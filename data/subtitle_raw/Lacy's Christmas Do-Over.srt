1
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:36,971
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

2
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,640
Fa la la la la, la la la la

3
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,268
'Tis the season to be jolly

4
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,997
This
Christmas, give the gift of love

5
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,481
from Lynn D. Jewelers.

6
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,334
Lynn D. Jewelers,
providing fine jewelry...

7
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,527
It's not even Halloween yet.

8
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,513
That's Lacy.

9
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,539
She needs to find
her Christmas spirit.

10
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,875
It's been gone
for a long, long time.

11
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,169
She was always on the nice list
and she truly loved Christmas,

12
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,048
but like so many,
things happen in life

13
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,342
that cause you
to follow another path.

14
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:19,013
Unfortunately, for this poor
girl, hers happened at Christmas.

15
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,683
She needs a good dose
of Christmas magic

16
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,645
and maybe a few do-overs
to get things right.

17
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,590
What time are you
gonna be there?

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,532
I need to get in
before Nora arrives.

19
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,742
She has something important

20
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,261
she wants to speak
with me about.

21
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,579
Which, between you and me,

22
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,416
I think she's going to finally
promote me to partner.

23
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,269
I'm there in five minutes, Lacy.

24
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,421
I'll have everything set up
for you and your big day.

25
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,258
I can get you that new peppermint
Christmas latte instead of your regular.

26
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,261
You know I don't want any
of that sweet holiday garbage.

27
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,597
I just want my
regular daily fix,

28
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,658
and I'm definitely gonna need it
to get through today.

29
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,602
I hate one-on-ones,
I hate surprises,

30
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,064
and most importantly, you know
I hate them at the holidays.

31
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm just teasing you, Lacy.

32
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,485
Just get in here
and focus on becoming partner.

33
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,489
I already have your iced half-caff
ristretto, Venti, four-pump sugar-free

34
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,658
cinnamon dulce, soy,
skinny latte ready for you.

35
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,326
See you shortly.

36
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,637
Or as I like to call it,
the Ice Queen's Happy Juice.

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,098
Mm, funny, funny, Raymond.

38
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,890
You'll definitely
get a job as a comedian

39
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,602
if this whole interior design
career doesn't take off for you.

40
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,664
Enjoy your drink while you can,
because Nora's already

41
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,207
in the conference room
waiting for you.

42
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,774
Surprise.

43
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,489
One, two...

44
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,211
Why didn't you tell me
that to begin with?

45
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,327
You know I hate surprises!
Did she get here before you?

46
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,205
Lacy, please,
no one gets here before me.

47
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,291
Look, for five years
we've worked together.

48
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,293
You are a talented,
brilliant woman.

49
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,853
You've worked your butt off
to get here,

50
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,629
and it's your time now.

51
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,357
So finish
your breathing exercises,

52
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,718
take your drink,
and go get what you deserve.

53
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,394
- Good morning, Lacy.
- Good morning.

54
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,314
- Oh, I so love the holidays.
- Oh.

55
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,525
This time of year
is just magical.

56
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,528
- Hmm.
- Definitely the best time to be in our line of work.

57
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,823
Oh, yes, it's such
a jolly good time.

58
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,175
If you're into
that sort of thing.

59
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,702
Get over yourself, my dear.

60
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,079
You will find yourself
appreciating

61
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,373
"that sort of thing" some day.

62
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,375
If anything,
you should appreciate

63
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,545
how high your sales
have been this season.

64
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,882
You are the star of our company.

65
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,552
And, Lacy, you have a remarkable
following with our clients.

66
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,722
We just landed
two very large accounts.

67
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,600
Oh, this holiday
is going to be spectacular.

68
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,852
What is that knocking?

69
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,188
Ah, moving on.

70
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,790
This office
is going to be so busy

71
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:02,236
that we all need to keep
a positive holiday energy.

72
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,239
Heading into
this holiday season, Lacy,

73
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,242
we can't afford
any more of your negativity,

74
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,744
and especially outbursts.

75
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,247
So because of all of this,

76
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,378
I want you to have a change about
your Christmas attitude. Hm?

77
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,423
Maybe try to have a smidge
of fun this holiday?

78
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,469
So that is why I am
bringing in someone to help.

79
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,762
What?

80
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,807
No, Nora, that is...
There is no need for that.

81
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,768
I have been doing this
for so long by myself,

82
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,770
I couldn't possibly
work with anyone else.

83
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,730
This has nothing
to do with the holidays.

84
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,273
Where is this coming from?

85
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,275
I've been working on this.
I'm not difficult.

86
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:45,238
I mean, I've been going to a therapist.
I'm more mindful.

87
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:52,245
I just have some issues
with the holidays.

88
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,789
Lacy, my niece just graduated

89
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,457
from the New York
School of Interior Design,

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,919
and I want you to mentor her.

91
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,841
Lacy, I once mentored you
and look what became of you.

92
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,343
I hope you do
the same for my niece.

93
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,430
I'm not asking you, Lacy.

94
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,808
And where am I supposed to find

95
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,937
this lovely and talented,
perfect Christmas gift?

96
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,608
Oh, she's right behind you.
Lacy, meet my niece, Jenna.

97
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,652
Nice to meet you, Lacy.

98
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,447
I'm such a huge fan
of all your designs.

99
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,782
I grew up
admiring all your work.

100
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,659
My Aunt Nora always tells me
I remind her of you.

101
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,620
I used so many
of your past designs

102
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,831
as inspiration
while I was at school.

103
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,668
I like to think my designs reflect
yours, just a little freshened up.

104
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,337
I'm sure you'll teach me
so many things.

105
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,507
Okay!

106
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,893
She seems nice.

107
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,854
What the hell
just happened in there?

108
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,355
I-I was ambushed.

109
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,857
"Freshened up."

110
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,692
Did she really
just say that to me?

111
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,028
What a condescending
little snot.

112
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,655
I thought I was going in there
for a promotion

113
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,866
that I have been
working so hard for.

114
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,036
And now I'm stuck babysitting
some spoiled little rich kid?

115
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,705
And who is Nora to tell me
that I'm stressed out?

116
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,875
And I have a temper, really?
I do not have a temper.

117
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,588
- Tell me I don't have a temper!
- What temper?

118
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,508
I've only ducked a couple
staplers these past few years.

119
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,426
Keep doing your breathing.

120
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,385
I don't hear you counting.

121
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:37,350
One, two, three,
uh-huh, yeah, breathe.

122
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,559
Now, seriously,
an extra set of hands

123
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,687
with all this work
could be good for us.

124
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,690
Why don't you take some time for yourself?
Balance the work.

125
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,901
Even try to enjoy the holiday.

126
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,405
You know, sing a carol,
indulge in some eggnog...

127
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,367
maybe even a
little holiday romance.

128
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,410
Maybe not.

129
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,413
But, look,
let's just give Jenna a chance.

130
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,749
I'm just saying,
how bad could she be?

131
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,442
Yay!

132
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,945
Where you going?

133
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:32,947
Are these your designs

134
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,615
for the new Underhill account?

135
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,117
Wow!

136
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,494
You have outdone yourself again.

137
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,138
I know you couldn't do it without me.

138
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,456
- Okay.
- Just sayin'.

139
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,458
Look, these guys are brand new,

140
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,978
and they came to us
so highly recommended.

141
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,461
I did a little extra work

142
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,147
and the deadline
isn't till tomorrow.

143
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,132
No stress, no outbursts.

144
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:51,674
We are ahead on all accounts,

145
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,468
and this is
the first deadline tomorrow.

146
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,971
Nora will be beyond impressed.

147
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,974
And you, you have been
very good with Jenna,

148
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,685
who surprisingly has been pretty
helpful, wouldn't you say?

149
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,438
She's entirely too bubbly
for my liking,

150
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,983
but yes, she has been
more helpful than not.

151
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,485
And speak of the devil.

152
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,446
I hope I'm not interrupting.

153
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,173
I wanted to let you guys know
that there are

154
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,117
candy cane cupcakes
that I made in the breakroom.

155
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,512
Better get in there quick,
though, 'cause they're going fast.

156
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,163
I think I saw Darryl eat three.

157
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,667
Darryl, all he does
is crunches numbers and eats.

158
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,837
You know,
Lacy loves candy canes.

159
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,048
Yeah, I'll go get us some.

160
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,841
Peppermint's her favorite.

161
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,176
Be nice.

162
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,644
I want to thank you
for being so nice to me, Lacy.

163
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,522
I'm watching you, absorbing everything
you say and do, like I'm a big sponge.

164
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,025
Oh, I'm such a dork
for saying that.

165
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,195
Are those the new designs
for the Underhill account?

166
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,405
- Mm-hmm.
- May I?

167
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,078
Lacy, these are fabulous.

168
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,664
I've never seen
anything like this.

169
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,583
You have to let me take you out
so I can pick your brain.

170
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,671
I know the perfect place that has a
Christmas martini with a peppermint twist.

171
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,565
It's perfect because you
love peppermint so much.

172
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,067
I wanna know
everything about you,

173
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,551
where you studied,
what your inspirations are.

174
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,720
I wanna know
who the real Lacy is.

175
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,431
That's great, Jenna.
I have to go find Raymond.

176
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,934
He can set it up,
but just for now, stay focused,

177
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,603
as the Underhills
are not our only account.

178
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,447
Too bad the Underhills

179
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,129
are the only account
that matters.

180
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,119
This firm's legacy is mine...

181
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,204
not yours, Lacy.

182
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,807
Merry Christmas, everybody.

183
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,976
I want to thank you
for working so hard.

184
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,603
We are getting close
to the holiday break,

185
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,982
and we are breaking records
this year.

186
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:17,778
I want to congratulate my niece
and newest member of our office

187
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,949
for outstanding performance
in just the first two weeks.

188
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:27,288
I received a call this morning
from Mr. James Underhill himself.

189
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:33,127
He was so blown away by the
designs my niece Jenna did

190
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:38,174
that he wants her and only her
to handle their account.

191
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,800
Breathe.

192
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,135
Oh, shoot.

193
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:45,931
Those designs are mine,
you-you elf witch!

194
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,641
I knew I couldn't trust you!

195
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,810
You have no idea
how to do those designs!

196
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,812
You've never even
spoken to the Underhills!

197
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,647
You can hardly handle
speaking on the phone

198
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,984
with your bubbly attitude
and your stupid holiday spirit!

199
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,111
You are more concerned with
passing out candy canes

200
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,988
than coming up with
any real ideas!

201
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,299
Well, you can take
those candy canes

202
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,658
- and shove them...
- Lacy, what are you doing?

203
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,660
Lacy, that is enough!

204
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,704
Jenna?

205
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:15,211
She's absolutely insane.
Of course those are my ideas.

206
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:19,173
You've told me how unhinged she can
become, this whole office knows.

207
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,675
Not only did I come up
with those ideas,

208
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,303
but I tried to do it
while providing this office

209
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,305
with some much-needed
holiday spirit.

210
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,017
It's like, not being
an old scrooge for the holidays.

211
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,854
Old scrooge? Oh, I'm gonna rip those
elf ears off your smug little head!

212
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,316
Now, enough everyone!
Lacy, that is it!

213
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,027
You need to
get a hold of yourself,

214
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,906
and try to learn to embrace
the Christmas spirit.

215
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,701
I don't want to see you back in
this office until the new year.

216
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,245
- That's final.
- Nora...

217
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,707
And if anyone else has anything
to say, they can leave, too.

218
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,377
But you won't have the luxury
of coming back in the new year.

219
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,588
Happy holidays.

220
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,175
Excuse me.

221
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,738
Lacy, why are you
packing all this up?

222
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,240
You'll be back
before you know it.

223
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,933
I highly doubt it, Raymond.

224
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,060
Don't you see
the bigger picture here?

225
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,896
Jenna has been
out for my job all along.

226
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,066
You've been my best friend
for more than five years now.

227
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,735
I care about you
more than an associate should.

228
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,780
This is about you.
No one else.

229
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,908
Think about it. Who gets
angry during the holidays?

230
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,911
You need to take this week
and figure out how to fix you.

231
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,247
You are a beautiful,
intelligent woman

232
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,750
who has no one in her life
but her dashing assistant.

233
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,378
It's time for you
to learn to relax, love,

234
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,964
and embrace the holidays.

235
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,924
On that note, I've scheduled you

236
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,093
an appointment tonight
with Dr. Noelles.

237
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,053
Who the heck is that?

238
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,098
Dr. Baker is on vacation
and his office suggested him.

239
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,642
And no buts, just go.

240
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,061
It's time for you
to work on you.

241
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,271
Merry Christmas.

242
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,647
No grumbling.

243
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,274
Mm-hmm. Mm-mmm.

244
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,445
Thank you, girl.

245
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,450
I want to thank you
for seeing me, Dr. Noelles.

246
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,970
I-I didn't realize Dr. Baker was
out of town for the holidays,

247
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,956
and I really needed to
speak with somebody.

248
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,791
I can't believe what happened.

249
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,337
Everything was going so great
until that little demon arrived.

250
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,797
And Nora just allowed her
to sabotage me,

251
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,133
and everyone at the office
adores her.

252
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,264
Why do bad things always happen
to me during the holidays?

253
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,976
Well, Lacy, I do
see that you have anger issues

254
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,812
that come from
an unresolved occurrence

255
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,190
that happened
during the holiday season.

256
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,193
It doesn't have anything to do
with any unresolved occurrence.

257
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,321
It's this little Elf on the Shelf,
just showed up and sabotaged me,

258
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,491
and I'm supposed to sit back
and let it happen? No way.

259
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,036
It doesn't have anything
to do with my past.

260
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,165
Lacy, you've
come to me for a reason.

261
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,337
You've become sarcastic
and angry during the holidays

262
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,839
for many years now,

263
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,985
but your temper
has nothing to do

264
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,970
with the holiday season.

265
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:15,391
Lacy, you only have
one life to live.

266
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:19,019
I believe that you need to
get out of this city

267
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,355
which has made you so hard.

268
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,525
You need to look at the big
picture in your life, Lacy,

269
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,362
and find what is truly missing.

270
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,740
- Where would I go?
- Funny you should ask.

271
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:36,203
It's a quaint little B&B
run by the Maguires

272
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,748
in the town of Oregon, Illinois.

273
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,377
I have a room
reserved for you for a week.

274
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:49,091
Go, spend Christmas there.
It's an enchanting place.

275
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:55,222
I promise you will find the
answers to all you are looking for.

276
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,393
Maybe even a little surprise.

277
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,063
Doctor?

278
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,191
Doctor?

279
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,288
I can't believe this.

280
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,416
I'm lost in the middle
of nowhere in a whiteout.

281
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,922
Where is this place?

282
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,435
Where did that storm go?

283
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,939
Oh, thank you very much.

284
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,821
Where were you
when the storm was happening?

285
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,325
Lacy, you need to be
around people now.

286
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,982
Welcome, welcome.
You must be Lacy.

287
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,359
Dear, you look so cold.

288
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,528
Can I get you some eggnog
to warm you up?

289
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,864
- A little toot never hurts anyone.
- Hi, hello.

290
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,660
No, that's not necessary. I'm actually
exhausted from the long drive.

291
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,329
That's a good idea, Marce.
Get us all a drink,

292
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,350
and then we can come and bring
our guest down here to sit

293
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,684
and we'll get to know
our visitor.

294
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,002
After all,
we promised Dr. Noelles

295
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,504
we'd take good care of you.

296
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,507
We are so lucky
Dr. Noelles sent you here.

297
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,384
You're our only guest
for the week.

298
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,178
We usually are
a packed house at Christmas.

299
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,473
Oh, I appreciate your hospitality.
If I could just see my room.

300
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,201
Oh, I hope you
like the holidays.

301
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,645
After all, Oregon's known
for its Christmas spectacular.

302
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,982
We have so many things scheduled
every day until Christmas,

303
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,192
and, hey, Marcy here,

304
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,902
she's a wonderful cook.

305
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,364
Especially her fruitcake.
Do you like fruitcake, Lacy?

306
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,366
Oh, Hank, stop teasing
the poor girl.

307
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,034
She looks tired from the drive.

308
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,369
Why don't we show her the room

309
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,371
so she can get some shut-eye?

310
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,039
You can take
your drink with you.

311
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,168
That's a good idea, Mar.

312
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,378
We do get up early
in these parts.

313
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,549
Early?
Yes, the room is a good idea.

314
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,052
Thank you both
for being so welcoming.

315
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:01,116
Now, uh, bathroom's private,
but it's at the end of the hall.

316
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,410
Kitchen's downstairs
in case you want anything,

317
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,954
however, we do all the cooking.

318
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,583
Oh, and, uh, breakfast,
it's when the rooster crows.

319
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,252
We're gonna let you be.
Come on, Hank, let's go.

320
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:16,131
We're gonna turn in ourselves.
We got a big day tomorrow.

321
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,426
Have a good night.
Jingle, jingle!

322
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,095
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

323
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,555
Fa, la, la, la

324
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,229
Very Christmassy.

325
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,447
Are you smiling at me?

326
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,115
Creepy little elf.

327
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,286
Great.

328
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,081
I'm talking to myself again.

329
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,250
Wonder what's in this drink.

330
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,311
You've got to be kidding me.

331
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,322
Could
someone shut that darn bird up?!

332
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,618
Where's my phone?

333
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,829
I need to call Raymond.

334
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,665
I just had it,
where could it be?

335
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,352
Oh, please, please,
please, please.

336
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,502
Please don't be broken.

337
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,340
Call Raymond.

338
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,510
Call Raymond!

339
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,855
I could've sworn
I turned you around last night.

340
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,481
Creepy little elf.

341
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:04,531
I need a hot shower, my latte,
and a working cell tower.

342
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,700
There's gotta be one
somewhere in this hick town.

343
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,755
Oh, good morning, Lacy.

344
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,256
How did you sleep?

345
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,817
I hope the room
was to your liking.

346
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,218
Marcy, the room was fine,

347
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,612
if not for the crowing
that woke me up,

348
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,429
but the shower had no hot water.

349
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,764
I froze my bottom off.

350
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,933
Hank, are we
having hot water problems?

351
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,143
No, the water's
working just fine.

352
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,562
Ice storm knocked out
the cell towers, though,

353
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,773
and the landlines are down, too.

354
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,775
Well, the chief will be by
in a little while.

355
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,443
He'll let us know what's what.

356
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,613
He always comes by for a slice
of Marcy's fruitcake.

357
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,617
Hey, you should take that plate and fill
it up with some of this fine spread.

358
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,953
I think I'm just gonna
grab a latte in town

359
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,639
and try and find
some phone reception.

360
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,474
I'm sure my office
is trying to get a hold of me.

361
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,750
Oh, I'm sure they are, dear.

362
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,795
Listen, this'll be here
every morning for you,

363
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,673
so why don't you try
and relax and enjoy it?

364
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,634
Thanks, but I don't think
I'll be staying long.

365
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,178
This may have been
a mistake for me.

366
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,472
I-I do appreciate you both,
but I think all of this

367
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,350
is just a bit
too festive for me.

368
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,311
Being festive
is what Oregon's all about.

369
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,789
You shouldn't miss
the Christmas festival.

370
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,191
Oh, the festival
is where I found my true love.

371
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,985
Jingle, jingle, Lacy!

372
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,342
It's time to get in your
car and get your job back, Lacy.

373
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,846
No phone, no hot water,
this place stinks.

374
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,693
Come on!

375
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,363
What the...?

376
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,704
Come on!

377
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,881
Everything all right here,
young lady?

378
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,675
I need to get out of here
and my car won't start.

379
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,887
Now why would you wanna get out of
this fine establishment so quickly?

380
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,556
The Maguires are some of
the finest people I know, Lacy.

381
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,445
I'm sorry, do I know you?

382
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,356
News travels fast in this here town.
I'm the chief of police.

383
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,751
I make it a point to know
who's coming into my town.

384
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,778
Kind of like
the welcome wagon, so...

385
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,738
welcome.

386
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,949
Great, uh, Chief...?

387
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,576
Melville,
but you can call me Brody.

388
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,372
Great, Brody. Um, any way you
could use your CB thinga-majigy

389
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,582
or walkie-talkie
to call me a mechanic?

390
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,424
You're in luck.
In a town this small,

391
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,094
I'm not only chief of police,
I'm the mechanic, too.

392
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,929
Please, pop your hood.

393
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,941
Well, Lacy, you want
the good news or the bad news?

394
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,901
The way my life's been going,

395
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,736
just hit me
with the bad news first.

396
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,113
Your alternator's kaput.

397
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,907
I can fix it, but we need to
order the part first.

398
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,076
How long is that gonna take?

399
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,453
Being it's so close
to Christmas,

400
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,957
if we order it now, probably
not more than a few days.

401
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,626
I'll call Deputy Donner
to bring the tow truck.

402
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,504
- Thanks, Sheriff. Thanks, Chief.
- Mm. Mm.

403
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,464
Why don't you give me
the good news?

404
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,966
Well, now...

405
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,136
you get to join me inside

406
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:39,431
for a slice of Marcy Maguire's
famous fruitcake.

407
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,610
Well, you didn't get
very far, Lacy.

408
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:55,113
Oh, Brody, how 'bout a cup
of coffee and some fruitcake?

409
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,615
What happened?

410
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,534
- My car died.
- We'll get it fixed.

411
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,119
She just needs a new part.

412
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,121
I'll order it
after I have my fruitcake.

413
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,999
Lacy, what can we do
to cheer you up?

414
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,001
I just need to get to town.

415
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,712
I need to check in
with my office, my friends.

416
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,049
That'd be Raymond, but I need to
let them know I got here safely.

417
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,636
Even if you get into town, I don't think
you'll have any luck with the phones.

418
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,531
Maybe I can get an email out? I mean,
how are you gonna order the part?

419
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:24,684
I'll order it after the phones are
back in service, obviously.

420
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,896
Lacy, if you need to get to town,
I'm sure Jakey can take you.

421
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,565
Of course,
that's a great idea, Marcy.

422
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,192
He'll be back any minute.

423
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,694
Great.
Is he the town's mayor

424
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,738
who just also happens to be
the town's taxi?

425
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,080
Hey, there.
Welcome to the Pinehill B&B.

426
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:50,710
I see you met Mom and Dad, but
they didn't tell me about you.

427
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,088
Lacy, this is our son Jakey.

428
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,757
He's headed to town to pick up
some Christmas lights.

429
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,093
He runs our Christmas tree farm.

430
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,237
Jakey, maybe you could
take her to town with you?

431
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,889
I'd really appreciate
a ride to town, Jakey.

432
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,701
It's not a problem, provided you
love the smell of Christmas trees

433
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,019
because the truck
is covered in pine needles.

434
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,690
Oh, I love the smell
of pine needles.

435
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,459
I just really
need to get to town.

436
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,735
Alrighty. Giddy up.

437
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,922
Oh, don't forget to pick up
the Christmas wreaths.

438
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,448
Hey, you gonna bring back
our special package with you?

439
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,866
Sure thing, Pop.

440
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,958
Oh, good.

441
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,753
That was quick.

442
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,089
Thanks.

443
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,103
So, you in a goth band?

444
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,941
I dress chic, unlike you,
the poster boy for Carhartt.

445
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,153
Okay. Well, what brings you
to town, Elvira?

446
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:02,615
I was told that to get into the
Christmas spirit, I should come here.

447
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,077
I wanted to leave, but my car broke
down, and no phone reception, so...

448
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,496
Well, I've already been there.
No cell service,

449
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,338
but I can definitely try to get
you into the Christmas spirit.

450
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,835
I'd like that, Jakey.

451
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,087
Is that what I should call you?
Or do you prefer Jake?

452
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,799
I prefer Jake.
Sounds more chic, right?

453
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,969
Anyway, we're here.

454
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,290
Stop it!

455
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,879
Oh, hi there, Jakey.
Where you been hiding yourself?

456
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,356
At the Christmas tree farm,
Rosie.

457
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,858
Where I always am
this time of year.

458
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,176
And who do we have here?

459
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,179
I've not seen you before.
And I know everyone.

460
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,724
I'm Lacy. I'm looking for
a phone or internet connection.

461
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,871
You're not gonna find
that anywhere, hon.

462
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,730
Not after that ice storm.

463
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,857
Listen, hon,
why don't I make you

464
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,694
some of my nice,
delicious Christmas glug

465
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,072
and a slice
of homemade pumpkin pie?

466
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:27,575
Oh, I shouldn't.
And I don't know what glug is.

467
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,203
Oh, it's a bit of a warm
Christmas cocktail.

468
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,181
You should try some,
but I'll warn you,

469
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:32,956
too much will
knock your socks off.

470
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,210
- It's too early for a drink.
- It's five o'clock somewhere.

471
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,837
Hm-hm.

472
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,255
Lacy, what have you got to do?

473
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,340
Come on, I'll get you one.

474
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,360
Let's get to know each other
a little better.

475
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,593
Come here.

476
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,239
I'll be back
to pick you up in a few.

477
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,224
You two ladies, be nice.
Especially you, Dot.

478
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,725
Hm?

479
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,937
He's right. You'll see.

480
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,234
You see, Lacy,
glug is like truth serum.

481
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,028
One sip and you'll be
crowin' like a rooster.

482
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,864
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

483
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,200
- All right.
- Cheers.

484
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,633
So how did you land the most
eligible bachelor in town?

485
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,761
Stop, I had no idea
he was eligible or a bachelor.

486
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,930
I just hitched a ride with him
to get to town.

487
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,224
I have to get back to
my life in Chicago.

488
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,660
There are people there
depending on me.

489
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,311
Raymond is depending on me.

490
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,146
I'm sure he's trying
to get a hold of me.

491
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,398
Well, I don't know
who this Raymond is,

492
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,734
but Jakey is a fine catch.

493
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,112
And we both saw the way you two
were lookin' at each other.

494
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,114
All the girls
in this little town

495
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,796
- would love to be in your place.
- Mm-hm.

496
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,161
Especially me.

497
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,788
I wasn't looking at him
in any way.

498
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,956
I just met him.

499
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,475
We definitely
have nothing in common.

500
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,294
Oh, I second that,
based on the way you dress.

501
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,172
- Okay!
- What is with my clothes?

502
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,257
This is very city chic.

503
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,009
Well, in case
you hadn't noticed,

504
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,261
out here we dress
Christmas chic.

505
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,488
Christmas chic!

506
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,143
Now, Lacy, Christmas
is full of surprises,

507
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,146
and Jake can be
your Christmas surprise.

508
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,774
I wish he was
my Christmas surprise.

509
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:26,486
Wrapped up in a big red bow.

510
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,154
It's happenin' for you.

511
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,010
- You are so bad, I'm tellin' you!
- No! No!

512
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,994
She... If you hang around
her too long...

513
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,955
No, it didn't happen like that.

514
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,708
- Yes, it did.
- Well, I see you all enjoyed the glug,

515
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,502
especially you, Dot.

516
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,879
Shh!

517
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,315
All right,
I hate to break this soiree up,

518
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,383
but I gotta get some stuff
back to the inn.

519
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:52,178
Well, tell your mom I hope she
enjoyed the pumpkin pie I sent over

520
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,348
- and tell her to join us next time!
- All right, you got it.

521
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,019
Oh!

522
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:08,361
And, Lacy,
enjoy your Christmas surprise!

523
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,075
Ooh! Oh, my goodness.

524
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,369
Miss?

525
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,329
Hold your horses!

526
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,915
Can't you see
we're busy over here?

527
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,878
Careful.

528
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,431
You must be Lacy.
Do you like fish?

529
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,516
What-what do you mean,
do I like fish?

530
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,101
I've been ice fishing all day.

531
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,423
This is the biggest one
I caught.

532
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,775
Jake, this is
the cutest little boy.

533
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,569
He just told me
he's been fishing all day.

534
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,362
Little boy?

535
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,197
Little boy?!

536
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,074
How rude are you?

537
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,784
I'm a ten-year-old girl!

538
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,912
You just probably haven't ever
seen a girl with a fish like this.

539
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,082
Well, maybe where I'm from,
little girls don't fish.

540
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,251
Out here,
little girls do fish, Lacy.

541
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,086
Meet my daughter, Faith.

542
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,212
Daughter?

543
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,100
Merry Christmas, Lacy.

544
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:23,436
This is what you get
for calling me a boy.

545
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,112
- Jingle, jingle!
- Jingle, jingle!

546
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,909
- Ooh!
- Come here, you!

547
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,286
- Oh, how you doin'?
- Good, good.

548
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,121
- Did you have a fun time today?
- I did.

549
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,123
- Oh, catch a lot of fish?
- I did.

550
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,627
Just like your grandpa.

551
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,969
Lacy...

552
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,472
a little bird told me
you had some glug today.

553
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,973
How did you like it?

554
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,517
Ooh, some of my eggnog

555
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,203
would be perfect for happy hour.

556
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,020
I could really use that
right about now.

557
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,980
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

558
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,525
Fa la la la la, la la la la

559
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,319
'Tis the season to be jolly

560
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,321
Fa la la la la, la la la la

561
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,874
You've got to be kidding me.

562
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,502
That bird again?

563
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,050
Could someone
shut that darn bird up?

564
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,682
Where's my phone?
I need to call Raymond.

565
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,226
I just had it,
where could it be?

566
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,521
Oh, please, not again.

567
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,156
Okay, little man.

568
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,533
Let's let Mrs. Maguire
turn you around this time.

569
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,082
At least my fuzzies are dry.

570
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,216
Please, God,
let there be hot water.

571
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,236
Marcy's workin' overtime.

572
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,720
Oh, good morning, Lacy.

573
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,407
How did you sleep? I hope
the room was to your liking.

574
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,725
Marcy, the shower
had no hot water again.

575
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,144
Hank, are we
having hot water problems?

576
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,271
No, the water's working fine.

577
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,082
Ice storm knocked down
the cell tower, though,

578
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,484
and the landlines are down, too.

579
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,653
Well, the chief will be by
in a little while.

580
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,488
He'll let us know what's what.

581
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:24,408
He always comes by for a slice of
Marcy's fruitcake in the morning.

582
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,744
Hey, you should take that plate
and fill it up

583
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,329
with some of this fine spread.

584
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,082
I need to go to my car.

585
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,417
I'm sure my office is trying to
get a hold of me by now.

586
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,127
I'm sure they are, dear.

587
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,256
Listen, this spread'll
be here every morning,

588
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,300
so why don't you try
to relax and enjoy it?

589
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,302
Hey, have a great day.

590
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,347
Yeah, Hank,
you told me that yesterday.

591
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,369
It's back. My car's back.

592
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,871
Everything okay here,
young lady?

593
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,356
Are you kidding?
You were supposed to fix my car.

594
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,568
Now why would you wanna get out of
this fine establishment so quickly?

595
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,529
The Maguires are some of
the finest people I know, Lacy.

596
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,323
Chief, I met you yesterday.

597
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,259
News travels fast
in this here town.

598
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,701
Now, I'm the chief of police.

599
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,887
I make it a point to know
who's coming into my town.

600
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,582
I'm kind of like
the welcome wagon, so...

601
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,708
welcome.

602
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,210
What is going on?

603
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,421
Chief Melville,
but you can call me Brody.

604
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,256
Okay, now this is
really too bizarre.

605
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,680
What is happening?

606
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,434
You're in luck.
In a town this small,

607
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,228
I'm not only chief of police,
I'm the mechanic, too.

608
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,439
Please, pop your hood.

609
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,406
Well, Lacy, you want
the good news or the bad news?

610
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,634
Forget it, let's just go inside
and get your fruitcake.

611
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,577
Your alternator's kaput.

612
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,455
Okay, the good news.

613
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,497
Well, now...

614
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,542
you get to join me inside

615
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,754
for a slice of Marcy Maguire's
famous fruitcake.

616
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,387
Well, you didn't
get very far, Lacy.

617
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,640
Brody, how about a cup of coffee
and some fruitcake?

618
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,267
- What happened?
- I'm going insane.

619
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,145
We'll get it fixed.
She just needs a new part.

620
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,606
I'll order it
after I have my fruitcake.

621
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,484
Lacy, what can we do
to cheer you up?

622
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,612
I need to get to town. I need
to get in touch with my office.

623
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,633
Even if you get into town, I don't think
you'll have any luck with the phones.

624
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,784
You already told me that, Brody.

625
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,178
How are we gonna order
the new part?

626
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,287
Well, I'll order it
after the phones

627
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,331
are back in service, obviously.

628
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,809
Lacy, if you need to
get to town,

629
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,644
I'm sure Jakey can take you.

630
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,254
Of course,
that's a great idea, Marcy.

631
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,588
He'll be back any minute.

632
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,841
When does he get here?

633
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,760
Hi there.
Welcome to the Pinehill B&B.

634
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:35,683
I see you met Mom and Dad, but
they didn't tell me about you.

635
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,852
Lacy, this is our son Jakey.

636
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,479
He's headed to town to pick up
some Christmas lights.

637
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,982
He runs our Christmas tree farm.

638
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,210
Jakey, maybe you could
take her to town with you?

639
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,653
I really need a ride
in your truck, Jakey.

640
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,465
It's not a problem, provided you
love the smell of Christmas trees

641
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,825
because the truck
is covered in pine needles.

642
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,662
- Oh, definitely. Let's just go.
- Giddy up.

643
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,807
Oh, don't forget to pick up
the Christmas wreaths.

644
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,333
Hey, you gonna bring back
our special package with you?

645
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,710
Sure thing, Pop.

646
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,345
So, you in a goth band?

647
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,347
No. Are you the town comedian?

648
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,309
Ouch. I'm just having fun
with you, Morticia.

649
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,854
So where are we
going today, Jakey?

650
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,523
First of all, I prefer Jake.

651
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,901
Secondly, I'm headed to
my Christmas tree farm.

652
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,546
If you're trying to get in the
Christmas spirit, it's a magical place.

653
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,822
I've never seen
anything magical, Jakey,

654
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,908
and I'm really not one
for the holidays.

655
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,580
All right, well,

656
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,057
I'll bet you
one of my mom's fruitcakes

657
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,333
that you'll agree with me.

658
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,043
I don't eat fruitcake,

659
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,878
but I'll take that bet.

660
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,546
Alrighty. Giddy up.

661
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,426
So this is where
you sell the trees from?

662
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,929
This place is pretty big
to just be supplying for Oregon.

663
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,933
Oh, we're actually the major supplier
for the entire Northwest region.

664
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,937
Every Christmas, we send the
trees out about a month before.

665
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,440
Ones that are for next year
are over there.

666
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,734
Those are the leftovers
from this year.

667
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,070
And about a mile that way...

668
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,781
you'll find the ones
for ten years from now.

669
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,450
You know, we've gotta
protect our ecosystem.

670
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,430
I never get tired of this view.

671
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,849
Especially at this time of year.

672
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,018
Yeah, this is...

673
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,853
this is pretty impressive.

674
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,457
Well, if we head this way,
I can show you the barn.

675
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,001
I bet you say that
to all the girls, Jakey.

676
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,671
No, no girls, Lacy,
not for a while now.

677
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:59,678
Don, I need your help.
I got stuck.

678
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,390
Faith, that is a two-person saw.

679
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,201
How'd you get it
that far in there?

680
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,896
She's short, but she's strong.

681
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,196
Oh, howdy, Jake.

682
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,437
You gonna introduce us
to your friend there?

683
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,201
Don, this is Lacy.

684
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,495
Otherwise known as
Cruella de Vil.

685
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,164
She makes Cruella look nice.

686
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:31,043
Okay. Enough with the clothes
jokes, cowboy. Let's call a truce.

687
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,920
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Lacy.

688
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,548
And don't listen to them.
I think you look fine.

689
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,884
Might even be
the prettiest girl in town now.

690
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,889
Hey, miss, have you ever
used a two-person saw before?

691
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,184
I bet you haven't.

692
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,562
I bet you haven't cut anything
other than using scissors.

693
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:54,525
Faith, Lacy's probably never
done anything like this.

694
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,777
She probably doesn't wanna
get dirty, either.

695
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,072
Yeah, she definitely doesn't wanna
get those spiffy clothes dirty.

696
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,074
I'm not afraid of getting dirty.

697
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,869
Of course I've sawed before.

698
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,913
Gimme the saw.

699
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,118
Faith, what were you thinking?

700
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,619
You could have
seriously hurt someone.

701
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,478
It's okay. I'm-I'm fine.

702
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,771
Really, it's-it's all good.

703
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,110
I'm okay.

704
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,489
Kids...

705
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,615
you can't live with 'em

706
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,784
and you can't sell 'em.

707
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,123
She's a feisty one, isn't she?

708
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,916
You have any kids, Don?

709
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,006
Who, me? Kids? No!

710
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:03,761
I'm the town's MEB,
most eligible bachelor.

711
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:07,598
But, uh, no one's got me yet.

712
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,200
Let's talk about
what's really on your mind.

713
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,851
You mean Jake?

714
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,936
Okay. What's his story?

715
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,606
Oh, Jake's the best guy in town.

716
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,983
He treats everybody
like they're family.

717
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,694
But that poor guy...

718
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,656
Life has put him
through the ringer.

719
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,286
He had Faith and got married
right after high school.

720
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,663
He moved from Oregon to Chicago.

721
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,540
They had a nice little house
in the suburbs,

722
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,959
and they were very happy.

723
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,295
Until...

724
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:44,009
one snowy night,
his wife, Amanda...

725
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,346
she was killed
by a drunk driver.

726
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,225
His whole world was shattered.

727
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:56,021
So he brought his baby
back home to Oregon,

728
00:46:56,063 --> 00:47:01,151
and it's been him and Faith
and the whole town ever since.

729
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,656
He's a good dad and a good man.

730
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,702
And we all treat his daughter
as if she's our own,

731
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:14,706
and, you know,
naturally that might be why

732
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,084
Faith has a little bit
of an issue with you.

733
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:21,171
She's feisty, but she's just
trying to protect her dad.

734
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:25,676
But the one thing that
little girl needs most is a mom.

735
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,596
Wow, I had no idea.

736
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,723
That's terrible.

737
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,227
Hey, um...

738
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,689
I don't know if you're up for
it, but let's take a walk.

739
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,192
Faith's gonna stay in there for a little
while just to collect her thoughts,

740
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,114
and she'll be out
to apologize soon enough.

741
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,613
She does not
need to apologize to me.

742
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,091
That was some good competition.

743
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,408
I needed that.

744
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,411
I haven't done
a double saw in forever.

745
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,621
Ah, you looked like a pro
out there, Lacy.

746
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,983
Yeah, I'll be sure
to tell my bruises that.

747
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,627
I want to thank you
for being so nice to me.

748
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,922
This time of the year
isn't usually so festive.

749
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,050
Yeah, well, I wanna apologize
to you about Faith.

750
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,303
She can get like this
with new ladies around.

751
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,433
Are there new ladies
around often?

752
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,060
No, not really.

753
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,937
In this town,
it's usually tourists,

754
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,832
and that's not anything
I'm looking for anyway.

755
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,902
So she can have her fun with them.

756
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,238
It's, uh... it's especially hard
for her around the holidays.

757
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,408
Yeah, Don told me what happened
to you guys. I'm so sorry.

758
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,410
Must be really hard
for you, too.

759
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:37,456
Look, uh, when I said that there
were no new girls, I meant it.

760
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:41,793
I was very lucky to have an
extremely special relationship

761
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,129
that brought me
the joy of my life.

762
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,965
Now I just focus on being
a good dad and a better person.

763
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,426
Maybe that's it for me.

764
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,428
I know it sounds cheesy, but...

765
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,305
it works for us.

766
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,307
Don says that you're
the best guy in town,

767
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,434
so I think
you're doin' pretty good.

768
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,687
Yeah. Thanks.

769
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:04,316
But I'm sure you noticed that Faith
is a little rough around the edges.

770
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,558
I'm sure she picks that up from her
number one role model being her daddy.

771
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,156
So what about you?

772
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,967
What brings a city gal
like yourself

773
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,701
out to Oregon, lllinois?

774
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:19,373
Well, I was told I was overworked
and unpleasant to be around,

775
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,833
so I was actually sent here,

776
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,170
as Oregon is the place to get
into the Christmas spirit.

777
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,173
You know, I really didn't think
I was gonna enjoy it over here,

778
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:32,177
but I have to admit,
I'm having a really nice time.

779
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,579
I can see why
you like it so much.

780
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,348
The trees are beautiful.

781
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,141
Each one's like a work of art.

782
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,852
That's my designer eye speaking.

783
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,538
Well, don't go
wearing flannel on me now.

784
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,189
Ah, I would not be
caught dead in one.

785
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,316
Okay, okay.
I think you could pull it off.

786
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,836
We'll get you a blinking light
sweater, some reindeer ears,

787
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,029
and a cute little elf costume.

788
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,325
Here, have a peppermint cupcake!

789
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,371
Well, now,
see how happy you look?

790
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,544
I told you
these trees are magical.

791
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,756
Especially this one.

792
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,927
This is the pride and joy
of Pinehill Farms.

793
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,557
Magic, huh?

794
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,517
Maybe you can find some way

795
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,185
to try and convince me.

796
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,914
I think I might
know how to do that.

797
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,274
Oh, Dad...

798
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,085
You're showing
your magic Christmas tree.

799
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,404
Sorry to interrupt.
I just had to apologize.

800
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,865
Oh, you don't have to
apologize to me, Faith.

801
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,284
We were just having
a friendly competition, right?

802
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,785
You're right.

803
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,538
But I still wanna say
I'm sorry, Lacy.

804
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,916
You look like you need to be
more in the Christmas spirit.

805
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,295
So I figured an early
Christmas gift would be nice.

806
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,262
Good work, Girdy.

807
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,315
I hate that rooster!

808
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,283
Take that, you stupid bird!

809
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,120
I hate the wind, too.

810
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:26,583
All right, where is my phone?
I need to call Raymond.

811
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,295
I just had it,
where could it be?

812
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,661
Hey, rooster!

813
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,330
Hope you're hungry!

814
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,676
Oh, good morning, Lacy.

815
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,136
How did you sleep?

816
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,530
I hope the room
was to your liking.

817
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,031
Marcy, ask Hank
about the hot water.

818
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,974
Hank, are we having
hot water problems?

819
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,684
No, the water's working fine.

820
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,019
Ice storm knocked down
the cell towers...

821
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,189
I know about the ice storm, Hank.
I need to go to my car.

822
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,909
Ha!

823
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,372
I'm going insane.

824
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,916
This is not possible.
How can it be the same day?

825
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,727
Everything okay here,
young lady?

826
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,004
Okay, Brody.
Why is my car still sitting here

827
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,547
when I need to
get out of this place?

828
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,008
Now why would you wanna
get out of a fine establishment

829
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,551
like this so quickly?

830
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,053
The Maguires are some of
the finest people I know, Lacy.

831
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:05,074
You're the chief, the mechanic, the
town's welcome wagon, yada, yada, yada.

832
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,683
Just go inside
and get your fruitcake.

833
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,537
News travels fast in this here town.
I'm the chief of police.

834
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,063
I make it a point to note
who's coming into my town.

835
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,691
I'm kind of like
the welcome wagon, so...

836
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,234
welcome!

837
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,237
Great, Chief. Don't worry,
I'll call you Brody.

838
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,084
Hi there.
Welcome to the Pinehill B&B.

839
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,463
Jakey, I need to
get out of here,

840
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,465
so just take me
wherever you're going today.

841
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,091
Okay, I'm game.

842
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,986
But you just gotta
answer me one question.

843
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,095
Oh, don't say it.

844
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,741
Goth? Beatnik? Oh, no, you're a Cure fan.
No, no, no, no.

845
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,410
You were headed to a poetry slam
festival, took a wrong turn,

846
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,144
and ended up in Christmas town.

847
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,631
Don't you ever listen to
a different song?

848
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,323
Well, I'm not picky

849
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,658
and besides, it's the holidays

850
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,459
so any Christmas song
is fine with me.

851
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,291
Okay, explain that!

852
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,812
That's a pretty good
coincidence,

853
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:17,796
considering the fact the town

854
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,421
has one radio station

855
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,258
and all the buttons
are programmed to it.

856
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,345
Where are you going today,
Jakey?

857
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,347
I'm just headed to
the town square.

858
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,474
Gotta pick up
my special little package.

859
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:33,645
- You mean Faith.
- Yeah, that is who I'm going to pick up.

860
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,831
We've got a whole day planned.
You're welcome to join us.

861
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,691
Oh, I will definitely join you.

862
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:41,486
That little package is just
full of surprises, isn't she?

863
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,655
It's about time Faith
gets a surprise.

864
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:47,200
Great. You're gonna love Faith.

865
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,161
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

866
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,372
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

867
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,833
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

868
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,502
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

869
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,171
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

870
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,632
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

871
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,218
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

872
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,721
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

873
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,181
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

874
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,850
La-la-la-la

875
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,690
Hey, it's Jake!

876
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,483
Oh, hey.

877
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,864
Sorry, I was aiming for my dad.

878
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,381
Let's call a truce
and get these boys!

879
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,507
All right, Lacy.

880
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,596
- Yeah!
- Get 'em, Faith!

881
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,726
No!

882
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,901
All right, all right,
cease fire, cease fire.

883
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,903
Ooh! All right, come on.

884
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,864
Let's get some hot chocolate,
on me. Come on.

885
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,121
- Alrighty.
- All right, I need...

886
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,415
- Just keep pouring 'em.
- Alrighty.

887
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,416
Here's one.

888
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,126
I want the marshmallows in it.

889
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,628
Marshmallows, all right.

890
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:25,590
I can't believe you're actually
having fun with me.

891
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,765
It looks like you
kinda like my dad.

892
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:40,271
Um, well, he seems like
a really nice guy.

893
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,233
You know, your dad has a quality

894
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,610
I've never seen
in someone before.

895
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,779
Does that bother you, Faith?

896
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,614
Because I know how much
you love your dad,

897
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,450
and I would never wanna
take that away from you.

898
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:59,249
You see, Lacy, it's always
just been me and my dad.

899
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,293
The problem is

900
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,629
I've seen ladies
look at my dad...

901
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:09,968
but he never looked at them
the way he looks at you.

902
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,931
And you don't like that,
do you, Faith?

903
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,602
Faith, I know you lost your mom
when you were little.

904
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,982
No one is ever
going to replace her.

905
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,942
I'm sure your mom
was an amazing lady

906
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,653
who loved both you
and your daddy very much.

907
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,989
And I'm sure she'd want you
both to be happy.

908
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,365
Don't you think?

909
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,493
Yeah, I guess so.

910
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,706
I just don't want
anything to change.

911
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,792
I like things the way they are.

912
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,005
Funny thing about change,

913
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,841
as scary as it can be sometimes,

914
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,844
change can be a nice surprise.

915
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,973
Have you ever been married,
Lacy?

916
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,976
Nope. Not yet.

917
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,354
Almost, but it didn't work out.

918
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,523
Were you sad
when it didn't work out?

919
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,904
I guess.

920
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,533
Is that why you wear all black?

921
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,328
What is it with you people
and my black clothes?

922
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,371
I just think it looks chic.

923
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,040
Well, maybe a good change

924
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,018
would be putting some color
into your wardrobe.

925
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,711
Okay, come on, you crazy girl.

926
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,004
Let's go rescue your dad.

927
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,565
We can see who can
put the most whipped cream

928
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,548
in their hot cocoa.

929
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,050
Ooh, I love whipped cream!

930
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,510
You're on.

931
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,448
I'm going over with my friends.

932
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,559
Hey, Lacy, if you want to know
where there's mistletoe,

933
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,895
it's over by
the big Christmas wreath!

934
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,406
Wow. You're amazing.

935
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:58,910
She hasn't taken to
anyone like that ever.

936
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,871
Well, I was a snowball champion
when I was little.

937
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,373
- Really?
- No.

938
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,767
I don't think I've ever
been in a snowball fight

939
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,917
in my entire life.

940
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,919
I was just trying to
survive those kids.

941
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,813
Well, you certainly
held your own.

942
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,465
They can be pretty rough.

943
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:16,094
You guys really hit it off.
She was actually smiling at you.

944
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,555
She actually made fun
of my clothes, too.

945
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,723
Yeah, yeah.

946
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,826
The apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

947
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,977
Clearly.

948
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,647
She's a good girl, though.

949
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,460
She's adorable.

950
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:53,131
And I don't say that about...
any kids.

951
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,428
So, uh...

952
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,639
what's your story, Lacy?

953
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:06,603
Never married, no kids,
always workin'.

954
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:11,357
How'd a beautiful girl
like yourself not get tied down?

955
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,820
Tied down as in married,
kids, or both?

956
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,529
You tell me.

957
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,158
Okay, here we go.

958
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,995
Um, I was in a relationship
for quite some time.

959
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,663
Blake was his name.

960
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,834
Both of us were always working.

961
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,671
You know, we were successful
and enjoying life,

962
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,007
and making money
and traveling together.

963
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,675
It was just...
It was so much fun,

964
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,803
but I didn't realize
how fast the time was going by.

965
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,682
And I started to notice
that Blake wanted more

966
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:48,019
and that he was ready
to take the next step.

967
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,189
I was young and brash

968
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,567
and completely
immersed in my career.

969
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,862
I told him that
marriage and kids

970
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,990
may not be what I wanted
in the future.

971
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,871
I'll never forget the look on his
face when he walked out of the room.

972
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,083
I never thought he would
just up and leave, but he did.

973
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:16,547
I came home from work
Christmas Eve and he was gone.

974
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:19,092
All he left
was a note that said,

975
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:24,222
"Lacy, I wanted to give you
a fresh start Christmas Day."

976
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:27,558
Well, that, uh,

977
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,019
certainly makes things
a little clearer for me.

978
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,563
A broken heart
on Christmas would...

979
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,233
certainly taint
the holidays for anyone.

980
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,238
But I personally think
that Blake is the one

981
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,074
who made the mistake
leaving you.

982
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,618
I mean,
you seem pretty happy now.

983
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,121
And look how you
connected with Faith.

984
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:52,041
Maybe it's time we mend
that old Grinchy heart of yours.

985
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,254
And how do you
expect to do that, Jakey?

986
01:01:56,295 --> 01:02:02,593
Well, I've got one or two old
Christmas surprises up my sleeve.

987
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:07,098
That's funny, the reason I was told to
come here was for a Christmas surprise.

988
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,934
Well, what a surprise.

989
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,062
We're sitting under mistletoe.

990
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:19,819
Yeah, I've been told the most unforgettable
kisses happen under mistletoe.

991
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,948
- La, la
- La-la, la

992
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,159
Out jumps good old Santa Claus

993
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,786
Down through the chimney
with lots of toys

994
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,497
All for the little one's
Christmas joys

995
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,249
Ho, ho, ho Who wouldn't go?

996
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,792
We should go find Faith.

997
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,509
So, this is where the
Christmas festival takes place.

998
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,636
Yeah.

999
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,638
I mean, they work all year
just to set it up,

1000
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,141
and people come from
far and wide just to see it.

1001
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,811
You basically can't come through
the town without experiencing it.

1002
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,330
Well, I mean,
that all sounds good,

1003
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,524
but I don't think
I have anyone to go with.

1004
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,319
Well, uh...

1005
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,155
I think I can help with that.

1006
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,657
As long as you don't mind
sharing me with another lady.

1007
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,662
Hey, you two,
can we get something to eat?

1008
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,206
- Yes.
- All right, come on.

1009
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:19,128
So, as I was saying,

1010
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:23,841
usually Faith and I
make a day of it every year.

1011
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,552
But based on what I saw today,

1012
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,555
I don't think Faith would mind
if you joined us tomorrow.

1013
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,849
So what do you say, Faith?

1014
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:35,019
I would be honored
to join you and Faith tomorrow.

1015
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,146
I really want to spend the day
with you tomorrow.

1016
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,065
The festival is so much fun.

1017
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,859
Now let's get some food.

1018
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,028
- Food.
- Yes!

1019
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,201
She's so beautiful
when she's sleeping.

1020
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,703
This is the only time
that she's quiet.

1021
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,039
I bet.

1022
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,334
But you really are doing
an amazing job with her.

1023
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,378
She's quite the smart
young lady.

1024
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,383
So, uh, you looking forward
to tomorrow?

1025
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,718
Yes, I really am.

1026
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,930
I think I might stick out
like a sore thumb.

1027
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:14,392
Maybe I can borrow one of Faith's
light-up Christmas necklaces?

1028
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,894
I'm sure she's got
plenty to spare.

1029
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:21,190
If not, we'll just throw a big
red bow on you and call it a day.

1030
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:29,699
Thank you for such
a wonderful day today, Jake.

1031
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,410
It's been a long time

1032
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:37,874
since I felt anything good
around the holidays.

1033
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,627
I opened up to you about...

1034
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,921
Look, you don't
need to explain, Lacy.

1035
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:48,050
You know, I...
I know we've all got a past,

1036
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,761
but it's what makes us
who we are today.

1037
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:55,933
Believe me, life will
throw you some curveballs,

1038
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,437
but it's what you
make of 'em that counts.

1039
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,774
I'm not the same person
I was ten years ago,

1040
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:07,236
and I doubt
that you are, either.

1041
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:15,119
Does it seem weird
that I'm only just now

1042
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:19,457
figuring out who I am and what
I want my life to look like?

1043
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,462
I feel like I've been running
away from change for so long

1044
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:27,173
that I've missed out
on something

1045
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:30,468
that could have been
extraordinary.

1046
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:33,262
Yeah, but change is scary.

1047
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,766
But, you know,
if you don't embrace it,

1048
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:40,047
you'll never know what extraordinary
journey you're missing out on.

1049
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,981
I've always believed that

1050
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,001
people come into
and out of your life

1051
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:49,487
at different times
and different reasons.

1052
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,489
As I've always said,

1053
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,992
you've just got to have
a little faith.

1054
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,830
Faith.

1055
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,165
That's a good one.

1056
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,002
I do appreciate your point,
though.

1057
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,048
And, honestly, I've never
connected with a kid

1058
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,841
as much as I did with her today.

1059
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:17,181
Well, looks like
we got you home.

1060
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,365
Well, you, my dear,
I will see tomorrow.

1061
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,866
Mm-hmm.

1062
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,910
I'll be the one
with the big red bow.

1063
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,264
I'm sure we can
find you something

1064
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,498
a little less noticeable.

1065
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,041
Eh.

1066
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:51,257
Ah, I've gotta get you
to try some of Rosie's glug.

1067
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:52,943
Hope you're ready
to have fun tomorrow.

1068
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,553
I'm going insane.

1069
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:41,557
Now I know I'm going insane.

1070
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,310
Lacy, you've got to
snap out of this.

1071
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,479
This can't be real.

1072
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:53,069
Christmastime is a time
of love and forgiveness.

1073
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,612
Get over yourself, my dear.

1074
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,073
You will
find yourself appreciating

1075
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,283
"that sort of thing" someday.

1076
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,452
It's time for you
to work on you.

1077
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,413
The festival is where
I found my true love.

1078
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:09,126
Lacy, enjoy
your Christmas surprise.

1079
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:13,464
One thing that little girl
needs most is a mom.

1080
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:17,468
You need to look at
the big picture in your life, Lacy.

1081
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,273
That old bird is right on time.

1082
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,367
Ooh! lt's cold.

1083
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,328
Hmm, where is my phone?

1084
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,334
Nice catch.

1085
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:56,966
December 24th.

1086
01:08:57,006 --> 01:08:59,135
Twenty-three missed calls.

1087
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:02,989
Lacy, it's Raymond.

1088
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,057
Call me back
when you get this message.

1089
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,518
Just want to make sure
you got there all right.

1090
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,979
Hey, there,
bet you're not calling me back

1091
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,540
because you've met someone and
finally enjoying the holidays.

1092
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,029
Who am I kiddin'?
Just call me back.

1093
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:22,408
Lacy, it's Raymond, call me back.
I really need to talk to you.

1094
01:09:22,448 --> 01:09:25,493
Crazy stuff going on
here at the office.

1095
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:31,709
Lacy, where are you?
Call me back, it's urgent.

1096
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,045
Nora's asking for you.
She is not happy.

1097
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:42,386
Okay, Nora told me I need to be
keeping better tabs on you.

1098
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,680
I must not be doing my job.

1099
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:46,575
Well, I told her if she
hadn't told you to beat it,

1100
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,517
she wouldn't be
in this situation.

1101
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,731
Okay, I didn't actually say
that, but she's looking for you.

1102
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,069
Hello, Lacy, it's Nora.

1103
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,238
If you can call me back
as soon as possible,

1104
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,365
I'd like to discuss
a few things with you.

1105
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:05,284
I'm at the office
and I'll be about...

1106
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,083
Time to wake up.

1107
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,422
Cold shower, here I come.

1108
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,436
Marcy is really
working overtime.

1109
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:51,288
Hot water. Yes!

1110
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,415
There is actually hot water!

1111
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,310
Well, hey, creepy little friend.

1112
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,772
Maybe you're a little cute.

1113
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:19,316
No, not quite.

1114
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,487
Oh, good morning, Lacy.

1115
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,216
How did you sleep? I hope
the room was to your liking.

1116
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,160
Thanks, Marcy. Yeah, I got
a good night's rest last night.

1117
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:33,122
The shower finally had hot water,
it felt amazing this morning.

1118
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,375
Oh, Lacy, a fella by the name
of Raymond called for you.

1119
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:39,712
Left a couple of messages,
sounded quite urgent.

1120
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:45,175
Oh, he also said you would really
enjoy this drink in the morning.

1121
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:49,847
We've never heard of an iced
half-caff, four-pump, sugar-free,

1122
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:53,183
cinnamon skinny
something or other.

1123
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:54,685
Sounds pretty fancy to me.

1124
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,146
Hank had to drive two towns over

1125
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:59,732
just to find a place
that would make one for you.

1126
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:03,360
You gotta keep
the guests happy, right, Marcy?

1127
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,653
It's Christmastime.

1128
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,238
Wow, thank you, Hank.

1129
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,490
I can't believe
you would do that for me.

1130
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,245
Mmm...
Oh, this hits the spot.

1131
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,681
I guess my office
was worried about me

1132
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,224
since they haven't been able
to get a hold of me

1133
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,542
- the past couple of days.
- I'm sure they are, dear.

1134
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,837
Listen, this spread'll
be here every morning,

1135
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:25,215
so why don't you just try
and relax and enjoy it?

1136
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,509
It all looks delicious.

1137
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,762
To be honest,
I woke up famished this morning.

1138
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,555
Must be all
the fresh country air.

1139
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,849
Are you headed to
the festival today, Lacy?

1140
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,618
I was planning on it
since I heard it was

1141
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,394
the event of the year
in this town.

1142
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,397
Maybe I'll get a few ideas
for future projects.

1143
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,568
Only trouble is I don't think
I have the right outfit for it.

1144
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,364
Well, maybe we can
help you with that.

1145
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:52,242
Marcy's got so many of those
Christmas sweaters around this house,

1146
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:55,287
I'm sure we can find something
that'll suit you just fine.

1147
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:58,248
I know just the one,
it'll fit you perfectly.

1148
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,876
Go, go, go.

1149
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:04,755
- Well, hello, folks.
- Oh, Brody, come in.

1150
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:08,717
Just stopping in for my jet fuel
and that delicious fruitcake.

1151
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,761
Who's ready
for the big day today?

1152
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,138
Well, we were
just talking about that.

1153
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,807
Uh, Marcy's helping Lacy here.

1154
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,559
She's gonna get out of
those city clothes, finally.

1155
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:20,145
Well, good for you.

1156
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,957
We can't have you going into
our festival wearing all black.

1157
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:26,443
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, but you'll see.

1158
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:30,906
Here we dress what you city folk
might call "Christmas chic."

1159
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,634
I've heard that
from someone before.

1160
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,952
I brought your sporty
little car back, Lacy.

1161
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,955
Ooh, she's fast.
It's as good as new, though.

1162
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:40,624
Oh, um, great.

1163
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,793
Well, I thought
you'd be thrilled.

1164
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,795
I mean, I worked overtime on it.

1165
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,439
You said you had to
get back to the city.

1166
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,465
No, I-I do. You're right.

1167
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:49,925
Thank you, Brody.

1168
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:54,596
Lacy,
your festival outfit awaits!

1169
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:58,308
Go, go, go!

1170
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:02,521
- Shall we?
- Let's.

1171
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,482
Drumroll, please!

1172
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:07,985
I'm proud to present

1173
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:12,614
the honorary queen
of the Oregon Festival!

1174
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:20,372
Well! Look at you.

1175
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,708
You're pretty enough
to be on a Christmas card.

1176
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:25,711
Everything fit her perfectly.
I still got it.

1177
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,981
Well, that sweater looks like
it was made just for you.

1178
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,508
It really does fit perfectly.
I hope it looks okay.

1179
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:39,016
Well, well, well.

1180
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:41,560
Look what we have here.

1181
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,872
Somebody's ready to hit the
festival, wouldn't you say, Faith?

1182
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:47,024
You look pretty, Lacy.
I want you to wear this.

1183
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:48,901
We can be matchers.

1184
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,569
Thanks, Faith.

1185
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,530
I don't think I've ever owned
anything like this before.

1186
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,990
Do you think I'll fit in?

1187
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,409
I think you look perfect.

1188
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,914
I think red's your new black.

1189
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,876
You're still a big city gal
to me, Lacy.

1190
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,712
Well, I think we are all ready
for the festival.

1191
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,715
Let's go have some fun.
Giddy up, Faith.

1192
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:15,552
Remember, bein' festive
is what Oregon's all about.

1193
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,888
Lacy, you forgot your drink.

1194
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,893
Yuck, this is gross!
What is this?

1195
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,437
It's an acquired taste, Faith.

1196
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,064
Bye, Grandma.

1197
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,565
Jingle, jingle!

1198
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,754
- Merry Christmas, Jake.
- Merry Christmas.

1199
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:24,454
Hey, Lacy.
I'm going over with my friends,

1200
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:28,584
but I want you to know,
I'll be thinking about you.

1201
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,461
Well, if you need to find me,

1202
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,463
just look for
the blinking lights.

1203
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,848
- I am one lucky dad.
- You are the best dad.

1204
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,808
You don't sound
so committed to that.

1205
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,650
I love her, she's my daughter.

1206
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,645
Lacy!

1207
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:52,649
We told you'd land the most
eligible bachelor in town!

1208
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:57,446
Too bad, Jakey. I could've
been all yours!

1209
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,991
- Okay, girl!
- Whoo!

1210
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,702
It's true.

1211
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,163
So, is this too Christmassy

1212
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,165
for your all-black
designer world?

1213
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:12,669
Stop! No, I think
it's absolutely beautiful.

1214
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:15,172
I can completely see why this
takes a full year to set up.

1215
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:17,633
Well, don't go
stealin' our ideas now.

1216
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:19,652
We've got patents
on all these designs.

1217
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:23,013
And if I do steal them,
what you gonna do about it?

1218
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:28,685
Well, I might just have to lock you
up for a long time and keep you here.

1219
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,020
Does that sound so bad?

1220
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,689
Oh, I don't know.

1221
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,858
I guess I could
make the best out of it.

1222
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,028
Just so I don't have to dress like
Santa's little helper every day.

1223
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,696
Hmm...

1224
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,911
How are you two kids
enjoying this magnificent day?

1225
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:47,889
Can't say it could've
turned out any better.

1226
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,541
Don, you always have
such perfect timing.

1227
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:54,419
Well, you know I like to
make my presence known.

1228
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:58,924
- And you look ravishing, my dear.
- Oh, why, thank you. So do you.

1229
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,885
That's the only way this old
fool can kiss a girl anymore.

1230
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,571
Mistletoe doesn't even
work for him.

1231
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:06,181
He's gotta blind 'em
with his tie.

1232
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,849
Stop it.

1233
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:09,059
All right, well,

1234
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,895
let's go get some
of Rosie's famous glug.

1235
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,749
All right,
you better be careful.

1236
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,775
One glug is one too many.

1237
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,902
Oh, believe me, I know.

1238
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,928
What are you two
squawkin' about?

1239
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,037
Dot is saying that her Yule log

1240
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,748
is better than
your mom's fruitcake.

1241
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,917
My Yule log is so much better,

1242
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,753
I don't have to put "famous"
in front of it.

1243
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:39,131
Well, my fruitcake is "famous"

1244
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:42,259
because it's won awards
in three separate counties.

1245
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,594
I'd take the fruitcake
over the Yule log.

1246
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,763
That's convenient,
you're her husband.

1247
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:49,099
- Well, you're her best friend.
- Yeah.

1248
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,059
You two, weigh in.

1249
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,644
I plead the fifth.

1250
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,606
Oh, um, well, unfortunately,

1251
01:18:56,648 --> 01:19:00,277
I haven't had Yule log
or fruitcake before.

1252
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:03,155
We didn't have
Christmas treats in my house.

1253
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,991
This is perfect.

1254
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:09,661
Lacy has never had
either of these, ever.

1255
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,622
She will judge the winner!

1256
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,125
Oh, I...

1257
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,002
Why does she get both?

1258
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:20,297
Well, Faith, Lacy has never had
Yule log or fruitcake,

1259
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:22,591
so she's gonna try
Grandma's fruitcake

1260
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:25,302
and Dot's Yule log
and decide which is best.

1261
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,304
Faith, please help me eat these.

1262
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:31,641
No way. With these crazy
ladies, you're on your own.

1263
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,143
Thanks, Faith.

1264
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,645
Okay, everyone,
I will do my best,

1265
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,939
but please don't
hold it against me.

1266
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:46,156
Oh, it's so good.
So creamy and smooth.

1267
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:48,200
Oh, this texture's
just like tiramisu.

1268
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:51,328
You need to clean your palate
before you taste mine, Lacy.

1269
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,342
It's chewy.

1270
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:10,013
There's some fruit,
there's a cherry.

1271
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:13,141
And... there's a nut.

1272
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,728
Oh, can I have
some more glug, please?

1273
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:25,195
Lacy, it's an acquired taste.

1274
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,697
I think we know
who the winner is.

1275
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:30,200
Now, now,
I've got my Christmas treats.

1276
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:34,037
Who wants some of my homemade
caramel and candy apples?

1277
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,373
I love candy apples!
I'll have one.

1278
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:42,712
Caramel apples are way better.
I'll have one.

1279
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,172
Okay, how about my favorite?

1280
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,843
Christmas fudge,
nuts or no nuts?

1281
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:50,345
- Nuts. Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Nuts. Nuts.

1282
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:55,058
Looks like you're gonna be
needed a bit more.

1283
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,895
I think my favorite
Christmas treat is you.

1284
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,236
Who's that?

1285
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:13,076
Nora? Raymond?
What-what are you doing here?

1286
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,871
Lacy, we've been trying
to get a hold of you for days.

1287
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:17,873
Oh, ice storm
took down the lines.

1288
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:20,792
They've been down a few days.
Just went back up today.

1289
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:23,211
I'm, uh, Jake Maguire.

1290
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:28,967
My parents, Marcy and Hank.

1291
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,053
They own the B&B that Lacy's
staying at here in town.

1292
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:35,432
Everyone, this is my boss, Nora,
and my associate, Raymond.

1293
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,934
We work together back in Chicago
at the design firm.

1294
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,770
Would you like to try
some of my famous fruitcake?

1295
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:44,774
How about a plate of the Yule
log that just won the taste test,

1296
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,777
- according to Lacy?
- She did not pick yours.

1297
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:50,280
I have candy
and caramel apples for you.

1298
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:53,116
Oh, do you like fudge
with nuts or without?

1299
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,993
I'll bring you two mugs of glug.

1300
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:57,454
No, thank you.
No, thank you.

1301
01:21:57,495 --> 01:22:00,290
No, thank you, sir, thank you.
I don't do fruitcake.

1302
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,148
There's drinks
here or something?

1303
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,259
Lacy, I made a mistake.

1304
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:15,472
Jenna has made a mess
of our two largest accounts.

1305
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,475
Well, she admitted to me
that she stole your designs.

1306
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:21,144
She couldn't
come up with anything.

1307
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:24,147
And now those two clients
say that they will walk away

1308
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:28,026
unless you come back
and head their accounts again.

1309
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:32,781
I made a mistake, but my mistake
was not listening to Jenna,

1310
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:36,284
it was not promoting you
to partner.

1311
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:39,788
Now, don't let
my little mishap with Jenna

1312
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:42,999
deter you from what
is rightfully yours.

1313
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:46,294
Lacy, just say yes!

1314
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,339
This is what
you've always wanted.

1315
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,508
I am so honored and flattered

1316
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:54,135
that you came
all this way to say this to me.

1317
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:57,847
I know you, you wouldn't
do this for just anyone.

1318
01:22:57,889 --> 01:22:59,849
Lacy, are you gonna leave us?

1319
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,018
Please, don't go.

1320
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,023
If you had asked me this
two weeks ago,

1321
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,484
I would've
jumped at the opportunity.

1322
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:13,029
I was so ready for it.
I was anticipating it,

1323
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:16,366
and I was so furious
when it didn't happen.

1324
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:21,371
I lost part of myself
and what I needed in life.

1325
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:23,748
I met someone wonderful

1326
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,875
who told me that certain people

1327
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,937
come in and out of your life
for different reasons.

1328
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,547
And I need to believe that.

1329
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:35,552
I wanna start living my life
and being happy.

1330
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,512
So...

1331
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:42,267
as much as I would love
to accept your amazing offer,

1332
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,894
I have to decline.

1333
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:49,566
But, Lacy, you're willing to
just give up on your dream?

1334
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:51,401
I wouldn't say that.

1335
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:55,572
I think that people's dreams
can change,

1336
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:59,534
and I think I want
to start sharing mine.

1337
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:03,121
This stuff is fabulous!

1338
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:06,082
Such a distinct taste,
I could drink it all day.

1339
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:09,919
Nora, I do have one
recommendation for the company.

1340
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,881
My replacement
should be Raymond.

1341
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:14,591
- Raymond?
- Me?

1342
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,259
Yes, Raymond, you.

1343
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,471
Nora, I've never worked with
anyone so talented.

1344
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:22,891
Our clients know Raymond
and they love him.

1345
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:28,104
I can't imagine anyone else better
suited to take lead than Raymond.

1346
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:30,440
Well, Raymond,
we don't have much time.

1347
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:31,959
We need to
get back to the office

1348
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:33,151
and hammer out the kinks

1349
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,945
that were created by
you know who.

1350
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:41,117
I just wish it could have
turned out slightly different.

1351
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,287
Thank you so much for everything
you've done for me.

1352
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:46,122
Merry Christmas.

1353
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,083
Merry Christmas, Lacy.

1354
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:58,426
Lacy, are you sure
this is what you want?

1355
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:02,972
Raymond, the craziest thing has
been happening since I got here.

1356
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:06,935
I feel like I've been living the
same day over and over again,

1357
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:12,023
but it made me realize that I
have a second chance at true love.

1358
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,984
A Christmas surprise.

1359
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:18,279
How many times
have I been telling you that?

1360
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:20,490
Wait a minute,
you don't like surprises.

1361
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:24,327
Who is he, okay?
Not that Deputy Don character.

1362
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,495
No.

1363
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:32,335
Okay! Stud alert!
Good for you, Lacy.

1364
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,963
Merry Christmas, you guys.
Be nice to my friend.

1365
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:37,507
Little word of advice,
she hates surprises.

1366
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:42,029
Hey, everyone, I'd like to get
some glug to go if possible.

1367
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,972
It was so good!

1368
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,518
Nice to meet you all.
Truly a pleasure to meet you.

1369
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,645
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

1370
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,278
Does this mean
you're staying, Lacy?

1371
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,698
Well, I don't know if you heard
what just happened here,

1372
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,993
but I don't actually have a job
to go back to anymore.

1373
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:09,372
So I was hoping you'd be willing
to let me spend Christmas with you.

1374
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:15,545
Now, Faith,
no more tricks, right?

1375
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,381
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1376
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,009
Merry Christmas, Lacy.

1377
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:28,683
Well, I don't suppose
you heard all that.

1378
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,228
Yeah, you could say that.

1379
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,440
Well, it's out there now,
and it's pretty awkward,

1380
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:38,568
but the truth is they're right.

1381
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:45,533
I haven't been much fun to be around
at Christmas for a long time now,

1382
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:50,622
but you, Faith,
and this crazy, crazy town

1383
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:53,583
have helped me find myself again

1384
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:57,962
and really believe in Christmas.

1385
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:01,257
I can't tell you what's been
happening since I got here,

1386
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:06,763
but yesterday we just had
the most amazing day together

1387
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:08,598
and I didn't want it to end.

1388
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,435
I was so worried I'd wake up and
you and Faith wouldn't be here.

1389
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:16,147
And then there was
this reindeer,

1390
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,274
and you and Faith
covered in gold.

1391
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:19,734
And then I woke up again,

1392
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:23,446
and I-I know I'm not making
a lot of sense right now,

1393
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,741
but the point is,

1394
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:30,453
I finally figured out
what my Christmas surprise is

1395
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,581
and it's all
that matters to me now.

1396
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:38,461
You and Faith are my
Christmas surprise, Jake.

1397
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:42,257
Well... I'm glad that
you figured that out

1398
01:27:42,298 --> 01:27:45,260
because you're our
Christmas surprise, too, Lacy.

1399
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:01,776
You know, Jake, I'm gonna need one
more Christmas surprise from you.

1400
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,611
What's that?

1401
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:06,364
I'm gonna need you to kiss me
under that mistletoe again.

1402
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,161
Yep, that's me.

1403
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,831
Merry Christmas, Lacy.

1404
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:17,333
Merry Christmas, Jake.

1405
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:26,384
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!

1406
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:33,349
Well, Lacy finally
got her Christmas surprise.

1407
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,727
She may have repeated
a few days to find it,

1408
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:39,147
but the Christmas spirit
will always find you.

1409
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:42,567
And in Lacy's case, she found
love through Christmas do-overs,

1410
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:46,571
eventually figuring out that life
is always filled with surprises.

1411
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:49,198
Embracing them enabled her
to find what she was missing.

1412
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:53,745
Lacy found her true love and she
was gifted the love of a child.

1413
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:57,206
That's the ultimate
Christmas surprise.

1414
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:59,542
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

1415
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,211
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1416
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:04,714
'Tis the season to be jolly

1417
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,383
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1418
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:10,345
Don we now our gay apparel

1419
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:12,847
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1420
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,725
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol

1421
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:18,561
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1422
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,397
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

1423
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,108
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1424
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,736
'Tis the season to be jolly

1425
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:29,405
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1426
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,616
Don we now our gay apparel

1427
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:34,410
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1428
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:37,413
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol

1429
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,750
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1430
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:44,587
I love everything
about Christmas.

1431
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,131
Fast away the old year passes

1432
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,634
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1433
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:52,261
Hail the new year
lads and lasses

1434
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:54,806
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1435
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:57,600
Sing we joyous all together

1436
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,311
Fa la la la la, la la la la

1437
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:02,772
Heedless of the wind and weather

1438
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:08,277
Fa la la la la, la la la la
