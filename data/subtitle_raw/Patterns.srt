1
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,635
Good morning, Miss Lanier.

2
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,198
If you're this early, you'll
have to take the local.

3
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,379
Alright, Phil.

4
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,658
20th floor Executive, Miss Lanier.
- Thank you, Phil.

5
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,783
Good morning, Miss Lanier.
- Good morning, Martha.

6
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:26,504
I couldn't find a cab anywhere.
- Such a lovely day though.

7
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,693
40th Floor Executive.
Ramsey & Company. Miss Stevens.

8
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,659
I'm sorry sir, our switchboard
doesn't open until nine.

9
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,047
You'll be able to reach
him shortly thereafter.

10
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:41,037
Ann.

11
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,456
That's correct, sir.

12
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,678
Mr Staples begins with
the company today.

13
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:48,063
I'll leave your message on his desk.

14
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,993
Ann, put this on Mr Staples' desk.
- Yes, ma'am.

15
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:55,344
Mr Staples will be in Mr Quinn's
old office, Executive Corridor.

16
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,484
Yes, I know.

17
00:02:57,964 --> 00:03:00,846
I said deliver it, not read it.
- Yes, ma'am.

18
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,643
Executive. 40th Floor. Miss Stevens.

19
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,617
Morning.
- Hi.

20
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:14,929
Good morning, madam.

21
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,179
What did Marge say?
She has to work next door?

22
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,321
Oh no.

23
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:20,412
I'm glad I don't.
- Not there.

24
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,772
They really fixed up a new
Exec's office for him, didn't they.

25
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:26,263
Very nice.

26
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:27,772
A new man.

27
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,864
Right next door to your boss.

28
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:32,409
And awfully close to Mr Ramsey.

29
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,684
It so happens that the new man.

30
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,275
What's his name?

31
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:37,991
Staples?
- Uhuh.

32
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,689
Will be working with Mr Briggs.

33
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:41,714
They try to have adjoining offices.

34
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:44,543
Marjorie baby, you're awfully defensive.

35
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,651
I guess that's because you're
worried about your Mr Briggs.

36
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,026
Run along, will you.

37
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,820
May I have some more cream, please?

38
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:18,841
Next car, please. Next car.
Next car, please. Okay.

39
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:20,658
Next car.

40
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:27,350
Harry, Charlie, Joe. Express down.
No stops. We're jammed.

41
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,503
Next car, please. Next car. Next car.

42
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,243
Good morning, Mr Ramsey.
Next car, please.

43
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,599
Thank you, Lenny.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,494
<i>Miss Lanier. We've seen him</i>.

45
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,372
<i>He's here</i>.
- Thank you, Martha.

46
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,142
Chief operator, please.

47
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,865
Miss Phillips, you can put the long
distance calls through to Mr Ramsey.

48
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,179
Portland, Dallas, St Louis offices.

49
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,205
Good morning, Mr Ramsey.
- Good morning, Miss Lanier.

50
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:22,980
Any messages?

51
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:26,842
Calls are placed for our Portland and
Dallas offices. Nothing else important.

52
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,201
Martin Tool & Die.
You said you'd wired him.

53
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:31,126
Yes, you'll find a copy in my briefcase.

54
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:33,795
You are right as usual.
Nothing important.

55
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,871
I have the Portland
report in my briefcase.

56
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,277
I want it teletyped this
morning to Seattle.

57
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:43,053
Have someone there drive to Portland
and get it to Johnson before lunch.

58
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,743
Run off 20 copies.
Confidential mimeographing.

59
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,887
Have them ready for the board meeting.
I want it on the agenda.

60
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,840
Has Mr Staples arrived yet?
- Not yet, sir.

61
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,631
Delay the meeting until
ten this morning.

62
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:58,201
To give you time to get the
report mimeo'd and distributed.

63
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:00,362
I want it read, and carefully.

64
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,791
Get word underground
to the secretaries ..

65
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,403
That no-one can count on making
any early luncheon appointments.

66
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,734
Make a note.

67
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:10,178
Staples is to sit one down
from Vandeventer on my left.

68
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,508
Yes sir.

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,495
Let me know as soon
as Mr Staples arrives.

70
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,664
Yes, Mr Ramsey.

71
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:47,493
Well.

72
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,409
Fred, here we are.

73
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:50,966
Yeah, here we are.

74
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,359
A little different
to Mansfield, isn't it.

75
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:57,457
Now I know what a mother feels when her
child goes to school for the first time.

76
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,884
Goodbye, mother.

77
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,156
It looks <i>big</i>, doesn't it.

78
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:04,391
Give me a chance, honey.
Maybe I can cut it down to my size.

79
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,975
I'm a little late.
- Shall I call you when ..

80
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,195
No, no. You go on home
after you finish shopping.

81
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,113
Find a garage somewhere
midtown to park the car.

82
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,430
I'll phone you on what
train I'll be on. Bye-bye.

83
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,303
Goodbye, darling.

84
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,616
Ramsey & Company.

85
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,877
Yes, sir. Executive or Administrative?

86
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,821
The Executive. Mr Ramsey.
- 40th floor, sir.

87
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,260
Morning. Morning.

88
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,055
You want the tower, sir.

89
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:57,231
The tower elevator, sir.

90
00:07:58,318 --> 00:07:59,620
It will be down in a minute.

91
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,059
Sorry. Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

92
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,551
Good morning, Ed. Good morning.
- Good morning.

93
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,452
Good morning. Good morning.

94
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,859
Good morning, Jamie.
- Good morning, Bill.

95
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,729
Morning, Marge. How was the weekend?
- Fine.

96
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:16,959
Letters are on your desk.
Coffee is here any minute.

97
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,445
I can use some coffee.
- Did you get any rest at all?

98
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,539
Couldn't take my kid
to the double-header.

99
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:22,574
Shame.

100
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,458
That planning report is going
to be a real job, Marge.

101
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,838
This will be a big week for
you too, with that thing.

102
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,573
I believe we'll try a rough first draft.
- Long?

103
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,529
No longer than the telephone directory.

104
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:33,821
Phew.

105
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,434
Marge.

106
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,444
Has Mr Staples come in yet, Marge?

107
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,809
No, sir.

108
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,165
Mr Staples?
- Yes.

109
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,190
I'm Margaret Lanier,
Mr Ramsey's secretary.

110
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,616
How do you do.

111
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,609
Mr Ramsey would be here to welcome you
himself but he has a long-distance call.

112
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:53,685
May <i>I</i> take you back to your office?

113
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,112
Thank you very much.

114
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,700
On our way, I might show you
some of our other departments.

115
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,100
Have you met Miss Stevens?

116
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,323
I introduced myself, Miss Lanier.
- Fine.

117
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,193
And may I bid you my
own personal welcome.

118
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,861
We're very glad to see you.

119
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,776
That's very nice of you. Thanks.

120
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,780
If you come with me, Mr Staples.

121
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:14,873
Miss Stevens.

122
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,749
Marketing and Sales are below here.

123
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,177
We have our own research
department on the 40th floor.

124
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:20,982
Perhaps you'd like to see that later?

125
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:22,843
This is the Executive Corridor.

126
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:26,428
Mr Ramsey's office is that
one down at the end.

127
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,733
Then Mr Jameson, head of purchasing.

128
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,730
Mr Briggs. You'll be working
closely with Mr Briggs.

129
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,041
Mr Vandeventer, Chief Engineer.

130
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,559
And this is <i>your</i> office.

131
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:46,676
Isn't it nice?

132
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:49,039
I hope you like it.

133
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,726
Mr Ramsey was told by your office that
you're especially fond of this period.

134
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:58,287
Wasn't your office in Mansfield
furnished in early American?

135
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,958
My furniture consisted
of two filing cabinets ..

136
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,930
And a surplus metal desk
off of a destroyer escort.

137
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,924
No, it's ..

138
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:10,475
It's really very attractive. Very.

139
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,676
I appreciate it very much indeed.

140
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,639
Excuse me, Miss Lanier.
Ann said you wanted to see me.

141
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:19,064
Yes, Marge.
Mr Staples, this is Miss Fleming.

142
00:10:19,738 --> 00:10:20,639
How do you do.

143
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:24,117
Marge, see Mr Staples has all he
needs in the way of office equipment.

144
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,133
It was arranged for this morning
at Mr Briggs' suggestion.

145
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,140
I must rush now, Mr Staples.
Again, a most cordial welcome.

146
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,340
Thanks very much.

147
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,480
Marge, stop by my desk when
you finish here please.

148
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:36,952
Yes, Miss Lanier.

149
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:44,906
I think I'd better explain the
phone system, Mr Staples.

150
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,600
There are four lines.

151
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,036
One, is your private
line direct to outside.

152
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,802
Two is for conference calls.

153
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:52,432
Three is for inter-office.

154
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:55,150
Four. This button is for your secretary.

155
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:57,539
I'm sorry. May I?

156
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,279
Yes. Thank you.

157
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,077
Yes, I think I have that.

158
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,721
Let me see.

159
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:05,870
Outside, inter-office ..

160
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,103
Conference and ..

161
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:10,061
Yes, that's ..

162
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,403
That's fine.

163
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,952
Thank heavens this isn't early American.

164
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,623
Busy?

165
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,550
No .. not at all.

166
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,257
You must be ..?
- Bill Briggs, your next-door neighbor.

167
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,069
Yes, of course.
I'm sure glad to meet you, sir.

168
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,605
I think Mr Ramsey told me
you'd been sick, didn't he?

169
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,315
Did he? Actually, it's just ..

170
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,769
Just a pesky stomach that's
been acting up on me.

171
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,395
You in from Mansfield?

172
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,979
Yes, they took a house for us.

173
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,712
Sit down, Mr Briggs.

174
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:43,961
Settled already?

175
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:45,171
Good.

176
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:48,207
I'm not trying to set myself
up as a real New Yorker.

177
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,535
Altoona, Pennsylvania.
That's where I came from.

178
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,195
My first trip home, I was wearing spats.

179
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:55,883
I remember my father not
being able to get over it.

180
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,113
He says 'Bill'.

181
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:58,484
'Bill', he says ..

182
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,032
'You went to New York to see the sights,
and instead you became one of them'.

183
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,739
We just got here Friday afternoon.

184
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,495
So this morning, Nancy
insisted .. my wife.

185
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,385
Insisted on driving me to
work on the first morning.

186
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,773
You know the way women are.

187
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,944
You know, you come out
of a .. small-town plant.

188
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,496
You feel a little lost
in a place like this.

189
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,220
As I was saying. We walked into
our house Friday afternoon.

190
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:28,266
We'd never laid eyes
on the place before.

191
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:30,945
There it was. Furnished like a magazine.

192
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,271
Milk in the icebox.
Bourbon on the shelf.

193
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,296
I don't know. You must hand it to
them the way they do things here.

194
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:40,193
Yes. Miss Lanier handles all that.
Does a fine job.

195
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,041
That feeling I got driving
into town this morning.

196
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,106
I got to admit it's just ..

197
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:50,747
It's just a little overwhelming.

198
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,452
Yes. It's a pretty wonderful
thing to be as young as you are.

199
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:58,500
And see it all spread out
in front of you like a ..

200
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:00,794
Like a Christmas tree.

201
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:04,452
You know .. you think of ..

202
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,669
You think of big business.
You always think of it as being ..

203
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,375
Very impersonal .. you know ..?

204
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:12,639
But ..

205
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,618
It's really not true
with your Mr Ramsey.

206
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,490
I know what you mean.

207
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,080
How much time did you put in Mansfield?

208
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,447
Almost six years.

209
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:28,423
You must have blown a bugle in Ramsey's
ear in Ohio. He got you here in a hurry.

210
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:33,162
Actually, I wasn't sure I wanted
to come to New York. But ..

211
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:37,148
This Ramsey is a pretty dynamic man.

212
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:38,848
Yes .. I know.

213
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,944
You see, you've been with the
firm some time now, haven't you?

214
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,913
Oh, maybe forty years or so.

215
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,960
I seem to recall Mr Ramsey talking
about you as a production man.

216
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,232
You're an engineer, aren't you?

217
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,034
Yes, but ..

218
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:58,237
From what he told me, I guess I'll
be a little of everything around here.

219
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:00,452
Mostly, in industrial relations.

220
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:03,840
Industrial relations?

221
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:08,094
As a matter of fact, it's
been one of my specialities.

222
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:10,170
We ..

223
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:13,156
We ought to get along
pretty well together.

224
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,906
I'm sure we will.

225
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,662
Excuse me.

226
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,424
Mr Ramsey has called a meeting in
the conference room, Mr Briggs.

227
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:21,588
Oh?

228
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,482
Well, Fred. It was a real
pleasure meeting you.

229
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:25,561
Thank you.

230
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,396
Mr Ramsey is expecting Mr Staples too.

231
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:33,341
Then, I'll go in with
you if you don't mind.

232
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:34,949
Not at all.

233
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:39,814
I just hope Mr Ramsey
remembers hiring me.

234
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,137
Mr Ramsey rarely forgets anything.

235
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:45,312
After you.
- Thank you.

236
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,066
Staples?
- Yes.

237
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:48,045
Hello.

238
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,191
Fred, this is Harvey Jameson.
Head of purchasing.

239
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,549
How are you?

240
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,505
So they finally finished it.
- What?

241
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,911
Fred, your office. On Friday the
painters were here. It was a madhouse.

242
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,442
Hey Bill, are you taking
along Ramsey's breakdown?

243
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,535
No. I forgot that.
A few other things I forgot too.

244
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,933
Jamie, you two go in together.
I'll be a minute.

245
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:05,790
Fine.

246
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,428
Lanier gave you the Cook's tour?

247
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,309
You saw the conference room?

248
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,147
Yes. On the other side? Yes.

249
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:13,958
Mr Briggs.

250
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:15,997
What is it, Marge?

251
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,522
I don't know.

252
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,549
Mr Briggs, I think I ought to resign.

253
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:25,881
Resign? What are you talking about?

254
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,924
What happened? What is it, Marge?

255
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,031
Mr Briggs, I've just been ordered to go
over to Mr Staples as his new secretary.

256
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,572
Temporarily.
- No, I don't think so.

257
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,995
Who gave this order?
- Miss Lanier.

258
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:39,177
When?
- About five minutes ago.

259
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,887
You're supposed to break
in your new secretary.

260
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,522
They've picked a new secretary for me?
- Yes, I think so.

261
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:50,357
Out of the question for you to resign,
Marge. To even think of resigning.

262
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,635
You're a fine, wonderful
woman, and a great secretary.

263
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:56,316
That's the reason they want
you over with Staples.

264
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,658
He'll need someone like you as he's new.
They want him to get into harness fast.

265
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:03,005
Who can tell, Marge?
One of these days ..

266
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:06,171
That .. stomach of mine
is a pretty perverse organ.

267
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,320
And .. I'm tired.

268
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,331
You know, as it must to all men.

269
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,086
Mr Briggs.

270
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,957
Have you any idea who your successor is?

271
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,606
Yes. They chose Sylvia Trammel.

272
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:21,495
Miss Trammel?
- Hmm.

273
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,198
It is so ordained. So be it.

274
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,033
She's new, but supposed to
be very good at dictation.

275
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,240
We'll give her a chance to prove it.

276
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:30,793
Mr Briggs.

277
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,157
If I could only tell you what
this job has meant to me.

278
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:38,157
What working with you has meant to me ..

279
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:40,029
Alright, kid.

280
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,886
Wash up, get your money
and get out of here.

281
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,292
And give Mr Staples all the
best you've got in you.

282
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,536
I know you will.
That's the way you operate.

283
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,260
I like the guy.

284
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,531
I have a feeling he's going to
carve out a career around here.

285
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:57,292
Yes, sir.

286
00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:59,308
Everybody seems to think so.

287
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,289
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen.
Mr Ramsey will be with us in a moment.

288
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,873
Been away, have you?
- Good to see you.

289
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,809
Sorry, Fred. I was held up for a minute.

290
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,347
See you later, Fred.
- Where will we sit you?

291
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,100
Here's an empty chair.
You can sit right here.

292
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:42,310
Mr Staples, will you sit over there?
Right next to Mr Vandeventer.

293
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,875
One down from Mr Ramsey.

294
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,109
Welcome back, Bill. Feeling better?

295
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,189
Much, thanks. A little stomach upset.

296
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,069
Good .. I'm glad it's cleared up.

297
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:58,885
John, don't forget that contract.
Can we get it through tomorrow?

298
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:05,301
First gentlemen, I'd like you to look
over the mimeo'd sheet on top.

299
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:09,870
Haverford Mutual had doctors look
into the matter of executive diets.

300
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,140
Their findings showed
incredible deficiencies.

301
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,922
They've gotten up some food
tables. I'll have them mimeo'd.

302
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,775
I'd like you to look them over.

303
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,518
As you know, it's my feeling that a
healthy executive is an efficient one.

304
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:29,928
I think it not amiss now to introduce
the newest member of our team.

305
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,425
Mr Fred Staples.
He's from Mansfield, Ohio.

306
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:36,982
As you know, he was General Manager of
Queen Tool & Die until we took it over.

307
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:39,136
His record there was a brilliant one.

308
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,998
He's a production engineer by training.
An industrial relations man by instinct.

309
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,377
I expect good things from him.

310
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,954
You've probably met everyone, but ..

311
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:56,156
Just for the record,
reading from left to right.

312
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,395
Mr Jameson, Head of Purchasing.
- Yeah, we've met.

313
00:18:58,609 --> 00:18:59,824
Mr Grannigan, Controller.

314
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:01,889
Mr Gordon, Head of Sales.

315
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:03,926
Mr Latham, Head of Service.

316
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:05,734
Mr Portier, Chief of Operations.

317
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:07,449
How do you do.
- Nice to know you.

318
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,674
And Mr Vandeventer, Chief Engineer.

319
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,861
How are you? Nice to see you.
- Pleasure.

320
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,620
Of course you met Mr Briggs?

321
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,955
Yes.

322
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:18,146
He's Vice President and
Assistant General manager.

323
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,043
In charge of everything that everybody
else forgets to be in charge of.

324
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,506
Now gentlemen, you
all have before you a ..

325
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,246
Copy of the Williamstown
plant purchase prospectus.

326
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,569
Mr Jameson, did you attach a supplement?

327
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,114
It's right there, Mr Ramsey. Page 17R.

328
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:34,572
Under 'Process Equipment'.

329
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:38,489
Mr Grannigan, the stock purchase plan
I outlined. I have your comments here?

330
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:39,916
You do, Mr Ramsey.

331
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,489
Feasible, is it?
- Very much so, in my opinion.

332
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:45,303
Good.

333
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,076
Well.

334
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,565
That winds it up, unless there's
any further points to be made.

335
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,500
I think, Mr Ramsey, if we can keep
the transaction under wraps.

336
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,448
At least during the preliminaries.

337
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:59,243
You know what happens to stock quotes
if it leaks that we agreed the purchase.

338
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:00,935
I've arranged it this way.

339
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,629
The stock quotation as
of yesterday morning.

340
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:11,814
You seem to be straining at the
leash, Mr Briggs. Or am I mistaken?

341
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,551
You mention the likely time of
purchase is sometime in June.

342
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,939
The plant is to be in
receivership until then?

343
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:18,578
That's what it says.

344
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,066
That's six months with improper
maintenance of equipment.

345
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:22,483
I doubt it, Bill.

346
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,206
I've had two of my best men
out there for the last six weeks.

347
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:28,178
We had a varying voltage problem,
but that was taken care of.

348
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:32,185
No, maintenance-wise, I doubt if there
will be $1,000 worth of deterioration.

349
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,112
How about goodwill?
- What about it?

350
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,559
The plant employs 900 men.
Half the working force of the village.

351
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,776
So?

352
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:43,448
What do we do with these men? Put them
in a drawer until we resume production?

353
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,390
Your concern should be for the plant.

354
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,145
What good is a plant without men?

355
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,158
Chop a village payroll in half for six
months and you may not have a plant.

356
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,900
As you might not have a village.

357
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:56,449
Mr Briggs, let us to disregard for the
moment the considerations you mention.

358
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,723
What of the rest of the plan?

359
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,600
I'd say it was adequate.

360
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,428
Adequate?

361
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,747
That gentlemen, is the
kiss of death. Believe me.

362
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,376
I've known Mr Briggs for a long time.

363
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,364
When he says a thing is adequate, what
he means is, it is entirely <i>in</i>adequate.

364
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:17,460
I admit to feeling concern over 900 men
suddenly deprived of a livelihood.

365
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,168
Mr Briggs, do me the goodness ..

366
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:22,251
To look at what I consider to be a
fairly elementary business principle.

367
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,947
By putting 900 men out
of work temporarily.

368
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,759
We may ultimately employ twice
that number in the same town.

369
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:30,140
By cutting production costs as a result.

370
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,768
We will then be able to compete
more favorably in the market.

371
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:34,795
Thus we'll be able to sell more goods.

372
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,301
We're not ruining that town.
We're going to make it.

373
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,861
I should think Mr Briggs,
that after thirty years ..

374
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,381
You'd be able to think beyond
the tongue-clucking stage ..

375
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,904
And come up with a more
analytical point of view.

376
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:47,183
I thought I'd given you a point of view.

377
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:48,315
I saw none.

378
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,126
I've perceived what amounts
to an emotional little titbit.

379
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:53,563
That was decidedly more
charitable than corporative.

380
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:55,109
And not thought through.

381
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,802
I asked for an objective
view of a business venture.

382
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,517
From you I got and seem
constantly to be getting ..

383
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,663
A very negative response, if any at all.

384
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:04,432
'Adequate', I believe you said.

385
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,802
Mr Briggs. This move will save us
conservatively half a million dollars.

386
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,213
Which we'll be able to
put back into the business.

387
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:12,595
I must say you take a
liberal view of adequacy.

388
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,754
I didn't intend to make
an issue out of this.

389
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:17,267
But I felt it important enough
to air in this meeting.

390
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:23,318
You have aired it in this meeting.

391
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,345
I think it's a good thing you did.

392
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,474
But I think Bill, we're pretty
much of one mind about it now.

393
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:31,151
We may assume the matter is closed now?

394
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:33,558
Mr Briggs?

395
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,007
How about you, Mr Staples?

396
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:45,661
Do you have an opinion?

397
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:47,186
No.

398
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:50,243
I think not, Mr Ramsey.
- Why not?

399
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:53,936
Frankly, it's a little out of
my grasp at the moment.

400
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,178
I don't know anything
about the firm or its ..

401
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:58,925
Corporate set up.
Its reasons for bankruptcy.

402
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:01,224
Or for that matter, its product.

403
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:03,192
I'm afraid I'll have to pass.

404
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:05,780
Good answer.

405
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,595
I respect thoughtful
judgement, Mr Staples.

406
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:11,862
Congratulations.

407
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,146
We'll adjourn now until 2 o'clock.

408
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:20,708
I'm sorry we got started
so late this morning.

409
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:23,415
But I wanted this analysis
mimeo'd for your inspection.

410
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,508
After lunch, we'll take up the Portland
report which you have before you.

411
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:31,150
Mr Grannigan attended the stockholders
meeting there on Tuesday.

412
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:33,289
We'll begin our discussion
with his report.

413
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,403
That's all.
- Alright, sir.

414
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:39,198
Bill.

415
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:42,535
What about coming to have some lunch?
- No, thank you.

416
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:49,126
Bill, wasn't there something you
wanted to speak to me about before?

417
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:51,234
Nothing important.
- Fine.

418
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:54,421
Your tummy is alright, eh?
- Cast iron. Couldn't be better.

419
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,742
Good. Keep it up.

420
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,083
Staples.

421
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:01,143
See you later.
- You bet.

422
00:24:02,772 --> 00:24:04,600
Good to have you with us, Staples.
- Thanks.

423
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:06,525
The arrangements satisfactory?
- Yes.

424
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,329
Perfect. I'm sure you'll hear
from my wife about that.

425
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:10,834
It's a beautiful house.

426
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:13,128
Beautiful country up there.
I'm sure you'll love it.

427
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,184
See you later, Bill?

428
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:19,100
Oh Fred.

429
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,448
Briggs is working on a project now.
A comprehensive planning report.

430
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:25,521
The point is that it's very important.

431
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:27,800
Most important indeed
for our future program.

432
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,908
And it's <i>far</i> too big a job for Briggs.

433
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:31,715
Or for any one man to handle.

434
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,301
Now what I want you to
do is get your finger in.

435
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:35,350
Certainly.

436
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:37,635
What I mean is <i>more</i>
than just your finger in.

437
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:41,152
You understand?
- Yes, Mr Ramsey. You make that clear.

438
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,034
Can I see you a minute, Miss Fleming?

439
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:16,089
Yes, sir?

440
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:20,922
I wonder if you can check for me,
please, as to who's to be my secretary.

441
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:22,992
I need some notes typed up.

442
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,740
I'm to be your secretary, Mr Staples.

443
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,480
But I thought Mr Briggs ..

444
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,079
It was arranged for.

445
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:33,915
Just before the meeting, Mr Staples.

446
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,664
I take it you'd rather
remain with Mr Briggs?

447
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:41,621
I was Mr Briggs' secretary
for seven years, Mr Staples.

448
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:45,406
In that case I see no reason why I
shouldn't be able to get someone else.

449
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,123
It was Mr Ramsey's idea.

450
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:51,983
Do you want to give me those notes now?

451
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:56,275
No.

452
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,642
Why not have your lunch
first, Miss Fleming?

453
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:01,096
We'll take care of these
when you come back.

454
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,646
Mr Briggs.

455
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:20,999
There are some notes here.

456
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:22,669
Later, Marge.

457
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,749
I'll do it later.

458
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:07,645
Darling, you didn't say anything about
my new hairdo. Do you like it?

459
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:08,874
Yeah, it's lovely.

460
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:15,913
I wish you could see the new dresses
I bought. They're just beautiful.

461
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:17,591
Where are they?

462
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:20,454
Still at the store having little
things done to them.

463
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,833
Come to the kitchen, I'll make a drink.
- Not the kitchen.

464
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:25,597
The library.

465
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:37,819
I hoped they had the dresses ready.

466
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,107
I'd have them sent over to
your office this afternoon.

467
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:42,669
I spoke to your secretary
about it when I called.

468
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,332
It's funny. She didn't mention it.

469
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:47,498
They didn't get the job done in time.

470
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:49,871
She had a nice voice. What's she like?

471
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,770
Who?

472
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:53,439
Your secretary.

473
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:54,881
Oh ..

474
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,018
What you might expect.

475
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,512
You know.

476
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:01,737
What's her name?

477
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,101
Now to tell you the truth,
I didn't get her name.

478
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:06,598
Only her dimensions.

479
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,397
Ha. Alright.

480
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:12,014
No .. her name is 'Fleming'.

481
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:15,284
It so happens you've nothing
in the world to worry about.

482
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:16,998
She doesn't like me a bit.

483
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:18,981
Why?

484
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:23,579
I guess she prefers working
for her former boss.

485
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:26,687
Then why doesn't she?

486
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,075
I don't know. Some kind of ..

487
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:32,436
Strategy at the top, I guess.

488
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:35,670
Sounds funny.

489
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:37,240
Yeah.

490
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:42,198
Her ex-boss happens to be only
one of the Vice Presidents ..

491
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,555
My superior, and a
very nice guy to boot.

492
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,944
Could that perhaps be a good sign?

493
00:28:51,184 --> 00:28:53,264
You figure it out.
It left me a little up in the air.

494
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:57,084
You know Nancy, running a ..

495
00:28:57,815 --> 00:29:00,358
Plant in Ohio is beginning
to take on all the ..

496
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,017
Aspects of a ..

497
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:06,486
Nice simple uncomplicated gravy train.

498
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,061
What happened today?

499
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,309
Nothing really.

500
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:13,624
Just ..

501
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:15,985
An impression, I guess.

502
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:19,511
Sort of ..

503
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,058
Queer undercurrents.

504
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:23,509
Tensions.

505
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:28,878
Good luck.

506
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:56,978
Mr Ramsey.

507
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,100
Good morning, Mr Ramsey.
- Miss Stevens.

508
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:05,344
Fine. Thanks, Jerry.

509
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,268
Let me see that breakdown again.
- Sure.

510
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,372
Miss Fleming, step in here for a minute.

511
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:11,645
Yes, Mr Staples.

512
00:30:15,426 --> 00:30:16,898
That's not the one.
- Sorry.

513
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:18,156
Let me see to this.

514
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:20,354
Here it is. Yeah.

515
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:23,756
This is the only one I've cross indexed
for division, so don't let him keep it.

516
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,712
I want Billy to take my letter
from Henry Jacobsen with him.

517
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:27,721
Yes.

518
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,267
Now look, Billy.

519
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,777
Henry's a nice sincere guy, you know.

520
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,542
Made out of Bessemer steel.

521
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:37,112
He hasn't been off of his duff
since he learned to walk.

522
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:39,764
He started out stoking coke
furnaces when he was 14.

523
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,384
Was mill foreman at 20.

524
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,331
Ended up buying the whole plant
for his own 40th birthday present.

525
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:46,866
Know what I mean? Watch out.
- I will.

526
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,147
Give him that report.
Then remember what he says.

527
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,948
Make stenographic notes if you can.

528
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:53,377
If you can't, put it on paper
when you leave his office.

529
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:54,719
No approximations.

530
00:30:55,045 --> 00:30:56,576
Make it as ..
- Fred, I have to go.

531
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:59,809
I must know what they think and how they
feel about every paragraph they read.

532
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,649
I just hope they'll open up more
to you than they did to me.

533
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,024
I'll be down there sometime
next week for their decision.

534
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,394
Mention that to them.
- Yes. I will.

535
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:08,759
Hello?

536
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,353
Ah .. hold it please. Just a second.

537
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:14,029
Have a nice trip, Billy.
Be sure to call me Sunday night.

538
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,823
I will. Thanks very much.

539
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:17,013
Yes, put him on.

540
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,544
Don't go away, Miss Fleming.

541
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:20,004
Hello?

542
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:21,074
Judd.

543
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,106
Sorry. I meant to call you right back.

544
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,270
It's about that Atlantic States nitrate
meeting set up for October 3rd.

545
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:27,808
I'd like a delay on that.

546
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:33,479
I want to walk in there
sure of my ground and ..

547
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:35,880
October is not going to
give me any ground at all.

548
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,343
Yeah, could you do that?

549
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,860
That would be a help.

550
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:44,330
November 7th.

551
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:46,881
Fine.

552
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:49,799
Look, I'll see you in the dining room.

553
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:50,828
Okay, good.

554
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:53,492
Put that on my calendar please.

555
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:54,780
Now then ..

556
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,580
Did you get those wires off?
- Yes, sir.

557
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,913
After lunch I want you to
set up a conference call.

558
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:02,537
With Ramsey, Jameson, myself
and Frank Derring in Denver.

559
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,200
Got a minute, Fred? Sorry, Marge.
This is urgent.

560
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,586
It's about the NLRB vote in Portland.
- What about it?

561
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,081
Ramsey's grumbling about it.
He thinks it's premature.

562
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,456
Premature? What's he talking about?

563
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:16,219
He's had that plant running on
wishful thinking for 19 months now.

564
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:19,540
We've got a labor problem out there
all primed to explode in our faces.

565
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:23,243
Look Bill, you'd better walk into his
office with a great big neon sign:

566
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:24,501
'Strike'. You know.

567
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:26,411
Tell him I've an estimate worked out ..

568
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,889
That it will cost us, conservatively,
$4,000 a day if that plant goes out.

569
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,779
You know how that will hit him.
- Go in and dig up the ground.

570
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,500
I'll follow you with a bulldozer
and we'll plow him under.

571
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:39,189
We have 800 lumberjacks out there
and if they go it will do us big.

572
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:40,848
It won't be a one-week picket.

573
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:43,153
This could go on for a
year with no strain at all.

574
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:46,622
You walk in and set the charge.
I'll be in to light the fuse.

575
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:47,547
Fine.

576
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:49,109
I'll have to call you back.

577
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:57,595
Is 2:30 convenient for your
call to Denver, Mr Staples?

578
00:32:58,764 --> 00:32:59,681
Anything else?

579
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:01,781
I've a new problem here
if you have a minute.

580
00:33:02,478 --> 00:33:03,762
Paul. How are you, partner?

581
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:05,570
Mr Staples, that gun.

582
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:08,557
You got it. You like it? Try it out yet?
- Try it?

583
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:11,922
Thirty seconds after he saw 'Winchester'
on the box he was sighting it.

584
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,922
How about going for some skeet
shooting Sunday? Give it a try?

585
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:16,546
Wonderful. Can I Dad?

586
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,491
He's all yours, Fred.
He's a little too strenuous for me.

587
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:23,223
Mr Staples doesn't get tired like you.
- I don't get tired.

588
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,687
He was an All-American. It was just
terrific so stopped by and thank you.

589
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,460
Forget it.
- So long. See you outside.

590
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,910
Real thoughtful of you, Fred.
- My pleasure, Bill.

591
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:37,369
Hello, Mr Ramsey.

592
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,761
How are you, Paul?
Still taking vitamins, are you?

593
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:43,012
I guess so, sir.
- Fine. Keep it up.

594
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,416
Excuse me, Mr Briggs.

595
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,297
Man, I'm tired.

596
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:52,681
I've arranged for your call to Denver.
I must go over one paragraph.

597
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,571
I think I'll knock that off after
lunch if you don't mind.

598
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:57,286
Alright, Mr Staples.

599
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,050
No. Drink it here. Relax a minute.

600
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:03,357
Thank you.

601
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:05,612
I will.

602
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,300
Would you like some of mine?

603
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:28,259
Yes, thank you.
As a matter of fact, I would.

604
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:33,871
No, that's fine, thank you.

605
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,628
Where did you play your
football, Mr Staples?

606
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:45,240
Ohio State. But don't ask me the years.
I won't tell you.

607
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,836
I won't ask you.

608
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,444
Anyway, I feel about three times
older than when I first came here.

609
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:52,794
They've kept you busy?

610
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:54,724
Yes, they sure have.

611
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,441
You've done very well.
You've fitted in quickly.

612
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:03,083
Thank you.

613
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:09,520
You know, that's the first out-and-out
<i>friendly</i> thing you've said to me.

614
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:13,079
I think you resent me a little.
Don't you, Miss Fleming?

615
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,217
I don't know why you should ..
- It's just ..

616
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:17,492
A feeling I've gotten from time to time.

617
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,437
If you work with a man for
a long time, a fine man.

618
00:35:22,714 --> 00:35:25,075
You become part of him.
You identify yourself with him.

619
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:27,332
Then along comes a new man.

620
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:30,327
I like Bill Briggs. I like him a lot.

621
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,011
I have from the first.

622
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:36,231
If I have done or said anything ..
- No, no. Of course not.

623
00:35:37,993 --> 00:35:39,695
Because I must say
you've been very fair.

624
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,834
But seven years isn't a day.

625
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:47,464
I owe a lot to Mr Briggs.

626
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:53,682
Mr Briggs is the last of the original
bunch. Those who started this business.

627
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:56,376
It's not easy to be the last
of the original bunch.

628
00:35:58,121 --> 00:35:58,855
I know.

629
00:35:59,747 --> 00:36:01,508
He's not well. He has a bad heart.

630
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,306
And an ulcer.

631
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:08,216
I guess that's just about par for
the executive course, isn't it.

632
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,740
I guess I've always been a field man.

633
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,050
I haven't been an executive long
enough to find that out for myself.

634
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:15,838
You're a good one.

635
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:17,839
I think you're a very good executive.

636
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:20,625
You admit mistakes.

637
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:22,373
You don't pass the buck.

638
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,286
You're a lot like Mr Briggs that way.

639
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,077
I take that as a very nice compliment.
- I mean it.

640
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,473
Mr Briggs only trouble is that
he could never be a yes-man.

641
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,187
Not even to Mr Ramsey himself.

642
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:39,911
He always has to speak his mind.

643
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,094
You see Mr Ramsey .. doesn't
like his judgement questioned.

644
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,473
You either go along.

645
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:48,681
Or you get off.

646
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:50,991
Bill Briggs never got off.

647
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:53,205
No. He never did.

648
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,489
But maybe he's about to be pushed.

649
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,866
They drew up in the next round and then
Howard went by him with a 60-foot putt.

650
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:12,909
I ask you. 7 birdies. He sank an 80-foot
putt on the last hole for an eagle.

651
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:15,316
Hello, my dear.
You know, that's some golf.

652
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:19,125
Got everything you need?
- Yes, indeed.

653
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,825
That coffee will be ready
in just a little while.

654
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,015
Fine.

655
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,205
You know, my ..

656
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:42,404
My father's recipe for coffee ..

657
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,990
Was to mix salt and
chocolate with the grounds.

658
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:47,466
And cook them all up together.

659
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,020
He'd never drink anything else.

660
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:51,658
Sounds wonderful.

661
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:53,210
They ..

662
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,650
They serve it in a small downtown
restaurant I eat at occasionally.

663
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:59,620
I must remember to mention it to Fred.

664
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:03,451
You said he was a
confirmed coffee drinker?

665
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:06,017
Dedicated.
- Fine.

666
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:09,441
He's quite a young man,
this husband of yours.

667
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,633
Have you had a chance to
read much of the report?

668
00:38:12,943 --> 00:38:14,368
Of course it isn't finished yet.

669
00:38:14,653 --> 00:38:16,290
Thank you for letting me see this much.

670
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,281
Not according to the protocol,
I suppose, of a dinner party.

671
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,594
It makes me extremely
proud of my judgement.

672
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:25,707
I'm so happy.

673
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,619
He's been worried about it.

674
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:28,580
Nancy.

675
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:30,783
Would you excuse me?

676
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:39,272
A Wonderful party, you two.

677
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:41,125
Makes me think I should get married.

678
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,075
Don't do anything as drastic as that.

679
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,506
It was wonderful having you, Ed.
Come again soon.

680
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:46,906
Try keeping me away.

681
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,841
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.
- Yes. Bright and early. Goodnight.

682
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:52,451
Jamie, you don't have to go yet.
Stick around a while.

683
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,740
I'd like to stay all night. However ..

684
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,207
We're going home.
I can't get him out of here, Nancy.

685
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,191
At these office parties, eating
all the canapés is bad.

686
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,315
I thought everybody behaved well.

687
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:03,400
Is that so?

688
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:05,173
I give you credit for that.
- Night.

689
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,072
I was beginning to like all of them.

690
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:08,961
Will you come and see us?
- Sure.

691
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:10,530
During the day?
- Love to.

692
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:12,675
You know, holidays.
Jamie never gets home at all.

693
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,210
I think we wives should form a union.
- You're right.

694
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:17,094
Goodnight, dear.
- Bye-bye.

695
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,178
I wonder what happened
to Bill Briggs tonight.

696
00:39:27,136 --> 00:39:29,386
Darling, I forgot to tell you.
He phoned earlier.

697
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:31,967
He said he wanted to come
but he just wasn't up to it.

698
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,909
I wish you'd called me to the phone.

699
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,324
I wanted to talk to him anyway.
- Darling, you were busy.

700
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:37,664
I know, but I ..

701
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:41,962
What about Ramsey?
Is he planning to spend the night?

702
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:43,160
No.

703
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,497
He just gravitated towards the
library and made himself cozy.

704
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:50,110
That sounds a little like
<i>artificial</i> gravitation to me.

705
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:52,407
You didn't have anything to do with it?
- Well.

706
00:39:53,988 --> 00:39:55,729
He's really an amazing person.

707
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:59,026
You know, I expected
a real tycoon, but ..

708
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,354
He's so simple. Almost childlike.

709
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:05,494
Baby, I just hope by mistake
you never wander into a jungle.

710
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,153
Goodnight, Jeff.
- Goodnight. Wonderful time.

711
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:16,780
Most interesting reading
matter here, Fred.

712
00:40:17,854 --> 00:40:19,120
Very interesting reading.

713
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:23,828
I took the liberty of taking your wife's
invitation to look over your report.

714
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:26,021
Really?

715
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:27,663
Good, heady stuff.

716
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:29,420
Good solid thinking.

717
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:31,654
And some of it is better than good.

718
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,888
Of course. I can't say I agree
with all your conclusions, but ..

719
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:37,638
I listen to arguments.

720
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:40,219
It will be good to hear
arguments for a change.

721
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,076
<i>Good </i>arguments.

722
00:40:42,927 --> 00:40:45,997
I can't tell you what a relief that is.
We really sweated that one out.

723
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:48,103
Fred, I like a man to show initiative.

724
00:40:49,203 --> 00:40:51,613
I like a man who's not afraid
to think a new thought.

725
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,712
To take a different kind
of step on his own.

726
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,080
With your permission, I'll ..

727
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:59,069
Borrow this extra copy of
your report just overnight.

728
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,435
But for now, I can say ..

729
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:03,142
I'm very impressed.

730
00:41:04,973 --> 00:41:07,931
Of course we haven't finished it yet,
but Bill and I, after another week we ..

731
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:08,788
Bill?

732
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:11,530
You mean Briggs?

733
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:15,543
Yes, sir. We worked together on this.

734
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:17,448
Come now, Staples.

735
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,377
I pride myself on my sense for style.

736
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:24,762
I can link what I see with what I know
to be peculiar to a certain individual.

737
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:26,860
And I know Bill Briggs' work.

738
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:29,346
I've been exposed to it
since I was of voting age.

739
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:30,606
This ..

740
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:33,738
This isn't his style.
It isn't his brand of thinking.

741
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,106
I don't know what Nancy told
you, but Bill and I worked ..

742
00:41:37,406 --> 00:41:39,096
Fred. Learn to accept success.

743
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:42,656
It's tougher sometimes than
learning to accept failure.

744
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:45,630
Don't take half of your
accomplishment and ..

745
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:48,145
And hand it out gratuitously
to the man on your left.

746
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,276
Who hasn't the stuff
to do it on his own.

747
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:52,613
That is charitable. Humane.

748
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:54,854
It makes you feel good.
But it's <i>not</i> business.

749
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:56,690
Mr Ramsey, I want to clear up a point.

750
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:58,634
There will be a meeting
on Tuesday, Fred.

751
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:00,593
We can discuss the report then.

752
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:03,172
I assure you I don't
want any undue credit.

753
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:05,131
I never extend undue credit.

754
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:07,740
Ask anybody. Ask your friend, Briggs.

755
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:11,017
You think I'm tough on him, don't you.

756
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:14,465
I am tough on him.

757
00:42:18,357 --> 00:42:19,620
I think Bill is ..

758
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:22,500
I think he's a good man.

759
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:24,028
He was.

760
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:26,585
And grandfather clocks <i>were</i> good clocks.

761
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:28,677
Stanley Steamers <i>were</i> good automobiles.

762
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,810
But you can't run them
in competition today.

763
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:35,045
I must say that I like some
of his ideas very much.

764
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,907
Very much indeed.

765
00:42:37,363 --> 00:42:38,092
So do I.

766
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,142
Some of them.

767
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,758
Not many.

768
00:42:43,373 --> 00:42:44,446
Still, a man with ..

769
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,486
Bill's experience.

770
00:42:48,508 --> 00:42:50,357
I don't know.
I think he'd be hard to replace.

771
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:53,077
I'll see if the coffee's ready yet.
- Are you serious, Fred?

772
00:42:53,663 --> 00:42:55,079
Briggs would be hard to replace?

773
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,093
Do you honestly think that?

774
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:00,624
Why do you think I brought you down
here from Mansfield on short notice?

775
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,786
Do you think that was a whim?
Is that what you think?

776
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,671
Fred, you're Briggs' replacement.

777
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:08,933
I thought you understood that.

778
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:11,413
I'm ..

779
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:13,933
Expecting his resignation.

780
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:16,742
I don't like to prolong
these things. They are ..

781
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,944
Unpleasant and personal,
no matter what tack you use.

782
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,370
And under no circumstances
could I, or ..

783
00:43:25,042 --> 00:43:26,432
Would I undertake to fire him.

784
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:36,159
Coffee is in the living room.
Maybe you can go in there? It's quiet.

785
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:38,388
Look at the time. I really must go.

786
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:40,880
It's been a wonderful evening.

787
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:42,882
Sorry you have to leave so soon.

788
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:44,294
I really must.

789
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:48,199
My .. coat, I think is in the bedroom.

790
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:50,470
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you.

791
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:01,941
May I make a suggestion?

792
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,703
Mr Ramsey, I don't want
to seem ungrateful.

793
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,549
I'm not looking for gratitude.

794
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,313
You can't run a business
on thank-you notes.

795
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,180
That's Briggs' trouble.

796
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:15,382
And god forgive me, that
was my father's trouble too.

797
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:17,057
This.

798
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:22,599
The incredible conception of an industry
being run like a soup kitchen, like a ..

799
00:44:23,185 --> 00:44:24,754
Like a welfare comfort station.

800
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:28,642
I know what the old-timers think of me.

801
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:31,257
I've grown up getting stared at ..

802
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:34,345
By a lot of tongue-clucking
old fogeys who find me ruthless.

803
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:37,496
People who represent everything ..

804
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,837
That may have kept our business growing
to anything like its present size.

805
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:43,109
This.

806
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:47,115
This stupid black-and-white idea that
honesty and profit are incompatible.

807
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,859
I just happen to feel.

808
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,379
That the atmosphere
of a large corporation.

809
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:55,746
Cannot be constantly cathedral-like.

810
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,259
Thank you, Mrs Staples.

811
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:12,048
And .. again, thanks for
a wonderful evening.

812
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,177
I'll see you in the morning, Fred.

813
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,955
You didn't steal that promotion.

814
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,185
You won it.

815
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:28,412
Remember that.

816
00:45:34,757 --> 00:45:36,656
Goodnight, Mr Ramsey.
I hope you'll come again.

817
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,051
Thank you Nancy, and I hope
I'll be able to. Goodnight.

818
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:40,096
Goodnight.

819
00:45:53,275 --> 00:45:55,506
What .. what was <i>that</i> all about?

820
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,674
I'm Bill Briggs' replacement.

821
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:01,657
A Vice Presidency?

822
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:03,682
You must have really spread it on him.

823
00:46:05,034 --> 00:46:05,741
Listen.

824
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:08,250
A little rare roast beef and ..

825
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:11,514
Wifely pride don't get you
that kind of a promotion.

826
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:13,719
Yeah, it takes something a little more.

827
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,242
A little misrepresentation
for one thing.

828
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:19,512
A little switch in
authorship for another.

829
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,406
You told him <i>I'd</i> written that report.

830
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:23,486
I did not. I told him Bill helped you.

831
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:25,533
But Nancy, it's Bill's basic idea.

832
00:46:25,952 --> 00:46:28,850
The same set of ideas he's had
for years. I gathered that much.

833
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:31,528
You gave it life, made it work.
You made it practical.

834
00:46:31,742 --> 00:46:33,438
Even so, Nancy, I want no part of it.

835
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:35,747
Fred, I happen to know what
you contributed to this.

836
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,541
I also know that you
can't stand winning.

837
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:40,790
If you've a nodding
acquaintance with the loser.

838
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,128
I don't like stepping on another man
to get into a capital gains bracket.

839
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:46,205
Ramsey stalks the guy like an animal.

840
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,278
He'll whip him to death
to make him resign.

841
00:46:48,492 --> 00:46:50,345
I didn't hear you tell Ramsey
he was mistaken.

842
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:52,736
I didn't hear any clear-cut
defense of Mr Briggs.

843
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,793
If you don't want to be successful.

844
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:57,483
Tell it to Mr Ramsey.
- Nancy. Would you please ..

845
00:46:57,976 --> 00:46:59,793
You check in every night
but don't tell me ..

846
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:01,786
I don't want to argue about it.
- Nor do I.

847
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,531
I want you to answer me.

848
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:06,272
Did you tell him that
your wife was mistaken?

849
00:47:06,918 --> 00:47:09,650
Did you tell him you were taking
bows for something you didn't do?

850
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:16,841
No.

851
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,348
No, I didn't.

852
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,373
Why not, Fred?

853
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:26,029
Why not?

854
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,627
Because I wanted the job.

855
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:33,414
Thank you.

856
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:35,738
For a straight and honest answer.

857
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,429
Now I think we can both sleep tonight.

858
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:13,189
Hi.
- Good morning, Paul.

859
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,602
Where is Cora?
- She's late, I guess.

860
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,450
Aren't you going to be late for school?

861
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,094
It's only 8:10.

862
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,800
I've still got six minutes.

863
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,631
You have it figured out to
a science, haven't you.

864
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:32,322
I've got it figured to ..

865
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:33,726
How far I have to go.

866
00:48:34,095 --> 00:48:35,196
How long it takes me.

867
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:37,700
Well, if you found that out
you've found out a lot.

868
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:41,862
Thanks for breakfast.

869
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:45,361
You worked late again last night.

870
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:47,555
Yeah. No rest for the weary.

871
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,281
You haven't got it down to a
science yet, have you dad.

872
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:52,427
What?

873
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:54,803
How far you have to go and ..

874
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,704
How long it will take you.

875
00:48:58,837 --> 00:49:00,024
What's the matter, Paul?

876
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,439
Here. Here's last night's double-header.

877
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,007
The one we were going to see.

878
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:10,256
I forgot all about it, Paul. I'm ..

879
00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:11,852
I'm sorry.

880
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,963
We didn't miss much.
I watched it on television.

881
00:49:15,364 --> 00:49:18,297
A crummy double-header. The Braves
took both of them. You're lucky.

882
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,159
The Yanks are playing
tonight, aren't they?

883
00:49:21,373 --> 00:49:22,674
Yeah. They play the Red Sox.

884
00:49:23,206 --> 00:49:24,365
Let's start over again.

885
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:27,319
Meet me at the office. We have dinner.
Then go to the game together.

886
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,290
Sounds good.
- It's a date.

887
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:31,833
You're on.

888
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:33,963
So long, Dad. Have a good day and ..

889
00:49:35,115 --> 00:49:35,779
Uh ..

890
00:49:36,454 --> 00:49:37,784
If you can't make it tonight.

891
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:39,500
Would you give me a call at school?

892
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:42,247
I've raised the world's worst pessimist.

893
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:46,195
At eight in the morning you work out the
worst thing that could happen tonight.

894
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,668
Upstairs in my room, I've ..

895
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:51,759
I've got a drawer full of tickets
to ballgames we've never seen.

896
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:53,678
Because of that stuff.

897
00:49:54,537 --> 00:49:55,210
But ..

898
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:57,616
Call me if you can, Dad. It's important.

899
00:49:58,197 --> 00:49:59,500
I'll make it this time, son.

900
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:02,520
Can't you have a glass of milk and ..

901
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:04,757
Maybe tell me about last
night's double-header?

902
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:07,270
I'll be late. I wish I could.

903
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:09,756
So long, Dad. Take it easy.

904
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:11,049
Sure.

905
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:31,112
Good evening, Mr Staples.

906
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:32,398
Good evening, Sally.

907
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:47,606
Paul?

908
00:50:57,306 --> 00:50:58,064
Hi, Bill.

909
00:50:59,162 --> 00:50:59,966
Hi, Fred.

910
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:02,492
I thought it was my son.

911
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,316
He's going to pick me up.

912
00:51:06,016 --> 00:51:07,348
You got time for a cigarette?

913
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:09,788
Sure.

914
00:51:13,576 --> 00:51:16,250
What are you doing here?
I thought you went to the ballgame.

915
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:18,903
I've had a miserable
headache since dinner.

916
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:22,430
So I sent Paul on to see the game alone.

917
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:24,164
He's going to pick me up.

918
00:51:24,606 --> 00:51:25,907
How long have you been here?

919
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,845
A couple of hours, I guess.

920
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:33,498
Can I get you an aspirin or something?
- No .. no.

921
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:35,019
I'm much better now.

922
00:51:37,022 --> 00:51:37,825
Anyway.

923
00:51:38,272 --> 00:51:41,375
It gave me a chance to look over the
supplements you did for the report.

924
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:45,021
I think Ramsey's right, Fred.

925
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,995
You may be an engineer
by diploma, but you're ..

926
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:51,896
A crackerjack industrial planner
by instinct or something.

927
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:54,956
Coming from you, Bill,
that sounds real good.

928
00:51:55,499 --> 00:51:56,600
No question about it.

929
00:51:57,142 --> 00:51:58,994
Some of your suggestions
were great, Fred.

930
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:00,526
Really great.

931
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,724
I've incorporated them verbatim.

932
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:06,697
I like your approach, Fred.

933
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:10,145
You think of people in
terms of the human factor.

934
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:12,588
Not just logistically.

935
00:52:13,636 --> 00:52:16,385
Something I've never been able
to make Ramsey understand.

936
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,420
Anyway.

937
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:21,972
Now he can't complain I turn
in the same report every year.

938
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:24,776
He won't be able to say that this year.

939
00:52:28,216 --> 00:52:29,275
Join me, Fred?

940
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,261
No thanks, Bill. I've got to ..

941
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:34,359
Take Nancy out for supper and ..

942
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,921
That long drive home. You know.

943
00:52:41,085 --> 00:52:43,600
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just getting old.

944
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:46,171
I used to be pretty tough.

945
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,709
I'm still tough, I guess.

946
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,092
But every now and then I get .. tired.

947
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:58,218
Tired of arguments.

948
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:01,898
Tired of battling. Tired of the
whole bloody mess with all this ..

949
00:53:02,198 --> 00:53:04,486
Fancy organization as super-finagling.

950
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,242
I know it's legal and
modern and all that.

951
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:09,435
It's what they call a 'trend' isn't it?

952
00:53:09,975 --> 00:53:12,136
In the old days things
were a lot simpler.

953
00:53:13,368 --> 00:53:16,297
Businesses grow, Bill.
- This business didn't grow.

954
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,612
Not since old man Ramsey passed on.

955
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,163
It's been added to.

956
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,935
That's not growth.

957
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:26,408
Just plain acquisition of business
and stock transfers and bank loans.

958
00:53:26,965 --> 00:53:30,223
Manipulated by hired shysters
and a sharp-shooting accountant.

959
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,774
And organized and controlled by
a barracuda like Walter Ramsey.

960
00:53:36,977 --> 00:53:38,664
You sure you won't have a snifter, Fred?

961
00:53:40,037 --> 00:53:41,847
I wish you would.
- No.

962
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:47,680
Look, times change, Bill. You know that.

963
00:53:47,894 --> 00:53:49,667
But do they always
change for the better?

964
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:53,749
Old Ramsey could walk down a production
line and call any man by his first name.

965
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:56,304
And get called by his
first name in return.

966
00:53:56,572 --> 00:53:58,752
Yeah, I know that feeling. Believe me.

967
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:01,217
He didn't need public relations experts.

968
00:54:01,784 --> 00:54:03,708
Honor was enough. Character.

969
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:06,738
He never sold a share of
stock in this company either.

970
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:10,637
Not until the depression came along and
then he had to raise cash or go under.

971
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:12,015
Do you know why?

972
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:14,996
Because he would not
lay off one single man.

973
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:17,342
That's the kind of man Jim Ramsey was.

974
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:23,289
Now I sit in that fancy conference
room with Jim Ramsey's son.

975
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,871
I sit there and I see all
the old man's principles ..

976
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:29,861
All his beliefs.

977
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:32,194
Every single thing holy to him.

978
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:35,876
Jobbed off by this spindly
little financial wizard.

979
00:54:36,634 --> 00:54:38,774
This wall-eyed,
ice-coated little rooster.

980
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:41,280
Who knows more about debentures
than about the human heart.

981
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:42,640
Bill.
- I'm alright.

982
00:54:43,585 --> 00:54:45,005
Take it easy.
- I'm alright.

983
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,857
You're beginning to work yourself up.
- I'm alright.

984
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,091
Sit down, Fred.

985
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:57,840
Sit down quietly and be a nice,
sympathetic friend and associate.

986
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:04,098
I wonder if you're as good a human being
as you are an industrial relations man.

987
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:09,593
He doesn't like you, does he?

988
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,809
No.

989
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:14,132
Bill.

990
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:16,800
Has it ever occurred to you to resign?

991
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:20,035
Of course it has. A thousand times.

992
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:23,016
Why don't you?

993
00:55:24,117 --> 00:55:24,761
What?

994
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:27,029
Resign.

995
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,800
You can't take the chance
of letting this man fire you.

996
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:35,281
On our level you don't get fired.
You know that.

997
00:55:36,234 --> 00:55:37,811
After 30 years of productive work ..

998
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,349
They can't say to a man like me:
'Alright, now get out'.

999
00:55:41,154 --> 00:55:42,466
They just can't do that.

1000
00:55:43,562 --> 00:55:44,614
So what do they do?

1001
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:47,202
They create a situation.

1002
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:51,581
A situation you can't work in
and finally you can't live in.

1003
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,685
With this tension .. abuse.

1004
00:55:55,857 --> 00:55:57,385
Small humiliations.

1005
00:55:58,451 --> 00:56:02,110
It all starts out on a scale
so subtle, so microscopic.

1006
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:06,146
That at first you can't really
believe it's happening at all.

1007
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:09,813
Gradually, the thing
begins to take shape.

1008
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,230
Pieces fit together.
All the little bits.

1009
00:56:14,048 --> 00:56:15,389
It becomes unmistakable.

1010
00:56:16,691 --> 00:56:19,450
They chip away at your
pride, your security.

1011
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:22,991
Until you begin to have .. doubts.

1012
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:26,089
Then .. fears.

1013
00:56:28,007 --> 00:56:28,931
Ramsey.

1014
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,088
He wants me to resign.

1015
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:34,680
He wants me to get my craw so full, I'll
be miserable enough to do just that.

1016
00:56:35,056 --> 00:56:37,101
But you'd take it?
- Yes, I'd take it.

1017
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:38,141
Why?

1018
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:40,221
The bigger the job, the
more you must hang on.

1019
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:41,096
Why?

1020
00:56:42,188 --> 00:56:42,803
Why?

1021
00:56:43,017 --> 00:56:44,472
Why do you take it? Why not quit?

1022
00:56:45,766 --> 00:56:46,653
Quit?
- Yes.

1023
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:48,068
Get out of it. Chuck it.

1024
00:56:48,426 --> 00:56:50,497
You'd have your pension.
Your peace of mind.

1025
00:56:51,425 --> 00:56:52,014
No.

1026
00:56:52,431 --> 00:56:55,788
You know Ramsey is going to go on
hounding you until he makes you quit.

1027
00:56:56,173 --> 00:56:56,854
Never!

1028
00:56:57,938 --> 00:56:59,342
He'll <i>never </i>make me quit.

1029
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:05,580
Bill, I ..

1030
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:09,514
I wish I could understand
why you go on taking it.

1031
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,744
Because I'm weak, I guess.

1032
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:15,466
Because I'm sixty-two years old and
I don't think I could get another job.

1033
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,207
How does that strike you?

1034
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:18,902
How do you think?

1035
00:57:21,573 --> 00:57:23,458
Once in a while I have a dream.

1036
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:28,172
I dream I'm sitting in the conference
room and he starts working me over.

1037
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:30,600
I'm just smiling, see.

1038
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,256
I'm perfectly calm and I'm taking it.

1039
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:36,134
I don't show the slightest resentment.

1040
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,688
And then.

1041
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:41,866
Then without any change of
expression, I get up out of my chair.

1042
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:43,508
And walk over to him.

1043
00:57:44,188 --> 00:57:45,970
And I say: 'Ramsey'.
- Bill.

1044
00:57:46,555 --> 00:57:47,547
Ramsey.
- Bill.

1045
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:48,557
Ramsey.

1046
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:51,442
Then I smash him, and I smash him again.

1047
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,329
Get hold of yourself.
- I hit him again.

1048
00:57:53,592 --> 00:57:55,374
He starts to fall and I hold him up.

1049
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:56,421
Bill.

1050
00:57:56,826 --> 00:57:58,483
I say: 'I'm not through yet'.
- Bill.

It's the kid.

He's coming to pick me up.

1054
00:58:07,123 --> 00:58:09,481
Fred .. I don't want him
to see me. Not like this.

1055
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,519
You're alright, Bill. Just sit down now.
- No, he can't see me like this.

1056
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:15,812
Fred, help me, help me.
- Alright, I'll take care of him.

1057
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:18,320
Just lay low for a bit.
I'll see he gets home.

1058
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:20,042
Say I left early to get some milk.

1059
00:58:20,526 --> 00:58:22,012
Please, Fred. Hurry.

It's me, Paul.

1062
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:32,357
Hi, Mr Staples.

1063
00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:35,626
Man, what a place by night.

1064
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:38,510
Where do they keep the caskets?
- How you doing, partner?

1065
00:58:38,878 --> 00:58:40,609
Dad said I should drop
in and pick him up.

1066
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,482
He went on home.
He needed a little rest.

1067
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:45,749
Good.

1068
00:58:46,246 --> 00:58:47,748
He's under orders not to work late.

1069
00:58:48,493 --> 00:58:50,057
He can't seem to keep away lately.

1070
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:52,160
Always working, always worrying.

1071
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,724
No wonder he's Number 2 man.

1072
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:57,238
Suppose I drop you off
at Grand Central, huh?

1073
00:58:57,452 --> 00:58:58,707
Swell. Thanks, Mr Staples.

1074
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,567
Ever since I can remember he's
been married to this place.

1075
00:59:01,821 --> 00:59:03,221
Mom used to say the same thing.

1076
00:59:04,029 --> 00:59:06,604
They were great together,
Mr Staples. Mum and Dad.

1077
00:59:07,104 --> 00:59:09,351
They used to yell and
argue and carry on.

1078
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:10,854
He was a fighter.

1079
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:23,863
Thank you, Mark.

There's another bundle on the truck.

1082
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:01,001
Mr Staples. You left your
hat in Mr Briggs' office.

1083
01:00:01,215 --> 01:00:04,355
Fred, I've the Stanley contract made up.
- Later, please.

1084
01:00:05,944 --> 01:00:06,944
A bad night.

1085
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,675
Yes, Mr Staples?

1086
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:17,073
This is the proposals report.

1087
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:20,050
Give that to Miss Lanier for
confidential mimeo-ing.

1088

Tell her Mr Briggs has the only carbon.
Is he in yet?

01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:24,073
No, sir.

- Yes?

01:00:26,063 --> 01:00:27,048
It's not signed.

1092
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:30,320
How would you like the
names? In what order?

1093
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:34,306
First yours, or first Mr Briggs?
- I don't care. It makes no difference.

1094
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,813
But a joint project, sir?

1095
01:00:36,027 --> 01:00:39,615
I really don't think it's too important.
Put Mr Briggs name first if you like.

1096
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,193
Just give it to Miss Lanier, right away.

1097

Marge, what is it?

1100
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:08,603
Proposals report.
Can you sign it so it can be printed?

01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:09,760
Would you ..

One moment please.

1103
01:01:12,825 --> 01:01:15,218
Marge, please take it in to Mr Ramsey.
He asked to see it first.

1104
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:16,586
Hello?

01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:18,597
Yes. Good morning.

01:01:19,681 --> 01:01:21,097
Is that the report?
- Yes, sir.

1107
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:23,417
Miss Lanier said you wanted to see it.
- Yes, I do.

1108

Who signed this?

1109
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:27,879
I wrote the title page.
Mr Staples suggested I sign it.

1110
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:33,529
Print it.

1111
01:01:33,743 --> 01:01:36,034
I'm sure if Mr Staples knew ..
- Print it, Miss Fleming.

We meet with Ramsey in 20 minutes.

1114
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:57,876
Under the conditions and time we
have it's the best plan I can devise.

1115
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:00,487
It's the only one ready so you
fellows have to go along.

1116
01:02:01,226 --> 01:02:03,454
Marge. I can sign that report now.

1117
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,686
Thank you, Marge.

The major projects during
the period mentioned.

1119
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:25,881
Being the Huber Petroleum Refinery.

1120
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,458
The Sterling Carstairs Refinery.
The Chatham Nichols Smelter Company.

1121
01:02:29,972 --> 01:02:32,593
The Henderson Valley Dam.
The Swincarbon Steam Plant.

1122
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,359
And the New England Canadian
natural gas pipeline.

1123
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,439
A good report, Van.

1124
01:02:38,076 --> 01:02:40,205
I get a real feeling of
activity doing your reading.

1125
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,105
The next item of business is
the projects proposal report.

1126
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:49,881
Clearly, the greatest single
importance on our docket this morning.

1127
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:52,012
I must say, and I'm sure you agree ..

1128
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,933
That I'm not given to enthusiasms
at the drop of a submission.

1129
01:02:55,924 --> 01:02:59,424
But of this, I'm impelled to say it is
unique in effort, genius and thought.

1130
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,517
To Mr Staples of our organization goes
my heartfelt thanks and congratulations.

1131
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:08,792
Besides being our newest member,
he is shaping up as our most astute.

1132
01:03:09,547 --> 01:03:13,266
This set of proposals is ingenious
comprehensive and fresh.

1133
01:03:13,821 --> 01:03:14,779
Congratulations.

1134
01:03:15,467 --> 01:03:17,941
Your success reaffirms my own judgement.
- Mr Ramsey.

1135
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:20,091
My own <i>good</i> judgement, I add.
- Mr Ramsey.

1136
01:03:20,428 --> 01:03:23,230
I prefer not to be drenched in modesty.
- This is not modesty.

1137
01:03:23,627 --> 01:03:25,711
Just the extension of
credit where it's due.

1138
01:03:26,305 --> 01:03:27,648
Bill is as responsible ..

1139
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:29,879
Is your name about to be used in vain?

1140
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:32,553
I don't think Fred would
use my name in vain.

1141
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:35,925
It is refreshing to find someone
not suffering from over-modesty.

1142
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:39,318
What I was trying to say is that we
worked on this project together.

1143
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:40,869
It was a combined effort.

1144
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:42,053
I'm sure it was.

1145
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,198
As long as that's understood.

1146
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,441
It is. It is. It's just that I feel ..

1147
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,304
Reasonably competent to assess
individual performances.

1148
01:03:49,727 --> 01:03:52,622
And to single out those I
feel should be singled out.

1149
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:56,622
With all due regard for Mr Staples'
concern for his fellow man.

1150
01:03:59,078 --> 01:04:01,995
Now then, if Mr Briggs' ego
has been sufficiently nourished ..

1151
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:04,320
I don't think Fred brought
this up to feed my ego.

1152
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,924
Then whatever it was that prompted
his precipitate dash to your defense.

1153
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,044
There was no dash to my defense.
- Why not drop the thing, Mr Briggs?

1154
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:14,340
I hate becoming entangled in
absurd personality conflicts.

1155
01:04:14,702 --> 01:04:17,223
I'll put a star by your name on the
cover if that makes you happy.

1156
01:04:17,573 --> 01:04:19,593
My name is no longer on the cover.
- Mr Briggs.

1157
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:23,103
You twist the thing to make it
seem I'm grubbing for recognition.

1158
01:04:23,423 --> 01:04:24,210
Mr Briggs.

1159
01:04:24,525 --> 01:04:25,843
I find it unfair, Mr Ramsey.

1160
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:27,300
We have a full agenda.

1161
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,190
If you feel so bruised to persist
in prolonging this discussion.

1162
01:04:31,604 --> 01:04:34,416
Mr Ramsey.
Let me finish Mr Staples, if I may.

1163
01:04:35,095 --> 01:04:37,309
We have only one purpose here. To work.

1164
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,488
We cannot hope to accomplish this if we
must be continually subjected to the ..

1165
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:44,073
To these singularly unbecoming
strains and tensions.

1166
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,258
These childish claims
and counter-claims.

1167
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,576
Mr Briggs, I asked
you a simple question.

1168
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:53,730
Is it or is it not within my province to
credit a man with a job well done?

1169
01:04:54,045 --> 01:04:55,880
Of course it is.
- Then may we drop it now?

1170
01:04:56,366 --> 01:05:00,404
If it's understood that I don't submit
to any discolorations of a man's worth.

1171
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:04,236
As to a man's worth, Mr Briggs.
I have proven to be a competent judge.

1172
01:05:05,053 --> 01:05:08,727
I ask you to recall I built the business
from a scratch-pile of used lumber ..

1173
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:10,693
And a few machines into a giant.

1174
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,572
I made few mistakes in doing it.

1175
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:15,211
Few mistakes in business and
few mistakes in judging men.

1176
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:18,634
You made one here. This report.
- I won't engage in a running fight.

1177
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,247
Because a supposedly responsible
official of this company ..

1178
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,750
Persists in wasting time
haggling over credit.

1179
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:26,201
That's not fair.
- I was not haggling over credit.

1180
01:05:26,704 --> 01:05:28,235
This is a joint report we worked on.

1181
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:30,365
Don't tell me what is true
and what is not true.

1182
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:33,663
What am I, some kind of idiot? That I
can't recognize another man's thinking?

1183
01:05:34,074 --> 01:05:35,948
Whatever your abilities
in the past, Mr Briggs.

1184
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:39,447
Your work hasn't shown this stamp of
originality and talent in ten years.

1185
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,016
A man slips, clutches.
He loses his grip.

1186
01:05:43,383 --> 01:05:45,049
He tries to hang on by someone else's.

1187
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,106
You've no right to say that.

1188
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:49,600
Bill, will you please speak up?

1189
01:05:51,154 --> 01:05:52,533
Do by all means, Mr Briggs.

1190
01:05:53,756 --> 01:05:55,144
You think I'm mistaken, do you?

1191
01:05:56,237 --> 01:05:57,840
Can I go through 150 pages ..

1192
01:05:58,156 --> 01:06:01,243
And point out to you line by line, where
another man has taken over for you?

1193
01:06:01,585 --> 01:06:02,869
<i>Had</i> to take over for you.

1194
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:05,553
I can point out sections of this
report I never had to touch.

1195
01:06:05,852 --> 01:06:07,689
Had to, Mr Staples? Of course you can.

1196
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:11,269
Let me show them to you. I've seen
them submitted, year after year.

1197
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,288
'Principles and precepts
for better business'.

1198
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:16,691
Mr Briggs' yearly platitudes.

1199
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:20,226
But you translated his unworkable
well-intentioned philosophy.

1200
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,123
Into tough business procedures.

1201
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:23,710
You make it work.

1202
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:24,648
Ramsey.

1203
01:06:25,018 --> 01:06:28,008
Mr Briggs, I will not tolerate
insubordination on any level.

1204
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:30,100
If anyone here finds that intolerable ..

1205
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:32,815
He has the God-given right
to offer his resignation.

1206
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:46,345
Bill.

1207
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:48,885
Please.

1208
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:52,603
Mister Ramsey.

1209
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:57,349
I had no intention of
seeming insubordinate.

1210
01:07:14,229 --> 01:07:15,364
Meeting is adjourned.

1211
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:28,273
Mr Briggs.

1212
01:07:33,254 --> 01:07:34,043
Mr Briggs.

1213
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:38,131
Miss Lanier. Miss Lanier.

1214
01:07:38,382 --> 01:07:39,026
Bill.

1215
01:07:40,077 --> 01:07:41,228
Bill, can you hear me?

1216
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:42,556
A little ..

1217
01:07:43,205 --> 01:07:44,831
A little .. bottle of pills.

1218
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:47,443
In my coat .. in the office.

1219
01:07:47,936 --> 01:07:49,241
Get some water.
- Yes, sir.

1220
01:07:49,821 --> 01:07:52,175
Grannigan, get an ambulance.
Call Dr Fletcher.

1221
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:53,584
Don't move him.

1222
01:07:54,243 --> 01:07:54,919
Fred.

1223
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,900
Bill .. still giving .. audits.

1224
01:08:00,094 --> 01:08:01,488
Do me a favor, Fred.

1225
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:02,769
What, Bill?

1226
01:08:03,342 --> 01:08:04,264
Tell him ..

1227
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:06,056
Tell him ..

1228
01:08:06,769 --> 01:08:07,610
Go to ..

1229
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:22,443
[ Telephone ]

1230
01:08:27,058 --> 01:08:27,873
Hello?

1231
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,410
Thank you, Mr Staples.

1232
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,857
Five minutes ago.

1233
01:08:55,809 --> 01:08:57,310
We just had word from the hospital.

1234
01:08:58,472 --> 01:08:59,963
He died five minutes ago.

1235
01:09:01,675 --> 01:09:02,862
Thank you, Mr Grannigan.

1236
01:10:59,828 --> 01:11:00,500
Nancy?

1237
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:02,494
What are you doing here?

1238
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:04,049
I called your office.

1239
01:11:05,059 --> 01:11:07,003
There wasn't any train so I drove here.

1240
01:11:10,394 --> 01:11:11,869
How did you know where to find me?

1241
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:14,183
They told me at the hospital.

1242
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,524
Does Paul know?

1243
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:23,095
Yes, he's with ..

1244
01:11:23,606 --> 01:11:24,907
Bill's sister. He's alright.

1245
01:11:25,743 --> 01:11:27,073
You care for something, Miss?

1246
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,453
Have you had anything to eat?

1247
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,143
Huh?

1248
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:36,156
Have you <i>eaten</i> anything?

1249
01:11:41,753 --> 01:11:42,478
Fred.

1250
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:45,106
What happened?

1251
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:47,688
Nothing.

1252
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,429
Not a thing.

1253
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,016
Except a murder.

1254
01:11:54,938 --> 01:11:56,674
There were witnesses too. Plenty of us.

1255
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:01,352
And no-one lifted a finger to stop it.
- Fred.

1256
01:12:01,758 --> 01:12:04,442
Nancy, I know. I didn't lift a finger.
- You <i>don't </i>know.

1257
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,850
I'll not have you going around
in sackcloth and ashes ..

1258
01:12:08,201 --> 01:12:10,543
For something you did all
in your power to stop.

1259
01:12:11,322 --> 01:12:13,335
You begged him to resign. You know that.

1260
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:15,231
What more could you have done?

1261
01:12:15,513 --> 01:12:16,960
What more could anyone have done?

1262
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:19,163
Nancy, I think you had better go home.

1263
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:20,932
Would you check this please?

1264
01:12:21,748 --> 01:12:23,150
Are you coming?
- Nope.

1265
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:25,402
Then I won't go.

1266
01:12:25,745 --> 01:12:27,685
I want you to go home and start packing.

1267
01:12:29,419 --> 01:12:30,553
Where are we going?

1268
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:33,279
I don't know. Somewhere. Anywhere.

1269
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:35,578
Just away.

1270
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:39,253
There's an awful stink in this town
and we're going to get away from it.

1271
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:44,794
Come on, I'll put you in the car.
- No, I'm not leaving you alone.

1272
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:48,129
Nancy, I want you to go home.
- No, I'm not going tonight.

1273
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:49,945
Tomorrow, I'll do what you ask.

1274
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,130
I'll pack or go anywhere.
But not now. Not in the state you're in.

1275
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,638
Look. There's something I must do.
- Fine.

1276
01:12:56,329 --> 01:12:57,573
Then we'll do it together.

1277
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:47,858
Bill was meant to go to Lansing tomorrow
morning for a meeting with Phillips.

1278
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:50,060
You'll have to take his place.

1279
01:13:50,832 --> 01:13:52,419
I believe I've already mentioned that.

1280
01:13:52,856 --> 01:13:54,014
Yeah. You mentioned it.

1281
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:01,669
You'll leave on flight number 116.

1282
01:14:01,883 --> 01:14:03,160
8:32 from LaGuardia.

1283
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:07,199
Miss Lanier will meet you at the
airport with your reservation ..

1284
01:14:07,413 --> 01:14:10,395
And all memoranda and correspondence
pertaining to the negotiations.

1285
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:13,124
You have three uninterrupted
hours in the air ..

1286
01:14:13,338 --> 01:14:15,154
To familiarize yourself
with all the details.

1287
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:18,996
I have no interest whatever
in the Phillips matter.

1288
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:20,856
What was that?

1289
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,288
I'm telling you I don't want the job.
I'm through.

1290
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:26,030
I'm quitting. I resign as of now.

1291
01:14:26,354 --> 01:14:26,969
Why?

1292
01:14:27,183 --> 01:14:28,838
Because I hate your guts.

1293
01:14:29,616 --> 01:14:31,661
You used Bill Briggs for a whipping boy.

1294
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:34,334
You made him knuckle under
and then you beat him to death.

1295
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:37,479
You wouldn't try anything like that
with me because I'd kill you first.

1296
01:14:38,218 --> 01:14:40,019
I'm not a nice human being. What else?

1297
01:14:40,269 --> 01:14:41,545
You're nothing but a freak.

1298
01:14:41,883 --> 01:14:44,373
You'll drive your people in to peak
efficiency if they can make it.

1299
01:14:44,587 --> 01:14:45,816
Or a grave if they can't.

1300
01:14:46,468 --> 01:14:48,989
Because Bill lacked the strength ..
- And the capacity.

1301
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:50,741
He was second in command.

1302
01:14:51,081 --> 01:14:52,930
He had responsibility to
hold and he cracked.

1303
01:14:53,144 --> 01:14:55,726
It was <i>his</i> business too.
- It's no-one's business.

1304
01:14:56,145 --> 01:14:57,446
It belongs only to the best.

1305
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:00,885
To those who can control it, sustain it,
nurture it, keep it growing.

1306
01:15:01,694 --> 01:15:03,885
Right now it belongs to us
because we're producing.

1307
01:15:04,347 --> 01:15:06,578
But in the future it belongs
to whoever has the brains ..

1308
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:08,594
The nerve and skill to take it from us.

1309
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:11,478
They can have my share right
now as I don't want any part of it.

1310
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:13,460
What do you want from me, apologies?

1311
01:15:14,151 --> 01:15:15,418
I don't apologize.

1312
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:17,859
What else?

1313
01:15:19,287 --> 01:15:21,024
A nice, unsullied conscience?

1314
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:24,875
Do you walk out of there with a
halo because you spoke your mind?

1315
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:26,811
What do you do then?

1316
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:30,543
Go to work for some nickel and
dime outfit run by 'nice' people?

1317
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:32,997
Who won't challenge you
and prod you and goad you.

1318
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:35,435
And drive you to a height
you never even dreamed of.

1319
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:38,630
A company where there is nothing
to fight for, because you are the best.

1320
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,265
Where there is no competition.

1321
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:44,567
Where everything is handed to you.
And nothing is worth fighting for.

1322
01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:46,709
I want you to stay.

1323
01:15:48,589 --> 01:15:50,508
I don't think you understand, Ramsey.

1324
01:15:51,274 --> 01:15:53,971
I don't like you.
I don't like anything about you.

1325
01:15:54,185 --> 01:15:55,648
I didn't hire you to like me.

1326
01:15:56,168 --> 01:15:58,452
Alright. I'm not a nice
person in your eyes.

1327
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,907
But whatever I am, you'll learn
more, grow more and do more ..

1328
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:03,854
Here with me than
anywhere else on earth.

1329
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,188
I want you to stay because
I need help on my level.

1330
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:09,702
And you're the only one
who's able to function there.

1331
01:16:10,347 --> 01:16:13,114
Be a conscience for me if you want.
Be anything you like.

1332
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:16,245
If it's something I don't like,
you'll know about it soon enough.

1333
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,786
I think you're strong enough to take it.

1334
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:21,239
And if not, I think you're
strong enough to get out.

1335
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,441
Name your terms.

1336
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,058
All terms are negotiable.

1337
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:27,645
I don't think so.

1338
01:16:28,225 --> 01:16:29,030
Not mine.

1339
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:30,220
Alright.

1340
01:16:30,936 --> 01:16:32,960
I'd just as soon not waste
any time doing trading.

1341
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:35,846
As of now, your salary is doubled.

1342
01:16:37,242 --> 01:16:39,173
Your stock option is doubled
right down the line.

1343
01:16:40,685 --> 01:16:42,502
Your expense account is
whatever you make it.

1344
01:16:42,956 --> 01:16:44,854
Add to that a new title: Vice President.

1345
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,960
I want a lot more than that.

1346
01:16:50,862 --> 01:16:54,398
You're not taking me on as just another
Vice President you can just push around.

1347
01:16:55,613 --> 01:16:58,877
You'll take me as someone who
hates you down to the bare nerves.

1348
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:00,850
Nothing in the world
will ever change that.

1349
01:17:01,394 --> 01:17:05,278
I'll argue with you, contradict you,
fight you in every way I know how.

1350
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,329
I'll do everything in my power to push
you out and take your place myself.

1351
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:10,994
Go ahead and try.

1352
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:13,408
Mr Staples.

1353
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:15,422
You have yourself a deal.

1354
01:17:16,348 --> 01:17:17,334
Have it drawn up.

1355
01:17:18,452 --> 01:17:20,076
No reservations now?

1356
01:17:23,366 --> 01:17:24,299
Yes. One.

1357
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:27,479
Bill had one pitiful little dream.

1358
01:17:27,693 --> 01:17:30,012
That someday he'd walk in
here and break your jaw.

1359
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,799
I reserve the right to
have that wish for myself.

1360
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,908
I'll have it drawn in the contract.

1361
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:39,652
With a little rider giving
me the same privilege.

1362
01:17:50,113 --> 01:17:50,842
Staples.

1363
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:54,520
You'll be pleased to know that Bill
Briggs' boy is being taken care of.

1364
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:00,369
That lets you sleep better tonight.

1365
01:18:02,381 --> 01:18:03,356
It begins, huh?

1366
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:06,618
It begins .. fair enough?

1367
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:09,069
Fair enough.

1368
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:50,302
Do we pack?

1369
01:18:52,404 --> 01:18:54,155
No .. we stay.

1370
01:18:55,545 --> 01:18:57,417
On whose terms?
- Mine.

1371
01:18:59,167 --> 01:18:59,896
And his.

1372
01:19:01,284 --> 01:19:02,918
Are you satisfied?
- Yes.

1373
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:05,035
Fred.

1374
01:19:05,362 --> 01:19:08,706
You know it's easy enough to chuck
something you think is wrong.

1375
01:19:10,032 --> 01:19:11,878
I don't know. This way
maybe there's a chance.

1376
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,140
I'm so happy.

1377
01:19:13,948 --> 01:19:14,785
We'll see.

1378
01:19:16,247 --> 01:19:17,522
I've got to go to Lansing.

1379
01:19:18,235 --> 01:19:19,250
The morning plane.

1380
01:19:19,624 --> 01:19:21,743
When will you be back?
- Tomorrow night.

1381
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:23,971
I'll be late.

1382
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:27,094
Aren't you always?

1383
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,956
..t-g..
