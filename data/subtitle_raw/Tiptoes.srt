1
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,239
- Nice.
- Thanks.

2
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,385
I don't know how
you work this way.

3
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,510
It relaxes me.

4
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,554
Here.

5
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,024
- Let me fix your tie.
- Try not to get paint on me.

6
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,321
Relax, okay?

7
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,366
What are you gonna do tonight?
Just gonna hang out?

8
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,797
- Like you really care.
- Don't start with me.

9
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,402
I'm not. You are.

10
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,771
And I told you about this
weeks ago. Remember?

11
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,714
- What?
- What?

12
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,579
You got a little something going
on the side, Steven?

13
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,386
You can tell me.

14
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,084
I got something on the side called
family and I can't get out of it.

15
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,717
How many times
you wanna hear that?

16
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,122
What? Your family
fucked-up or something?

17
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,762
- Is that why you're being so secretive?
- Hey, I need you to trust me, okay?

18
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,802
- Do not get paint on me.
- Okay.

19
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,037
Sweetie?

20
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,148
I've gotta get going. Now.

21
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,546
What, right this second?

22
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:37,079
- Yes. Right this second.
- Okay. You know what? Fine.

23
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,521
Have yourself a real ball.

24
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,124
Get out of here.

25
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,596
You're a wonderfully cruel woman.

26
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,332
I'm gonna wake you up.

27
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,744
I can't even take a piss straight.
I'm vibrating to fucking death here.

28
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,325
Shut up, Rolfe. You drive me crazy.

29
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,038
You diminutive French snail.

30
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:37,572
You know, Maurice, you're the one
who said we could do it in eight hours.

31
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:43,484
- I could've walked faster!
- It's your problem for going so slow.

32
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,147
We need to cool.

33
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,124
Come on! You bastard.

34
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,787
What are we stopping for?

35
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,424
Go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

36
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,581
- Breaking ground on
a new, historical museum.

37
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,986
Steven. Good to see you.

38
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,122
Jerry Robin, Jr.

39
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,159
I have known so many
little people professionally.

40
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,406
But what I didn't know is
there are over 100,000...

41
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,737
...little people in
North America alone.

42
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,111
- Hey, Mom.
- Well, if it isn't Mr. Late.

43
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,311
I'm not that late.

44
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,288
- Hello, Steven. Where's your brother?
- He's not here?

45
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,360
I can't believe he'd be late to a
convention. Something's wrong.

46
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,555
- There's nothing wrong.
- How you doing, girls?

47
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,566
Your favorite, dear. Egg salad.

48
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:40,105
Now, let's cut that rug.
Courtesy of The Lobsters.

49
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,039
Hey, everybody. Hello, girls.
How you doing tonight, Steven?

50
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,242
Doing the best I can.
How about yourself?

51
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,215
Doing all right, thank you.

52
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,517
Hey, Bobby. Do you see this
blond coming up here?

53
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,785
Oh, yeah.

54
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:06,496
She's been asking us to introduce
you to her since last convention.

55
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,657
- No kidding?
- She's an ice skater...

56
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,799
...in one of those shows,
Holiday on Ice. Kitty.

57
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,131
Bobby, say hello to the indomitable
Miss Kitty Katz.

58
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,202
- Well, hello, Mr. President.
- The pleasure's mine.

59
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,470
See her tits?

60
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,379
- Hello, ladies.
- My daughters.

61
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,551
Hi.

62
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,680
Why don't you girls go out and
dance and have some fun.

63
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,118
Yeah, girls. You ready?

64
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:38,093
Let's go cut a rug. You too.

65
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,564
Come on, now.

66
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,642
I could use a good, stiff one.
Oh, I mean a cocktail.

67
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,399
- Hey, Steven! Over here!
- Hey, Rolfe!

68
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,201
Rolfie! My friend, you are
in the doghouse.

69
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,275
Mom and Pop are pissed.

70
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,207
That's great. Steven, this is Maurice.
Maurice is an asshole.

71
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:32,113
Hey, the asshole is the strongest
muscle in the human body.

72
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,310
Do you think there's any food left?

73
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,422
Man, I really couldn't tell you.

74
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,786
- My name's Lucy.
- Hi, Lucy.

75
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,457
Hey, don't go ripping off food, now.

76
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,689
You can't steal food.
Food's from God. It's plentiful.

77
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,126
- God wants me to eat.
- Come on, Lucy. Let's go.

78
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,695
What's going on? You wanna
go grab a drink somewhere?

79
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,033
No, I'm kind of tired.
What about tomorrow?

80
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,078
I can't tomorrow. Tonight's
my last night. I got a class.

81
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,512
I gotta put through finals all week.

82
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,383
What's the story anyway, man?

83
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,455
The hell happened? Where you been?

84
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,490
That's what happened.

85
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,717
What do you mean,
"That's what happened"?

86
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,625
You drove this thing 400 miles?

87
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,027
Yeah, well, Maurice builds
them and...

88
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,994
...I can't afford to fit out a car
right now, so...

89
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,266
...I figured what the hell. Hey,
you laugh, man, it got me here.

90
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,771
Call Mom and Dad.
Let them know you're all right.

91
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,739
Don't let them know you're riding
around on this thing.

92
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,446
Yeah, well, don't you
go telling them either.

93
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,742
Don't I go telling them?

94
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,713
Assholes! All of you!
Fucking assholes!

95
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,122
Where you staying tonight?

96
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:50,786
We'll go find a cheap motel and
then I'm gonna give Sally a holler.

97
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,328
- Sack over there for a few nights.
- Might as well get used to it.

98
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,766
You two are gonna end up together,
no matter what happens.

99
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,404
They alleged that we
were stealing food.

100
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,345
- It's good to see you, man.
- Yeah.

101
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,178
You can try and make it sooner
next time. We can shake it up a little.

102
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,580
I know. Well, next year.

103
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,148
Have a good time with Sally, buddy.
You know where to find me.

104
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,454
Be careful, buddy.

105
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,064
So did you have a good time?

106
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:12,041
- Was it everything you expected?
- It was okay.

107
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,203
Whatever it was.

108
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,776
Steven?

109
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,589
I don't want us keeping
secrets from each other.

110
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:28,456
- It's too late to start obsessing, okay?
- You're the one making it happen.

111
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:33,122
- Why don't you just let it go, okay?
- I can't.

112
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:38,362
You're playing me. I know it.
I just can't figure out why.

113
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,174
You do not think that
I'm seeing someone.

114
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,404
No, of course not.

115
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,376
You know how we're always
talking about our future...

116
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,388
...what we're gonna do, where we're
gonna live and all that other stuff?

117
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:03,359
- Can we talk about this later?
- No, we need to talk, Steven.

118
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,691
- Right now?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,503
Carol, all right.

120
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,478
This better not be an all-night
marathon or I'll kill you.

121
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,139
- No, it won't. I promise.
- All right. What do you got, babe?

122
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,083
I think maybe I'm pregnant.

123
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,802
Oh, man.

124
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,310
We've been using protection.

125
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,677
Except for those two
or three times a week...

126
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,410
...when you wake me up
in the middle of the night.

127
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,611
Don't tell me you don't
remember, either.

128
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,620
I thought you wanted kids, Steven.

129
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,757
Yeah, but not right this second, no.

130
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,998
Just tell me what you feel.

131
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,804
I'm not gonna tell you I'm thrilled about
an unplanned pregnancy, all right?

132
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,177
I thought you'd be okay with this.

133
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,009
We've talked about it, like,
a million times.

134
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:39,284
Yeah, for the future.
I mean, this a huge step.

135
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,792
Yeah, but these are our
baby years, Steven.

136
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,160
Let's just do it.

137
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,501
Jesus Christ, Carol. I mean...

138
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:55,139
This is the sort of thing that people
talk about before they jump into it.

139
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,711
- Well, that's what we're doing now.
- Yeah, after the fact. It's done.

140
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:37,008
- I've never been to Hollywood before.
- Hollywood's a toilet.

141
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,516
Hey, says you! I feel
glamorous just being here.

142
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,713
- She locked me out of my bedroom.
- That's sad.

143
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,082
That woman does it
to me all the time.

144
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,284
Well, you gotta get
a new woman, like me.

145
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,622
- Hey, baby, what's up?
- Jesus Christ.

146
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,503
Hello.

147
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,505
- Hello.
- Hello.

148
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,080
Can we have a room?

149
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,613
You see that sign?

150
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,718
- We don't allow prostitution in here.
- You think I'm a prostitute?

151
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,285
- You didn't say you were a prostitute.
- She ain't a prostitute.

152
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,519
We just want a room.

153
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,224
I only have one room.
You'll have to share.

154
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,328
You only got one? How much, man?

155
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:34,633
- One lady and two little children.
- Hey!

156
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,004
- Special price for you. 95 bucks.
- These are not my children.

157
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,617
Damn it!

158
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,653
- You got any rubbers?
- No...

159
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:02,024
...and if you start fucking that girl
while I'm trying to sleep, I'll kill you.

160
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,362
Then put your headphones on,
my friend...

161
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,302
...because tonight I'm feeling good.
- I'm glad someone is.

162
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,208
Oh, God, I feel so much better.

163
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,705
I'm gonna take a shower.

164
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:25,213
Hey, Lucy. You notice how
we stalk one another?

165
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,071
For you. For moi.

166
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,672
I like to drink.

167
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,715
Smells good.

168
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,487
Say, that's smooth. What is this?

169
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,631
It's an original creation of mine.

170
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,566
Imported cherry-flavored
morphine syrup from France...

171
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,572
...and cognac. I just wish
I had a fucking crêpe.

172
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,444
You're a very interesting man.
You're very direct.

173
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,174
I think you have a lot of
owl medicine in you.

174
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,376
Hey, come here.
Come here.

175
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,152
So pretty.

176
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,455
- Fuck.
- What is it? Your back?

177
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,996
- No.
- Did your back go out?

178
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,066
Here, stand up. Stand up.

179
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,099
It's gonna be okay.
Look, here, ready?

180
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,401
Oh, God, Lucy, no!

181
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:55,044
- What did you do?
- I adjusted you.

182
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,412
Make me another drink.

183
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,043
Here.

184
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,628
That is better.

185
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,276
Daddy's back.

186
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:32,145
- Hey, Rolfe, you want a cocktail?
- In your dreams.

187
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,047
It's okay. Look.
He's got a prescription.

188
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,083
Well, that doctor he goes to,
he ought to be locked up.

189
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:49,290
Now, I'm real sore
and I'm real tired.

190
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,335
So keep it down.

191
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,330
No smoking.

192
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,305
Fuck!

193
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,242
Hey, buddy, you all right?

194
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,177
Hey, Maurice.

195
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,655
What's the matter with him?

196
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,356
He's got ulcers, a herniated disk...
It's just little people shit.

197
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,125
But he's just too stubborn
to take care of himself.

198
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,358
- Are you all right?
- Bed.

199
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,765
You're bleeding, man.

200
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,541
Oh, fuck.

201
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,610
You're bleeding.
I'm gonna call a doctor.

202
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,049
Yeah, hello? Could you give
me the number...

203
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,745
...of a Dr. Carl Morris in Encino?
- Oh, no! No!

204
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,578
No fucking doctors!

205
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,783
No doctors!

206
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,225
Jesus Christ, man.
I'm just trying to fucking help you.

207
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,357
I'm getting out of here.

208
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,601
So hot.

209
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,447
- Who is it?
- Hey, it's me. Rolfe.

210
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,018
- Rolfe.
- Let me in.

211
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,478
Be quiet, Buster.

212
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,222
Oh, I wasn't sure I'd ever
see you again.

213
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,759
Yep. I'm back.

214
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,064
I saw your article in Harper's
about the Republicans.

215
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,667
Becoming very successful.

216
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:07,335
Yeah, well, we need to get syndicated.
That's the ticket.

217
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,072
Look at the little love nest.

218
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,270
Come on, Rolfe. I don't
have a boyfriend, okay?

219
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:20,214
- Yeah? Well, I don't see two beds.
- Well, he sleeps on the couch.

220
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:24,379
Lighten up, Rolfe. God.
We're not close like that.

221
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,154
I let him fuck me twice. Okay?
I felt sorry for him.

222
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:34,026
His whole family was evicted from
their apartment in the Gaza Strip.

223
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,326
I mean, how would you feel?

224
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:40,801
You need to cut loose from all this
shit that seems to follow you around.

225
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,075
It wouldn't be like that
if we were together again.

226
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,769
Come on, Rolfe. I'm ready
for an adult relationship.

227
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,478
Yeah, well, it sure looks like it.

228
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,742
- Sally?
- Oh, my God. It's Adrissi!

229
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,576
- Sally.
- Well, let me come talk with him.

230
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,121
You wait here. Be quiet.

231
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,459
What are you doing here?

232
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,291
I quit my job.

233
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,764
How do you expect to get your own
place if you can't keep a job...

234
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:15,005
Do not give to me this shit. All right?
I need just money for the bus.

235
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,576
"Do not give to me this shit"?
Adrissi, I have to pay my phone bill.

236
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,577
All right, I will pay you back.
In your G-spot.

237
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,740
Fine! I won't pay my phone bill.
Wait here.

238
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,458
Give me a couple of bucks.
Keep your mouth shut.

239
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,094
Jesus Christ.

240
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,357
You need some money, man?
How much you need?

241
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,097
Who is this man in your
bedroom, huh?

242
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,632
Let's cut the bullshit. Just tell him
what you told me and get it over with.

243
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,746
- What's he doing in your bedroom?
- None of your business.

244
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,483
So get your shit together and get
the hell out before I call the cops.

245
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,552
No. I want to know, now,
why this man is in your bedroom.

246
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,484
- Well...
- Because we are gonna fuck, okay?

247
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,990
- That what you wanna hear?
- We're not fucking.

248
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,492
So just get your unemployed
ass out of here, now!

249
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,062
But all those things you said
in the darkness.

250
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,463
You said I was the sexiest stud
you had. You opened your heart.

251
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,661
- Keep your mouth shut, Adrissi.
- You told me I was a hunk.

252
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,530
Shut the fuck up!

253
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,769
Mercy. In a while, man, this ain't
gonna seem like such a big deal.

254
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,478
- Don't. Rolfe.
- You banged Sally!

255
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:33,516
- You fucking whore! You slut!
- He's fucking going nuts, Sally!

256
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,653
- Don't...!
- No, you get out of my way, now!

257
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,123
Stop it! Get off of him!
Stop it!

258
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:47,021
Don't. Get your hands off of him!
Stop it! No! Get off of him!

259
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,167
- No!
- God!

260
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,476
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

261
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,407
I'm out of here.

262
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,577
But Rolfe, you gotta tell
the cops what he did to us.

263
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:14,658
You know what, Sally?
Why don't you tell the cops.

264
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:23,532
"Wait two minutes. Look to see if two
visible lines have formed in the tube.

265
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:28,662
Two visible lines indicate a positive
test" for being knocked up.

266
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,694
Let's go, Chuck! You got what it takes
to be a firefighter? I don't think so!

267
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,131
Come on, fat boy! Didn't I tell you
to lose weight four months ago?

268
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,034
Yes, I did! And you have not!

269
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:06,776
How are you gonna be any good to
anybody if you can't put dirt on a fire?

270
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,377
Stop! Get out of the horseshoe
and get the hose! Get up the hill.

271
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,540
Your execution is piss-poor.

272
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:17,053
The fires are still burning. Not only
are you slow, but you suck at it!

273
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,592
You're going up to the 18th floor.
You've got a woman and child. What?

274
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,785
What do you think you're doing?

275
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,690
- What?
- You're being a total asshole.

276
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,000
Take five, Chuck.

277
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,235
Hi. Is Steven still around?

278
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,535
Oh, no. He left already.
He'll be back in a week.

279
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,777
- A week?
- Who are you?

280
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,242
I'm Rolfe. I'm his brother.

281
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,711
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm Carol.

282
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,589
Well, listen, Carol.
You think I could come in?

283
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,454
I'm a little messed up right now.

284
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,620
Yeah. I was gonna ask
you about that.

285
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,130
- Thank you.
- Sure.

286
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:46,604
- You were attacked? You're kidding.
- Does it look like I'm kidding?

287
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,747
Go ahead. Come on. Let me...

288
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,048
So, what? You got mugged
or something?

289
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:59,555
You could say that.
A guy tried to kill me.

290
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,058
Judging from those bruises on
your neck, I'd say he was serious.

291
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,163
Oh, he's probably in jail by now.

292
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,435
So are you and Steven
blood brothers?

293
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,567
Yeah, you could say that.
We're twins.

294
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,313
God, I can't believe that.

295
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:33,588
We've been living together since May.
We're getting married in the summer.

296
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,094
Well, he didn't mention anything?

297
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,790
No. But maybe he wanted
it to be a surprise.

298
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,504
Listen, are your parents...

299
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,403
What, little? Yeah.

300
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:54,511
Steven, he's the big guy
in the family.

301
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,511
Listen, Carol, do you think it'd
be okay if I sat down for a while?

302
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,551
I've got nowhere to go
at the moment.

303
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,213
No, sure. Stay as long
as you'd like.

304
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,985
I have to go out for a few hours.

305
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,492
But I'd really like to talk to you.

306
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,092
Oh, God. This feels good.

307
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,474
Would you like something to eat?
You want some coffee?

308
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,044
Rolfe?

309
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,554
Good morning, Romeo.

310
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,328
How you feeling? You feel better?

311
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,491
No. I feel like death.

312
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,572
That's great.
Death's a great transition.

313
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,108
- Maid!
- I'm sorry. Please move along.

314
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:42,413
- We're making a love nest in here.
- It's 3:00 and I want to go home!

315
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:47,422
Go away. We are eating each other.

316
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,294
Where's Rolfe?

317
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,196
He left because you
were mean to him.

318
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,103
Checkout time is 12:00!

319
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,443
Merde, I'll kill him.

320
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,276
- You're paying an extra day.
- Hey. Hey.

321
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,079
What are you doing?
Put it away.

322
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,121
Open the door or I'm calling
the cops. Prostitute!

323
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,987
Hey! You go away! You called me
a prostitute last night.

324
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,721
- I heard what you said...
- Open up!

325
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,433
Bastard! I have had enough of
name-calling, you understand?

326
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,037
I'm calling you a prostitute!

327
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,007
You're a prostitute!

328
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,533
Come on.

329
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:46,080
Come on. Let's go! Get your shit
together. You wanna get pinched?

330
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,651
So beautiful, there.

331
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,086
Come on, Maurice!

332
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,393
Everyone knows
that's called the B.A.

333
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,327
Now, you wanna check
your regulator every day.

334
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,433
Rule number one with the
regulator is never use oil in it.

335
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:08,028
You use oil in this regulator
and you'll end up in a situation.

336
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,632
We're gonna take five.

337
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,005
Hey, Carol. What's going on?
Is everything okay?

338
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:20,146
Your brother dropped by
this morning.

339
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,451
You drive here to tell me that?

340
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:28,251
You could have let me know that
everyone in your family is a midget.

341
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,554
Well, they're not midgets.
They're dwarfs.

342
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,485
Whatever.

343
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:37,190
But it suddenly occurred to me
that it's a genetic thing, right?

344
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,200
Yeah, it's a genetic thing.

345
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:44,331
Just tell me. If you and I have a kid
together, is it gonna be a midget?

346
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:49,272
- Carol, don't say midget. Say dwarf.
- Just answer the question, Steven!

347
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:57,154
- It's possible. It's definitely possible.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

348
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,655
Look, Carol. Hey. If it makes
you feel any better...

349
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,256
...I was gonna tell you.
- Really?

350
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,056
- Yeah.
- So why didn't you?

351
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,995
I don't know. I didn't think it
was that important.

352
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,466
- You didn't think it was important?
- Don't start passing judgment.

353
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,038
Hey, I'm not passing judgment
on you, okay?

354
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,039
I'm just trying to understand.

355
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,339
I honestly don't know why I didn't
mention it. It wasn't the right time.

356
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,381
What's going on here, Steven?

357
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,144
Don't you want to be in
a relationship with me?

358
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,382
Where in the hell did that
come from, Carol?

359
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:36,118
You go ahead and do whatever
you want. You do what you want.

360
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,457
- What, you just don't care?
- Now, you know I care.

361
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,532
I won't jump through hoops
because you're threatening me.

362
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,602
- What? I was not threatening you.
- Yeah, you were.

363
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:50,037
This whole will to motherhood, Carol.
It's becoming quite an obsession.

364
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,609
Well, I thought that's why
we were getting married.

365
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,673
Look, there's other reasons
that people get married.

366
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,455
We could always adopt.

367
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,116
What, and never have
children of our own?

368
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,987
I just don't know if that's
gonna be possible.

369
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:16,524
What did you think I'd do when I found
out your family were all midgets?

370
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,468
Did you think I'd walk away?

371
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,470
Keep saying "midgets,"
you'll piss a lot of people off.

372
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,734
- I really don't care about that stuff.
- Okay. Okay.

373
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,247
Would it really be that big of a deal
if our kid was a dwarf?

374
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,084
Look, it's not something
you just walk into.

375
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,156
Well, you could have told me.

376
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,629
Okay.

377
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,632
I gotta go back to work, okay?

378
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,297
I'll call you when I get some
time to talk, all right?

379
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,500
Okay.

380
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,234
See you at home.

381
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,325
Okay.

382
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,768
Catch me if you can.

383
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,243
- I can't believe I didn't see it.
- What?

384
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,714
What a treasure you are.

385
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,552
Tell me where you come from.

386
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,622
Well, my body's originally
from New York.

387
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:51,023
But I've been communing
for the last three years in Phoenix.

388
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,629
Phoenix.

389
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,129
Tell me about Phoenix.

390
00:33:55,566 --> 00:34:00,299
Well, my ex-old man, Jerome,
he used to whittle wood jewelry.

391
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,099
See?
He whittled all this for me.

392
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,004
He even whittled me a wedding ring.
See the splinter?

393
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,204
Then he turned really evil.
He was a truck driver...

394
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,179
...and those guys are all on crank.

395
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:17,276
And there's those, you know,
transsexual prostitutes.

396
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,652
Anyway, he flipped out
and thought I was an alien walk-in.

397
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:26,127
- You don't wanna hear this stuff.
- No. No, I do.

398
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,659
What?

399
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,667
Oh, really?

400
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,779
No, I'm sorry you're lonely.

401
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,040
Yeah, well, maybe
your security guard pal.

402
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,380
Now, maybe he can come over
and comfort you.

403
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,149
No, really.
Sally, I'm not being snide.

404
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,724
No.

405
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,521
You know, okay, I'm a bastard.

406
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,394
All right. Yeah.
I'm a motherfucker.

407
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:08,062
I'm a dick too. Yeah?
I'm a fuckwad. I'm a fucking fart...!

408
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,441
Sally, I'm gonna hang up.

409
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,069
I'm...
Sally?

410
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,012
I'm sorry, I...

411
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:31,153
That was the girl that tried
to have me killed this morning.

412
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,288
Well, I guess you have good reason
to be cross with her.

413
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:48,036
Look, I'm sorry
if I acted weird this morning.

414
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,009
It was all right.

415
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:54,084
I was just in shock, is all.

416
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,212
Meaning me?

417
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,718
I'm pregnant, okay?

418
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,327
It was something we were
making plans for, we just...

419
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:11,196
We weren't planning
on it happening now.

420
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,198
Right.

421
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,270
And Steven?
He never told you about me?

422
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:21,777
No. But Steven's a normal-size guy...

423
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:26,482
...so maybe a child
of ours wouldn't be affected.

424
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,377
I'm not sure that's how it works.

425
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,354
Well, I mean...

426
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,188
...what do I know, you know.
I'm not a doctor.

427
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,630
I know some people, though,
who are...

428
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:43,233
You know, they'd refer you
to a specialist or something.

429
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,232
I could ask them.

430
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:51,339
- Yeah.
- Congratulations. Either way.

431
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,337
Thanks.

432
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,348
We could've just gotten
this information on the phone.

433
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,317
Yeah, we could...

434
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:08,789
...but what you need now
is a real support network.

435
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,619
Hope my Uncle Bobby
don't yell at me.

436
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,254
Don't freak out. It's not like
we're all dysfunctional or anything.

437
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,764
Why is he gonna yell at you?

438
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,696
Well, I didn't make
the convention Sunday night.

439
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:24,064
- What convention?
- It's a thing for little people.

440
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,540
It's an annual thing where
they get together...

441
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,669
...from all over the country
and they eat or they chat.

442
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,045
Meet old friends, you know, catch up.

443
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,044
- Asshole.
- We're here.

444
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,787
Rolfe's here!
My dad's in the back yard.

445
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,458
Yeah?

446
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,461
Margaret, this is Carol. Carol, this
is Margaret. Margaret's my cousin.

447
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,295
- Hi there.
- Hi.

448
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,262
So you and Steven
are getting married.

449
00:37:55,406 --> 00:38:00,002
Yeah. I think maybe
he wanted it to be a surprise.

450
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,704
Why? Now that
you're expecting a baby...

451
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,245
...nothing to grope around
in a fog of uncertainty.

452
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,982
If I have this baby
and it turns out to be little...

453
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,122
...what does that mean
in terms of raising him?

454
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,987
There'll be rough patches,
there's no doubt about it.

455
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,061
But that's what life is all about.
Dealing with hardship.

456
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:23,030
If a person can't deal with that,
then they can't ever be happy.

457
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,498
Would you have had us again,
Daddy?

458
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,164
I'd have to think long
and hard about that.

459
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,073
Long and hard.

460
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,412
I think what Carol's thinking about
is the medical aspects of the situation.

461
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,708
Yeah, that's totally
what I'm thinking about.

462
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,416
I could give you
a list of doctors to call...

463
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,084
...and give you literature
on organizations.

464
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,553
- Good idea.
- Look at it when you get a chance.

465
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,159
I will, thank you.
Thanks.

466
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,660
Look, Carol, if you ever
need anybody to talk to...

467
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,997
...I want you to call me, okay?
- Yeah.

468
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,725
I mean it.

469
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,629
Oh, I'm sorry.

470
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,536
Sweetheart, you don't have
anything to be sorry about.

471
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,004
I'm just so embarrassed.

472
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,408
Now, why on Earth
would you feel embarrassed?

473
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,981
Because here I am, questioning
whether or not to bring a person...

474
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,085
...into the world who's just like you.

475
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,449
Oh, my God,
what must I sound like?

476
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:23,218
You're only concerned about
your baby. That's natural, honey.

477
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,127
I just want my kid to have a happy,
productive life.

478
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,663
Of course you do.

479
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:33,493
There's nothing about being little that
precludes being happy. Or productive.

480
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,799
Yeah.
Look at us.

481
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,115
Hi, Steven.

482
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,583
- Hey, sweetie, how you doing?
- Okay.

483
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,416
Good, good.

484
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,387
Have you been thinking about things?

485
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,093
A little bit, you know?
I mean, it's been...

486
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,289
...pretty busy up here.

487
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,799
Say, how'd it go with Rolfe?

488
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,066
He's asleep on the couch.

489
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,166
Well, good for him.
Good for him.

490
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,266
What, is that a problem?

491
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,674
No, no, that's not a problem.
No problem at all.

492
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,476
We went for brunch
this afternoon...

493
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,209
...at your uncle's house.

494
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:25,549
God, they were so nice.
Bobby invited me to a party...

495
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,249
...at Jerry Robin, Jr. 's
house tomorrow night.

496
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,987
I was kind of hoping
we could all go together.

497
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,631
- Tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

498
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,496
Well, sure, Carol. I tell you what,
why don't I just meet you there.

499
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,561
You know what, my battery
is just about to die on me.

500
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,698
So I will see you tomorrow. Sleep tight
and sweet dreams, sweetie.

501
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,136
Okay.

502
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,423
That was smart.

503
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,531
You wanna go to a party
tomorrow night?

504
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,546
Oh, it looks like the mothership.

505
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,653
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

506
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,632
You said these parties got wild.
I never expected this.

507
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,502
- Well, Jerry sure can throw a party.
- This party's loud.

508
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:05,211
You know, Jerry, I think
you might be a little too old for me.

509
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,484
Too old? Girl, you done
hurt my feelings.

510
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,640
Oh, excuse me.

511
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,246
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, sweetie.

512
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:42,348
- You been drinking?
- No, silly. I can't drink. I'm pregnant.

513
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,983
Yes, you are.

514
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,493
I wanna introduce you
to a couple of my students.

515
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,189
Darlene, Bernadette,
this is my fiancée, Carol.

516
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,628
- Hi.
- Hi.

517
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,236
That's my favorite dress.

518
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,698
There's sure a lot
of midgets around here.

519
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,140
Actually, it's "little people. "

520
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:03,076
There we go. Look who's brushing
up on the terminology.

521
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:07,081
Is that Jerry Robin, Jr.
Sitting over there?

522
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:12,082
- It sure is.
- I'm gonna get an autograph.

523
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,050
- Hey.
- Yeah.

524
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:20,425
- Wanna get a drink or something?
- I'd love to get a drink.

525
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,494
- Hey, Sally. Hey, Rolfe.
- Hey.

526
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,799
- Have you seen Maurice and Lucy?
- Oh, no, not again.

527
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,509
- What happened to your eye?
- He was defending my honor.

528
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,009
Yeah.

529
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,613
- You wanna get a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

530
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,414
That bourgeois shit
makes me want to vomit.

531
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,318
Do you hear me?

532
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:51,417
You don't approve of my methods?
Well, I don't approve of your methods.

533
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,495
Would you mind
not doing that, please?

534
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:58,067
- Doing what?
- Waving your finger in people's faces.

535
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,136
- It's rude.
- Hey.

536
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,138
You better back off, Goldie Hawn.
My man can do what he wants to do.

537
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,468
Listen to me.

538
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:10,205
Because I want you to know what
I think about your organization.

539
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:16,081
You go, "We are the little people.
Please, we are so cute and cuddly.

540
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,313
Don't discriminate against us. "

541
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,980
Our organization has battled
long and hard...

542
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,989
...to sweep away those stereotypes.

543
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,563
Another thing: I think the term
"little people" is demeaning.

544
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,097
- Carol, Sally.
- Hi.

545
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,202
What sort of political activity
do you suggest we create...

546
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,701
...once we disband,
because we're so bourgeois?

547
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,031
What you people don't understand
is that political power...

548
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,006
...it grows out of the barrel of a gun.
- Yeah, right.

549
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,045
Now you want us to commit violence.

550
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,343
We don't do that here.
Americans don't do that.

551
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,144
Oh, Americans.

552
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:51,220
Yeah, the people that saved
your ass during World War II.

553
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,687
Oh, now you want to talk about
the fucking war.

554
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,119
Why are we talking to this guy?

555
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:00,287
- He is very passionate.
- Don't you patronize me.

556
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,365
- Yeah.
- Who do you think you are?

557
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,559
I am French!
And I'm proud to be French.

558
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,662
I am proud not to eat this disgusting
swill you people call cuisine.

559
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,537
- I am proud.
- Excuse my friend... Fuck.

560
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,202
- Fuck.
- Fucking asshole.

561
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,407
Bobby is my uncle. Besides being my
uncle, he happens to be a great guy.

562
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,381
- He is nothing.
- Oh, fuck.

563
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,716
- Who the fuck are you, anyway?
- Hey, I know who I am.

564
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:29,288
And I know what I am.
I am a Marxist.

565
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,190
- Who are you?
- I don't wanna hear about it.

566
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:37,733
Just lay off. I don't even wanna see
you the fuck near him. You got it?

567
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,026
Fine.

568
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,082
So have you known Rolfe
a long time?

569
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,418
- Yeah, we used to date in high school.
- No, really?

570
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,390
- He went to high school?
- Yeah, that was ages ago.

571
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,187
I'm just waiting...

572
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:11,995
What's the matter, you got some
kind of identity crisis going on?

573
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,400
What are you talking about?

574
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,038
Why didn't you tell
your girlfriend about us?

575
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,736
What's it to you, man?

576
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:25,310
Okay. Forget about us, forget about
family, you just focus on this:

577
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,408
You knocked up this gal and didn't
tell her that her baby might be little.

578
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:33,249
- And how's that any of your business?
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm your brother.

579
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,018
It hurts to think that
you're so ashamed of it.

580
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,559
Oh, goddamn you, Rolfe.

581
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,753
Man, sometimes
you are so full of shit.

582
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,088
- I'm full of shit?
- Yeah, full of shit.

583
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,257
Just because I'm not
one of these guys...

584
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,426
...who has to bare his soul
to everybody.

585
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,471
- I'm not like you.
- Sorry, I should've been more careful.

586
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,336
I should've kept in mind
that anyone who meets you...

587
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,242
...will automatically know that you've
got a twin brother who's a midget.

588
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,109
- God.
- You know, when she saw me...

589
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,409
...she got it, straight up.

590
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,387
And I just... I just...

591
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:10,355
...introduced her to people who could
answer some questions and that's it.

592
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,486
Look, it's my life too, okay?

593
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,622
If you wanna blame someone
for being nosy, then blame me.

594
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,668
I needed information, I got it.
Rolfe didn't do anything.

595
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,601
- Hey, you don't have to defend me.
- I can if I want.

596
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,367
I'm gonna find Sally.
I'm gonna take Sally home.

597
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,603
- Look, you want me to drive you?
- No, I'll take a cab.

598
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,315
- Are you mad at me now?
- No, I'm not mad.

599
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,185
I'm just bewildered.

600
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:49,732
Look, Carol, I wish I had some
answers, all right? But I don't.

601
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:55,494
- All right? Not right now. Come here.
- Yeah, well, it's been a crazy week.

602
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,504
Yeah.

603
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,575
- Jesus, Steven.
- It's gonna be all right, baby. All right?

604
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,011
I'll make it up to you.
Just give me some time.

605
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:15,384
I can't find her anywhere.

606
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:19,120
- She's gotta be around here.
- I saw Sally there a little while ago.

607
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,491
Thanks, Augie.

608
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,729
You go get the car,
I'll help Rolfe find his girlfriend.

609
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,230
Sally!

610
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,399
Rolfe?
Hey, Rolfe, wait up.

611
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,407
Oh, shit.

612
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:36,739
- Rolfe.
- What's up, man?

613
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,242
- Rolfe.
- That's it.

614
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,248
- I'm done with you, Sally.
- Rolfe? Rolfe.

615
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,417
Hey, Rolfe, wait up.

616
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,214
- What's going on?
- Rolfe caught Sally...

617
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,326
...screwing Jerry Robin, Jr.

618
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,327
- He's really broken up.
- Oh, shit.

619
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,165
- Let's just go, okay?
- All right.

620
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,335
- You got the ticket, sweetie?
- Yeah.

621
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,734
- Here you go.
- Right away, sir.

622
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,308
Listen, can you wait for me
just a second?

623
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,506
Yeah, sure.

624
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,746
What do you say, man?

625
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,657
Carol told me what happened
and that's pretty fucked-up.

626
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,288
What a bitch, huh?

627
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:31,760
I was stupid to think anything
could be different or change.

628
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,028
You think I'm stupid?

629
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,074
- You're asking if I think you're stupid?
- You're taking too long to answer.

630
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,212
Come on, get in the car.
Come home with us.

631
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,481
- I'm waiting for a cab.
- Fuck the cab.

632
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,710
- Come home with us, man.
- You sure?

633
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,445
Yeah, I'm sure.

634
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,083
You already been on the sofa,
haven't you?

635
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,437
Hey.
You're awake.

636
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,143
What's going on?

637
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,110
Can't sleep.

638
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,273
Why, what's the matter?

639
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,317
It's not too late
to think about adopting.

640
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,420
Look.

641
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,654
I'm not one of those crazy
anti-abortion people, Steven...

642
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,988
...you know that.

643
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,596
But I want this baby.

644
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,699
Having a fucked-up kid
is no bed of roses, Carol.

645
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,032
Hey. Do not apply the term
"fucked-up" to our child, okay?

646
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,767
You know what I mean.

647
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,611
Well, what was Rolfe's
childhood like?

648
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,740
Did the other kids
give him a hard time?

649
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,749
No, not really.

650
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,249
There's other problems
with being little...

651
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,359
...besides the social stuff,
you know?

652
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:07,327
- Like what, medical stuff?
- Yeah.

653
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,293
I mean, when Rolfe was a kid...

654
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,267
...he was in a lot of pain.
He used to cry all the time.

655
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:19,168
- Why? Being a little person hurts?
- Yeah.

656
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,474
See, they've got...

657
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:25,138
They've got organs, musculature,
that's too big for their skeleton.

658
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,115
Yeah, right, but they have drugs
for that, don't they?

659
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,082
Yeah, it's called morphine.

660
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,755
Then sometimes they need surgery.

661
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,084
What do you mean?
Did Rolfe need surgery?

662
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,095
No. Thank God, oh, no.

663
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,998
And what was
his teenage years like?

664
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,436
Rolfe as a teenager?

665
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,302
That guy got laid two years
before I did.

666
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,412
- With Sally?
- Absolutely.

667
00:51:56,546 --> 00:52:00,482
You should've seen those two.
They were hysterical.

668
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,053
They were like this dysfunctional
old couple, you know.

669
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,519
This one time in school...

670
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,420
...and they couldn't have been
more than 15 years old...

671
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,686
...it was between classes...

672
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:16,159
...Sally corners Rolfe and she screams
at the top of her lungs...

673
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:22,465
...she says, "Rolfe Bedalia,
you haven't fucked me in five months. "

674
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:25,131
The principal was there.
All the kids were there.

675
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,709
You should've seen Rolfe's face.
It was beautiful.

676
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,707
I was so goddamn
jealous of that guy.

677
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:35,544
Have you ever been involved
with a little person sexually?

678
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,684
No, just kid stuff, you know?

679
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,587
All the kids would come over,
sit in a circle, play doctor.

680
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,790
Couldn't have been more than 10
or 12, so that doesn't count.

681
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,069
So you had a circle jerk
with a bunch of little people?

682
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,797
I would've loved to see that.

683
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,742
- You would like to see that.
- Yes, I would.

684
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:26,094
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, I really am.

685
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:32,036
You sure you're not just trying to make
some weird political statement?

686
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,607
Oh, God.
What a peculiar thing to say.

687
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,305
Well, I'm a peculiar guy.

688
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,342
I'm serious.

689
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:51,120
I think you have a lot of ambivalence
about your family being little.

690
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:55,224
It's not healthy and I think you should
consider getting some help.

691
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,537
Are you saying you think
I need to see a shrink?

692
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,699
God, there's nothing wrong
with seeing a shrink, okay?

693
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,406
Don't you see?

694
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,109
It's not a good thing
for a child, if he's little...

695
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,651
...to have a father who's ambivalent
about little people.

696
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,766
I hope you'll at least consider it.

697
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:51,079
So tell me, Carol, what is it exactly
you do for a living?

698
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,149
- I'm a painter.
- A painter?

699
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,560
What, you mean, like, fine art?

700
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,656
- Did you go to school?
- Yeah...

701
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,698
...to the New York School
of Art and Design.

702
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,194
I'm impressed.

703
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:10,305
- You mean you make money at that?
- Yeah, it pays the bills.

704
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:21,009
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Lefarge.
Welcome, I'm Steven.

705
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,482
- How do you do?
- Very well.

706
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,144
Carol said you were handsome.
Isn't he handsome?

707
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,755
- Oh, my God.
- Y'all come on in.

708
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,786
- How was the drive?
- Not bad, not bad.

709
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,490
- Good.
- Mom, Dad.

710
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,618
- Hi, sweetie.
- There you are.

711
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:37,597
Oh, honey, you look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

712
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,568
This is Steven's father, Bruno,
and his mom, Kathleen.

713
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:46,072
And over behind the bar
is Steven's brother, Rolfe.

714
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,170
- Hi.
- How are you?

715
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,610
Everyone, this is my mom and dad,
Kirk and Sylvia.

716
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,615
- Nice to meet you.
- So, what are y'all drinking?

717
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,619
Let me have a 7 and 7.

718
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,621
Sylvia?

719
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:07,530
- She'll have a vodka tonic.
- Vodka tonic, coming up.

720
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,392
- I'll help you.
- So you wanna come out back?

721
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,592
- We're all set up out there.
- All right.

722
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:17,165
Thought she might want a double.

723
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,605
You all right?

724
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:24,478
So there's pretty good money in this
firefighting business, is there?

725
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:27,276
Well, actually, I train cadets
to be firefighters.

726
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,648
And, you know, fires
are pretty much recession-proof.

727
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,415
I'd say it's pretty steady, yeah.

728
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,252
- Where did you learn all this stuff?
- In the Navy.

729
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,792
- You're a Navy man?
- Yes, sir.

730
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,119
Well, what do you know?
Navy man myself.

731
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,161
- All right.
- Where were you stationed?

732
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,732
Get me that barbecue sauce
from the kitchen.

733
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,037
Pop's pretty much a fanatic
when it comes to the barbecue.

734
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,677
- You could've prepared us for this.
- I didn't think it was important.

735
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,642
Embarrass me,
I won't speak to you.

736
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,580
- So just get it together, Mom, okay?
- Always the nonconformist.

737
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,277
- How's everybody's drink?
- Still working on mine, thanks.

738
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,119
Sylvia?

739
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:10,991
- Where's that sauce, Steven?
- Yeah, yeah, on it, Pop.

740
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,288
Okay, everybody.
Hors d'oeuvre time.

741
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:20,526
Everybody, please gather round.
I would like to propose a toast.

742
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,671
Hey, Rolfie!

743
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:29,101
To a very beautiful young woman
and a very fine young man...

744
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:34,311
...who are very much in love and who,
hopefully, as the years go by...

745
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,544
...will find the same joy
and happiness...

746
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:41,555
...that Steven's mother
and I have found these past 30 years.

747
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,183
- Hear, hear.
- Amen.

748
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,133
There once was a young fellow
from Sparta

749
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:56,329
- No, Kirk.
- Who was a real whiz as a farter

750
00:57:56,506 --> 00:58:00,306
He'd fart anything,
from "God Save the King"

751
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,003
To Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata

752
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:08,209
He'd fart a gavotte for a starter
And then a Handelian cantata

753
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:13,681
Boost up his ass
Blast Bach's B minor Mass

754
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,426
And then counterpoint La Traviata

755
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,357
That has to be the last one.

756
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,457
- Obviously, he can't drink any more.
- Yes, he can.

757
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:30,437
- No, no, this is getting better, yes.
- No, give him some water. My God.

758
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:33,736
- You have no idea...
- Yes, drink away.

759
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,807
You know, these steaks
are really delicious.

760
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,208
Genuine prime rib.
I have it brought in from Omaha.

761
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,376
- I'm stuffed like a pig.
- Save some room for dessert, Rolfe.

762
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,147
Oh, no, I can't.
I can barely breathe, I'm so full.

763
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,589
Is everything all right, Sylvia?

764
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,089
Oh, yes.
I was just thinking, is all.

765
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,630
Sylvia.
Don't think.

766
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,765
I think that there's something
that we need to bring up...

767
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,065
...that you won't want to hear.
- Mom.

768
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,145
I'm sorry. But this has
to be brought out into the open.

769
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:16,483
I certainly wouldn't want anyone
to think that we're prejudiced people.

770
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,018
Daddy.

771
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,582
All right, Kirk, you tell them.

772
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,192
You're a lot more diplomatic
than I am.

773
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:29,523
Well, the fact of the matter is...

774
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,427
...Carol's grandfather
is getting on in years.

775
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,136
- Please.
- And...

776
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:41,676
...he's an Orthodox Jew. And he's
never forgiven us for going Reform.

777
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,178
So unless you can bring yourself
to have a Jewish wedding...

778
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:48,375
...would you at least consider
a civil ceremony?

779
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:51,611
Otherwise, we won't
be able to invite him.

780
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,657
I got no problem with
a Jewish wedding.

781
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,365
Are you sure?

782
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,397
Yeah. Mom?

783
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,532
Pop? Carol?

784
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,373
- Rolfe?
- Lf he dies before they get married...

785
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,606
...can we switch back to Catholic?

786
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,583
When a man and a woman
come together before God...

787
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,991
...and announce their intentions...

788
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,563
May God be blessed with
the men and women...

789
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,172
...of Israel and every generation...

790
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,307
Look at that wedding dress.
That's a waste of a dress.

791
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:51,640
Look at that belly.

792
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:55,683
- I would not kick her out of bed.
- You're starting to piss me off now.

793
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,976
Enough with her.

794
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,112
But you love me.

795
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:04,753
All right. But you know what?
That should be us down there, right?

796
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,756
Don't you ever think of marrying me?

797
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:14,568
Marriage is for morons.
It turns a lover into a relative.

798
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,501
Like a brother...

799
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,038
...or a sister.

800
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:24,611
I can't think of anything that takes
the passion out of a relationship...

801
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,442
...more than marriage.

802
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,709
You may kiss the bride.

803
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:38,055
Mazel tov!

804
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,355
Oh, my God.

805
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,618
Hello, Mrs. Bedalia.

806
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,492
Nice name, huh?

807
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,996
You know what?
Hold on one second.

808
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,541
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

809
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,417
Rolfe.

810
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,589
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I just wanted to say thank you.

811
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,166
I haven't done anything.

812
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:57,261
God, you did so much.
And I really appreciate it.

813
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,102
Well, Steven's a...

814
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,577
He's a very lucky guy.

815
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:08,775
I just hope he's smart enough
not to screw it up.

816
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:16,789
- So, what are you gonna do now?
- I'm gonna go to my parents' place.

817
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:22,291
Cabin, Big Bear. For the winter.
Get some writing done.

818
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:30,062
I think you're wonderful, Rolfe.

819
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,747
Dr. Morgan, please report
to the administration desk.

820
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:50,684
Dr. Morgan, please report
to the administration desk.

821
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,685
- How you doing, Carol?
- Okay.

822
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,588
Steven?

823
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,991
We're gonna run some tests.

824
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,533
Vincent's gonna have
to stay here at the clinic.

825
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,228
Then we'll start him
on a long-term regimen...

826
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,465
...that we'll keep him
on through puberty.

827
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,509
Just hang in there, honey, okay?
We can handle this.

828
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:11,135
We're talking biweekly
hormone injections...

829
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,078
...monthly blood samples
to monitor his liver function.

830
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,084
After a while you'll be able
to administer the injections yourself.

831
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,248
- It's gonna be a big commitment.
- Yeah, but we're up for that.

832
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,052
- Aren't we, Steven?
- Goddamn it!

833
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,161
Damn it, how can you two
be so calm?

834
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:30,657
Because I'm prepared.
And because we don't have a choice.

835
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,205
I read all the books
that you recommended.

836
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,365
Good.
I think you'll be fine.

837
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,272
- As for you...
- Yeah, what about me?

838
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,709
Please, Steven,
you're gonna frighten the baby.

839
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,412
- What about me?
- I think you should seek...

840
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,716
...some counseling.
- That's what I told him.

841
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,250
Look, what I need...

842
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,524
...are new chromosomes.

843
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,529
You're making this so much harder
than it needs to be...

844
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,495
...do you know that?

845
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:18,208
I can't talk to him.
He won't listen to me.

846
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:26,249
Nurse Simon, please pick up line six.
Nurse Simon, please pick up line six.

847
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:56,415
- How you doing, sweetie?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

848
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,189
How's he doing?

849
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,727
Let me take him for a while.

850
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,001
Are you sure?

851
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,763
Yeah.

852
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,640
- Got him?
- Yeah.

853
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,575
Yeah.

854
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,219
Listen to this guy, huh?

855
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,585
Oh, my God, he's been going
like this for two hours straight.

856
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,326
He hurts.

857
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:17,125
Yeah, well, I gave him
the drops, but...

858
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,325
They seemed to help
a little bit, but...

859
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:22,460
- Give him something stronger.
- I can't. I called them.

860
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:26,439
They said it was normal
for babies with his condition.

861
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:33,471
What?

862
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:37,477
Just say the word one time.

863
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,421
- What?
- Just say the word one time, Carol.

864
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,616
- Please, Steven...
- What's his condition?

865
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,793
Ten months, you haven't said
it one time. What's his condition?

866
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:52,295
Why is he crying? Why is he hurting?
Because he's a dwarf.

867
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,027
- Carol, he's a dwarf!
- Stop it!

868
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:57,172
- He's a baby and you're scaring him!
- A baby and a dwarf...

869
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,432
...and he's crying because he hurts.

870
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,770
- Fuck you!
- His insides can't get outside.

871
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,705
- Fuck you!
- One time!

872
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:06,379
One time, say the goddamn word!

873
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,005
He's a dwarf!

874
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,209
I'm a dwarf!

875
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,263
Look, this can't go on anymore.

876
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,274
Carol, this is just not working out.

877
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,515
Look, no one said
this was gonna be easy.

878
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,778
I know.

879
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:53,189
But it's not getting any better.
Not between us, it's not.

880
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,126
Oh, Steven.

881
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,631
I can't take it.

882
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,536
I mean, it's obvious
that I'm just making things worse.

883
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:18,312
I just think I can
do better by Vincent...

884
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,317
...we can do better by Vincent...

885
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,122
...if I'm somewhere else.

886
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,434
And you really think that?

887
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,130
Yeah.

888
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,332
I do.

889
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,519
Expecting someone?

890
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,625
Not me.

891
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:05,496
Did you fart?

892
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,535
No, I did not fart.

893
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,139
Enough.

894
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,212
Hey.

895
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,709
What are you doing here?

896
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,381
Steven and I separated.

897
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,561
I hope this isn't too much
of an inconvenience.

898
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,690
No, not at all.

899
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,274
Is it okay if we stay for a few days?

900
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,540
Sure. Stay as long as you like.

901
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,207
Thanks.

902
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,209
Is this my nephew?

903
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,747
Holy cow.

904
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,087
He's a good-looking kid.

905
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:03,691
Hey.

906
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,786
Come in.

907
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:20,337
So how do you guys get by
so far from civilization?

908
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:23,036
It's a perfect situation for a writer.

909
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:26,409
- Oh, how's it going, your writing?
- It's pretty good.

910
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:29,574
I'm syndicated in three papers.

911
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:34,086
The San Diegan, The Fresno Bee
and the Chicago Tribune.

912
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:35,416
That's so great.

913
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,754
Rolfe's a middle-of-the-road kind
of guy. That's what they want.

914
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:43,722
Yeah, Maurice thinks that my views
aren't radical enough.

915
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:46,166
- They aren't.
- From what I remember...

916
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,999
...of your politics, I don't think they'd
go over in a mainstream paper.

917
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:53,199
You better be careful,
they could lock you in a loony bin...

918
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,071
...and that's not fun.

919
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,377
If Maurice had his way,
he'd take the heads...

920
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:04,680
...of the members of Congress, put
them on a spear and display them...

921
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,012
...out on the White House lawn.

922
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,085
Yeah, that sounds like the Maurice
I remember.

923
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:16,157
One day, I wanna buy a place like this.

924
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,336
Well, until you do, you can stay here
as long as you want.

925
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,472
Superb.

926
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,699
We need a woman around here.

927
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,206
Someone to do the dishes,
someone to wash the clothes.

928
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,540
In your dreams, pal.

929
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,013
Maurice probably liked it in the
Dark Ages when we scrubbed...

930
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,084
...the skidmarks
out of your loincloth.

931
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:40,483
I think the women's liberation
movement is an excuse...

932
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,250
...for every poor female pig
who needed a reason...

933
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,122
...not to clean up after themselves.
- You know what?

934
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:50,322
Until you stop blasting a hole in the
ozone with your toxic gas attacks...

935
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:53,996
...this little maid's on an extended
coffee break.

936
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,218
Feeding time again.

937
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,988
If you drink, does he get drunk too?

938
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,424
I'm not drunk.

939
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:23,429
Well, maybe a little bit.

940
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,167
Hey, you ever hear from Sally?

941
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,675
Sally? No. We're...

942
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,744
...not in contact right now.

943
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,237
I liked her.

944
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,280
She had her good points.

945
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:46,113
Yeah, well, fuckability, Maurice,
is not the be-all and end-all...

946
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:50,981
Your relationship with Lucy
is nothing to crow about!

947
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,253
Now they fight like this all the time!

948
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:56,125
That's a shame.
You seem like a really good couple.

949
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,294
Turn it down!

950
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,576
Lucy, I've had it with you!

951
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,235
I am not your old lady anymore,
Maurice.

952
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,211
I am moving out of your teepee.

953
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:18,319
That is just super with me!
I can't take it anymore!

954
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,718
Bye, Rolfe. Thanks for everything.

955
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,494
Lucy, I really hate to see you
leave like this.

956
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:29,654
- I am leaving you first.
- Oh, no, you're not. You know what?

957
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,728
Last one who leaves is a rotten egg.

958
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,426
Hey.

959
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,470
How are you, buddy?

960
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,068
Hey.

961
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,359
Caught in the act.

962
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,305
Well, he was awake.

963
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,034
I figured you could use a break.

964
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,549
You go on. Go back to bed.

965
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,280
Really. Get some rest.

966
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,586
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

967
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,093
I'm no expert on babies...

968
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:44,996
...but I think
I got things covered here.

969
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,536
He's okay.

970
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:54,574
Thanks.

971
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,173
Good night.

972
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,442
Hey, Carol.

973
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,381
How was your drive?

974
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,240
It was good.

975
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,478
It was uneventful, you know.

976
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,622
Look at you.

977
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,527
He's getting big and strong.

978
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:26,257
Yeah, he is.

979
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,034
Hello, Vincent.

980
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,101
My little man.

981
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:39,206
How you doing?

982
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,043
I'm doing all right.

983
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,247
I'm working on it.

984
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:53,024
Trying to be the man
that you want me to be.

985
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,625
You've gotta want it too, Steven.

986
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,493
You know what, I do want it.

987
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,167
I love you.

988
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,797
I know that.

989
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:09,175
I've never doubted that for a moment.

990
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:13,505
But it's not about
you and me anymore.

991
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,206
You've gotta love our child.

992
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,646
You don't think that I love Vincent?

993
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:22,382
No, I know that you do.

994
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,623
It's just, you can't show it.

995
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,559
If you can't show it,
then as far as he's concerned...

996
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,688
...it might as well not exist.

997
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,628
Don't you see? Right now,
you don't have a lot to offer him.

998
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,168
No. You're... You're wrong.

999
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,041
That's what I want. I...

1000
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,344
I wanna show it.

1001
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,579
All right? If you'll just give me
another chance.

1002
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:58,290
Look, what goes on
between a parent and a child...

1003
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,519
...that's what's really important.

1004
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:04,127
Vincent's gotta come first.

1005
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:09,435
I'm not angry with you, okay?

1006
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:12,372
I'm not angry.

1007
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,133
And I don't hate you.

1008
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:25,314
So, what are you gonna do, Carol?

1009
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:30,452
You gonna live up here in the woods
like a couple of hippies?

1010
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,354
Listen to me, okay?

1011
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,689
This way, we can all still be family.

1012
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,624
You can see your kid
whenever you want.

1013
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:41,202
But he can't wait around for you.
He has too many needs right now.

1014
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:44,497
- I'm his father.
- But right now you're too self-involved.

1015
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,402
You're too confused.

1016
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:51,205
I've got too much to do already without
spending my time bringing you along.

1017
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,477
And this is what you want?

1018
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,416
This is what I think is right.

1019
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,458
Hey, Rolfe.

1020
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,665
Boy, what you two
must think of me, huh?

1021
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:22,641
What does that mean?

1022
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,042
You're still my brother.

1023
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,179
Coming in?

1024
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:37,558
No, I don't think so.

1025
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:44,657
I'm gonna say goodbye to Vincent
and head on back to the city.

1026
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,718
Are you mad at me?

1027
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,680
No, I'm not mad.

1028
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:18,129
I'll see you around, big boy.

1029
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,443
Love my son.

1030
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:51,425
You're gonna be okay, Steven.

1031
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,529
I'm gonna do my best.

1032
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,218
You okay?

1033
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,015
Yeah.

1034
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:48,485
A little shook-up.

1035
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:52,115
I don't think I'll be getting to sleep
anytime soon.

1036
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,163
Here.

1037
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:58,458
Come with me.

1038
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:04,762
Come on.

1039
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,524
You okay?

1040
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:39,002
It's heavenly.

1041
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,301
Absolutely heavenly.

1042
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,735
Look at the stars.
They're so bright up there.

1043
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:05,131
Rolfe.

1044
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:08,535
What?

1045
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:13,206
You can kiss me if you want.
