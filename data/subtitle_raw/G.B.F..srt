00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,000
Ever notice how in high school

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,878
there's just something
about being first?

36
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,589
Like that girl who's always
first to raise her hand

37
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,385
or that first kid to own
every new cutting-edge iThingy?

38
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,306
There's so much pressure to be
a trend-setter, a pioneer.

39
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,432
Well, not me.

40
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,395
Tanner Daniels was just like any
other average comic-book geek,

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,064
more than content to fly under the radar

42
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,984
and leave the trailblazing
to the others.

43
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,695
After all, of the many firsts
my peers were vying for,

44
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,656
one still remained
conspicuously up for grabs.

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,325
Never in the history
of North Gateway High

46
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,494
had any student admitted out loud

47
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,206
to being an honest-to-goodness,
card-carrying, proud,

48
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,084
or even slightly modest, homosexual,

49
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,420
including me and my best friend, Brent.

50
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,963
Explain this to me again.

51
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,466
How will being the first out kid
in school make you instantly popular?

52
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,845
It's simple. All the teen
and tween rags agree.

53
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,848
The hottest new trend
sweeping schools worldwide

54
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,434
is the GBF.

55
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,728
- GBF?
- Gay best friend.

56
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,355
Every celeb has one,
so every teen girl needs one.

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,066
And pretty soon, all three
prom-queen front-runners

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,319
will be battling it out
for my attention.

59
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,156
♪ H

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,824
♪ E

61
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,868
♪ R

62
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,331
Three powerful cliques
controlled North Gateway High,

63
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,874
and the queen bitch from each

64
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,460
ruled our school
from nearly every direction.

65
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,630
Caprice Winters dominated

66
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,216
as queen of drama,
all three kinds of choir,

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,385
and our school's loose network
of minority students.

68
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,014
Then there was 'Shley Osgoode,
short for "Ashley",

69
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,266
which was about as edgy as she got.

70
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,144
With her perpetually sunny
Mormon disposition,

71
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,107
'Shley ruled all wearers of
shiny gold crosses and goody-two-shoes.

72
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,528
But neither could hold a candle
to Fawcett Brooks.

73
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,157
By far the hottest girl in school
and empress of the rich and popular,

74
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,535
Fawcett loved fads and hated fatties.

75
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,496
Her trademark golden tresses

76
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,123
had won her "best hair"
three years in a row,

77
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,833
an unprecedented achievement

78
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,503
because you're supposed to be
a senior to win.

79
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,840
Like neighbouring warlords
in a third-world country,

80
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,969
they maintained
an uneasy balance of power,

81
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,639
friendly but always vigilant
of anything that could upset the truce

82
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,475
and create all-out social warfare.

83
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,561
So, I'm thinking prom
for maximum effect.

84
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,730
That way, no matter
who wins king or queen,

85
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,357
all anyone will remember is me.

86
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,776
Why not send out a mass text
and be done with it?

87
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,862
"FYI, I like guys.
Now let's never speak of this again."

88
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,573
Tanner, you cannot come out
via text. That is so gay.

89
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,661
Well, you can count me out.
Or in, I guess.

90
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,205
How very early 2000s of you.
I'm so not surprised.

91
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,457
Glenn is more likely
to come out than Tanner,

92
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,876
and he is our token vagina enthusiast.

93
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,129
Damn straight. Literally.

94
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,590
Look, it's not a matter of if
I'm coming out. Of course I am.

95
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,261
It's the "when" I'm still working on.

96
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,346
I just can't believe that you'd be happy

97
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,724
being some vapid whore's
sexless accessory.

98
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,559
Why do you think this plan will work?

99
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,395
Oh, you know I've been doing
my reconnaissance.

100
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,563
Ready? OK!

101
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,441
Fawcett's the obvious
prom-queen front-runner,

102
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,402
but since mega-hottie Hamilton Smith
dumped her last week,

103
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,113
she's vulnerable,
and she'll be looking for an edge.

104
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,823
- Whoo!
- Any edge.

105
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,409
What the hell was that?
You were totally out of sync.

106
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,202
It's that time of the month, ladies.

107
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,122
Please. Their "must-have" list
is so five minutes ago.

108
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,624
- Let's hear it.
- This month's are,

109
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,543
totally bedazzled vintage totes,

110
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,337
chunky cashmere ironic shrugs.

111
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,755
Been there, worn that.

112
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,090
- Distressed jeggings.
- Cute!

113
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,800
I practically invented them.

114
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,013
- Cold langu.
- And a GBF.

115
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,099
- It stands for...
- I know what it stands for.

116
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,354
I can't help it that the school
is devoid of the gay.

117
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,190
If there were some,
they'd obvi worship me.

118
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,067
I mean, look at this.

119
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,445
No, totally. They'd worship you.
Look at you. You're beautiful.

120
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,240
OK, so, Fawcett might fall
for it, but what makes you think

121
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,826
a super-Chris like 'Shley Osgoode
would want a GBF?

122
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,121
'Shley is Mormon. Their shtick
is being relentlessly nice to you

123
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,166
until you give up and throw on
a pair of their magic underwear.

124
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,503
They smile to your face
and Prop-8 you in the back.

125
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,422
I can't believe our godless peers
read this blasphemy.

126
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,551
- They're trying to make sin seem in.
- I don't know.

127
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,970
Don't you ever think
it would be neat to meet one?

128
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,015
- Like a real, live gay?
- What?

129
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,767
We could bring him to youth group

130
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,311
or take him out
for milkshakes or something.

131
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,355
If we're all super-duper nice to him,

132
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,818
maybe he'd realise that the only person
he should be gay for is Jesus.

133
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,363
'Shley, you can't
just befriend these people.

134
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:52,577
They're out to steal
our brothers, boyfriends, our gerbils,

135
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,289
all as part of a secret agenda to spread
their gaybies all over America.

136
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,166
Gay babies?

137
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,670
No! Like... Like gay rabies.

138
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,879
Bitch!

139
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,007
'Shley will try
to befriend me and convert me,

140
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,301
and that'll make Fawcett
want me even more.

141
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,803
So, what about Caprice?

142
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,140
Miss Caprice cannot stand
not being the centre of attention.

143
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,684
You all saw her mostly
plagiarised musical mash-up

144
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,519
of Mean Girls last spring.

- That could've been kind of brilliant.

150
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,829
Caprice needs a gay visionary

151
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,291
to shepherd her career
towards iconic diva-dom.

152
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,835
I hope everything
goes according to plan.

You won't forget us when
you're in a new social stratosphere?

No promises. Oh, my God!
Is that the new one?

Oh, sweet, dude!

156
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,928
And I still carry the last
flip phone on the planet.

00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,222
We are so downloading Guydar.

158
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,725
- What the hell is Guydar?
- Where have you been?

159
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,686
It's the new app that lets
gay guys find other gay guys

160
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,939
through state-of-the-art,
globally positioned technology.

161
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,608
- She knows.
- I only know about it

162
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,360
because Brent here tried
to download it onto my phone.

163
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,322
Yeah, and hetero buzzkill here
totally cock-blocked me.

164
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,159
I'm not soiling my pristine phone
with some slutty gay hookup app.

165

Tanner,
we're not gonna do anything.

166
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,123
We're just gonna see if there are
any other gay guys in this town

167
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,544
and find out how many cubic feet
away they are from us. It's science.

168
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,630
And it's about to change our lives.

169
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,217
Which was actually true,
but not in the way we imagined.

170
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,219
But it isn't fair, Ms Hoegel.

171
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,180
I'm sorry, Soledad,
but the school board was clear.

172
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,849
Now, we can't have
a gay/straight alliance

173
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,726
without an actual gay member.

174
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,394
Just because we're all straight

175
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,189
doesn't mean that there
aren't gay kids at this school.

176
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,900
My future GBF is just waiting
to come out of the closet

177
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,693
and tell me how fierce I am.

178
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,321
Please, Ms H, this club is all I have.

179
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,992
Is this about helping queer
and questioning kids or yourself?

180
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,744
It's all for the gays!

181
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,289
They need to at least know
this group exists.

182
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,959
What if Viola here
came out as a lesbian?

183
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,255
- Hey! I'm strictly dickly, yo.
- Just take one for the team.

184
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,299
- Now, Soledad!
- Braxton has two mommies.

185
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,260
That has got to count for something.

186
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,512
And both Mrs Cooper-Cullins
were so helpful

187
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,014
in organising last month's
vegan bake sale.

188
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,558
Moms say hi, by the way.

189
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,560
Hi, Moms.

190
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,480
But it's simply not enough, I'm afraid.

191
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,611
Please, Ms Hoegel,
just buy me a few more weeks.

192
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,407
I will find a real-life gay, even if
I have to drag the little teen queen

193
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,741
out of the closet myself.

194
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,036
Soledad, I don't want you conducting
some sort of a gay witch-hunt.

195
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,455
- No, of course not, Ms Hoegel.
- Give it time.

196
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,916
One day you will meet
the gay of your dreams,

197
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,087
and it will be the happiest,
most fulfilling day of your life.

198
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,757
Then it's all downhill from there.

199
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,182
Hi, there, Soledad. Or whatever.

200
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,603
You're prez of the school's
currently gay-less GSA, right?

201
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,189
- Yeah, something like that.
- Couldn't help but overhear your dilem.

202
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,485
I might have an idea
that could help you out. Keep up.

203
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,489
The wi-fi password is "Lilo".

204
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,534
- Oh, hey, guys. Where's the fire?
- Oh! Hi, Mom.

205
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,829
Erm, we just got this really
tough math assignment, so...

206
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,039
Oh. Math.

207
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,541
It's gonna be, like,
a really tough nut to bust.

208
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,917
T-T-Y-L!

209
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,586
Later, Mrs Van Camp.

210
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,049
Be safe! W-With your math.

211
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,219
Your mom totally knows
and also thinks we're doing it.

212
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,804
Why don't you just tell her?

213
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,973
She's so smug,
dropping her little hints.

214
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,061
I'm not gonna give her the satisfaction.
Maybe when she gets the balls to ask me.

215
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,438
Maybe she's just respecting
your privacy.

216
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,067
She wants to milk this
for all the drama it's worth.

217
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,361
Trust. I am her son, after all.

218
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:09,334
Do we have to listen
to this heinous pop dance crap?

219
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,919
Shut up. You know you love it.

220
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,880
♪ Why should I be a victim of this love?

221
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,424
♪ Why should I feel so ashamed?

222
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,053
Knock, knock!

223
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,388
What? What do you want?

224
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,015
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah, Mom.

225
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,101
- No, I'm serious.
- Yes, we're decent!

226
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,188
Oh, God. OK, good.
Whew! Just checking. Oh, O-M-G!

227
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,399
This be my jam. Whoo!

228
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,486
You boys have any poppers? A popper
would really hit the spot right now.

229
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,783
Mom, erm, yeah, this dance party
is invitation only, so...

230
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,619
I simply came up to tell you boys

231
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:50,083
that I won't be back up here
for at least one hour or so. Relax.

232
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,294
Do your thing. Get crazy.

233
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,754
- Thanks.
- I'm good with it.

234
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,840
Thank you. Alright. Bye!

235
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,009
Now that we've banished the beast,

236
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,387
let's download that app
and find us some mens.

237
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:06,891
What if we see someone we know on there
or someone finds my phone?

238
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,018
It's my ass on the line.

239
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,605
Tan, please, if I don't at least
get my makeout on before college,

240
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,983
I'll be playing sexual
catch-up for years.

241
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,153
I just want to find out if there are
any other gay guys out there

242
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,905
that, you know, aren't you.
You know, no offence.

243
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,577
OK, fine.

244
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,705
But we're gonna need
a profile picture first. Say "cheese".

245
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,790
Cheddar!

246
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,500
Let me see it.

247
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,627
No.

248
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,671
Hey!

249
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,675
Relax. You'll just be another headless
torso in a sea of low self-esteem.

250
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,219
PS, your abs ain't too bad,
Mr Four-Pack.

251
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,679
Really?

252
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,185
Let's see what the filthy gays
of North Gateway think of them.

253
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,728
You sure this is a good idea?

254
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,273
Was Drake on Degrassi?
The answer is yes.

255
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,649
Bad-ass rapper Drake

256
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:01,488
was on a wholesome Canadian
after-school soap opera. Never forget.

257
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,700
We had little luck chatting up
dudes on Guydar that night,

258
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,621
but the next day, Soledad and her swarm
of blossoming fruit flies

259
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,040
were preparing to put the app
to much better use.

260
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,584
OK, ladies,
somewhere in this school,

261
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:18,338
there's a sexually confused boy with
no one to turn to and nowhere to go.

262
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,133
So we must hunt him down...
to help him, of course.

263
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,344
According to a very knowledgeable source

264
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,221
on what's in style, this Guydar thing

265
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,098
is all the rage with the gays,
especially the closet cases.

266
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,059
We all got our faux-mo avatars ready?

267
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,187
Yep. Mine's of Robert Pattinson's
air-brushed torso.

268
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,397
- That's what they like, right?
- Totally.

269
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,191
And you've got Zac Efron. Perfect.

270
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,193
Persephone's rocking Adam Lambert.

271
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,570
Oh, great. I think we got
all our bases covered.

272
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,198
Let the manhunt begin!

273
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,076
- Oh, shit!
- What was that?

274
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:53,373
Oh, erm, nothing.
Just stating the obvious in here.

275
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,583
Ew. Let's go.

276
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,711
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

277
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,929
Tanner! Hand it over.

278
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,849
You'll get it back
at the end of the day.

279
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,183
Shit.

280
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,394
Come on, come on, come on! Shit!

281
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,110
Montag.

282
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,821
Dienstag.

283
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,072
Mittwoch.

284
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,324
- Mittwoch.
- Donnerstag.

285
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,618
What's up, bitch?

286
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,664
- Herr Brent?
- Ein moment, Frau Burkhardt.

287
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,007
Oh, scheisse!

288
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:49,012
Ooh, I got one! 4Packboy95.
He's 400 feet away.

289
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,307
- I got him, too! This way!
- Yeah!

290
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,685
Give me your phone now! Now!

291
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,439
Oh, my God, Brent!
You're obsessed with that stupid app.

292
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,525
You don't understand. Soledad
and her gaggle of junior hacks

293
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,944
are using Guydar
to track gays at the school.

294
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,989
Oh, my God. Slatsky took
my phone in third period.

295
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,285
It's still signed on.
I am not taking the fall for this!

296
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,288
Time for the big, dramatic coming-out
you've always wanted.

297
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,207
No, no! This is not how I planned it.
Prom is months away!

298
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,626
It's coming from in here.

299
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,586
- We are here to help.
- Come on, guys.

300
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,465
- What do you think you're doing?
- Who do these hairless abs belong to?

301
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,057
The signal's from the front
of the classroom.

302
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:38,561
- You have two seconds to...
- From right around Mr Slatsky's desk?

303
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,563
- Mr Slatsky?
- Mr Slatsky?

304
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:45,193
You're married to a lady,
and these are clearly not your abs.

305
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,945
This is false advertising.

306
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,821
What are you talking about?

307
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,032
Wait! It's not Mr Slatsky's.

308
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,745
- Tanner, I don't think you should...
- This is your cellphone, correct?

309
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,291
I-I guess it is.

310
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:07,090
You're the secret gay.
But you're not even that fabulous.

311
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,886
I... guess I am...

312
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,349
Not fabulous, but gay.
I'm gay, I guess.

313
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,439
Oh, we've got one!
Our very own homosexual!

314
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,027
I have to tweet this right now.

315
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,905
We did it! I'm so excited! Oh, my God!

316
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,665
What are you looking at, fag-off?

317
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,961
What, are you...?
What, are you checking out my... balls?

318
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,296
You trying to check out my balls?

319
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,216
Tanner! Wait! Wait! I'm your friend!

320
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,969
Leave him alone,
you desperate psycho bitch.

321
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,554
Whoa. That was really mean.

322
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,515
- Are you a psycho and are you a bitch?
- I am his best friend.

323
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,019
I couldn't believe it.
I'd been so careful for 17 years.

324
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,855
I learned how to clear
the internet history when I was 11.

325
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,692
One stupid slip-up
had cost me everything,

326
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,736
and I had one person to blame.

327
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,200
Hey, girl, hey.

328
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,662
"Hey"? That's all you have to say?

329
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,832
I'm sorry. I-I freaked.
It happened so fast.

330
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,959
You were the one
who wanted to come out!

331
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,420
I can't believe
you let me take the fall!

332
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,006
Shh, please. Look,
maybe you can turn this around.

333
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,883
You know, pretend it was a joke.

334
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,427
You can't "no homo" this, Brent.

335
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:38,347
I'm basically a dead man, and what
kills me is you're the queeny one.

336
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,851
The least you can do is come out and
take your share of the daily beatings.

337
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,395
I can't. It would be,
you know, pathetic,

338
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,314
like I'm copying you or something.

339
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,524
You know what? I blame myself.

340
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,737
All I ever do is go with the flow,
your flow, 99 percent of the time.

341
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,324
Oh, please, We both know
you love being the sidekick.

342
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,284
So, I'm the sidekick?

343
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,662
Wow. Well, at least now I realise
all you care about is yourself,

344
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,915
you self-absorbed,
gutless little faggot!

345
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,669
- Tanner Daniels!
- Christ, Tanner. I said I'm sorry.

346
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,382
Sorry, Mrs Van Camp,
but I'm allowed to use that word,

347
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,093
seeing as how I am one.

348
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,387
Just like your son.

349
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,434
Tanner, you had no right.

350
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,979
Well, what do you care?
You know she knows.

351
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,273
It was a total dick move,

352
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,652
and I immediately regretted it,
but it was too late.

353
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,614
Like Lex Luthor and Clark Kent
or Professor X and Magneto,

354
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:41,202
Brent and I went from best friends
to archenemies in a matter of seconds.

355
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,412
Hey, Tanner. How was school, honey?

356
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:50,169
Er, hey, Shannon, Dad.
It was uneventful. Lacking events.

357
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,713
Why, you didn't hear anything, did you?

358
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,800
No. What would we
have heard about, Tanner?

359
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:01,722
Nothing, of course, because
of the whole nothing thing.

360
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,766
Honey, that's great. Are you hungry?

361
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,853
I made my world-famous
homemade gluten-free popsicles.

362
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,312
They are delicious.

363
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,857
Oh, I hope you made them
extra thick and fruity,

364
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,692
just the way Tanner likes them.

365
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,819
What? Er, I mean, right.

366
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:19,323
Thanks for freezing juice on a stick
for me, Shannon, but I'm good.

367
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,409
Maybe you'll have one later.

368
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,954
- Maybe I'll have one right now.
- Ooh.

369
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,373
What flavour did you make?

370
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,500
- Cherry.
- Ohh.

371
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,212
The next day, I tried to keep
an even lower profile than usual,

372
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,216
but my power to go unnoticed
had been completely neutralised.

373
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,051
Hey. Remember me?

374
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,305
Hey, Sophe. Sorry I haven't
texted/called you back.

375
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,849
I'm just really overwhelmed right now.

376
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:49,228
Look, I know you're pissed at Brent,
and, honestly, I would be, too.

377
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,606
But what he did was an accident.

378
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,526
- What you did with his mom was...
- Wait. Really? Wow.

379
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,571
Of all people, I never expected
you to take his side.

380
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:04,076
He outed me to the entire school.
And plus, his mom already knew.

381
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,287
It wasn't your job to tell her.
You know that.

382
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,788
You know what, Sophe?

383
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,667
I have bigger things to worry about
than Brent's psycho momma drama.

384
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,506
Well, hey, there, Tan-Tan.

385
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,509
You know, I used to think
you were a little fag.

386
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,554
I didn't realise you were
actually a full-fledged homo!

387
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,932
That doesn't even make sense.

388
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,142
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
You calling me stupid?

389
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,519
You calling me stupid and gay?

390
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,273
Hamilton, take your hands off him.

391
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,108
Back off, babe. We're history,

392
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,819
which means you don't tell me
what to do any more.

393
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,197
History. Now,
that's an appropriate word

394
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,616
because that's what
your sex life is gonna be

395
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,159
if you don't leave him alone.

396
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,370
After all, I know things.

397
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,830
Tiny little pinky-sized details.

398
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,126
Touch him again, and you won't be able
to get as much as a half-ass handjob

399
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,462
from some flag-twirling
colour guard skank.

400
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,756
Bitch, you wouldn't dare.

401
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,591
Try me.

402
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,521
- You OK, babes?
- I'm... fine.

403
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,066
- I'm Fawcett.
- Yeah, I know.

404
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,985
You doing anything after school?

405
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,570
Want to go sip extra-large
low-fat iced coffees

406
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,656
and talk shit about people?

407
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,910
Hey, there, you. I like coffee, too.
I'll come with.

408
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,956
- Ooh! I like decaf.
- How nice for you both.

409
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,377
Well, er, we could all go... together?

410
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,213
Fine. Whatevs. Let's.

411
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,100
So...

412
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,936
So, you're a gay now.

413
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,814
Er, not now. I mean, I've always been.

414
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,858
Just now everybody knows.

415
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,610
Are you gonna audition
for the spring musical?

416
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,114
We're doing The Wiz and we need
as many minorities as we can get.

417
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:10,119
I'm not much for the whole singing
or dancing or being on stage thing.

418
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,789
You sure you're a 'mo?
What gay stuff do you, like, like?

419
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,208
Erm, I'm into comics.

420
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,252
Like Kathy Griffin? She's hilar.

421
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,671
Er, no, like comic books.

422
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,716
That's not gay. That's just lame.

423
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,552
You don't even sound
like the ones on Bravo.

424
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,804
- Say the word "fierce".
- Ooh.

425
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,057
Yeah, I don't really say that word.

426
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,061
Maybe it's like Caprice. She's black,
but she doesn't talk like them.

427
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,064
- Excuse me?
- Well, not all the time.

428
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,776
It's like when we call you a Mormon
but forget the second M.

429
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,528
What about those other losers
you eat lunch with?

430
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,072
They seem way gayer than you.

431
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,200
Oh, no, no, no, no. I heard Brent
is, like, super hetero.

432
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,035
That's why they're all fighting.

433
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,829
That Glenn, though,
he is way too cute to be straight.

434
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,915
Er, Glenn is so not gay. Trust me.

435
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,959
I would know
cos I've got that gaydar thing, right?

436
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,961
But even that Sophie girl,

437
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,798
she's always seemed like
a mucho muncher supreme to me.

438
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,259
I don't think so. I mean,
she hates all the guys at this school,

439
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,969
but she hates all the girls, too.

440
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,680
Well, Tanner, I just want you to know

441
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,350
that I'm totally fine
with your homosexiness.

442
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,976
I mean, it is a sin and all,

443
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,646
but we Mormons
pretty much think everything's a sin,

444
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,815
including those caffeinated beverages.

445
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,733
If you're all gonna burn in hell,

446
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,195
you may as well have a nice time
being queer and stuff while you're here.

447
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,864
Well, that's at least consistent
of you, 'Shley.

448
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,450
I have an amazeballs idea.

449
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,078
This Saturday, why don't you
and me come back here,

450
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,746
and we can totally gay you over?

451
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,375
Oh, and I know all the stylists
at Heroine salon.

452
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,545
I'm sure they can give you something
butchy and Rihanna-esque.

453
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,881
I think he just needs a trim, sweetie,
not a full-blown weave.

454
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,383
These are clips, boo.

455
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,262
Erm, I have a gift card
to Banana Republic that's half full.

456
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,807
Well, perf. I guess
we'll see you both there.

457
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,144
None of them wanted to share

458
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,147
the school's newest
limited-edition status symbol,

459
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,650
and if that meant pretending
to play nice with each other, game on.

460
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,611
That weekend, I quickly discovered

461
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,531
that if I was going to accept
the protection of the in crowd,

462
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,367
- I had some major catching-up to do.
- Where have you been?

463
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,661
I thought we were meeting
at the food court.

464
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,872
- That was, like, four texts ago.
- Come on!

465
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,709
My texts-per-minute average
was extremely subpar.

466
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:26,213
I had about 200 completely unacceptable
photos of myself tagged on Facebook.

00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,260
I can't believe how tight his pants are.

501
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,429
And is he wearing bronzer?

502
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,141
He's spray-Tanner now.

503
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,978
Before, I could move through
the school unnoticed, invisible.

504
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:50,858
But as the GBF, well,
I was kind of indestructible.

505
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,943
The up-close view of 'Topher,

506
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,904
'Shley's hot Mormon boyfriend,
wasn't bad, either.

507
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:01,076
For once, I was actually
kind of enjoying the spotlight.

508
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,667
What do you think you're doing
with that... that ho... ho...

509
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,253
Ho Ho? This is a Twinkie.

510
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,005
Homosexual.

511
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,132
I'm talking about that other twinkie,

512
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,509
your new apparent BFF.

513
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,345
Tanner? He's super nice, actually.

514
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,390
Like, not pure evil at all, really.
I mean, maybe we're wrong.

515
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,727
'Shley, this is not God's plan.

516
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,270
I think that means time out.

517
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,731
This is part of
the polygamists' plot, isn't it?

518
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,192
The pastor always said
it's a slippery slope.

519
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,527
First come the gays.
Then next thing we know,

520
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,322
you people will want multiple
sister-wife prom dates.

521
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,366
Well, I'm taking a stand.

522
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,369
Consider this my resignation
from the O-M-G Club.

523
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,912
I can't be a part of a group

524
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,081
whose leader is in league
with sodomites.

525
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,627
What's a sodomite?

526
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,214
I think it's like dust mite,
but with sod.

527
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,632
Oh.

528
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:00,719
In times of crisis, I turn to Lilo.

529
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:10,270
I mean, I know he's angry at me,
but, like... how could he do this?

530
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,316
Tanner's just doing his best
trying not to get his ass kicked.

531
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,486
- I mean, aren't we all?
- I'm not letting him off that easy.

532
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,322
This literally could not get any worse.

533
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,660
Actually, it can.

534
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,414
You know how the paper

535
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,208
has its prom-court preview issue
coming up?

536
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,461
- Yeah.
- I got a proof.

537
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,174
Tanner is the undisputed front-runner
for prom king this year.

538
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,638
And it's... it's not even close, really.

539
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:49,143
What offends me more than anything
is the hypocrisy and sexism of it all.

540
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,978
If I were to come out as a lesbian,

541
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,440
would I suddenly be a top candidate
for prom queen? I think not.

542
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,317
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

543
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,902
This has got to be a joke.

544
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,988
It's no joke. You're pretty much a lock.

545
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,531
You've got all our votes.

546
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,033
And the votes of our various
minions and mini-mes.

547
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,536
As for queen, they've got us
in a three-way.

548
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,705
- Tie, that is.
- Most kids are undecided.

549
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,332
They're waiting for you
to tell them what to think.

550
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,459
Me?

551
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,421
Everyone knows that 'mos are always way
ahead of what's hot and what's so not.

552
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,256
On a completely unrelated topic,

553
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,051
I made you a batch of my famous yum-yum
double-fudge brownies last night.

554
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,387
'Shley, are you special?
Gays don't do carbs.

555
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,724
Yeah, a carb to a 'mo
is like sunlight to a vampire.

556
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,854
Carbs make gay people sparkle?

557
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,773
I'm thinking maybe we should hang out

558
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,358
just the two of us tonight,
sans C and 'Shley.

559
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,360
Will they be cool with that?

560
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,905
Those bitches can suck it.
I'm so over sharing you.

561
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,325
Psst.

562
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,660
Psst. Hey.

563
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,205
Soledad. Remember me?

564
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,539
How could I forget?

565
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,500
This is an A and gay conversation,

566
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,710
so kindly see your next Tuesday
out of it.

567
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,297
Erm, well, Tanner,
I just wanted to let you know

568
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,133
that there's a GSA meeting
after school, so I thought...

569
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,719
He doesn't want to join
your fag-hag training club.

570
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,721
That is a highly inflammatory term.

571
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,516
I mean, Soledad, you did out me
to the entire school.

572
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,559
Think of the other gay kids
at this school

573
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,270
that are still languishing
in the closet.

574
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,481
You could be a real role model
for them.

575
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,444
That's not my problem.

576
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,783
Hey! So, we heard a vicious rumour

577
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,911
that Fawcett's snagged you
all to herself after school.

578
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,412
Word travels fast.

579
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,541
If that's how we're gonna play it,
I'm calling you Friday

580
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,877
for one-on-one audition prep.
We'll turn the shiz out of The WiZ.

581
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,089
Thursday, you're all mine.
'Topher and I will cook you din-din.

582
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,299
Fawcett had made her move,

583
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,261
but the other queens
weren't going down without a fight.

584
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,263
Friday night is Cameron Woods's party.

585
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,932
We'll all be there,
including 'Shley for some reason.

586
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,227
I'm bringing enough diet caffeine-free
ginger ale for everybody.

587
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,689
Wow. Well, I guess
my week's planned out, then.

588
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,817
Hm-hmm. we've so got you booked, bitch.
Boom.

589
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,491
Wow. This really works.
Or did you prefer the other one?

590
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,577
I'm really not very good at this.

591
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,914
Tanner, I don't actually think that gays
have a heightened sense of fashion.

592
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,041
I'm just asking you
to look at two options

593
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,626
and choose the one you prefer.

594
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,004
I like the one from before.

595
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,381
Those kind of give you '90s mom ass.

596
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:28,302
Ah, thank you! That is just the kind
of bitchy gay insight I'm looking for.

597
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,221
So, the bitchier I am,
the more you'll like me?

598
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,182
Exactly. But don't push it.

599
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:40,272
- You sure have a lot of stuff.
- I know. Don't you love?

600
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,649
I kind of have a thing for labels.

601
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,860
Chanel, Versace,

602
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,696
gay, fiercely fabulous.

603
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,532
- Like you and your comic strips.
- Books.

604
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,827
Whatevs. I'd much rather say hello
to a new handbag

605
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,996
than a friend or boyfriend.

606
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,081
And they're much easier to return.

607
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,417
Is that why you and Hamilton broke up?

608
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:06,465
Now, he is someone who doesn't
understand the value of a label.

609
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:10,093
Somehow me being his girlfriend
meant the whole cheerleading squad

610
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,347
suddenly became
his own personal hookup harem.

611
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,225
- Gross.
- But now I've got you, bitch.

612
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,395
Seriously, though.

613
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,440
I feel like I can be myself around you.

614
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,484
You're not trying to screw me
like a guy.

615
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,487
You're not threatened by me
like every other girl in school.

616
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,032
I guess that's the appeal
of this whole GBF thing.

617
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,868
I'm not sure what I get out of it.

618
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,788
Duh! You get to hang out with me.

619
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,459
OK, erm...

620
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,672
I could help you with
your chemistry homework.

621
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,884
- You're getting a C, right?
- Hmm.

622
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,137
I'm actually kind of brills
when it comes to science-y stuff.

623
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,557
- Really?
- Can you keep a secret?

624
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:04,481
OK, my hair
is only 99.9 percent flawless.

625
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,235
I mix all of my own hair serums
and conditioners in here.

626
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,821
I'll have my own hair-care line one day

627
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,573
on, like, QVC or something,
finally make it big.

628
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,078
That's when I realised
Fawcett was more than just popular.

629
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,539
She was actually kind of cool.

630
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:24,084
Conversions. This is easy.

631
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:30,257
I know you and Tanner had a falling-out,
but you're taking it kind of literally.

632
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,968
Yeah, well, my life is over. So, thanks.

633
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,430
Oh, come on, man. I mean,
you still got the two of us.

634
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:41,184
For about ten minutes.
I never RSVP to a nonstop pity party.

635
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,354
So, I'm bound to eternity
in Loserland with you two. Great.

636
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,023
That's a little harsh.

637
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,567
And here I thought we were
all doing pretty OK,

638
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,527
but I guess we aren't sparkly enough

639
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,113
or have enough synthetic
hair extensions for you.

640
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,823
Sophie, you know what I meant.

641
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,868
No. You know what?
Why don't we take a few days apart.

642
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,912
Maybe without a couple of losers
like us hanging around,

643
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,707
you'll ascend
to your proper social station.

644
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,125
Just be careful, though,

645
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:09,004
because we might not be here
to bandage you up next time you fall.

646
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,423
- Come on, Glenn.
- Sophie!

647
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,760
Erm, yeah. Take it easy, bro.

648
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,513
Glenn. Come on.
We were gonna watch The Voice.

649
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,977
As the wheels
seemed to be coming off

650
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,979
my old friend group, the next day,

651
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,648
I was third-wheeling it, Mormon-style.

652
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,443
Wow. This is a whole lot
of meat, 'Shley.

653
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:35,280
Well, that's what you like,
isn't it? Meat.

654
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,948
Huh?

655
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,284
No carbs. I remembered.

656
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,495
Oh, right. Er, mmm!

657
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,333
Meats with... sides of meats.

658
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,047
Erm, may I use the restroom?

659
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,347
Whoa! What are you doing?

660
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,933
Girl-talk time. So, what do you think?

661
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,309
Think about what?

662
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,312
'Topher. Do you think
he's bored with our relationship?

663
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,107
- I feel like he's bored.
- Erm, I don't know.

664
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,610
I'm worried because we don't,
you know...

665
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,238
- So I need some tips.
- Tips?

666
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,533
You gays are supposed to be experts
in man pleasing. So, spill.

667
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,409
- Er...
- Should I give him a BJ?

668
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,245
- A what?
- Or an HJ?

669
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,538
Or how about an RJ?

670
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:29,084
Er... I don't even know
what an RJ could possibly be.

671
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,795
Me neither.
I was hoping you would.

672
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,673
- Are Mormons even allowed to...?
- What about backdoor?

673
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,675
- Oh, my God!
- Tanner, honey.

674
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,678
Please do not take the Lord's name
in vain in my house.

675
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:44,432
Sorry. I actually did have to pee.
Could we, er, talk later?

676
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:48,728
Fine, but you owe me girl-talk time,
mister, OK?

677
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,736
Oh, Tanner, I am so, so sorry.

678
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,365
'Topher reminded me I have a Junior
Republicans meeting in 20 minutes.

679
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,076
Do you mind if 'Tophie takes you home?

680
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,745
Erm, s-sure, I guess.

681
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,136
'Topher, this isn't my house.

682
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,306
- I know. I just wanted to talk.
- OK.

683
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,057
I've caught you checking me out.

684
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,560
Please don't beat me up!
It won't happen again!

685
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:32,606
Whoa, dude. Whew! Relax.
I find it kind of flattering.

686
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,028
So, what do you like most about me, huh?

687
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,199
What's my sexiest quality?

688
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,451
Oh, I get it. You're one
of those straight guys

689
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,245
who likes to flirt with gay guys
for your own amusement.

690
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,874
- No, that's actually not...
- Contrary to what you might believe,

691
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,211
we homos don't all sit around
pining for straight boys, OK?

692
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:58,506
Some of us like the idea of a guy
actually being turned on by us.

693
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,385
Does this feel straight to you?

694
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,555
Erm, it does, actually.

695
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,226
You Mormons
are a horny, repressed people!

696
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,685
You have no idea.

697
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,064
Wait! This is wrong. You're with 'Shley.

698
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,483
Dude, in two years,
I'm gonna go on my mission.

699
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,526
In four years, I'll probably be married

700
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,112
with a bunch of redheaded rugrats
running around.

701
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,157
So, why don't you just sit back...

702
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,619
. .relax,

703
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,413
and let me get this out of my system?

704
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,419
Ooh.

705
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,965
- You OK?
- Er, th-thanks. I'll walk.

706
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,118
So, I have some news for you.

707
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,036
- It's pretty maj.
- What?

708
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,707
I may have snatched you a prom date.
His name is Christian.

709
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,126
He went to theatre camp with me
last summer.

710
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,629
He's a tenor, a college boy,
and he's British.

711
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,257
- Love it?
- He sounds great.

712
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm just not sure if this
whole prom thing is for me.

713
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,264
OK. You're losing yourself.
Come with Momma.

714
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:36,896
Take a look, Tanner. This is
every prom king and queen since 1983.

715
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,648
You notice anything?

716
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,067
Not the most diverse selection.

717
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,740
Huh. All white, all straight,
all jocks and pom-pom wranglers.

718
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,826
Tanner, we could be the ones
to change all that.

719
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,412
You could be the first
openly gay prom king

720
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,249
and enjoy a hot date to boot,
and I can be the first queen

721
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,918
who's actually deserving
of any notoriety.

722
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,504
So, what do you say?

723
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,340
I get you laid. You get me crowned.

724
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,676
You can lose that virginity
before you snatch up that diploma.

725
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,471
Just because you know
another gay guy doesn't mean...

726
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,057
Whoa!

727
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,810
He's very attractive. Those lips.

728
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,646
Hm-hmm. That's what we call
some high-speed DSLs.

729
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,565
So?

730
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,360
I'll... think about it.

731
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,820
Perf! I'm gonna invite him
to Cameron's tonight

732
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,697
so you two can get to know each other.

733
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,493
- Crap. I forgot that was tonight.
- Relax. It's gonna be V low key.

734
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,377
Everyone can relax.
The people who matter have arrived.

735
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,674
- I'm gonna go see if Christian's here.
- Ooh, there are Christians here?

736
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,302
Get your gay game face on.

737
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,472
After tonight, you'll have
the prom date of your dreams.

738
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:58,561
So, Caprice reeled you in some mangina,
huh? Well played.

739
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,731
I guess. I mean, I don't even know
if he'll like me.

740
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,984
Sounds like you need
some liquid courage. Follow me.

741
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,949
Oh, come on. You call this an ensemble?
Get it together, girl.

742
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,077
Do not call me that.

743
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,790
What? Why?
I meant, like, gurl with a U. Gurl!

744
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,876
Not like you're a... Oh, OK.

745
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,713
Erm, so, hey, why don't we dust this off
and you take me to the mall

746
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,425
and pick me out some eye shadow,
just like the old days.

747
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,052
You're so good with colour.

748
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,931
I don't think I'm leaving the house
till college, but, thanks.

749
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,183
Oh, boo.

750
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:42,188
Listen, I get it. I really do.
With what happened with Tanner,

751
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:47,193
I know that you didn't get to come out
to me in the way that you wanted to.

752
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:52,824
We didn't get to have our extra-special
mother-son lifetime movie moment.

753
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,117
I know that.

754
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:58,872
You don't want to go out tonight, right?
I got a plan B!

755
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:04,836
Did you know that Webflix
has an entire gay and lesbian section?

756
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,883
Blew my mind. OK, Milk. I got Milk.
It's about a gay mayor.

757
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,261
Boys Don't Cry. Now, this is
a girl that wants to be a boy.

758
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,554
That's a tricky one.

759
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,015
Brokeback Mountain. That's the cowboys.

760
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:22,228
And something called Shortballs?
Oh, Shortbus. Shortbus.

761
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,356
So, which one do you want
to pop in first, huh?

762
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,817
Probably the cowboys, right?
That one's safe.

763
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,070
Someone drank
all my ginger ales.

764
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,908
Hey, do you know if there's
caffeine/alcohol in a Chica Loca?

765
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:39,162
No, 'Shley, of course not.
Chug away.

766
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,959
- This was a bad idea.
- There is no getting cold feet now.

767
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:49,464
We have got to rescue Tanner
from those gay-snatching fashion Nazis.

768
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,299
Divide and conquer.

769
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:58,556
Hey, sexy. Don't think me presumptuous
when I say "bottoms up".

770
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,520
This tastes like ass.

771
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,272
- Hm-hmm. Perfect for you.
- Funny.

772
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,274
- Loosen up.
- I hear that's helpful.

773
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,860
There you go.
Look, don't let Caprice pressure you.

774
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,737
If you're really that nervous,

775
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,407
then blow off blowing what's his name
and come to prom as my arm candy.

776
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:20,286
It might be kind of cool to, like,
actually go on a date or something.

777
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,874
PS, this one can has over 600 calories.

778
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,419
I thought carbs
were like gay kryptonite.

779
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,423
Alcohol is the one exception. Duh.
Now down it, bitch.

780
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,592
Whoo!

781
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:39,889
It's freezing cold out there.
Heath! Don't stand on your pride.

782
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,101
Get in the tent with Jake,
for crying out loud.

783
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:47,605
Good. Get in there. Snuggle up.
Snuggle up for warmth. There you go.

784
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,068
Oh. Looks like they're waking back up.
Oh-oh. Here we go.

785
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,778
Game on.

786
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,156
You know, I do sense an affection there.

787
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,201
I mean, you really do feel
they care about one another.

788
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,997
Oh, my. Well, yeah.

789
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,125
I guess necessity
is the mother of invention.

790
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,210
I mean...

791
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,922
It's funny. I guess back then
they didn't even need to use protection.

792
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,425
You know, I'm gonna get a drink.

793
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:19,762
They could have made something out of
some kind of lamb skin or something,

794
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,015
but there probably wasn't time for that.

795
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,475
A few hours
and a lot of drinks later,

796
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,854
I was getting all
the frequently asked questions.

797
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,858
So, with straight guys,
there's ass men and tit men.

798
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,778
But what's the gay equivalent?
Like, ball men?

799
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,364
When you're getting gay with a guy,

800
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,951
how do you decide
who's the girl and who's the boy?

801
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,122
Not an expert,
but I think you're both the boy.

802
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,540
That's kind of the point.

803
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,543
- Just Wiki that shit, freak.
- Leave him alone.

804
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,503
Come on, slut. You owe me a dance.

805
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,966
♪ You do your body work

806
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,094
♪ I feel my pulse working overtime

807
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,222
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry.

808
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,809
Oh. Sorry.

809
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,730
Oh, you guys, I found you! Hi!

810
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,524
- 'Shley.
- Hi.

811
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,693
- Hi.
- Hi.

812
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,362
Hi and bye.

813
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21,032
Is it just me, or is she,
like, the worst Mormon ever?

814
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,534
It's so not just you. She's cray-cray.

815
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,455
Hey! You! Gaysian boy, come here.

816
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,001
Ew! Get out!
We're having gay-guy/girl gab time.

817
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,045
- Seriously?
- Oh, my God.

818
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,464
There's a beanbag
in the other room. Let's go.

819
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,299
- Sorry about this.
- I can't wait.

820
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,717
- Really sorry.
- Bitch.

821
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:43,638
So, your friend Tanner
won't tell me anything about the Js.

822
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,889
The who?

823
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,768
The HJs and the BJs,
pretty much any of the Js.

824
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,230
But I've got an idea.

825
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,648
You are gonna show me how.

826
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,860
And it's not gonna count
because you're like supes gay-mosexual.

827
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,113
- Er, yeah, right.
- Shh!

828
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:06,619
Just pretend I'm, like, some
super-hot guy, like David Archuleta.

829
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,913
David Archuleta? David, don't you worry.

830
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,582
I'm gonna teach you all about
the HJs and the BJs

831
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,085
and the Jay-Zs and the JJ Abrams.

832
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,087
No, wait. Hold on.

833
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,132
You're drunk, plus, you're Mormon,

834
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,135
which totally exacerbates
the whole being-drunk thing.

835
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,888
- Exacerbates. That's a funny word.
- Yeah.

836
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,392
Yeah, anyway, I'm... I'm not even...

837
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,853
- What?
- Gay.

838
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,563
Prove it, Gaysian.

839
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,819
Look who I found!

840
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,781
Sorry. Oh, hi.

841
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,575
You must be...

842
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,994
Christian. Hello, Tanner.

843
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,746
Even better in real life, right?

844
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,373
- Even better with beer goggles.
- Don't touch me.

845
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,042
Damn, you are pretty.

846
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,588
I mean handsome.
I mean pretty handsome.

847
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,926
- Whassup, bro?
- He's usually less special.

848
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,638
Do you want a glass of water
or something, mate?

849
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,392
Oh, hi, there. I hate to break up
this little... whatever this is,

850
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,852
but I need to talk to Tanner.

851
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,397
Tanner can't talk right now.
He and Christian want private moment.

852
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,441
Caprice, we got off on the wrong foot.

853
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,568
Yo, 'Topher, welcome to the casa.

854
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,820
Thank you. Hey, is Tanner here?
I mean 'Shley.

855
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,239
Is 'Shley here?
She's my girlfriend. Love her.

856
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,575
- Yeah. She's in the back.
- OK.

857
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,538
Hey, Glenn.

858
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,791
Oh, my God. Ew, 'Shley.

859
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,918
Glenn, you really are straight?

860
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,172
No, no, he's totes not.
So it doesn't count. Right?

861
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,590
Oh, Jesus Christ.

862
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,634
Caprice, watch your mouth, please.

863
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,594
I could say the same for you, whoremon.

864
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,931
- I think I have to barf.
- I'll hold your hair.

865
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,018
Hey, T. Remember me?

866
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,652
I just ripped it off. I just had to.

867
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:07,448
Tan-pon, I heard you bulimed cuisine
all over a Mormon.

868
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:12,370
I thought I told you
to always drink on an empty stomach.

869
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:16,958
I'm gonna go. I'm kind of over
being the party's gay mascot

870
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:21,587
and of publicly humiliating myself
in front of potential dates.

871
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,800
- You want Mindie to drive you?
- Don't worry. I'm totally sober.

872
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,137
No, thanks. I'll walk.

873
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,015
OK. Call me tomorrow.
Kisses. Mwah!

874
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,726
Oh, my God, you totally made out
with your gay bestie.

875
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,936
No!

876
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,697
Oh, erm...

877
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,450
I... am... drunk.

878
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,870
Me, too.

879
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,297
What are you doing
in front of my house?

880
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,340
I have no clue.

881
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,511
Since I basically have no friends left,

882
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:14,849
my mom decided to have
a queer-movie marathon.

883
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,518
But when we got to Heath and Jake
grunting in a tent,

884
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,312
I started drinking heavily.

885
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:27,320
- You walked all the way over here?
- Hm-hmm.

886
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,740
I had this idea that I'd make
this grand entrance at the party

887
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,951
and make a huge scene,
but this is as far as I got.

888
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,870
Oopsie.

889
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,207
It's not fair!
You get to be belle of the ball,

890
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,960
and I'm stuck home with mommy dearest.

891
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,047
I'd trade places with you in a second.

892
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,759
- Just... Just do me a favour.
- Hmm?

893
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:54,597
When you win prom king,
you'll make a big speech

894
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:59,185
about, you know, everything that
you've learned, you know, very Lohan.

895
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:03,522
Not really my style, but... we'll see.

896
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,907
Sorry. Still picturing you
watching Brokeback with your mom.

897
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,659
It's not funny!

898
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,412
I'm gonna have to emancipate
or something. She's driving me crazy.

899
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,498
She's just being supportive.

900
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,880
Maybe everyone secretly wants a GBF,
even moms.

901
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:36,222
Right now I would just settle for,
like, a BF.

902
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:44,647
You mean like a best friend
or, like, boyfriend?

903
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,276
Either/or.

904
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,488
Or both.

905
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,018
Wait. What?

906
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,270
Oh, my God, no, no.

907
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,148
Did we...? We didn't, right?

908
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,150
- You don't know?
- Do you?

909
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,403
No, no, no. We... We came in,
and we just... We were drunk.

910
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,904
We passed out, I think.

911
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,906
- Right. That sounds right.
- Yeah.

912
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,117
Closet! Now!

913
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,410
- Seriously?
- Gah!

914
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,667
Honey, what was that?

915
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,545
Nothing. I'm just cleaning up in here.

916
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,548
Yeah, it does smell
kind of musky in here.

917
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,718
So, I've got bubbling cinnabons
in the microwave

918
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,678
and some chocolate milk for you.

919
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,180
Super. I'll be right there.

920
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,973
Come on.

921
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,897
- Thanks for that.
- I'm sorry. I'm just not ready.

922
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,942
I don't even know what
I'm doing here. God.

923
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,029
- Wait!
- What?

924
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,032
Could you, er, just go that way?

925
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,243
So, first you want
to put me back in the closet,

926
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,496
and now you want me
to jump out your window?

927
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,122
- Yes.
- Real nice, Tanner.

928
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,584
- I'll make it up to you. I swear.
- Yeah, whatever. It's fine. I get it.

929
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,007
♪ I don't wanna be alright

930
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,136
♪ I don't wanna feel just OK

931
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,932
♪ I wanna see everything

932
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,894
♪ I wanna go everywhere

933
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,395
♪ I wanna settle down

934
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,064
♪ Hey, lover

935
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:53,776
The next Monday,
I still couldn't shake my hangover

936
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:58,906
or what happened between Brent and me.
I mean, what was I thinking?

937
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,867
♪ I don't wanna simplify it

938
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,953
Hey, T. Amazing news.

939
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,039
Christian's willing to forget
about your projectile vomit

940
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,166
and general schwastedness
this weekend.

941
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,544
He's still willing to go
to the prom with you.

942
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,754
- Really? Still?
- Believe it, bitch.

943
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,631
You being the only decent-looking,

944
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,842
age-appropriate gay guy
in a 20-mile radius

945
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,178
has given him a convenient case
of boner-induced amnesia.

946
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:26,934
- He really thinks I'm decent-looking?
- Yeah. Just one condition.

947
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,020
Lay off the cosmo-tini-ritas
on prom night, OK?

948
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,940
- That definitely won't be a problem.
- Yay!

949
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:36,527
This is gonna be so homo-dorable!

950
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,363
Come on, Tan-tut.

951
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,991
Thank you so much.

952
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,953
I'd like to get two tickets to prom.

953
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,705
Oh, OK, then.

954
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,374
Just write down
the name of your date here

955
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,377
- and also her school if she...
- He.

956
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,628
Erm, excuse me?

957
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,006
- He. He.
- Something funny?

958
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,549
No, "he" as in "him".

959
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,469
Pronouns that describe my date,
who is a dude.

960
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,805
Yikes. Sorry.
To get the couple's special,

961
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,349
you need to be a traditional
boy/girl pairing.

962
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,477
- You want me to fight this bitch?
- Sorry, but that's the policy.

963
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,272
Tanner, I just want you to know
that I share your outrage.

964
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,232
- What are we gonna do about this?
- We?

965
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:19,028
I thought you could use the GSA's help
to right this blatant discrimination.

966
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:22,448
That's why our group exists.
Please come to our meeting after school.

967
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,326
Thanks, Solehag,
but we can fight out own battles.

968
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,119
This isn't over.

969
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:33,125
It's just outrageous.
I mean, what is this, 2008?

970
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,710
OK, that's 20. Give me 20 more.

971
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,421
You want to stay a four-pack queer
forever? Let's go!

972
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,883
McKenzie has a different take
on the love-thy-neighbour thing.

973
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,094
And apparently you can't get
enough of that neighbour lovin'.

974
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,805
McKenzie Price is deceased socially
at this school.

975
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,767
I've already got the Facebook post
composed.

976
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,436
But that defeats the purpose.

977
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,231
I think I'm gonna go
to the GSA meeting after school.

978
00:53:56,483 --> 00:54:00,444
No. Soledad and her little group?
It'll totally downgrade your rep.

979
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,989
Those busted bitches were the ones
that dragged you out of the closet.

980
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,033
Remember? You know what my advice is?

981
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,327
Just buy the stag tickets
and get the F over it.

982
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,788
Don't say you're seriously
considering this.

983
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,624
What have I got to lose?
I mean, they outed me,

984
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:17,628
but at least their intentions
were kind of noble, I guess.

985
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,756
And let me just say, if you guys
really claim to be my friends,

986
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,299
you could focus a little less

987
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,760
on how much I match your outfit
on any given day

988
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,554
and show some concern
for my freaking equal rights!

989
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:36,689
PS, are my arms looking
Michelle Obama toned or Madonna scary?

990
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,609
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Have you heard about Tanner?

991
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,529
What? What did... I didn't...
What did you hear?

992
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,740
Apparently he totally threw down
with McKenzie Price over prom.

993
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,826
He was all,
"I'm taking a dude as my date."

994
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,452
She was all, "Not on my watch."

995
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,580
He was all, "We'll see about that,
you c-word-face mofo ho."

996
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,918
Hold that, Wonton.
Tanner wants to ask a guy to prom?

997
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:02,506
Yeah. I have no idea who, though.
Hey, maybe he met someone.

998
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,137
- No one I can think of.
- Me neither.

999
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,597
See ya.

1000
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,766
First order of business, GSA-ers,

1001
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,353
I'd like to introduce
our first actually gay member,

1002
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,397
Tanner Daniels! Whoo!

1003
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,441
Welcome, bro dude.

1004
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,402
Good to have another member
with a member representing.

1005
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,239
Right. Well, I'm just here because
I was trying to buy prom tickets, and...

1006
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,576
And he couldn't
because of our school's unjust,

1007
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,661
totally outdated prom-date policies.

1008
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,830
So, what are we
gonna do about this?

1009
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,206
We?

1010
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:42,796
Yeah. I am joining the GSA
to support my GBF. Move.

1011
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,465
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Erm...

1012
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:48,302
Fawcett, thank you,
but, erm, we're at capacity,

1013
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,095
so we don't really...

1014
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,849
Soledad, the GSA is open
to anyone who wants to join.

1015
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,977
But, Ms Hoegel,
this is my thing, you know?

1016
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,271
She has things, lots of things,

1017
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,858
and she's trying to take my... my, er...

1018
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,568
- She's...
- Are you quite done?

1019
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,572
- Can we please...
- Just one moment.

1020
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:14,661
I've noticed some disturbing trends
in this school as of late.

1021
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,706
It seems that many of you girls
are treating Tanner

1022
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,710
as more of a prize to be won
than an actual person.

1023
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,255
Ms Hoegel, that's ridiculous. Right, T?

1024
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,301
Listen, girls. I get the appeal.

1025
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,347
Now, I myself had
a gay best friend once and...

1026
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:37,434
Oh, we were room-mates
for many fruitful years.

1027
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,146
But now he's no longer with us.

1028
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,820
- Oh.
- Oh, damn.

1029
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,196
What? Where'd he go?

1030
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,657
He obvi died of the hivs, dumb-ass.

1031
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:56,286
Oh, God, no! He moved to San Diego
with a leather queen.

1032
00:56:56,371 --> 00:57:01,417
I meant myself and my cat...
Anderson Coo-purr.

1033
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,379
Oh, my God.

1034
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:10,384
We're very happy, Mr Coo-purr and I.

1035
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,386
What do we do about this prom situation?

1036
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,306
If you can't take your boy toy to prom,
I will lead a school-wide boycott,

1037
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:22,604
and if they don't meet my,
I mean our, demands,

1038
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:26,733
then I will just host
my own cooler alterna-prom.

1039
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,777
Fawcett, you'd do that?

1040
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,698
I mean, prom's your night.
You're a shoo-in for prom queen.

1041
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,742
Come on. What's the point of being queen

1042
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,370
when I don't have a fabulous king
to share it with?

1043
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,375
You know, Soledad, you have done
such a great job with this group,

1044
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,379
but I think it's time that some things
actually changed around this school.

1045
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,756
Who's with me?

1046
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,133
Whoo!

1047
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,765
- Hey, Tanner, looking good.
- Hey. Thanks.

1048
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,603
WTF, T? I secure you
a date with the hottest teen homo

1049
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:06,773
in the Tri-State area, and that jizz bin
still gets your endorsement?

1050
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,486
What? But I didn't ever... What?

1051
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,656
"Tanner Daniels endorsed Fawcett Brooks
yesterday at the GSA meeting."

1052
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,617
"The new power BFs known as..."

1053
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,203
T-Fawce. Cute, isn't it?

1054
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,956
You really think another bland blonde
like her deserves the crown, Tanner?

1055
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,959
Well, at least she stands up
for my... my rights or whatever.

1056
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,379
This hack-tivist doesn't give
a flying fairy about gay rights.

1057
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,673
She just did it to gain
the advantage with you.

1058
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,926
Like you did with that
male-bait Christian?

1059
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,303
Whatever! At least I tried
to bribe him with sex.

1060
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,388
I treated him like an actual human being

1061
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,807
and not some asexual,
neutered purse puppy.

1062
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,977
I've had enough bad-dinner-theatre
dramatics for one day.

1063
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,898
- We've got a revolution to plan.
- Do not come for my craft, bitch!

1064
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,609
Do not come for my bitch, bitch!

1065
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:58,575
Yeah, it sounds great.
Right. Promise. No drinks for me.

1066
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,577
See you then, dude.

1067
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,667
- Hey.
- What's up?

1068
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,252
Not much.

1069
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,796
You're making
quite the stank over prom,

1070
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,007
joining the GSA,
endorsing your new bestie.

1071
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:18,345
I didn't endorse anyone.
I just... It's not fair.

1072
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,472
We should be treated like everyone else.

1073
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,351
We? I mean, you got to ask me first.

1074
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,479
What are you talking about?

1075
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,398
You and me. Prom.

1076
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,151
Er...

1077
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,947
Caprice set up this thing
with her friend. I just...

1078
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:40,242
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said anything
about us going to prom together?

1079
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,868
Just that...

1080
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:46,248
No, I was saying, like,
if you wanted a friend to go with,

1081
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:51,336
but, like, obviously you got
that, you know, taken care of, so...

1082
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,507
You know, I hope your Prince Charming
gives you everything you want.

1083
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,718
And also crabs.

1084
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,566
I got your Facebook message.

1085
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,611
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

1086
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,032
Does your vocal coach know you smoke?

1087
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:27,831
Look, we all know you're gayer
than a very special episode of Glee.

1088
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,166
I am not!

1089
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,044
What's your point?

1090
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,631
Well, I need a minion,
and you need a diva to worship.

1091
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:39,051
With Tanner and Fawcett
heading up this fey prom,

1092
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,262
that leaves an opportunity
for me to be the queen of the real one.

1093
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,183
So, how would you like to be
my date, maybe even my king?

1094
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:53,190
Alright, if you still need convincing,
check out a pic of Tanner's prom date.

1095
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,983
He can do better, but I'm in.

1096
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,908
Hi, there. Caprice, you said you had
something you wanted to talk about?

1097
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,785
I do.

1098
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,249
- Love your cloak.
- Thanks.

1099
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,630
Support traditional prom-going values.

1100
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,759
Buy tickets to the official
school-sanctioned prom.

1101
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,638
Attend the prom by students,
for all students.

1102
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,100
Can I have one, please?

1103
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,226
No.

1104
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,770
Sorry. You're not on our list
of approved students.

1105
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,896
What?

1106
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,066
This being an indie operation,
we've got very limited space.

1107
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,360
I'm sure Caprice's
old-fashioned loser dance

1108
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,654
has plenty of tickets available.
Thank you.

1109
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,699
Fawcett, what the hell was that?

1110
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:47,369
Tan, if we want to pull off this
whole gay-inclusive-prom thing,

1111
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:50,747
we're gonna have to keep it
kind of exclusive.

1112
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:55,460
Look, I didn't make up these rules,
but a fugly prom is a failed prom.

1113
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,338
So wrong.

1114
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,257
You smell great.

1115
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,261
Thank you.

1116
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,888
I told you. This is crazy.

1117
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:11,226
It's like freaking high-school
Game of Thrones out here or something.

1118
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,480
Sorry, Ellen Jr, but you can't take
your poor man's Portia to this dance.

1119
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,940
Try the pro-sodomy prom.

1120
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,401
You do know that oral
counts as sodomy, right?

1121
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:22,696
So, with the amount of going
down that goes down at prom,

1122
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,991
you might want to rethink
the concept. Right, Brent?

1123
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,369
By the way, did they change
the official prom song

1124
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,413
to Trapped In the Closet just for you?

1125
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,707
Nice try, lies-bian,
but I know for a fact

1126
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,251
that my boo Brent
is as straight as they come.

1127
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,755
Like Kanye or Diddy or Tyler Perry.

1128
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,381
Whatev...

1129
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,593
. .er. Whatever.

1130
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:48,180
The full word. I said it all.

1131
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:52,642
'Tophie,
I want to go to cool prom.

1132
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:57,397
Hey, 'Shley, you know Caprice calls you
a ginger-snatch behind your back, right?

1133
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,484
- She does?
- Well, Fawcett said your religion

1134
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,779
is just Scientology without
birth control or famous people.

1135
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:08,700
Well, you know what?
F you both.

1136
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,453
She'll be fine.

1137
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:15,290
And we'll take two tickets to
the 100 percent totally ungay prom.

1138
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,000
Thank you.

1139
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,587
Hmm. Cute shorts.

1140
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,589
And you.

1141
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,758
I hear you and Spigot here

1142
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,844
are denying certain
less-than-favourable people tickets.

1143
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:31,681
Relax, So-fat. You and Memoirs
Of a Gauy Nerd are allowed to come.

1144
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:35,060
I'm giving you a temporary pass
to the cool kids' table.

1145
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,521
We wouldn't come
if you paid us, Fawcett.

1146
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,898
Or should I say fascist?

1147
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:44,778
- It's your social funeral, sweetie.
- I'll start mourning now.

1148
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:48,573
So-fat! I mean, Sophie! Damn it! Wait!

1149
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:56,164
You know what? You both
have become so much more

1150
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,960
than these bitches' sexless accessories.

1151
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:05,882
You've become full-blown tools,
in every sense of the word.

1152
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,927
Oh.

1153
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,643
Tanner. Tanner.

1154
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,272
Tanner! Tanner!

1155
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:25,110
Tanner! What is your deal?

1156
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,653
I can't do this any more!

1157
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:30,073
Excuse me? The last I checked,
this was all for you.

1158
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,366
Is it?

1159
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,244
I actually started to believe
that you were my friend.

1160
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:37,289
But what is this, really?
Am I just some tool to you,

1161
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,876
a wrench so that you can screw
over Caprice and 'Shley?

1162
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,129
Wrenches don't screw things.
God, you are gay.

1163
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,048
But you're right.

1164
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,343
Look, at first I just wanted
to keep you to myself.

1165
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,012
After Hamilton dumped me...

1166
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,599
Yeah, it's true, he dumped me.

1167
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,311
I thought I needed you
by my side to win.

1168
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,146
But it's different now.

1169
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,191
I really like hanging out with you...
for real.

1170
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:09,446
Then why create a separate prom?
You're gonna win queen no matter what.

1171
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,281
Don't be so sure.

1172
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,203
I took a peek at the polling data.
I rule with the popular kids,

1173
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,706
but the other 90 percent,
the rest of the school,

1174
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,167
just think I'm a soulless bitch.

1175
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:26,838
I mean, they'd rather vote for 'Shley.
At least she's nice.

1176
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,050
Caprice, she's got talent.

1177
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,510
What have I got?

1178
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:40,852
- You have me.
- Really?

1179
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,398
You're more than what people see
on the surface,

1180
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,651
and you're the only one
who stood up for me

1181
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:51,613
when it really mattered,
so let's make a compromise.

1182
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,949
You let everyone come
to the alterna-prom,

1183
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:57,202
and I'll make sure
that you get that crown. Deal?

1184
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,121
Yeah.

1185
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:09,089
Thanks, all of you, for helping
to keep our prom gayness-free.

1186
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:14,344
So, I'm thinking, activity-wise,
how about a promise-ring booth?

1187
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,179
So charming. Love it.

1188
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,765
Promise rings for prom. Cute.

1189
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,017
I've got
a bit of a different plan.

1190
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,185
Listen up, ladies.

1191
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,939
Tanner and Fawcett are poaching all the
cool kids for their little pansy prom.

1192
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:29,734
If we don't act quick, we won't have
enough people for a decent hokey pokey.

1193
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:35,615
What we need to do
is start prom-oting prom.

1194
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,075
You feel me?

1195
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,911
- Amazing.
- Whoo! Yeah!

1196
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:46,459
Hmm. Don't you think this might
be a bit over the top, Brent?

1197
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,212
I'm just fighting flamers
with flame.

1198
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,809
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

1199
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:07,313
Relax, dude. I just wanted to tell you
how much I admire your passion.

1200
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:11,026
You're really... organised.

1201
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,696
When I heard about Tanner going to prom
with that other dude,

1202
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,614
I was totally grossed out, too.

1203
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,035
Right, bro? I mean, like,
two dudes, like...

1204
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,662
- Ugh. Ick.
- Yeah.

1205
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:28,835
So, erm, do you want to feel
how straight I am?

1206
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,047
Come again?

1207
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,302
Is this actually happening
or is this a dream?

1208
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,345
I just changed my sheets yesterday.

1209
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,431
- No, it's real, bro.
- Oh, my God.

1210
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,892
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How did you know?

1211
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,353
- I mean, did Tanner tell you?
- No, dude, I figured it out myself.

1212
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:51,316
Tanner won't even look at me
since I tried to get with him.

1213
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,443
Wait. What am I doing?
No, no way, no.

1214
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:56,112
I cannot have Tanner's
rejected sloppy seconds.

1215
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,739
I have too much self-respect.

1216
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:02,077
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
some anti-gay prom posters to finish.

1217
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:10,335
So close. Goddamn it!

1218
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,838
I am so sorry.

1219
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:19,427
"Prom is short for promenade,
not prom-n-Aids."

1220
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,097
No one but Brent
could come up with a pun

1221
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,974
that simultaneously lame
and offensive.

1222
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,811
I told you, he has officially lost it.

1223
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:31,689
What the shit were you thinking?
This language is unacceptable!

1224
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,817
Principal Crowe, as a devout Mormon,

1225
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:37,445
I think the signs are all totally true
and appropriate.

1226
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:40,907
Oh, in what universe
would "boutonnieres, not butt sex"

1227
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,243
be appropriate for a prom slogan?

1228
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,246
Yeah, and "no tossing salads"?

1229
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,582
I got cafeteria ladies coming in here
asking me if I changed the menu!

1230
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:54,087
I've got news organisations
calling me, not to mention the ACLU.

1231
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,756
- Facebook!
- People are tweeting about this!

1232
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,425
We... We weren't thinking.

1233
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,846
Well, I'm particularly disappointed
in you, Mr Van Camp.

1234
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,264
I expected more of you.

1235
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,307
I was thinking about suspending you all.

1236
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,894
Instead I'm just gonna cancel prom.

1237
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,105
Wait, no! You can't do that!

1238
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,440
Wait! That'll turn us
into social pariahs.

1239
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,985
That's not fair.
You're not cancelling their prom.

1240
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,320
That prom is out
of Crowe's jurisdiction.

1241
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,698
Its organisers
haven't been promoting hate.

1242
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:25,743
Get out of here before I change
my mind about the suspensions.

1243
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,956
- Terrific restraint.
- Thank you.

1244
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:39,883
Well, Tanner, looks like
we've now got the only game in town.

1245
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,719
Though, Brent, I have to
give you some props.

1246
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:46,306
Those signs were pretty hilar.
Later, later.

1247
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,432
Sorry.

1248
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,101
Onward, Christian soldiers.

1249
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,686
They want to cancel our prom?

1250
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,732
Then we will organise a protest
of their deviant dance of debauchery.

1251
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,233
She's right, B.

1252
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,903
The whole me-being-prom-queen ship
has sailed.

1253
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,198
But take it from an actress,
if we can't be in the spotlight,

1254
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:06,242
we can sure make
one hell of a scene.

1255
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,786
Family values!

1256
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,872
Family values!

1257
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,707
Family values! Family...

1258
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,792
'Tophie, how could you?

1259
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,503
Those signs that you made
were just so, so mean.

1260
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:20,173
Babe, I was just trying
to protect our relationship.

1261
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,926
Congratulations.
You just did the opposite.

1262
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,636
We are so done-zo.

1263
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,974
Hmm.

1264
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,478
- How's it going, guys?
- Oh, fantastic.

1265
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,940
We've devised a genius way
to take Tan Lines down a few notches.

1266
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,983
And knock Fawce-slut off her horse high.

1267
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,861
OK, while you crazy Christians
are outside protesting,

1268
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,864
Caprice and I will infiltrate the prom
in killer ensembles.

1269
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,032
James Bond. Hello.

1270
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,742
The moment that Tanner and Fawcett

1271
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:51,371
are crowned king and queen,
we douse them with this.

1272
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:55,250
It'll be very Stephen King's Carrie
meets Mariah Carey's Glitter.

1273
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,834
Tanner will hate it.

1274
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,463
In fourth grade, I accidentally spilled
glitter on him in arts and crafts.

1275
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:02,090
He didn't talk to me for a month.

1276
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:05,260
It's the longest he and I
have ever gone without speaking,

1277
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,719
you know, until now.

1278
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:10,348
And Fawcett will be picking it out of
her prized goldilocks for months.

1279
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,142
With any luck, she'll have to
shave it back like Britney.

1280
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,270
Yeah! I love it!

1281
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,563
- Great scheming, guys.
- Thanks.

1282
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:21,818
I'm so glad we're friends now, Caprice.
I've always wanted an SBF.

1283
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,236
An SBF?

1284
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,321
Sassy black friend. Duh.

1285
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,577
As Brent and Caprice plotted,

1286
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:35,999
I realised I had my own
unfinished business to take care of.

1287
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,626
Hey. I mean, hey.

1288
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,921
I've got something to say.

1289
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,300
Tanner, honey, what is it?
You need a snack.

1290
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,677
No, Shannon, I'm not hungry.

1291
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:50,930
I, erm... I've got something
to tell you both,

1292
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,141
and I don't care if you like it or not.

1293
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,979
- Tanner?
- Honey, what is it?

1294
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,566
I, erm...

1295
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,652
So, I'm not actually going to the prom
with Fawcett tomorrow.

1296
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,948
I mean, she's driving me,
but I've got another date.

1297
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,036
A boy. I like boys.

1298
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:16,164
Well, I mean, not boys.

1299
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:20,043
Like, gross. Men. Like, men.
Like, men my own age.

1300
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:22,086
And so did Abraham Lincoln.

1301
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,963
I read that somewhere.

1302
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,341
And he was, like,
the best Republican ever,

1303
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:31,512
so you should probably say something
before I keep saying more things.

1304
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,810
Tanner, we know.

1305
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:41,814
Y-You what?

1306
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,900
We know.

1307
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,735
And it's OK.

1308
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,364
Although your claims
about Abraham Lincoln

1309
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,408
I don't think
are entirely substantiated.

1310
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,659
Tanner, sweetie,

1311
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:57,497
you haven't been completely consistent
in clearing the internet history.

1312
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,416
We've seen... some stuff.

1313
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:04,587
Word. We have seen some stuff.
I mean, who knew that that even...

1314
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:09,926
Anyway, so, you're 100 percent
completely allergic to the lady parts.

1315
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,636
That's fine!

1316
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,012
- Who cares?
- It's OK.

1317
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,640
I-I could be bi.

1318
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,059
Yeah, right!

1319
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,644
Of course you can.

1320
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:26,651
OK, well, erm,
so, good, I guess, then.

1321
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,153
I'm... I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

1322
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,323
Tanner, honey, do you need a snack?
You're skinny.

1323
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:36,411
He could be bi. Coastal.

1324
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,582
Prom! Let's do this!

1325
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,252
Oh, that's cute.

1326
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,797
Oh, that's so prom. Yes.

1327
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,771
- Girl, you look great.
- Hey, girl.

1328
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:08,109
- I was talking to my son.
- Thank you.

1329
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,071
Ready?

1330
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,157
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

1331
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,950
♪ Don't you think it's time

1332
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:21,706
♪ For you and me to make some history?

1333
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,959
- ♪ Tell me now what you say
- Cheese!

1334
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,379
♪ We can take anything

1335
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:34,677
Caprice, I'm impressed.
I mean, you look very convincing.

1336
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,143
♪ When times are hard,
we'll smile and say

1337
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,062
♪ We're not afraid of anything

1338
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,274
♪ Cos we feel young and wild

1339
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:49,942
♪ I believe

1340
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,612
Darling, can I just...? I just want...

1341
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:54,322
Listen, I just wanted to say

1342
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,366
that I don't know what, you know,
all this is and I don't...

1343
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,870
Whatever...
Whatever you want to call yourself.

1344
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:07,919
I mean, the bottom line is
your mom loves you very much,

1345
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:13,341
like crazy a lot, like to the point
where it's really kind of ridiculous.

1346
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,927
It's almost embarrassing. A lot.

1347
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,513
So, please just know that, darling.

1348
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,058
Thanks. I love you, too.

1349
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,060
Oh, gosh, honey. Thank you so much.

1350
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:27,021
Here, I don't want... I don't want
to smudge your makeup.

1351
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:29,190
. .Shall surely be put to death!

1352
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:34,529
Prepare ye... for the infidels.

1353
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:40,451
Finally. Where have you been?
And why are you wearing that?

1354
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,913
You're baling on me
to go after that latter-day skank.

1355
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:47,792
'Shley dumped 'Topher
and needs a GBF to escort her to prom.

1356
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:52,797
She still seems to think that I'm gay,
despite our little dry-humping session.

1357
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,841
The indignities and humiliations
a guy will go through

1358
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,802
just for some Mormon ginge-muff.

1359
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,514
You really are a flaming heterosexual.

1360
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:04,892
Guilty! Seriously, Sophe,
can you do me a huge favour

1361
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,436
and cover prom for the Gazette?

1362
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:08,813
- No.
- Come on! Please.

1363
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:12,275
You, of all people, know that
this insanity needs to be documented.

1364
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:16,112
And, er, well,
I might have my hands full.

1365
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:19,907
I am not paying Aqua-valve one cent
to get into her sham of a dance.

1366
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,577
Comped press passes.

1367
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,372
Fine, but I'm only going
if there are appetisers.

1368
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:28,165
Yes!

1369
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,543
- Don't hug me.
- Come on.

1370
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,300
Aww!

1371
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:40,011
- You're doing it again.
- What?

1372
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,888
That noise girls make when
they see two gay guys together.

1373
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:45,224
Yeah, it's the same
annoying sound people make

1374
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,852
when they see cute animals
dressed in human clothes.

1375
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,022
Ew, gross. Barf. Is that better?

1376
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,857
Much.

1377
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,403
You're all gonna burn!
Think of your soul you're defiling!

1378
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,904
Ever read the Bible?

1379
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,908
"Do not lie with a man as one lies
with a woman. It is an abomination."

1380
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:06,912
- Abomination!
- You're all going to hell!

1381
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:15,880
That's right, bitches. I'm upstaging
you all with double the 'mo.

1382
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,049
And this one's imported.

1383
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,702
Take my picture!
Please take my picture!

1384
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:24,740
Caprice. Brent. Funny seeing you here.

1385
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:26,992
Welcome.

1386
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,538
We've seen the error of our ways.
We can't wait to see you both crowned.

1387
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:33,666
You guys really deserve it. Truly.

1388
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,710
See, guys? It all worked out.

1389
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,503
We all have our very own GBF.

1390
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:40,381
Actually, we're not all GBFs.

1391
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:42,633
Right.
Brent's 100 percent grade-A hetero.

1392
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,261
Sure he is.

1393
01:18:58,358 --> 01:18:59,942
Well, hey, there, prom date.

1394
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,152
Hey.

1395
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,904
So, is this not the lamest thing ever?

1396
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,241
I didn't know we were gonna be
your girlfriend's matching corsages.

1397
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:10,828
I know, right?
Sorry about that.

1398
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:12,580
Do you want to get out of here?

1399
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:16,250
I know a place where we could...
get to know each other.

1400
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,377
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

1401
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,589
I just feel like I should really
stay here for Fawcett's sake.

1402
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:22,882
- Tanner.
- She's like...

1403
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,550
- Tanner.
- . .really fragile.

1404
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,719
- Tanner.
- And... Hmm?

1405
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,765
I get it. You're not there yet.

1406
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,643
So, if you don't mind,
I'm... I'm gonna bounce.

1407
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,146
OK.

1408
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,735
- Night.
- Sure.

1409
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:57,500
". .For this is how the nations I am
driving out before you became defiled."

1410
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:59,460
Nice!

1411
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:02,922
"I came to punish
and it has vomited out its inhabitants."

1412
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:04,048
See ya.

1413
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:10,805
What are you doing?

1414
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:15,392
I feel a monster stress zit coming on.
You know when you can feel it coming

1415
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,436
and there's nothing you can do
to stop it?

1416
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,687
Let me look.

1417
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,066
OK, well, I do see it.

1418
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,902
The good news is
it won't surface for a few hours.

1419
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,445
Thanks.

1420
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,864
But if things run late with Posh Spice,

1421
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,575
he might have to learn
to love you, zits and all.

1422
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,621
Not gonna happen. He baled.

1423
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:38,707
I guess I spent all this time
being a GBF

1424
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:42,002
and never actually learned
how to be a real, live gay.

1425
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:45,506
Well, it sounds to me
like he doesn't deserve you.

1426
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:53,222
I just miss you guys so much.

1427
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:58,894
I can't believe I ditched you.
I don't know what happened to me.

1428
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:01,272
I just got scared.

1429
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,234
Not to mention blinded by the flash
of bleached teeth and hair?

1430
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:06,735
Tanner?

1431
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:11,282
Our crowning moment
is only minutes away.

1432
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,956
Great tunes, great tunes.

1433
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,000
OK, hello there, ladies and gentlemen,

1434
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,252
and, er, everything in between.

1435
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:25,713
This is it, babes. This is our moment.

1436
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,173
T-Fawce is gonna dominate.

1437
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:36,181
This is it, our moment.
T-Fawce is gonna eat it.

1438
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,350
We make a good team, B.

1439
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,436
It is my pleasure to announce

1440
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:48,444
this year's prom king and queen
of North Gateway's first "LGBTQA

1441
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:52,156
and every other letter you
can think of" inclusive prom.

1442
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,075
So, without further ado...

1443
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,082
. .our trailblazing couple is...

1444
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,543
. .T-Fawce!

1445
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,631
Tanner and Fawcett!

1446
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:11,675
Wow.

1447
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:19,391
Congratulations. Well deserved.

1448
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:21,644
Let me know when you think
they're in position.

1449
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:24,104
- Congratulations.
- We love you, Tanner.

1450
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,691
Thank you. Oh, my goodness.
This is such a surprise.

1451
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:31,403
- Fawcett, I want to say something.
- OK.

1452
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,322
You're fierce!

1453
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:36,283
This is for you.

1454
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:40,955
- Wait. Give him a second.
- We love you, T-Fawce!

1455
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:47,044
Look, er, thanks, everyone,
for making me king of this gay prom.

1456
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:50,172
Oh, my God, he's doing it.
He's going full Lohan.

1457
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:54,760
I don't want to be king of the gay prom

1458
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:59,848
or be a gay best friend
or get gay-married.

1459
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:04,395
I just want to go to prom,

1460
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,147
be a friend,

1461
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,066
get married, maybe.

1462
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:13,362
You all see me more
as an object or a symbol.

1463
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,657
I guess I've been guilty of that myself.

1464
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:21,537
I used my friends
as shields to hide behind.

1465
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:27,042
I had friends who cared about me...

1466
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,879
. .whether I was gay or whatever.

1467
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:38,762
And I had a best friend
who I shared everything with.

1468
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:40,806
And all I want is...

1469
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,559
I mean, I'd give anything

1470
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:47,396
to just be his loyal sidekick again.

1471
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,819
Thank you very much.

1472
01:23:57,782 --> 01:24:00,826
Well, that's just sweeter
than a pug in a sundress.

1473
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,119
Oh, no!

1474
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,127
Oh, my God!

1475
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,473
Hmm!

1476
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,810
Brent! Jesus, are you OK?

1477
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:31,023
Thought you could upstage me
with a classic "what I learned" speech?

1478
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,858
Amateur!

1479
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:35,027
So, Brent burst
out of the closet

1480
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:38,155
in an explosion of glitter,
just like he always wanted,

1481
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,032
and I got my best friend back.

1482
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:43,911
- Caprice, mission accomplished?
- Er, not yet.

1483
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:49,374
OK, y'all made your point. I made mine.
Now we all have a choice.

1484
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:51,668
You can stay out here,
bored out of your minds

1485
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,254
and freezing your asses off
with this crazy bitch.

1486
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:58,133
Or you can come inside and dance
your asses off with this crazy bitch.

1487
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:00,052
Do you really want to go heaven

1488
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,888
if it's filled with nothing
but psychos like her?

1489
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:06,350
That's what I thought.

1490
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,060
OK, let's go.

1491
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:10,854
Suit yourselves! Run toward damnation!

1492
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,065
I'll see you all in hell!

1493
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,859
I mean, I won't see you
cos I won't be there,

1494
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,570
but there's probably, like,
a window or something

1495
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:22,199
where people in heaven
can look down to people in hell!

1496
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:26,537
And I'll see you through
that hell window... thing!

1497
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,040
That sucks, man.

1498
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:33,877

01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,400
So, I went down in history

1506
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,527
as the first kid in our school
to come out,

1507
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:01,405
but I definitely wasn't the last
because, as it turns out,

1508
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:04,741
the closet and high school
are kind of the same thing.

1509
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,536
They're both something
you can't wait to escape

1510
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,122
but are scared to death
of what lies beyond.

1511
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:14,334
They both make you kind of insane,
cause you to take on a secret identity

1512
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,212
or make you confused

1513
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,089
or mean...

1514
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:22,843
or crazy horny, even.

1515
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,762
- Sweet Joseph Smith, you are sexy.
- You, too.

1516
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:29,725
You're out, right?

1517
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:34,021
For a face like yours, I'll out myself
to the entire Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

1518
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,065
When you're in,
every little thing

1519
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:40,235
just seems like the hugest deal,
but once you're out, well,

1520
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,487
you wonder why
you ever made such a fuss.

1521
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:45,782
And while things still suck
every once in a while,

1522
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:50,120
when you finally leave
both the closet and high school,

1523
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,498
everything just kind of... sucks less.

1524
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:57,085
- So, now that you're out...
- I am?

1525
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,964
What about us?

1526
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,759
- Us?
- Hm-hmm.

1527
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:06,178
- Well, I just...
- I was...

1528
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:08,597
What? No, you go first.

1529
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,225
- I was thinking...
- Hm-hmm.

1530
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:15,312
- . .You know, if we ended up together...
- Which we totally would

1531
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,940
if this were a classic
high-school movie.

1532
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:21,235
Right, and, you know, but we
don't get to kiss as the credits roll.

1533
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:24,738
Well, we got to,
you know, keep going.

1534
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:26,782
Maybe we'd last a few months.

1535
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:27,991
- Right.
- A year.

1536
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,118
And then what?
Then we go to college

1537
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:34,331
and then I cheat on you
and it's awkward and I lose you forever.

1538
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:37,459
So, what you're saying is,

1539
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:42,005
instead of satisfying
our teenage horniness...

1540
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:48,011
Instead of risking having you as my BF,

1541
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:51,640
I'd rather keep you forever as my BFF.

1542
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:55,560

had made his gayness official,

'Shley and Glenn won cutest couple
when he came out as irrefutably straight

1545
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,410
and she came out as a total rice queen.

1546
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,204
But it took us a bit longer
to convince Fawcett to come out

1547
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:17,749
as a chemistry nerd
with a secret nice streak.

1548
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:18,917
Oh, my God!

1549
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,461
Sophie won a scholarship
to Sarah Lawrence

1550
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,880
after she published
a well-regarded analysis

1551
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,342
of the adolescent propensity
for self-perpetuated objectification.

1552
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,430
And Brent and Caprice
were voted most dramatic,

1553
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:36,143
which, let's face it, is basically
short-hand for gayest and bitchiest.

1554
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:40,564
As for me, I didn't win
any senior superlatives.

1555
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:44,192
With all the new outings going on,
my sex life, or lack thereof,

1556
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:47,321
was once again
the least interesting thing about me.

1557
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:52,659
I wasn't an accessory or a sidekick.
I was just me.

1558
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,703
And I couldn't have been gayer about it.

1559
01:28:54,787 --> 01:28:57,039
And I mean that
in the old-timey, happy way,

1560
01:28:57,123 --> 01:29:01,251
not the gay way,
