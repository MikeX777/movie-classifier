1
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,875
Hey, you, get the hell out of there.

2
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,375
It is an honor and a privilege
to present to you

3
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,708
the gentleman from whose generosity
this center came to be.

4
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,250
Ladies and gentlemen, Jack Gardner.

5
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:48,166
Uh… I am thrilled to be part of this
wonderful project, dedicated to fun…

6
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,333
…and for the better education of children…

7
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,500
…to developing
their creativity and artistic skills

8
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:00,500
and to create for them
an atmosphere of joy and hope,

9
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,458
a positive place for…

10
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,375
…a positive place for a child to grow.

11
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,458
Oh… Thank you.

12
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,708
Hello, Mama? It's me, Valerie.

13
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,666
How are you?

14
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,291
Your cold, is it gone?

15
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,458
I'm so glad.

16
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,875
I'm great.

17
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,916
I'm meeting wonderful people, and…

18
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,916
I found this really great apartment,
and I'm eating good.

19
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,875
Don't worry about me, Mama.

20
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,708
I have nowhere to go but up.

21
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,541
I give it a real good sweep, twice a day,
morning and afternoon.

22
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,875
I live right there down the street.

23
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,041
I have my own broom.

24
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,666
Ten dollars.

25
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,208
And I can use your bathroom
to brush my teeth and clear up.

26
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,458
All right.

27
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,541
A shower?

28
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,666
Oh no, no, no. No shower.

29
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,875
Five bucks, and that's my last offer.

30
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,625
Seven, deal.

31
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,416
♪ When the moon is showing, showing ♪

32
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,291
♪ When the sun is glowing, glowing ♪

33
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,166
♪ When the wind is blowing, blowing ♪

34
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,583
♪ I know where I'm going, going ♪

35
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,750
♪ Yes, baby, all the way to the top ♪

36
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,666
Jack, why don't you get your act together?
The clock is ticking.

37
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,666
Now you're 30. Tomorrow, you're 65,

38
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,416
and what have
you accomplished in the meantime?

39
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,958
Zilch! And why?

40
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,541
Because you're not willing to be
a little bit commercial

41
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,250
just to get back in the race.
Forget your impotence.

42
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,583
Irene, I'm blocked.
I have nothing left to say.

43
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,583
It's like the muses had gone
and left no forwarding address.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,250
For five years and three months?
Get unblocked.

45
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
You're pissing away your future!

46
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,458
I don't mind. You know, New York is sunny.

47
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,916
Women don't wear too much clothing.

48
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,291
Is it still Beatrix?

49
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,791
No, no.

50
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,000
No.

51
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,875
I'm totally over that.

52
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,541
Who cares? I mean why did you crawl all
the way to the top to get blocked for?

53
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,083
I mean, write something, anything honey.

54
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,583
Kids are the market. Kids are dumb fucks.

55
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,208
Reduce yourself to writing a Disney movie.

56
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,583
-I don't know.
-You want Beatrix back?

57
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,958
You write yourself a hit movie, and she'll
be crawling back like the bitch she is.

58
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,916
I don’t want to do anything…

59
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,833
like, not unless it’s something simple,

60
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,083
meaningful, unpretentious, you know?

61
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,166
Like that… that girl sweeping
the street over there, you know?

62
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,375
Look at that little miserable creature
over there.

63
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,333
You know, there is money
in worthwhile and unpretentious,

64
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,958
and that magazine you're
publishing and financing is a waste.

65
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,708
Not to mention your ridiculous donations.

66
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,708
I mean, you're not running
for president. Why donate?

67
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,708
I'm not starving. So why not help?

68
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,166
Well, by my calculation, you'll be
starving soon, as the rate you are going.

69
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,208
Excuse me.
Could I please have your autograph?

70
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,625
Oh, sure.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,750
-Is it…
-Mimi.

72
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,375
Mimi? OK. Is that one "m", not two? OK.

73
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,916
Whatever you say.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,250
I am managing a person who wants
to be a flop. This is insane.

75
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,333
Thank you.

76
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,333
That's mine.

77
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,500
And the panties too.

78
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,333
And the pajama

79
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,666
and the stockings.

80
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,750
Really?

81
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,708
Beatrix Shultz.

82
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,375
Need cleaning lady. Tribeca.

83
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,333
-Excuse me?
-Sorry, what are you? A Peeping Tom?

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,750
Yes, no, yeah, I know how quickly
you get forgotten in Hollywood.

85
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,291
The minute I have something,
we'll give you a holler.

86
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,125
OK, yep, no, I appreciate your interest.

87
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,916
Yeah. OK. Bye-bye.

88
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,583
OK,

89
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,416
let's take another look at you.

90
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,166
No, nothing.

91
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,416
Hello?

92
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,541
Who is it?

93
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,666
Oh. No.

94
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,125
No, I'm sorry.
I can't make another donation.

95
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:14,916
Didn't I give you 10,000 six months ago?

96
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,666
Do… Do you have it in your computer?

97
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,583
OK. Can you… Can you take me off
the list on the computer?

98
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,208
For the rest of the year?

99
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,041
Yeah, thank you.

100
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,250
OK. No, I just can't afford it right now.

101
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,291
Next?

102
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,708
Yeah, Zah-Zah Shultz, that's me.

103
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,291
I can also sing and dance.
I'm basically very versatile.

104
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,083
Do want to see a little?

105
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,000
- ♪ I go through… ♪
- We will let you know.

106
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,250
We do have your phone number, don't we?

107
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,416
Yeah, but I give it to you again.

108
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,083
9-1-7-7-6-7-8-9-8-5.

109
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,458
Then that's it.

110
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,708
That's it?
You only took my name and number.

111
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,083
Don't you want to see me do something?

112
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,666
That will come later. Thank you.

113
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,125
Um…

114
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,041
I will give this to the other actors.

115
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,000
Water?

116
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,416
Eddie, take the day off.

117
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,916
If I need to go anywhere,
I'm going to take a taxicab.

118
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,666
Yeah, you sure, boss?

119
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,291
Don't call me boss.
You're the one who wants to be a driver.

120
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,708
We both know who's boss here.

121
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,666
You got it, Jack. You know, you should get
laid or something. You look pale.

122
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,541
I've been pale for the past five years.
Maybe you should get laid.

123
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,166
I do, all the time…
especially in this car.

124
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
What can I get you, babe?

125
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,791
Ah… I'm going to have the usual.

126
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,875
Coming right up.

127
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,125
You're one of my heroes, you know?

128
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,291
I tell everybody I know you,
and they're very impressed.

129
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,250
Oh. Thank you. I appreciate that.

130
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,375
- Gesundheit!
- Yeah, thank you.

131
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,708
Impossible to concentrate here,

132
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,416
with people sneezing
in the middle of the summer.

133
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,708
Are you going to order anything or what?

134
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,416
In a minute.

135
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,416
You can't sit here and not order
for hours. It's a new millennium.

136
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,833
You have to order within the same
calendar year as your arrival, fraulein!

137
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,208
How about that lovely bubbly water
they catch in France

138
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:11,083
that comes in this strange
green bottle with strange green label…

139
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,041
What's it called?

140
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,958
-Perrier.
-Yes!

141
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,500
I'll have a seltzer, all right?

142
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,375
Waiter? I'll skip the seltzer.

143
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,875
Fucking immigrant parasite!

144
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,416
One thing you
should know about New York City:

145
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,958
it's a jungle! Dog eat dog!

146
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,958
I'm not a dog. I'm a cat. Not just a cat…

147
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:51,916
a lioness!
And if this is jungle, I'm at home!

148
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,833
Oh.

149
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,375
Oh. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

150
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,375
"Never swallow, always spit."
That's my motto.

151
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,916
Uh, I'm Sparkle.

152
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,750
Nice to meet you, too.

153
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,458
I'm Greta Garbonsky.

154
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,833
Nice to meet you too.
Are you new on the street, or…

155
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,250
Yeah.

156
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,041
-New here altogether.
-Oh.

157
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,291
The street is good for me, though.

158
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,958
Because you know, hotel rates are…

159
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:30,666
out of the question.

160
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,708
‎ I know.

161
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,541
I have to keep moving all the time.

162
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,458
Got to be on the go.

163
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,166
-Bye.
-Oh.

164
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,291
Bye.

165
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:14,666
"I see you boys of summer in your ruin…"

166
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,208
What are you doing?

167
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,666
It said, prepare a monologue. I'm doing
Dylan Thomas with a Danish accent.

168
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,583
I know he was Welsh, but I prefer
Danish accent because of Hamlet.

169
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:31,458
A Danish or a pretzel? At Magic
Land Productions, we don't do Bob Dylan.

170
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,041
Freezing my ass off…

171
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,916
For art.

172
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,541
‎

173
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,125
"She stood bare-assed by the sidewalk,

174
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,375
her short, funky hair blowing
in the cool autumn breeze,

175
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,500
worthless creature,
with no future and a questionable past.

176
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,166
The kind of creature that

177
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,125
degenerates our streets to the level of a…

178
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,541
Third World burg."

179
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,583
No…

180
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,666
I'm going to write a commercial movie.

181
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm going to write a commercial. I'm going
to write a commercial shmomercial shovie.

182
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:53,333
"Where blew a flower
May a flower no more

183
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,541
Lift its head to the blows of the rain"

184
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:02,250
"Though they be mad
And dead as nails

185
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:07,250
Heads of the characters
Hammer through daisies

186
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:12,625
Break in the sun
Till the sun breaks down

187
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,916
And Death shall have no dominion

188
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:23,166
And Death shall have no dominion"

189
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,125
This is a residential building. Get lost!

190
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah, sure…

191
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,375
Hello, this is Zah-Zah Shultz…

192
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,916
I'm an actress. I saw the ad…

193
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,458
No, I'm trained in most methods--

194
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,166
Get off this stoop! Go away!

195
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,166
All right, all right, calm down.

196
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,166
I was just getting a bite,
cooling my heels,

197
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,083
schmoozing.

198
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,458
I know your type.

199
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What's my type? Look who's talking!

200
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,583
You are the one looks kind of weird!

201
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,208
So be a little…

202
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,791
Humble, humble…
You don't own this house, you know?

203
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,000
But I do.

204
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:35,208
Idea for a scene, um…
girl eating a slice of pizza,

205
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,708
talking in a strange accent,
quoting Dylan Thomas…

206
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,250
Need rest of story…

207
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,833
Maybe she says,
"Death shall have no dominion",

208
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,166
is hit by a garbage truck,
falls into a trash can and croaks.

209
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,666
Some symbolism there, perhaps?

210
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,708
No.

211
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,291
Not Hollywood enough. Too deep.

212
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,625
In.

213
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,000
Out.

214
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,583
Then you hold one nostril,

215
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,458
breathe through the other,
and exhale through the mouth.

216
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,500
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

217
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,041
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

218
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:24,958
Project!

219
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,208
Huh!

220
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,250
- Huh!
- Hm.

221
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,625
Half an hour every day.

222
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,791
You have to loosen the vocal cords.

223
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,625
You have to start learning to speak
from scratch, like a baby…

224
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,000
if you want to lose that French accent.

225
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:46,166
I do. Meanwhile I cover
my French accent with a Swedish one.

226
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,041
Why?

227
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,625
I love Greta Garbo.

228
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,541
My favorite is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

229
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,000
"I'll be back!"

230
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh well. Let's continue.

231
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,375
Huh!

232
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,208
Huh!

233
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,541
Huh! Huh! Huh!

234
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,500
-Can I help you?
-Here to see Mrs. Shultz. I'm Val.

235
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,083
Use the back elevator, 7J.

236
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,666
Oh.

237
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,375
Um…

238
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,166
These letters of recommendation
are very impressive.

239
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,625
Of course,
they're all from European people.

240
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,208
The Baron von Opel?

241
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,875
The Duke of Gstaadt?

242
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,541
Is there a Duke of Gstaadt?

243
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,333
Well, never mind.

244
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,250
The question is, can you clean a toilet?

245
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,250
I certainly can.

246
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,666
‎
‎I am a wonderful toilet cleaner.

247
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,708
OK.

248
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,416
Let's take a ride with the devil.

249
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,458
Just remember,
I never give anyone a second chance.

250
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,625
I'll be home around six,
so slam the door behind you, gently.

251
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,541
Will do.

252
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,375
Don't bother to steal the Renoirs.

253
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,958
They're insured, and they're fake.

254
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,708
♪ Just like I love it ♪

255
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:45,250
♪ Just like I love it ♪

256
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:49,583

258
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:09,333
-Hello.
-Beatrix, it's Jack. Um…

259
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,083
I was thinking of you.

260
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,000
Um,

261
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:20,000
and I get all hot and sweaty
when I'm thinking about your nipples.

262
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,625
This is not Beatrix. It's Val.

263
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,333
‎No sweaty nipples.

264
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,583
Val? Are you a relative?

265
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,625
Um, relatively the cleaning lady.

266
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,416
‎

267
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,375
Thank you. Have a nice day.

268
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,958
Yeah, you too.

269
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,166
Who was that? Some kind of a hippie?

270
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,625
That cleaning lady in 7J.

271
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,083
Really? She was cute.

272
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,291
Eh. You know something, Benito,
cleaning women are all the same.

273
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,708
They stink of detergent
and garlic and sweat.

274
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:17,166
Cleaning women and cooks, you stay
away from them. They don't smell good.

275
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,458
They don't fuck good. They embarrass you
if you take them out or anything.

276
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,208
That's a lot of horseshit, Kareem.

277
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,125
And if you ask me,

278
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,000
I still say she was cute.

279
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:33,625
I'll go jerk off in the basement.
Be back in two shakes.

280
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:49,791
Touché.

281
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,000
Can I buy you lunch after school?

282
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,208
After school, I clean the classroom.

283
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,666
And after that?

284
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,958
After that, I clean
the ear piercing salon and an apartment…

285
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,000
-…and a church.
-And then?

286
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,708
And then I rehearse and go to sleep.

287
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,041
Ahhhh… ahhhh… mmmm

288
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:36,375
‎

289
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,291
Hey!

290
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,208
Mmmm…

291
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,125
Hey!

292
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,583
Hey, can you go fornicate somewhere else?

293
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,416
Ahhh…

294
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,333
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

295
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,833
‎ Enough for tonight.

296
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,666
-Ready?
-Yeah, I'll have the special.

297
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,333
Mashed potatoes or fries?

298
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,291
Fries.

299
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,875
Will there be anything else?

300
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:21,541
Can you take that back and bring me
a new order of French Fries please?

301
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,333
Why? Because you're French?

302
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:27,500
No. Because I saw a live insect in there.

303
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:32,125
Oh my God. I'm terribly sorry, madam.
I'll be right back.

304
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,458
New fries!

305
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You are very hot, aren't you?

306
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh my God.
It's like a steam room in there.

307
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,666
Plus, you know something?
I'm really hot naturally.

308
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,791
‎-I'm like a stove.
‎-

309
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,291
I'll get your fries now.

310
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,000
Thank you.

311
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:01,875
Hey, got you another order of Coke.
It's on the house.

312
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,875
You could have got me fired.

313
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
What's your name?

314
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:08,916
Edna.

315
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,875
I'm Val. It's short for Valnerable,
not for Valerie.

316
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,500
Vulnerable is spelled with a "u".
Anything else you need to know?

317
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,333
Hm… Give me the check.

318
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:23,458
It comes to 9.29 plus tax.

319
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,666
I guess with the insect and shit,
I don't get a tip, huh?

320
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,166
No, sure you do.

321
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,875
OK, $10.58, with tax.

322
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,625
You know what, forget it…

323
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,541
No. Keep the change.

324
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,166
Oh wow, thanks, gee.

325
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,958
Hey, I have a good idea.

326
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,833
Why don't you give me your phone number,

327
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,750
so that way if I have
a poetry reading or something then,

328
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,500
you know, I could give you a call.

329
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:00,625

338
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:14,666
Hello?

339
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,583
What?

340
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,000
Oh, nein, nein…

341
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,375
I will meet you
on the corner from mein house,

342
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,750
in… thirty minuten.

343
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,333
Excuse me, do you mind
if I use the ladies room?

344
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,291
Sure.

345
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:33,416
Thank you.

346
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,375
"A cellphone rings,
shattering the silence,

347
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,208
‎the girl inside her sleeping bags
‎awakes at once…"

348
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,916
Robert De Niro comes here a lot.

349
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,666
Really? You are not shitting me, are you?

350
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,583
Oh, no.

351
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:09,333
I loved The Schweggen Holfer.

352
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,041
It's Scweggen Holfer.

353
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,166
Oh. I mean the Deer Hunter.

354
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,625
Deer Hunter, yes, that was a great flick.
Bobby's a good friend of mine.

355
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,083
Can I get you another drink?

356
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,750
Nein, thank you so much.

357
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,666
I have to get up in the morning.

358
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,958
Nora's nights are hard to bear…

359
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:33,500
I love you, baby.
I love you, I love you, I love you!

360
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,333
I want to have your baby, now!

361
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,333
It the only thing I live for.

362
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,916
May I disrobe?

363
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:46,541
Touch my heart, please, my darling,

364
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:49,500
see how I shake inside.

365
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:52,583
How you know, I love this part of Nora.

366
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:57,625
I think I can do it so well
if I get this chance.

367
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,791
It's not easy going with an unknown.

368
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,166
It's risky.

369
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,125
But I love risky things.

370
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,583
Every great star was
once unknown waitress.

371
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,583
I really have to go now.

372
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,166
I'll at least walk you to the house.

373
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,375
This is really not necessary.

374
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:21,625
I know it's not necessary, but I'd like to
be a gentleman. It's the least I can do…

375
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,833
is walk you home.

376
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,666
Good evening, ma'am.

377
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,666
You look wonderful tonight, as usual.

378
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,208
Thank you.

379
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,625
Benito is always at your service.

380
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,708
Benito, good night.

381
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,333
Good night.

382
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,333
Aren't you a director of karate films?

383
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:03,291
I saw you on a talk show
on some cable TV station, a sex channel.

384
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,333
No, no, no, no. I do big Hollywood dramas,

385
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:10,291
like Gone with the Wind,
The Sound of Music, more updated.

386
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:11,875
Romantic comedies.

387
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,708
I can get you a picture and resume.

388
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:17,500
I was the kick boxing welterweight
champion of Thessaloniki.

389
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:18,916
Easy, take it easy.

390
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,375
Excuse me.

391
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,666
Yes?

392
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,291
Didn't I ask you not to sit on this stoop?

393
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,500
What's your problem?

394
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,083
I'll tell you. I don't like
drugged-out hookers sitting on my steps.

395
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,375
Oh, I see. Why not?

396
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,083
Look, I'm not going to have
this discussion with you.

397
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,166
You want me to call the cops,
I'll do it, gladly.

398
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,500
"Gladly."

399
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,750
Why the joy?

400
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,291
Why don't you call the cops sadly?

401
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,166
After all, they'd be taking me to jail.

402
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,916
I'm going, I'm going, all right.

403
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,166
Hello? Who?

404
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,958
Yeah, this is Zah-Zah.

405
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,958
Can I call you back?
I'm in the middle of something here.

406
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,583
Oh. Yes, let me have it.

407
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:47,541
Got it. Thank you. See you later,
alligator. Okey dokey. Tschüss.

408
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,250
You want the rest of this water?
It's fresh. No?

409
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:55,833
So long.

410
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,083
And do me a favor.

411
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,625
Don't come sneaking back to sleep
underneath my window at night.

412
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:06,125
This is not a hotel for homeless people.

413
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,875
You should get a job
or a sublet or something,

414
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,000
maybe something with a bathroom,

415
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:13,375
so you don't have to pee
in my flowers in the middle of the night.

416
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:17,500
So you could take a shower once in a while
without stinking up the whole street.

417
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:22,416
May… Oh… Maybe, just do not
come back to this stoop!

418
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,291
You really think I'm a hooker?
Is that what your problem is?

419
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,083
No. No, no. No.

420
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:29,833
I know what you are.

421
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,833
You're an actress, which is worse.

422
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:37,416
You put on some weird accent
and some trashy clothes,

423
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,708
and you think the next thing
you're going to become is a

424
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,250
‎hotshot movie star overnight.

425
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,958
Well you know what? Forget it honey,
'cause it doesn't happen.

426
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,041
The next thing you'll become is a hooker,

427
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:48,958
no matter how many copies of Ulysses or
Long Day's Journey into Fucking Night

428
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,958
you keep in that shitty
little sleeping-bag of yours.

429
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,291
You are a mean person.
You have no right to talk to me like that!

430
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,875
You know what? Fuck off!
Because I had a rough childhood too.

431
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Mama?

432
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,083
Afraid not.

433
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:19,583
What happened?

434
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,166
Think you fainted.

435
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,875
What happened to my clothes?

436
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,500
Well, I took them off.

437
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,791
You took off my clothes?

438
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,416
I had to.

439
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,750
You had to? Why? Who forced you
to take my damn clothes off?

440
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,750
I wanted you
to able to breathe.

441
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,458
I didn't know what was wrong with you.

442
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:52,875
What did you do?

443
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,041
What did you do to me?

444
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,500
I did nothing to you!

445
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,541
I mean, I took you into my house.

446
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,458
Maybe I'm the one
who should call the cops.

447
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,000
I have to check if I'm still virgin.

448
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,875
Please.

449
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,083
This is a pretty messed up apartment.

450
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:14,583
What happened to you?
Your wife threw you out?

451
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,958
Your sleeping bag is by the door.

452
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,125
I see it.

453
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,166
Why do you work so hard
at something that's so meaningless?

454
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,041
Being an actress.

455
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,375
I mean, it's not like
you're curing cancer or something.

456
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,125
I've promised my mother that
I'll be a star,

457
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,083
that she'll be able to see every night,

458
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,083
in the sky, even when she's dead.

459
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,708
You see, my mother never left our village
in France.

460
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,916
She couldn't read or write.

461
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,250
Movies were her only entertainment.

462
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,875
She always told me that she would live,
through me.

463
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,583
Oh, I get it.

464
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,750
You were looking for needle marks.

465
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,208
You checked my arms and my legs, right?

466
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:10,166
So, what did you find, Sherlock?

467
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,708
Nothing.

468
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,375
I mean, you could put
on a few pounds, but…

469
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,708
No kidding. You make me sick, you know.

470
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,125
You wimpy, limpy, weirdo.

471
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,916
You know, why don't you just go?

472
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,541
Love to.

473
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,375
I'm going, all right?

474
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,375
Does… Does this happen to you often?

475
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,583
No. This was a first.

476
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,833
Well… Um… If you…

477
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:43,000
I mean, if you need a couple dollars,
just to get you through the day.

478
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,250
Here. Here, put it in your pocket.

479
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,583
If you haven't gotten what you wanted
out of me by now, mister,

480
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,541
you are never going to get it.

481
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,416
You had your chance when I was in a coma.

482
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,458
You know what… Fuck it, forget it!

483
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:02,000
And good luck, with the rest
of your worthless little life.

484
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:03,791
Thank you.

485
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,500
Merde! Motherfucker.

486
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:09,333
And my wife did throw me out,

487
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,000
not before she took up
with some real estate guy from New Jersey.

488
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,625
He got my apartment
in Tribeca and everything.

489
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:18,000
And I thought we had
something going on forever.

490
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,541
I never figured her for the super
ambitious, ballbusting, arrogant,

491
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:26,291
uh… nymphomaniac that
she turned out to be.

492
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,500
I mean, that just shows you
how fucking smart I am.

493
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,958
And thank you
for your interest in my heartaches!

494
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:59,166
She represents everything I despise.
She's…

495
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:03,041
a pushy, common, irrationally optimistic,

496
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,750
unhygienic, unprofessional, too young.

497
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,083
She's always smiling, but in like a…

498
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:13,208
A… A beautiful, funny smile,
but meaningless.

499
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,166
She's smart but in…

500
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,125
impractical ways.

501
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,333
She's irritatingly chipper, but…

502
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,791
She doesn't sound so terrible, Jack.

503
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,833
Well, it's because
I'm not describing her correctly. Um…

504
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,833
She's not like any other woman
I've met before.

505
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:39,083
No, you know what?
Actually, the result would be the same.

506
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,375
She would break my heart,
and nothing would come of it.

507
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,625
Can I help you?

508
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,666
Excuse me, Ms.?

509
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:18,375
You decided
not to give me the part of Nora?

510
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,166
It was a tough call.

511
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,666
You got someone really famous?

512
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:27,250
No, in the end, we decided to go
with someone relatively unknown.

513
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:31,583
She's done a couple of films,
three porno flicks in Ottawa.

514
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,041
Then why?

515
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:38,000
Truthfully? She gives terrific blowjobs.

516
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,083
What is blowjob?

517
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,000
Is it the same as nose job?

518
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,250
No.

519
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,750
We signed her this morning.

520
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:49,500
But look, Val, I'm sure
there's some small but exciting part

521
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:50,833
that I can dig up.

522
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,458
Just be a little nicer to me.

523
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,416
‎

524
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,666
"Black screen as night turns
into dawn. Hard Cut.

525
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,333
50 fighter jets appear
over the skyline of Manhattan.

526
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,291
A thundering of jets overhead turns into
the horrible sound of bombs exploding,

527
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,000
buildings collapsing, people screaming.

528
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:15,291
Hard Cut. Johnny and Brenda
make love in his bedroom.

529
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,958
She is the most beautiful girl
in the world.

530
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:20,750
He is virile and masculine, scarred by his
many previous combat experiences…

531
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,083
'I will always love you, Johnny',
she murmurs.

532
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:26,500
Her neck splashes wide open
from a direct mortar hit.

533
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:32,500
The radio on the floor suddenly starts
playing 'Only the Good Die Young',

534
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,375
finally bringing Johnny out of his sleep.

535
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,791
He sits up on the bed, and then
the whole room explodes around him,

536
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,625
giving him a split-second
to duck out the window,

537
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,750
20 stories high."

538
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,708
So far, so good.

539
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:50,875
Hey.

540
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,416
How can I help you?

541
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:54,791
Ah…

542
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,416
-Do you…
-The roses are beautiful.

543
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,750
‎The red ones, fresh. You like?

544
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,041
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I like.

545
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,416
Let me get them for you.

546
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,833
-Oh, no, no.
-Anything else?

547
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:07,791
No. Uh, no. No, thank you.

548
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,083
For you, twenty-five bucks.

549
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,916
OK, all right, sure.

550
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,583
Actually,

551
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,166
you… you know the girl that used
to sweep for you around here?

552
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,916
Ah… French accent…

553
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,375
She disappeared. I know
other sweeps if you're interested.

554
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:33,000
-No.
-Not as cute, not as cheap.

555
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:34,875
Not nearly as cute.

556
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,166
All right.

557
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,375
Hi, excuse me.

558
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,208
You want to go on a date?

559
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:45,708
Oh, no, no, no. Did you,
have you by any chance seen,

560
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:49,416
there's a girl that sleeps
on the corner on Tenth Street?

561
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:55,250
Oh yeah, actually, I know her.

562
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,166
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

563
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,208
-You seen her lately, by any chance?
-No.

564
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:02,000
OK, all right, thanks a lot.

565
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,250
Wh… Why?

566
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:08,750
You… You like her better
than me or something?

567
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,750
Oh, no, no.

568
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,416
It's like a work thing, so… thank you.

569
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,375
Oh, Val, still here?

570
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:22,291
Oh, I was just about done.
I'll be out in five minutes.

571
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,291
Hello?

572
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:36,750
You can't keep calling
here like this, baby.

573
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:40,250
I… no… I… It's been five years, and…

574
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,416
I got company.

575
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:47,375
Get a life, honey. I'm… you know…

576
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,708
Get another wife,
write another screenplay.

577
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,791
OK, bye.

578
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:57,291
Um…

579
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,500
Do you want something to…

580
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,333
drink, Luke?

581
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,208
Hm… Maybe a touch of Scotch.

582
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:08,583
Oh yes, me too with a twist of lime,
please.

583
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,916
Um… I mean, I'll get it.

584
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:18,750
How do you take it?

585
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,708
Ice, no water.

586
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,583
This is quite outrageous.

587
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:48,791
Your job, Val, is to clean my apartment,
not receive my guests.

588
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:52,125
Now, please leave.
It was four hours, right?

589
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:59,500
-Look, Beatrix--
-Ms. Shultz. Ms. Shultz to you.

590
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:04,458
Baron von Opel has never heard of you.
I called Germany.

591
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,666
Ms. Shultz is fine.

592
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,125
I need this job, honestly.

593
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:13,458
Well, that's tough,
'cause you just lost it.

594
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,000
Now get out.

595
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:31,000
Now, was that necessary?
She didn't mean anything bad.

596
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,541
Listen, Luke,

597
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,583
I expect you to back me up.
I expect you to give me support.

598
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:39,708
I mean, I do not expect you,
for instance, to…

599
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:43,083
flirt with the help or contradict me
when I try to put them in their place.

600
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:44,708
Take it easy, all right?

601
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:47,208
You are flying a little bit
off the handle here.

602
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,000
You thought she was sexy, didn't you?

603
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,541
Goodbye, Benito. Thanks for everything.

604
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,333
Oh, not at all.
I'll see you next week, Val.

605
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:00,791
I don't think so.

606
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,416
I've been kicked out on my ass.

607
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:05,916
Bye.

608
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:08,625
Wait a minute!

609
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:19,208
You have a good day, ma'am.

610
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,708
Come and see us sometime.

611
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,416
Faster! Faster!

612
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,125
-Wait!
-Can't hear you!

613
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,375
We have things to discuss!

614
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,958
-What?
-We have things to discuss!

615
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:46,583
My name is Jack Gardner.

616
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:50,458
Meanwhile, I've been writing
a manuscript around you.

617
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:53,833
Fish out of water, but you know,
like with a sunny disposition.

618
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,583
What do you want, Jack?

619
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:59,875
Well, I need more material.

620
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,333
Where do you come from? Who are you?

621
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,541
I'm French.

622
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,416
I come from a small town.

623
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:12,708
It's really more like a village,

624
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:17,291
and my family
has lived there for generations,

625
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,625
but I had dreams.

626
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:23,250
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on one second. Let me actually…

627
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:26,875
Let me write this down.

628
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,666
Yeah.

629
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,333
OK.

630
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,875
Small town…

631
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,916
French…

632
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:40,875
Dreams…

633
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,541
I've no time to waste.

634
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:47,291
I came here to do something,
not to be joke material for you.

635
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:53,708
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, wait. No, look,
you've just started. Look, I need more!

636
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,750
Oh, I see.

637
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:57,833
What?

638
00:49:57,916 --> 00:49:59,375
You're in love with me.

639
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,333
You follow me around all the time.
You write notes about me.

640
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:06,833
You insult me. You kick me away.
You go looking for me.

641
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:08,041
You love me.

642
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:09,541
You're crazy.

643
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:10,625
Really?

644
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:24,791
You love me.

645
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,041
That's not true.

646
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,958
I love my ex-wife.

647
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,208
Good.

648
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:34,416
Because I can't stand you! So fuck off!
I had a rough childhood too!

649
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,500
"Once

650
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:45,541
When the night opened her thighs

651
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,083
And swallowed me, like a canary

652
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:51,666
I felt pierced

653
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:54,875
By the complicity of the stars

654
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,166
Once

655
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,375
When I stepped on a bug by accident

656
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,291
I was thrilled

657
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:07,916
By the blue, black
Iridescence of insect death"

658
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,416
Well,

659
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:14,166
I spent a good chunk of time
in jail, six years,

660
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,000
for armed robbery.

661
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:19,625
And I was in this jail cell
with five other guys

662
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,125
because nobody noticed I was a girl.

663
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:25,041
And at that point,
I wasn't about to tell them.

664
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:31,041
That's when they put me in a psychiatric
ward for a month for observation.

665
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:36,708
Afterwards, they released me
into the Commonwealth of Los Angeles.

666
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:37,666
Anyhow,

667
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:44,166
while I was there, I developed a major
crush on this cute little nurse, who…

668
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:50,416
…as it turned out, was illiterate
and had a blond mustache she called Fred.

669
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:54,208
Anyhow,
I was writing her all these love poems,

670
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:57,916
and somehow, these poems found their way
to the Psychotic Weekly,

671
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,166
and that, in a nutshell,
is how I got started.

672
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,541
Shut up already and
go fucky-fucky elsewhere!

673
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:08,875
Hey, go fucky-fucky yourself.

674
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,125
‎Philistines.

675
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,833
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's get out of here.

676
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:33,916
No, no, I just finished
the opening sequence.

677
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:37,666
Like, twenty pages.

678
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:40,750
Good stuff, yeah.

679
00:52:55,791 --> 00:53:00,333
Hey, you know what?
I get these bacterial things on my ass.

680
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:03,708
They're really hard to get rid of,
especially in the summertime.

681
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:04,791
Hm…

682
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,791
Hey, so is everything all right?

683
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,416
-Great.
-Yeah?

684
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,541
Are you sure it's OK?

685
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,666
Yeah, you know what? I could use
somebody to split the rent with.

686
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,708
So how much can you handle?
Like five hundred a month?

687
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:19,416
Um… Two hundred? Two… Two hundred?

688
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,708
Twenty?

689
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,166
Done. OK.

690
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,875
Yes. Yes. Ah…

691
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:30,416
- Take me home, big boy!
- Ah…

692
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,875
Mamma wants it now.

693
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:35,541
Hello? Hello?

694
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:41,375
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, baby, yes!

695
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:48,333
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

696
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:51,750
Fuck the fuck out of me, Mr. Rudolph!

697
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:58,291
Oh, fuck me.

698
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:03,375
Val? Is that you?

699
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:04,958
Yeah.

700
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:08,583
Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you.

701
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,833
Can you come here for a minute?

702
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,583
No, no, I'm fine.

703
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,000
Val… Val, please.

704
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,666
There's no one here. I, um…

705
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,500
I talk in my sleep.

706
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:33,500
Like, I think that someone is screwing me,
and then I start to scream.

707
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,791
You're not going to leave me, are you?

708
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,166
No, are you kidding?

709
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,458
You can talk in your dreams all you want.
I don't care.

710
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:45,041
All I care about is getting a break.

711
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,500
Oh, I see.

712
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:09,791
Hello.

713
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,083
Val, how are you?

714
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,583
I'm all right. And you, Sparkle?

715
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:17,416
Uh… same old, same old.
You know, different day, same shit.

716
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,541
What's the name of the dog?

717
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,583
Knish.

718
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:26,208
Um, Val… so you're
a struggling actress, too, right?

719
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,125
Mm.

720
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:31,250
-Ah, well, yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
-Yeah.

721
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,541
Hi.

722
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,166
Sister girl.

723
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,583
Have you gotten any acting gigs yet?

724
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,833
Not a whole bunch, but…

725
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,083
Not really. Oh!

726
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:41,750
But I will… Oh, sorry, Knish.

727
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,125
It's OK.

728
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:48,083
'Cause we're really interested in acting.

729
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,666
I… we are.

730
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:51,291
OK.

731
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,833
You sure you did this before?

732
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,583
Yeah, I good Chinese cook.

733
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,416
Substantial portions
of the film be will played

734
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,666
with some nudity on the part of Bridget.

735
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,000
How much nudity?

736
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:37,666
Frontal and back.

737
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:39,458
Are you kidding?

738
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:42,875
Not at all. All great actresses
do nudity these days.

739
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,041
That's not true.

740
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:48,041
It started decades ago.
Barbra Streisand, Meryl Streep,

741
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:51,750
Michelle Pfeiffer, Julia Roberts.
They all started as porn actresses.

742
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:55,041
Never. This is a monologue,

743
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:58,000
She's… she's in the kitchen by herself,

744
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,583
doing the dishes.

745
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:02,750
Naked! Look, Art, can we get
the next actress in here please?

746
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,458
Let's talk privately, Val.

747
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:07,500
I knew you
when your name was still Zah-Zah.

748
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,916
-I can explain that.
-That's not my point.

749
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,541
My point is, this is a tough racket.

750
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,791
Someone offers you
an opportunity, you grab it.

751
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:17,166
All you need is one good part in a hit
movie, you can write your own ticket.

752
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,208
Tell them all to go screw themselves.

753
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,875
But until that time,

754
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:24,208
you kiss anybody's feet
and say "thank you".

755
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:28,375
She was 92 when she kicked the bucket,

756
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,833
16 years ago, my grandmother Sefka.

757
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:39,041
But I still remember her
as if it was yesterday.

758
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:41,875
Cupcakes…

759
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:44,041
…was her nickname in her youth

760
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,208
because she wore a size D-8 brassiere

761
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:52,583
and was the favorite pin-up girl
of Air Force pilots

762
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:55,166
from her hometown in Lincoln, Illinois,

763
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:59,541
when they went on
their bombing missions in World War II,

764
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,750
across the Atlantic.

765
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,458
They had her image before their eyes

766
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:10,208
when they bombed
the Fuehrer in the bunker.

767
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:24,916
Esmeralda! Esmeralda!

768
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:32,375
Esmeralda! Esmeralda! Where are you?

769
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:41,791
Woah, hey, hey, Val. Woah, sorry.

770
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,958
Hey, um…

771
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,333
I wanted to tell you…

772
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,083
Well, first of all, I don't love you.

773
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,791
That was a ridiculous
and arrogant statement for you to make.

774
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:55,375
-So, secondly…
-I've no time!

775
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,333
Don't. Wait, wait. Sorry. Sorry.

776
00:59:57,416 --> 01:00:00,125
I keep touching your hunch, um…

777
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:05,083
My point is, is that you,
you do have something.

778
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:10,958
Um… What that is or how it
can possibly be useful, I don't know,

779
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:15,541
but you should stick with it,

780
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:17,875
no matter what.

781
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:21,833
Anything else?

782
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:23,458
No.

783
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:46,458
You fired.

784
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,791
I'm fired. Why?

785
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,125
Because you late.

786
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,125
I'm late because I had an audition
for The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

787
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,625
Did you get it?

788
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:57,000
No. I wasn't hunched enough.

789
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,875
I sorry. You nice girl.
But you still fired.

790
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:00,791
Why?

791
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:03,625
Because customer complain.
Egg roll too mushy.

792
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,166
Shit.

793
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:15,291
This is not exactly
the script we talked about.

794
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:20,166
This isn't exactly
the grand epic of the destruction

795
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,166
and resurrection of New York, is it?

796
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,250
Or did I blink?

797
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,416
Very well…

798
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,083
Well, I, uh…

799
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:31,458
But I thought that…

800
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,583
I love it! It's funny!

801
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:41,583
It's brilliant! It is better than
the destruction of New York by aliens.

802
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:43,750
When did you suddenly
become such a romantic?

803
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,250
Oh, no, it's nothing like that.

804
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,666
Do you remember when we first met, Jack?

805
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:53,041
I was still in my 30's, and you were,
what, a high school kid?

806
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,208
I knew you had it in you.

807
01:01:57,416 --> 01:01:58,458
Didn't I?

808
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:04,875
Didn't I?

809
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:07,333
Yeah.

810
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:12,416
Tooto nono shmono productivimo fuckivimo.

811
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,708
Oh my God.

812
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:18,666
I love la bellesimo Español so much.

813
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,541
It just gets me wet every time. Vino?

814
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:24,125
-Si?
-Si.

815
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:26,458
Oh. Sorry.

816
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:29,291
You can just lick that
off the table if you want.

817
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,583
"Once, when the canary opened her legs

818
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:44,416
Spread her thighs, she felt pierced
By the erection of the stars"

819
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,250
God, Ms. Raunchy.

820
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:53,291
"She felt pierced, she felt pierced
She felt pierced by that star

821
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:56,750
She said, 'Hey, come on, daddy

822
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:58,916
Give me your cigar'"

823
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,875
"Come on, give me your cigar"

824
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:07,625
"She said, 'Hey, hunky daddy
I'll be waiting in the car

825
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:11,708
Hey, hunky daddy
I'll be waiting in the car'''

826
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,166
"Come on, give me your cigar"

827
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,958
- Woo!
- "Just give me your cigar"

828
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:24,416
Oh my God. You are one crazy chick.

829
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,583
That was fun.

830
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,250
Oh my God.

831
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,125
I have to go to bed.

832
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:33,625
Yeah. Let's, let's, let's, let's…

833
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,458
We both had too much to drink.

834
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:49,125
Um, I'll, ah, hit the bathroom.

835
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:55,708
Yeah, well, OK. Don't hit it too hard.

836
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,791
It's not you. It's me.
I all of a sudden turned gay.

837
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,333
Have been here three weeks and…

838
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,166
I haven't gotten anywhere.

839
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,625
This is not going to work.

840
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,958
Thanks for everything.

841
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:58,958
Time to go, dear.

842
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:01,708
Time to go.

843
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,083
Park closes at dusk.

844
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,416
This material looks
very promising.

845
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,791
‎

846
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,875
And the girl is hysterical.

847
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:20,625
And once you have
the book deal and the paperback,

848
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,541
we can start talking concretely
about the film.

849
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,916
Nuts and bolts.

850
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:28,875
It can be a powerful vehicle
for one of our upcoming stars.

851
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:32,291
I flew here from the Coast, Mr. Gardner.

852
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:35,041
That shows you we are plenty interested.

853
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:39,250
Your previous screenplay was such a jewel.

854
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,541
So, what have you been doing
with yourself?

855
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:47,333
Hey, none of my business. An artist
can be a recluse, a faggot, whatever.

856
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:49,750
All geniuses are lunatics, right?

857
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,833
This is the story of Cinderella

858
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:57,750
and her two step-sisters,

859
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,375
who were mean to her

860
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:02,166
because they were jealous.

861
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,916
Oops, I dropped something.

862
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,916
-Yeah, me too.
-Clean it up.

863
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:12,958
Cinderella,
where'd you get that ugly dress?

864
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:15,625
Yeah, you look so ugly.

865
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:17,708
Yeah, and stupid too.

866
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,333
What's your problem
Cinderella, do you hear me?

867
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:24,291
-Hm?
-Huh?

868
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:27,083
Cinderella tried to hide from them.

869
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,208
-Hey, Cinderella!
-Come back here.

870
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:34,500
They're after me. Where should I go?

871
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:36,083
That way!

872
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,416
Thank you.

873
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:44,791
And she dreamed
of a happy and glorious future

874
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:51,000
when the clouds are gone
and the sun is glowing,

875
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:54,583
when her handsome prince would come.

876
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:59,041
You two were really wonderful.

877
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,708
It's a tough gig for zero bucks.

878
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:07,291
Usually I prefer like Shakespeare,
you know, or like Bertold Brecht.

879
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:08,208
But…

880
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:10,875
thanks for getting
us the chance, Val. It was really fun!

881
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:12,125
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

882
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:13,291
Bye.

883
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,791
I thought there would be critics.

884
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,875
I thought there would be somebody.

885
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:23,458
Where are you?

886
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:40,708
Sit down now.

887
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,041
Thank you for coming.

888
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,750
Some Schnapps?

889
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,291
OK.

890
01:07:55,625 --> 01:08:01,208
I'm sorry about the way
I fired you when we last met.

891
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:05,791
The truth is I was going through a bit
of a personal crisis at the time.

892
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:09,416
That's all right.
I have no bad feelings if you don't.

893
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,666
My ex-husband is a lunatic…

894
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:15,458
But what a mind.

895
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:19,875
He still calls all the time
to talk about my nipple.

896
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,291
He publishes this paper. Jack Gardner?

897
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,750
Jack Gardner?

898
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:38,833
Yeah.

899
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:43,500
The one you're having
an affair with. My ex.

900
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,875
An affair? No.

901
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:50,000
I just used to live there on the street,
by his house, in his garden.

902
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,375
He threw me out.

903
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:52,750
Oh.

904
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,000
Well, that's reassuring.

905
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:59,583
My apartment has been a mess
for past three months,

906
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:02,166
and I want it clean,
like it was when you were here,

907
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:06,875
so, if you will go back to toilet licking
and vacuuming the floors,

908
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:09,583
then you've got yourself a job
for fifteen bucks an hour.

909
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,208
Sounds great.

910
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:16,375
I don't actually lick the toilet,
but I get it clean.

911
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:22,750
Hey.

912
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,541
-Hello, Jack.
-Hey.

913
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,250
Ah… May I come in?

914
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,125
‎

915
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,416
Sorry I couldn't do it.

916
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:06,958
I… enjoyed it. It was good for me. I…

917
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:11,916
I don't mind oral sex
or whatever, manually.

918
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,458
There are a lot of ways to deal with…

919
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:19,208
Anyway, I…

920
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:22,833
I am much more open-minded than you think.

921
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:25,875
And I've changed, Jack, really.

922
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:31,375
You realize over time that life doesn't
always play in bright colors

923
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,666
and blinding lights.

924
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:37,166
I… I can accept that.

925
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,291
Beatrix,

926
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,125
I still want my life to play in…

927
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:48,125
bright colors and blinding lights.

928
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,166
What are you saying, Jack?

929
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,208
What about us?

930
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,166
Maybe it's not meant to be.

931
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,000
Strange.

932
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,958
I feel free of you now.

933
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:12,625
I feel totally lost.

934
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:17,208
This place is a mess.

935
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,250
Hey, you!

936
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:41,416
Yes?

937
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:44,291
I saw the dog snack and the pillow.

938
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:47,291
No, no, no.
That was gourmet food from Balducci's.

939
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:49,291
That was a Tiffany Taylor pillow.

940
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:51,333
That pillow came over on the Mayflower.

941
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:55,708
That is… the only pillow
I can sleep on. That's my pillow.

942
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,000
I don't want to be like you.

943
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:01,791
You're a cynical, bitter, mean…

944
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,666
You don't like yourself.
You don't like life.

945
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:06,583
You're nasty to me.

946
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:10,875
You are the last person
in the world I want to be with.

947
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,666
You have nothing to offer.

948
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,916
Yeah, well, that's not true.
I have a lot to offer.

949
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,166
Like what?

950
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,208
Giving up on life?

951
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:23,625
Beating on weak people?
I'll be a big star, and you'll be nothing.

952
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,416
- Come on, shut up!
- Yeah!

953
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,625
Keep it down, shut up!

954
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,083
-We're trying to sleep.
-Wait a second. I'm coming down.

955
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:33,500
No, I came to tell you that it's over.
Forget it.

956
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:39,250
Here's the thing. I don't know how
you're going to put the movie together,

957
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:43,833
but there is an article in here that says

958
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,583
you have the right to change, alter, hire
additional writers, et cetera.

959
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:53,041
Well, for two mil plus ten points,
yeah, I would say…

960
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:56,458
It says here that, uh…
"after consultation with writer."

961
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,875
Yeah, well…
what if we don't agree?

962
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:00,791
Well,

963
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:04,375
then they have final say.
That's industry standard.

964
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:06,416
Yeah, see,

965
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:10,625
I have very specific ideas
about this movie,

966
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:13,500
industry standard or not.

967
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,541
-Sign the contract.
-OK.

968
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,333
‎-No arguments.
‎-Why?

969
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:20,500
Because we want the money!

970
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:24,416
You need it as same as me.
And you need your career back.

971
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,250
I don’t like this.

972
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:29,500
It makes me angry.

973
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:34,083
I want final say on the lead actress.

974
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:36,166
It's a great part.

975
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:39,291
She pees on the flowers. She talks funny.

976
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:42,750
They'll get you a sensitive director
and a top Hollywood actress. A star!

977
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,083
It's not right for a star.

978
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:47,875
Look, she's 23.
She's fresh. She's hopeful.

979
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:49,500
I mean, the whole point is
she hasn't been corrupted.

980
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:51,416
‎I mean, maybe she never will be.

981
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,791
It needs a fresh face. It needs…

982
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:57,666
It needs this one particular actress.

983
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:58,833
What actress?

984
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,500
Valerie Chipzik.

985
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:04,875
You walk one step,
you're a dead man, Jack.

986
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:08,791
You are agentless. You will never
be hired for anything ever again.

987
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:11,958
I will forego my fee.

988
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:16,458
I will forego my points.
Everything except for your ten percent.

989
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,541
Talk them into it.

990
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:21,625
You're good at that.

991
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,791
They'll never go for it.

992
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:31,166
Or maybe they will.

993
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:35,541
I am good.

994
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:38,166
Look at you. You're kind of famous.

995
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,541
What you need, Val, you need management.

996
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,291
Where are you going?

997
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:47,500
I am going to tender my resignation
at all my various places of employment,

998
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,208
and I am going to come back here,
and I am going to be your manager.

999
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:51,375
Come on, come on, come on.

1000
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:55,625
Look, sweetheart, it's going to be
strictly business, no romance.

1001
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,500
You always read these stories

1002
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:02,583
about how those pretty girls
just get discovered one day

1003
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,625
by wearing a tight sweater
in a drug store or something.

1004
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:10,333
But who discovers them?
Big producers go to drug-stores?

1005
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:13,708
I don't see why not. I mean, they have
to buy condoms, et cetera, et cetera.

1006
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:17,875
Why not? They have servants doing that.

1007
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,166
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

1008
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,375
I don't want to hear it.

1009
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,250
It has to do with your career.

1010
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:27,208
Save it.

1011
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:29,875
No, this may be actually important.

1012
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,708
Look, Edna, I've listened
to you long enough.

1013
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:36,208
You are a crazy person.
All you talk is nonsense.

1014
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:38,458
It doesn't add up,
but it's not even funny anymore.

1015
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:41,291
I came to New York with high hopes.

1016
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,750
High fucking hopes.

1017
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:47,250
And if this is all this city
has to offer me,

1018
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:50,791
the company
of a lesbo-psychopath like you,

1019
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:53,250
then I'm going back to France gladly,

1020
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:55,666
and thank my stars every minute that

1021
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:00,291
I can be a cocktail waitress
and get some tips in peace!

1022
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:01,750
What did you want to tell me?

1023
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:08,541
That woman sitting over there,
at that table over there…

1024
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,958
She's a very big agent.

1025
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,583
Great, good for her.

1026
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:17,041
Do you have a vacancy for a waitress here?

1027
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:20,083
I'm clean and organized
and well mannered. I'm calm.

1028
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:23,083
I know it doesn't seem that way right now,
but I'm very calm.

1029
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,875
I just need to make a few dollars
to buy a bus ticket back home.

1030
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:29,125
I don't mind long hours.
I come first and leave last,

1031
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:33,250
vacuum the floor, wash the dishes,
whatever you need. Blowjobs, no.

1032
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,083
Oh. We're not hiring at the moment.

1033
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:41,250
We're going
through a slow period right now.

1034
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:45,958
Yeah, me too. Well, I'll do one blowjob
a week, with a condom, and no emotions.

1035
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,500
That's my last offer.

1036
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:50,166
Excuse me, Ms.?

1037
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:52,208
Talking to me?

1038
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:54,291
Yes, what is your name?

1039
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:55,625
Chipzik.

1040
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:59,625
Chipzik? Are you sure?

1041
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm very, very excited. I'm so…

1042
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:08,125
How shall I put it?
Kaput mit exhiliration.

1043
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,541
Knock it off, sweetheart.

1044
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:13,125
The German accent already killed
your career once. Don't you ever learn?

1045
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:14,208
It was Swedish.

1046
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:15,541
Let's have a toast.

1047
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:20,416
I have a script here from one
of the world's legendary writers.

1048
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,083
It's a great script.

1049
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,958
It's a long shot
because you're an unknown,

1050
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:26,583
‎but I think it fits you like a glove.

1051
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:33,166
I draw my inspiration from Albert
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.

1052
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:37,083
There are no absolutes in the world
except for Absolut vodka.

1053
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:41,750
The rest is subjective and totally
dependent on the energy you put into it.

1054
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,125
Let's go.

1055
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:49,750
♪ I can dream, I can fly ♪

1056
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:54,000
♪ I can still touch the sky ♪

1057
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:58,333
♪ When it seems I might fall down ♪

1058
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:03,083
♪ When it seems no one's around ♪

1059
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:05,541
♪ To pick me up ♪

1060
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:09,583
♪ I can dream ♪

1061
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:13,833
♪ And think of you ♪

1062
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:18,083
♪ Close your eyes ♪

1063
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:22,666
♪ And dream it too ♪

1064
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,291
♪ With me ♪

1065
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:31,375
♪ But my life's not complete ♪

1066
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:35,500

‎♪ ‎Of hope‎ ♪

1069
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:57,125
Oh… Ah…

1070
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:59,958
And the winner is… Valerie Chipzik.

1071
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:03,375
I want to thank New York

1072
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:09,708
and America
for giving me this opportunity.

1073
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:13,583
God! Oh, baby you did it!

1074
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:15,958
Thank you.

1075
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,541
-Oh yeah, that was good.
-Oh yeah, yeah.

1076
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:21,375
That is my best friend!

1077
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:25,125
Is that really your best friend?

1078
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,208
Yeah.

1079
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:31,291
Then I guess a menage a trois
is out of the question.

1080
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,458
So she wins the Academy Award,

1081
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,875
becomes a big, gigantic star overnight,
and that's that.

1082
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:46,625
Film won best picture.
My screenplay wasn't even nominated.

1083
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:51,791
I got paid nothing. And that's
the last I ever heard from Val Chipzik.

1084
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,083
Now, do I feel hurt?

1085
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:58,375
No, life is meaningless,

1086
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:00,958
‎and that's a conclusion
‎that I've reached a long time ago.

1087
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,333
May I come in?

1088
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,333
Yes.

1089
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:57,916
What's this?

1090
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,791
Those are things I wrote over the years.

1091
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,250
I never really showed them to anybody.

1092
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:05,083
They were for big Hollywood projects.

1093
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:07,666
I had expected more of myself.

1094
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,250
I was 17 when I wrote My Life as a Boy.

1095
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:14,625
It became such a big success I thought I
must have done something really great.

1096
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,958
You did.

1097
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:18,125
No, I told the world how…

1098
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,583
my father didn't love my mother

1099
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:23,083
and how she hung herself
after shooting him twice in the head.

1100
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,666
I saw the movie. It was…

1101
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:31,041
Outstanding.

1102
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:33,958
So, what are you up to now?

1103
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,958
Biding my time,

1104
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,000
waiting for the post Academy Award offers.

1105
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:44,791
Oh yeah? That's smart, I guess.

1106
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:48,458
What do you want, Jack?

1107
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,291
Well…

1108
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,166
it feels strange now.

1109
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:59,083
Well, you were my inspiration, so…

1110
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:02,000
I have to ask myself,
will I always have to be shaken up

1111
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,416
for a limited amount of time in order to

1112
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,125
write a screenplay that sells popcorn?

1113
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:13,583
Then go back to being my dreary old self.

1114
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:20,916
Well, I'm glad you can sleep in the
Beverly Wilshire Hotel and the Plaza.

1115
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,166
I guess it gets
pretty cold outside in the wintertime.

1116
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,750
I'm not the Plaza type. And I hate LA.

1117
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:33,750
Goodbye, Jack.

1118
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:40,833
You did so much for me.

1119
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,291
More than anyone else, ever.

1120
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:47,750
I was just doing what was
good for my career.

1121
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:52,083
But you never told me.

1122
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:54,000
Told you what?

1123
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,875
That you love me.

1124
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,458
Well, that's not an easy thing to say.

1125
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,208
So long, Jack.

1126
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,458
Bye, Chipzik.

1127
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,458
Hello, Mother?

1128
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:25,166
This is me, Valerie.

1129
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:29,250
I just wanted to let you know that
I finally did make it.

1130
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:34,125
The role I play is somebody
very much like myself.

1131
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,583
How is your cold, Mother?

1132
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:43,000
You have to take better care of yourself.

1133
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:47,083
Yes, you do sound much better,
but even so,

1134
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:49,750
you mustn't go out at night,

1135
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:53,208
because you can get
a chill without even knowing it.

1136
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:58,500
I just want you
to take better care of yourself.

1137
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:01,416
Do it for me, Mama.

1138
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,541
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1139
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,833
Sometimes, at night, I sit outside,

1140
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,375
look at the sky and think about you.

1141
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,625
I have nowhere to go but up.

1142
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,416
But I wouldn't be anything without you.

1143
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,041
I couldn't sleep.

1144
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:51,416
Neither could I.

1145
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,958
May I?

1146
01:24:58,041 --> 01:24:59,208
Yup.

1147
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:26,791
I always wondered what was
so special about this garden.

1148
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,708
Don't expect too much.

1149
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:56,333
