00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:22,040
14 DAYS 12 NIGHTS

2
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,284
I believe your orphanage
can accommodate one more girl.

3
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,013
For the children, madam.

4
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,563
You can leave the child at the gate.

5
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,064
Tonight.

6
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,696
See that she's sent to the barbarians.

7
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,907
That's my only condition.

8
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:10,503
Hello! You timed your trip well.
The weather's been nice in Hanoi, lately.

9
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,048
Sorry, could you please ask him to stop?

10
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,306
OK, stop here, please.

11
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,148
This?

12
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,453
This lady is from Canada.

13
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,913
She adopted a child here.

14
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:18,293
She would like to meet Ms. Thao,
the woman who looked after her baby.

15
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,796
Please, come have some tea.

16
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,091
I'll get the person you're looking for.

17
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,844
We can wait in the foyer.

18
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,965
<i>Children are the voice of the world.</i>

19
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:57,100
<i>Without them,
our planet would have no future.</i>

20
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,109
On behalf of all our orphans,
thank you for your support.

21
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,952
Your certificate.

22
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,043
Do you have any information
regarding the child?

23
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,633
None. None at all.

24
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,087
It's been a long time.

25
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,632
Do you remember me?

26
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,187
This is for you.

27
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,404
Thank you. Have a seat.

28
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,420
I couldn't come to Vietnam
without visiting you.

29
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,732
This is Diêm Lê.

30
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,425
I never really had
a chance to thank you

31
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,886
for all you did for her.

32
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,072
For one whole year,
I raised her like my own.

33
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,657
I saw her take her first steps.

34
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,952
I saw her first smile.

35
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,644
She's asking why you came here.

36
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,641
That must be her!

37
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,321
Hi, Clara!

38
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,401
Translate, please.

39
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,618
These foreigners arrived one day.

40
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,581
They killed our parents
and stole our children.

41
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,887
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

42
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,267
How are you?

43
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,187
<i>I'm OK.</i>

44
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,695
<i>I miss you.</i>

45
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,990
I miss you too.

46
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,833
I went the orphanage today.

47
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,129
<i>Yeah? What was it like?</i>

48
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,052
<i>It hasn't changed at all.</i>

49
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,815
<i>Is it nice out?</i>

50
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,113
Yeah, it's nice out.

51
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm in Room 301.

52
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:42,347
What happened?

53
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,351
What happened?

54
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:54,025
No! Clara?

55
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,201
Clara? It's Mom!

56
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,960
The night your daughter
was left at the orphanage,

57
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,588
I found a piece of paper
in her clothing

58
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:24,634
with a name and a phone number
written on it.

59
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:50,452
She thinks that's the person who should be
informed of the child's death...

60
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,580
if you have the courage.

61
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:43,708
<i>Pardon me,</i>

62
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,960
<i>I'd like to speak with Thuy Nguyen.</i>

63
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,296
Thuy doesn't live here anymore.

64
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,423
Why are you looking for her?

65
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,634
<i>I need to ask her some questions.</i>

66
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,053
<i>Can you tell me how I can reach her?</i>

67
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,933
She works at Ly's Travel Agency.

68
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,519
You'll find her there.

69
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:18,678
WE ORGANIZE EXCURSIONS
WITH FRENCH-SPEAKING GUIDES

70
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,812
This portrait is the most famous work
of Tran Van Can,

71
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:11,606
one of the pioneers of
Vietnamese modern art.

72
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:15,193
Coincidentally, I have the same name
as the portrait's subject:

73
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,363
‟Em Thuy,” or ‟Little Thuy.”

74
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,078
<i>Is this your first time in Vietnam?</i>

75
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,287
<i>Yes.</i>

76
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:35,125
I had a very close Vietnamese friend
back home, in Canada.

77
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:43,383
He died last year.
I wanted to see his country.

78
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:46,511
I see.

79
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,766
Do you have any questions about
our itinerary for the next few days?

80
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,602
No. I trust you.
You're the expert.

81
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:55,997
This way.

82
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:30,490
Isabelle, I'd like you to meet
Maï and Sol.

83
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:32,033
They live here.

84
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,202
She's getting ready for
a school party.

85
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:35,912
- I see!
- Yes!

86
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,095
This is where we'll sleep.

87
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:06,609
This is my guest.

88
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,571
They own the property.

89
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:11,364
What are you up to today?

90
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:14,659
I'll probably go to the market

91
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:18,121
this afternoon.

92
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,789
We'll see you later.

93
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,769
What beautiful colours!

94
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,735
Around here,
business is women's work.

95
00:42:58,328 --> 00:42:59,704
The opening is small.

96
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:02,374
Yes, so your money doesn't fall out!

97
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:05,168
Hold it this way.
The money won't fall out.

98
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,921
Can you ask how much this scarf is?

99
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:09,756
How much for that?

100
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,966
- 400,000.
- 400?

101
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:15,261
It's 400,000. It's too expensive.
Let me deal with this.

102
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:17,847
I think it's worth 150.

103
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:22,644
That scarf is made of linen
that I wove by hand.

104
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,062
I have to charge more.

105
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:26,481
If you want something cheaper,
take this one.

106
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:30,235
- 200 for this one.
- No, I can't accept 200.

107
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:33,029
Then I'll go somewhere else.

108
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,407
No, I can't.

109
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:38,868
It's handwoven linen.

110
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,329
We wove it ourselves.

111
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:46,501
If she wants this one,
she can have it for 150.

112
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:48,253
- I think...
- Is 200 enough?

113
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,338
- Hold on. Let me look at it.
- 200.

114
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:53,049
This linen is from...

115
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:56,386
This linen is from the monks of Tau By.

116
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,389
It's a deal! 200,000.

117
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,517
200,000.

118
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,187
I'm not trying to rip you off!
It's worth more than 200,000.

119
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:12,402
It means ‟thank you.”

120
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,122
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

121
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,624
- It suits you.
- Thanks!

122
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:09,227
Do you smoke?

123
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:13,189
Yes. But I don't usually
smoke with clients.

124
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:16,985
Well, no one's going to tell on you,
especially not me.

125
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,570
All right. Thanks.

126
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,997
Was your Vietnamese friend
from the north or the south?

127
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,540
The south.

128
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:17,504
Do you know how to distinguish between
northerners and southerners in Vietnam?

129
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:22,050
Northerners like their coffee hot,
and southerners like it cold.

130
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:25,136
- Of course! Makes sense.
- Yep!

131
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:31,768
Also, we northerners are very thrifty
compared to southerners.

132
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,521
Southerners are big spenders.

133
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:39,234
They love going out.
They're very welcoming, very generous.

134
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:43,988
I'm not saying we're not generous
in the north, but...

135
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,324
Maybe it's the harsh climate...

136
00:47:46,908 --> 00:47:49,744
We keep our feelings to ourselves.

137
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:52,497
We're more introverted.

138
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:58,044
But once we open our doors,
it's like we're opening our hearts.

139
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,173
On the other hand,

140
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:06,553
if someone hurts us,
we're not very quick to forgive.

141
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,055
We tend to hold grudges.

142
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:36,166
- Are you married?
- Yes. You?

143
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,292
Yes.

144
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:38,960
What does your husband do?

145
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,173
My husband is an outdoorsman.

146
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:46,801
An outdoorsman?
What's that?

147
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:51,681
It's a man who loves being alone
and hunting and fishing

148
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:53,266
without his wife.

149
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,353
Sounds like a Vietnamese man!

150
00:48:58,313 --> 00:49:00,398
Is your husband an outdoorsman too?

151
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,942
No, he's not an outdoorsman.

152
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:05,737
I meant Vietnamese men in general.

153
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:07,906
My grandfather was a hunter.

154
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:09,366
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

155
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,368
What do people hunt in Vietnam?

156
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,995
Anything that moves!

157
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,416
What do people hunt in Quebec?

158
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:23,004
In Quebec, people hunt moose, partridges...

159
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:25,423
- Moose?
- Yeah, moose.

160
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:29,511
It's big. Very big.
It's bigger than a horse.

161
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:34,099
It has this big beard,
big eyes, long eyelashes...

162
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:38,978
It's beautiful and ugly all at once.
It depends.

163
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,065
How can it be both?

164
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:56,037
Go on, have some more.

165
00:49:58,456 --> 00:49:59,958
Well, here's to moose!

166
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:03,294
And to anything that moves!

167
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:22,981
Do you have any children?

168
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:34,159
Do you?

169
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:10,653
Good morning!

170
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:14,324
- Do you want some juice?
- Sure!

171
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:21,456
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah. You?

172
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:22,874
Yep!

173
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,425
- Are you working today?
- Just this afternoon.

174
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:48,233
- Here you go!
- Thanks!

175
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:56,199
Simon's here!

176
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:21,099
Hey! How's it going?

177
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:38,968
- Will you be back for dinner?
- Yep!

178
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,387
Yeah?

179
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:44,474
See you later!

180
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:03,887
Everything repeating itself,
day after day...

181
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:05,472
For me, that's God.

182
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,600
- Are you a Buddhist?
- No.

183
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:13,813
I'm a scientist. An oceanographer.

184
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:18,485
I've always been fascinated by the sea.

185
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:22,322
It's funny:
This place reminds me of home.

186
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:25,200
I didn't know you had
a Ha Long Bay in Quebec.

187
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,535
A more modest version!

188
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:44,469
See you at the back of the boat later?

189
00:58:44,482 --> 00:58:46,234
Are your parents from Hanoi?

190
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:50,989
My mother was.
My father was from central Vietnam.

191
00:58:55,076 --> 00:58:56,745
But I never knew them.

192
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:03,793
I'm sorry.

193
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:06,421
It's OK. You couldn't have known.

194
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:23,063
I was four months old
when the Americans bombed Hanoi.

195
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,152
I lost everyone:

196
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:32,113
my mother, my father,

197
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:35,700
my brother, my aunts and uncles,
my cousins...

198
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:47,462
They were all wiped out
by American bombs.

199
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:02,977
My grandmother, my great-uncle and I
were the only survivors.

200
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,273
I'm so sorry.

201
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,277
My grandmother raised me.

202
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:31,668
Take us to Ninh Binh.

203
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,628
- Now?
- Yes.

204
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,843
I have a surprise for you.

205
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:26,181
Welcome to my home!

206
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,142
Don't look at me like that.

207
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:33,646
You're my guest!
We'll go to Hanoi tomorrow.

208
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:53,958
Come!

209
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:27,492
Please, come in!

210
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:39,462
That's my great-uncle,
the one I mentioned.

211
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:47,929
What was his name?

212
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:49,139
Uncle Lam.

213
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,807
He was a painter.

214
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,019
You come from a family of artists?

215
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,062
No. He was the exception.

216
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,232
I come from a family of doctors.

217
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:04,487
My grandmother raised me in her own image,

218
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:07,824
while my uncle invited me
into his studio.

219
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,412
He taught in Hanoi, at the art school.

220
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:20,045
This was his oasis.
I spent every summer here.

221
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:26,301
Who knows where I'd be
if it weren't for him.

222
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:29,888
I owe it all to him:

223
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:32,140
my culture, my passion for art,

224
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:35,977
my studies in fine arts,
my love for Paris.

225
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,064
I must be boring you with my stories.

226
01:05:39,105 --> 01:05:40,398
No, not at all!

227
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,526
It's weird: When I speak French,
I'm chatty.

228
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:45,612
When I speak Vietnamese,
I clam up.

229
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,721
Is that you in the photos?

230
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:13,515
Yes.

231
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:06,026
Have you lived here long?

232
01:07:07,652 --> 01:07:11,489
Ten years or so.
Since my great uncle died.

233
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,869
He left everything to me.

234
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:22,792
Now, I work as a guide
for the first half of the year,

235
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:25,962
then I come here to be an artist
for the second half.

236
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:36,014
When I started art school,
everything Uncle Lam had said was true.

237
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:39,768
I was raised in such a rigid world.

238
01:07:39,809 --> 01:07:44,147
Suddenly, I entered a world of freedom
where anything was possible.

239
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:48,568
I could finally breathe, live!

240
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:00,372
Let me show you
where you'll sleep tonight.

241
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,476
This is my studio.

242
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:14,070
I like your work.

243
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:50,357
When I was 17,
I fell in love with my art teacher.

244
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:54,694
He was 30, and he was French.

245
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:07,624
In my grandmother's opinion,
I had slept with the enemy...

246
01:10:12,879 --> 01:10:17,175
the same enemy that killed her husband
during the Indochina War.

247
01:10:22,013 --> 01:10:26,017
I was the whore who dishonoured
our family and our country.

248
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,604
I got pregnant...

249
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:34,025
and my grandmother decided...

250
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:38,697
to bring me to the country to give birth.

251
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,408
And I never saw my daughter again.

252
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:53,044
I didn't give her up.

253
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:56,297
She was taken from me.

254
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:02,762
I'm sorry.

255
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:40,568
You never had this child.

256
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,511
Isabelle?

257
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:53,011
Isabelle? I looked everywhere for you!

258
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:55,847
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

259
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:01,269
Are you sure?
You don't look fine.

260
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,022
I need to talk to you.

261
01:16:16,826 --> 01:16:18,036
Go on.

262
01:16:23,124 --> 01:16:24,709
I lied to you.

263
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:38,223
I'm not who you think I am.

264
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:05,208
I adopted your daughter in 1991.

265
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,543
My husband and I.

266
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:44,414
I'm sorry.

267
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:50,128
Last year...

268
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:05,226
she was in an accident, and...

269
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:25,080
and she died in the accident.

270
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:35,715
I'm sorry.

271
01:18:36,299 --> 01:18:39,260
I wanted to tell you so many times, but...

272
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,103
I guess I didn't have the courage.

273
01:19:09,749 --> 01:19:11,334
Please forgive me.

274
01:19:22,804 --> 01:19:24,639
For days now,

275
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:29,644
you've been watching me...

276
01:19:30,895 --> 01:19:32,564
spying on me!

277
01:19:51,374 --> 01:19:53,084
You took advantage of me!

278
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:54,461
Forgive me.

279
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:56,046
Of my trust!

280
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:58,965
Forgive me.

281
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,216
Of my private life!

282
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:01,801
Forgive me.

283
01:20:08,308 --> 01:20:10,018
What was I to you?

284
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:15,815
A puppet prattling on about Vietnam?

285
01:20:18,943 --> 01:20:20,695
You were part of my life...

286
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:25,367
part of my little Clara.

287
01:20:28,536 --> 01:20:31,706
That's what we named her: Clara.

288
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:09,452
Oftentimes, I allowed myself to
imagine her life.

289
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,087
But never her death.

290
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,554
I hope you'll be able to
forgive me one day.

291
01:24:17,223 --> 01:24:18,975
There's nothing to forgive.

292
01:24:19,976 --> 01:24:21,686
Clara was your daughter too.

293
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:26,941
You gave her a better life.

294
01:24:31,821 --> 01:24:33,865
I wish I had done a better job.

295
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:38,078
I know.

296
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:32,794
ANTHOLOGY OF VIETNAMESE POETRY

297
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:58,945
You took my daughter from me!

298
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:00,613
You're forgetting...

299
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:04,993
that I gave you the opportunity
to start over.

300
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,245
You did nothing for me!

301
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:12,125
Everything you do,
you do it for yourself!

302
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:16,463
You never accepted me

303
01:28:17,505 --> 01:28:19,090
with my daughter.

304
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:24,346
You never accepted
that I loved her father...

305
01:28:26,514 --> 01:28:28,808
that I loved a White man.

306
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:32,395
You think he's a barbarian
because he's not like us.

307
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:36,566
I mourned him when he left...

308
01:28:38,651 --> 01:28:42,238
and now I mourn my daughter,
who's no longer among the living.

309
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:49,162
For a long time now,
I've been asking you to forgive me

310
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:54,209
and to recognize my daughter
as your own granddaughter.

311
01:28:58,088 --> 01:29:00,131
Grandmother, recognize us,

312
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:04,344
so my daughter's soul
can enter heaven,

313
01:29:05,178 --> 01:29:09,432
so we can finally
make peace with the past.

314
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:41,251
CLARA, BE OUR ANGEL.
PROTECT US.

315
01:39:24,589 --> 01:39:27,592
