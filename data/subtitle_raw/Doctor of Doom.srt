00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,413
(suspenseful orchestral music)

00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:05,080
(feet stepping)

3
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:13,156
(monster growls)

4
00:00:13,156 --> 00:00:14,795
(woman screams)

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:15,628
(audience yelling)

6
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:18,545
(bodies scuffling)

7
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:24,832
(bodies scuffling)

8
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:29,446
(audience cheers)

9
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,698
(audience cheering)

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,475
(audience cheering)

11
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:49,392
(bodies scuffling)

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,273
(audience cheering)

13
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:54,190
(bodies scuffling)

14
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,911
(audience cheering)

15
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:10,674
(audience cheering)

16
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:15,453
(audience cheering)

17
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:19,335
(audience cheering)

18
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:25,354
(bodies scuffling)

19
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:31,329
(audience cheering)

20
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,679
(audience shouts)

21
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:43,186
(bodies scuffling)

22
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,019
(audience shouts)

23
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:50,993
(bodies scuffling)

24
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:53,826
(audience shouts)

25
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:59,309
(audience cheers)

26
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:02,142
(audience shouts)

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,666
(audience shouts)

28
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:12,824
(bodies scuffling)

29
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:18,758
(audience cheers)

30
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,391
(audience applauds)

31
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,980
(Gloria exhales)

32
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,813
- For a moment there,

33
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,400
I thought you were going to lose tonight.

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,475
- I'd hate to be called a braggart,

35
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:36,393
but up to now, no woman has pinned me.

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,470
Let me take a short
shower, will you, honey?

37
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,063
And then we'll go out to supper.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,940
- You know something, Gloria?

39
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,590
If I were you, I'd be afraid
of getting my arm broken.

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,618
- You never can tell. (laughs)

41
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:50,201
(woman laughs)

42
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,835
(ventilator breathing)

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,930
- All set.

44
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,330
We'll operate immediately.

45
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,720
- Right, Doctor.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,770
You can bring her in.

47
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,087
(suspenseful orchestral music)

48
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,522
(electricity buzzing)

49
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:42,095
(electricity buzzing)

50
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:48,680
(suspenseful orchestral music)

51
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,400
(electricity buzzing)

52
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:01,711
(electricity buzzing)

53
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,085
(electricity buzzing)

54
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,861
(sad orchestral music)

55
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,893
- Another failure.

56
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,690
And this makes the fourth one

57
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,383
For a moment, he fought to go on living.

58
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,403
Only one thing could have caused this.

59
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,660
The brain I transplanted
wasn't strong enough

60
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,410
to resist the shock.

61
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,850
- All of the brains that we've
tried to transplant up to now

62
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,400
have come from totally uneducated women.

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
They had no preparation whatsoever,

64
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,533
and their IQs were extremely low.

65
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,070
Don't you believe that
we'd achieve better results

66
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,570
from a superior brain, with a high IQ,

67
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,320
from a young and intelligent woman?

68
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,030
- I couldn't be absolutely sure about it,

69
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,630
but there is a strong
possibility that you're right.

70
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,020
Anyway, we're going to go on trying

71
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,614
until we overcome all the obstacles.

72
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,290
(creature growls)

73
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,900
Gomar is acting up again.

74
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
We better go look in on him.

75
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,911
(Gomar growling)

76
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,830
(suspenseful orchestral music)

77
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,070
(Gomar growls)

78
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,280
Quiet down, Gomar!

79
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,133
Quiet, I say!

80
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,523
This is my greatest achievement so far.

81
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,580
Half-man and half-beast.

82
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,413
- But doctor--

83
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:00,246
- Yes, I know.

84
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,060
I've done what no one
else has been able to do.

85
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,910
I've transplanted a gorilla's brain

86
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,210
into a living human being.

87
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,163
It's time he was fed.

88
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:11,798
Get back, Gomar!

89
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,003
Get back!

90
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:15,290
(Gomar growls)

91
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,470
Do as I say!

92
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,445
(Gomar growls)

93
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:20,710
(meat thuds)

94
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,050
There you have the
results of our experiment.

95
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,770
This man has been going through a slow

96
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,330
but relentless transformation,

97
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,030
indicating that the animal instincts

98
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,150
and characteristics are
starting to predominate

99
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,410
in this symbiotic relationship.

100
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,880
In a little more time now,

101
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
the metamorphosis will be complete.

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,876
- Do you mean that he'll
eventually become a 100% gorilla?

103
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:44,490
(Gomar munching)

104
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,760
- Quiet down!

105
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,593
Quiet, Gomar!

106
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:50,440
Do as I say!

107
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,361
Quiet down!

108
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:52,194
(Gomar growls)

109
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:54,203
I'm not going to take that
to meat away from you.

110
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,000
Calm down now.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,646
Calm down.

112
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,696
You can go on eating.

113
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,500
The only reason he obeys me now

114
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,600
is because I have him in a hypnotic state.

115
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,010
But sooner or later,

116
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,203
I'll undoubtedly lose
all control over him.

117
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,074
(Gomar growls)

118
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:11,907
Calm down.

119
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:13,756
Go on eating, Gomar.

120
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,533
Go on eating.

121
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,883
I must continue to make progress.

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,823
I can't stop here.

123
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:27,810
(door locking)

124
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,250
I must transplant a human
brain into another human being.

125
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,300
That's the goal that I've set for myself.

126
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,230
Unfortunately, the human
metabolism is quite weak

127
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,147
as compared to that of animals.

128
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,720
But in my opinion,

129
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,690
the female of our species

130
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,343
reacts more positively
in these experiments,

131
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,040
for many biological reasons.

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,240
- When will we make
another attempt, Doctor?

133
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,000
As soon as we find someone
that fills our needs.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,340
- You mean an intellectual woman?

135
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,623
- Could be.

136
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,697
Perhaps one that selected
a professional career.

137
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:06,880
(door closes)

138
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,280
- Extra, extra!

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,610
Another woman murdered by the Mad Doctor!

140
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,460
Paper, sir?

141
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,630
Extra, extra!

142
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,647
Police say criminal still at large!

143
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:16,280
[Vendor] Extra, extra!

144
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,610
The Mad Doctor claims a fourth victim!

145
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,580
- Go out and get me a
paper, will you, please?

146
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,630
- Certainly, glad to.

147
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:29,035
- Good morning, Boris.

148
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,010
- Good morning, Professor.

149
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,694
- Good morning, how are you today?

150
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:35,527
- Good morning, Professor.

151
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,720
- The things that are going on

152
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,520
in this city lately are hideous.

153
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,353
Hmm?

154
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:51,780
And did you go out last night, Alice?

155
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,770
- Yes, Professor.

156
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,350
I watched my sister wrestle a while

157
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,640
and we had supper together.

158
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,900
- Hmm.

159
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,180
- Have you ever watched a
wrestling match, professor?

160
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,013
- Hmm?

161
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:00,860
Oh, no.

162
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,840
You must know that I simply
abhor violence, Alice.

163
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,560
It disgusts me.

164
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,550
- It's really a fantastic sport, sir.

165
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,556
And I think you'd enjoy
it once you saw it.

166
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:11,233
- No, I couldn't bear it.

167
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,763
Did you two stay up late?

168
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,800
- Till midnight, I think.

169
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,460
- And did your fiance accompany
you to watch the wrestling?

170
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,560
- Well, there's a certain boy

171
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,020
that I've been out with on occasion.

172
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,360
But last night, he worked.

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,490
So I'm afraid no one took us home.

174
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,693
- But two women alone could be in danger.

175
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,140
Surely, you read all about that
criminal killer in the city,

176
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,572
we call the Mad Doctor.

177
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,590
- (laughs) And don't you
worry about it, Professor.

178
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,804
That animal can do me no harm.

179
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,202
- Oh, no?

180
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,202
And why not?

181
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:41,720
- (chuckles) I wear my little
rabbit's foot, you know?

182
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,606
I'm perfectly safe,
wearing this. (chuckles)

183
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:45,439
- It makes me so mad

184
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,720
when I hear a girl start
to joke about this.

185
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,270
It's just incredible, the
happenings in the city lately.

186
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,160
There's no protection.

187
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,310
There are no guarantees.

188
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,180
And yet you girls--
- Professor!

189
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,610
- Yes.

190
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,590
Run an analysis on this,

191
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,850
and I'll be back for it.

192
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,952
- I'll get to work on it, Professor.

193
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,452
- Fine, thank you.

194
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,450
- Professor, the medicine
you ordered a few weeks ago

195
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,283
finally got here.

196
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,229
Can you check it now?

197
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,062
- Oh, yes.

198
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:09,930
Yes, I'll go out and sign for it.

199
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,763
Thank you, Boris.

200
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:11,811
Thank you.

201
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:15,723
Alice, I'll say more about this later.

202
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:18,503
- Reports show that these
nocturnal acts are continuing

203
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:19,883
and the police are still accusing

204
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:23,120
that criminal who's caused
so much public discussion.

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,670
Due to his actions, he's
been named the Mad Doctor.

206
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,850
The woman he killed last
night is in the morgue.

207
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,360
She was found early this
morning, and as always happened,

208
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,390
police found marks showing
that the brain had been removed

209
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,040
from the unfortunate girl's body.

210
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,130
They admit that the
case is a mystery still,

211
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,630
but they'll work until
they run across a solution.

212
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,120
- Any news?

213
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,510
- No, there's still not a thing.

214
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,790
I questioned several persons

215
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,470
who went there to see the corpse,

216
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,623
but no one could give us any information.

217
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,320
- I only say that this particular
criminal is disconcerting.

218
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,930
He's an excellent surgeon,

219
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,948
and the proof lies in the perfection

220
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,973
of the operations that he carried out.

221
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,930
He certainly knows his job,

222
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,330
but just why is he doing it?

223
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,253
I'm at a loss to find any motivation.

224
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,970
Is he a sadist, some madman?

225
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,610
- Well, we investigated all the doctors

226
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,770
in the medical profession,

227
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,850
and we questioned several,

228
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,370
but got no results at all.

229
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,920
- And for as long as he's on the loose

230
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,300
it'll mean he's a threat to society.

231
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,160
This criminal has to be found,

232
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,133
otherwise these attacks will continue.

233
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:33,224
- What are you gonna do?

234
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:35,820
- I'm going to phone my
grandmother, make her stay home.

235
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,990
No use inviting bad luck.

236
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,083
Grandma can't hear.

237
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,793
Grandma, dear!

238
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,293
Don't go out tonight!

239
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:51,739
(ominous orchestral music)

240
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,720
- My experiment must not be held up,

241
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,080
so you're going to look for another woman.

242
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,650
- But, Chief, the police are
coming too close for comfort.

243
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,390
They might catch us.

244
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,760
- There are a lot of patrols out,

245
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,980
watching all the principal highways,

246
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,810
and they're searching all the cars.

247
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,860
- Silence.

248
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,190
You're going to do exactly as I order you,

249
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,573
and Gomar will go with you.

250
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,300
- So he goes.

251
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,660
You mean that he can't be hurt by bullets?

252
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,350
- Certainly he can,

253
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,430
but I've foreseen that possibility,

254
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,590
so he'll be wearing special equipment.

255
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,320
No one will be able to stop him,

256
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,620
so you men have nothing
at all to worry about.

257
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:40,441
Gomar,

258
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,293
those men are your
friends, your good friends.

259
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,451
You will obey them.

260
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,783
You will obey them,

261
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,223
because they are your friends.

262
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,393
Listen, Chief,

263
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,240
who is the next woman?

264
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,300
Do you want us to get
any one in particular?

265
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,170
- Yes.

266
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,320
This is her photograph.

267
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:16,716
(dramatic orchestral music)

268
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,790
(gate closes)

269
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,020
- Goodnight, Boris.

270
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,170
- Goodnight, Professor.

271
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:28,330
- Goodnight, Alice.

272
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,210
Hadn't you better go?

273
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,800
It's getting awfully late,

274
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,750
and no one told you to
stay here all night.

275
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,030
- I know, only I wanted to
get this experiment done.

276
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,790
- Ah, what an eager little girl.

277
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,703
Now, you remind me to raise your salary.

278
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:40,536
(Alice chuckles)

279
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:41,369
But I want you to go now.

280
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,510
And another thing, I'm
going to a accompany you.

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,530
- Oh, no, there's no need for that.

282
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,540
I'll just grab a cab, and
I'll be home in 10 minutes.

283
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,230
- Yes, Alice, but I think I should--

284
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,732
- Now, don't insist, Professor.

285
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,343
The night air is pretty cold,

286
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:53,193
and I don't want you to catch a cold.

287
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:58,394
See you tomorrow, sir.

288
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:59,490
- Goodnight, Alice.

289
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,630
Have a pleasant evening, Boris.

290
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,913
- Why, thank you, Alice.

291
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,383
Goodnight now.

292
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,800
(door shuts)

293
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:12,252
(light orchestral music)

294
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:17,036
(menacing orchestral music)

295
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:24,354
(menacing orchestral music)

296
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:30,330
(Alice screams)

297
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:41,136
(ominous orchestral music)

298
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:44,271
(doors shutting)

299
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,938
(dramatic orchestral music)

300
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,610
- Gomar, those men are enemies!

301
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,860
Go after them, and hurry!

302
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:03,897
- Stop!

303
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:04,868
Who are you?

304
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:05,701
Answer me!

305
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,655
You all stop right there, or I'll fire!

306
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,388
(guns firing)

307
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,888
(guns firing)

308
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,166
(policeman groans)

309
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,365
(guns firing)

310
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:23,929
(fist punches)

311
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:24,847
(policeman grunts)

312
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,428
(body thuds)

313
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:29,845
(body thuds)

314
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,801
(body thuds)

315
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,720
- Gomar, Gomar!

316
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,162
Let's get outta here, pronto!

317
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:40,349
(body thuds)

318
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:44,016
(exciting orchestral music)

319
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,539
(buzzer buzzing)

320
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,640
- The boys have brought the woman in.

321
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,473
- Good.

322
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:04,600
Get everything ready to operate.

323
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,740
- Chief, Gomar really moves fast.

324
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,100
He battered those police around
like so many clay pigeons.

325
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,070
- You did a good job, Gomar.

326
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,480
You will go now.

327
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,383
Take him along.

328
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:39,358
(suspenseful orchestral music)

329
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:43,133
(oxygen pumping)

330
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,840
- She's not going to pull through.

331
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,823
She's dying.

332
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,597
- Hurry, get the Coramine.

333
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:06,661
(suspenseful orchestral music)

334
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,259
(oxygen hissing)

335
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,020
One failure after another, Boris.

336
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,240
- The operation is
tremendously difficult, Doctor.

337
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,990
- Isn't there any human being
that can stand the shock?

338
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,990
- Perhaps a stronger type
of woman, an athlete,

339
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,670
one that can take more
punishment than the average.

340
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,790
If we could find a
woman like that, Doctor,

341
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,863
she'd probably live through the operation.

342
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,910
- Four policemen torn to pieces

343
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,950
by strange beast.

344
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,803
Police completely confused.

345
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,670
- Chief, we identified
the girl he murdered.

346
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,503
- Perfect.

347
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:20,336
Only who is she?

348
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,473
- It's in my book.

349
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,300
Alice Fontaine.

350
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,560
- That name sounds French.

351
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,710
- Who asked you?

352
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,970
Was another girl living with her?

353
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,863
- No one else.

354
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,173
- Her family?

355
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,743
- A sister, whom she saw frequently.

356
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,830
Who's Gloria Venus?

357
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,790
- That's her, there.

358
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,623
- Thank you.

359
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,430
- Come on, girls!

360
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,590
- Gloria Venus?

361
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,423
- Yes?

362
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,980
- I'm from headquarters.

363
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,120
I'm sorry that it's my duty

364
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,860
to bring you this bad news, Miss.

365
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,973
- I don't understand.

366
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,873
- It's your sister.

367
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:13,170
- Is she sick?

368
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,774
- She suffered a very bad accident.

369
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:15,880
- (gasps) Alice was hurt?

370
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,971
- Would you accompany me, please?

371
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:19,330
- To the doctor?

372
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,662
- To identify her.

373
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:22,689
(Gloria gasps)

374
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:26,356
(dramatic orchestral music)

375
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:38,574
(suspenseful orchestral music)

376
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,779
(Gloria gasps)

377
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,279
(Gloria sobs)

378
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,620
- Last night, Alice left
much later than usual.

379
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,390
I offered to accompany her to her house,

380
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,933
but she said she'd go alone.

381
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,360
She said she would go in a taxi.

382
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,535
Oh, this thing is just horrible.

383
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:14,950
- Poor girl.

384
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,220
- It's too bad you don't have other things

385
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,560
to tell us, Professor.

386
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,610
There's no evidence to help us.

387
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,110
- We could find out whether
she took a taxi or not.

388
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,460
- It's obvious she didn't.

389
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,920
But anyway, Tommy, you
and I will check that.

390
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,630
- Just what is that maniac trying to do,

391
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,573
operating on all those women that way?

392
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,730
- I'd sure like to find
out why, Professor.

393
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,320
You see, we think this
surgery is behind it all.

394
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,530
- I just can't tell you
how sorry I feel, Gloria,

395
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,643
about Alice's death.

396
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,450
I adored her, as I would a daughter.

397
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,980
I want to help you if I can.

398
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,730
So please don't fail to call on me.

399
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,920
- Thank you, Professor.

400
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,610
And should you run across more facts,

401
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,810
I'd like for you to inform me.

402
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,940
- Oh yes, yes, yes, of course.

403
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,180
- I swear not to rest

404
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,240
until I find the one who
killed my poor sister.

405
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,990
I won't let the killer get away this time.

406
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,460
- Don't worry.

407
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,153
Have faith in the local police.

408
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,097
The thing is,

409
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:15,513
we don't have the smallest
bit of evidence to work on.

410
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,183
But sooner or later,

411
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,250
the man we're trying to hunt down

412
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,160
is going to commit an error.

413
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,840
And when he does, we'll get him.

414
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,020
- Yes, that's true.

415
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,410
- It's simply useless to go on

416
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,780
with the experiments in this way.

417
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,130
All the women have died
on the operating table.

418
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,000
- Let's say your right, Chief,

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,150
then what will you do?

420
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,030
- We've got to find women with
incredible physical stamina.

421
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,360
But at the moment, I must admit

422
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,860
that I don't know where
to start to look for them.

423
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:48,195
(bodies thumping)

424
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,943
- One moment!

425
00:22:52,943 --> 00:22:53,900
Please, girls, one moment!

426
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,100
This is very important.

427
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,530
Now listen to me.

428
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,960
I'd like you to meet another young lady

429
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,880
who's spent many years
in the wrestling game.

430
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,020
She's come here today to join you.

431
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,600
This is Golden Ruby.

432
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,330
Ruby, I'd like to take this
opportunity to introduce you

433
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,220
to our star wrestler, Gloria Venus.

434
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,207
- It's a pleasure to know you.

435
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,460
- The pleasure is mine.

436
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,780
- Ruby came to start training.

437
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,380
She'll have a match very soon.

438
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,377
I hope you take time out to work with her

439
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:18,020
and show her all the things you know.

440
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,780
- I'd be glad to, Dick.

441
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,210
- Fine, and I'd like to thank you.

442
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,150
I must be going.

443
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,560
Good luck, Ruby.
- Thanks a lot.

444
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,680
- Shall we get to work?

445
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,763
- Whatever you say.

446
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:30,860
(body thuds)

447
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,810
- What are you doing here?

448
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,963
- I want those weights there.

449
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:33,796
- You can't have them, they're ours!

450
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:34,821
- Don't give me orders!

451
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,238
(body thuds)

452
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:39,578
(body thuds)

453
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:41,995
(man groans)

454
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:45,093
(man groans)

455
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:47,510
(body thuds)

456
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:52,129
(body thuds)

457
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,102
(Ruby laughing)

458
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,736
(both laughing)

459
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:01,236
(phone rings)

460
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,412
- Inspector Rogers.

461
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,800
No, there's no more information as yet.

462
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,633
Call later.

463
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,020
These reporters are like locusts.

464
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,260
Anything new?

465
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,850
- Not one clue.

466
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,090
She could have climbed into a car,

467
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,583
only I know it wasn't a taxi.

468
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,530
We investigated the drivers and nothing.

469
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,510
- I only know that this case

470
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,030
would make a mad man sane, Chief.

471
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,310
There's no evidence, no motives, nothing.

472
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,120
No one knows who the man is either.

473
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,770
- The only thing we can do is wait.

474
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,923
- For another crime?

475
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:37,487
(Gloria sighs)

476
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:41,250
- There are really some
fine wrestlers here, Gloria.

477
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,500
I won't win easily, I know that.

478
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,430
- Hey, that's just modesty.

479
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,240
You know your business, I could see it.

480
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,380
- Know something?

481
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,140
I've watched you, and your
eyes have such a sad look.

482
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,493
Tell me, is anything wrong?

483
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,483
- No.

484
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,970
Well, all right.

485
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,860
My poor sister, it's just
something I can't forget.

486
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,623
They murdered her three nights ago.

487
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:04,020
- (gasps) I'm so sorry.

488
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,910
Forgive me, but I really--

489
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,430
- No, I don't want you
to feel bad about it.

490
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,570
- But, but if there's
anything I can do to help.

491
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,610
- Thank you.

492
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,860
You're a real swell girl.

493
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,020
Are you staying nearby here, Ruby?

494
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,470
- At the Splendid Hotel.

495
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,303
Why?

496
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,470
My new apartment is large,
and you must be lonely.

497
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,300
I thought maybe you'd like
to come and live there.

498
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,000
- I'd be delighted to.

499
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,570
But don't you think I'd turn
out to be a burden, Gloria?

500
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,403
- Course not.

501
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:30,800
And actually, you'd be doing me a favor,

502
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,830
'cause now more than ever,

503
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,570
I need someone else around me.

504
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,463
- Well, in that case, it's a deal.

505
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:38,960
(crowd chatters)

506
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,600
- Tonight, at two falls
with no time limits,

507
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,870
we present the American cyclone,

508
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,410
The Golden Ruby,

509
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,313
teaming with Gloria Venus,

510
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,540
fighting against The
Gazelle and Bertha Galindo!

511
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:01,845
(crowd chatters)

512
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:07,447
(audience shouting)

513
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:09,864
(body thuds)

514
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:16,825
(audience cheering)

515
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,325
(body thumps)

516
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,470
(body thumps)

517
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,007
(body thuds)

518
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:29,090
(audience whistling)

519
00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:37,330
(bodies thumping)

520
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,249
(audience cheers)

521
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:43,649
(fist thumps)

522
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:47,255
(audience cheers)

523
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:49,922
(body thumping)

524
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:52,876
(fist thumps)

525
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:55,114
(foot thumps)

526
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,110
(audience cheers)

527
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,670
- Why did you bring me here?

528
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,810
- Because we could run across some clues.

529
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,210
- Yeah, sure it could.

530
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,960
You wanted to watch Gloria wrestle.

531
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:07,330
- It could be.

532
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,303
- Well, well, you better watch out

533
00:27:08,303 --> 00:27:09,670
and not get fresh with her,

534
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,570
because she'll put her
foot in your mouth, sonny.

535
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,483
And so long teeth.

536
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,780
You'd be pretty, talking
like this. (laughs)

537
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,703
- Quiet down, short stuff.

538
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:22,689
(audience cheering)

539
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:29,002
- Boo!

540
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:30,925
Boo!

541
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:36,234
(crowd cheering)

542
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:40,780
Boo!

543
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,613
Well, join in!

544
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:42,530
Boo!
- Boo!

545
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,359
(crowd cheering)

546
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,817
(body thuds)

547
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:54,567
(audience claps)

548
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:04,249
(fist thumps)

549
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:08,566
(audience boos)

550
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,889
(body thumps)

551
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,333
(audience cheers)

552
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:33,088

553
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,573
(body thumps)

554
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:38,573
(audience clapping)

555
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:46,658
(audience applauds)

556
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:52,437
(audience yelling)

00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:55,270

00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,947
(body crashing)

560

(bodies thudding)

561
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:16,629
(body thuds)

(body thuds)

00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:53,763
(body thuds)

571
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,512
(audience cheers)

572
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,118
(body thuds)

573
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,991
(body thuds)

574
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,163
- Get back there.

575
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,177
Go on!

576
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:17,010
Go on!

577
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:21,734
(audience yelling)

578
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:23,153
- Boo!

579
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:23,986
- Boo!

580
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:29,730
(body slams)

581
00:30:31,593 --> 00:30:33,585

00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:36,214

(audience yelling)

584
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:39,811
(body thuds)

585
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:42,926
(body thuds)

586
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,843
(audience yelling)

587
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:50,108
(body thumps)

(body thumps)

589
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,313
(body thumps)

590
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:04,822
(audience cheering)

591
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:12,175
(audience applauds)

592
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:21,857
(door knocks)

593
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:23,440
- Come in.

594
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,270
Oh, Professor Wright.

595
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,417
What a pleasant surprise
to have a visit from you.

596
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:32,490
I'd like you to meet my
teammate, The Golden Ruby.

597
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,350
- It's a pleasure indeed, young lady.

598
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,183
- Hello.

599
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:36,660
Did you like the fight, Professor?

600
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,590
I'm sorry to say it,

601
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,853
but I don't look such spectacles.

602
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:43,190
- May I come in?

603
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,350
- Sure.

604
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,183
- Thank you.

605
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:46,016
- Me too?

606
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:46,849
- Good evening, sir, how are you?

607
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:47,682
- Of course.

608
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:49,010
I'd like to introduce Mike Henderson

609
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,050
and his assistant here, Tommy Johnson.

610
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,130
The Golden Ruby.

611
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,480
- Hello there, how are you?

612
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,410
- Delighted.

613
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,246
- Not as delighted as I am, sweetheart.

614
00:31:58,246 --> 00:31:59,079
(Tommy groans)

615
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,095
(knuckles cracking)

616
00:32:00,095 --> 00:32:01,540
(group laughs)

617
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,373
- Who would have thought

618
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:03,510
that you'd like wrestling, Professor?

619
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,020
- I just can't bear it really.

620
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,900
It's more than I can take.

621
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,300
I only came here because
I wanted to tell you

622
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,520
certain facts that I
just remembered tonight.

623
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,353
- Really?

624
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:13,790
- About Alice, Professor?

625
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,946
- Uh, Yes.

626
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:17,000
I remember that she spoke about

627
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,810
a boy that she was seeing on occasion,

628
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,380
after work, I guess.

629
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,160
- Did she tell you his name, sir?

630
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,423
- Uh, no,

631
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,313
but I thought that
might help you a little.

632
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,970
- A little or a lot, it's still something.

633
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,803
- It's possible.

634
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:32,270
Many thanks, Professor.

635
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,470
I'll investigate this man tomorrow, sir.

636
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,710
- (chuckles) I'd like you to know

637
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,420
that I'm always ready to assist you.

638
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,600
You don't know how I itch

639
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,200
to get my hands on that fool maniac.

640
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,730
- I understand, sir.

641
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,380
- Well, I'll be saying goodnight now.

642
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,263
I must be going.

643
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,096
- Well, good night, Professor.

644
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:46,929
- Excuse me, please.

645
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:47,762
- Pleased to know you.

646
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:49,430
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

647
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:54,020
- Girls, Tommy wants to invite
you to supper and dancing.

648
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,880
- Who?

649
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,713
- How about it?

650
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:56,546
- I think that's great!

651
00:32:56,546 --> 00:32:58,030
- What are we waiting for?

652
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,863
- Perfect.

653
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,133
- She has plans for me.

654
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:09,179
(suspenseful orchestral music)

655
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:13,830
(window rattling)

656
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:25,911
(suspenseful orchestral music)

657
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,796
(body thumps)

658
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:42,927
(fist punches)

659
00:33:42,927 --> 00:33:44,858
(exciting orchestral music)

660
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,358
(body thumps)

661
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:51,834
(body thumps)

662
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:54,584
(fists punching)

663
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,811
(fists punching)

664
00:34:01,242 --> 00:34:02,906
(fist punches)

665
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,312
(body thumps)

666
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:07,823
(fists punching)

667
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:11,069
(fist punches)

668
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:12,830
- No, they might have more out there!

669
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,663
Stay right here.

670
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,690
- Are you all right?

671
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,530
They didn't hurt your arm, did they?

672
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,363
- No.

673
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,220
- But look, Chief,

674
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,870
why didn't you tell us that
those two girls were wrestlers?

675
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,449
You should've seen the
way they batted me around.

676
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,420
(thug moans)

677
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,670
- You two are a pair of useless fools!

678
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,210
At long last, I find a specimen

679
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,730
that is perfect for our work,

680
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,660
and you botch up the whole job.

681
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,493
Imbeciles!

682
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,480
- I'm absolutely certain

683
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,670
that those men will try to get you again.

684
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,280
Now then, if they do return,

685
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,533
I think it's best to
react in another manner.

686
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,113
That is, if you're interested
in helping the law.

687
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,420
- I think you can talk plainer.

688
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,253
- Look,

689
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,330
in this case, there's not
a scrap of solid evidence

690
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,563
to help us discover that insane murderer.

691
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,740
Alice's fiance came in,
and we questioned him too.

692
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,073
He's completely clean.

693
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,283
Besides, he's broken up about her murder.

694
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,463
It's a shame.

695
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:20,880
We'll have to begin at
the beginning once more,

696
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,340
with nothing.

697
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,190
- How can we help you solve the case?

698
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,080
- If my suspicions are based on fact,

699
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,123
and those men try to kidnap you again,

700
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,400
in that case, I want you
to let yourselves be taken.

701
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,983
Tommy and I will be
following close behind you.

702
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,100
Now, if you do that, the
men will lead us directly

703
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,980
to their hideout and to their boss.

704
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,600
- Maybe your idea will work.

705
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,580
All I need is a little
luck to avenge my sister.

706
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,670
- Now don't you worry, baby doll,

707
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,170
'cause I intend to watch out for you.

708
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,260
- Do you mean it, Tommy?

709
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,910
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,564
- I feel so safe and protected.

711
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:57,295
(body thuds)

712
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:59,172
(Tommy chuckles)

713
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:01,487
(throat clears)

714
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:04,487
(jazzy piano music)

715
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,786
- See you Wednesday night, Johnny.

716
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:18,024
(jazzy orchestral music)

717
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:29,484
(exciting orchestral music)

718
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:38,790
(man whistles)

719
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,030
- Did you hear that whistle?

720
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,920
- Yes.

721
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,663
- I've got a strong feeling
that we're about to be attacked.

722
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,790
Are you afraid?

723
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,111
- No, but I sure would feel a lot happier

724
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:51,373
if I knew that Mike were
out there in the shadows.

725
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,063
- I know why you say it and me too.

726
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:58,101
(Ruby gasps)

727
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,510
- Look there, that light!

728
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,920
- Do you think it's a signal?

729
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,550
- I don't know,

730
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,283
but be prepared just in case.

731
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,600
(jazzy orchestral music)

732
00:37:23,385 --> 00:37:26,802
(jazzy orchestral music)

733
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,450
- X-4 to all cars.

734
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,760
Prepare your sectors to help
us when you get the command.

735
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,603
That is all.

736
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:46,850
(fists thumping)

737
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,919
We'll stop this right now.

738
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:48,752
- No.

739
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:49,800
You're trying to spoil things.

740
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,950
Let's follow their car.

741
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:04,331
(door shuts)

742
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:06,831
(car revving)

743
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:21,806
(car revving)

744
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:24,640
(tires squealing)

745
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,545
- You did an excellent job, Gomar.

746
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:29,100
(buzzer buzzing)

747
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,340
- That's the danger signal!

748
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,240
- You idiots!

749
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,685
You allowed yourself to be followed!.

750
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,435
(buzzer buzzing)

751
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,733
- There are two men, Chief,

752
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,103
and they look like cops.

753
00:39:10,253 --> 00:39:11,960
(gun fires)

754
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,804
- Get your hands up!

755
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:13,637
(gun smacks)

756
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:15,380
(fists punching)

757
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,310
What a right!

758
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,170
Where are the others?

759
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,003
Let's get going!

760
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:20,604
Ghosty!

761
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:21,437
(fist punches)

762
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:23,413
(Tommy groans)

763
00:39:23,413 --> 00:39:24,246
Oh, yeah?

764
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:32,309
(gun fires)

765
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:33,142
(thug groans)

766
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:35,520
(body thuds)

767
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,533
(fist strikes)

768
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,283
(boxes tumbling)

769
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,283
- Are you all right?

770
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,643
Then come on.

771
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,679
(bodies scuffling)

772
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:15,596
(bodies scuffling)

773
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,523
(fist punches)

774
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:26,566
(fist punches)

775
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,806
(fist punches)

776
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:31,490
(fist punches)

777
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,883
- Tommy. Tommy, wake up!

778
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,183
Hold your fire!

779
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,016
It's me.

780
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,231
- You almost got it.

781
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:40,337
(sirens blaring)

782
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:43,343
(tires screeching)

783
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:46,240
- (gasps) So, it's you!

784
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,100
- Stay where you are, everyone!

785
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,933
Grab these men!

786
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,140
- Hold my gun.

787
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,973
- All right.

788
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:53,806
Get going!

789
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,703
- Come on.

790
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,543
After you, Chief.

791
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,583
- Police capture Mad Doctor and his gang.

792
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:16,378
(phone rings)

793
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,233
Hello?

794
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,460
He's interrogating the Mad Doctor.

795
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,610
- You might as well open up

796
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,210
and tell us everything you know.

797
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,600
A complete confession would
do a lot in your favor.

798
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,723
Answer me!

799
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,293
Are there other men in
this gang that got away?

800
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,463
Are these the only men
you had working for you?

801
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,120
Professor Wright,

802
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,950
is there anything that you want to ask?

803
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,170
- No, there isn't.

804
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,700
Oh, yes, just one thing.

805
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,770
It's all so confusing, you know,

806
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,710
but it's strange.

807
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,703
I still can't believe that
Boris is the Mad Doctor.

808
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,113
Don't you think he's playing with us,

809
00:41:58,113 --> 00:42:00,303
covering up for the real Mad Doctor?

810
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,453
- That's possible.

811
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,180
We could give you
complete police protection

812
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,880
if you tell us the truth.

813
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,773
Are you the Mad Doctor, yes or no?

814
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,760
- No!

815
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,593
No!

816
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:16,560
No, another man killed those girls!

817
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,913
- Then where is he?

818
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,833
- He escaped.

819
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,410
When he suddenly realized

820
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,950
that you were just about
to break into the house,

821
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,450
he escaped, taking Gomar with him,

822
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,734
through a secret passageway.

823
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:30,130
- Gomar?

824
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,740
- Yes, the monster

825
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,830
that murdered those four
policemen that night.

826
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,280
And now the doctor will

827
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,230
try to murder me,

828
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,730
because I know too many facts.

829
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,080
I need protection!

830
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,033
Do you hear?

831
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,560
You've got to give me protection!

832
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,960
- Well, all you have to do
is cooperate with the law.

833
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,543
Tell us who the Mad Doctor is!

834
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:01,460
(suspenseful orchestral music)

835
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,476
- The man you're trying to find is...

836
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,643
- There's no danger.

837
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:34,578
Tell us!

838
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,360
Don't you know you're
surrounded by the police?

839
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,550
- The Mad Doctor is...

840
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:41,784
(Boris gasps)

841
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:45,451
(dramatic orchestral music)

842
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,453
- The man's gone.

843
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,030
I suppose that it was his heart.

844
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,130
- Anyone leaving here needs my permission!

845
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,030
The autopsy will tell us
if he died a natural death.

846
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,430
I can't rule out murder.

847
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,070
Someone in here could be the Mad Doctor.

848
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,840
These two small objects here

849
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,953
were responsible for Boris' death.

850
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,890
Inside this cylinder here,

851
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,100
there's a very powerful firing mechanism

852
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:16,080
that fired a tiny little poison needle.

853
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,913
And this morning,

854
00:44:16,913 --> 00:44:19,483
the coroner located that
needle in the man's heart.

855
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,850
The killer had that little
weapon locked in his teeth,

856
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,150
and he had to bite down to fire it.

857
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,590
There's a spring in this.

858
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,233
It's silent and very powerful.

859
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:31,643
- Ah, then the killer lost this cylinder?

860
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,040
- He spit it out in the other room.

861
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,120
Anyone could have done
it without being noticed.

862
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,120
- Inspector, now that we know
where the needle came from,

863
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,010
we can locate exactly
where the killer stood

864
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,800
the instant he fired.

865
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,500
- That's not going to help us.

866
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,610
You see, the needle entered his
body at a fantastic velocity

867
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,080
but it wasn't the blow against the heart

868
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,890
that murdered the individual.

869
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,010
The poison took a second
to get to the brain.

870
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,170
He had sufficient time to turn around,

871
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,000
and that means he was in another position

872
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,150
when the needle struck.

873
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,913
- Are you trying to say

874
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:04,330
that among the person
standing there in that room

875
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,370
at least nine or 10 as I recall,

876
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,350
that you'll find the criminal?

877
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,520
- Exactly.

878
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,070
And I'm sure you're aware that I'm unable

879
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,120
to arrest the whole
group of suspects either.

880
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,610
- The Mad Doctor could be anyone, right?

881
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,500
You, Tommy, or some other detective.

882
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,753
One of those punks too.

883
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,400
Or you, Professor.

884
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,233
- That's right.

885
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:25,067
(The Mad Doctor laughs)

886
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:28,930
- Once again, I made the
police look like fools.

887
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,880
Boris tried to turn me in,

888
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,370
but he paid dearly for his treachery.

889
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,900
Did you kill him, Chief?

890
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,340
- Naturally, I did.

891
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,580
I reward my employees quite well,

892
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,283
as long as they're faithful to me.

893
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,720
On the other hand, the traitors
will pay with their lives.

894
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,063
Don't you forget that for one second.

895
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,150
- Don't you worry about me.

896
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,580
I'm no stool pigeon, Chief.

897
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,853
- No, no, of course you're not.

898
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:59,680
And now you are to go out
and locate three or four men

899
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,390
that I can confide in.

900
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,090
I'll explain why.

901
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,510
We've got to reorganize the group.

902
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,740
Once and for all, I've got
to get rid of that detective

903
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,560
and his stupid sidekick.

904
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,053
He's ruining my plans.

905
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,070
I'm going to make a good trap.

906
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,473
I'm sure his death is
not going to be pretty.

907
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,203
I swear.

908
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,963
And now listen, because there
are things that you are to do.

909
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,463
You will go to a certain house.

910
00:46:32,186 --> 00:46:35,103
(bodies scuffling)

911
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:40,593
(body thuds)

912
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,510
(bodies scuffling)

913
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,969
(bodies scuffling)

914
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:52,279
(body thuds)

915
00:46:54,886 --> 00:46:57,969
(wrestlers clapping)

916
00:46:59,366 --> 00:47:00,250
(Gloria claps)

917
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,700
- Gloria, that girl is
really a tremendous wrestler.

918
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,280
- She's extraordinary.

919
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,330
Bravo, you were great!

920
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,633
- Hey, look who's here!

921
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,713
- Any news?

922
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,803
- Not yet.

923
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,180
- How long will that
madman run around free,

924
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,920
killing other girls?

925
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,910
- Well, I know why you're impatient, but,

926
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,130
but he's going to be caught soon.

927
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,080
Don't worry.

928
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,250
- He sure is.

929
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,850
The Mad Doctor is going to be back soon,

930
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,044
but now we're prepared.

931
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,250
- Yeah, in what way?

932
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,253
- Well, look.

933
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,380
I'd like you to use these watches here.

934
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,710
- Hey, these are cute.

935
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,150
- Well, actually, they were
made to help the police.

936
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:39,983
They're not watches.

937
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,980
They're transmitting and receiving sets.

938
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,030
Now, you're not going
to forget to wear these.

939
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,413
- Yours are just like the
ones that we're wearing.

940
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,030
- They're useful little gadgets.

941
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,210
In case any of you find
yourselves up against it,

942
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,817
you only have to push this button.

943
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:54,650
(watch beeps)

944
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,530
That'll send a signal out.

945
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,890
Right?

946
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,230
Then I'll be able to find you.

947
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,070
- That's marvelous, really.

948
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,100
- You're the marvelous
one, you lovely redhead.

949
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,810
- I'd say the same thing about you,

950
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,370
you five-foot lightning bolt.

951
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,550
- Can the kidding around, you too.

952
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,700
We got lots of work.

953
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,130
- This woman loves me dearly.

954
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:10,963
- See you later.

955
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:11,796
Come on.

956
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:13,586
- Bye.

957
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,470
- Police station.

958
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:32,830
This is very urgent, please.

959
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,080
I'd like to speak to the detective bureau.

960
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,517
(phone rings)

961
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,948
- Detective bureau.

962
00:48:49,948 --> 00:48:52,165
- I'd like to speak to the captain.

963
00:48:52,165 --> 00:48:54,492
This matter is important.

964
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:56,828
- You say you want to talk to the captain?

965
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:57,661
Just a minute.

966
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:58,494
I don't think he's here.

967
00:48:58,494 --> 00:48:59,370
- He came in just a second ago.

968
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,670
- Hold on, he just got in.

969
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,070
Captain, you're wanted on the telephone.

970
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:04,903
- Thank you.

971
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,270
Captain Henderson.

972
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,750
- This is Professor Wright, Captain.

973
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,580
I'm calling you because
my house was attacked

974
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,370
by the men of the Mad Doctor.

975
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,430
- The Mad Doctor, you say?

976
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,780
Are you sure you're all right?

977
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,292
- Yes, captain,

978
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,180
but could you come to
my house immediately?

979
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,360
Do me that favor.

980
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,860
- I'll be directly there, sir.

981
00:49:26,662 --> 00:49:30,079
(tense percussive music)

982
00:49:38,428 --> 00:49:40,640
(doorbell buzzes)

983
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,900
- Captain Henderson.

984
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,733
Come in, come in.

985
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:43,640
Won't you please, sir?

986
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,663
- Stay where you are!

987
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,750
- What is this, Professor?

988
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,380
- You don't know how sorry I am, Captain,

989
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,480
but they forced me to do this.

990
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,150
They threatened to kill me!

991
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,073
- Turn around, get your hands up.

992
00:49:56,945 --> 00:49:58,020
(fists striking)

993
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,890
Grab them!

994
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,323
Let's go.

995
00:50:05,893 --> 00:50:07,130
If you value your life, Professor,

996
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,052
don't move from this spot for 10 minutes.

997
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:09,885
- Yes, sir.

998
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:12,236
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

999
00:50:12,236 --> 00:50:14,455
(door shuts)

1000
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:17,422
(car revs)

1001
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:19,839
(door shuts)

1002
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:40,124
(phone rings)

1003
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,130
- Hello?

1004
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,450
Oh, yes, just a moment.

1005
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,580
She's right here.

1006
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,630
Professor Wright is on the phone, Gloria.

1007
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,550
- How are you, Professor?

1008
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,910
You mean...

1009
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,023
Why, that's terrible!

1010
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,710
He insists that Mike and
Tommy have been kidnapped

1011
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,610
by the men working for the Mad Doctor.

1012
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,440
Okay, we'll be there in 20 minutes.

1013
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,090
- Hey, no, just a minute.

1014
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,300
Aren't you forgetting these?

1015
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,603
- Gosh, you're right.

1016
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,660
Thanks, Professor.

1017
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,360
I'll talk to you about this later.

1018
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,020
No, no, no, don't you do anything.

1019
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,440
So long for now.

1020
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,430
- Look, Gloria, if they find
they're in terrible danger,

1021
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,380
they'll be calling us here.

1022
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,610
Isn't that right?

1023
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,420
So the only thing we can do is wait.

1024
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,526
- Yes, only suppose they kill them

1025
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:30,743
before they can use their radios.

1026
00:51:32,162 --> 00:51:35,829
(dramatic orchestral music)

1027
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,820
- Good evening, gentlemen.

1028
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,703
I hope that my men have not
mistreated you unnecessarily.

1029
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,890
Due to the fact that you are continually

1030
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,170
sticking your noses into my business,

1031
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,583
I have decided to get rid
of you two permanently.

1032
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,353
Once you are no longer in my way,

1033
00:51:59,353 --> 00:52:01,853
it will be simple to
capture the lady wrestlers.

1034
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,463
Take them to the death chamber.

1035
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,157
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1036
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:24,021
(fist thumps)

1037
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:36,184
(door slides)

1038
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,593
- Have a nice trip.

1039
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,940
- Have a nice trip.

1040
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,576
Is this a ship they've thrown us into?

1041
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:47,520
(Gomar growls)

1042
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,103
(Gomar growls)

1043
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:54,654
(wall squeaking)

1044
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,043
What's this?

1045
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,138
(wall squeaking)

1046
00:53:09,138 --> 00:53:09,980
(Gomar growls)

1047
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,880
- Gloria, listen, can you hear me?

1048
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,857
- Come in, come in, Mike!

1049
00:53:14,857 --> 00:53:15,900
- Can you hear?

1050
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,380
Listen, we're in a trap, Gloria!

1051
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,960
- Yes, I can, only where at?

1052
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,900
- I don't know.

1053
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,230
The doctor's men tied our hands,

1054
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,940
and they blindfolded us also.

1055
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,130
Now listen,

1056
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,960
I'm going to turn on a constant sound wave

1057
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,520
that you'll be able to receive.

1058
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,263
If you follow it, you'll find us.

1059
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,270
- You better hurry, honey,

1060
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,000
or we're not going to walk
to the altar together!

1061
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,630
- Don't say such things, small hero.

1062
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,610
I'll be there like white lightning.

1063
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:37,795
- We better hurry!

1064
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:39,523
(signal beeps)

1065
00:53:39,523 --> 00:53:40,990
- I hope they're getting our signal.

1066
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,250
- I think they are.

1067
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,290
Don't worry about it.

1068
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,370
- Don't worry about it!

1069
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,307
There must be a hole around here.

1070
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,729
(wall squeaks)

1071
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:50,979
(car revs)

1072
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,970
- There's gotta be some way out!

1073
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:55,803
- But where?

1074
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:56,636
- We'll find it!

1075
00:53:56,636 --> 00:53:57,470
- The harder we push against this thing,

1076
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,130
the harder it pushes back!

1077
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,210
(signal beeps)

1078
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,730
- Go right straight ahead, Gloria.

1079
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,410
The sound is coming in much
stronger in this direction.

1080
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,380
(signal beeping)

1081
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,336
- Look out!

1082
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:09,169
Don't let him get his hands on you!

1083
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:11,674
- Do you think I need your advice?

1084
00:54:11,674 --> 00:54:12,805
(Gomar growls)

1085
00:54:12,805 --> 00:54:14,520
(Tommy whimpering)

1086
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,515
- Hang on, Tommy!

1087
00:54:15,515 --> 00:54:16,940
(Tommy whimpers)

1088
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,840
Come on!

1089
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,480
(Tommy screams)

1090
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,743
- It's beginning to weaken Gloria.

1091
00:54:20,743 --> 00:54:21,620
(signal beeps)

1092
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,823
You better take the next street.

1093
00:54:22,823 --> 00:54:24,160
(signal beeps)

1094
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,310
Now the waves are coming in.

1095
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,143
- Try not to fall!

1096
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:27,976
You're doing fine!

1097
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:28,818
(Tommy whimpers)

1098
00:54:28,818 --> 00:54:30,030
Hold on!

1099
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,400
- The wave is coming in,

1100
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,244
and it's getting much
stronger in this direction.

1101
00:54:33,244 --> 00:54:34,077
(signal beeps)

1102
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:35,050
(Gomar growls)

1103
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,120
- Hey, not so much noise!

1104
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,410
(Gomar growls)

1105
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,243
- Try to hold on!

1106
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:39,279
It's stopped now!

1107
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:40,770
- Do you think I'm a machine?

1108
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,905
- Try to stiffen your legs!

1109
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:46,200
(signal beeps)

1110
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,630
- But this is impossible.

1111
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,510
This is the same place

1112
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,381
where we captured Boris the other night.

1113
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:51,270
(signal beeps)

1114
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,330
- This is where the
sound is the strongest.

1115
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,232
You can hear it.

1116
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:55,260
(signal beeps)

1117
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,448
- Any ideas?

1118
00:54:56,448 --> 00:54:57,900
(signal beeps)

1119
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,733
- Let's go in.

1120
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:02,882
(signal beeps)

1121
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:09,931
- We're going to need the crowbar, Gloria.

1122
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,514
(signal beeps)

1123
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,210
(crowbar prying)

1124
00:55:24,983 --> 00:55:27,900
(crowbar rattling)

1125
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:31,640
(signal beeps)

1126
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:46,006
(signal beeps)

1127
00:55:46,006 --> 00:55:47,020
- Don't you think it's strange

1128
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,686
that they returned to this house?

1129
00:55:48,686 --> 00:55:49,934
(signal beeps)

1130
00:55:49,934 --> 00:55:50,767
- Listen.

1131
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,490
You don't think Boris has
come back to life, do you?

1132
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:55,790
- Oh, don't talk nonsense.

1133
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,373
(signal beeps)

1134
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,813
(signal beeps)

1135
00:56:16,729 --> 00:56:19,312
(signal beeps)

1136
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,813
(signal beeps)

1137
00:56:35,363 --> 00:56:38,113
(signal beeping)

1138
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,310
- Here we are, boys!

1139
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,460
- Tommy!

1140
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,490
- Gloria!

1141
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:45,540
- Ruby!

1142
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,930
- Tom, where are you?

1143
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,260
Can you hear us calling?

1144
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,470
- Yes!

1145
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:51,120
- Are you close to us?

1146
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,993
- Yes, only behind the iron curtain!

1147
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,039
(Gomar growls)

1148
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,659
(fist strikes)

1149
00:56:58,659 --> 00:56:59,705
(exciting orchestral music)

1150
00:56:59,705 --> 00:57:02,082
(fists punching)

1151
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:05,043
(fist punches)

1152
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:07,747
(bodies scuffling)

1153
00:57:07,747 --> 00:57:11,033
(fist punches)

1154
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:12,416
(boxes crashing)

1155
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,423
(bodies scuffling)

1156
00:57:14,423 --> 00:57:17,847
(fists punching)

1157
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:19,300
(bodies scuffling)

1158
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,324
(fist punches)

1159
00:57:21,324 --> 00:57:24,608
(fists punching)

1160
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,358
(boxes crashing)

1161
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:31,182
(body thuds)

1162
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:34,420
(body crashing)

1163
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,253
- Try to hold on!

1164
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:36,873
They're coming in!

1165
00:57:36,873 --> 00:57:39,241
(fists punching)

1166
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:40,074
[Mike] Gloria, Ruby!

1167
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:41,510
- We can hear you!

1168
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:43,070
How'd they get you in there?

1169
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:43,975
- There's a button on the floor!

1170
00:57:43,975 --> 00:57:45,010
Step on it!

1171
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,045
- It's underneath the lever!

1172
00:57:47,045 --> 00:57:49,628
(Tommy grunts)

1173
00:57:51,449 --> 00:57:54,710
(Gomar growls)

1174
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:55,779
- Help me!

1175
00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:58,112
Help me get him down, girls!

1176
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:04,097
(exciting orchestral music)

1177
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,895
- Let's get out of here!

1178
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:09,570
(Gomar growls)

1179
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,450
- You take care of these guys here!

1180
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,587
- Yes, sir!

1181
00:58:11,587 --> 00:58:12,840
- The Mad Doctor!

1182
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,049
Come on!

1183
00:58:14,049 --> 00:58:17,716
(exciting orchestral music)

1184
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:22,894
(fist punches)

1185
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:28,468
(fist punches)

1186
00:58:31,218 --> 00:58:33,765
(fist punches)

1187
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:35,956
(bodies scuffling)

1188
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:39,122
(fist punches)

1189
00:58:39,122 --> 00:58:42,205
(Mad Doctor screams)

1190
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,572
(bottles breaking)

1191
00:58:47,572 --> 00:58:49,840
(machine exploding)

1192
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,950
- The laboratory is going
to blow up very soon.

1193
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,850
There's nothing we can do for this man.

1194
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:56,201
- I guess this is the end
of the Mad Doctor then.

1195
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:58,750
- It's a shame we couldn't
find out his real identity,

1196
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,428
but he's paid for all these crimes now.

1197
00:59:01,428 --> 00:59:03,190
(fire crackling)

1198
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:06,330
Tommy, this lab's gonna blow sky high!

1199
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,320
- Too bad we can't stick
around for the fireworks!

1200
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,910
Come on, you guys!

1201
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,560
- Come on, move, get going!

1202
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,053
(Gomar growls)

1203
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,753
(fire crackles)

1204
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:24,615
(boxes smashing)

1205
00:59:25,612 --> 00:59:28,195
(Gomar growls)

1206
00:59:36,545 --> 00:59:37,795
- Gomar, hurry!

1207
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,599
Get me out of here!

1208
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:43,349
(fire crackling)

1209
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,233
- Gloria, Ruby!

1210
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,893
- What happened, Dick?

1211
00:59:57,893 --> 00:59:59,690
- Have you girls seen Mary Carmichael?

1212
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:00,523
- No, we haven't.

1213
01:00:00,523 --> 01:00:01,723
What happened to her?

1214
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,610
- I don't know.

1215
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:04,980
But two days ago, she left
her house and didn't return

1216
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,170
and no one knows where she disappeared to.

1217
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,413
- Is it possible?

1218
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:14,280
- Harry, we're coming
to the end of the road,

1219
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,913
a road that you and I
have traveled together.

1220
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,083
I think it's time now that
you learned my true identity.

1221
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,993
Nothing matters to me anymore.

1222
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,710
My only desire is to make that girl pay

1223
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,230
for what she did to me.

1224
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,063
Look!

1225
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,313
- It's you.

1226
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,040
It's not possible.

1227
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,690
- As I said, she didn't return.

1228
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,920
I think something happened to her.

1229
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,970
So I'll telephone the police immediately.

1230
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:45,470
- Gloria, someone wants you on the phone.

1231
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,303
- Oh, thanks.

1232
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,340
Hello?

1233
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,303
This is she.

1234
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,880
Hello, Professor.

1235
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,100
It's nice to hear your voice again.

1236
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,090
- Thank you so much, Gloria.

1237
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,840
Tell me, how are you feeling?

1238
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,370
- Why, I feel fine, sir.

1239
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,390
And you?

1240
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,820
Hard at work the way you always are?

1241
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,760
- Oh, there's nothing to it.

1242
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,330
Gloria, I was thinking

1243
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:12,298
that I'd like to watch your wrestle again.

1244
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:13,930
Tell me, are you contracted

1245
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,760
to wrestle abroad in the near future?

1246
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,760
- No, no, I'll stay here
until at least March.

1247
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,770
Listen, I'll send you
free tickets if you like.

1248
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:25,170
- No, I'm grateful to
you, but don't bother to.

1249
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:28,880
The truth is, that I still
don't know when I can get away.

1250
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,080
But I promise you this,

1251
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,200
I won't wait long,

1252
01:01:32,195 --> 01:01:34,260
and I'll see you very soon, Gloria.

1253
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,310
- So long, Professor.

1254
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,320
- I'll keep that promise
to you, young lady,

1255
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,090
and then...

1256
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:48,470
Vengeance.

1257
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,303
(Gomar growls)

1258
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:50,490
My vengeance!

1259
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,663
And you two are going
to help me carry it out!

1260
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,270
You, Gomar,

1261
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:58,553
you that are part human and half beast,

1262
01:01:58,553 --> 01:02:00,540
that I created you.

1263
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,080
I plan to use your physical strength

1264
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,630
and transplant it into the
body of this woman here.

1265
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,310
She's going to destroy Gloria Venus.

1266
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,837
She'll blow her body to pieces.

1267
01:02:10,837 --> 01:02:12,370
Yes, a little killing in the ring,

1268
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,048
for all the audience to see.

1269
01:02:14,048 --> 01:02:17,048
(Mad Doctor laughs)

1270
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,020
You're going to help with the operation.

1271
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,301
We'll start immediately.

1272
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:23,884
(Gomar growls)

1273
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:35,042
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1274
01:02:58,036 --> 01:03:02,058
(dramatic orchestral music)

1275
01:03:02,058 --> 01:03:03,058
She's alive.

1276
01:03:04,275 --> 01:03:05,275
She's alive!

1277
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,570
She made it!

1278
01:03:16,953 --> 01:03:18,093
Your name is Vendetta.

1279
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:21,142
Vendetta!

1280
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,373
I created you for my own use.

1281
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,353
Do you understand?

1282
01:03:26,353 --> 01:03:27,186
You are to obey me.

1283
01:03:27,186 --> 01:03:28,700
You are to do as I command you.

1284
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,760
You inherited the strength
I had given to Gomar,

1285
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:34,900
but now your new brain

1286
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,880
is only a slave,

1287
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,313
with which I'll make you act.

1288
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:41,690
And now I'll transmit orders to you,

1289
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,763
although I stay at a very great distance.

1290
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,400
You will obey the commands I send.

1291
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,713
You'll not protest.

1292
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,743
You simply cannot.

1293
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,863
Tremble, Gloria Venus.

1294
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,100
Vendetta, who I created for my use,

1295
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,363
is your destruction!

1296
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,953
Get up now.

1297
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,003
Destroy that table there!

1298
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,243
Do as I say!

1299
01:04:18,205 --> 01:04:19,626
(table smashing)

1300
01:04:19,626 --> 01:04:23,027
(Mad Doctor laughs)

1301
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:24,957
Tremble, Gloria Venus!

1302
01:04:24,957 --> 01:04:29,390
Tremble! (laughs)

1303
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:33,040
- She's from Paris, and she uses a mask.

1304
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,220
She hides her identity,

1305
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,040
but her name is Vendetta.

1306
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,560
And through her public relations man,

1307
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,630
she has challenged our present
champion, Gloria Venus.

1308
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,820
It is said that the winner gets 2,400,

1309
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,800
and we would like to predict

1310
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,190
that the crowds will pack the house.

1311
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,620
Do you accept the challenge, Gloria?

1312
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,790
- I have no objections,

1313
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,310
and you can inform all the fans

1314
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,770
that I'll accept a fighter,

1315
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,740
because I like a good challenge.

1316
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,280
I'll do my best to win this one also.

1317
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,633
I know my fans want that.

1318
01:05:02,939 --> 01:05:05,106
- Fellas, here's Vendetta!

1319
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:09,500
- I don't know why it is,

1320
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,333
but when she entered,

1321
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:12,815
I began to get this hideous feeling.

1322
01:05:12,815 --> 01:05:15,880
- Could you say why it is
your face behind that mask?

1323
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,570
- It'll be very difficult
for her to understand you.

1324
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,780
She doesn't speak English, I'm afraid.

1325
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,850
Now here you have the
man who handles Vendetta.

1326
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,560
- Oh, the lengths that people will go

1327
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,820
to attract publicity for
themselves. (chuckles)

1328
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,120
- Ah, Gloria, here's the
girl you'll be fighting.

1329
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,620
- It's a pleasure to know you.

1330
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,400
- Uh, excuse me, please.

1331
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,030
Uh, I think it's time
we signed the contract.

1332
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,430
Now everything is written out

1333
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,320
according to the spoken agreement.

1334
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,270
Miss Vendetta, would you be
kind enough to come over here

1335
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,360
and sign the contract?

1336
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,803
- Vendetta, you are to
go over to the desk.

1337
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,163
Sit down.

1338
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,467
Take the pen and sign your name, Vendetta.

1339
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,540
- Tonight we present

1340
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,350
the greatest wrestling match in history!

1341
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:05,910
Fighting for a $25,000 purse,

1342
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,573
Vendetta versus Gloria Venus.

1343
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:09,870
And in the semi-finals,

1344
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:14,193
the American cyclone, The
Golden Ruby versus The Gazelle.

1345
01:06:14,193 --> 01:06:16,943
(crowd chatters)

1346
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,970
- Be careful tonight.

1347
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:24,803
I don't know why,

1348
01:06:24,803 --> 01:06:26,790
but there's something
I don't like about her.

1349
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:28,882
She has such a sinister look in her eye.

1350
01:06:28,882 --> 01:06:30,730
- (laughs) Don't worry about it.

1351
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:31,960
I know I'll be all right.

1352
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,930
- Okay, but you keep your wits about you

1353
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,130
all through the fight.

1354
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,050
(door knocking)

1355
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:36,883
- You ready?

1356
01:06:36,883 --> 01:06:37,790
- Ready.

1357
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,404
- Good luck.

1358
01:06:39,404 --> 01:06:40,237
- Thanks.

1359
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:52,852
(audience cheering)

1360
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,250
(audience cheering)

1361
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:12,489
(audience cheering)

1362
01:07:17,628 --> 01:07:21,594
(audience applauding)

1363
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:24,594
(audience cheering)

1364
01:07:27,324 --> 01:07:30,491
(audience applauding)

1365
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,647
(crowd whistles)

1366
01:07:33,647 --> 01:07:36,064
(crowd boos)

1367
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:37,804
(crowd whistles)

1368
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,470
(audience whistles)

1369
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:41,887
(body thuds)

1370
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:46,851
(audience whistles)

1371
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:51,501
(audience yelling)

1372
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:56,960
- A purse of $25,000 goes
to the winning wrestler!

1373
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,320
They'll wrestle two falls out of three,

1374
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,170
and the time is unlimited!

1375
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,810
In this corner,

1376
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,840
the champion of our country, Gloria Venus!

1377
01:08:08,604 --> 01:08:11,109
(audience cheers)

1378
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:14,109
(audience applauds)

1379
01:08:17,018 --> 01:08:18,458
And in this corner,

1380
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:20,958
is the mystery girl, Vendetta!

1381
01:08:22,586 --> 01:08:25,029
(crowd boos)

1382
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:26,112
- Boo!
- Boo!

1383
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,852
(crowd booing)

1384
01:08:34,095 --> 01:08:36,512
(bell dings)

1385
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,133
- All right, these are the rules.

1386
01:08:42,133 --> 01:08:43,540
When I separate you, I'll count to 10,

1387
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,428
and 20 on the floor

1388
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:48,511
(audience screaming)

1389
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,117
(whistle blows)

1390
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,880
- Run.

1391
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,630
Get back, get back.

1392
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:02,463
Run faster.

1393
01:09:04,733 --> 01:09:08,262
(crowd shouting)

1394
01:09:08,262 --> 01:09:11,548
(crowd shouting)

1395
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:14,298
(crowd shouting)

1396
01:09:15,346 --> 01:09:16,596
Now attack her.

1397
01:09:18,428 --> 01:09:20,845
(body thuds)

1398
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:26,552
(body thuds)

1399
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:32,013
(body thuds)

1400
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,654
(fist punch)

1401
01:09:40,903 --> 01:09:42,012
- Break!

1402
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:43,179
Break, I said!

1403
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:45,908
- (indistinct)

1404
01:09:45,908 --> 01:09:50,412
Make her suffer, make her suffer.

1405
01:09:50,412 --> 01:09:51,453
Suffer Gloria Venus, suffer.

1406
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,403
- One, two, three, four, five.

1407
01:10:01,714 --> 01:10:03,955
(body thuds)

1408
01:10:03,955 --> 01:10:06,955
(audience applauds)

1409
01:10:10,045 --> 01:10:13,045
(audience applauds)

1410
01:10:17,951 --> 01:10:20,935
(dramatic orchestral music)

1411
01:10:20,935 --> 01:10:23,935
(audience applauds)

1412
01:10:26,278 --> 01:10:28,410
- What are you doing in
this arena, you little rat?

1413
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:29,920
Something is going on!

1414
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,300
Now, is it a trap?

1415
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,200
Tell me and hurry!

1416
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,227
(body thumps)

1417
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:39,060
(bodies thumping)

1418
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:43,156
(bodies thumping)

1419
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,553
Just who is that woman
in the ring, do you hear?

1420
01:10:47,553 --> 01:10:48,386
(Harry groans)

1421
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:49,219
What's happening around here?

1422
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:50,052
Come on now!

1423
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:52,885
(audience cheers)

1424
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:56,140
- No, no! (groans)

1425
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:56,973
I'll talk.

1426
01:10:56,973 --> 01:10:58,410
Vendetta used to wrestle with you all.

1427
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,204
(Harry groans)

1428
01:11:00,204 --> 01:11:01,730
Her name is Carmichael.

1429
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,670
The Mad Doctor gave her
tremendous strength.

1430
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:05,558
He took a gorilla's brain
and transplanted it. (groans)

1431
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:06,580
- Then she wasn't killed?

1432
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,967
- (groans) No!

1433
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:09,700
And Professor Wright (groans)

1434
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,463
is working as her agent! (groans)

1435
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:12,579
- Here, police!

1436
01:11:12,579 --> 01:11:14,095
Over here!

1437
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:17,926
(audience shouting)

1438
01:11:17,926 --> 01:11:19,009
- No, no, no!

1439
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,160
(body thumps)

1440
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,993
(audience cheers)

1441
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:38,172
(feet smacking)

1442
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,780
(body thuds)

1443
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,317
(body thuds)

1444
01:11:54,035 --> 01:11:55,944
(body thuds)

1445
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,203
- Hold her.

1446
01:11:57,203 --> 01:11:58,931
Fight her quick.

1447
01:11:58,931 --> 01:12:02,348
Slowly, very slowly, squeeze down on her.

1448
01:12:04,456 --> 01:12:07,315
(crowd whistles)

1449
01:12:07,315 --> 01:12:09,815
(body thumps)

1450
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,453
(body thumps)

1451
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:19,336
(audience shouts)

1452
01:12:21,218 --> 01:12:23,635
(body slams)

1453
01:12:24,762 --> 01:12:25,595
Something's wrong.

1454
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:27,043
The other girl's going in.

1455
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,452
Get the other girl.

1456
01:12:28,452 --> 01:12:30,682
Attack the other girl now.

1457
01:12:30,682 --> 01:12:33,515
(audience shouts)

1458
01:12:37,839 --> 01:12:39,922
Hurry, kill both of them.

1459
01:12:41,443 --> 01:12:44,276
(bodies thudding)

1460
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,738
(body thuds)

1461
01:12:53,475 --> 01:12:55,892
(body slams)

1462
01:13:04,515 --> 01:13:07,515
(audience shouting)

1463
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,167
(body thuds)

1464
01:13:13,614 --> 01:13:15,619
(sirens blaring)

1465
01:13:15,619 --> 01:13:17,710
(tires screeching)

1466
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:18,679
- That's Professor Wright!

1467
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:19,918
He is the Mad Doctor!

1468
01:13:19,918 --> 01:13:22,030
Now go get him and hurry!

1469
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:25,030
(audience shouting)

1470
01:13:29,815 --> 01:13:32,232
(door shuts)

1471
01:13:35,897 --> 01:13:39,138
(audience shouting)

1472
01:13:39,138 --> 01:13:42,320
(body thuds)

1473
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,153
- Come on!

1474
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:46,659
- What's the matter?

1475
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:48,620
- Tell me, have you
seen a masked man here?

1476
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,453
- No, Captain.

1477
01:13:49,453 --> 01:13:50,340
- I want patrols right away.

1478
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,940
We'll surround this building here.

1479
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:52,773
Come on!

1480
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:04,115
(door shuts)

1481
01:14:05,264 --> 01:14:07,043
- Vendetta, Vendetta.

1482
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,023
- Listen well, I'm talking to you.

1483
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:12,883
Leave the ring.

1484
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:15,003
Come to me.

1485
01:14:15,003 --> 01:14:15,923
I need you.

1486
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,715
Leave the ring.

1487
01:14:18,715 --> 01:14:21,715
(audience shouting)

1488
01:14:24,759 --> 01:14:27,676
(audience yelling)

1489
01:14:29,656 --> 01:14:32,823
Vendetta, get here as fast as you can.

1490
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:37,310
Hurry!

1491
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,800
Do as I tell you!

1492
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,577
We've got to hurry, Vendetta!

1493
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:45,033
(fist thumps)

1494
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,410
(tires squealing)

1495
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:51,160
(sirens blaring)

1496
01:14:57,786 --> 01:15:00,536
(sirens blaring)

1497
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:09,561
(crowd murmuring)

1498
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:10,700
- I went out front, they're not there.

1499
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,063
So that means they must
be around here somewhere.

1500
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:20,380
- Up there on the lattice, sir!

1501
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,830
- I knew they couldn't get far

1502
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:24,150
Have them lend us a
spotlight from the arena.

1503
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:25,900
And you, get this crowd outta here.

1504
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:30,390
(crowd murmuring)

1505
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,903
- Where are they?

1506
01:15:36,903 --> 01:15:38,605
Do you have them cornered?

1507
01:15:38,605 --> 01:15:41,438
(crowd murmuring)

1508
01:15:55,685 --> 01:15:58,518
(crowd murmuring)

1509
01:16:00,506 --> 01:16:01,989
- Here are the spotlights
you wanted, Captain.

1510
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:03,680
- Thank you.

1511
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,380
Turn them toward that water tower.

1512
01:16:07,269 --> 01:16:10,102
(crowd murmuring)

1513
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,680
- Yes, yes, there they are!

1514
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,430
- The problem is how they'll
be made to surrender.

1515
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:18,180
They might decide to stay there.

1516
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,560
- They're not coming down.

1517
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,613
- No, you mustn't go up there!

1518
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:25,365
(crowd murmuring)

1519
01:16:31,557 --> 01:16:34,390
(crowd murmuring)

1520
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:44,934
(crowd murmuring)

1521
01:16:51,562 --> 01:16:54,395
(crowd murmuring)

1522
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,230
Professor Wright!

1523
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:01,340
You'll gain nothing by staying here!

1524
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,539
Turn yourself in!

1525
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:03,523
- No, no!

1526
01:17:04,363 --> 01:17:05,650
I know you're trying to get rid of us.

1527
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:07,390
What you want to do is to kill Vendetta,

1528
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:10,160
but I won't let you destroy my great work.

1529
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,160
My work!

1530
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,449
- Listen, professor--
- No!

1531
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:13,282
(fists thumping)

1532
01:17:13,282 --> 01:17:15,107
Push him off the tower, Vendetta!

1533
01:17:21,189 --> 01:17:23,772
(fist punches)

1534
01:17:26,923 --> 01:17:28,993
(crowd screams)

1535
01:17:28,993 --> 01:17:31,826
(crowd murmuring)

1536
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,009
(woman screams)

1537
01:17:39,009 --> 01:17:40,009
Destroy him!

1538
01:17:43,883 --> 01:17:46,465
[Mad Doctor] Destroy him!

1539
01:17:46,465 --> 01:17:49,298
(crowd murmuring)

1540
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,500
- Vendetta will murder him.

1541
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,333
Shoot!

1542
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:03,234
(fist thumping)

1543
01:18:08,566 --> 01:18:09,665
(gun fires)

1544
01:18:09,665 --> 01:18:11,371
(Vendetta gasps)

1545
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:14,475
(crowd screams)

1546
01:18:14,475 --> 01:18:16,892
(body thuds)

1547
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:19,915
- No, you ruthless dogs!

1548
01:18:19,915 --> 01:18:20,854
You killed Vendetta!

1549
01:18:20,854 --> 01:18:22,869
You have destroyed my creation!

1550
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:25,202
(gun fires)

1551
01:18:26,296 --> 01:18:27,533
(crowd screams)

1552
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:29,558
(body thuds)

1553
01:18:29,558 --> 01:18:32,308
(crowd chatters)

1554
01:18:48,779 --> 01:18:50,870
(light orchestral music)

1555
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,520
- It's all over now, don't worry.

1556
01:18:53,387 --> 01:18:55,270
And your sister's been avenged.

1557
01:18:58,305 --> 01:19:01,972
(sweeping orchestral music)

1558
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:11,777
(upbeat synth music)
