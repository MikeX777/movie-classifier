the arms and head were missing</i>

<i>Later, the right arm was found

8
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,960
How do I look?
Strange?

9
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
Very beautiful.

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,880
You're at marriageable age now,
aren't you?

11
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,960
What do you say, Tamio?

12
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,560
Too young,
but fine feathers make fine birds.

13
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,400
Don't be so rude.

14
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,160
You're so beautiful,
he's shy.

15
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,960
I still remember you
as a little girl.

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
Now you're at university.

17
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,360
Soon you'll be a granny.

18
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,520
Watch out.
You'll soon be an old fart.

19
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,840
Don't be cheeky.

20
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,680
Are you ready?

21
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Okay, change position.

22
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,480
Like this?

23
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,480
Look at the camera.

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,720
Ready to shoot.
Now.

25
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
Won't you get some photos?

26
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,560
Me?
No, thanks.

27
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,280
He may be sarcastic,
but he's a good photographer.

28
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,880
I don't like taking photos.

29
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,280
Watch my hand.

30
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,680
Are you ready?
Now.

31
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
How did the job interview go?

32
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,920
Terrible.
How about you?

33
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
No luck, either.

34
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,360
Is that right?

35
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,240
No one wants art school
graduates.

36
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,680
Maybe not.
But let's keep trying, anyway.

37
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,400
How many interviews to go?

38
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,320
Just one.

39
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,640
And what happens if they
reject you, too?

40
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,160
I'll join the
long-term unemployed.

41
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,200
Look.
That's Shinmachi over that way.

42
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,640
I don't remember much.

43
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,440
It's all changed since
we grew up there.

44
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,400
But one thing's for sure.
That's the town I was born in.

45
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
"Fine feathers make fine birds. "

46
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,520
Don't you dare say that to Mari.

47
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,600
Why not?

48
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Girls are easily hurt.

49
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Is she that thin-skinned?

50
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,240
Silly!
She's your kid sister.

51
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
Let me see.

52
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,640
Tamio.

53
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
Tamio.

54
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,600
Someone to see you.

55
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,840
Great photo.
Did you take it?

56
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes, three years ago.
When I was in Palestine.

57
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,520
Such beautiful eyes.

58
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,600
A lot like your eyes.

59
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,960
What?

60
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,760
You think so?

61
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,000
Her father was a suicide bomber.

62
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,120
He died the day before I took it.

63
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
She looks so strong and powerful.

64
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,760
Yes, but there's also the sadness
of losing a loved one.

65
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,920
But she didn't cry at all.

66
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,680
People don't always cry
when they're sad.

67
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,360
So what can I do for you?

68
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,640
I have something to ask you.

69
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
What do you do
with your negatives?

70
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
We file them away.

71
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,120
Even the old ones?

72
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
They're a photographer's
treasure.

73
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,880
Are you after some?

74
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,880
Yes, from about 20 years ago.

75
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
Taken here?

76
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,280
We dispose of them after
10 years with no orders for prints.

77
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,920
I see.

78
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,640
Sure.
Thanks.

79
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,040
But hang on.

80
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,640
My father kept the ones
he particularly liked.

81
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,080
Want to look through them?

82
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,960
Sure.

83
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,480
They're filed by surname.

84
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,720
Suzuki... Suzuki...

85
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
This one?

86
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
That's not it.

87
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,800
That's a great clock.

88
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,440
Grandpa got it when
he opened the studio.

89
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,920
Not working?

90
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,160
It'd cost more to fix it
than to buy a new one.

91
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,080
But I can't just throw it away.

92
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
This one?

93
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
That's not it.

94
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,560
When I was a boy,
it still worked.

95
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,160
It has such a beautiful chime.

96
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,600
Here's another.

97
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,280
How about this?

98
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,000
Is this it?

99
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,480
Who's the girl?

100
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,840
That's me.

101
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
You lived around here?

102
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,400
When I was 5 my parents
divorced and moved away.

103
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,080
- Here.
- Thanks.

104
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
Thank you.

105
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,600
He always wanted to be
the Japanese Capa.

106
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,480
Don't start.

107
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,320
But his dad died on his feet
of a heart attack.

108
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,080
So he got stuck with the studio.
That was bad luck.

109
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,920
That's enough.

110
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,600
Before that,
he flew all over the world.

111
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
But now he's stuck in a
local photo studio.

112
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,720
I think it's great.

113
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,360
What is?

114
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,160
Working at an old photo studio.

115
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,040
Everyone's got digital
cameras now.

116
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,880
Photo studios are being
replaced by apartments.

117
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,920
They're out of fashion.

118
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,640
But studios are a record of the
local people's precious moments.

119
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,560
I think that's wonderful.

120
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,760
They're just like time capsules,
aren't they?

121
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,560
All the happiness of
the local people.

122
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,960
Did you ever play here
when you were little?

123
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,440
You don't remember?

124
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,120
What's wrong?

125
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,880
No, it's nothing.

126
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,880
Hey, give me a ride.

127
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,520
On the bicycle?

128
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,320
Sure.

129
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,440
Hey.
Take your hands off.

130
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,320
Make like wings.

131
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,960
Close your eyes.

132
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,880
What?

133
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Close your eyes.

134
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,560
That hurt.

135
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,600
Are you okay?

136
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,920
Hey?

137
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,080
I was worried.

138
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,720
- Are you sure?
- It hurt.

139
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,560
Naturally.

140
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,640
That was dangerous.
I got a real shock.

141
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,840
Thank you for the photo.

142
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,080
Come again any time.

143
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
Take care.

144
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,960
See you.

145
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Listen.

146
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

147
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,480
Anything between you
and Tamio?

148
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,280
What do you mean?

149
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,680
I thought maybe you
were in love with him.

150
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,280
What?
With Tamio?

151
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,560
You must be joking.

152
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,040
So you don't love him?

153
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
He's just an old friend.

154
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,360
A friend of my brother
and a good customer, that's all.

155
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,640
Nothing more.

156
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,520
Really?

157
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,880
Sure.

158
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
Are you sure?

159
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm positive.

160
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,960
You're so full of beans.

161
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,240
Beer.

162
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
And green peppers.

163
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,640
Grilled green peppers, please.

164
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,760
You were like a man
reborn today.

165
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,360
How's that?

166
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,480
You behaved differently.

167
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,320
No, I didn't.

168
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,280
You big liar.

169
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,040
I bet you have a sore shoulder
tomorrow.

170
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,080
I'll be fine.

171
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
Beer, please.

172
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,800
For me, too.

173
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,440
What a doll!
Does she live near here?

174
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,400
She's Mari's classmate.

175
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
From art school?

176
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,360
Got a boyfriend?

177
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,200
Someone you love?

178
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
What's that?

179
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,800
Don't be so rude.
Leave them alone.

180
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,160
Don't get too ambitious.
Know your place.

181
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,120
He's right.

182
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,400
But she's really beautiful.

183
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,320
I hope he's alright.

184
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,840
I guess so,
he could walk by himself.

185
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,160
But he lost so much blood.

186
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,560
I was too scared to move.

187
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
That's natural.

188
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,520
As a photographer,
I've seen far worse than that.

189
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,640
Blood doesn't scare me
any more.

190
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,720
When you see so much death
around you,

191
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,120
it's as if your heart is
like a bomb.

192
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,240
Laws and morals
lose all their meaning.

193
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,120
Death no longer scares you.

194
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,120
It becomes the only way to
keep your dignity as a human.

195
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,000
It's like being dead,
even when you're alive.

196
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,320
Will you go back to Palestine?

197
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
Not any more.

198
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,160
I thought you would.

199
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
You keep that picture
of the girl on your wall.

200
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
I won't go back.

201
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,760
Why not?

202
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,960
Just being there made me
way too callous.

203
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,120
I'd take pictures of people
dying before my eyes.

204
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm too scared of
losing all emotion.

205
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
I'm burned out as a
news cameraman.

206
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,200
I can't get the shots.

207
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,840
But photographs express someone s
joy or grief to others, don't they?

208
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,000
And I really sensed her grief
from your photograph.

209
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,880
Because you took that picture,

210
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,600
I was able to share that
little girl's grief.

211
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,840
You're just being nice.

212
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,240
No, I mean it.

213
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,800
I wonder what Nike looked like.

214
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,800
That's the point.

215
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,960
What was her face like and
what was she looking at.

216
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,000
I like not knowing.

217
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,160
You're forced to use your
imagination.

218
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,640
Doesn't that make it
truly wonderful?

219
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,960
Once I tried to draw her face in
one of my classes.

220
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,920
No matter how hard I tried,
I didn't like any of them.

221
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,920
I have no happy memories
of my family.

222
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,440
Father used to beat Mother
when he was drunk.

223
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
Once he lost control,
there was no stopping him.

224
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,520
Mom was always
battered and bruised.

225
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,920
One of my relatives told me.

226
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,840
But, when I first met you,

227
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,920
I couldn't get you out of
my mind.

228
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,120
Now I know why.

229
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,160
It's because we're the same
kind of person.

230
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,520
<i>Private Party</i>

231
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
When's the baby due?

232
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,640
What are you on about?

233
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
They're having a baby.

234
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,560
You did it, handsome.

235
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,040
When's it due?

236
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,960
Next January.

237
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Less than 9 months?

238
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
When it comes to love,
he's a fast mover.

239
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
Let's get drunk.

240
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:49,640
<i>Congratulations
to the happy couple</i>

241
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,680
<i>May they live long</i>

242
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:01,680
<i>Until they're both
old and gray</i>

243
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,600
Good morning.

244
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,680
I was dreaming.

245
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,160
What about?

246
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,680
There was this little girl.
A tiny little girl.

247
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,920
She was looking at the sea.

248
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,600
She spread her arms as the
sea breeze blew on her.

249
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,640
Where was it?

250
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,560
No idea.
But it was very beautiful.

251
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,360
Maybe it was our little girl?

252
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,360
I guess it was.

253
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,680
Then let's have a baby girl.

254
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,800
Let's take her photo every day.

255
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,200
Good idea.
Let's do that.

256
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,680
No need to memorize
everything at once.

257
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,840
Thank you.

258
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,400
Look, right now
your first priority is the baby.

259
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,160
I know.
I'm being very careful.

260
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,440
Three months is the most
dangerous time.

261
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,280
You must be very careful.
Especially with your first.

262
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Aren't you due at the hospital?

263
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,080
Hospital?

264
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,520
Right.
I'd better hurry.

265
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,600
Now you take care.

266
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
Mom.

267
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,080
Did you think I was your Mom?

268
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,760
No need to worry.
We'll find her.

269
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,240
Hello?
Is this child's mother about?

270
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,440
Are you there?

271
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,240
I'm sorry.
Thank you so much.

272
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,440
Say thank you.

273
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,000
Thank you.

274
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,200
That was very kind of you.

275
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,320
Delivery for you.

276
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,880
Yes?

277
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,880
The neighbors all envy me.

278
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,840
How come?

279
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,600
I'm lucky to have such a
dear daughter-in-law.

280
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,080
Is that right?

281
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,760
If only your father
were still alive.

282
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,040
He'd love to see his
first grandchild.

283
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,840
This is your wife's watch?

284
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
According to the autopsy,

285
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,840
she was strangled to death.

286
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,080
What did he have to say?

287
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Apparently, he'd never
set eyes on her before.

288
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,960
Then why did he
have to kill her?

289
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,880
I'm afraid that will take
some time to resolve.

290
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,600
You mean through a trial?

291
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,520
Yes, but a closed trial.

292
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,800
What do you mean?

293
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,680
All criminals under
the age of 20,

294
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,160
are tried in a closed,
juvenile court.

295
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
What?

296
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,040
The entire proceedings
are carried out in secrecy.

297
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,720
Match them up
and run them through here.

298
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,000
Turn off the light.

299
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,000
This red button next to it,
turn it on.

300
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,600
Then switch this on.

301
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,160
And it comes out here.

302
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,720
Can you tell us something
about the victim?

303
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Any comments about Ayako?

304
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,360
Anything at all.
Please.

305
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,360
You have to eat,
or you'll get ill.

306
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,240
It's the best I can do,
but try it.

307
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,520
Thank you.

308
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,720
I never knew Ayako was
taking pictures.

309
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,960
May I?

310
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,320
I wonder what that was?

311
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,400
<i>Closed</i>

312
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:15,040
Why are the victim's relatives
excluded from the process?

313
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,120
With an adult,
the courts are designed to punish.

314
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,360
But with juveniles,
the aim is to rehabilitate.

315
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,040
And he is to be tried
in juvenile court.

316
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,480
I'm not interested in
his rehabilitation.

317
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,160
Why is he so protected?

318
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,520
We're the victims, not him!

319
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,240
Of course.
But it's different for juveniles.

320
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,680
Who cares about
who or what he is?

321
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,680
We want to know
why he did it.

322
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,800
I have to know.

323
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,360
You can get to see
the transcript.

324
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,360
This is ridiculous.

325
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,760
Did you plan to kill her?

326
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,680
No, not at all.
I never wanted to kill her.

327
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,640
Then why did you
choke her to death?

328
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,920
She resisted,
I wanted to stop her screaming.

329
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,720
Before I realized it,
I was choking her.

330
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,520
What did you think
when she stopped moving?

331
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,920
I never imagined she was dead.

332
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,400
I'll change the question.

333
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,920
Your mother abandoned you
when you were ten?

334
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Yes, she ran off
leaving Father and me behind.

335
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,880
How did you feel then?

336
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,840
I was disappointed
and very angry.

337
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,400
Why did she have to leave me?

338
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,200
How do you feel about the
victim and her family?

339
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,840
I feel sorry for them.

340
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,600
What will you do after you
return to society?

341
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,880
I'll work at my father's business
and work towards something.

342
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,680
That's all I have.

343
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,080
Did you know the victim
was pregnant?

344
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,600
No, I didn't.

345
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,880
<i>- Did you know she was pregnant?
- No, I didn't.</i>

346
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,040
A pack of lies.

347
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,880
What the fuck?

348
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,440
Cut it out.
He's sorry.

349
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,360
Thank you.

350
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,000
- See you.
- Come again.

351
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,520
I cut up all her father's photos
when I got divorced.

352
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,560
So Ayako didn't know
what he looked like.

353
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,560
But now I regret not leaving
any pictures of him.

354
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,080
A hopeless man,
but her father, after all.

355
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,760
She should've known what
he looked like.

356
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,400
She did.

357
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,560
She found the negative for
this photo at my studio.

358
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,000
She asked me to print
another copy.

359
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,400
I thought she wanted a childhood
shot of herself.

360
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,880
But that wasn't the case.

361
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,520
So she did see him?

362
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,920
I just can't do it.

363
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,400
Remember the three of us
used to skip stones?

364
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,680
You were both so
good at it.

365
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,040
Tamio, why don't you
re-open the studio?

366
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,880
I can help out,
like before.

367
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,320
Ayako would be sad
to see you like this.

368
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,720
She'd be much happier if
you were yourself again.

369
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,760
Cherish her memories,
then you won't be lonely.

370
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,120
I envy her.

371
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,520
You still love her deeply,
even when she's gone.

372
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,680
Let me try.

373
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,320
Wow, that's great.

374
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,400
I'll try again.

375
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,440
Alright, get ready.

376
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,320
Be perfectly still.

377
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,760
Look here.

378
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,840
A big smile.

379
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,600
Fix her Kimono.

380
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,440
Smile.

381
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,520
Turn to the right, please.

382
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,280
The right?

383
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,880
That's too far.

384
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,200
Like this?

385
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,480
Hey, look over here!

386
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,400
Good boy.

387
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,680
Excuse me,
you're Murase, aren't you?

388
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,440
Mr. Tamio Murase?

389
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm Ihara,
a magazine reporter.

390
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,080
It's about your wife's case.

391
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,720
This is the criminal who
killed her.

392
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,200
They called him Boy A,
his name is Tatsuya Yamagishi.

393
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,720
He lived in the next town.

394
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,600
His father owns
Yamagishi Motors.

395
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,840
Expensive, imported cars.

396
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,920
Even though he murdered her,

397
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,160
he still doesn't acknowledge it.

398
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,880
According to the police report,

399
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,960
his first words were
"When can I go home?"

400
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,240
He was a dropout,
but he will matriculate.

401
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,320
He'll take college
entrance exams next year.

402
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,920
He's a murderer who will not
admit to his crime.

403
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,760
He'll be released very soon.

404
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,880
An adult would get
the death penalty.

405
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,040
I can't allow that.

406
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,040
I intend to write about him.

407
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,880
I need you to tell me
how you feel

408
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,160
about your murdered wife
and your unborn child.

409
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,440
How dare you.
Leave me alone.

410
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,200
Get lost.

411
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,400
I'm compiling a story
about this boy, Yamagishi.

412
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,120
I want an interview,
if possible.

413
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,280
Go get lost.

414
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,960
Leave me alone.

415
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,520
Stop it.
That's enough.

416
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,440
If you change your mind,

417
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,520
call me here.

418
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,240
Not bad at all,
for you.

419
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,480
Have some, Aunty.

420
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,960
Please.

421
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,280
My husband loved these pickles.

422
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,920
- Did he?
- He did.

423
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,360
Not too green?

424
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,200
No, I like them crunchy.

425
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,640
He also preferred them like this.

426
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,960
I wish he could share
Mari's pickles with us.

427
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,320
Listen, Tamio.

428
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,680
Forget about Ayako.

429
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,640
Find someone and be happy.

430
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,440
I can't do that.

431
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,440
It's been a year now.

432
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,520
Only a year.

433
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,800
No qualms.

434
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,080
After all,
a man needs a woman.

435
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,600
How dare you say that?

436
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,480
Ayako was stolen from me.

437
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,480
How can I ever forget?

438
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,360
If there is someone else,
tell me.

439
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,560
Of course there's no one.

440
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,440
I talked to her,

441
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,400
then we agreed to ask you first.

442
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,200
That's ridiculous.

443
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,320
Tamio has no
special feelings for me.

444
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,320
If he agreed,
would you marry him?

445
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,920
Answer me.

446
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,160
You would, right?

447
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,840
You can't stay single forever.

448
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,600
I'm her brother,
I know it's strange,

449
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,440
but she would make
a good wife.

450
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,400
It's rare for him to get
this drunk.

451
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:31,280
He reckons that you'd make
a good wife for me.

452
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,640
He's a great guy, but...

453
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,320
He's a big mouthed drunk.

454
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,080
He reckons I'm insensitive
not to notice

455
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,360
you've loved me since
we were kids.

456
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,600
I had to laugh.

457
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,760
He's so stupid.

458
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,840
Exactly, he's stupid,
and you're insensitive.

459
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,480
If I can make it skip 3 times,

460
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,160
take me out
on our next day off.

461
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,840
I blew it...

462
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,240
Let's go out anyway.

463
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,400
What is it?

464
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,920
Nothing.

465
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,960
I won't have the baby.

466
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,240
How come?

467
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,960
Because...

468
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
Wait a minute.

469
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,440
Do I mean nothing to you?

470
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,640
I'll never be happy
with any man.

471
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,040
It's not just your decision.

472
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,760
It concerns us both.

473
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,640
Explain yourself.

474
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,200
Come back.

475
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,280
All families
soon break up.

476
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,200
- That's not true.
- You don't understand.

477
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,880
You were brought up in
a happy family.

478
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,040
I have no confidence.

479
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,480
I never even knew my father.

480
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,840
Lots of people don't,
but they still lead happy lives.

481
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,520
How can I be happy?
I've never known happiness.

482
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,440
You said it was better
not knowing.

483
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,040
Just wait.

484
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,920
You said I have to
find what's important.

485
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,880
We can work this out.

486
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,200
We'll be together.

487
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,400
That's what I want.

488
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,160
What do you want now?

489
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,960
My investigation found out he
had a deprived childhood.

490
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,280
Abandoned by his mother.

491
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,920
A brutal, violent father.

492
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:54,080
Perhaps he saw your wife
as a mother image.

493
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,400
So he kills her?
Give me a break.

494
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,800
Of course not.

495
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,320
Leave me alone.

496
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,000
I don't need this.

497
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,640
He's been released,
you know.

498
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,080
He served his time,
so they let him go.

499
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,880
He killed your wife and child.

500
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,240
Don't you think it's too soon?

501
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,160
He hasn't once expressed
any regret for doing it.

502
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,320
I'm concerned
he might do it again.

503
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,960
I've heard enough.

504
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:31,800
Get lost.

505
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,320
Just leave now.

506
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,800
I'll be back.

507
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,480
Don't bother.

508
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,560
May I help you?

509
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,880
Take a look around.

510
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,480
I'll come back later.

511
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,720
What's that for?

512
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,280
Nothing.

513
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,640
You're not planning
anything foolish?

514
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,000
Answer me.

515
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:11,680
I just can't let it go.
Her killer got out, he's living the good life.

516
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,960
I can't forgive him.

517
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,960
He deserves to die,
or worse.

518
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,040
Even if that happened,
nothing would change.

519
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,920
An eye for an eye,
that's the only way.

520
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,080
So you plan to take revenge?

521
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,040
Her soul can't rest until I do.

522
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,040
But that's exactly what he did.

523
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:52,720
Kill him and his family will
suffer like you have.

524
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,200
He stole her future.

525
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,040
But you have no right to
take his.

526
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,000
Don't be so stupid.

527
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,120
You just don't understand,
do you?

528
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,040
No, you don't understand.

529
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,920
Do you know what Ayako
would say?

530
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,280
Of course I do.

531
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,640
Perfectly well.

532
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,720
No, you don't!

533
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,120
You don't know her feelings,
nor mine.

534
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,160
Be more constructive.

535
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,480
Forget about revenge.

536
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,800
Promise me you will.

537
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,040
Please.

538
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,880
Okay.

539
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,000
I promise.

540
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,320
You mean it?

541
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,040
Looking for a car?

542
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,200
I'll leave it to you.

543
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,920
What's the mileage?

544
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,400
I'll check it out.

545
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,560
Just over 30,000km.

546
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,160
Where's your toilet?

547
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,520
That door there.

548
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:48,640
It's an old model, but low mileage.
It's a good buy.

549
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,200
Want a test drive?

550
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,040
No, maybe next time.

551
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,560
<i>Ayako's Landscapes</i>

552
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,360
<i>Ayako's Wind</i>

553
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,560
Every single shot
has an element of wind.

554
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,600
She always shot the wind.

555
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,000
My hometown, by the sea.
A tiny little town.

556
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,240
I had her in the hospital there.

557
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,240
It was cold and stormy night.

558
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:52,160
There was a big fire that night.

559
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,880
I heard the sirens all night long.

560
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:00,200
At the long, stormy night
she was born.

561
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,240
The town is known
for the wind.

562
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,800
She knew the place?

563
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:12,880
Yes, we used to go back there
once a year.

564
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:19,400
Then my father went bankrupt,
he just disappeared.

565
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,920
I haven't been back for
over 20 years.

566
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,720
I wonder what she
thought of me.

567
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,960
I've struggled alone to
make a living.

568
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,880
I was sometimes
cold to her.

569
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,200
She never said anything.

570
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,360
Once, when I broke up
with a man,

571
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:58,240
she pushed herself up against me
while I was crying.

572
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:04,400
She started crying with me.
I was so glad that she did.

573
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,440
She had a very kind heart.

574
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,840
But the poor girl...

575
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,480
...she was so lonely.

576
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,840
I was surprised when she
said she was getting married.

577
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,920
She was afraid of men.

578
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,480
I never thought she'd marry.

579
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,000
Thank you, Tamio.

580
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,720
Her time was short,
but she had you.

581
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,040
That made her very happy.

582
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,400
Forget about her murder.

583
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,000
You have Mari now...

584
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,440
...concentrate on her.

585
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,280
I'm sure that's what
Ayako would want.

586
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,680
She was like that.

587
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,240
I remember her well.

588
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,280
We called her Aya-chan.

589
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:13,320
Her mother was beautiful,
and she was very pretty, too.

590
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:21,600
She was always out back,
looking at the sea.

591
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,040
I warned her it was dangerous.

592
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:31,080
But she'd just laugh
and stay there until it got dark.

593
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,600
We found it here.
Ayako's wind.

594
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,440
Yes, I'm free, why?

595
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,680
Just come tomorrow night.

596
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,080
All the local guys will be there,
It rarely happens.

597
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,160
Yeah, sure.

598
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,040
Mari, you come, too.

599
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:58,960
Me, too?

600
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,720
Yes, be sure to come.

601
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,600
Okay.

602
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,920
You think it'll work?

603
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,440
I'm sure it will be fine.

604
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,840
Don't worry.
He's good at such things.

605
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,920
It will all work out.

606
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,560
After all,
they do love each other.

607
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,520
Really?

608
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:24,680
But don't let on
to Tamio and Mari.

609
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,200
I won t.

610
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,120
We take photos for
the real estate agency.

611
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,480
Do we have to?

612
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:45,200
Sure, we need to find
new avenues of business.

613
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,640
There's no money in it.

614
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,880
If we do a good job,
it'll be steady work.

615
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,080
It's not as if we're busy.

616
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,120
Let's do it.

617
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,280
Watch out!

618
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,160
Here.

619
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,280
Thanks.
A fine looking gentleman.

620
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,560
Yes, he passed away last year.

621
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,040
Really?

622
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,440
He wanted that for
his funeral.

623
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,560
He did it for his family,
before he died.

624
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,640
Did your father take it?

625
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,320
He used to say
the photographer was in every picture.

626
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,280
What does it mean?

627
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,240
His feelings reflect
on every picture he takes.

628
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,520
Like a mirror,
he said.

629
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,120
Not in body,
but in spirit, he meant?

630
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,000
Sit over there.

631
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,120
Why?

632
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,280
I'll take your photo.

633
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,480
What's the occasion?

634
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,280
Our wedding photo.

635
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,560
With this hair?

636
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,880
I like it that way.

637
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,400
But...

638
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,240
You look great.

639
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,560
It'll make a great picture.

640
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,920
Here we go.

641
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,040
Can I take a look inside?

642
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,200
Sure.

643
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,080
Does the navigation system work?

644
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,120
It just needs the key.

645
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,880
Just give me a minute.

646
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,920
There you are.

647
01:29:58,720 --> 01:29:59,760
Hey.

648
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,760
What is it now?

649
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,200
It's not working.

650
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,400
No problem.

651
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,920
Is this the place?
