1
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:04,375
SCARECROW

2
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,667
- Hey! Is she there?
- Yes.

3
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,292
It's freezing!

4
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,875
Let's go!

5
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,583
How are things going?

6
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,958
Badly.

7
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,917
Here he is.

8
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,917
The bastard.

9
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:22,292
I was hoping you'd come.
Let's have a word.

10
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,917
Keep an eye on him.

11
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,333
Things are not so good.

12
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,958
You are our only hope.

13
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:37,583
He's a relative of the Artemyev family.
From Berezovaya Street.

14
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,792
Got out of the woods an hour ago.

15
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,792
He was packing his rifle

16
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:47,125
and accidentally shot her
in the stomach.

17
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,375
It's not my business.

18
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,500
Please help, nobody else can.

19
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,042
No, I can't.

20
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:01,042
If this woman dies,
inspectors will come.

21
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,792
They will turn the village upside down.

22
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,792
Our doctor is green as grass.

23
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,375
She can't do anything.
She wants to send her to the city.

24
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,375
I can't...

25
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,542
I can't drive her to the city,
she's dying.

26
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,542
What do I do if she dies?

27
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,042
Two kids will be left with this jerk.

28
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,625
I'm asking you one last time.

29
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,375
Please.

30
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,667
We need to take her to the city.

31
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,708
Okay. Leave us alone.

32
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,458
- You too.
- Ok.

33
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,500
She'll be all-right.

34
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,875
Never call me here again.

35
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,750
Take this.

36
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,750
Buy some food.

37
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,625
Don't you buy vodka.

38
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,667
Any news?

39
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,292
No.

40
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,958
What then?

41
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,458
We should search in the city.

42
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,542
I've asked a friend, a detective.

43
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,917
He's on it now, he'll update.

44
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,542
Is he good?

45
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:45,583
Yes, he is.

46
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,708
Listen,

47
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,833
just don't buy vodka.

48
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,042
It's 203 rubles.

49
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,417
Look at her.

50
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,208
- What's for you?
- One bread.

51
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,875
- Bread, I said.
- We've run out of bread.

52
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,917
How's that?

53
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:55,167
- No bread left.
- It's right here.

54
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,208
- But it's here.
- No bread left.

55
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,667
- No bread left, haven't you heard?
- Get out of here!

56
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,125
- Yes, there is.
- No! There isn't!

57
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,542
Are you dumb or what? Get lost!

58
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,292
- Screw you!
- What!?

59
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,833
Relax!

60
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,500
- Get up, you!
- Don't come here again!

61
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,042
Get lost!

62
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,208
- Let's go in.
- Don't you ever come here again.

63
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,292
Hello!

64
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,167
We're past 40 already

65
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,917
we've always wanted kids.

66
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,417
His tool is out of order.

67
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,667
It needs to be fixed.

68
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,875
We've tried everything,
ointments, herbs.

69
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:41,958
Even consulted a doctor in the city.
Nothing works.

70
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,750
- Drop your pants.
- What?

71
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,083
- Drop them.
- Do it, Volodya!

72
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,625
Boxers too.

73
00:14:56,792 --> 00:15:00,083
- What?
- Drop your boxers!

74
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,958
Remove your hand.

75
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,083
- Remove your hand.
- Move it!

76
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,000
We don't trust healers that much.

77
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,833
But we've heard a lot about you.

78
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:27,000
They say you really help.
That's why we're here.

79
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,583
- Go have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.

80
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:36,625
- Go to the toilet, then.
- I don't need to yet.

81
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,417
Just go, Lyuba!

82
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,375
Get lost, Lyuba.

83
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,292
What do you want?

84
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,833
Please, help.

85
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,417
I told you not to come.

86
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,333
I'll give you everything I have.

87
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,667
It's not possible.

88
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,833
I beg you!
You're the only one who can help.

89
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,000
No, no.

90
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,208
I know you can.

91
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,875
- Get away from here!
- No, I won't.

92
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,708
I told you before, forget it!

93
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,458
Enough, go away!

94
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,542
I said, go!

95
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,708
Hello!

96
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,417
Have a look at our grandma.

97
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:27,000
Go away! Don't touch me!

98
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,458
What are you doing?!

99
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:46,167
Do you want to mother a puppy?

100
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,708
You don't believe me?

101
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:55,208
You don't.
But I can make it happen.

102
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,792
Let me go! Let me go!

103
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:06,583
- You'll give birth to a puppy!
- Get off of me!

104
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,125
Let's go out.

105
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,458
Hey, you!
What were you doing there?

106
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,708
- Did she just come out of there?
- Yes.

107
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:27,083
Tell the owner.
She could've stolen something.

108
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,000
Hello!

109
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,542
Please come here!

110
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:57,042
- Is it a good kyrympa?
- Yes, it is.

111
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:59,375
- Are you a good player?
- Yes, I am.

112
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,667
- Can you play?
- Nope.

113
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,250
- Wanna try?
- Me?

114
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,833
- Want me to play?
- Yes.

115
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,625
- Your kyrympa?
- Yes.

116
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,792
- Like this?
- Yes.

117
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,542
Stay away from my son!
Let's go!

118
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,583
Phooey on you, bitch!

119
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,542
I see you've run out of firewood.

120
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,542
Me and my son,
we brought you some.

121
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:12,708
He's been stuttering lately,
can you have a look?

122
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,875
He never stuttered before.

123
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,208
Maybe, he was bullied at school.

124
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,750
Or it might be an age issue.

125
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,333
Cant' figure it out.

126
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:30,292
Ilya, tell the lady about our trip.

127
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,833
Went to the woods this morning.

128
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:39,250
Brought some for us and for you.

129
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,792
That's it.
It can be worse, though.

130
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:00,167
Tell the lady about your school,

131
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,750
about your friends.

132
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:06,583
Petya goes to another school.

133
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,375
But I play with him.

134
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,042
There's also Filip, but he's sick.

135
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,875
Get out.

136
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,708
Get out!

137
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:44,167
Are you going to do anything?
Aren't you a district police officer?

138
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,667
I've been telling you since spring!

139
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,958
Find the owners and penalize them!

140
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,833
Unattended dogs should be muzzled!

141
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:59,542
Otherwise, they should be chained!

142
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,833
It's outrageous!
They nearly bit me!

143
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:07,250
If you do nothing,
I'll file a complaint to the ministry!

144
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,042
The minister is my classmate!

145
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,875
Let's not drop names, Lyudmila.

146
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,958
Isn't it your own fault?

147
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,125
How is it my fault?!

148
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,417
I've seen you vexing
these dogs repeatedly!

149
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:25,375
Do I look that stupid?!

150
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:31,625
Found the one to blame,
haven't you?

151
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,875
- Everybody has seen that.
- I'll report on you!

152
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,792
You were poking the Mikhailov's
dog with a stick!

153
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:45,250
What were you doing there?
Spying on me?!

154
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:50,042
We were shutting down black market
shops that you'd been reporting!

155
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,042
I started complaining 3 years ago!

156
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:58,583
Those bootleggers moved to the city.
Made high living out of vodka.

157
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,208
Did you even know that?

158
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,875
Talking about dogs, look who's here.

159
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,833
Shoo from here.

160
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:10,208
Are you shooing me?

161
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,667
- Seriously?!
- I said shoo.

162
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:17,333
See, officer, she's shooing me
like I'm a dog!

163
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,542
- I demand some respect!
- Calm down, Lyudmila.

164
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:23,792
I promise,
I'll take care of the dogs.

165
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:28,542
I'll go buy some poison and take
care of them myself!

166
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,667
Whatever!
I'm fed up with you!

167
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:34,083
You see, it's like this every day!

168
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,917
She's provoking the dogs herself.

169
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:40,167
I would go off on her, too!

170
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,625
Anything new?

171
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,875
- About what?
- You know.

172
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,917
No, not yet.

173
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,083
- Still searching.
- You've been searching for a while.

174
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:57,375
Don't get me wrong,
I only have two hands.

175
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,375
I don't even know whom to ask.

176
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,208
I think we should search
somewhere else.

177
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:09,125
You're pretty fast when you need me.

178
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,625
Don't worry, we'll find a clue.

179
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:17,833
I think we should look in the city.

180
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:22,375
Of course. If she still was here my
colleagues would have found her already.

181
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:27,208
-What if you don't find her in the city?
-I'm sure she's there.

182
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,625
It's easy to hide in a big city.

183
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,000
- Can you play kyrympa?
- Kyrympa?

184
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:43,167
I only tried in school.

185
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:46,375
But now I can't.
What about you?

186
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,042
Shut your barn door.

187
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,708
Them again.

188
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:19,417
Gee, there are all sorts of parasites.

189
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:22,083
Salmonellosis.
Must be some parasite.

190
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:26,167
You eat a lot of raw liver,
what if our baby'll get worms?

191
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:30,125
- But I've eaten it only once.
- Anyway.

192
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:34,000
You eat raw liver everyday,
and you don't have worms.

193
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:39,083
Talking about liver:
what if we sell our meat leftovers?

194
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,708
Definitely no.
We're sending them to mom.

195
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,375
We'll send some to mom,
and sell some too.

196
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:49,833
- Hey, you! We're in line here!
- Stop!

197
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,833
Let her go.

198
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,417
- I can't stand her!
- Why not?

199
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:01,167
- She is a fake healer!
- How do you know she's fake?

200
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:07,125
She cons people
so she can buy vodka.

201
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:10,125
Haven't you seen her drunk in the street?

202
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,333
- What if she's real?
- No way!

203
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:18,500
- She's a liar. L-I-A-R.
- And you are an expert.

204
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,833
I just know. She is always drunk.

205
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,792
Haven't you noticed? Just look at her.

206
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,958
Stop it.

207
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,167
Hurry up.

208
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:50,292
Keep it dry. Come next Tuesday,
I'll remove the stitches.

209
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:52,500
I can remove them myself.

210
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,083
Why can't you...

211
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:58,708
Heal myself?

212
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,792
I doesn't work like that.

213
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:12,333
-How's that woman doing?
-I don't know, she was taken away.

214
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,583
Look at that self-proclaimed doctor!

215
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:40,667
- Go heal yourself!
-Mind your own wife, the baby's not yours.

216
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,583
- What is she saying, Stepan?
- What?

217
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,458
Hey, you! What did you just say?

218
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,875
Stop talking bullshit!

219
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,833
- Come here!
- Stepan!

220
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,917
Stepan! What are you doing? Stop!

221
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:07,333
Stepan!

222
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,042
Stepan! Stop! Enough!

223
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:20,875
He's mutilated you.

224
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:25,625
Want me to lock him up
for a couple of weeks?

225
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,667
No.

226
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:33,708
Or I can ask my guys to give him
a beating?

227
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:37,083
No, no.

228
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:50,208
Here, my city friends got something.

229
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:52,708
We have the address.

230
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,958
You'd better throw it away.

231
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,208
Just burn it and forget it.

232
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:26,125
Well, it's up to you.

233
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:12,625
- Got a sauna whisk?
- What?

234
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:16,917
- I want to have a wash.
- Sure.

235
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,708
Klava is about to deliver.

236
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,833
Breathe, Klava, breathe!

237
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:16,375
Push! Push!

238
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:21,000
Breathe! In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

239
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,250
Just keep breathing.

240
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,167
Now push! Push!

241
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,833
Here's water.

242
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,958
Relax.
Try to relax and breathe.

243
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:48,125
-Stepan!
-Get out! All of you.

244
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:58,708
Come on. Don't hurt your baby.

245
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:03,708
Breathe. It's close.

246
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,375
It's almost here.

247
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,125
It's almost over.

248
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:28,042
Calm down, be a good mum.

249
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:33,167
It's coming out!
Come here, come here!

250
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,750
Almost here.

251
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:37,458
- I've seen you have a kyrympa.
- Yes.

252
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,625
- Can I borrow it?
- Yes.

253
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:10,708
Fool.

254
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,250
- Good day! There is a vacant seat.
- Hello! Snuggle up here.

255
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,792
- Why are you heading to the city?
- Doctor's check-up.

256
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:34,875
- And you?
- To help my son with the dorm.

257
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:40,875
- How is your slaughter season?
- Done with the cow, now on to the horse.

258
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:42,792
You?

259
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:45,042
We're done.
I'm taking some meat to my son.

260
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,250
- Some other food too.
- Of course.

261
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:08,542
- Why would she go?
- You tell me.

262
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:39,208
- You're from Ivan? From the village?
- Yes.

263
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,250
- Were you the one calling?
- Yes.

264
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,792
Let's go.

265
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:46,125
Your mitts.

266
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:14,458
- It's chilly, eh?
- It's warm, it's just cloudy.

267
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:19,375
- Too early for winter.
- You have a girl, Anzhela Ustinova?

268
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:25,167
- Call her, we gotta chat.
- Anzhela Ustinova? No idea.

269
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:30,708
Cut the crap, Veronika!
The orphan girl, black hair.

270
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,375
Black hair...

271
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:36,417
And who is this?

272
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,750
Call her here, it'll take 5 minutes.

273
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,583
OK. Hope you're not taking her
to the police station?

274
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:53,417
Last time I had to pay a fine to get
her out, plus pay you and your boss.

275
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:58,375
I'm not a millionaire, you know.

276
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,792
Relax, I won't take her.

277
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,625
Ok, I'll call her now.

278
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,875
And let her go quickly,
she has to work today.

279
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,292
I will.

280
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,125
Hello, Nariya, tell Anzhela to come down.

281
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,500
Yes, hurry her up.

282
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:35,958
I've heard there is a healer
in the village. Is that you?

283
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,333
No, that's not me.

284
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:59,333
There goes your daughter,
look carefully.

285
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,333
No. It's not her.

286
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,292
What do you mean?

287
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:17,250
Ustinova Anzhela,
born February 14, 2002.

288
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:21,292
Raised at Khoyu village orphanage,
until she was 14.

289
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:25,708
Convicted under Criminal Rule 158,
two years in correctional facility.

290
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:30,000
- Are you sure it's not her?
- No, it's not my child.

291
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:33,375
- It can't be her!
- Take a good look!

292
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,542
It's not my child! Not my baby.

293
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,083
- Where are you going?
- It's not her!

294
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,417
Wait!

295
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:50,333
- What do you want?
- How it's going?

296
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:55,500
- Chilling in the crib, no clients.
- Get in.

297
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,500
- Again?! Give me a break!
- Get in.

298
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,917
- Stop bugging me!
- I said get in!

299
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,583
Hurry.
My lunch break is almost over.

300
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:37,542
My baby. My baby.

301
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:46,167
My baby. My baby.

302
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,583
Where are you from, sister?

303
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,333
Any luck today?

304
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:50,125
Got cash? Lend some.

305
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:52,542
I'll take it.

306
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,917
Got anything else?

307
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,917
I got it first.

308
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:03,958
Anything else?

309
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:23,208
Wait, you jerk!

310
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:32,833
Wanna join us? We live here.

311
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,708
- You sure?
- Yes.

312
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,500
You're here.

313
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:28,042
How long has she been here like this?

314
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,583
Two years already.

315
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:37,208
Ok, leave us alone.
