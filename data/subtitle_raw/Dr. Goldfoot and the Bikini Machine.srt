00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:41,226
DR Goldfoot BIKINI MACHINE AND

2
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,022
It's going, Miss?

3
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,637
Here we are.

4
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,238
My speciality.

5
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,972
Cheese sandwiches.

6
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,175
Oh, I'm hungry!

7
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:48,074
You too, I hope.

8
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:55,316
A banquet fit for a queen ...

9
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:56,951
Your Majesty.

10
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,893
Her Majesty was not amused, stingy of Species!

11
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:04,894
A cheese sandwich in a cafeteria?

12
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,294
You call that a dinner?

13
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:08,931
But Louise is cheese of ?? import.

14
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:09,998
This is the famous ...

15
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,302
Louise tomorrow I have my pay.

16
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:16,539
We go out and we will have fun! Come back!

17
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:39,828
Milk.

18
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:42,966
You are fine?

19
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,136
I am doing very well.

20
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,235
And you?

21
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:47,871
Do not sit there, it's all dirty.

22
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,439
Put yourself out there preferably

23
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,674
You'll be much more comfortable.

24
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:51,974
Good thank you.

25
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,611
Thank you, thank you, sir.

26
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,213
You do not want mustard?

27
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:58,449
It's very kind of you, sir.

28
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:00,685
Taking care of a poor girl like me.

29
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:01,884
Oh, it's nothing.

30
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,356
I take the mustard and you could take too

31
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:06,724
since you eat my sandwich.

32
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,059
You are nice!

33
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:11,531
I'll tell you that there is something in you ...

34
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,830
That makes my poor little c ?? ur ...

35
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,499
pounding.

36
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:16,835
It's weird.

37
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,537
And you're weird.

38
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:19,604
I can sit?

39
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:22,441
I should be flattered.

40
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,111
M. Armstrong.

41
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:27,712
No, I'm Gamble.

42
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:28,679
Craig Gamble.

43
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:31,017
Oh, you laugh at me.

44
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:33,553
I know you are Todd Armstrong.

45
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:35,622
No, I tell you, my name is Craig Gamble.

46
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,864
I work in the headquarters of the secret services.

47
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:45,432
What is your name, my lovely?

48
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:49,604
Diane.

49
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,635
Something in your eye?

50
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,873
Old rascal.

51
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:57,412
I'll take care of you from now on.

52
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:58,544
I already have a mom.

53
00:06:58,576 --> 00:06:59,946
Moron.

54
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,716
Not like a mother.

55
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:02,648
A sister?

56
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,116
Shut up.

57
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,087
Who Does else?

58
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:07,788
You have reached the voting age,

59
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,590
and you have no idea?

60
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,859
Yes, what I mean ...

61
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,762
How would you like to kiss me?

62
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:17,632
I love that embraces me.

63
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:22,139
In fact, I'm insatiable.

64
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,676
What is a girl like you rotten

65
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,713
done in a nice area like this?

66
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,217
Why do not we go with you to talk about ...

67
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,849
sweetie?

68
00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:37,118
Chou?

69
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,988
Let's go.

70
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:49,730
Here we are.

71
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:54,772
This is not really classy, ​​but comfortable.

72
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:58,509
I like living a dream.

73
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,342
I just take your coat here, and ...

74
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:05,548
Put on your coat...

75
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,120
But my heart, I very hot without.

76
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:10,654
But you'll catch cold and die.

77
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,823
It is horribly hot here.

78
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:16,928
How can you sleep in such a small bed?

79
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,762
You see, I have a very good sleep.

80
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,497
I do not move a lot at night.

81
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,470
By cons, you move now.

82
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,769
You want something to drink?

83
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:29,507
To do what?

84
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:30,706
I thought maybe, finally ...

85
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:31,775
You would drink because ...

86
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:35,247
Come here, beautiful tiger.

87
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:36,379
Tiger?

88
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:46,924
they will never believe ..

89
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:48,926
HQ Secret Service!

90
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,428
Oh, calm down, baby!

91
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,662
Kiss Me!

92
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:52,662
I remember now!

93
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,167
You're part of the team Derby.

94
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,167
Old rascal.

95
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,404
I love you!

96
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,904
You are-and coco!

97
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:17,355
Igor!

98
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:19,793
Yes, Dr. Goldfoot?

99
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:20,926
Species of slouch!

100
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,194
I have done something wrong?

101
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,228
Something bad?

102
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,599
You did not bring the right man.

103
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,167
I love you!

104
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,535
I believe you!

105
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,337
Really?

106
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,370
Yes, it's Craig Gamble.

107
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,806
it does not have a penny.

108
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:35,074
But Dr. Goldfoot, I thought ...

109
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:35,874
You thought...

110
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:36,975
That's the problem!

111
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,713
Let me think, and everything will be better.

112
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:42,149
Create a creature as lovely ...

113
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,683
and spoil his ...

114
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,253
ammunition on a poor guy.

115
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,855
Honni be you!

116
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,022
You idiot.

117
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,729
Call at number 11.

118
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,764
You hear me, Number 11?

119
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,271
Number 11, you're on the wrong track.

120
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,072
Little chip...

121
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,381
Tu es ...

122
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,931
Is this a way to treat a lady?

123
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,067
Go away!

124
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,971
I trust you and you try to enjoy it.

125
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,403
Pig!

126
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,141
Oh, a wolf in sheep!

127
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:39,974
More Diane ...

128
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:40,975
Non!

129
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,813
Take your dirty hands off me!

130
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:44,980
Scoundrel!

131
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:49,152
More Diane ...

132
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:50,753
Sale type!

133
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,993
Help!

134
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,728
Get me out of here!

135
00:10:58,761 --> 00:10:59,829
Get me out of here!

136
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,042
What have I done wrong?

137
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,786
You know, Igor, I begin to regret

138
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,888
to have you back to life.

139
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,788
Why?

140
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:27,893
You're foolish, blunt, rude,

141
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:32,867
Illiterate, ungrateful, uncooperative, rude ...

142
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:34,566
You say rude, Dr. Goldfoot.

143
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:36,334
And unnecessary.

144
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:40,108
This is the price for having unearthed a gravedigger.

145
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:48,747
Well, we'll go somewhere.

146
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,185
He is the future husband that my computer has selected ...

147
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:53,151
for Diane.

148
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:55,822
And their paths will cross now.

149
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:58,091
Ah yes.

150
00:11:58,123 --> 00:12:00,694
Well, I was wrong, it can happen.

151
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:01,927
Igor...

152
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,997
Yes, Dr. Goldfoot?

153
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:05,498
Ferme-in.

154
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:11,904
Number 11.

155
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,339
Yes, Dr. Goldfoot.

156
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:18,114
I correct the stupid blunder of my so-called wizard.

157
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,779
Give me your adress.

158
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,481
Sloan, near Nesbitt.

159
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:29,824
Fancher is on street and away from her.

160
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:35,031
Igor, you like to do something constructive,

161
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:35,896
For change?

162
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:36,963
Yes sir.

163
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:40,202
So, get the numbers 1 to 9.

164
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:41,502
I want them to see that.

165
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:42,903
Yes sir.

166
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,538
Trotting pace!

167
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,048
1 to 9, is calling you!

168
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,881
Hurry up!

169
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:54,681
Roars!

170
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:15,070
OK, girls.

171
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:16,505
Gathering.

172
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:17,573
Now, pay attention.

173
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:20,744
Look at the monitor to learn something.

174
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:41,564
Number 11.

175
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,670
Hits the front tire.

176
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:56,450
Lean forward, and verifies it.

177
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,237
God be praised!

178
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,438
You came, darling.

179
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:23,109
I completely flat.

180
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,842
I would not say that.

181
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:27,512
The tire, my dear, the tire.

182
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,081
Oh, oh, pardon...

183
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:31,083
I have a jack in the trunk,

184
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,383
Do not let him get out, honey.

185
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,219
Three, it's the world.

186
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,721
Especially in a time like this.

187
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:38,023
Anyway, I have no alternative.

188
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,627
What I'd really like, this is an angel.

189
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,595
To drop me to the garage.

190
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:43,796
Oh, well, uh ...

191
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:45,164
Touch my wings and sail.

192
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:57,579
When people are nice to me, I'm nice to them.

193
00:14:58,477 --> 00:14:59,947
Todd Armstrong.

194
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,248
Todd Armstrong, euh...

195
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,651
Do not break the spell.

196
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,571
Whoever you are, darling,

197
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:26,008
I could eat you!

198
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,409
What took you so long?

199
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,478
I knew the moment I saw you.

200
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,713
Can I see your license?

201
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:40,691
You see, I was struck as never before.

202
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,223
Do you believe in destiny?

203
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:45,462
I believe in what brought us together, something that is.

204
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:46,795
Kiss Me.

205
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:58,582
Will you sign this, please?

206
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,343
You're an angel.

207
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,612
An angel, what an angel!

208
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,154
Oh hi ...

209
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,756
Health.

210
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:15,425
Do me a favor and Will in, okay?

211
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,127
Yes sir, right away.

212
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:31,777
And thus, the convertible luxurious Mr. Armstrong ...

213
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:35,146
disappeared in the darkness of his single life,

214
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,247
Say goodbye.

215
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,253
My dear, this is how it goes ...

216
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,586
when you're an expert.

217
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:49,928
Incidentally, my darlings ...

218
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,564
in case your promised married ...

219
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,834
or, if you will pardon the expression,

00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,300
he has a relationship,

221
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:02,111
this little bauble easily arrange the problem.

222
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,744
Simply present your rival ...

223
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:07,681
one of these elegant pair of binoculars,

224
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:09,982
the first thing she will, of course,

225
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:13,120
this is to put over her eyes to adjust.

226
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:15,588
Here, look!

227
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,858
The blades are poisoned.

228
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,358
In the space of a few seconds ...

229
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:22,094
a rival.

230
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:25,197
Silence.

231
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:28,967
Okay, follow me.

232
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,104
No. 6 ...

233
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:35,176
Number 6, this computer will provide you all what you need ...

234
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:39,515
to talk intelligently with your rich surgeon ...

235
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:41,081
in Denmark.

236
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:43,985
10 years of medicine in a single floppy disk.

237
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:44,851
Oh, you're wonderful!

238
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:45,851
Yes.

239
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:49,190
Ah, number 8.

240
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:51,659

Oh, you're amazing!

243
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,101
You can say it!

244
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,504
Number 9.

245
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:04,805
What is she doing here?

246
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:08,909
Urgent work, sir.

247
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:11,480
Number 10 will make his musical education.

248
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:13,014
She was assigned to the English composer ...

249
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:14,849
Sir Benton Bixby Brillwater.

250
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:16,351
That, I know, stupid!

251
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:17,585
It is I who have chosen!

252
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,655
Well, disconnect it, and see what she has learned.

253
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:20,789
Yes sir.

254
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,238
Stop!

255
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,375
Stop, all of you, stop it!

256
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,577
Come on, she must be registered ...

257
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:41,744
in one of the directories.

258
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:44,648
You tried Sausalito?

259
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,716
A San Jose?

260
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:49,153
But I do not know his last name.

261
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,452
All I have is Diane.

262
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:53,224
Come on, you can find it.

263
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:54,523
Look, how many girls To call Diane ...

264
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:56,758
Yes, Uncle Donald?

265
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,429
Oh I am sorry.

266
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:00,864
Yes, Uncle Donald?

267
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:03,235
Come to my office, I have to talk to you.

268
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,501
Immediately, Uncle Donald.

269
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:22,587
What is happening...

270
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:30,527
Yes, Uncle Donald?

271
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:43,240
I am sorry.

272
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,046
Leave it alone!

273
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:50,284
While the world is madly,

274
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,788
why sigh in this office ...

275
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,221
for a girl with a cafeteria?

276
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:57,757
I am outraged that you call a girl.

277
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:00,594
It's a lovely girl, very well, with character.

278
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,830
You had said nothing about his character yesterday.

279
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:04,296
Everything you spoke, it was her legs.

280
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,168
Uncle Donald is really serious.

281
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,636
Your career is serious,

282
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:13,074
and thou strikes is what you make it!

283
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:15,041
Sometimes I think you forget ...

284
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:17,344
you are a member of the headquarters of the Secret Service.

285
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:19,546
You are sick!

286
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:20,680
Yes, Uncle Donald.

287
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:22,149
'' Yes, Uncle Donald. ''

288
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,516
Oh, come here.

289
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:25,886
Leave it alone!

290
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,259
Now you see all these red flags?

291
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,128
Eventful areas.

292
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,595
South East Asia.

293
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:38,065
The Caribbean, Congo ...

294
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:40,869
So trying to figure out who is responsible?

295
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,668
Me?

296
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:44,473
I'm not talking Mickey!

297
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:49,580
The Abernathy inspector can not stand us.

298
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:50,845
there is a red flag for him.

299
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,248
-Now ... -Attention!

300
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,320
This is all your fault, Craig.

301
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:01,290
What is your code?

302
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:04,294
Double O and a half.

303
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:06,328
Double O and a half!

304
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,532
And you claim to be a secret agent!

305
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:12,735
they will never allow you to carry a weapon ...

306
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:15,740
as you will not have a figure instead of a fraction.

307
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:20,144
And how do you accomplish that?

308
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:22,479
You'll forget the girls.

309
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:28,050
You'll forget the girls.

310
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,854
You're going to change all these red flags ...

311
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,723
by blue flags.

312
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:36,328
Joyous flags, OO and a quarter.

313
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:37,626
And a half, sir.

314
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:38,694
A quarter, sir.

315
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:40,731
Yes sir.

316
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:10,761
'' Hey, you all! ''

317
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:16,835
'' We'll dance, we'll dance ''

318
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,369
You know, it's funny.

319
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,673
Never before has something like this had happened to me.

320
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,474
Bingo!

321
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:56,843
I can not believe it.

322
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,681
You drink, I hope.

323
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,181
You want to know my opinion ...

324
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:03,450
in international oil stocks?

325
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,087
Oh, that number 11 ...

326
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,756
I would like to have it as 12.

327
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,392
You're as happy as me, love?

328
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,728
I'm on a cloud ... gives.

329
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,635
You can always count on me, honey.

330
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:19,600
Tchin-tchin !

331
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,149
Hey, you do not drink too much?

332
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:08,852
Oh my God no.

333
00:24:08,884 --> 00:24:11,121
I have not even started.

334
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:12,688
Tchin-tchin !

335
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:13,656
Tchin-tchin !

336
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:26,838
Do not you think it begins ...

337
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,139
to be a little busy here?

338
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:31,309
If you went home?

339
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,978
I fear that you do not find that very romantic ...

340
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,013
in a laboratory.

341
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:37,147
A laboratory?

342
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,585
I'm assistant laboratory ..

343
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,486
a dingo scientist.

344
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,556
N ?? This is not your type.

345
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:45,855
You think I'm kidding?

346
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:46,756
Yes.

347
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,492
I will show you.

348
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,730
it is there, near ...

349
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:53,297
Shut up, Number 11.

350
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:09,448
Now I know you've drunk too much.

351
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,715
We're going home.

352
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:14,790
Oh, but it is impossible for me to go ...

353
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,622
the apartment of a gentleman,

354
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:18,157
unless we are married.

355
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:22,163
This is the first thing I learned ...

356
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:24,163
my school of good family, and I learned well.

357
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:28,002
A good reason to come to me and explain it to me.

358
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:30,171
I have not attended school good family.

359
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:33,606
Tchin-tchin !

360
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:37,144
Its good.

361
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:39,213
The approach of the denouement.

362
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,420
This finger is horribly exposed.

363
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,152
it needs a ring.

364
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:49,825
A big, big ring.

365
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:52,427
But of course I'll marry you.

366
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:53,493
A second server!

367
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:55,463
She succeeded!

368
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:56,829
She succeeded!

369
00:25:56,862 --> 00:25:59,567
More ice, please.

370
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:01,501
Boy?

371
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:02,435
You.

372
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:12,580
I immediately removed.

373
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,254
One minute, ma'am.

374
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:26,629
You just touch the bottom.

375
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,364
The papers, please.

376
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:30,632
Thank you.

377
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:35,303
Diane!

378
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:38,340
Diane, how dare you?

379
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:40,043
-What? -Nothing.

380
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:44,815
A client can flip, but it must be done on site.

381
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,051
Thank you.

382
00:26:49,718 --> 00:26:50,886
Good good good.

383
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,423
3 other debutantes ready ...

384
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:55,057
to test their wings.

385
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,325
Well let's see.

386
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:57,293
Number 3 ...

387
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,931
The king of Brazilian coffee, Senor Ortega.

388
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:00,930
Number 7 ...

389
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:03,635
The Dutch tanker, Herr van der Veer.

390
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,833
it's about your waist,

391
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,837
I am sure you will make a beautiful couple.

392
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:07,804
No. 9 ...

393
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,809
Swiss banker Webber.

394
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,444
Now you know all Exactly how?

395
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:14,476
Yes, Dr. Goldfoot.

396
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,449
Follow the good example of the number 11.

397
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:19,249
And you'll be all brides ...

398
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:20,050
rich wives.

399
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:23,856
That's it.

400
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:26,392
You almost forget your opera glasses,

401
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:29,630
in case of competition.

402
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:32,430
Number 3.

403
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:36,400
Number 7.

404
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,170
And number 9.

405
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:42,274
Well, that's it for now.

406
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:44,377
See you before you leave.

407
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,312
Right!

408
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:48,281
Forward, march!

409
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:49,615
Dr Goldfoot.

410
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:52,419
Number 12 back!

411
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:56,055
Number 12.

412
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:59,126
This one must be exceptional.

413
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,862
It is for this Spanish painter Perez Pardo.

414
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:17,643
What is that?

415
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:25,386
Well, I played the role,

416
00:28:25,418 --> 00:28:27,555
Where is the action, Doc?

417
00:28:27,587 --> 00:28:29,156
T'as gaffé.

418
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:30,089
Go back to your box!

419
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:48,143
I'd be dead again.

420
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,207
Hello dear.

421
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,076
Did you sleep well?

422
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:21,511
I have not slept at all.

423
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,015
Oh, that's horrible!

424
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,986
I hoped so you'd better mood.

425
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:31,254
I'm in the same mood, and it's terrible.

426
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:32,857
I'm sorry.

427
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:35,225
You can be, having spent our wedding night ...

428
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,492
with a screen between us.

429
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,495
But honey ...

430
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,366
My batteries were not charged.

431
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:43,602
'' Batteries were not charged? ''

432
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:44,867
What wedding night!

433
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:50,276
In fact, I did not feel ...

434
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,644
we had really married ...

435
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:55,580
because thou hast not offered my wedding gift.

436
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:57,047
Your wedding gift?

437
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,384
Good heavens, it can not wait?

438
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:01,386
Here, honey.

439
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:02,888
You are not happy?

440
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:05,056
You do not even have to go buy it.

441
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:06,791
My actions.

442
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:09,762
General Chemistry, Gas Transmission and South Central.

443
00:30:09,793 --> 00:30:11,195
How did you get access to my safe?

444
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:14,233
Listen, darling, all you have to do is sign.

445
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:16,535
But I do not have a pen.

446
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:19,472
Oh, if you got one.

447
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:23,377
But I have nothing to sign it.

448
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:42,695
That's quite a honeymoon!

449
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:46,201
Oh, and do not forget the Arapahoe shares.

450
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,034
The Arapahoe shares.

451
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,873
And if you want to be especially ...

452
00:30:52,904 --> 00:30:55,308
Particularly generous,

453
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,912
how about this building 28-story ...

454
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:59,913
You possess on East Poplard?

455
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:03,017
Sorry, but there is that I have not on me.

456
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:04,684
Oh, but you're going to get, is not it?

457
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:11,526
What are your plans now?

458
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,193
I have groceries to do.

459
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:18,369
So why do not you stand up like a good little frame,

460
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,803
and make even more money?

461
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:33,515
I do not know why fate is attacking me.

462
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:35,650
I'm a good guy.

463
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,553
Finally, I try to be.

464
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:40,323
I never forget Mother's Day.

465
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,680
I do not think we have met.

466
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,847
A moins...

467
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,249
Tell me you were not one of these vendors ...

468
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:07,917
passing to my house in Upper Bloomsbuy?

469
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:09,319
The pharmacist?

470
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:10,920
The son of the butcher, perhaps?

471
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:12,255
The son of the butcher?

472
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,456
What happens to you, Diane?

473
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:14,390
It's me, Craig Gamble.

474
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:15,057
Do you remember?

475
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:16,393
Honestly, no,

476
00:32:16,425 --> 00:32:19,264
but you know, I have a bad memory for faces.

477
00:32:19,295 --> 00:32:22,534
Especially from ordinary ones.

478
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,568
Come on, stop, would you, Diane?

479
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,568
What are you trying to do to me?

480
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,438
Come on ...

481
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,340
Now, let me!

482
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:30,774
But, Diane, I have my car here.

483
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:31,807
Stopped!

484
00:32:35,778 --> 00:32:38,150
Igor, I think he's your friend, Mr. Gamble.

485
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:43,489
Pull over to the curb.

486
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,025
I feel that the number 11 has problems.

487
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:49,863
I say this is disgusting on your part!

488
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,696
But Diane, I love you.

489
00:32:54,532 --> 00:32:55,867
lout kind!

490
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:57,269
Diane, I need you.

491
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:58,803
Number 11, come with me.

492
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:00,738
Oh no, not that!

493
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:20,959
Oh, do not worry about ?? t hand.

494
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:24,599
I have two full ridges members.

495
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:30,508
Let me see, let me see.

496
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:32,239
That's wonderful.

497
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,310
27.OOO shares of General Chemical Corporation.

498
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,515
45.OOO shares of G & T South Central.

499
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:43,019
And 60.OOO Arapahoe shares.

500
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:46,388
All of the first order of values.

501
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:48,890
Beware the road!

502
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:50,658
You're getting along brilliantly,

503
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,527
Brilliantly, number 11.

504
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,694
I do not know.

505
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:54,761
Suddenly, I have a migraine.

506
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:56,999
I think I forgot something.

507
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,767
This is probably nervous tension,

508
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,571
after struggling with that slob on the sidewalk.

509
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:05,275
That's all?

510
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,306
That's all, Doctor.

511
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:08,877
In fact, I think you forgot something.

512
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:11,847
Where is the proxy of the notary supposed to put everything in your name?

513
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:14,015
Oh, I knew there was something!

514
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:16,519
After the briefing that I made you, number 11 ...

515
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,120
is inexcusable.

516
00:34:18,152 --> 00:34:19,621
I will never forget, Doctor.

517
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:22,693
No, I'm sure, once you have been punished ...

518
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:24,126
by the chair!

519
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:25,928
Oh, no, Doctor.

520
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,928
Oh, you.

521
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,531
Beware the road!

522
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:35,606
Now let me get this straight.

523
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:38,943
-His hand fell. -That's right.

524
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:41,044
With a top alliance, I see.

525
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:43,079
His hand is detached, Uncle Donald.

526
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:46,116
And in the cafeteria, she vomited milk.

527
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:47,115
Exact.

528
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:49,418
In fact, I could go right ....

529
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:50,687
to tell you.

530
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,494
No, not about you to come talk to me about that.

531
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:58,464
Because I do not want to listen.

532
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,865
Okay, so give me your opinion at least.

533
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:03,168
Alright I'll do it.

534
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,401
You're crazy!

535
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,610
I thought I told you not to ...

536
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,045
Abernathy ...

537
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:16,180
The inspector Abernathy Washington?

538
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:17,381
Himself.

539
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:18,415
Forgive my cries ...

540
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:20,785
- I'm coming to see you. -What do you mean?

541
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:22,353
I want to know what happens.

542
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,258
You intend to come here on the coast?

543
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,793
Indeed, I come here and I want ...

544
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:29,227
I would like to see you.

545
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:31,229
A damn good job.

546
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:32,363
My office is an open book.

547
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,066
Very good.

548
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:15,838
I will give you food later, Rasputin.

549
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,777
Good good good.

550
00:38:24,676 --> 00:38:27,080
Let's see how the number 12 is doing,

551
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:31,454
as I created without your damned interference.

552
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:46,567
Now that's more like it.

553
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,736
Silhouette, complexion, posture.

554
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:50,402
Turn my dear.

555
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:54,710
Yes, this time I surpassed myself, Igor.

556
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,779
The perfect companion for Perez Pardo.

557
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,715
Yes, the artist in him will react, I'm sure.

558
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:02,683
And it will take everything he owns.

559
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:06,222
Take off your hands merchandise.

560
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:09,659
The computer will brief the number 4 in art.

561
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:11,893
-Mets-the duplex. -Yes sir.

562
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:14,296
Buddy, buddy.

563
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:24,773
Well, girls, ready to go?

564
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,507
Well, let's see now.

565
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,612
Number 4, designated as thee marry Greek tycoon ...

566
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,546
navigation, Triombos.

567
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:36,755
And you, 5, King of the South African Diamond, Peter Labomba.

568
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:37,785
Very good.

569
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:39,721
Only it turns out that these two gentlemen ...

570
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:40,789
are already married.

571
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:42,824
But with my latest system ...

572
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:44,493
to liquidate the wives,

573
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:47,097
I think you should have no problem ?? n.

574
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:48,498
What woman could resist

575
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:51,167
a beautiful lipstick.

576
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:57,277
Attractive, sweet, creamy, and shimmering.

577
00:39:57,305 --> 00:40:00,244
But when she will bring to her lips ...

578
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:04,548
You see?

579
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,684
It will disintegrate completely,

580
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:09,587
and you will have free rein.

581
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:15,795
Well, Igor takes you later at the airport.

582
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:17,727
Well, good luck!

583
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:19,662
And remember ...

584
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:23,570
Goldfoot's eyes watch over you.

585
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,670
Right!

586
00:40:25,702 --> 00:40:27,539
Forward, march!

587
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:36,713
Igor, how often ...

588
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:37,581
About the number 11 ...

589
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:38,649
I know that was not my business,

590
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:40,051
but I think it is sufficiently punished.

591
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:42,923
Finally, more could cause permanent damage ...

592
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:44,055
its circuits and transistors,

593
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:46,358
and it would no longer serve you for anything.

594
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:48,727
You're probably right, but I hate to admit it.

595
00:40:50,694 --> 00:40:51,395
One.

596
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,476
Well, I hope it made you understand ...

597
00:41:03,507 --> 00:41:05,277
the mistake you've made ...

598
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,747
by not bringing the proxy.

599
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:10,250
Yes, Dr. Goldfoot.

600
00:41:10,282 --> 00:41:12,987
Okay, I'm glad you take it that way.

601
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,990
You think you can get me the paper now?

602
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,834
Well, Igor is going to give you another hand and will arrange

603
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,636
for you to be presentable.

604
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:32,641
and I hope for your sake that you do not disappoint me.

605
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,774
Promised.

606
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,627
What makes this body, lying there?

607
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:52,425
I do not know sir.

608
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:58,169
-Who is it? -I do not know.

609
00:41:58,198 --> 00:41:59,968
This is Wittlauffer Eustache.

610
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,839
And then what Eustache Wittlauffer doing here?

611
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:04,606
it will be embalmed.

612
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:06,641
Our special funeral Deluxe 9895.

613
00:42:06,673 --> 00:42:07,508
So what?

614
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,976
Someone had to show neglect

615
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,412
and allow the carriage slide down the ramp.

616
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,583
You're going to go right away to the embalming room.

617
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:16,385
Then you will take 4 and 5 at the airport.

618
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,353
it is late, and you have enough time.

619
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:19,587
I'll take care of the number 11.

620
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,489
Trot, trot!

621
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:27,763
That's all he can say, '' trot ''.

622
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:02,398
Oncle Donald!

623
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:04,268
Oncle Donald!

624
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,770
C'est un robot, Uncle Donald!

625
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:07,037
It's a robot!

626
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,405
This must be one of the songwriters next door.

627
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:10,140
Do not worry.

628
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:11,241
he shall not come here.

629
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,278
C'est un robot, Uncle Donald!

630
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,245
It's a robot!

631
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:22,053
You see?

632
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:24,855
Oh, oncle Donald!

633
00:43:24,888 --> 00:43:27,126
Leave me, kind of moron!

634
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:31,396
Ah, this is my nephew, Craig Gamble.

635
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:32,430
Abernathy inspector.

636
00:43:32,462 --> 00:43:33,330
How are you?

637
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:34,466
It's him.

638
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:35,499
That's Igor!

639
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:39,039
The assistant to Dr. robots!

640
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,541
Mr. Pevney, this idiot is not your nephew!

641
00:43:41,572 --> 00:43:43,943
You see, he works too hard.

642
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:46,612
I repeat, I saw with Dr. Goldfoot!

643
00:43:46,644 --> 00:43:47,645
It's him...

644
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:51,451
Craig, attends, attends.

645
00:43:55,153 --> 00:43:55,921
It's you.

646
00:43:57,322 --> 00:44:00,327
Oh, by Jove, you are dangerous!

647
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:02,496
Why not go straight to your desk ...

648
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:04,264
and take a handful of aspirin?

649
00:44:04,297 --> 00:44:06,200
Take an entire bottle.

650
00:44:06,232 --> 00:44:07,934
Dr. Goldfoot has magical powers!

651
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:08,934
I know!

652
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:09,968
they could destroy the world!

653
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,437
And you have your hand in it.

654
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:12,739
No wait!

655
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:15,042
Get out of here.

656
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:17,578
I hope you will not hold against me in, Inspector.

657
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:20,214
I hired because of my sister widow.

658
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:21,381
I could not...

659
00:44:22,014 --> 00:44:24,753
Inspector?

660
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:25,552
Oh, no.

661
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:27,722
Oh, no!

662
00:44:37,998 --> 00:44:39,066
Stop!

663
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:39,699
Sit there!

664
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:40,935
Quick.

665
00:44:44,438 --> 00:44:46,509
Lower your hands.

666
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,274
Who are you?

667
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:48,810
I'm Todd Armstrong.

668
00:44:48,842 --> 00:44:52,449
And you what are you doing in my apartment?

669
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,748
Oh, let me introduce myself.

670
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:00,021
I put it in the small ...

671
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,391
I am a sick man.

672
00:45:02,423 --> 00:45:03,358
I wish to believe.

673
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:04,794
You want to get to the point?

674
00:45:04,826 --> 00:45:06,628
Mr. Armstrong, I have news for you.

675
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:08,163
Yes?

676
00:45:08,196 --> 00:45:09,666
I'd be better to buy you a drink.

677
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:11,032
That is very kind of you.

678
00:45:11,065 --> 00:45:13,169
Take one good sip.

679
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:14,036
Of course.

680
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:16,005
I will soon go the way.

681
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:17,038
I hope.

682
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:18,274
But bluntly.

683
00:45:18,307 --> 00:45:20,310
Mr. Armstrong, you are married to a robot.

684
00:45:25,114 --> 00:45:26,082
You are sick!

685
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:28,285
I assure you and I will prove it.

686
00:45:28,317 --> 00:45:29,753
Would you recognize the covenant of your wife ...

687
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:30,552
If you saw her?

688
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:32,322
Of course. Obviously.

689
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,189
Here.

690
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:43,267
Do not go, Mr. Armstrong.

691
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,969
That's not very nice.

692
00:45:48,438 --> 00:45:49,273
Come back, Mr. Armstrong.

693
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,028
Dear Todd, you promise not to sign anything.

694
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:10,563
After what you've told me, do not be ridiculous.

695
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:11,763
You take it well.

696
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:14,000
You take it well, man.

697
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:15,299
I know this is hard to accept,

698
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:19,407
but why you would make Dr. Goldfoot richer?

699
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:20,372
Exactly.

700
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,276
This is the elevator that stops?

701
00:46:24,942 --> 00:46:25,643
Yes that's it.

702
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,290
Climb it.

703
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:39,359
Remember, call me as soon as you tend the pen.

704
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:40,861
And stay quiet until my signal.

705
00:46:40,892 --> 00:46:41,893
Okay.

706
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:45,133
Attention is dangerous, clever and sexy.

707
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:47,634
Calm down, I can manage.

708
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,669
Prepare a few good glasses.

709
00:47:15,462 --> 00:47:16,230
Good evening darling.

710
00:47:16,263 --> 00:47:17,298
Good evening.

711
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:22,604
It's good to come home.

712
00:47:22,636 --> 00:47:25,141
I'll put on something more comfortable.

713
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:52,367
You saw what I saw?

714
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,636
I saw.

715
00:48:23,866 --> 00:48:27,340
Hi Angel.

716
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,905
Good evening!

717
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,947
I missed you, sweetie?

718
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:36,279
Yes!

719
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:53,231
If you missed me?

720
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,735
It will give you an idea.

721
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,173
I hear something...

722
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,312
What are you doing?

723
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:12,722
I do the inventory to see if anything is missing.

724
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:15,356
You missed me so much!

725
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:19,593
I counted the minutes until our reunion.

726
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:28,906
My ears are playing a trick on me, or I hear a noise?

727
00:49:28,934 --> 00:49:30,704
No, but you're not far away.

728
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:32,807
Wait, love, what is it?

729
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:34,708
But nothing.

730
00:49:34,741 --> 00:49:38,147
Just another piece of paper that you forgot to sign.

731
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:51,358
Oh, for what?

732
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:56,568
I suspected you'd react like this.

733
00:49:56,597 --> 00:50:00,738
You're the sweetest, sweetest, most wonderful ...

734
00:50:00,768 --> 00:50:02,571
husband a woman ever had.

735
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:03,504
Me?

736
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:04,505
Sign down there.

737
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:15,916
Perfect.

738
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,018
Now come back here ...

739
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:19,221
as fast as you can.

740
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:40,577
Diane, attends.

741
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:41,878
Where you gonna go like that?

742
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,145
Hey, come back!

743
00:50:59,528 --> 00:51:01,398
It is fantastic, Igor.

744
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,665
Simply fantastic.

745
00:51:02,698 --> 00:51:04,836
Would not it be wonderful if they were all like that?

746
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:07,439
It was my idea to let the machine ...

747
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,808
turn half an hour.

748
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,977
Now we have all the actions Mr. Armstrong ...

749
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:15,114
titles, apartments and office buildings.

750
00:51:15,144 --> 00:51:17,782
Not to mention his ranch and yachts!

751
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:19,884
This is a great day for us, Iggy.

752
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:21,153
You can tell.

753
00:51:26,123 --> 00:51:28,160
You let yourself go.

754
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:29,059
Pardon, Dr Goldfoot.

755
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:30,662
I am really sorry.

756
00:51:30,695 --> 00:51:32,932
And believe me, it will not be repeated.

757
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:34,098
Dr Goldfoot?

758
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:35,299
Yes?

759
00:51:35,332 --> 00:51:38,806
How would you like to see a diabolical trick I invented?

760
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:40,506
You invented something you want to show me?

761
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:41,473
Yes sir.

762
00:51:41,506 --> 00:51:43,910
-I can not wait to see it. -Stay here.

763
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:46,578
You invented it?

764
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:47,346
Sit there.

765
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:51,984
A briefcase.

766
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:55,389
But this is no ordinary briefcase.

767
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,225
This is something that you will really love it.

768
00:51:58,256 --> 00:51:59,692
Now wait.

769
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:04,697
there are tricks to open.

770
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,032
Yes I see.

771
00:52:06,065 --> 00:52:07,867
This stuff is really strong!

772
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,403
If ever you can open!

773
00:52:09,435 --> 00:52:10,270
Let me do it!

774
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:23,050
Awesome.

775
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:28,455
I hope he has not broken.

776
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:38,894
Who are you?

777
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:41,400
Todd Armstrong

778
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:42,966
You are in my apartment, you remember?

779
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,539
Oh, Todd.

780
00:53:46,569 --> 00:53:47,637
Diane.

781
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,040
I knew she was there.

782
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:50,175
You signed?

783
00:53:50,206 --> 00:53:51,207
Yes, I signed.

784
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,776
Oh, no ...

785
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,179
Not after what you promised me.

786
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,415
Why you did not call me?

787
00:53:56,447 --> 00:54:00,086
What has changed would have had I done?

788
00:54:00,116 --> 00:54:03,189
You told me to prepare myself some good glasses ...

789
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,457
Do not worry, I had many.

790
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:06,557
What did you mean by that?

791
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,696
I signed the power of attorney notary of your name.

792
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:19,005
Oh, excellent!

793
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:22,306
You are awesome!

794
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:25,444
Why am I laughing?

795
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:35,990
No, this is your punishment for bringing me ...

796
00:54:36,021 --> 00:54:37,891
this signature worthless.

797
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:41,597
What carelessness, inefficiency, stupidity!

798
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:44,599
The kind of things I will not tolerate.

799
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,404
Ruining my most brilliant stroke.

800
00:54:48,434 --> 00:54:49,836
Give it back to him.

801
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:05,819
Let Me In, Uncle Donald

802
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:07,822
I'm with a guy who can confirm to you ...

803
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:08,922
everything I have told you.

804
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:10,190
Surely!

805
00:55:10,222 --> 00:55:11,223
Tell him.

806
00:55:11,257 --> 00:55:12,693
C'est un robot, Uncle Donald!

807
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,861
I know.

808
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:18,901
Follow me.

809
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:27,943
Help!

810
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:30,010
Help!

811
00:55:34,048 --> 00:55:35,985
Uncle Donald, I would like to introduce you to a friend of mine,

812
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:36,752
Todd Armstrong.

813
00:55:36,784 --> 00:55:37,585
How are you?

814
00:55:41,856 --> 00:55:43,793
Mr. Armstrong will tell you, Uncle Donald.

815
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:45,929
This girl, Diane, is really a robot.

816
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:48,265
And he had to know because he married her.

817
00:55:48,296 --> 00:55:50,199
I do not want to hear about it.

818
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:51,499
he told you the truth, Mr. Pevney.

819
00:55:51,532 --> 00:55:53,469
It is a diabolical plan to sting me my money.

820
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:56,039
This maniacal Dr. Goldfoot is a genius.

821
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:58,743
I refuse to listen to you both.

822
00:55:58,774 --> 00:56:00,042
And now out both!

823
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:00,910
Outside!

824
00:56:00,943 --> 00:56:02,346
-M. Pevney-- -Dehors!

825
00:56:02,377 --> 00:56:05,282
Okay, but before leaving, take a look at that.

826
00:56:14,057 --> 00:56:16,896
M. Pevney?

827
00:56:16,926 --> 00:56:19,030
I hope you feel better.

828
00:56:27,003 --> 00:56:28,706
The amount of the sale of Mr. Armstrong Securities.

829
00:56:28,738 --> 00:56:30,141
Good!

830
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:33,981
It compensates, at least in part, my disappointment.

831
00:56:34,011 --> 00:56:36,750
Now, next step: find Mr. Armstrong.

832
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,884
The liquid estimated how much before?

833
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:39,984
It does not concern you.

834
00:56:40,017 --> 00:56:41,285
Leave me alone.

835
00:57:12,285 --> 00:57:15,891
Now, get out, you idiot, before I get angry.

836
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,721
Yes sir.

837
00:57:41,048 --> 00:57:42,650
Oh, do not be afraid.

838
00:57:42,682 --> 00:57:43,750
I am not afraid.

839
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,842
Where passer par là.

840
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:08,843
Okay.

841
00:58:14,248 --> 00:58:15,450
What are you doing?

842
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:31,700
What shall we do now?

843
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:34,071
Why not try the main door?

844
00:58:34,103 --> 00:58:35,371
It is an excellent idea!

845
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:36,004
I agree.

846
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:44,514
Visitors.

847
00:58:44,546 --> 00:58:47,251
It may be Mr. Gamble and Mr. Armstrong?

848
00:58:47,283 --> 00:58:48,818
Perhaps.

849
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:51,389
Everything comes to those who wait, Igor.

850
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,822
Lets go see.

851
00:59:05,235 --> 00:59:07,205
Welcome, gentlemen.

852
00:59:07,237 --> 00:59:09,140
It's nice to be passed.

853
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:10,942
I'm Dr. Goldfoot.

854
00:59:10,974 --> 00:59:13,044
and this is my assistant, Igor.

855
00:59:13,076 --> 00:59:14,979
And I know who you are,

856
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:19,553
vous, M. Gamble, M. Armstrong.

857
00:59:19,582 --> 00:59:20,918
I came to see Diana.

858
00:59:21,919 --> 00:59:25,225
I was wondering if you'd be kind enough ...

859
00:59:25,256 --> 00:59:26,659
to sign my guestbook.

860
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:37,769
Thank you very much.

861
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:38,904
Goodbye!

862
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:49,615
L'arc!

863
00:59:57,489 --> 00:59:59,124
Please, do not go, gentlemen.

864
00:59:59,157 --> 01:00:01,562
I would be offended if you do not give me a chance ...

865
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:03,330
to offer hospitality.

866
01:00:03,362 --> 01:00:05,199
Oh, ma machine.

867
01:00:05,231 --> 01:00:07,201
Maybe you would like.

868
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:08,201
Follow me.

869
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:13,308
Here is my bikini machine.

870
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:14,140
What I told you?

871
01:00:14,173 --> 01:00:15,508
That's who created Diana.

872
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:17,878
And all the others, too.

873
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,078
And you see this magazine?

874
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:22,384
It is between these pages that I choose ...

875
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:24,319
all husbands for my robots.

876
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:27,557
Only the richest men in the world.

877
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:29,190
And that's when you found me!

878
01:00:29,223 --> 01:00:32,329
Yes!

879
01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:33,862
Follow me.

880
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:40,069
You see these computers?

881
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,576
Well, it is with these machines That I prepare my ladies.

882
01:00:44,605 --> 01:00:46,442
Lovely, is not it?

883
01:00:46,474 --> 01:00:48,277
Once they are programmed,

884
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:50,713
they go in search of their prey.

885
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:52,681
Where is Diana, where are my actions?

886
01:00:52,713 --> 01:00:55,585
And where is the proxy of the notary with my name on it?

887
01:00:55,616 --> 01:00:57,887
But you know it has no value.

888
01:00:57,919 --> 01:00:58,987
Ah yes?

889
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,059
Do not forget that I am in the headquarters of the secret services.

890
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,394
Not according to your uncle.

891
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:06,162
Oh, come, gentlemen.

892
01:01:06,194 --> 01:01:07,697
I never discuss business before dinner,

893
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:09,599
and I insist that you are my guests.

894
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:13,672
Oh, is that you were talking about?

895
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:20,810
Diane!

896
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,378
I was looking for you...

897
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:26,350
Diane, but where are you going?

898
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,852
Wait, I want to talk to you.

899
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:33,222
After you, Mr. Gamble.

900
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,094
Do not you remember me?

901
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:38,696
I am your husband!

902
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,041
Please, gentlemen, take a seat.

903
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:13,700
I make great case of fresh fruit and gentlemen.

904
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:16,703
They are grown especially for me ...

905
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,704
in distant corners.

906
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:20,773
Des Papayes Samoa ...

907
01:02:20,805 --> 01:02:21,973
Poison!

908
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:24,211
Do not eat. It's poison.

909
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:25,444
Oh, come, gentlemen ...

910
01:02:25,477 --> 01:02:27,247
You disappoint me.

911
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:28,881
He never occur to me the idea of ​​contamination

912
01:02:28,914 --> 01:02:31,585
this wonderful fruit with poison.

913
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,522
Well, I have enough of that.

914
01:02:36,555 --> 01:02:39,060
May I ask a few questions?

915
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:40,694
After all, it's my wife.

916
01:02:40,726 --> 01:02:43,631
Please, my dear, do so!

917
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:44,229
Thank you.

918
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:45,264
Diane...

919
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:47,735
Of course, you should talk to him in Japanese.

920
01:02:51,137 --> 01:02:52,072
In Japanese?

921
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:54,642
That's all she has now.

922
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:07,457
My little Todd ...

923
01:03:07,488 --> 01:03:08,423
Petit Todd?

924
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:22,706
I will say at number 14 not to giggle like that.

925
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:24,538
Especially during dinner.

926
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,976
Gentlemen, your wine.

927
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:31,013
Chateau Frontenac, 1947.

928
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:32,948
Excellent grown, do not you think?

929
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,285
Cheers!

930
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:37,386
If you still have it tomorrow.

931
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:55,237
Oh, that miserable Igor!

932
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,706
he forgot the knives.

933
01:04:04,914 --> 01:04:06,416
Forgot knives ...

934
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:07,217
Whatever.

935
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,195
Let's go from here.

936
01:04:25,335 --> 01:04:26,437
Idiot!

937
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:31,875
The parts that I will show you ...

938
01:04:31,908 --> 01:04:34,245
are the most interesting of my studio.

939
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:35,212
A propos ...

940
01:04:35,245 --> 01:04:37,515
Here are some of my ancestors.

941
01:04:37,548 --> 01:04:38,783
This is my Great-grandfather ...

942
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:40,818
The most bloodthirsty pirate,

943
01:04:40,851 --> 01:04:43,623
which was never hanged, drowned and quartered.

944
01:04:43,654 --> 01:04:47,294
This triggered the terror of the Inquisition ...

945
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:49,529
in the peaceful village of Carpathians.

946
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,495
I like it.

947
01:04:50,528 --> 01:04:55,839
He's the boorish Sandor, a Slav.

948
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:58,304
he learned to Attila, King of the Huns, all he knew.

949
01:04:58,336 --> 01:05:00,473
An extraordinary character.

950
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:04,012
Great family resemblance, do not you think?

951
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,880
This was my first experience.

952
01:05:09,648 --> 01:05:12,387
Coupons short all this nonsense.

953
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,253
Nonsense?

954
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:17,924
Excellent, hein, Igor?

955
01:05:22,227 --> 01:05:23,630
I prefer it better when he did not laugh.

956
01:05:23,663 --> 01:05:24,731
Gentlemen!

957
01:05:24,764 --> 01:05:25,498
After you.

958
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,172
I must warn you not to try to escape,

959
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:33,741
otherwise I will be forced to use this laser.

960
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:40,746
Attention.

961
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:45,352
Look around you, gentlemen.

962
01:05:45,385 --> 01:05:49,894
Here come the disobedient and hesitant.

963
01:05:49,923 --> 01:05:51,760
It is called '' the barbershop ''.

964
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:54,998
That you made a hairstyle just at the shoulders.

965
01:05:58,064 --> 01:06:01,504
For your manicure,

966
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:04,474
And that, of course, to your shampoo.

967
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:09,678
You will never need another.

968
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:32,701
It is not possible.

969
01:06:41,677 --> 01:06:43,280
But you'll like it.

970
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:48,984
Why me?

971
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,487
Why me all the time?

972
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:57,595
Go ahead.

973
01:06:57,627 --> 01:07:01,468
And here is the medieval bridge, the stretcher that converts ...

974
01:07:01,498 --> 01:07:06,106
Instantly the little men in very large.

975
01:07:06,135 --> 01:07:08,206
And now I would like to give you a demonstration ...

976
01:07:08,238 --> 01:07:11,410
the most ingenious of the Inquisition.

977
01:07:14,378 --> 01:07:15,780
Let me see.

978
01:07:15,812 --> 01:07:16,848
Non.

979
01:07:16,881 --> 01:07:17,949
Gamble, it will not work.

980
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:20,652
But you will do just the job, Mr. Armstrong.

981
01:07:20,685 --> 01:07:21,987
You allow?

982
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:23,020
Thank you.

983
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:26,691
It is not going good, no?

984
01:07:26,724 --> 01:07:27,859
It!

985
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:33,432
It is not going good, no?

986
01:07:33,464 --> 01:07:34,966
What? It!

987
01:07:37,468 --> 01:07:38,870
It is not going good, no?

988
01:07:38,903 --> 01:07:40,606
Have said.

989
01:07:42,775 --> 01:07:45,914
Well, Mr. Armstrong is the time we expected ...

990
01:07:45,945 --> 01:07:48,316
to finally stop all this nonsense ...

991
01:07:48,346 --> 01:07:49,649
and back to business.

992
01:07:49,682 --> 01:07:55,460
So would you please sign the proxy of the notary,

993
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:58,024
or would you wait for things to fester?

994
01:07:58,056 --> 01:08:00,394
And if you return crawling with insects?

995
01:08:00,426 --> 01:08:01,928
Well answered, my friend!

996
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:02,896
In fact, he's bluffing!

997
01:08:02,929 --> 01:08:05,834
Your friend does not know me very well.

998
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:06,766
Igor!

999
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,002
Igor!

1000
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:16,443
Yes, Dr. Goldfoot?

1001
01:08:16,476 --> 01:08:18,413
See if you can persuade him to sign.

1002
01:08:18,445 --> 01:08:23,955
Should he show obstinate, I will prepare the ...

1003
01:08:23,984 --> 01:08:26,222
how to say...

1004
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:29,091
the ultimate means of persuasion?

1005
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:30,591
Yes, Dr. Goldfoot.

1006
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,830
I really have no desire to use these things on you.

1007
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:37,833
You know, I think you're a nice guy, right?

1008
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:39,000
-Yes? -No.

1009
01:08:40,735 --> 01:08:42,772
If this does not clean better than you ?? ... ??

1010
01:08:42,803 --> 01:08:44,940
I'll buy another ?? ... ??

1011
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:46,642
-Yes? -I said no.

1012
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,078
This will make you change your mind ...

1013
01:08:50,111 --> 01:08:52,615
the Borgia thigh compressor.

1014
01:08:52,646 --> 01:08:54,249
simply put it down, like this, on your thigh,

1015
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:56,418
you turn, and again, and finally,

1016
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,554
you are so bad that one go ...

1017
01:09:01,757 --> 01:09:02,558
You are fine?

1018
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,494
Oh, it hurts.

1019
01:09:04,526 --> 01:09:05,694
Bravo, Todd !

1020
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:06,862
Stay with my friend.

1021
01:09:06,895 --> 01:09:08,097
Do not sign!

1022
01:09:08,129 --> 01:09:09,432
he will sign, my friend.

1023
01:09:09,464 --> 01:09:10,899
You'll see.

1024
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:13,704
Mr. Armstrong, you will be the first victim ...

1025
01:09:13,735 --> 01:09:15,839
My new separator.

1026
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:16,974
You will love it. Have his head in the air ...

1027
01:09:17,006 --> 01:09:19,009
and the rest of your body down, right?

1028
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:25,013
You are sick?

1029
01:09:25,048 --> 01:09:25,783
You'll see.

1030
01:09:33,122 --> 01:09:35,159
I think you have stuck up.

1031
01:09:37,593 --> 01:09:38,728
Dr Goldfoot!

1032
01:09:46,369 --> 01:09:47,939
Please, release me!

1033
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:49,674
Oh, Igor, Igor!

1034
01:09:49,706 --> 01:09:51,108
moron!

1035
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,778
Why, oh why I always leave you alone?

1036
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:01,119
Up, up!

1037
01:10:02,486 --> 01:10:03,454
Farms!

1038
01:10:08,026 --> 01:10:10,463
Wail of pity when I show you ...

1039
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:13,801
what I have in store for you now.

1040
01:10:13,832 --> 01:10:17,839
Removes the necklace that is, Mr. Armstrong.

1041
01:10:17,869 --> 01:10:20,241
I'll make you a moron patented ...

1042
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:21,439
unless you do not sign it.

1043
01:10:21,473 --> 01:10:22,675
For the last time...

1044
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:23,875
Non!

1045
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:27,146
Very good.

1046
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:31,551
Working!

1047
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,119
Come on!

1048
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:34,453
Let's move!

1049
01:10:36,555 --> 01:10:37,623
Okay, it stirs!

1050
01:10:37,656 --> 01:10:39,191
Let's move!

1051
01:10:39,224 --> 01:10:41,529
The CIA will pay you what you're doing, you bastard!

1052
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,162
I will hunt you myself ....

1053
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:44,730
even if it lasts a lifetime!

1054
01:10:46,866 --> 01:10:48,269
If I am still part of the organization.

1055
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:04,753
Well, Mr. Armstrong, this is your last chance,

1056
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:07,189
unless you change your mind.

1057
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,388
We'll begin.

1058
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:16,031
So let's go.

1059
01:11:23,804 --> 01:11:25,273
Now...

1060
01:11:37,552 --> 01:11:39,890
I warned you, Mr. Armstrong.

1061
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:41,925
Do not waste time!

1062
01:11:41,957 --> 01:11:44,696
he left you very little.

1063
01:11:59,175 --> 01:12:00,544
It will help you to come back ...

1064
01:12:00,576 --> 01:12:03,916
to reason before it's too late.

1065
01:12:09,318 --> 01:12:11,455
Bring the other speed.

1066
01:12:11,487 --> 01:12:12,922
Yes sir.

1067
01:12:19,896 --> 01:12:21,466
Okay, Craig, we go.

1068
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:29,673
What am I doing here?

1069
01:12:29,706 --> 01:12:31,509
It is you who should be inside.

1070
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,478
Come on, you think you crafty?

1071
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:36,047
I still have the key.

1072
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,552
And I have these things?

1073
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:42,121
They are not cool?

1074
01:12:42,152 --> 01:12:43,221
They are really very cool.

1075
01:12:43,255 --> 01:12:45,459
They are not beautiful?

1076
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:47,092
They are beautiful.

1077
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,028
You know, it's used everywhere here, all the time.

1078
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,564
So you will not need that.

1079
01:12:51,595 --> 01:12:53,098
No, in fact, no need.

1080
01:12:56,801 --> 01:12:57,569
Come back here!

1081
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:00,740
Hurry, Igor!

1082
01:13:00,772 --> 01:13:03,644
there are only a few seconds!

1083
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,519
Hey, stop the ax!

1084
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:13,852
What?

1085
01:13:13,886 --> 01:13:15,088
The ax!

1086
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:18,126
Stop the ax!

1087
01:13:20,593 --> 01:13:22,228
The lever!

1088
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:23,363
The lever!

1089
01:13:24,964 --> 01:13:26,199
Oh, the lever!

1090
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:41,248
Comment?

1091
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,485
Remove it.

1092
01:13:44,517 --> 01:13:45,518
Quick!

1093
01:13:47,187 --> 01:13:47,855
Go.

1094
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,233
Slowly...

1095
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:01,835
Let's go from here.

1096
01:14:02,769 --> 01:14:03,704
Wait!

1097
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:04,572
And Diane?

1098
01:14:04,604 --> 01:14:05,807
Diane Forget!

1099
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,509
Come on!

1100
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:11,814
Igor!

1101
01:14:14,615 --> 01:14:16,552
You will have big problems.

1102
01:14:18,853 --> 01:14:19,988
Close the doors ...

1103
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:21,624
locked and do not let them escape!

1104
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,895
Go.

1105
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,231
Let's go from here!

1106
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,500
Igor!

1107
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,613
Hello, Doctor.

1108
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,749
I should have known!

1109
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,853
Right, I should pierce ...

1110
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,855
tone skeleton worthless with this beam,

1111
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:52,289
and let you rot ...

1112
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:03,571
My empire, everything I created is threatened.

1113
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,835
-No. -Yes.

1114
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:06,204
we need to stop them before ...

1115
01:15:06,237 --> 01:15:08,140
they prevent the police.

1116
01:15:08,172 --> 01:15:09,340
I will do my best.

1117
01:15:09,373 --> 01:15:10,943
No, not that.

1118
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:21,586
they arrive! Supports it!

1119
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,262
there's stuff on the dashboard.

1120
01:15:30,295 --> 01:15:31,897
Maybe we can lose them in the smoke screen.

1121
01:15:43,175 --> 01:15:44,678
The button!

1122
01:15:53,286 --> 01:15:54,554
Igor faster!

1123
01:15:54,586 --> 01:15:55,921
Faster!

1124
01:15:55,954 --> 01:15:57,490
I can maybe find something.

1125
01:15:57,522 --> 01:16:00,227
Concentrate on the road. I'll find something.

1126
01:16:17,577 --> 01:16:19,247
Y is tired of the game of cat and mouse, Doctor.

1127
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:20,447
We have to catch up them!

1128
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:30,191
On y va!

1129
01:16:47,242 --> 01:16:49,112
Hey, Todd, where loss!

1130
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:50,311
Perfect, continues.

1131
01:16:50,345 --> 01:16:51,447
Excellent idea.

1132
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:52,815
It happens from time to time.

1133
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,758
Deserter!

1134
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:10,534
Igor, where have you been?

1135
01:17:10,565 --> 01:17:12,970
Dr. Goldfoot, I looked for you everywhere.

1136
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:14,003
It's a pleasure to see you.

1137
01:17:14,036 --> 01:17:15,171
Now, after leading them!

1138
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:05,725
It was what street is that?

1139
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,593
Wait!

1140
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,374
Hurry up! They are close!

1141
01:18:31,016 --> 01:18:33,019
Turn right!

1142
01:18:35,588 --> 01:18:38,493
Igor, idiot!

1143
01:19:00,581 --> 01:19:03,052
Why are you listening to me when I'm wrong?

1144
01:19:17,164 --> 01:19:18,867
they are again behind us!

1145
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:21,069
Accelerate! Faster!

1146
01:19:21,101 --> 01:19:22,804
We can not go faster!

1147
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:50,266
Forward!

1148
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:02,111
they arrive!

1149
01:20:02,144 --> 01:20:03,279
Let's get out of here!

1150
01:20:24,334 --> 01:20:25,837
I think we lost them.

1151
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:29,840
Continue, continue!

1152
01:20:39,717 --> 01:20:40,552
they arrive!

1153
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:41,920
-Who? -Them!

1154
01:21:17,923 --> 01:21:19,025
they come back!

1155
01:21:41,114 --> 01:21:42,483
We will pay you back!

1156
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,155
they are always behind us?

1157
01:21:49,423 --> 01:21:50,190
Yeah!

1158
01:21:54,094 --> 01:21:55,663
It is gaining ground.

1159
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:05,909
Stop ringing that bell!

1160
01:22:12,947 --> 01:22:13,682
Stopped!

1161
01:22:38,139 --> 01:22:39,308
Run after them!

1162
01:22:45,815 --> 01:22:48,554
Keep quiet and keep going!

1163
01:22:53,657 --> 01:22:54,625
Attention !

1164
01:23:12,042 --> 01:23:13,110
I can not see!

1165
01:23:31,429 --> 01:23:32,899
My secret weapon.

1166
01:23:32,932 --> 01:23:35,771
I kept it for an emergency.

1167
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:37,069
So attack them!

1168
01:24:01,795 --> 01:24:03,531
Great, we succeeded.

1169
01:24:04,564 --> 01:24:05,565
And now?

1170
01:24:05,598 --> 01:24:06,700
file is here.

1171
01:24:08,768 --> 01:24:13,444
You and your secret weapon ...

1172
01:24:13,473 --> 01:24:17,747
AREA MISSILE EXPLOSION HAZARD

1173
01:24:26,453 --> 01:24:27,823
What shall we do now?

1174
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:29,257
I have an idea.

1175
01:24:29,289 --> 01:24:30,457
Come.

1176
01:24:31,492 --> 01:24:33,294
Dr Goldfoot! On y est!

1177
01:24:41,969 --> 01:24:45,042
Igor, idiot!

1178
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:05,028
he did not even know what had hit him.

1179
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,864
Craig, we had quite a hard week.

1180
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:09,733
How about a short break in Paris?

1181
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:10,433
I do not think so...

1182
01:25:10,465 --> 01:25:13,170
-I invite you. -Yes!

1183
01:25:13,201 --> 01:25:14,570
Goodbye, Dr. Goldfoot,

1184
01:25:14,603 --> 01:25:17,509
where you are!

1185
01:25:31,087 --> 01:25:33,391
After all we just endure,

1186
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:34,057
it feels good to relax.

1187
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:35,225
That's for sure.

1188
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:40,965
Diane?

1189
01:25:40,998 --> 01:25:42,266
Sweetheart!

1190
01:25:44,902 --> 01:25:48,943
Coffee, tea, or cuddling.

1191
01:25:48,972 --> 01:25:50,342
What do you think?

1192
01:25:54,411 --> 01:25:57,083
The minute I saw this little Austrian ...

1193
01:25:57,114 --> 01:25:59,151
it was love at first sight.

1194
01:25:59,183 --> 01:26:01,287
I am so happy that I could fly away.

1195
01:26:02,854 --> 01:26:04,056
Is love.

1196
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:26,348
THE END?
