1
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,280
OK, from center...

2
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,760
...and breathe.

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,280
Alright, good.
Same thing

4
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,960
Release shoulders...

5
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,440
Ah... that's it.

6
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,960
Once again.

7
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,960
Inhale.

8
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,080
Exhale.

9
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,960
Widen both legs.

10
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,520
Fourth position.

11
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Roll down.

12
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,960
"Violently Happy"

13
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,079
OK, yeah.
Let's start what we just did.

14
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,359
We'll do the same thing.

15
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
Choose someone to start with.

16
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Ya, can we start?

17
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
It's the time?

18
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,440
When you play SM,

19
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,719
- you can make it to total new reality.

20
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,479
You can construct, yeah.

21
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,599
When you have this
♪ -thing in a way,

22
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,480
- you're allowed to totally
follow these impulses.

23
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,000
And that's great, but...

24
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:15,079
...on the other hand,
it will never work-

25
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,414
- if you totally go against
these impulses of the others.

26
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
So, you need a sort
of sincerity to play.

27
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,719
Both sides, ja.

28
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,079
Because this is really important that you really
follow your impulses. And your topping positions-

29
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,439
- and be true to that.

30
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,920
Not try to please-

31
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,640
- because it blurs the situation.

32
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,360
Enough playing!

33
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,440
It's such fun.

34
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,920
Expand around, OK?

35
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Feel this.

36
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,760
Here we go.
Start dancing.

37
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,880
For me the concept is this like-

38
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
- every dancer-

39
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,520
- is also choreographer.
Is also creator.

40
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
Felix?

41
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,720
What?

42
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,960
- Felix?
- Yes, a moment.

43
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,000
Wait, I am coming.

44
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,279
Whenever you come
in to a new environment,

45
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,319
- you're very quickly reading-

46
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,199
- whatever is to be
read at this moment.

47
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,480
You know that...
just scanning the space-

48
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,000
- and sensing what is like,

49
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
- is happening in this environment.

50
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,360
And I remember your hands,

51
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,679
- like the skin-

52
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,359
- as the thing when you were...
You know whenever you encounter a new body.

53
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,920
There's a thing that you recognize.

54
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,920
About the first meeting.

55
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,599
Like this either the smells...

56
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,959
Sometimes it's the smell,
sometimes it's the skin.

57
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,519
And I remember you.
It was very much the kind of the...

58
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,240
...the skin on the hands, so...

59
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,319
...that I remember of our gaiety...

60
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,919
...which is also this kind of...
It recognizes me like in a sense of-

61
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,200
- It felt so very different
from my own skin.

62
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,960
In the sense of age,
in the sense of quality.

63
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,600
I think... we're not very
good at open relationship.

64
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,159
But... this are failed to
support the other one in that.

65
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,720
Because in so you
think it's a good thing.

66
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,360
It's really difficult
to accept sometimes.

67
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,280
It just hurts.
Hurts a lot.

68
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,680
It's not easy...

69
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,720
...not to blame the other person.

70
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,119
I think with this kind of questions.

71
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,400
It's really hard to
know what you want.

72
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,520
If you mean...
that has been very hard to answer.

73
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,560
Especially it was almost
said if I have no...

74
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
There is no kind of pre...

75
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,880
...kind of...

76
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,200
...research that has
been done before you.

77
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,240
- This... Is Thy song...
- Thy song...

78
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,640
Fall and feel...

79
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:20,000
Stay... Away...
Stay away...

80
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,959
- If you don't trust in me.
- Don't come in.

81
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,120
Don't come in.

82
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,160
Fuck you.

83
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Stay.

84
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,680
Are you OK?

85
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,000
Do they kill you?

86
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,000
It's already a bit...

87
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,120
I was surprised.

88
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,680
I was really surprised.

89
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,040
All this is going
to be reconstructed.

90
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,720
So...

91
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,400
...another "ruin"

92
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,040
Kater Holzig until recently.

93
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,999
Do you know what it was before?

94
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Before?
No.

95
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,440
It's all been bought
and will be made into...

96
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
...Mega-luxury apartments.

97
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,199
We have a network of
lots of different projects-

98
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,199
- and protagonists in the city-

99
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,840
- with the same aim to
design the city themselves.

100
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,799
And actually there are hardly any
sites left along the River Spree-

101
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,840
- where there is still
any kind of free space.

102
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,759
It's really crass how much
the view has changed-

103
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,039
- with all those new buildings there.

104
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,840
That's really is crass.

105
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,079
I've been in Berlin for 14 years-

106
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,960
- and the face of the city has
changed so much in those 14 years-

107
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,999
- it's no longer recognizable.

108
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,720
Well, there was my office.

109
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,119
And then I always put my
little table here in summer-

110
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,919
- because we always
had internet here.

111
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,160
I always took my little desk and
put it here with my computer-

112
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
- and I worked here
that was really lovely.

113
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,200
In contrast to my current work-

114
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,919
- here it was all about how
to design a public space-

115
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,639
- where many different
people can come together-

116
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,320
- to design and communicate.

117
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,280
And then on the other hand now
the bodywork and sex work-

118
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,240
- seems to represent the opposite.

119
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,080
Creating a space that is initially
safe and relatively closed.

120
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,880
Where one is safe to
show oneself completely-

121
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,520
- and can show oneself intimately.
- Okay.

122
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,440
I'm pretty interested in this field.

123
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,360
Hello

124
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,800
It's baking day...

125
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,600
Good, eh?
The pastry already tastes good.

126
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,187
That's the most important thing
if the pastry tastes good then...

127
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,920
...the rest will be a success.

128
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,200
But somehow I could
also imagine it with...

129
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,840
...grated orange or
something like that.

130
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,000
A touch of freshness.

131
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
That's true, yes.

132
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,680
But I don't have any grated orange.

133
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,240
Haven't you?
But you have orange.

134
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,920
Is that an organic orange?
Ah, no, it's a mandarine.

135
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,240
I don't know where they came from.

136
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,839
Do you perceive BDSM as wellness?

137
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,080
Well... those were your words.

138
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,600
Sure, you could see it like that

139
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,720
I mean that always
depends on the approach.

140
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,200
If you only do it for fun
then it's a kind of wellness.

141
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,599
But that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

142
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm not...

143
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,840
Everything doesn't
always have to...

144
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,360
...have a medicinal purpose.

145
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,480
I just think things that are
fun are inherently healthy.

146
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,959
For me BDSM was also...

147
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,160
...a way for me look
more closely at violence.

148
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,560
What is it really?

149
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,919
How does it feel?
What actually happens?

150
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,719
Radically speaking,
SM is violence.

151
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,759
Actually one can say it
is violence in the sense-

152
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,919
- that something really is
destroyed to some extent.

153
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,120
If I whip someone and then their
skin is red with a few red welts-

154
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,080
- even if it is just a couple
of bruises or a couple...

155
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,119
...the circulation is stimulated-

156
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,720
- at any rate there is a
physical modification.

157
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,720
And you can of course-

158
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,239
- see that as violence
objectively speaking.

159
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,919
But you can do that
with a tattoo as well.

160
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,360
And you can do that with
a breast enlargement.

161
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,200
After all someone
cuts open your chest-

162
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,600
- and stuffs two plastic
sacks full of silicon in there.

163
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
That sounds quite violent.

164
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,240
Er...

165
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,280
That I can do something meaningful
with pent-up anger or aggression...

166
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,120
...is of course a really astonishing
and trans-formative experience.

167
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,480
It is more, I would say an
achievement of civilization-

168
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,000
- doing that in a controlled setting.

169
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,440
SM is an extremely
positive process in principle-

170
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,680
- really a playground for adults-

171
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,079
- where they have the chance-

172
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,440
- to look more closely at
their own violent impulses.

173
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,200
So we keep that as
the title for the piece?

174
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,120
Yes.

175
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
Unknown theme?

176
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,840
- Music, then stop
- No.

177
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,240
Beginning.

178
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,000
The beginning...

179
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:13,720
...the paper come in then chat,
and laugh. - Yeah, yeah.

180
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,479
Maybe it's better if we do have
music from the beginning then-

181
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,839
- because it creates space.

182
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,839
I cannot just start moving.

183
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,639
You start moving
and they'll shut up.

184
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,319
Cause when I come,
you'll be somewhere dressed.

185
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,600
- And I come and it's there.
- Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,160
Wait there.

187
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,360
Until you cannot breathe anymore.

188
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
OK.

189
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,600
Do you see any problem?

190
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,120
Everything is flatting out.

191
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,480
But it's not a problem when
you are making the rope.

192
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,360
If needed, you untwist a bit-

193
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,400
- and you actually even cut by hand.

194
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,120
I am really happy.

195
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,600
This roll is actually wonderful.

196
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,080
We just have less possibilities.

197
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,880
And then everything flows
into this grotesque dance...

198
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,600
And now down on all fours...

199
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,160
- On all fours?
- Yes.

200
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,160
There!

201
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,200
Very nice.

202
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:28,399
Some time ago I
vaguely had in mind-

203
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,639
- that I would like to
have a whipping session.

204
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,840
And... er...

205
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,440
I'm supposed to thrash you.

206
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,040
Basically, yes.

207
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,640
- With whips.
- Yes.

208
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,279
- With expensive whips!
- With expensive whips?

209
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,440
Yeah.

210
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:47,880
Okay, yes.

211
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,860
A short while ago,
a few weeks ago...

212
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,280
...this image in my mind
became even more clearly.

213
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
We had said,
we don't want to plan it...

214
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,400
...but now I think we should,
because...

215
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,600
...I can imagine it
really well as a ritual...

216
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,399
I have the feeling...

217
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,560
...that was in a moment,
when...

218
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:18,880
...I suddenly had a clear
thought, feeling, that...

219
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,240
...I will be a grown woman
by the middle of the year.

220
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,680
Okay.
And it is supposed to be a kind of...

221
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
Seal.

222
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,200
Test.

223
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,879
Not a test but part of this transition.

224
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,480
OK.

225
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,240
And...

226
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,160
...I must admit that on one
hand I find it a bit daunting-

227
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,919
- because I know that
you are experienced-

228
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
- and that you know how to handle it.

229
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,720
On the other hand I know
you have a lot of strength-

230
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,120
- and then I think oh dear...

231
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,359
What do I get for it?

232
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,840
Er, fun!

233
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,640
- Me? - Yes, you said you
enjoy that kind of thing.

234
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,119
I enjoy it when I don't
have to work so hard-

235
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,999
- when I show the whip
and the other person...

236
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,599
...that's when I enjoy it most.

237
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
I have the most fun with the...

238
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,719
...innocent victim,
who is so scared-

239
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,960
- that you don't have to do much,
but something already happened.

240
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,439
- Yes, but I'm not scared.
- Exactly.

241
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
Someone as hard-boiled and tough
as you who knows very well-

242
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,040
- that the more you take,
the stronger you become...

243
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,560
...I have to watch
out more for myself.

244
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,960
- Yes, but...
- ...that I am not completely sucked dry.

245
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,520
Let's not get overdramatic!

246
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,520
Okay...

247
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,320
There was once a lamb.

248
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,320
The lamb was mostly moist-

249
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,440
- and asked itself then when-

250
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,320
- what on earth should I do now.

251
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,199
There was once a sheep-

252
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,600
- the sheep was mostly good-

253
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,239
- but it still asked itself why-

254
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,079
- am I really so happy.

255
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,280
Actually not happy.

256
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,039
There was once...
why always so negative?

257
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,999
It is good and asks
itself why it isn't happy.

258
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,360
Then we have a starting
point for a story.

259
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,319
If it's happy, it's boring.

260
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,400
- You are of course right. As always.
- You need a conflict.

261
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,919
- There was once a horse...
- Not negative.

262
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,960
...that had... that worked
as a computer nerd.

263
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,359
- There was nothing wrong
with the horse. - I see.

264
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,719
There was once a horse,
there was nothing wrong with it.

265
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,760
There was once a horse...

266
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,560
When people ask me
what the "Schwelle" is

267
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,160
I often say,
it is a school of wizardry.

268
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,239
That comes from this
principle of magic-

269
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,360
- that I feel such an
affinity to from theater.

270
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:20,080
Magic happens when people are free
to express themselves creatively.

271
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,200
And as I stage this all
here as a choreography-

272
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,240
- I try to create this magic.

273
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,360
I live here and I perform here.

274
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,599
In the "Schwelle" the family
has been successful-

275
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,559
- as a structural model.

276
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,800
That means I sometimes
play the daddy or mummy-

277
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,640
- which allows people to be children.

278
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,279
And in the same way it
allows me to be emotional-

279
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,159
- by sometimes being a
dictatorial daddy perhaps-

280
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,319
- or a wretched,
miserable mother-

281
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,720
- and I trust that people
will adjust flexibly.

282
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,319
And everyone gets
something from it.

283
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,879
I can tell the children what to do,
but they get something for it.

284
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,960
And in the end what
they get for it, is simply...

285
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,840
...a kind of guidance,
a kind of leadership-

286
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,080
- and leadership in fact
means nothing more than-

287
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,919
- a motivation to take
matters into their own hands-

288
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,240
- because someone simply does that.

289
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,560
And that is motivating
and that is enough.

290
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,640
It doesn't even really
have to be meaningful-

291
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,880
- but this assertion,
that there is a choice.

292
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,919
Someone must be there
who claims there is a choice.

293
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,600
Someone must be there who
claims there are possibilities-

294
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,360
- that there are changes,
improvements, that there is beauty.

295
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,120
And I make that assertion.

296
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,640
And of course that is a game,
it is a performance.

297
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,280
And so that is this interactive
performance "Schwelle".

298
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,359
And the deeper you come in-

299
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,639
- the deeper you will
experience me in situations-

300
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,519
- where I am not in the
role of daddy or mummy-

301
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
- but in other roles.

302
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,280
In the role of the child,
the role of the girl...

303
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,440
...girl Friday-in my role...

304
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,280
...in the role of the victim.

305
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,679
I have built up a
little paradise here-

306
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,360
- and I feel like the king.

307
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,520
You got lips here.

308
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,160
Yeah.

309
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
Here.

310
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,560
Now as you can see,
my clit is actually quite big.

311
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,240
Yeah.

312
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:01,759
So, the way I would have
it treated is different-

313
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,520
- to how... say someone who has the clit
this more buried would have it treated.

314
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,240
And all we see here is
the hole here and labium.

315
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,240
And all we see I have got
quite big... like forth skin here.

316
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,760
Other option is to do...
from behind if you like any pleasure.

317
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,720
Very nice.

318
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,280
If I sit like this, do you need
released and breathe if you need?

319
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
Alright.

320
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
Stop it.
Stay where you are.

321
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,680
Just feel it when you do it.

322
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,280
Don't move.

323
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,640
Don't move.

324
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
Don't move.

325
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,239
- Don't move. - Lick between
the inner lip and the outer lip.

326
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,320
Left side.
Left side.

327
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,000
Yeah on the sides-

328
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,399
- and the...
- Yes, slowly.

329
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,040
- Tip it. Tip it.
- Yeah.

330
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,840
Are you ready to leave
that and see it again?

331
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,320
Wait.

332
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,160
Are you ready?
One minute to bring it to the clients.

333
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,000
And rinse again please,
you can give me the glasses.

334
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,039
It's like this: You have receding
gums on several teeth.

335
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,759
I recommend you come
for cleaning regularly,

336
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,159
- every six months, and a
toothpaste for sensitive teeth.

337
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,159
There are various ones,
Elmex, Sensodyne...

338
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,120
- Do you use a special toothpaste or...?
- Yes, I have one that is...

339
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,040
...a mix out of coconut oil and salt.
Homemade.

340
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,240
- Okay.
- My girlfriend makes it. It's good.

341
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,080
- I'm late, sorry.
- Hello.

342
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,920
I thought, if it is about hair-

343
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,480
- then it is sure to
take much longer.

344
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,040
Did you tidy your
room up especially?

345
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,200
- Set one of these things up before?
- Yes.

346
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,200
But I can do it as well.

347
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,960
The original idea was-

348
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,760
- a book about my...

349
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,160
...experience with...

350
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,920
- ...my experience as a sex worker.
- Okay.

351
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,000
"He presses my torso down
so that my ass lifts upwards."

352
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,240
"I love showing my ass."

353
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,119
"My anus opens,
then instantly withdraws inwards-

354
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,840
- and the lining of my
cunt gets ready to open."

355
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,079
"I can feel even the
warmest drafts of air-

356
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,800
- cooling between my legs."

357
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,479
"I let myself be fucked
until I hear my friend say:"

358
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,239
"That can no longer
be morally justified."

359
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,440
"And I enjoy the pressure and the
strength that spreads through my body."

360
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,560
"You're a dirty bitch, am I right?"

361
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,519
"Something in me
struggles to affirm this."

362
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,519
"Yet this cliché-ridden sentence-

363
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,280
- perfectly personified in this moment-

364
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,960
- titivates my pride
and also my shame."

365
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,320
"It is not the money that
makes me do this job."

366
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
"Or better said: Not exclusively."

367
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,479
"As a submissive escort my task is-

368
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,679
- to serve numerous
men for good money."

369
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,799
"Yet the recognition of
the other is priceless-

370
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,999
- and the understanding
of my desire-

371
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
- while still staying
in touch with oneself."

372
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,280
"As the subordinate it is not
my job to control the game."

373
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,920
"And yet it is up to me-

374
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,520
- whether or not the paid hours
are satisfying or even enriching."

375
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,760
"And so the client himself remains
a surface for my projections."

376
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,040
"At best the client fulfills the
desire for natural dominance."

377
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,880
"My boundaries run deep-

378
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,560
- but I am not dreaming."

379
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,400
"And the day leaves incarnate traces
that the mind is not able to interpret."

380
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,440
"Beauty is not always in
the eye of the beholder-

381
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,850
- but much more in the allegory
generated by the mind."

382
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,560
"Is the body
overrated or underrated?"

383
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,360
"I this way I enter into the moment
allowing things to happen."

384
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,079
This could interest a lot of people...

385
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,720
Maybe...

386
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,199
And even back then
in my cultural work-

387
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,919
- sometimes with topics
like creative sustainability-

388
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,560
- it was sometimes hard to
communicate what I actually do-

389
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,319
- and it is getting more
and more difficult.

390
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:37,959
For most people it isn't comprehensible
purely as an experience.

391
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,720
- Your family don't know?
- No...

392
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,279
- No, I often think about telling them.
- Yeah.

393
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,639
But it's a quite delicate.

394
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,240
It's a one-way street.

395
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,240
Okay...

396
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,320
Excuse me...

397
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,600
Yes!

398
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,160
Do you speak English?

399
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,760
Are you friend of Mare?

400
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,280
Yes.

401
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,200
- And you?
- I am Felix.

402
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,720
Sit down.

403
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,880
Alright, you just feel.

404
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,679
If that is uncomfortable,

405
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,000
- and you can observe
yourself in your discomfort.

406
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,000
And understand where it comes from.

407
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,879
Because what you see
somehow is disturbing you...

408
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,760
Some things are welcoming you.

409
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,240
Which is negative.

410
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,599
While the scene is positive
because we want it, you know.

411
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,840
We decide it just to experiment.

412
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,560
But the image is strong because
we go something strong.

413
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,959
And then you might forget...
that it's a game somehow.

414
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,159
You know, and your body just
put the images as you see.

415
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,800
And you might just
react and project on it.

416
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,640
Just try to be not judgmental.

417
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,280
Just whatever comes
up for you, it's yours.

418
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,960
That's it.

419
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,999
Okay, understand.

420
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,200
Okay.

421
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,200
Can you move the ladder
to the cloakroom?

422
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,880
They are dancing feelings.

423
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,560
They are dancing.

424
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,400
What's interesting is also you never know
in which end they going to bite from.

425
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,279
- Because they can bite from both ends?
- No

426
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,160
But you just can't see it you know.

427
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,680
We are going to start with one.

428
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,200
- And I am going to put just a...
- That's good.

429
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,920
Do you have some
place where you feel?

430
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,000
Now we are just gonna...

431
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,760
...to physically
wait it decides to bite.

432
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,480
Maybe you will feel it also.

433
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,600
A bit.

434
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,040
It's just coming down to
your skin and it's a bit cold.

435
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,040
I was surprised not
to hear from you.

436
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,960
After we met last time.

437
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,319
When did we meet last time?
I assume with Mika?

438
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,919
The night of her birthday?

439
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,359
Last time I think so.

440
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,920
- Is that a question? - Yeah, it's a question.
- Are you asking seriously?

441
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,719
- Or you're just playing.
- No, I am not playing.

442
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,960
I am just trying to remember and then
the last thing popped up was that night.

443
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,039
- I suppose to ask.
- No, you got good memory.

444
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,080
I'm just...

445
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,360
...getting old.

446
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,680
How old are you?

447
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,000
55

448
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,480
Yes, that was what I was referring to

449
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And by the way it surprised?
Or... it surprised a little?

450
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,480
It surprised me that I
didn't hear from you.

00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,880
My thesis.

459
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,520
It was a small...
my first overview-

460
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,839
- of my work areas and the themes-

461
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,920
- and how it fitted together and how...

462
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,719
...the work could be implemented.

463
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,200
（IMPULSE）

464
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,759
（FREEDOM）

465
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,760
（INTUITION）

466
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,479
（PAIN）

467
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,680
A masterpiece of
Asiatic wood carving.

468
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,840
- A bit dusty...
- Mara, stop talking, come on!

469
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,640
You must always have time
for the beautiful things in life.

470
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,080
He's missing a leg.

471
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,760
He's missing...

472
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,120
Hold on. Stay.
You got to stay still.

473
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,200
Hold on.
Up there though.

474
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,800
I want...

475
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,600
Understand your fear.

476
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,200
- Hello!
- Hello...

477
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,280
- I'm Mara.
- Nice to meet you.

478
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,279
...it worked!
Want to come in?

479
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,240
We have the room to ourselves.

480
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,319
We're 5 South Tyroleans
living in Berlin, and...

481
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,039
...one day we had the idea for-

482
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,679
- a culture and society magazine.

483
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,199
...our third issue main feature is-

484
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,519
- "Power and Powerlessness"-

485
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,800
- interesting because in feminism there
are different stances towards BDSM.

486
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,279
Female masochism is the collaboration
with patriarchal structures...

487
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,240
How would you oppose it-

488
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,400
- because it's a pretty
hefty accusation?

489
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,040
As long as I am scared of
this power, I am at its mercy.

490
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,200
I want to explore my sexuality-

491
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,560
- live my sexuality-

492
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,800
- not just with one partner-

493
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,400
- but whenever,
wherever and however I want.

494
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,080
In general, those who haven't engaged
with the subject can presume-

495
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,120
- that someone who is
submissive in a BDSM session-

496
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,079
- is also submissive in their daily life.

497
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,719
I am nowhere near-

498
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,639
- forming any opinions about
whether it is right or wrong.

499
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,279
Even if someone is
submissive in their daily life-

500
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,560
- what's so wrong with that?

501
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,120
Well, first of all.

502
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,680
Because I think-

503
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,000
- that is the crux of
the matter for me-

504
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,720
- the people who are always on the
outside looking in and criticizing it.

505
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,640
Where I always say:

506
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,479
Look at your own behavior.

507
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,120
And I think a so-called
normal relationship-

508
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:02,079
- is shaped much more by
underlying power dynamics-

509
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,760
- than a BDSM relationship,
where it's clear what happens.

510
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,680
It's not about
understanding everything.

511
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,799
And I would never say
that BSDM is without risk.

512
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,000
Just...

513
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,240
...I'd say that life is
not without its risks.

514
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,599
Maybe instead of totally latex-

515
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,920
- or combining latex with something.

516
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,840
Should I look at camera?

517
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,120
Chris.

518
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,200
And you feel your breath.

519
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,960
Drop in through your
body into your pelvis.

520
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,000
You just breathe in.

521
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,400
Maybe close your
eyes for a moment.

522
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,080
Just breathe.

523
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:33,080
Yes, it is a cocks'
stimulation, it's poof!

524
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,239
You are going to wave so...
kind of orgasm you know.

525
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,519
It's really blowing.

526
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,880
And even if you don't move.

527
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,400
Just by holding...

528
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,160
...and so I feel almost nothing.

529
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,759
OK. Yeah, it's a little
bit finger in my ass-

530
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,159
- but... that's it.

531
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,880
And then suddenly
it came like a wave.

532
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,839
And it's all the body.

533
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,880
It put me in kind of arch.
Like that.

534
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,720
OK, good.

535
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,400
Good work.

536
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,960
Thank you.

537
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,720
Cross...

538
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,400
Fire...

539
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,000
Flames...

540
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,280
Imagine your hands are flames...

541
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,999
Probably on the 22 December-

542
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,239
- we'll have to have an audition
because we need two more dancers-

543
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,920
- it's actually really bloody late,
because we need good people-

544
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,720
- who should have
time for six months.

545
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,280
I don't want you to travel so much.

546
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,680
Well that's what I'd
kind of been wishing for.

547
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:11,839
You know, someone comes and says:
Here's the money, get on with it.

548
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:18,040
It's about introducing BSDM in a
mainstream way to a wide audience.

549
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,560
- And that's exactly the theme you had...
- Yes!

550
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,519
...when I was thrown out
of the art scene, exactly.

551
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,760
...and now I'm coming
from an angle, that...

552
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,759
...doesn't take place in the
art scene but in entertainment.

553
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,480
- But with the same theme?
- But with the same theme.

554
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,239
And you find that satisfying?
How come?

555
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,599
Have things progressed so
much in 10 years, or what?

556
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,399
Of course things have developed.
It has a very different...

557
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,879
Well, I'd perform old
pieces of mine again now.

558
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,000
That would be interesting too.
I think most of them were too early.

559
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,600
Actually you started "Schwelle",
because you didn't want to travel any more.

560
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,359
Well... a number of
things came together...

561
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,280
Firstly, my subsidies were gone.

562
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:12,679
And then I noticed that the
work I wanted to present-

563
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,799
- encountered difficulties
in the theater scene.

564
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,519
You know, nobody says:
Here's my theater-

565
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,599
- you can live in it,
and the audience can live there-

566
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,960
- and you can prepare food,
you can cook and sleep-

567
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,320
- and create your own society.

568
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,760
The theater of intimacy.

569
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,040
And how far should certain...

570
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,679
...how much should
the intimate space-

571
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,239
- and also the body,
be a part of the stage-

572
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,480
- a part of...

573
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,800
...available for public interaction.

574
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,879
This is an important theme,
because it is very political-

575
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,599
- because it has social consequences.
Intimacy is something-

576
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:07,840
- that exists between couples
and predominantly in society.

577
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,799
And the principle of
the public domain-

578
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:18,080
- is always linked to certain restrictions
of behavior and expression.

579
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:24,600
Of course we are in Berlin where
individual expression is relatively...

580
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,880
...relatively broad.

581
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,759
Here you can walk the
streets how you want.

582
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:35,200
It's relatively tolerant,
depending on the district...

583
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,080
Yes, there are a few rules that
I think are good and I enjoy.

584
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,559
I would like it if not everyone,
can express themselves as they want.

585
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,039
Of course it is important too.

586
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,560
But there has to be places,
where one can express oneself.

587
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,480
Free and...

588
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:56,320
...It's not just about being
free but also more honest.

589
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,760
I want us to continue living
out our relationship normally.

590
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,239
- The world's most normal relationship.
- Totally normal!

591
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,600
- And we live it as totally normal.
- Keep it up.

592
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,280
Happy anniversary.

593
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,080
Thank you.

594
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,960
So we don't need to
worry about "Schwelle"?

595
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,120
No, but "Schwelle" will
continue to develop...

596
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,240
- You know, last week... did I tell
you about the wheelchair?　-No.

597
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,839
At the last...
at the last workshop we...

598
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,839
There was a random game.

599
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,120
Imagine you are 85
and still at "Schwelle"...

600
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,079
And they wheeled me around...

601
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:46,320
...and then I was in the scene
and I was a nasty old man.

602
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,240
And then so: Yeah...

603
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:53,320
...don't be so feeble,
hit a bit harder!

604
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,799
I was totally on this trip
and it was kind of funny-

605
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,560
- it was fun in a way,
but also a bit of a horror tip.

606
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,160
Oh God, maybe it'll really
look like that in 30 years.

607
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,720
You know, that I'll still
be hanging out here...

608
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,239
...an old fart being
wheeled around and...

609
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,880
...Is there a nicer
perspective for old age?

610
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,520
I mean other than eternal youth,
but if you have to get old...

611
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,720
- Yeah, sure, somehow
- Then here at 'Schwelle'.

612
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,840
I then tried to spank someone,
but my hand was shaking...

613
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,240
Get out of this holy hall!

614
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,640
Somebody has to
be untalented here.

615
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,840
- Somebody has to have that role.
- I'll take it.

616
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,200
No you won't.

617
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,800
It's my job.

618
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,399
You're the normality representative.

619
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,280
The untalented
normality representative.

620
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,360
Dirty old man...

621
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,800
Dirty old man...

622
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:43,640
Tryin' to get laid...
While you still can...

623
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,800
While you still can...

624
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,920
For me it was always...
a fundamental question is-

625
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,400
- am I...
even allowed to be here?

626
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,519
Am I even... have I the right?

627
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,000
Do I have permission to exist?

628
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,959
I have to make myself
useful just so I can be here.

629
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,199
And so I've always
been extremely active.

630
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,360
I've always made and produced a lot.

631
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,080
But now I notice...
now... now...

632
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,559
...I'm getting older and then one
thinks more about death sometimes-

633
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,760
- and no longer existing...

634
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,479
And I notice that I find that difficult.

635
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,960
♪ Pretty girl inside, ♪
♪ she loves you ♪

636
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,840
♪ But her mother thinks it's bad ♪

637
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,640
I always feel I
haven't done enough.

638
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,800
I have to do a lot more.

639
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,520
Well, it must be painful...

640
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,880
...also to know that it
doesn't go on forever.

641
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,960
That all this will be over sometime.

642
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:19,120
Because there is so much more to
discover and experiment with.

643
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,320
Wait, I've lost my...

644
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,840
Where do they come from...

645
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,480
...these thoughts,
that you have to...

646
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,200
...that you need
permission to be here?

647
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,279
Not on my bladder!

648
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,760
- Not on your bladder?
- No...

649
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,360
With your breath-

650
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,240
- and your consciousness-

651
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,480
- you focus just on this
little spot of the touch-

652
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,720
- fully focus on this little spot-

653
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,839
- and at the same time,
you expand your consciousness-

654
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,160
- and your awareness
into your full body and-

655
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,720
- follow the sensations
into your body.

656
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,200
Thank you

657
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,480
"Schwelle 7 art products".

658
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,879
Well, for example there's
the partner toilet.

659
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,560
Partner toilet?
- I wanted to build a toilet with 2 seats.

660
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,680
So you can crap together.

661
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,680
You know, with a double seat,
it looks like this...

662
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,639
You know, with a bowl and you lift it up...

663
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:22,520
...normal needs, like husband,
child, house in the country

664
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,800
that thought never crosses your mind?

665
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:30,560
No, I don't think that's very compatible
with my life.

666
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,919
That doesn't mean you can't have that wish.

667
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,840
No, I don't have that wish.

668
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,160
And especially what is
related to these wishes.

669
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,319
Love...

670
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,599
...a future together... security...

671
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,880
...none of these wishes appeal to me.

672
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:51,839
Well the way you present
yourself as a sexual woman-

673
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,320
- everything under control,
knowing you get what you want...

674
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,519
Everything under control?
That's not true.

675
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,760
What's more fascinating is-

676
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,800
- that it's sometimes not easy-

677
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,999
- becoming aware of one's
own dynamic, patterns-

678
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,279
- and one's own sexuality-

679
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,080
- that doesn't initially make it easier.

680
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,279
And that doesn't mean-

681
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,120
- that in my relationships
or my sexuality-

682
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,600
- everything is as I wish.

683
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,160
Actually it should be something open.

684
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,160
Well right now I am preoccupied with...

685
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,600
shall we say 'opening oneself' to...

686
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,160
experimenting, in every sense.

687
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,279
Mental as well as...

688
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,520
mental, emotional, anal...

689
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,000
oral...

690
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,599
everything with an 'al' at the end...

691
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,119
opening up and letting things in.

692
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,239
Surrounding myself.

693
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,400
And that is the biggest challenge

694
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,840
also to allow myself to change.

695
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:15,400
Do you have a certain image
of the "Schwelle" in the future?

696
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,200
Short term? Long term?

697
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:36,400
I don't know, that's hard,
my lease has just been terminated.

698
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,920
So I have to think about it.
Actually it's very concrete now.

699
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,199
What will change...

700
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:48,080
If something changes
if I don't fight here...

701
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,480
For when?

702
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,160
I have a one-year period of notice.

703
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,360
We'll see.

704
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,880
Was there a reason?

705
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,520
Well, the reasons are a little unclear.

706
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,600
I'll have to see first.

707
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,320
The lack of submission, I guess.

708
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,520
So... careful!

709
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,640
I had 10 of those boxes...

710
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,160
an old stage set.

711
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,080
"Violently Happy"
