1
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
Reached? All good good?

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,840
You here would be even better

3
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,800
This rotten party will take the whole night

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Kababs are excellent. I’ll get you some?

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,160
It’s my Tuesday

6
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
Ya, tell me

7
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Yes, it was all so dirty

8
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,160
I've cleaned up the kitchen
and one room

9
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,640
When you come tomorrow,
you do the outside. Ok?

10
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,120
Yup, that adjacent room is shut,
but I'll lock it from this side

11
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,040
Yes, I'll eat. You also eat

12
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,960
Would their party food have fallen short
had they let you have some?

13
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,760
No, silly! I'm just saying

14
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,880
Ok then. I'll lock up properly
and go to bed. Bye

15
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,800
-Who’s that?
-Open the door

16
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,640
- Hey, sweetheart

17
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,840
Open the door

18
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
Open quickly

19
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,520
Who is it?

20
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,600
How does it matter?

21
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
Just open the door

22
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,360
We’ll have fun

23
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,400
Come on, open the door.
Just this once

24
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,280
Will you open or not?

25
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,840
We’re both all alone. Open the door. We’ll have fun

26
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,640
I won't stay long

27
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,640
You can clap your hands and do this on the street

28
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Now that you’re in a building your conduct has changed?

29
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
Hello, Shahrukh?

30
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,920
Where are you?

31
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
Anil is with you too, right?

32
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
Yes, please come soon!

33
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,280
Take the left at the <i>basti</i>,
you'll get here in five minutes

34
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, please hurry up

35
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
Fine

36
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,200
Fine

37
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,240
I see. Calling your admirers?

38
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,240
Am I not enough?

39
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,000
Open up!

40
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,240
Open bitch!

41
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,720
Are you going to open or not?

42
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,560
I’ll see how you stay here

43
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,280
I’ll be watching you

44
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,240
Stop your drama or I’ll get you thrown out of
this building back onto the street

45
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,320
{\an8}A Place of Our Own

46
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,440
RESTROOM

47
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
Brother, has that other girl gone?

48
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,000
Ages ago

49
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,120
She forgot her purse

50
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
Read this notice
YOUR BELONGINGS ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

51
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,760
Is there a number?

52
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,480
-Now, what should I do with this?
-Told you, leave your phone number

53
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Didi, tea?

54
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
Where are you?

55
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,080
Please try to come quickly

56
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,320
Yes, I’m sitting in Raj's shop. Come soon

57
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,960
RAJ SWEETS AND RESTAURANT

58
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,520
-You’ve come
-Tell me

59
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,440
I was so scared last night!

60
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,360
What if he had got in?

61
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Hey, it’s ok

62
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,000
I couldn't sleep all night, left
that place first thing this morning

63
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
I don't want to go back there

64
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,840
How many places can we
give up on?

65
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,080
Come. Let’s go and tackle him

66
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,000
Sir, the whole area’s like that.
Full of students

67
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,600
Vacant in the morning,
gone by evening!

68
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,000
You could check out Nehru Nagar

69
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,080
I'll get you the best house.
You have Gupta's word!

70
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,600
Fine, I'll get there soon. Okay!

71
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,760
No one actually entered, right? It’s not
like anything happened to you

72
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,080
Oh, will we wait till it happens?
How can we stay here if it's not safe?

73
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,840
And you told us it was an empty, locked
room. So how did that guy get in?

74
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,600
How would I know?
Only you can answer that!

75
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,600
What’s that supposed to mean?

76
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,280
Well, you people know all sorts.
Must have been some pal of yours

77
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,760
-Would we invite people to harass us?
-So I would? Huh! Talking rubbish!

78
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,640
This building never had
these problems before

79
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,080
Decent people live here

80
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,720
But these comings and goings of yours
have made the building unsafe

81
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,120
Right, this building is full of decency!
Everyone is decent, except the two of us

82
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,000
And most decent of all –
last night’s intruder!

83
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,760
Who told him I'm alone here?
And how did he get the key?

84
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:22,360
So you... are... accusing... me?!
Enough! Give back the keys and get out!

85
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,360
“Get out” means?

86
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,240
It means vacate the place.
I don't want to rent this flat to you

87
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,080
-Look, we are just talking!
-No, you are accusing me!

88
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,480
Enough, now pack up your stuff and get lost

89
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,080
Hey Gupta!

90
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,320
We have paid a deposit, the rent,
and your commission too!

91
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,440
Talk too much,
and I’ll see you behind bars!

92
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,400
Fine, give me your account number,
you’ll get your money back

93
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,680
You took cash, give us cash back.
We don't have any account numbers!

94
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,760
You don't have a bank account?!
What sort of a shady racket do you run?

95
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,160
Hey! What do you mean, shady racket?

96
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,480
I have messaged you the account
details, just transfer the money

97
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,160
Fine! It’ll happen.
Look at the arrogance!

98
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,760
Get going now!
Just look at their arrogance!

99
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,760
What’re you doing here? This is
still our place. Get out!

100
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,200
Come to be entertained? Morning show’s over.
Out! Just leave my home!

101
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,520
I'll call you later

102
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,280
Gupta ji has sent me

103
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,800
-Where is Gupta ji?
-He's gone out on work

104
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,520
He hasn't transferred the money yet

105
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,440
What’s that account number
you gave? Who's Harish?

106
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Tell him, whoever Harish may be,
just transfer the money there

107
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,320
You people and your shady deals...

108
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,040
And if it’s such a hassle,
let him pay us back in cash

109
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,120
Big Brother, can you back up a bit?

110
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,320
-Does she know?
-No, she doesn’t. Shush!

111
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,840
Follow us on your scooter

112
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,920
-Where are we going?
-We are going. Come

113
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,320
What? Why is she calling?

114
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,800
Yes, what?

115
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,680
Why are we going towards Rahul Nagar?

116
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
Just follow us

117
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,200
How often have I told you
not to use the phone while driving?

118
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,400
You'll end up at the police station
or the hospital, I'm telling you

119
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,080
Fine. I'm coming

120
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,640
-Should I stop?
-No, keep going. She'll come

121
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,880
Now why’s this one calling?

122
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,720
It’s ok, I have earphones

123
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,360
I'm at work ! It'll take me
a couple of hours

124
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,240
<i>Khala</i>, why does every new boy run off?

125
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,200
Now listen. Just call Neelam,
she'll manage all your work

126
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,280
There's no problem
with the ingredients!

127
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,240
You haven't got the hang of it
yet, that’s all

128
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,040
Believe me, aunty!

129
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
Shahrukh <i>miyan</i>, move aside

130
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,920
I'll call you back, I'm driving

131
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,600
This is to see the road, not to see one’s face

132
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,600
“Watch the road” – really?
Pull it off and chuck it then!

133
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,160
It’s not here for your use

134
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,280
-What does she do?
-What?

135
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,560
Where does she work?

136
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,840
-She's a counsellor at an NGO
-Is she very educated?

137
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
-Yes, she’s a graduate
-Wow!

138
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,680
Why, what did you think?

139
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
No, she seems educated,
that’s why I asked

140
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,120
Why have you brought me here?

141
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,840
At least we have a place to keep
our stuff and live for a month

142
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,720
I got the keys from Chandni this morning.
She’s gone to Jabalpur for some shows

143
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,160
You see this weather? That, plus
your tantrums - I’m fed up of both!

144
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,000
Are you just going to stand there,
Shahrukh <i>miyan</i>? How about a hand?

145
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,840
Aren’t you coming?

146
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
Then guard the stuff, ok?

147
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,400
Salaam!

148
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,320
-Here you go, good morning!
-Good morning

149
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,400
Slept well? Were you
dreaming of someone?

150
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,640
Who?

151
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
Don't you like the house?

152
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,240
After all that happened,
you still brought me here?

153
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,440
After all that happened, she still
let us have the house, be thankful!

154
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,200
Where would you be roaming otherwise?

155
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,840
I see! We’re supposed to spend
our lives being thankful?

156
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,960
So when the cop slaps us

157
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,520
should we be grateful he didn’t
beat us with his stick?

158
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,200
“Be thankful”, she keeps saying!

159
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,520
Where did this cop come from?
This is different from that, sistah!

160
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,440
And if you insist on not being indebted

161
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,360
we are paying her a month's rent

162
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,280
I see? You're right

163
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,240
So now she wants rent from us?

164
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,480
She didn't ask. I felt we should pay

165
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,640
Look, now don’t stretch this too

166
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,600
I didn't do anything wrong

167
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,160
She’d become so bossy.
How long can one take that?

168
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,800
So I refused to give her a sari.
Was that such a big crime?

169
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,440
Refusing a sari for the <i>Bhujariya </i>festival
is a very different thing

170
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,560
None of us have easy lives, no?

171
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,040
And how long will you
hang on to old grudges?

172
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,160
Let it go and hurry up now

173
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,720
Isn’t this a rather fancy colony?

174
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,720
Well, we can at least try.
And now I can afford the rent

175
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,440
Hmmm, “rent”! Fly too high and
you’ll end up flat on your face

176
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,920
Do I look okay?

177
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,760
Don't you have smaller earrings?
We're going to office!

178
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,640
Listen, lend me your scooter today?

179
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,040
I'll also check out a couple of places

180
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,520
After you drop me to office,
go wherever you wish

181
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,880
Just remember one thing

182
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,880
Pick me up on time

183
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,840
Ok madam, as you order

184
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,560
Let's go

185
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,440
Hurry up!

186
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,480
Wherever you go, look for
a house in a good area

187
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,360
We don't need a good area.
We need a roof over our heads

188
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,120
We'll look for a good area later, okay?

189
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,760
But still, try to find in a good area

190
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,680
-Here’s your office.

191
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,440
-Pick me up on time, don't be late
-Ok, as you say

192
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,560
But you meet me out here,
else I’ll push off alone!

193
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,320
Alright, just be on time

194
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,720
-What time should I be here?
-5.30

195
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,200
-Ok.
-Ok. See you. Bye.

196
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,120
-Hi, good morning!
-Hello, good morning!

197
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,280
-How are you?
-All right, and you?

198
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,720
-Not so good
-Why?

199
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,880
I was up all night
on the phone with a client

200
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,560
She has been outed to her family

201
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,560
They are pressurising her
so much that she’s feeling suicidal

202
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,120
So I was on this call all night
plus I have four sessions today

203
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,440
And I'm already exhausted!

204
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,000
I too have four sessions today,
one client’s coming from quite far

205
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,880
So I might need to spend
a long time with them

206
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,480
So let's kick off the day with
a strong cup of tea. Want some?

207
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,120
-Absolutely!
-Coming up

208
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,480
I just ran into Roshni.
Still looking for a place?

209
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,240
-If you hear of anything, let me know
-Will do

210
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,000
If you’re done with this file,
shall I put it away?

211
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,240
-So what time is that client coming?
-Any time now

212
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,120
-Sita, make me tea
-Tell Sandeep

213
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,760
-I don’t like his tea
-Sandeep, make tea for Sir

214
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,560
-Make it nicely with, ginger
-And use your head. Not the kind workers drink!

215
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,960
Oh, Sandeep bro! Make a couple
of <i>aloo parathas </i>today?

216
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,920
-Laila?
-Yes sir. I'm Laila, she's Roshni

217
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,440
Pankaj Parwana, that’s me.
I’m a writer.

218
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,160
Why were you standing outside?

219
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,960
Waiting in here is no problem. Great
view, and they serve excellent tea

220
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,640
Waiting someplace for 10 minutes
is very different for us and for you, sir

221
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,200
-Why’s that?
-They might not have let us in

222
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,600
It's only because we were
with you that we could enter

223
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,040
-Seriously?
-Yes!

224
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,320
What world are you living in?
India is a democracy!

225
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,840
Every human being
may come and go freely

226
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
Besides, we had to fight
to gain our freedom, madam!

227
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,040
You can’t get your rights
without fighting for them

228
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,680
Weren’t you going to show us a room?

229
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes, but I don't have the key
right now. No big deal!

230
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,920
I'll get the key
and we'll coordinate

231
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,320
I'll call you and we'll fix
another time to see it

232
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,000
-Tea?
-Please

233
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,040
Three cups of tea!

234
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,320
Dinesh called me a couple of days ago.
He was telling me about you

235
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,080
About your troubles with
trying to rent a house

236
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,920
Yes

237
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,200
And he also told me how you got
your job with great difficulty

238
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,720
Masters in Social Work, right?
Very impressive!

239
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,440
I'm a very curious sort of guy,
I’ve long wanted to meet people like you

240
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,480
I had seen some of you
passing by on the streets

241
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,160
But...er...never had the opportunity
to properly meet any of you

242
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,640
-Sir, smoking is not allowed
-Come on, what are you saying?

243
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Can we at least drink our own water?
Sheer robbery!

244
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,960
Go to any restaurant, hotel, theatre
you cannot carry your own water!

245
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,400
You have to buy it,
they're selling even water!

246
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,240
So did you know
right from childhood?

247
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,320
Know what?

248
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Er...I mean...your condition
...about being different

249
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,360
Different?
We all know ourselves, don’t we, sir?

250
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,200
But it's a bit difficult
to explain to others

251
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,200
Er...when did your parents become
aware of your condition?

252
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,320
Excuse me, sir. This is not
a "condition", this is our reality

253
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,480
Quite right

254
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,960
As we grow up, parents
eventually realise the truth

255
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,920
Whether they accept it or not

256
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
That’s it! This is exactly
what I wanted to know

257
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,920
Whether your parents accept it or not.
Because I’ve heard that their gangs...

258
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,280
er...come and kidnap the children

259
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,080
And you people don't want to live
with your families either

260
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,640
I don't know who you are talking about
but I was turned out of my home

261
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,240
We are on our own because
our parents don't accept us

262
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,680
If they do, society, relatives,
make our lives hell

263
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
So that's why you join the <i>gharanas </i>(houses)

264
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,360
I hear there’s a lot
of exploitation there as well

265
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,000
They have a strong hierarchy too?

266
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Sir, shall we first talk about
what we face in the outside world?

267
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Let us sort out the internal matters
of the <i>gharanas </i>(houses) ourselves

268
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,480
-So you’re a counsellor?
-Right

269
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,600
I have heard your community engages
in dubious activities...

270
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,600
Meaning, unsavoury stuff...

271
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,960
Aren’t we here to discuss
renting a room?

272
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,840
Yes

273
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,920
-Then what’s with all these questions?
-No, look, I am not judging anyone!

274
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,840
-Why are you bringing up these things?
-Er...I just wanted to know...just by the way

275
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,480
Please excuse me for a minute

276
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,320
He’s just wasting our time. Been over an hour

277
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,160
Sorry, I had to take that call

278
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,400
How about asking before taking a photo?

279
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,360
-Of course, sure!
-Delete it!

280
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,920
-Come on, it’s just for my own records!
-No, delete it right now!

281
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:25,280
There’s no need to worry!
There, it’s deleted

282
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,160
We are leaving.
Let us know about the house

283
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,120
Sure

284
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,200
What was that? Who was that?

285
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,600
I thought he'd be genuine

286
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,600
Genuine! He was a genuine bastard!

287
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,400
Come on, have some genuine tea

288
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,080
Ma’am, I got to know at the Public Toilet that my purse is with you.
Where should I collect it from

289
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,600
I’ll let you know

290
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,080
-Whose message is it?
-That same girl

291
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,880
-What’s she saying?
-About that purse she forgot

292
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,440
Hasn't the weather become pleasant?

293
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,320
Shall we make our home on that island?

294
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,360
Someone called Preeti will come.
Please give her this purse.

295
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,760
-When will she come?
-By 6pm, she said

296
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,320
Just ten more minutes.
You can give it to her yourself

297
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,360
Excuse me! Do you have my stuff?
We spoke on the phone

298
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,080
Yes, here. Please check it

299
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,360
-That’s okay.
-No, no...just check anyway

300
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,680
Thank you so much

301
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,680
-Will you join me for a cup of tea?
-Certainly!

302
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,640
Why don’t you go in too?

303
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,880
You know me, don’t you?

304
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,040
I do, Preeti

305
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,120
Oh! Now I get why you were so hesitant

306
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,800
You know each other from before!

307
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,160
-Do you still live there?
-No. I left

308
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,960
Why? I heard you were
getting married. Did you?

309
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,560
-No. That’s why I had to run away!
-Oh my my!

310
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,920
Your old area seems to be full of runaways!
This one, you, who else?

311
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,720
And did you run away on your cycle?!

312
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,040
-You look very nice now
-Thank you

313
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,080
I always knew you were different

314
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,920
And I always knew you'd run away
from home rather than marry!

315
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,440
-Looking for someone?
-Actually, a friend was to come

316
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Ah, here they are.
Meet my friend Sandy

317
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,440
-Hi, I’m Roshni
-I’m Laila

318
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,360
NEW HOPE
Social and Mental Health Counselling Centre

319
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,440
-Were those two clients tested yesterday?
-They were

320
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,960
What about the 4 o'clock meeting?

321
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,160
Had to postpone it, they called.

322
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,560
I'll let you know as soon as I hear from them

323
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
-Hi Roshni!
-Hi

324
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,000
-How are things?
-All well

325
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,600
-Is Laila here?
-Yes, inside

326
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,840
-Did you find a place yet?
-The search is on

327
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
Don’t worry, all the best!

328
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
-Do try as well!
-Absolutely!

329
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,880
-Ok Bye.
-See you!

330
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,600
How much longer, man? Look,
I took off early from work

331
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,480
Anyway, you said 5.30,
and I said I’d get here by 6!

332
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,840
We'll wait another
ten minutes, that’s all

333
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,200
Fine

334
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,000
-What did he say?
-Just being difficult

335
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,800
Let's wait another ten minutes,
then we'll leave

336
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Sorry, I got late too

337
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,360
I had finished, but the boss called
to say guests were coming

338
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,360
Chicken would be served

339
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,280
That too, slow-cooked in the clay pot,
not in the pressure cooker!

340
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,680
For their own tasks they’re all modern,
but expect traditional labour from us

341
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,680
I keep telling you to start
something of your own

342
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,040
Yes, you have. But is it
that easy, my friend?

343
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,640
Think we’ll get one of these nice rooms?

344
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,640
And the balcony, perfect to drink
evening tea, when it rains!

345
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,200
(sings a Hindi film song)

346
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,320
-Not that one!
-What shall we sing then?

347
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,560
(sings another Hindi film song)

348
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,280
You're the ones looking to rent?
Follow me

349
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,760
-Who is it?
-Madam, I’ve brought tenants to see the house

350
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,160
-Who?
-Those two

351
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,120
How often must I tell you
not to bring such people?

352
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,680
I said I wanted a proper family

353
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,560
But madam, the place has
been vacant for so long!

354
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,360
Let it stay vacant, but
we won't rent it to these people

355
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,440
Give it a try at least

356
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,280
- Ok Madam
- Next time make sure it’s a family

357
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:51,760
<i>Begumpura, the city
No grief or darkness there</i>

358
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:11,520
<i>Begumpura, the city
No grief or darkness there</i>

359
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,040
Yes, Jannat?

360
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,160
How will I manage alone, sis?

361
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,760
Listen, I have never done this sort of thing

362
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
No, I feel a bit nervous

363
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,440
What if something goes wrong?

364
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,560
Good idea, I’ll ask Roshni

365
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,600
But see if you can get someone else

366
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,360
Okay then. Bye

367
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,480
What new trap is this now?

368
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,080
Oh, that was Jannat. She has to be
in Sagar, for some case

369
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,600
Will you go with me on Friday?

370
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:51,080
I told all of you earlier, I’d rather
stay away from stuff like this

371
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,120
Please, just this once

372
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,440
Brother, listen. Boss is
leaving right now

373
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,360
Open the gate only after we’ve left, please

374
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes, I’ll handle  it

375
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,600
Didn't I say to park at the bend
and give me a missed call?

376
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,520
Why are you parked right here?

377
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,720
-Sorry, will this cause a problem?
-Let's go!

378
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,600
-But what’s the matter?
-They keep an eye on everything

379
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,160
Here, see this. How does it look?

380
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,320
Like a wedding card!
What is this?

381
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,240
You’ve put in veg biryani?!

382
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,960
Aren't you ashamed?

383
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,280
Your aunt agreed to this?

384
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,520
Lots of kids come to the
coaching class there

385
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,520
Chowmien, biryani – they relish
that stuff, they’ll lap it up!

386
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,080
Then there are all those Vegetarian
Tuesdays and Fridays...

387
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,800
-A ‘Veg Tuesday’ is sitting right here!
-I see!

388
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,680
-Khala cooks all this?
-Sure she does

389
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,720
-Did you bring my clothes?
-Here you go

390
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,760
I've told Khala to hire a couple
of helpers to get it all ready

391
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,240
I suggested a partnership
to this one, but she isn’t agreeing

392
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,640
-Whose partner are you making her?
-Khala's. Business partner

393
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,240
I don't want to be anyone's partner.
No time. I work two shifts already

394
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:22,040
-Sure, you have mighty ships sailing!
-Inshallah, that too will happen!

395
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,760
What a posh hotel!

396
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,960
-Shall I bring you their menu card?
-Sure, not that it’ll be of use!

397
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,120
-Pick us up on time, at 5
-I'll be around, don’t worry

398
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,520
Where’s the washroom?

399
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:27,760
When we try to obtain caste certificates,
they want records going back 50 years

400
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,480
-Are you Laila and Roshni?
-This way, please

401
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:38,000
We exist without documents
or govt benefits

402
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,080
For how many generations
will this carry on?

403
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,800
That’s what we want to ask
both, govt and society

404
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,520
I have put before you
the truth of our lives

405
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,360
Forgive me if we said
anything to upset you

406
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,240
Thank you, Suman

407
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:08,240
Many of us were unaware of those
complex bureaucratic and legal issues

408
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,200
And now, friends, we move to our next
session

409
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:20,440
Our panelist Laila ji is here,
along with her friend Roshni

410
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,120
We extend a warm welcome to them!
Do join us on stage

411
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:43,120
Laila and Roshni will speak of
transpeople’s challenges and struggles

412
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,320
Greetings!

413
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,080
My name is Laila
and I am a transperson

414
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:07,320
Thank you all, for giving me
the opportunity to speak here

415
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:16,680
I was asked to tell you about
the challenges we face in our lives

416
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,080
I don't know where to begin!

417
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:31,960
We are always kept out -
of society and from its progress

418
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,600
Take ration cards, identity cards, admissions

419
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,200
Or scholarships. Why aren't we included?

420
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,960
When people encounter a group
of us begging on the roads...

421
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,400
they say, "Look, these people
have come again to beg!"

422
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,800
But have you ever wondered what
brings them to the street?

423
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:03,800
I’d also like to tell all of you
that we suffer violence every day...

424
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,760
at the hands of our families,
on the roads, at workplaces

425
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,200
Now that’s never become a major issue

426
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,800
The daily murders of transpersons
don’t make it to the news media

427
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:28,520
Sometimes when a woman is raped and killed,
people hold candlelight vigils

428
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,240
But nobody’s ever lit
a single candle for us

429
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,400
Looks like we run out of candles
on such days

430
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,000
So all I want to say is
that if we have your support

431
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,000
we can make rapid progress, and
transform society's attitudes –

432
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:56,920
show we can be productive at work,
have jobs, not just clap for alms

433
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:12,480
Thank you, Laila! I’d like
to reassure you...

434
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,880
that we are all with you
on every front

435
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,840
Now I open this session for questions

436
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,480
But before that, Roshni,
would you like to add anything?

437
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,000
So please ask your questions
one at a time

438
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,400
You have a distinct culture, with
its own separate space in society

439
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,360
When you come to our homes,
we are happy to give you some money –

440
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,240
when the groups come,
for different occasions

441
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,960
So my question is - do you feel
this culture ought to be preserved?

442
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,160
This culture is also a creation
of society at large –

443
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,160
the same society that has kept us
separate, we didn’t keep it separate

444
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,480
We haven't kept aloof, it’s society
that thinks of us as different

445
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,200
This is not a culture

446
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,400
It is a burden we carry,
placed on us by society

447
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,480
Perhaps we will have to lug it
until you too come forward to change things

448
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,960
-Hi Didi!
-Hello!

449
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,200
-I really liked what you said.
-Thank you!

450
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,720
-A friend wants to speak to you
-Yes, sure

451
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,520
He will be so glad to meet you

452
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,240
-Will you meet him?
-Sure, we will

453
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,400
Could I have your phone number?

454
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,920
You know the medical store
by the hotel?

455
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,360
-Should we talk to them?
-Ask and see?

456
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,280
Yes, come soon

457
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,120
-Come on!
-Ask!

458
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,360
-Hey! Coming with us?
-What?!

459
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,840
-You available? Oh, she
seems educated!

460
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,760
Stop right there!

461
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,000
This is what you have been taught?

462
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,040
Is this what you learn in college?
Or from your parents?

463
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,640
Come back here! I’ll teach you
your first lesson!

464
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,080
Hey Sixer! You'll teach us?

465
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,400
Why are you tangling with these
insolent brats? Let’s go!

466
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,160
You are always ready to fight
anywhere, with anyone

467
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:09,000
-Let it go. They’re just kids!
-What do you mean they’re kids?!

468
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,000
Anyone can simply come along
and insult us

469
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,560
Don't we look human to them?

470
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,520
And didn’t I tell you to be on time?
Will you never understand?

471
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:50,000
<i>Do not ignore my miserable plight</i>

472
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,720
<i>Averting your gaze, weaving excuses</i>

473
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:18,880
<i>Do not ignore my miserable plight
Averting your gaze, weaving excuses</i>

474
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:36,880
<i>I cannot bear this separation, beloved
Why do you not hold me close?</i>

475
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,120
Why?

476
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,000
Consider it payment of fine from
the entire male community

477
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:51,400
Even if you drove us around your whole life,
it wouldn’t make up for all the abuse

478
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,360
But let it be –- I won't burden you
with the debts of all men!

479
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,040
<i>Two enchanting eyes
with their hundred deceptions</i>

480
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,120
Have you never used these abuses?

481
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,040
I have! That's why
I’m feeling so terrible

482
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,680
I’ve seen how it takes just one word
to cancel out someone's life

483
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,240
Good! If you’ve understood that,
our pain has been of some use.

484
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,680
Now get going!

485
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:47,160
<i>Nobody cares to tell my beloved
of my state</i>

486
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:57,560
<i>Like the burning lamp, each part volatile
I turn into a whirling celestial being</i>

487
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:19,240
<i>No sleep for my eyes, no peace for the body
Neither do you come, nor send your address</i>

488
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:28,040
<i>No peace for the body
No sleep for my eyes</i>

489
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,520
<i>No peace for the body</i>

490
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,720
<i>No peace for the body</i>

491
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:49,440
<i>No sleep for my eyes, no peace for the body
Neither do you come, nor send your address</i>

492
00:56:49,480 --> 00:57:02,400
<i>Do not ignore my miserable plight
Averting your gaze, weaving excuses</i>

493
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,320
The longer you look, the more
you’ll feel like calling

494
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,040
Let it be!

495
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,840
Look, friends!

496
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,560
This is the very sari that

497
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,080
drew a wedge between two fond hearts!

498
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,200
That built a wall between Laila and Chandni!

499
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,000
How did your meeting go
with that woman yesterday?

500
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,000
I was a little late,
so couldn't meet the doctor

501
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,880
Laila ma'am, there’s someone
waiting for you outside

502
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,320
-Who? Ask them in
-They insist on speaking to you outside

503
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,040
-How are you?
-Fine, how are you, Sis?

504
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,640
I’m fine too. Who’s come with you??

505
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,920
-Elder brother
-Right. And he wouldn’t come in

506
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:36,000
-So how's everyone at home?
-Granny’s very ill, Sis

507
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:43,840
-What’s wrong with her?
-Her blood pressure. It’s shot up again.

508
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,280
She misses you. Keeps saying your name.

509
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,520
Okay, I'll come tomorrow

510
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,240
-You'll come for sure?
-Yes

511
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,760
But...

512
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,800
I understand

513
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,880
Sorry, Sis! But please come tomorrow

514
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,400
-For Granny’s sake
-I will

515
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,480
Don’t delay, Sis. She has
very little time left

516
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,400
Yes, I'll come

517
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,280
When are you returning
the rest of the money?

518
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,280
You had taken 15,000 as
advance, rent and commission

519
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,720
So what if the name is different?!
I’ve sent it from my number, right?

520
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,640
You can keep that 4000 too!

521
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,440
Hi Preeti! How are you?

522
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:26,800
She’s on a visit home. She'll be in
a bad mood for a while when she’s back

523
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,720
A picnic? Sure, make a plan!

524
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,960
Hi! Remember I told you
about my friend?

525
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:08,880
<i>Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up friend!
Pick it up</i>

526
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,720
<i>Soaring from this side to the other</i>

527
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,520
<i>Go off beat and sing your song</i>

528
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:26,280
<i>Soaring from this side to the other</i>

529
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:32,160
<i>Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up friend!
Pick it up</i>

530
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,960
<i>Swing from one branch to the other</i>

531
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,800
<i>Like a bird hop from one tree to the other</i>

532
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,960
-Hey!
-What’s the matter?

533
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,320
Come with me! Looks like
something's happened to Roshni

534
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,680
What?!

535
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,600
I’ve been dialling her number for ages,
but she's not answering

536
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,080
Somebody's been beaten up
at her employer's. I got a call

537
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,440
-I have a feeling it’s Roshni
-Her phone’s still off

538
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,800
Let’s go, quick!

539
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,080
-Where?
-In here

540
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,240
How did all this happen?

541
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:11,000
Sir got to know today.
Then things really escalated

542
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,440
They dragged and hit mercilessly

543
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:18,359
Many of his friends were with him.
All very drunk

544
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,359
But how did they get to know?

545
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,080
TRANSGENDERS IN THE CITY

546
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:43,640
-We should file a police report
-No point

547
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,000
That's right. The Superintendent
of Police was there too

548
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,359
Let's go to the hospital first.

549
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,520
We could go to JP hospital

550
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,080
-No
-Why not?

551
01:08:54,120 --> 01:09:01,600
Not there. The cops will ask endless questions
and then poke fun at us

552
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,680
Then where?

553
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,279
Let’s go to our usual doctor

554
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:15,080
Shahrukh! Get me a strong painkiller,
the pain is unbearable

555
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,760
-Ouch! Not that arm, that's gone
-Sorry!

556
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,160
-You could have called me
-The phone is in a worse state than I am

557
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,640
Shahrukh, would you get my bag?

558
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,440
Look at this! They’ve carried
such a huge article

559
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,880
They might at least
have used a better photo

560
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,880
Here, read it!

561
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,720
We should file a case against them too

562
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,440
How could they publish this
without permission?

563
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,000
Are our lives some exhibit?

564
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,520
He's advancing his career,
and getting us thrashed!

565
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,680
This happens to us all the time

566
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,400
This is so wrong!

567
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,120
And he’s written such rubbish!

568
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:08,120
If I get my hands on this
‘Pankaj Dubey Parwana’, I’ll show him!

569
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,040
Go see, it must be Shahrukh

570
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:20,920
Sandeep?

571
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,160
Oh, it’s you! Please come in

572
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,280
-So you’re colleagues?
-Yes, that’s right

573
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,840
Do sit down

574
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,440
-Feeling better?
-Feeling better and freer too!

575
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,400
I was so afraid for you that day

576
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,280
Such a big crowd they were.

577
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,840
The violence is one thing, but
the humiliation is unbearable

578
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,600
Those educated officers,
how filthy they are inside

579
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,440
How can you beat someone up
so brutally?

580
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,120
And so shamelessly, in front of
his wife and kids?

581
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,760
And the wife and kids
were just watching it happen

582
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,240
Have they no shame either?

583
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,400
I feel like quitting,
but can’t afford to

584
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,200
Oh, you shouldn’t have

585
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,080
One has to keep one's mouth shut

586
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,080
They are really terrible people

587
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:44,720
You have your own compulsions.
Working there is its own punishment

588
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,760
You take care of yourself too

589
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,720
They're going to file a case
against you, maybe theft

590
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,600
The case should be against them!

591
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,720
Under Sections 354 and 325

592
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,480
-You seem well-versed in law!
-I know a little bit

593
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:07,560
What proof do we have?
And who'll believe us?

594
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,520
We've been to the police before.
Always in vain

595
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,240
There’s no harm trying.
I know a few lawyers

596
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,440
No point, we've tried it all

597
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,640
It's time for my shift.
I’ll have to leave now

598
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,000
-If I can do anything, let me know
-Sure

599
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,880
Oh, he's sent me my video!

600
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:02,120
-Now this we can give the cops!
-First, let's make it viral

601
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,680
-What’s the use of that?
- At least the truth will come out!

602
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,880
-What if they still file a case?
-They'll do that anyway

603
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,360
Post it on your Human Rights group too

604
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,080
I seem to have forgotten the key!

605
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:51,240
Great! Like this rain wasn’t
bad enough already. Now hurry!

606
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,720
It’ll take just two minutes!

607
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,960
Auto drivers will never learn,
especially the ones in Bhopal!

608
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,760
-Right, break my other arm too!
-It’s just in the next lane

609
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,160
What matters is Khala’s agreed.
You can take it from there now.

610
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,720
You finally pushed me into this partnership!

611
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,720
Well, I got you the house too.
What's the problem?

612
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,560
Not for free, right?

613
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:19,040
It's a 70-30 partnership.
Your Khala is quite shrewd!

614
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,280
She's looked after the business
alone since we were kids

615
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,080
She has to be shrewd!

616
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:32,080
And at heart, Khala’s okay. So she
scolds and has a temper. No big deal

617
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,680
You’re quite sharp yourself! It could
well become a 50-50 partnership in time

618
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,720
Just stay on good terms with Khala

619
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,760
That’s all fine, the house is good too.
Let’s just hope “madam” approves!

620
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:52,440
It's your job to convince “madam”.
Oh, there she is!

621
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:01,920
-Where were you two?
-Picking up the keys

622
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,960
-You can close your umbrella
-We are enjoying the weather!

623
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,400
-Fine, keep enjoying it!
-We will!

624
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,000
And you’re also roaming about
in your raincoat

625
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,000
Can the nominee be someone
other than a family member?

626
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,480
If not, I don't want any insurance

627
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,600
And who is this "Harish"
you’re referring to?

628
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,040
There's no one by that name

629
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,320
Please don't call again

630
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:22,320
Thank you for sharing your house
For the things in the past, sorry!

631
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,240
-How are you?
-All right

632
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,320
I am very ashamed about that day.
I hope you can forgive us

633
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,720
You know what he’s like
when he’s drunk

634
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,400
You’ve witnessed it all

635
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,080
After drinking, he’s come to hit me too

636
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,920
-Are you working anywhere?
-No

637
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,280
-Should I put in a word somewhere?
-Let it be

638
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:54,520
After your video, an enquiry has been
instated against him

639
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,000
It had to be done

640
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,360
-Take it back
-What?!

641
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,520
If he’s suspended, our lives
will fall apart

642
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,600
-Sumit's studies, his entire future...
-And what about me?

643
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:14,040
Am apologizing for that. And if you want
I’ll get him to apologise too

644
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,760
Look, I’m speaking to you as a woman

645
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,640
You think of yourself as a woman, right?

646
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,160
Surely you can understand my pain

647
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,400
And what about my pain?

648
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,880
Now that you’re in trouble,
I have become a woman to you

649
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:34,560
Are we the same? Would this
have happened to you?

650
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,800
And you were standing right there!
You are a part of this

651
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:43,960
You lied as well. Never told us
about your caste, or your…

652
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,000
Anyway, I don’t believe in all this

653
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,400
But in his home you can’t
even cross the threshold

654
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,120
And you made your way
into my kitchen!

655
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,160
If I had told you,
would you have hired me?

656
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:02,240
I am what I am. This is
your problem, not mine

657
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,960
Let it go now.
Just forget and forgive

658
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,080
He still wants to file
a case against you

659
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,440
But I’ve stopped him. I said
I would persuade you

660
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,480
But if things go any further,
you will truly be in trouble

661
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,840
Even I won't be able to help you then

662
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,760
Are you here to save me,
your husband, or yourself?

663
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,520
-Everyone
-That is not possible

664
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,600
Joshi madam, it’s time
you decided where you stand

665
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,000
I’ll keep fighting. I’m not
scared of you people anymore

666
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,800
Do what you will!

667
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:54,520
I would have made you tea,
but you now you won’t drink it, will you?

668
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:12,040
<i>Khusrau, deceived, seeks the right
Of redressal on Judgement Day</i>

669
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:20,960
<i>I will save these curses against my soul ...</i>

670
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,440
<i>Till I come to an agreement with my beloved</i>

671
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:34,440
<i>I will save these curses against my soul
Till I come to an agreement with my beloved</i>

672
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,880
Hey Shahrukh,
have you spoken to Khala?

673
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,800
Of course, I’ve asked her!

674
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,120
-So they’ll be staying here?
- Yes, they will

675
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,560
-What will they do here?
-What do you mean?

676
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,600
Whatever people do in their
homes. Eat, bathe, sleep!

677
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,200
Are you the ones
who’ll be living here?

678
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,200
Shahrukh, have you asked Khala?

679
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,880
Of course! Can I give out the room
without Khala’s permission?!

680
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,000
-What will you do?
-Live, just like others do

681
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,680
-Let me know if you need anything
-Thanks

682
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,360
-All of you will live here?
-Yes

683
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,400
-Shahrukh, have you asked Khala?
-Of course we’ve asked Khala!

684
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,440
-And what will you be doing here?
-The same things that others do!

685
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,400
-Here, have some water
-No, I’m fine.

686
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:48,600
-If you need anything, do tell me
-We will

687
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,000
Listen!

688
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,600
What?

689
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,880
Joshi is going to be suspended!

690
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,320
Nothing will happen.
They'll save him in the end

691
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,520
Do you like our home?

692
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:24,240
At last we have a place of our own

693
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,320
After searching the whole city

694
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,440
we’ve ended up next to a drain!

695
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,600
Close your eyes and imagine
we’re sitting by a river

696
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,720
I don't want to live in a dream world

697
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,760
To carry on the fight,
one needs a strong foundation

698
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,160
But that’s okay. We’ll continue
our struggle from here!

699
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:14,640
<i>Begumpura, the city
No grief nor darkness here</i>

700
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:28,320
<i>Begumpura, the city
No grief nor darkness here</i>

701
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:51,360
<i>No worry nor regrets
Nor any ownership</i>

702
01:24:51,400 --> 01:25:07,360
<i>No fear of transgression
No pity, nor devastation</i>

703
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:19,400
<i>Now have I conceived such a land
Where wellness is eternal, my friend</i>

704
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:26,240
<i>Begumpura...</i>

705
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:52,080
<i>A never-ending reign prevails
None second, nor third, but equal all</i>

706
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:12,920
<i>Thriving, living, prosperous
Ever content, each resident</i>

707
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:23,600
<i>Begumpura...</i>

708
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:40,600
<i>Where one may roam as the heart may please</i>

709
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:52,520
<i>Where the strictures of ancient law books cease</i>

710
01:26:54,120 --> 01:27:12,720
<i>Says Ravidas, the free tanner –
All those who are willing to live here are our friends</i>

711
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:18,000
<i>Begumpura...</i>
