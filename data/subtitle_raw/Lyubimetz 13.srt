<i>Footballer R. Golubov from Varna -
Author of five goals</i>

22
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,000
She loves him.
- Not for sure.

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
That's unheard of!
They were together at the match.

24
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,300
I was ill for our team.
- Good!

25
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,500
Radoslav? Do you like her?

26
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,900
No!

27
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,000
<i>As he drinks, he sees your lovely image</i>

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>I would like to gently hug you
at this night's hour</i>

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>To kiss you in oblivion,
even with a laugh, despising death.</i>

30
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,800
<i>Despising death...</i>

31
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,200
<i>Oh, Columbine, give me
a sign of love</i>

32
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,600
<i>Harlequin strongly desires you.</i>

33
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>Open to him again, warm up his heart.</i>

34
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,800
<i>He yearns for you...</i>

35
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,000
<i>Harlequin!</i>

36
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,300
Elena, when you are near,

37
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,500
I can perform the whole
Sofia's "People's Opera" repertoire!

38
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,400
For free?
- So heartless you are!

39
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,100
For myself, your attention is the biggest fee.

40
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,300
He treats her with songs.
- Can't be!

41
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Look at him...

42
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
So simple.

43
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Leans toward her...

44
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,600
You die only once.

45
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,600
May no one watch through binoculars!

46
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Good afternoon! How are you?

47
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,800
I apologize for stopping you in the street.

48
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,900
May I escort you?
- Only to the corner, please.

49
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,700
I am very pleased. Golubov.
And what's your name?

50
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,800
Have you watched the movie "Obsessive"?
- Yes!

51
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,400
Oh no. I did not watch.
- Well, we're around the corner.

52
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
If you don't mind, shall we
cross the square together?

53
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,500
I can not refuse the author of five goals.
- Ah, speaking of that...

54
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
You are the cause of the fifth.
I scored in anger

55
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,100
because you smiled at the tenor.
- Oh, poor adversary.

56
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,400
It's good that I smiled only once.

57
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,100
There's nothing funny
in blocking oxygen off!

58
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,600
Sorry that I prevented
your underwater walk.

59
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,900
If it's not a secret, what are you
looking for on the seabed?

60
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,900
I see that this is for you.
It's actually interesting.

61
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm seeking therapeutic algae
for my chronic gastritis.

62
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Furthermore, I'm not angry anymore
and I suggest to get acquainted.

63
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,800
Nikolai Mladenov.
- Goncharova. - Golubov...

64
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,100
I guess you are newlyweds?
- No, no.

65
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,900
But that's great, because
an old bachelor lives lonely.

66
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,800
42 years ago, my Daniela skipped out on me.

67
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,900
And now, as you can see,
I'm looking for seaweed alone.

68
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,700
I know one romantic restaurant.
Only for lovers and friends.

69
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,200
I invite you to a baked mullet in the evening.
- I agree! What about you?

70
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,300
Tonight I was invited to the opera,
and then I leave for Sofia.

71
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Elena, you know... We don't need
to skip out on each other.

72
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,300
Come to Sofia.

73
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,100
Elena, the suitcase.
- Good evening!

74
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Oh, and you are coming as well?
- Yes of course.

75
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,300
Young man, do not be afraid.
I will take care of your fiancÃ©e.

76
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,100
I bring luck in love!

77
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,900
But, Elena, I do not know your address!
- Write it down.

78
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,400
Nowhere.

79
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Thank you. Excuse me.

80
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,400
2 Brestovitsa Street, 74A,

81
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,400
third entrance, fourth floor.
Phone number: 9-37-84.

82
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
Written down.

83
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,500
The address remained in the wallet!

84
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,700
<i>July 29th, Monday - the eighth pharmacy
"Chamomile for rinsing"</i>

85
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,350
Vitosha! Vitosha!

86
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Controller Goga, it seems to me,

87
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,900
that my employees do not
support their team enough.

88
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Where did you buy this, Fileva?
- On the fish market, Dondukova street.

89
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,900
How big!

90
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,700
Comrade superior, aunt's aunt Pena

91
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,300
and the cashier Fileva are present
at the match only formally.

92
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,700
They don't even follow the game!

93
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Vitosha! Vitosha!

94
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,600
Comrade Strogov! Accountant Lychko

95
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,700
thinks of something extraneous,
like the trade union!

96
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,700
Our union will not tolerate
in their ranks those officials

97
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,200
who haven't a single drop of
football patriotism!

98
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Our Parmakov is something! Believe me, Zhenya,
he scored five goals in front of my eyes!

99
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,600
You know how well he plays.

100
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,200
Goal!

101
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,300
Goal! Bravo, falcons!

102
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Comrade Strogov! Now or never!
The referee judges in Vitosha's favour.

103
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,200
Will you return Stancho Parmakov?

104
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,900
Will you count the goal?

105
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,800
I see that you do not specifically
look into my eyes. Why?

106
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,400
Why are you behaving like
a soulless bureaucrat?

107
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,900
<i>State enterprise "Vitosha"</i>

108
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,300
<i>Devoted to football -
Devoted to the trade union!</i>

109
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,900
Well, he's blossoming.
- Because he has everything forgiven.

110
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,200
Guys, tomorrow is the last day
for physical examination.

111
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,100
We're waiting for you.
- Very well, uncle Ivan.

112
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,500
Please, I already told you.
Comrade Strogov will not be here today.

113
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Come back tomorrow.

114
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,200
Bringing dogs to institution is prohibited!

115
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Pass this recipe, comrade Strogov.

116
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,600
Comrades!

117
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Our institution is going through
period of great tribulation.

118
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,300
The Vitosha's favourite,
Parmakov Stancho...

119
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,500
... is no more with us.
- Oh, when?

120
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,100
He's fired!

121
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh Lord, and I thought he passed away.

122
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Laugh at your own death!

123
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,700
How will you play without him?
And this is the final match!

124
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,000
The way we played and won before,
when he wasn't ours.

125
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,600
We will play without Parmakov.

126
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,400
Crazy people!

127
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Such jewels like Parmakov
create Bulgarian football.

128
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Can they destroy our football perhaps?
- So funny.

129
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,200
Parmakov is dead.

130
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,800
Long live Golubov!

131
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Scram! Scram!
May you choke with it!

132
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,900
Went out for a minute.

133
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,100
What was in the papers?
- The fate of Vitosha.

134
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,300
It was eaten by a dog.

135
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,400
Scandal! The fate of Vitosha
is in the stomach of some dog!

136
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,300
Who is this Golubov from Varna?

137
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,600
Golubov from Varna? Elena's friend.
And he was much better than Parmakov.

138
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,700
Where is Elena?

139
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,400
Dear Leni!

140
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,500
Dear Leni, at this moment
your personal happiness is decided.

141
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
He will be in Sofia.
You will have a good home,

142
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,300
and everything you need
for a sound marriage!

143
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,100
I don't understand a thing.

144
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,400
Zhenya told me about your Varna romance.

145
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,900
Sorry, but I'm strongly against this...
this sound marriage.

146
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,000
Dear Leni, even Tolstoy said:
"The end justifies the means".

147
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,100
We're facing the final match.

148
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,400
Therefore I immediately ask for
your Golubov's address and photo.

149
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,600
Yes, Tolstoy convinced me completely.
I haven't his photo or address,

150
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,800
I only know that he is an engineer at the
"Chaika" plant, and he plays for their team.

151
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Dear Lenya, my dear! You are unique!
- Yes I know.

152
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,600
Comrade Goncharova, now it's ten o'clock.

153
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,400
From now on, I'll promote you on the job.
- On State enterprise Vitosha's service!

154
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Ball?

155
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,100
<i>Golubov family</i>

156
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,300
Radoslav? Radosvet?
Get up!

157
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,000
You forgot something?
- Give me the jacket.

158
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Radosvet walked at night again.

159
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,700
Look at that, what a photomontage!

160
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,900
What do you have in common with
Yves Montand and Gina Lolobrigida?

161
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,100
Aren't you ashamed?

162
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,200
Listen, boy...

163
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,100
First, how could I be worse
than Yves Montand?

164
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I just do not sing. And secondly,
if Gina Lolobrigida would found out,

165
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
she wouldn't be angry, I suppose,

166
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,300
because she knows a lot
about male beauty.

167
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Thank you.

168
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,700
Bye.
- Bye.

169
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,500
<i>"I'm tired of waiting for the money

170
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,100
Mom, your son is not lucky.

171
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,400
What happened this time, Radoslav?

172
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,200
I fell in love with a girl from Sofia.
- And what's wrong with that?

173
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,200
I don't know how to find her.
- If you love her for real, you will find.

174
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,400
How did your father Kharalambi find me?

175
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm leaving for Sofia.
- Because of her?

176
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,500
Good.

177
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Well, 800 thousand metropolitan residents,
God forbid that.

178
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,800
You cut off men, children and grannies,
that's only about 300 thousands.

179
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,100
I have 6 days off, that means
some 50 thousand women a day.

180
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,600
You're so lucky, Radoslav!
And what if she lived in Moscow? Millions!

181
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye, Radoslav.

182
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,800
Beware of trams!

183
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Do not drink cold beer!

184
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,600
"I sued you"... "Kisses"!

185
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,100
The kiss of Juda.

186
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Mom!

187
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,800
Remember, life is roulette!

188
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,400
Who does not risk, does not win!

189
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Or loses.

190
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,700
Is this also roulette, son?

191
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,400
May I never win poker,
if these aren't judicial bodies.

192
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,000
What shall we do?
- Only over your dead body!

193
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,200
He is not guilty!
Only over my dead body!

194
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,400
Dead body!?
I do not know if he's guilty,

195
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,800
but we were sent here
because we terribly need him.

196
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,900
Please, call him, if he is at home.

197
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,100
I'm an unhappy widow,
I have a sick heart.

198
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,800
I will not survive this...

199
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,100
But he's not at home. Yes...
- It's a pity.

200
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,400
Rasho Chukov from the society
of culture and sport "Aggregate".

201
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,900
We'll wait for him, if you don't mind.

202
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,400
Gocho Polyansky from the
sport society "Gentian".

203
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,900
As you wish, but I don't know
whether he will return soon.

204
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,400
I advise you from the heart
to return to Ruse.

205
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,100
Why?
- Because your poor "Aggregate"

206
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,100
can not pay Golubov.
- Ah, well, you go to Plovdiv!

207
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,400
Why?
- Because your feeble "Gentian"

208
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,800
does not deserve such a player.

209
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,400
Are you still here?
- The funeral is postponed until tomorrow.

210
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,000
They are looking for brother.

211
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,100
What do you imagine?
Your Plovdiv is a real hole.

212
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,300
He's gonna be like a sausage
roasted in the high sun,

213
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,000
and then splashing around puddles
around the Maritsa river.

214
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And you want him to drown in the
turbid and dangerous Danube.

215
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,300
Or to be gobbled by the
evil mosquitoes of Ruse.

216
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,900
Besides, we offer him a solid salary.

217
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,800
How much, Gocho?
- Well, let's say 700, Rasho.

218
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,000
750!
- 770!

219
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,300
Well! It's good to be an athlete!
- 780!

220
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
790!

221
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,700
800!
- Wait, let me see...

222
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
805!

223
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
810!

224
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,000
815!
- Can not be!

225
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,000
820!
- Give me the suitcase!

226
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,000
Why do you need it?
- Give it, and don't ask!

227
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,700
Put it on the table.

228
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,300
827!
- Clean shirts!

229
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,300
Just a second...

230
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,500
Whose women are better -
In Ruse, or in Plovdiv?

231
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,800
If I'm not mistaken, Comrade Golubov.
Well, allow me... Do not worry.

232
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,600
I am a representative of "Gentian",
a solid sport society from Plovdiv.

233
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,800
I'm authorized for you to...
- Come to "Aggregate" from Ruse!

234
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,900
"Quiet, white Danube is worried!"
819 monthly!

235
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,200
So you are "Aggregate", you are "Gentian",
and I'm Golubov?

236
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,100
I understand, I sympathize, but not now.
Papa is a very strict person.

237
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,700
Therefore, in half an hour...
Check the clock.

238
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,300
On the Adam's beach.

239
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,600
Wonderful!
Only we do not have beach suits.

240
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,200
Bye.
- That's some bluffing!

241
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,700
But who is this?

242
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,400
Do not open.
Speak through the window.

243
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,800
<i>Who are you looking for, comrade?
- Radoslav Golubov.</i>

244
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,900
<i>And why do you need him?</i>

245
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,500
I want to make him a happy
and wealthy metropolitan.

246
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,100
Allow me to introduce myself: Vylo Volchanov,
a senior coach of Vitosha, from Sofia.

247
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,000
Nice to meet you.

248
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,300
Where can I see him?
- "Wait in the garden."

249
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,500
He'll be back soon.

250
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,800
Wait in the garden.
He will be back soon.

251
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,800
"I'll make you some coffee."
- I'll make you some coffee.

252
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,700
Please, please...
Do not worry, madam.

253
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Radosvet?

254
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,400
Horch? A solid brand.

255
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,200
Hot Sofia's greetings from Elena!

256
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,500
Ah, great!
And why does not she write !?

257
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,800
She doesn't write because she is waiting for you!
- Ah, I can not come...

258
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,500
Elena and I offer you a contract in Sofia.

259
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,200
Under what conditions?

260
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Apartment in the Oborishche Street,
the diplomatic quarter.

261
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,000
Registration in Sofia, the salary is 840.

262
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,900
850?
- Well, a little more...

263
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,600
I can not offer more, alas!

264
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,400
And who are you?
- I'm a senior coach

265
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,900
of "Vitosha", Vylo Volchanov,
known by the nickname 'Awl'.

266
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,400
A-ah! Documentation.

267
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,500
You are welcome...

268
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Hmm... Well...

269
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,300
I accept.
- Great!

270
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,600
When are we going?

271
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Kisses, Coco! Bye, Mom!

272
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,200
Madam, be proud that you are
a mother of such talent! Come on.

273
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,100
No, I'm not in the prison in Varna.
No, not in prison!

274
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,900
I wish you such a punishment.

275
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,300
Yes, people in Sofia are kind
and well-bred. They adore me!

276
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,700
They are fed five times a day.

277
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,200
They pay for housing...
No, everything is going fine.

278
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,400
What did you say about Radoslav?

279
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,300
Stayed at the hotel "Sevastopol"?

280
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,000
Are you sure?

281
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,900
Yeah... Just because!

282
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,900
No, I definitely need to talk with him.

283
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Bye, Mom!

284
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,500
You're pure gold, mistress.
Pure gold!

285
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,600
I've raised 12 children.
And they were all players like yourself.

286
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,700
Like myself?
- Like you. I've got the thirteenth.

287
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,100
I don't fancy that figure, mistress.
- Yes, do not look at the number.

288
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,000
You see the main thing is, that
the cat did not run across the road.

289
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,700
I remember one was brought from Kazanlak.
He played the right wing.

290
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,100
Another from Pavlikeni,
and the twelfth - Stancho Parmakov.

291
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,200
He was a centre forward,
and scored plenty of goals.

292
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,700
What do you play? - Poker, bridge.
Even the picket sometimes.

293
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,300
Dunno if you'd like here, boy.
- Why, madam?

294
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,500
In Sofia, we play W format.
Such is the strategy.

295
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,400
Congratulations on the position
of the referent.

296
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,800
And in just a few hours
you will be a resident of Sofia.

297
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,400
Vladko?
- I hear you.

298
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,400
This healing herb is like blood.
I feel so young.

299
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,100
Why don't you get married, Nikolay?

300
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,600
How should I put this, Vladko...
Our women in Sofia aren't feminine.

301
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,200
They walk in trousers,
they cut hairs like men...

302
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,400
How did our grandmothers
looked like in the past?

303
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,700
Oh, young man!

304
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,800
Hello!
- Hello.

305
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,200
I do not believe my eyes!

306
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,100
Have you already got married?
- Not yet.

307
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,300
Me neither.

308
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,900
At the station you said,
that you bring luck.

309
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,800
Ah, sure.

310
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,900
Here, look.
Chamomile instead of address!

311
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,900
Have you got the wallet?

312
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,300
Ah, yes, yes...

313
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,500
No no. This is new.
The old one went into the furnace.

314
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,200
800 thousand metropolitan residents.

315
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,800
Young man, do not leave.

316
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,800
And do not despair.
We will seek her together.

317
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,000
On the streets, in the gardens.
We'll go around apartments,

318
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,300
museums, theaters.
In the bazaar, on the beach...

319
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,200
And one day - we'll find her!
- Yes, yes!

320
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,500
And my dog, too.
Love will help you.

321
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,800
You will live in my bachelor apartment.

322
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,700
I raise toast in the honor of three bachelors!

323
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,600
Camomile or mint?

324
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,200
"The Karlovsk Misket"...

325
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Healing seaweed, eh?

326
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Cheers!

327
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,700
It seems that the matter is important.

328
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I called you to let you know,
that you, controller Goga,

329
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,000
and you, the case manager Peci...
- Me!

330
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,900
... are free from work for an
indefinite period of time

331
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,100
regarding the important public task.

332
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,300
Comrades! In our country there are people,

333
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,800
who cannot accept the success
of our dear "Vitosha".

334
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,900
And so they try to kidnap

335
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,000
our central striker Golubov,
who was found with such difficulty.

336
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,000
I assign you as his bodyguards.

337
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,100
Heroes! Before the final match
forget about everything, except Golubov.

338
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,200
Don't let him out of your sight.
Follow him like a shadow.

339
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Is that clear?
- It is.

340
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,200
Here are the portraits of competitors,
drew from memory.

341
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,600
This dumb guy is from Ruse,
and the crumpled one - from Plovdiv.

342
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,700
Remember how sheep were cut
in "Beautiful Elena"?

343
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,300
Where?

344
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,800
In the operetta, which we all went to.
- Ah, yes...

345
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,700
If he is kidnapped, then you are
being awaited the same.

346
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Can't be!

347
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,200
Wait! Wait.

348
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,500
Found. Write it down.

349
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Yes, write it down...
Today, on the 20th of this month,

350
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,700
he moved from cigarettes "Arda"
to "Diplomat".

351
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,700
How can you risk life for the
sake of some cigarette butts!

352
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,400
But this is your cigarette butt, comrade Golubov.
- Where are you going?

353
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,600
Return to the apartment.

354
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,800
Who is this suspicious old man?
- I'm not much older than you.

355
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,700
And I'm still a bachelor if you want to know.

356
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,100
As for Golubov's apartment,
he's going to live only with me.

357
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,200
Yes.
- You are ours! Hold it!

358
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,500
You are not normal!

359
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,900
Someone unhooked them.

360
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,800
It wasn't me. Those uncles did it.

361
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,100
Go back, follow the trolley!
- Golubov was kidnapped!

362
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,200
When?
- Now!

363
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,700
Haven't I forbade you to drink until Friday?
Look how dirty you are.

364
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,400
Go wash yourselves immediately,
and see the boss at 2 o'clock

365
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,000
for a small meeting.
Come on, come on.

366
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,400
SOFIA MINERAL BATH

367
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,800
Believe me, Goga, I would spend
whole my annual vacation...

368
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,600
all 20 days... here in the pool.

369
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Do you believe me?
- Why not?

370
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,900
Only, you know...
It's very humid air.

371
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,200
Now, if there were no roof, so that
sunshine could go through and warm up...

372
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,200
Ah, Peci...

373
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,600
Can you imagine how good it would be then?

374
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,000
Let me know, for this Golubov...
I'm ready to kill.

375
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,900
Dear Chukov, I'm not adherent
to physical violence.

376
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,500
But that highest of meanness, committed
for the sake of our own and our cities',

377
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,100
hardly deserves anything else.

378
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,800
Ruse will declare war on Sofia
because of this player!

379
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,800
Plovdiv will support you!
- Thank you.

380
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,500
And then we will play it by lot?
The lot, the lot...

381
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,800
Wow! Come on...

382
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,500
Rasho... It is forbidden to swim here.

383
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Stop diving if you are a man.
The enemy in the bath!

384
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,200
56 kilograms, Gocho!

385
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,300
And 140 grams, Rasho!

386
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,600
Yes, but with slippers on.
- Right.

387
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,100
And now?

388
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,500
This is another thing... Exactly.
- Same.

389
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,600
It is necessary to approach them closer.

390
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You will go to the vanguard,
and I'll stay in the rear guard.

391
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,900
Dumb guy from Ruse!
- Crumpled guy from Plovdiv!

392
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,300
We found them!
Come here, sweet...

393
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,400
I paid for a separate cabin!
- Quiet!

394
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,000
Go out, please!
Administrator!

395
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,600
Quietly, I beg of you.
Shhh, be quiet!

396
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,000
Let go of that man.

397
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,800
Please, excuse us,
It was absolutely coincidental.

398
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Comrade?

399
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,900
Hello! Hello!

400
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
God!

401
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,100
To die in a city bathhouse,
and at the hands of his favorites?

402
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,700
Nightmare!

403
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,600
Comrade boss, we are being watched.
- By who?

404
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,800
By those whom we follow.

405
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,900
What!?

406
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,200
Two provincial swindlers!
You want to leave us empty-handed again?

407
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,620
Funny!

408
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,800
Hey, you there!

409
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,100
Where did you hide Golubov?

410
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:24,700
What meanness! Where is your socialist,
sporting morale? Thieves!

411
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,500
And you?
What have you lost in Sofia?

412
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,600
Maybe you drove 500km just
to swim in our mineral bath?

413
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,500
We were the first to enter the yard,
and we defend our rights.

414
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,900
Take us to your boss,

415
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,000
so I'd tell him right in the face
that he was a lowly intriguer.

416
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,700
In this case, I invite you

417
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,900
for a small production meeting
in this modest cabin.

418
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,900
And who are you, anyway?
- I'm the boss!

419
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,100
I don't accept visits before dinner.
Tell'em I went to the ministry.

420
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,400
Comrades! I was in the balance!

421
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,300
<i>So, let's talk about Golubov frankly.</i>

422
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,100
Young man, we can proudly note

423
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,100
that we shaken these three
districts thoroughly...

424
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,300
Elena, in what area did you hide?
- I'm sure that in the first one.

425
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,000
Therefore I suggest the following route:

426
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,600
Let's walk by the yellow pavement
boulevard called "Russian".

427
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,500
Fine.
- Yes.

428
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, comrade Golubov! Victory!
- Everybody is waiting for you!

429
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,200
At last!
- Here he is!

430
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,600
Distinguished comrade Golubov,

431
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,000
Profkom did not organized
this small feast by accident.

432
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,200
A minute ago, you just got
your Sofia residence permit.

433
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,900
Now you're one of us!
Let's drink to the bottom.

434
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,500
You two, what do you want from me?

435
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,000
So that you don't jump from
the balcony into the trolley.

436
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,600
And that you don't throw
sticks of apples onto my head.

437
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,400
Who are you!?
- We are your shadow.

438
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,300
In our country, there are people
who want to kidnap you.

439
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,700
We guard you from enemies.

440
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,500
And which of you is Napoleon?
- Napoleon?

441
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,300
Who...

442
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Not me and not you.

443
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm telling you, it seems more appropriate
to go see comrade Strogov.

444
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,300
Yes?

445
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,300
Clear.

446
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,700
I'll be right back.

447
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Amateurs!

448
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,600
Aunt Penka, where are you going?
- I'll collect the cobwebs in the corridor.

449
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,100
What cobwebs in the corridor!?

450
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,300
Do you participate in amateur activities?
- I do, but who will clean?

451
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,800
In honor of the Sofia residence permit
and as a token of respect and gratitude

452
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,000
to our favorite Golubov,

453
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,700
our amateur ensemble will perform
a short literary and musical composition.

454
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,400
You will hear "Elegy of Football Patriots."

455
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,500
Text: Comrade superior Strogov.
Music: Neapolitan.

456
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,500
<i>Oh, my football!</i>

457
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,200
<i>Forever in us.</i>

458
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,600
<i>Advance!</i>

459
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,900
<i>... we give an advance (lost in advance).</i>

460
00:50:53,900 --> 00:51:00,800
<i>Our hearts languish only about you.</i>

461
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,200
<i>Oh, my football!</i>

462
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,300
<i>I am forever yours!</i>

463
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,600
Where are you going...
- What are you up to?

464
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
Physical education!

465
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:48,000
Well, I'm here. Maybe we will
continue this... party.

466
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,700
I expected a letter from you, Radoslav.
Or maybe you again saw off someone

467
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,500
on the coastal streets and squares?
- I didn't even look at single woman!

468
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,700
In Varna you were more romantic.

469
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,200
Let's move from away.
- But I ordered champagne!

470
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,900
How do you like it here?

471
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,400
Listen... Do not get carried away.
Night watch will be full of danger.

472
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,300
Do not be afraid! They're now
snoring in some station hotel.

473
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
What will you order?

474
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,200
Two mastikas.
- Large ones!

475
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
Why?

476
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,100
It's almost empty.
Only for a ticket to Plovdiv.

477
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,500
It's hard, dear Rasho, to fight
with large societies of Sofia.

478
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:22,500
So far we had the strength...
Tonight or never!

479
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,000
Is the rope with you?

480
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,700
Come on!

481
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,900
<i>There are some words superfluous to us</i>

482
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,800
<i>There are words hidden in our hearts</i>

483
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,700
Virginia, may I invite one
acquaintance for a dance?

484
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,600
Of course.

485
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,000
<i>... if your eyes have said everything.</i>

486
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,600
<i>Keep it quiet, keep it quiet</i>

487
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,900
<i>It is really in our eyes</i>

488
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,400
<i>There are no words waiting for you.</i>

489
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,900
<i>Keep it quiet, keep it quiet...</i>

490
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,600
Elena, I'm inviting you out on a date.

491
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,400
Tomorrow at 7pm near the fountain,
near the university.

492
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,700
My wife is going on a vacation
in Kostenets.

493
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,100
Do you have children, maestro?
- Three! But it does not matter.

494
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,300
I think that they will be
boring at the fountain.

495
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,800
Better go with them to the zoo
or in the puppet theater.

496
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,300
I didn't think you were a petty bourgeois.

497
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,500
I have great respect for you both
as a tenor and tennis player, but...

498
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,700
Meaning? No hope?

499
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Go to Kostenets.
- So heartless!

500
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Waiter!

501
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,900
<i>Speak, speak...</i>

502
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:02,100
<i>Even in silence we both
expect these words.</i>

503
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,300
Wait. Wait, they turned the corner.

504
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,900
Pec! Peci!

505
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,400
Peci? Pe...

506
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Good evening, Golubov.
You have offended the province

507
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,300
by agreeing to play in Sofia.

508
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,700
Leave the capital!

509
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,600
Choose yourself: "Aggregate" - Ruse,
or "Gentian" - Plovdiv!

510
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,400
Decide immediately!

511
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,500
Wow!

512
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,000
You see...

513
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,800
Ah, come on, go to sleep.

514
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,500
I have played and will only play
in my Varna's "Chaika", you see?

515
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:35,100
You're lying! Sly. You were
appointed as a referent in Vitosha.

516
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,600
But you will not play in the final match.

517
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,500
We, who suffered through, tell you this:
Chukov and Polyansky.

518
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,900
Comrades, this is some kind of misunderstanding.
- Just a minute.

519
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,000
Do you continue?
- Yes.

520
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,800
Tonight...
- ... or never!

521
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,900
Good.

522
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,500
Do not play an innocent nun.

523
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,900
Do not play an innocent nun.

524
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,300
Bye. Come again.

525
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,000
Katya, is my brother here?
- Yes, there he's at Pancho's.

526
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,000
When you finish, go straight home.
Mother is waiting for you.

527
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,300
But...
- Good. I know!

528
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,900
You're suffocating the citizens.
- Elena!

529
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:32,300
Finally... So much looking for
you and, suddenly, meet you here!

530
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,900
How are you, what are you doing?
- Do not make an idiot out of yourself.

531
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,900
Idiot!? Maybe I am, although
that is not too polite.

532
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,100
You tell me about politeness!?
So insolent!

533
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,300
Impudence - to love someone!?

534
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,800
Wash your head and sober up
after champagne!

535
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,900
What kind of champagne?

536
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,300
Hypocrite!
You will not deceive me anymore.

537
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,300
Do not be afraid. Consider
that we never met each other.

538
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:08,500
That's the same! We, women, always become
victims of low male instincts.

539
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,600
Now, tomorrow she will give birth -

540
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,900
to a boy or girl - who will
have no one to call a dad.

541
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,200
Your tears, colleague,
will not work for everyone.

542
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,000
If that's his child, then she
wouldn't have had to push him away.

543
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,000
It seems that the father is somebody else.

544
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,900
Farewell, Elena. I did not know
that you would be a mother.

545
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,100
Whose mother? What nonsense!

546
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,200
This is my twin brother.

547
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,500
Here! I told you that
I bring luck in love!

548
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,600
For violation of the rules of conduct
in the garden - a fine of three leva.

549
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,100
You are welcome.

550
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,200
25 levs!?
Are you laughing at me?

551
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,600
I've got no small change.

552
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,700
Then, keep kissing on for the rest.

553
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,500
Attention!
- Build!

554
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,600
Please, build!

555
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,100
On the right flank, faster!
- No talk in the ranks!

556
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,300
Comrades! Comrade superior Strogov

557
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,700
instructed me to tell you that
this is the decisive match!

558
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,900
Do not spare your strength!
Take an oath!

559
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,600
We're true to football!
- That's right!

560
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,500
Excellent.

561
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,700
The lunch break ended two hours ago!
- How long shall we wait?

562
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,500
Enough to confer.
- Vitosha is the champion!

563
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,600
Ah! There's nobody here!

564
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,900
Hallo? - Is that you, Comrade superior?
It's me, it's me, aunt Pena.

565
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:13,100
I'm listening. Nobody here.

566
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,200
It's full of people making noise, shouting...

567
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,700
They threaten to complain to the minister.

568
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,300
You're busy? What should I do?

569
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,900
Huh?

570
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,500
Yeah, take it somehow.

571
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,400
Well, okay... Ok, only they
all very evil, comrade boss.

572
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh well. Good.

573
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,100
Hey, come in, who's there in turn!

574
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,600
How are you, how are you?

575
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,400
Oh, grandmother Tinka, grandmother Tinka...

576
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,100
You'd better kill me,
than to suffer so much.

577
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,000
He committed fratricide!

578
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,100
Promised and did not come.
- Do not worry, dear. Will come tomorrow.

579
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,400
See you tomorrow...
Tomorrow will be too late.

580
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,000
Maybe you'll still feast at my wake.
Do you understand?

581
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,100
I guess...
- Guess, guess...

582
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,800
Have you ever played football?
- I've only seen others play.

583
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,400
Have you seen it?
- Well, of course, I have!

584
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,500
Come on, come here...
Stand here on the gate.

585
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,100
Do not move!
- I see!

586
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,900
What about the basin, son?
- It doesn't matter, granny.

587
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,000
Who saw a goalkeeper with the basin!?

588
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,700
I'm ready.
Will you beat the penalty?

589
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,900
So come on. Quickly, quickly!

590
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,300
I'm a beast!
- And I?

591
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:01,400
You, too... 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

592
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:08,100
Eleven! I learned bridge for a night,
and I can not play football, or what?

593
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,700
Oh!

594
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,500
Please, grandmother Tinka,
I beg you not to die!

595
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:27,000
Wow, you want too much!
I'm not old yet. Listen:

596
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,500
If you have to beat the penalty at the match,
hit it low, in the corner, son.

597
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,000
Do you understand?
- Oh, I understand, I understand...

598
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,100
They're coming!

599
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,800
Oh granny Tinka, what's wrong with him?
- How could I know. Here, we trained.

600
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,700
Maybe it's cancer?
- I cure cancer, too! Get up and no tricks.

601
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,600
Come on, go.

602
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,600
It's easy, man.
I know that you want a bigger salary!

603
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,800
You'll get it when we win.
- We did everything for you, man.

604
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,000
An apartment, a residence permit, salary.
Play the match!

605
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,200
Have you heard about Awl?
It's me.

606
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,800
You know what I'm capable of?
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!

607
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,100
I can not play without training,
postpone the match!

608
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,700
Will you get up, finally?

609
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,000
Are we going?
- Come on.

610
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,900
We'll start playing with ten men
until he's gone. But tough!

611
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,900
Have agreed?
- We agreed.

612
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,600
Instead of Golubov in the center - Nikolay.
- Good. Come on.

613
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,600
Vitosha! Vitosha!

614
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,200
Where is Golubov?
- Where's Golubov?

615
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,400
I'm his landlady.

616
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,900
What does he do at the gate?
- Yes, everything is clear.

617
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,100
Will play in defense, and in attack.

618
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,800
Peculiar tactics.

619
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:15,900
How are you feeling, eh?
- So good that we were avoided.

620
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:56,400
Siamese twins! Oh heavens, strike with
lightning the captive of yours, Vylo.

621
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,100
I will not survive this masquerade.

622
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,800
An ambulance!
- It's an emergency!

623
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,700
I'll forgive your brother
if you stay in Sofia.

624
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,500
Apartment on the street. Oborishche,
Salary - 1000 and stuff, stuff.

625
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,500
If you agree, you can start
playing in the second half.

626
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,200
Do you know...

627
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,400
I fell in love with the ball in Varna.
There I learned to play.

628
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,500
How can I leave everyone -
Friends, coach, fans...

629
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,800
Do not feel sorry for them. The way
they taught you, they will teach others.

630
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,500
Let them grow as footballers,
and we will take them,

631
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:37,000
we will provide them with conditions
for further development.

632
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,300
Unfortunately, you already invited my brother.

633
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,100
Do not despair, work with him.

634
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,000
As you can see, he's a clever fellow.

635
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:59,700
A sharp attack of appendicitis!
Call ambulance! I'm dying!

636
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,400
Where are you taking me?
Comrades, be careful what you do!

637
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,800
I do not want! I do not want!
I am the master of my body!

638
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,600
"Operating unit"
- But I'm alive and well!

639
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,900
Stop bullying!
- Anesthesia!

640
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,900
I'm dying like Jan Hus at the stake!

641
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,200
Misfire...

642
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,800
Tomorrow I will go to Pleven
and bring a real football player!

643
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,600
And there you stay, Vylo.

644
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,100
From this moment on, I'm firing you.

645
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:20,100
But they can not without me!
Is that so, my falcons?

646
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:36,300
In these moments of great sorrow

647
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,400
it's hard to hold back.

648
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,400
This favourite turned out to be fatal for us.

649
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,900
The thirteenth!

650
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,300
Comrade superior!
- What happened?

651
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:56,400
They're running behind me with documents,
comrade superior!

652
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:43,900
For breaking the rules, behavior in
the garden is fined with three leva.

653
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,500
Be alive and well.
Hold it!

654
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:53,400
You learned the rules poorly, granddad.
In the light of the moon, it's allowed.

655
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,700
Because this is a park, not museum.

656
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,600
The song I learned in your hometown.

657
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,500
I don't know how would it
sound without an orchestra.

658
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,300
The orchestra is here!

659
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,300
<i>There are some words superfluous to us</i>

660
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,400
<i>There are words hidden in our hearts...</i>

661
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,700
<i>Why should we say it loud,</i>

662
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:17,000
<i>if the eyes have said everything?</i>

663
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,500
<i>Keep it quiet, keep it quiet...</i>

664
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,900
<i>It is really in our eyes</i>

665
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,800
<i>There are no words waiting for you.</i>

666
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,000
<i>Keep it quiet, keep it quiet...</i>

667
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:48,700
<i>In the eyes it sounds all what
I feel together with you.</i>

668
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,700
<i>But sometimes even the eyes are silent,</i>

669
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,400
<i>if we stay alone under the stars.</i>

670
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,700
<i>Ah, then do not be silent!
Speak, speak</i>

671
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:10,200
<i>What our eyes did not say.</i>

672
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,200
<i>Speak, speak...
- Quiet!</i>

673
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,900
<i>There are even words...</i>

674
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:29,100
<i>Small words with great power</i>

675
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,800
<i>Speak, speak...</i>

676
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:41,900
<i>Even though we stopped,
we're both waiting for those words.</i>

677
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,200
THE END
