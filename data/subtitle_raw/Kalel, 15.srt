2
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,992
You're an embarrassment.

3
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,245
What will people say?

4
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,248
That I'm a bad mother,
and that's why this happened?

5
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,959
You shithead,

6
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,253
I send you to school.

7
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,381
It's all for nothing.

8
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,219
You can't smoke here, ma'am.

9
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,855
You better not tell your sister.

10
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,941
Her tongue is loose, like her vagina.

11
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,111
If you don't want the entire world
to knowâ€¦

12
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,115
don't tell anyone.

13
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,081
Laing.

14
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:01,222
-Pork blood stew, miss.
-Miss, what do you need?

15
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,562
Where have you been?

16
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,273
Don't start. I'm not in the mood.

17
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,613
I told you not to leave dirty dishes here.

18
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,072
Give me a break!

19
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,284
I only have two hands. I'm swamped.

20
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,626
Kalel, don't just stand there.

21
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,337
We have so much work to do.
Clear the table.

22
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,645
You're so tense.

23
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,690
-It's from too much work.
-Do you feel it? Right here.

24
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,948
It's the middle of the day,
and you're flirting with my friend.

25
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,117
Are you taking her seriously?

26
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,913
Just go back to your stall, Mameng.

27
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,832
They need those ingredients.

28
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,899
GOOD NIGHT, WORLD.

29
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,818
LET'S GO TO SLEEP.

30
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,601
Kalel, where's the blow dryer?

31
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,397
Hey!

32
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,066
What an ass.

33
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,115
Are you listening to me? Where is it?

34
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,533
How should I know?

35
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,077
-You were the last to use it!
-Was that necessary?

36
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,203
You're so careless!

37
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,747
You're the one with panties lying around!

38
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,749
You leave my panties out of this!

39
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,418
Stop this at once.

40
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,711
It's his fault.

41
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,588
Going somewhere?

42
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,509
Yes, I already told you.
Danny's going to pick me up.

43
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,468
Now?

44
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,594
Yes.

45
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,681
Mameng placed an order
for three kilos of spring rolls.

46
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,478
Just ask your boyfriend
to give us a hand here.

47
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,188
I can't!

48
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,982
-Such a slut.
-I said no.

49
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,525
You're an idiot.

50
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,486
You want me to hit you back?

51
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,572
What the fuck are you doing?

52
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,199
Show your sister some respect!

53
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,452
-She started it.
-Jerk.

54
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,455
What have I got to do with it?

55
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:43,880
It's our day off, but we're still working.

56
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,797
What?

57
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,424
I'm exhausted!

58
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,304
Excuse me. Do you think I enjoy this?

59
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:57,685
I am killing myself
just to feed the two of you!

60
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,481
You ungrateful wretch!

61
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,775
Stop being a slut!

62
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,820
There are better men out there.

63
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,034
All you do is have sex with Danny!

64
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,995
Do you use condoms?

65
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,790
Must I tell you everything I do?

66
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:25,004
Pardon me, madame,
but you can be a real idiot sometimes.

67
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,963
Fuck.

68
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,965
You might get pregnant again.

69
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,427
-Fuck this life!
-Life says fuck you too!

70
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,639
Come back here when you're dressed!

71
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,727
Did you tell her?

72
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,655
Sis.

73
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,615
Hurry.

74
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:54,992
Take this.

75
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,036
Ma, I'm leaving.

76
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,871
Go straight to school.

77
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,749
Here.

78
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,209
Text me.

79
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,740
Ms. Torres.

80
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,457
Please repeat what I said.

81
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,713
You're not listening.

82
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,548
Who are you texting?

83
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,562
Kalel, are you okay?
You seem a bit off today.

84
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,149
I'm just not feeling well.

85
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,153
Are you and Sue having problems?

86
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,323
No.

87
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,867
Why are you avoiding her, then?

88
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,370
She kept calling me yesterday,
asking if you were with me.

89
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,789
You haven't even fucked yet,
and you're breaking up?

90
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,462
Have you made out with her?

91
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,006
Make-out extreme!

92
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,635
I got to mash her boobs!

93
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,470
Did you check out her breasts?

94
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,096
Her nipples are pink, right?

95
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,349
Eloisa's are really dark,
like Oreo cookies.

96
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,809
They're as big as the original Oreos.

97
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,896
What's a guy to do? They're delicious.

98
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,927
She lost our bet. I won.

99
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,720
Here.

100
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,680
Hey!

101
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,682
Want some?

102
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,270
Come back here!

103
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,323
What's wrong?

104
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,366
Nothing.

105
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,704
Tell me.

106
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,625
You figure it out.

107
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,758
Your good night pic has 1,000 likes.
Who are these people?

108
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,845
My fans.

109
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,888
For real?

110
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,851
You can bid them good night,
but you can't send me a reply.

111
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,563
Why are you stalking me on FB?

112
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,982
Am I not allowed?

113
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,900
I thought I was your girl.

114
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,905
Look, I'm sorry.

115
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,284
I had to do a lot of errands for my mom.

116
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,370
-Can I have a kiss?
-Jerk.

117
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,705
It's just a kiss.

118
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,374
We're in our uniforms. Give me that.

119
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,419
Special trip, please.

120
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,339
Let me know when you're home safe.

121
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,519
LET'S JERK OFF TOGETHER.

122
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,783
IS THAT REALLY YOUR DICK?

123
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,577
WHAT'S YOUR ASL, BRO?

124
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,919
ARE YOU GAME?

125
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,474
Get up. Your father's downstairs.

126
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,853
Hurry. He can't stay long.

127
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,200
You finally found time.

128
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,245
I didn't have a choice.

129
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,997
Thanks.

130
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,917
You kept pestering my secretary.

131
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,638
Kalel, sit down.

132
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,561
What happened to you?

133
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,399
Only gay men end up with that.

134
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,443
Are you gay?

135
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,698
Where did you get it?

136
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,951
He won't answer.

137
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,996
I sounded like a broken record,
but I got nothing.

138
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,961
Where's that soup you made?
My stomach is aching.

139
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,381
You're done talking to him?

140
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,468
I'm hungry.

141
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,519
Did you let someone butt-fuck you?

142
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,630
Thanks.

143
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,391
It's hot.

144
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,587
Look, a sports car!

145
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,509
Isn't that Kalel's father?

146
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,887
Get inside!

147
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,408
Is that still a thing?

148
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,036
It used to be expensive.

149
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,414
You can get it for 4,000 in Manila.

150
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,338
-Kalel.
-Bro.

151
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,381
Your turn.

152
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,472
I want to go home.

153
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,725
Then, go.

154
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,858
Aren't you coming with us?

155
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,944
Caloy will text us if his dad leaves.

156
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,405
We already bought beer and munchies.

157
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,828
Do we have enough?

158
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,246
Yes.

159
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,128
One more.

160
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,547
Good stuff.

161
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,054
Just like a rock star.

162
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,491
Can I talk to him?

163
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,537
Bro.

164
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,251
Bring the lighter.

165
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,842
Are you sure you just want to talk?

166
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,863
What are we?

167
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,325
Humans.

168
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,244
Idiot.

169
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,915
Okay, we're idiots, then.

170
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,459
Be serious.

171
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,757
What I meant was,

172
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,927
are we just friends,

173
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,180
or more than that?

174
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,269
You want out?

175
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,189
Stop playing games. You're such a child.

176
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:21,196
So we're not humans nor idiots,
and I'm such a child. So, now what?

177
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,365
Stop it. Do we have a problem?

178
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,744
You can be sweet at times.

179
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,707
And then suddenly, cold and uncaring.

180
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,335
Earlier, you seemed to be
in your own world.

181
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,505
You were paying more attention
to that girl.

182
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,715
What was that?

183
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,969
You want my life to revolve around you?

184
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,346
I just want what we used to have.

185
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,644
I want to feel that I'm important to you.

186
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,985
You don't have to say it.

187
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,199
I know something has changed.

188
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,591
So?

189
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,264
You're just going to ignore me?

190
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,574
Ma.

191
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,369
-Where have you been?
-What are you doing?

192
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,996
We were working on a group project. Why?

193
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,668
I kept texting, but you never replied!

194
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,628
That phone is just a waste of money.

195
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,088
Just because I didn't reply

196
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,590
doesn't give you the right
to go through my things!

197
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,843
-They're mine.
-Where did you get these?

198
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,219
They're very expensive.

199
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,973
Are you using drugs?

200
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,226
Are you selling drugs?

201
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,063
What's going on? People are sleeping.

202
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,773
Mind your own business. Get out!

203
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,192
Fine!

204
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,075
Why are you doing this?

205
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,038
What did I ever do to you?

206
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,708
Stop being so dramatic.

207
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,794
Not everything is about you.

208
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,504
I'm the one with HIV!

209
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,673
Shut up. Someone might hear you!

210
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,719
Wait.

211
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,512
You have HIV?

212
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,351
I told you to mind your own business.

213
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,104
You're both shouting.
Of course I can hear you.

214
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,610
Shut your fucking mouth, you stupid twat.

215
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,155
If this gets out,
I will hang you upside down!

216
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,865
Why are you mad at me?

217
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,493
You're a gossip, that's why!

218
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,078
You gossiped about your own abortion.

219
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,190
Stop what you're doing.
Get your tuition money from your father.

220
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,484
Why me?

221
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,528
Who should go? Ruth?

222
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,530
He's not her father.

223
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,658
I don't want to.

224
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,201
What?

225
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,786
-I don't want to!
-Why?

226
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,581
What do you mean, why?
I don't want to go there.

227
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,874
-What's the reason?
-I just don't want to go.

228
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,627
Why don't you like going there?

229
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,173
You're lucky he's sending you
to a good school.

230
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,386
Be thankful that he was the one
who got me pregnant.

231
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:42,642
If it had been one of my other boyfriends
who were all assholes,

232
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,021
you wouldn't have gotten anything.

233
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,231
Believe me.

234
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,651
You were never lucky with men.

235
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,112
So why do you like Mon?

236
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,281
Yes.

237
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,116
Come on!

238
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,495
You bitch!

239
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,040
Bitch! You like it big.

240
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:32,233
<i>All we desire is your embrace</i>
<i>And forgiveness</i>

241
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:39,866
<i>Lord, our Father</i>

242
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:47,457
<i>Nothing compares to the joy</i>
<i>And love you bring</i>

243
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:58,593
<i>Lord, our Father</i>

244
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:16,111
Opel, get us a box of buns
and some orange juice, please.

245
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,362
We'll have snacks.

246
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,450
Excuse me. I'll get your food.

247
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,843
Give this to your mother.

248
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,470
How are you?

249
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,349
May I kiss your hand?

250
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,185
Please bless our son Enzo as well.

251
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,313
Enzo, let me hold him.

252
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,570
-Didn't I baptize him last month?
-Yes.

253
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,156
Oh my, he has grown.

254
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,075
Sorry, were you still talking
to your guest?

255
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,706
He's my friend's son. He just dropped by.

256
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,336
Father, I have to go.

257
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,380
-Mother's waiting.
-Aren't you going to eat?

258
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,425
I'm still full. Thank you.

259
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,762
Father, let's take a selfie.

260
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,096
All right.

261
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:47,952
Here.

262
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,247
What's this?

263
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,834
I read on the Internet

264
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,921
that it's a great help
to those with your illness.

265
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:02,258
Their viral level dropped because of it.

266
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,343
Google it.

267
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,230
Thanks.

268
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,926
Do you like it?

269
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,428
I'll give you a discount.

270
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,620
You can't stay long.

271
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,080
Why not?

272
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,458
I just got here.

273
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,753
Keep your voice down. They're sleeping.

274
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,486
Just go without me.

275
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,196
Take care, bro.

276
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,244
Are you still mad?

277
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,456
Are you free after class?

278
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,833
Can you come with me?

279
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,259
What did you want to show me?

280
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,928
Are you in a hurry?

281
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,972
My mom might get angry.

282
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,182
This won't take long.

283
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,947
Are you sure this is okay?

284
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,534
Yes. My parents are in the province.
They won't be back until tomorrow.

285
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,911
I'll get you a drink.

286
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,526
You sure have a lot of awards.

287
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,003
Have you counted all of them?

288
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,849
Wait.

289
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,475
Sue, what are you doing?

290
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,645
I realized why you were avoiding me.

291
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,814
-I haven't given in to you.
-Wait.

292
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,566
-It's okay.
-I'm leaving.

293
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,942
Just relax.

294
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,703
Sue.

295
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,128
Let's see if you can escape from this.

296
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,838
What's that?

297
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,465
Fuck, where did you get that?

298
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,050
I've always wanted to do this.

299
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,760
You have no idea.

300
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,268
You want this too, right?

301
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,539
What did you do?

302
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,749
You don't want this?

303
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,000
Are you crazy?

304
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,462
Fuck! Stop it!

305
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,257
Why did you bite my lip?

306
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,469
Kalel, wait.

307
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,932
Kalel, come back! You asshole!

308
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,424
Dinner's ready.

309
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,551
What's that?

310
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:25,886
Nothing.

311
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,557
Let me see. Why are you in cuffs?
Are you in trouble with the police?

312
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,312
What did you do?

313
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,856
You idiot. Did you kill someone?

314
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,234
You're so full of shit. Me, kill someone?

315
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,360
So what's with this?

316
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,278
It's nothing.

317
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,738
-Tell me.
-Nothing.

318
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,616
My friends were just fooling around.

319
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,091
Give me your hand.

320
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,441
Shit, Kalel,
I thought you were a good boy.

321
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,320
You really are my brother.

322
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,989
Let's go.

323
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,284
Come to the table
before the food gets cold.

324
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,248
Stack them properly.

325
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,292
This is heavy.

326
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,668
Just a minute.

327
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,090
Here.

328
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,343
After class, go straight to the eatery.

329
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,429
I have to go to the market,
so I need you there.

330
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,388
Okay.

331
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,474
It might spill.

332
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,809
Here.

333
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,603
Is that her?

334
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,397
-What?
-Is she your lover?

335
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,483
A lot of people
have already seen you with her!

336
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,652
Wait a minute.

337
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,529
You bitch!

338
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,949
Stop fucking my husband!

339
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,118
Fuck you! Don't you dare attack my mother!

340
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,829
Mon, you better fix this.

341
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,456
Let's go home!

342
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,292
Get inside!

343
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,628
Get inside, or I'll punch you!

344
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,506
You think you're so tough?

345
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,216
Bring it on, bitch!

346
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,761
That's enough.

347
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,680
Go home!

348
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,809
Leave, you piece of shit!

349
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,688
Fuck! Come back here!

350
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,565
Ma, he's not worth it.

351
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,774
Yes, let it go.

352
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,775
Idiots!

353
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,280
We loaded everything in the tricycle.
What am I supposed to cook in the eatery?

354
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,368
You should have unloaded it!

355
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,762
My father is looking for the handcuffs.

356
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,640
They're here.

357
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,351
Does he know what happened?

358
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,646
If he knew,
we wouldn't be talking right now.

359
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,315
He would have sent you to jail.

360
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,583
I'm sorry.

361
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,085
Sorry, my ass.

362
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,545
Wait, Sueâ€¦

363
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,306
Broâ€¦

364
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,185
are you and Sue still together?

365
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,482
We're just taking a break.

366
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,567
Are you sure?

367
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,654
Someone saw her at the Leopards party.

368
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:16,367
She was making out with a varsity player,
Balmaceda.

369
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:22,998
You didn't know?

370
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,085
You better investigate.

371
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,421
Sue could be playing with you.

372
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,548
Don't be a fool.

373
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,145
A witch?

374
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,942
She doesn't look like a witch.
More like a ghoul.

375
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,904
So early!

376
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,241
Sit, Kalel. Let's drink.

377
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,201
No, thanks. I have homework to do.

378
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,202
Busy?

379
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,164
Come on. Just this once.
You saw how embarrassed I was earlier.

380
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:08,294
Let's drink as equals.

381
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,879
Just call me Edith.

382
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,341
Let's get wasted, you motherfuckers.

383
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,177
Come. Sit. Drink.

384
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,015
You like getting drunk?

385
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,100
Okay, then.

386
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,185
Edith, can I ask you something?

387
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,770
Go!

388
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,858
Why do you have such bad taste in men?

389
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,860
You shithead!

390
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,695
They're all assholes.

391
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,196
You're such a sucker.

392
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,991
Don't be an ass.

393
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,618
I'm still your mother.

394
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,621
Don't make fun of my love life.

395
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,498
I thought we were drinking as equals.

396
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,255
Oh yeah. That's right.

397
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,468
But stop shitting on my parade.

398
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,013
My love life is my business.

399
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:04,642
Did I ever meddle in your love life?

400
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,477
Isn't your boyfriend a drug addict?

401
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,438
He's not an addict. He just has a vice.

402
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,775
So meth is just a vice now?

403
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,652
Fuck you.

404
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:20,407
-Who's the sick one here?
-Look at her, Mom.

405
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,408
So?

406
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,452
Let's be happy. Drink!

407
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:24,995
You're so arrogant.

408
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,996
Stop that.

409
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,624
You'll just end up fighting.

410
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,334
Let's just drink!

411
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,044
Drink up, asshole.

412
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,302
You are one horny motherfucker.

413
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,639
Not as horny as you, shithead.

414
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,141
-Fuck you.
-Aren't you going to ask her?

415
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,311
Never mind. Just leave her be.

416
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,610
If she wanted me to know,
she would have told me.

417
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,694
You're such a bitch.

418
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:02,324
She's already drunk.
Didn't she say we can ask her anything?

419
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,535
-You're so gullible.
-She might tell you.

420
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,995
-Don't bet on it.
-I'll ask her.

421
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,081
-Yeah, right.
-I'm going to ask her.

422
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,499
Edith, wake up!

423
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,752
Ruth wants to ask who her father is.

424
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,213
Fuck you. Stop it.

425
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,762
There must be a reason
why she's not telling me.

426
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,101
Your father is a priest,

427
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,938
and yet she told you.

428
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,899
So my father is probably worse.

429
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,987
Maybe he's a dog.

430
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,698
Fuck, maybe that's it.

431
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,741
Edith was fucked by a dog.

432
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,868
Shithead!

433
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,287
You look like a dog. Son of a bitch.

434
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,832
-Hit me, and I'll throw this at you.
-Fuck you.

435
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,250
You're an idiot.

436
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,404
Are you sure you're leaving your wife?
You might end up changing your mind.

437
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,949
Yes, I'm sure. And you?

438
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,577
Are you really leaving your kids?

439
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,163
Don't worry about them.

440
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,125
They're grown-ups anyway.

441
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,670
They can live on their own.

442
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,137
If you only knew how much I love you.

443
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,472
I love you too.

444
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,186
-Let's leave now.
-Kalel! You're still awake?

445
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,479
Where are you going?

446
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,899
I left a note at the altar
for you and Ruth.

447
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,025
Just read it.

448
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,613
I left money for the rent
and for the eatery.

449
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,281
Use the money wisely.

450
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,741
Why are you leaving?

451
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,539
Mon is leaving his family for me.

452
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,290
Fuck.

453
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,709
That's why you're abandoning us?

454
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,295
I'll be back.

455
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,047
When?

456
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,216
Fuck, Kalel.

457
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,720
You're old enough to understand.

458
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,014
You know everything I've been through.

459
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,644
He truly loves me
and is willing to fight for me.

460
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,063
It's time I give myself a chance.

461
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,732
We have to go before Osang tracks us.

462
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,859
Go back inside.

463
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:47,990
Take care of yourself and the eatery.
Otherwise, you won't have anything to eat.

464
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,517
You idiot. Why didn't you stop her?

465
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,936
Were you able to stop her before?

466
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,979
Fuck.

467
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,899
This is all Mon's fault.

468
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,567
Where is it?

469
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,235
-On the altar.
-Where?

470
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,278
The altar.

471
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,877
Shit! She beat me to it!

472
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,965
Danny and I were going to elope.
I'd already packed my bags.

473
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,968
Fuck!

474
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,022
Where's my allowance?

475
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,652
Here.

476
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,328
Here's more.

477
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:17,996
Are you sure?

478
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,623
Don't you want it?

479
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,717
It's taking so long. Maybe she went home.

480
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,469
Just wait.

481
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,888
Maybe they have a group project.

482
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:35,973
Group project?

483
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,225
We should have gone to her house.

484
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,398
Bro. Here she comes.

485
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,333
I told you, bro.
She's with that stupid Balmaceda now.

486
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,420
Dumb jock.

487
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,552
We weren't going to tell you,

488
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:18,724
but someone saw them in Twilight,
the motel near the market.

489
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,560
I have a discount card there.

490
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,564
Hey, Kalel.

491
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,027
Bro, sorry,

492
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,863
but we heard there's a video.

493
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:33,864
Is that true?

494
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,865
Yes.

495
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,660
It shows Balmaceda eating Sue's pussy.

496
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,203
Fuck!

497
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,247
Balmaceda is a jerk.

498
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,708
He was caught with a gun during a retreat.

499
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,667
Really?

500
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,253
Fuck, he should have been expelled.

501
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:54,384
You know, guys,
can we not talk about them?

502
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,011
We're drinking!

503
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,888
Let's just have fun!

504
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,431
Another round!

505
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,224
Let's order more?

506
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,603
But we have school tomorrowâ€¦

507
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,858
Kalel wants to drink! Let's party!

508
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,081
-What happened to your brother?
-Beats me.

509
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,459
Gross.

510
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,339
What a mess.

511
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,467
What a weakling.

512
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,928
He can't keep his liquor down.

513
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,933
Don't drink if you can't handle it.

514
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,561
Lights?

515
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,147
Get up! You have school today, right?

516
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,071
Clean up before you leave.

517
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,250
Is that my shirt?

518
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,795
I'm going to return it.
I haven't gone home.

519
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,922
You moron!

520
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,717
You're never going home.
He's staying with us.

521
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,012
Why?

522
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,097
Because I said so.

523
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,103
Go upstairs. You'll be late for school.

524
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,440
What a loser.

525
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,860
What an amateur.

526
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,322
So gross.

527
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,983
<i>Are you taking the medicine I gave you?</i>

528
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,902
It's so itchy.

529
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,281
Did you apply any ointment?

530
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,743
Just virgin coconut oil.

531
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,204
Did it help?

532
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,624
Not really.

533
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,422
I'll prescribe an ointment.

534
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:08,471
You need another blood test
to check your CD4 count and viral load.

535
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,480
We can only help you if you help yourself.

536
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,777
We arranged for counseling sessions,

537
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,238
but you and your mother never came.

538
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,089
If I kiss someone,

539
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,967
is it possible for her to be infected?

540
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,557
You can't transmit HIV with saliva

541
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:58,605
unless the patient's infected blood

542
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:03,902
comes in contact with an open cut
in his partner's mouth.

543
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,530
Even then, the risk is still small.

544
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,658
Why, did you kiss anyone recently?

545
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:19,000
What did I say?

546
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:24,047
You have to be honest
if you want me to help you.

547
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,476
She bit my lip, then she sucked my blood.

548
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:44,901
As I said, the risk is still low.

549
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:53,910
But it may be best
to have your partner tested.

550
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:02,961
Kalel, don't you have
any other activities to do?

551
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,331
Kalel, I need more plates.

552
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,771
Can I have my allowance?

553
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,149
What allowance? I'm broke.

554
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,610
How will I eat later?

555
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:11,738
Do you ever think about how we'll eat?

556
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,034
No money, but they have meth.

557
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:17,911
What did you say?

558
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,546
Fuck you!

559
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,714
You son of a bitch.

560
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,758
-Shut up!
-I use my own money for that.

561
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,636
Don't cuss my brother!
I don't ask for money from your sister.

562
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,679
-You should set him straight.
-Shut up!

563
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,976
Here.

564
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,853
That's all I have.

565
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,731
Borrow money from your classmates.
I'll pay them later.

566
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:48,816
Asshole.

567
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,568
Fuck you!

568
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,362
Get out of here!

569
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:56,658
How will you pay his classmates?
You sold everything!

570
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,035
Asshole! Did you not benefit from that?

571
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,829
Your brother is the asshole!
And he's sick!

572
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,958
-Don't mention that.
-I can hear you!

573
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,209
Fuck you!

574
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,461
Get the hell out of here!
This is our house!

575
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,967
Here. Now, get out of here!

576
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,134
Put him in his place!

577
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,887
Here, guys. Check these out.

578
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,224
They're in mint condition. Be careful.

579
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,102
Guys, I said be careful.

580
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,103
Come on. Buy it.

581
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,272
I'll get this. How much?

582
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:31,776
I bought that for 300 bucks.
I'll let you have it for a hundred.

583
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,819
Great!

584
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,449
Shit, Caloy. This is just 20.

585
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,993
That's all the money I have.

586
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,078
-You owe me 80.
-Fine.

587
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,371
Bro. I'll get this.

588
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,707
Yes!

589
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,251
This is your collection.
Why are you selling them?

590
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,130
I just have too many comics.

591
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,049
-Kalel, bro!
-I have no space for them at home.

592
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,217
Hey, Je.

593
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,385
So you haven't heard?

594
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,263
Sue has been absent for two weeks.

595
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,598
She's sick.

596
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,517
She was rushed to a hospital in Manila.

597
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,019
What's her illness?

598
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,730
She probably busted her pussy
from fucking Balmaceda.

599
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,025
Do you know what hospital she's in?

600
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,198
How much is this?

601
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,116
Those are 100 each.

602
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,993
Expensive. And the small ones?

603
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,119
Also 100 each.

604
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,329
Is there no discount?

605
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,456
Nothing's cheap nowadays.

606
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,821
Miss, where can I find Sue Evangelista?

607
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,199
She's in room 804.

608
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:46,577
-804. Here?
-Upstairs.

609
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,798
Is that for me?

610
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,569
It's good you came to see me.

611
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,781
I'm so bored. I have no one to talk to.

612
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,037
Where are your parents?

613
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,956
They'll be here after work.

614
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,683
What's your illness?

615
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,062
Just a fever,

616
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,731
but it got worse.

617
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,026
I'm okay now.

618
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,530
Why?

619
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,075
Did you miss me?

620
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,832
Don't worry.
I'll be back in school next week.

621
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,379
Come closer.

622
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,062
Are we back together?

623
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,191
I thought you didn't like me anymore?

624
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,361
I can like you again.

625
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,865
What about your boyfriend?

626
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,992
What boyfriend?

627
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,745
You're the only one who came to see me.

628
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,041
You even brought me an apple.

629
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,461
So we're back together.

630
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,343
Come closer.

631
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,397
I miss you too.

632
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:15,953
I want to kiss you, but it's not allowed.

633
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,040
I might infect you.

634
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,214
Did you miss me?

635
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,678
Of course. Don't you believe me?

636
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,955
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

637
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:21,120
Have some water.

638
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,129
Bro, your girlfriend's so high.

639
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,965
Jerk. Stay away.

640
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,342
Get lost.

641
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:39,972
Relax.

642
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,855
We should just enjoy ourselves.

643
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,195
You're back together?

644
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,204
What about Balmaceda?

645
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,708
Maybe they were just fuck buddies.

646
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,668
No.

647
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:17,218
Sue's raunchyâ€¦

648
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,348
even though she looks
like the Virgin Mary.

649
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,225
Show some respect.

650
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,729
What's your problem?

651
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,524
What's that smell? You're all too young!

652
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,527
Stay out of this.
We don't mind you doing drugs downstairs.

653
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,698
You're too serious.

654
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,410
I come bearing gifts.

655
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,163
-What's that?
-Open your mouth.

656
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,998
-What?
-Open!

657
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,625
Asshole!

658
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,963
Body of Christ.

659
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:55,673
Fuck, Danny.

660
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,885
You, open your mouths!

661
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,846
Wait, won't we get arrested for this?

662
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:03,889
Idiot!

663
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,559
Only people who live in slums
get arrested.

664
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:08,102
What?

665
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:10,354
Stop asking questions. Open!

666
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,274
You're next.

667
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:14,316
No.

668
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,320
Here!

669
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,782
You, Tiny. Come here.

670
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:24,743
Tiny, you'll get two.

671
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,790
Is this it? I don't feel anything.

672
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,625
Just enjoy it!

673
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,736
This is beautiful.

674
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,407
It's a different world.

675
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,863
He keeps saying
that he will stop gambling.

676
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:49,995
But as soon as he has money,
he heads straight to the casino.

677
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:57,544
He even steals money from my piggy bank.

678
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,675
One morning, we woke up

679
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,721
to find the TV gone. He had pawned it.

680
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,351
The other day,

681
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,229
they almost killed each other.

682
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:21,110
My brother cut his hand
trying to stop them.

683
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,322
Fuckâ€¦

684
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,826
I wish they would just split up.

685
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,620
I'm tired of them.

686
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,128
I have HIV.

687
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:48,929
You have AIDS?

688
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:53,225
You're so stupid. He said HIV.

689
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,893
How am I stupid?

690
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,312
Pipe down, you two.

691
01:11:56,395 --> 01:12:00,357
I didn't tell you right away
because you might find me repulsive.

692
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,694
You might start avoiding me.

693
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:08,282
You're being silly. We're like brothers.

694
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,286
Even when we grow old,
we will still be there for each other.

695
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:15,039
That's why we call each other "bro."

696
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,123
That's right.

697
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,875
We're like a family.

698
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,421
We share everything.

699
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,009
If one of us has a problem,
it's everyone's problem.

700
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,262
No one gets left behind.

701
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,474
Guys,

702
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:38,604
make sure this doesn't get out.
Promise me.

703
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:40,939
Of course.

704
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:01,710
Coach.

705
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,422
You should try out for varsity.
You have what it takes.

706
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,592
Okay, Coach. Thanks!

707
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:13,806
Guys!

708
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,644
Coach told me to try out for varsity.

709
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,729
You guys should try out too.

710
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,775
Can I have a drink?

711
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:32,282
-Here.
-I'm not thirsty.

712
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,036
Let's go.

713
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,496
We have to go, bro.

714
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,040
We'll just see you later.
I'll send you a text.

715
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:47,464
And congrats!

716
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:06,733
Sue.

717
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:10,696
Hey, are you okay now?

718
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:13,198
Is it true?

719
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,867
Do you have AIDS?

720
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,000
Who told you?

721
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:26,253
A lot of people. All our friends know.

722
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,762
I have HIV. I don't have AIDS.

723
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:36,889
That's the same.

724
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,015
No.

725
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,478
I'm not sick.

726
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:44,605
Not yet.

727
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:47,608
What about me?

728
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:50,694
Won't I get infected?

729
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,200
It doesn't work that way.

730
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,410
Are you sure?

731
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,539
Even if I bit your lip?

732
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,295
Maybe that's why
it took me so long to shake off my flu?

733
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,513
The doctor said the risk
of infection is low.

734
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,768
But if you want to be certain,
we can have you tested.

735
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,561
Fuck, Kalel!

736
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,066
What if I also infected someone?

737
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:08,897
Jerk!

738
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,401
What's going on?

739
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:14,236
-I said, stop!
-Why?

740
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:16,863
Enough!

741
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:19,533
Stop!

742
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,286
He started it.

743
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:24,830
What? What's your problem?

744
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:39,928
What possessed you to spread rumors
that your classmate has AIDS?

745
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,639
It's not just me, Sister.

746
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,391
But you started it.

747
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:48,061
If I were Mr. Fernandez,

748
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,397
I would probably punch you too.

749
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,191
That's slander!

750
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,236
Why don't you ask him if it's true?

751
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,655
Is it true?

752
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:02,492
Idiot.

753
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:05,287
Get out.

754
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,293
You too, Miss Consolacion.

755
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:12,461
But, Sister,

756
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,630
there's talk among our students

757
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:21,178
that he might have infected
his girlfriend.

758
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,639
She's also a student here.

759
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:25,932
Infected?

760
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:29,895
Why?

761
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,357
Are you and your girlfriend having sex?

762
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,404
I don't understand.

763
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,075
Why is this happening here?

764
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,785
This is a Catholic school!

765
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,710
Did you get tested?

766
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,303
Don't.

767
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,388
Fuck you!

768
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,847
-Is that him?
-Leave him be.

769
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,557
Stop here.

770
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,126
Sis?

771
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,804
There was a commotion earlier.

772
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:52,764
What happened?

773
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:56,601
Your landlady came earlier
with village officials.

774
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,645
They told your sister to leave

775
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:01,064
because you were several months
behind in rent.

776
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,276
But your sister put up a fight.

777
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,320
Even her boyfriend beat them up.

778
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,322
The landlady punched your sister.

779
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:35,891
Is there a Ruth Anne Fernandez here?

780
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,143
This is the traffic bureau.

781
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,269
Try next door.

782
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,438
Thanks.

783
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:35,283
Is there a Ruth Anne Fernandez here?

784
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:37,535
Ruth Anne Fernandez?

785
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,542
She was brought in earlier.

786
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:45,543
Just today, right?

787
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,003
Ruth Anne Fernandez.

788
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,547
Sir.

789
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,257
Thanks.

790
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:54,094
Put it inside. I'll eat later.

791
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:55,720
Thanks.

792
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,056
What's her name again?

793
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,976
Ruth Anne Fernandezâ€¦

794
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,439
Here it is. Ruth Anne Fernandez.

795
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,610
But she's in no condition to talk.
Come back tomorrow.

796
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,821
Why? She's my sister.

797
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,448
She was high on drugs
when she was brought in.

798
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:17,409
That's probably why she was violent.

799
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,081
Will she be released tomorrow?

800
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:27,127
Tomorrow's Saturday.
You can post bail on Monday.

801
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,169
Bail?

802
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,172
How much would that be?

803
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,591
I don't know.

804
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,678
Come back tomorrow with your parents.

805
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:39,597
Let them take care of it.

806
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,018
Sir, is it possible--

807
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,562
Come back tomorrow.

808
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:49,858
Bring your parents with you
so they can take care of things.

809
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:28,357
May I talk to Father?

810
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:32,570
He's inside the confessional.

811
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,366
What time will he be done?

812
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:41,412
It depends. If there's a long line
of people who want to confess,

813
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,997
he just stays inside.

814
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,501
Father, it's Kalel.

815
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:49,855
Where's Father George?

816
01:32:50,856 --> 01:32:54,860
He is sick. I am filling in for him.

817
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:10,918
I need to speak with him.

818
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:12,795
About what?

819
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,724
I need to talk to him.

820
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,769
Come back some other day.

821
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:33,608
Please, child.
There's a long line outside.

822
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:46,162
You should go.

823
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:16,317
I'm his son.

824
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,503
I have nowhere else to go.

825
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:02,863
Kalel is here.

826
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,086
Sit down.

827
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:26,095
Are you hungry?

828
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,811
You can have it. I have no appetite.

829
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:48,617
Eat slowly. You might choke.

830
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,176
Fuck this arthritis.

831
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:19,064
That's how I eat meat too.

832
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,525
I slice the fat off.

833
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:26,655
Why are you here?

834
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:32,077
We were evicted.
We haven't been able to pay our rent.

835
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:36,040
Where's your mother?

836
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,339
She ran off with her boyfriend.

837
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,593
My sister is in jail.

838
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:51,096
The police said perhaps tomorrow--

839
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,599
How much do you owe?

840
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:00,397
Rent is 8,000 a month,

841
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,943
but we haven't paid for five months.

842
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,949
My bones are so painful.

843
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:15,621
There's an envelope near the TV. Get it.

844
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,386
How much is in there?

845
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,570
Give that to your landlady for now.

846
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,283
Next week, come back here.

847
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,202
We will pay the full amount.

848
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,544
I need to post bail for my sister.

849
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:09,592
Kalel, your sister
is not my responsibility.

850
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:10,926
She's not my child.

851
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:14,221
What's important is for you
to get your home back.

852
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,061
I don't want to live there anymore.

853
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:23,898
Where will you go?

854
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:33,365
You can't stay here.

855
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,394
I thought you weren't coming.

856
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,771
Would you like to eat first?

857
01:39:46,772 --> 01:39:47,815
I'm not hungry.

858
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:53,278
I've been sending you messages.
It's good to finally get your attention.

859
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:56,323
Are you really up for this?

860
01:39:57,908 --> 01:39:59,410
Just stick to our agreement.

861
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:01,412
Of course.

862
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:04,331
Is Kalel your real name?

863
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:09,003
Aren't we gonna leave now?

864
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,296
I'll just finish my coffee.

865
01:40:12,881 --> 01:40:14,591
I'll wait for you outside.
