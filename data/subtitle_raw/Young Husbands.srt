1
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,741
- Hey, blondie, got a cigarette?
- No. - Giulio? Come!

2
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:58,461
- Leave him alone, can't you see
he's innocent? - Bye!

3
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:01,256
He still has to put some meat on
his bones..

4
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:06,765
- He's under age! - Hi! - Caroline
Cherie! - Take him to his mother!

5
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:10,196
Giulio, when we were your age, I and your
brother got in with uncle's ratio card.

6
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,233
Come on!

7
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,222
Come on, boys!
All together, go!

8
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:22,212
One... One, two, three!
Go!

9
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,769
I had you all!

10
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:28,088
How happy we were.

11
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:32,119
Happy to be twenty,
happy to enjoy those summer nights,

12
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,721
and above all,
happy to be together.

13
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:38,429
Ours was the most beautiful pack
in the city.

14
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:41,983
My brother, Giulio, the innocent.

15
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,616
Ettore, the women's idol.

16
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,886
Marcello, last in races,
first in love.

17
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,001
Franco, the craziest, merriest
and happiest of us all.

18
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:53,719
And I.

19
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:58,353
Boys, I 'm not sleepy, I wanna have
fun! Roars the lion!

20
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:02,066
- Where should we go? - The bar at the
station, there's where women are. - Yes.

21
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,062
- Home you go. - You go.
- Don't you see he's still a suckling.

22
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,408
Suckling my ass!
Let's find him a woman.

23
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,411
- Think I can't find my own women?
- Move it!

24
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:15,598
- We'll get you one! - I'll kick your ass
if you don't! - What's he gonna do with her?

25
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:23,382
- No!
- More, more, more!

26
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:25,384
Go!

27
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,578
I want to have fun, guys,
I'm not going home tonight!

28
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,049
- Don't be afraid, Giulio, we'll
find you too a woman tonight. - Who?

29
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,205
- The fatty!
- Let's go to fatty!

30
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:38,316
Hurrah!

31
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,329
- Ops! - Fatty? - Eh,
fatty... - No fatty!

32
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,079
- Nothing, nothing! - Come on!
- Pull! - Come one, come on!

33
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,081
And the bottle?

34
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:03,311
Another bottle.

35
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:06,821
- Come on! - Now you'll go home?
- Yes, tomorrow! - Balls, balls!

36
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,857
Hey, spanish cows, I'm drinking!

37
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,406
Disgusting!

38
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,327
It's venom, but...

39
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:24,671
- Hey, guys, who's goin' to pay?
- I've also won!

40
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:28,784
You've ruined me! Bastards!

41
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,970
- Franco! He's leaving.
- Where're you goin'? - Franco!

42
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:41,885
- Franco!
- Where're you goin', Franco? - Franco!

43
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,544
And a one!

44
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:56,373
Two... and a three!

45
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:07,398
- Spanish cows! Jump, if you got balls!
- Here we are!

46
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,220
Who'd have ever thought that in a
few days one of us...

47
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:13,463
.. was to get married?

48
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:17,096
Our seemingly endless way of life
was to be changed,...

49
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:21,411
.. as our friendship and youth
would be.

50
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,162
Come!

51
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,835
Come on, Marcello,
we 'll all get drowned!

52
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:33,859
Hey, sirens! Let's go!

53
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,816
And we, the sons that were,
we drank, drank...

54
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:41,247
Hey, help, they're stealing my
underwear!

55
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,285
- Help!
- Hey!

56
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:49,954
Hey, you! Hey!

57
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,462
Franco? Hey, Franco!

58
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:05,452
Hey, guys, Franco can't make it out.
Franco! Franco!

59
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:13,230
- Imbecile! - Stupid
- Look at what he does!

60
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:15,185
Moron!

61
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,937
This water gets you drunk!

62
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:31,396
- Ah, how I'd like getting married!
- Shut up, suckling!

63
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,795
We're drunk again!

64
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:40,737
"Guido, I'd wish that you, Lapo and I
were bewitched away... "

65
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:43,250
".. and put in a vessel
that all winds... "

66
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,016
Long live freedom! Ole!

67
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:49,282
I'm going up!
Up and up!

68
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:52,761
Hey, guys, I'm flying!

69
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,108
Good evening, good...

70
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,423
I don't want to sing anymore!

71
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:08,488
- You don't want to sing? Hey?
Answer! - No.

72
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:12,997
- You're crying because they've taken
your underwear? - No, no.

73
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:17,113
- I know why you're crying.
- Why?

74
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,226
- Because I went with Maria on Sunday.
- No.

75
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:25,100
In fact, I took Maria away from you on
Sunday, as I did with all the others.

76
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,938
Ah, yes? And then,
why are you crying?

77
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:32,088
Boh, how should I know?

78
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,040
Here, put this on.

79
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,105
You are for me...

80
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:44,539
Oh, hear the music?
Antonio, the music!

81
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,303
.. the fairest in the world,

82
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:51,454
and a deep love...

83
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:55,119
.. ties me to you!

84
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,158
Antonio, the music! Let's go!

85
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:06,028
A sweet babe to me you are,
heavenly spring...

86
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,862
- Hi, guys!
- Hi! - Hi.

87
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,811
.. for the sake of my love!

88
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,242
- No, no, wait, wait!
Guys, where're you going? - Home.

89
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,562
- No, let's have a drink at Dente.
- It's closed now.

90
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:22,353
- We'll drag him out of bed. - But we
haven't got any money. - I'm paying.

91
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,590
- I'll buy you all one. - If he's paying,
then fine! - Lucky me!

92
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,074
Hey, wake up inside!

93
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:47,186
- Hey, Dente!
- Dente!

94
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:54,289
- Is Dente at home? - He's sleeping. - Hey,
guys, let's drag him out of bed.

95
00:08:56,776 --> 00:09:00,444
- Hey, Dente, wake up! - What happened?
- What is it?

96
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:04,316
- We want an omelette.
- With how many eggs? - 100 eggs!

97
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,270
Music!

98
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:08,748
Let's show them how you
dance merengue.

99
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:37,696
- We're on Biscione street.
- Guys, shall we go once again?

100
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,486
- Come on!
- Let's go!

101
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:43,124
Roars the lion!

102
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:51,346
Come on, guys!

103
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:54,779
- Ma'am! - Ma'am!
- Here we are! - Open up!

104
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,814
- Ma'am, we want to talk to you!
- Just a sec!

105
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,325
What do you want? Go away!
Want to wake-up the whole street?

106
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:06,565
Go away! Go away!
Go back to bed, snotties!

107
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,480
Snotties!

108
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:25,686
Down with women!

109
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,796
We don't give a damn!

110
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,132
- Happy you, Donatella, getting
married. - Careful! - Are you crazy?

111
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,691
Donatella, how do you feel?

112
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:48,279
Happy, Lauretta.
So happy I could die!

113
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,202
Wow! You've even got a transparent
nightgown, Donatella!

114
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:56,308
- Have you seen? - When will it
happen to me also? - Boh!

115
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,263
I'll help you with the panties.

116
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:01,661
- That'll make me the first of your
friends to get married. - She promissed me.

117
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:04,419
Moron! You'll die an old maid.

118
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,845
Come on, don't fiddle, it's late!

119
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:10,961
I've chosen you two to make Donatella's
wedding night bed.

120
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:13,279
Let's go, come with me.

121
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:17,909
- Donatella, we're off making your
bed, understand? -Let's go, Ornella.

122
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:22,066
Poor mother. She thinks Ornella and
Laura have never kissed a man.

123
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:29,890
- Say, do you know how to make a bed?
- You'll see what a mess!

124
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,715
How'd you like your husband?

125
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:43,498
Catch it.

126
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:46,816
Cute, like Franco?

127
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:48,974
Serious, like Marcello?

128
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:52,685
Intelligent, like Antonio?

129
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:58,636
Or handsome, like Ettore?

130
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:03,621
Handsome, like Ettore.

131
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,773
Just imagine what a couple I and Ettore
would make!

132
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:23,344
- It's late, we have to go.
- Yes, let's hurry up.

133
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,539
Congratulations to
the married couple!

134
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,820
- Here she is... our baby.
- Baby my foot!

135
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:48,525
We, the Marchetti, at 23 years
we're full-fledged men.

136
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,669
I'm not serene, I'm not.
It's like I was afraid.

137
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:57,161
- Afraid of what? - He's not like you,
nor is he like your father.

138
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,109
We've always spoilt him,
we've given him everything.

139
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:03,418
He knows nothing about life,
he's always been pampered.

140
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:07,403
Words! The chip doesn't fall far.

141
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:14,321
But he's so young,
so unprepaired.

142
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:09,119
It feels like it's only yesterday that
I baptized you.

143
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:17,174
Say, Big Eyes,
would you be scared?

144
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,912
I would.

145
00:14:24,435 --> 00:14:26,101
I wouldn't.

146
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:33,480
Franco Marchetti, will you take Donatella
Nicolai for your lawful wedded wife...

147
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:37,426
.. according to the rite of our
Holy Mother, the Catholic Church?

148
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:38,900
Yes.

149
00:14:40,742 --> 00:14:42,726
Bye!

150
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:50,979
Goodbye!

151
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:54,214
- Goodbye to all of you, guys.
- Goodbye.

152
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:57,159
- Are you nervous?
- A little. How time flies by!

153
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:59,712
- She duped him. Think they'll be happy?
- Yes.

154
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:04,735
- Are you going straight home? - Yes.
- We're in the mood for some fun!

155
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:09,079
- Honey! - Happy you. Bye.
Let's go. - Bye.

156
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,953
- Can you imagine Franco tonight?
- Sst! You don't say that.

157
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:16,816
He'll have to tell us everything when
he gets back!

158
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,642
Franco's honeymoon was an unusually
long one.

159
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:30,902
In the meantime we indulged in our
favorite hobby: women.

160
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,732
I'm ready.

161
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,645
It was a Sunday, and my brother
Giulio seemed kind of strange to me.

162
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,189
There was something hatching in his
body for a long time.

163
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:47,047
It looked like if he was not getting
ready for the Mass, but for the Quirinale.

164
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,984
What are you waiting for
to get dressed?

165
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:58,843
- Antonio.
- Stop it!

166
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:06,299
- Say, whose is that shirt?
- Yours. - Take it off right now. - No.

167
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,515
- Come, get the shirt off.
- I can't, I need it today.

168
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,869
Listen, when will you stop from getting
under my feet?

169
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,263
When is it going to get into your skull
that you must do what I tell you to? Well?

170
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,857
- Come, take the shirt off.
- No! - Come on!

171
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,846
It's useless, I've got to
speak to Laura today.

172
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:25,118
Day-dreamer.

173
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:36,677
What do you think,
are plans useful?

174
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:44,848
- Not to me, I'm too candid.
- Only men are always good at it.

175
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,883
These scoundrels...

176
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:50,722
Anyway, when he comes,
I won't even look at him.

177
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:53,208
As if he doesn't even exist.

178
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:58,253
You'll tell me everything he does:
where he sits, who's he looking at...

179
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:02,418
- And then nothing, I just follow the Mass.
- And then?

180
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,455
Then, at the Club it's a different story.
I'll drink two Martinis and...

181
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:11,181
- What will you do?
- I think I'll slap him.

182
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:14,424
What has he got that you like
him so much?

183
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:17,347
He's handsome... he's handsome.

184
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:22,267
Here he is,
this Apollo del Belvedere..

185
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:24,223
Have a good Sunday.

186
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:33,870
- Ettore.
- Hi.

187
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,836
I've found a job. A great one,
it's almost for sure.

188
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:42,956
- Work is exhausting. - It's the
most beautiful thing in the world.

189
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:48,316
- Hi, Marcello.
- Hi, Laura.

190
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:55,969
Do you see these ones here? Ready to fall
into your lap like pears.

191
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,765
It's too easy, I'm bored with it.

192
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:07,331
If I may. Sorry.

193
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:09,297
Hi.

194
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,172
- Hi, Laura.
- Ssst!

195
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,381
Who's the one in the back?

196
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:23,825
Didn't you say you were bored?

197
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,987
- Good morning.
- Hi.

198
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:39,904
Antonio, you know the job at Montecatini?
Well, it's mine.

199
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:44,907
Ah, at last. Now you'll be pleased.
I'm happy for you.

200
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:55,597
Hi.

201
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,879
Hi.

202
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,403
What's on?

203
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:13,768
You know what I say to you?
Deep down, Ornella is nice.

204
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:16,125
Ite, missa est.

205
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:43,292
- We, men, are blind. - You want charity?
- No, I'm not joking, Ornella.

206
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,843
Then it's even worse,
I should be careful.

207
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,993
You know I'm kind of mad,
don't you?

208
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:51,774
Well, I set it for myself
to find the ideal woman.

209
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,760
- That's what you tell them all.
- It's true... but where's the pleasure?

210
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,465
There is, there is...

211
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:01,492
- Hi, Ettore.
- Hi. - Hi, Mariline.

212
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,986
Lucky you who don't like women.

213
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,160
- Hi, Laura.
- Hi. - Hi, Giulio.

214
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,934
Who were those that have
greated Ettore?

215
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:20,953
- Mh! Sucklings.
- Your school mates?

216
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:25,654
- Laura, is it me, or we dind't say
hello this morning? - Hi. - Hi.

217
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,442
You've made your mind, finally...

218
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,128
Here we are, granny, let's get down.

219
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,939
- Eh, the billioness has arrived.
- A beauty.

220
00:20:57,982 --> 00:21:00,642
- Who, she, or the car?
- She.

221
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:24,331
You, guys, go out with us, either
'cause we're rich, or beautiful.

222
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:26,435
Never for more serious reasons.

223
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,907
You're rich and beautiful
and, still, I had never looked at you.

224
00:21:31,262 --> 00:21:33,766
No, I don't think I'll make it.

225
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,826
Yes, bye. Alright.

226
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,635
Bye, see you later.

227
00:21:57,657 --> 00:21:59,920
Livio, another Martini.

228
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:04,697
What a life life: Mass and Club,
Club and guesthouse Azzurra.

229
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:07,720
Always the same muggs.

230
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:10,224
Always the same words.

231
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:13,617
And always the same 1,000 lire
in my pockets.

232
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:17,757
Happy her, coming into the provinces
only three days a year to see her granny.

233
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:23,844
Is it possible nobody knows her?

234
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,617
- I don't like her.
- You don't understand anything.

235
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:36,939
- Nothing at all. - Ettore, finish it,
I'm already a little hammered.

236
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:42,160
- Oh! Giulio, I'm sorry.
- How unlucky.

237
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:49,166
- I'm going into the garden. Coming?
- Yes.

238
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,802
Another one?

239
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:04,693
- Little wife?
- Mm... - Eh?

240
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:17,395
- How many times did you come here
with a girl? - Many.

241
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:21,851
- And where did you take them?
- Down there, behind the bushes.

242
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:25,110
- Come.
- You're disgusting!

243
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:31,641
- Let's go back. I'll go with you.
- Who's keeping you?

244
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,604
I'm begining to think you're
not a man.

245
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,001
- Sometimes... wouldn't you be in
love with me? - Stupid!

246
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,882
- Hi. - Hi.
- Laura, it's late, we have to go.

247
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,477
- Bye, Antonio.
- Bye.

248
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,685
You know, I've slapped him.

249
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:08,060
And l, I've kissed him.

250
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:10,093
I will too, I will kiss him!

251
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:20,011
- I'm begining to like Laura.
- Ornella is sweet, but she's a woman.

252
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:24,268
- Hey, come on, l'm hungry!
- One sec.

253
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:30,956
- She's still here.
- Are we going, or what? - Who?

254
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:36,207
- The daughter of the master of our city.
- Antonio, let's go! - Wait.

255
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:40,831
- Are you coming, Ettore? - What?
- Aren't we leaving? - See you later.

256
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,928
Alright, we've got it.

257
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:59,580
- Bye, champ.
- Bye.

258
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,697
- Bye, Ettore.
- Bye.

259
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:26,683
- Let's go, Mara! It's late.
- Let's stay a little more.

260
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:30,549
I had only one man in my life,
your grandfather.

261
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,577
You have one at every corner.

262
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:35,920
- Let those from your ancestors' city
alone. - Grandma, please.

263
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,547
They are stupid.
They only want...

264
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:45,832
And they're provincial, boring
bourgeois, not countryfolks like us.

265
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,885
Good morning, princess. Remember me?
General Barbieri's son.

266
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:29,145
Oh yes, it's true.
How much you've grown up...

267
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:34,527
- How's the general doing? - He's dead,
princess. - Oh... I'm sorry.

268
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,708
Have you met my niece, Mara?

269
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,200
How are you? Alright?

270
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:47,702
- Aren't you bored here?
- Yes, I am.

271
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:51,646
No...

272
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,374
- No?
- No.

273
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:01,591
Alright.

274
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:06,686
- I find the provinces amusing.
- What do you see in it?

275
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:10,629
You're all so full of faith,
of ideals...

276
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:14,887
Cities like ours are the healthy
side of the nation.

277
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:19,702
- How long will you be staying?
- I'm leaving tomorrow.

278
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:22,811
I don't believe it.

279
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:27,147
- Why not? - You've said it,
because you find provinces amusing.

280
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,325
The call of the forest
is too strong.

281
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:35,903
Waiter? The check, please.
Shall we go, grandmother?

282
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:39,633
- It was about time.
- What a pity.

283
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,171
I'm paying today.
What shall we do?

284
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:46,319
Well, I'll see Ornella, I'll break the
engagement, and then we'll be together.

285
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:48,308
For the rest of our life!

286
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:50,809
Hey, look! But that's Donatella!

287
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:55,911
- Franco's back, and didn't call on us?
- Franco! Franco!

288
00:27:55,956 --> 00:28:00,563
Hey, show yourself, honeymoon!

289
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:04,553
- Franco! Franco!
- Hey, spanish cow!

290
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:12,533
Blue prince! Come down!

291
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:17,049
- Hi.
- That's how you treat your friends?

292
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:20,910
- You're a traitor.
- Get down right now.

293
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:25,028
- Hi, Donatella.
- Madame... - Hi.

294
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,134
He's paying today.

295
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:33,467
Same old ways, isn't it?
How can you shout like this?

296
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:36,573
- Franco! - Franco. - It's almost
been a month since we've last met.

297
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:40,121
You've made such a noise
you've woken the entire palazzo..

298
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,621
- Donatella doesn't like such things.
- Cut it out, hypocrite.

299
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:47,324
No, I mean it, I really don't like
your tone.

300
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:52,664
Idiot.

301
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:56,235
That's how you'll learn not to
forget us.

302
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:59,740
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago. - Two days?!

303
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,917
I didn't have a free moment.

304
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:04,338
Franco, come here.

305
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,512
- Tell me, how did it go?
- What?

306
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,134
- Hey, you must tell us everything, but
everything. - Uffa. - How is it? - Uffa!

307
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:18,756
Ornella told us she had a transparent
nightgown, is it true?

308
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,381
And... was she afraid?

309
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:27,747
- How was she? - These are things that
don't concern you, alright?

310
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:30,060
You've pissed me off!

311
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:32,449
- You'll talk, you'll talk!
- Yes, good night, farewell!

312
00:29:32,494 --> 00:29:35,075
Franco, shall we meet after lunch?

313
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,827
I can't, I have to go with Donatella.

314
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:42,285
- Then this evening.
- We're having dinner at her parents'.

315
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:45,572
- See you tomorrow, bye.
- Bye. - Bye.

316
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:55,919
We should reeducate him.

317
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,907
Do you want to mess with Donatella?
Mind your business!

318
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:04,360
She's been a petty bourgeois for seven
generations. The perfect wife!

319
00:30:12,923 --> 00:30:15,298
- Franco?
- Yes?

320
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:20,593
- Have they angered you?
- No. - Cut them loose.

321
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:23,827
- They think they can play boys for ever.
- They're my friends.

322
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,809
- Friends?
- They're the only friends that I've got.

323
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,031
It's ready, madame.

324
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:52,087
You can go.

325
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:57,466
Why not boots also?

326
00:30:57,507 --> 00:31:02,354
I thought it was better to get her used
to it right away. But if it bothers you...

327
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:04,986
Not for me, for her,
the poor thing.

328
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:08,167
- What is it?
- Nothing, the salt.

329
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:10,923
- Adalgisa?
- Have you called for me?

330
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:14,224
- Could you bring the salt?
- It ain't? Me thought it was.

331
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:16,293
It doesn't fit!

332
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:21,670
If you think we've got 72
like this one...

333
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,056
- It's your aunt's gift.
- The salt.

334
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:26,647
Your grandmother wasn't joking
at all, either.

335
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:30,105
- Won't you finish that?
- No.

336
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:35,515
I'm not hungry. All this new stuff
took my appetite away.

337
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:38,225
It's like being in
a shop-window!

338
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:42,165
Excuse me.

339
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,840
You think I'm not finding it hard
to get used to it, too?

340
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:46,591
The nest...

341
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:51,557
It's as if I still don't matter at all
for you, everything displeases you.

342
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:54,815
The glass is ugly,
there's no salt...

343
00:31:56,288 --> 00:32:01,100
- Are you through? - Wasn't it good?
- Very good.

344
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:03,125
Could you please take
your gloves off?

345
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:06,514
- You don't want them anymore?
Should I take them off? - Yes, it's better.

346
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:14,791
- Now why are you crying?
- If I cry, it's because I love you.

347
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:19,887
If I wouldn't be loving you,
you've got no idea how I'd laugh!

348
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:23,751
Unfortunately, you're right, Franco,
the glasses, Adalgisa's gloves,...

349
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:26,298
.. let's throw everything,
and have lunch in the town.

350
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:30,713
- Where you used to go with your friends.
- With my friends? - Yes.

351
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:35,257
The last night we went at Dente's,
near the river. An enourmous omelette!

352
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:38,675
I was so drunk that evening, should have
seen me! You wouldn't have married me.

353
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:41,859
Should have seen Dente's face when we
threw him out of bed.

354
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:46,799
- Let's go right now! - Is it alright
like this, madame? - Very well.

355
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:49,947
Let's hope I won't get chilblains.

356
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:55,449
Two or three weeks went by,
I can't remember exactly how many,

357
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:58,125
the days went on being
the same for us.

358
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,587
One as hilarious as the next
and full of lightheartedness.

359
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,004
We each followed our love.

360
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:10,299
- Why are you coming with me?
- To get to know you.

361
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:13,087
You must have something special,
if they all fall for you.

362
00:33:13,134 --> 00:33:17,075
And now you're curious to find it out?
I've been looking for you for two weeks!

363
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:19,743
Well, here I am.

364
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:40,756
It's nice here...
Why don't we go down?

365
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:53,610
I like countryside so much,
the solitude...

366
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,710
I'm the one who'd like to know you.

367
00:33:59,393 --> 00:34:02,970
Don't you find me a little romantic?

368
00:34:03,015 --> 00:34:06,470
Yes... like all girls.

369
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,097
Of course, like all girls.

370
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:14,239
I've got nothing special,
I only am very rich.

371
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:20,322
It's a quality, but it's not
everything.

372
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:07,007
After all, it's a boring place,
I'm begining to get drowsy!

373
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:10,623
You're a moron!

374
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:14,016
No!

375
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:21,392
Hi, blackbirds!

376
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,782
Who's winning?

377
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,528
Hey, what's the matter with you?

378
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,720
Speak.

379
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,652
- Oh, what's the matter with this one?
- How should I know?

380
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:39,588
- Giulio!
- Boh! And three!

381
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:43,295
- Oh, and so what?
- And stop annoying me.

382
00:35:43,337 --> 00:35:47,391
- Stop it!
- If you want to speak, speak, if not...

383
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:51,886
- I'd like to know what good is being
friends... - That's what I say.

384
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:02,001
- You're against any temptation...
- Very funny!

385
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:04,629
And new!

386
00:36:09,412 --> 00:36:14,257
Say, Antonio, you've asked me a short
time ago what good is being friends.

387
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:17,603
- You should ask this someone else.
- Who?

388
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:22,940
You know I was sure of having a job,
I was keen on it.

389
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:27,475
Not so much for me,
as for my father.

390
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:29,744
Well, they've told me I haven't
got it anymore.

391
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:32,421
I wanted to know why.

392
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:37,824
- Franco's taken it away from me.
- Franco?!

393
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:43,042
- Come, let's go right now to Franco.
Come, Ettore. - Yes, let's go.

394
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:50,686
- What do you want? - You know it
too well. - You're a swine and a coward.

395
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,261
Come in.

396
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:06,446
Ettore's right,
you're a swine and a coward.

397
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:11,419
- You knew what that job meant to
Marcello. - I knew it, and you knew it.

398
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,761
- Donatella's father is the one that
got me the job. - That is a good reason!

399
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:19,586
Of course, if you see it this way, l
can only look mean.

400
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:25,122
Donatella wanted me to work.
And this is a reason.

401
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:29,058
Marcello knows very well that you
can't find a job everyday.

402
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:31,325
I've looked for one,
but in vain.

403
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:36,824
Donatella found it for me, and I found
myself facing a done deed.

404
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,815
And I didn't move a finger to
cheat Marcello.

405
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:44,463
- You should have refused.
- I know it, but I'm married.

406
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,854
A new life has begun for me.

407
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:52,074
I've got a wife, a house...
and a baby is on it's way.

408
00:37:52,115 --> 00:37:57,119
- It's like hearing my father. - You
don't know how married life changes you.

409
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,228
I've childishly taken on
responsibilities,

410
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:05,564
and now that I'm facing them I must
show no weakness, or scruples.

411
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:09,664
You can wait, I can't.

412
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:11,499
You're playing heroes now,

413
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:16,908
but our friendship has always been the
only morals in our life.

414
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:22,438
Cut it out, Antonio.
Cut it out!

415
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:27,781
Donatella's pregnant,
what should he have done, hit her?

416
00:38:28,898 --> 00:38:33,191
And then, we've all been a little
in love with her...

417
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:38,412
She has had me,
and not this stupid here.

418
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:40,797
Let's go, guys.

419
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,040
Bye... heroe.

420
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:51,906
Bye.

421
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:09,046
I think you've been too kind, one
must take care of one's interests!

422
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:13,108
That's what Franco did, and maybe
you'd have also done it.

423
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,935
- It isn't true.
- What a shitty world!

424
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:20,505
- Women are to blame for everything.
One should never fall in love. - True.

425
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:23,056
Guys, remember one thing:

426
00:39:23,102 --> 00:39:27,043
"sin is in women's nature,
like drinking and eating".

427
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:29,788
"There always is something tainted in
their faith."

428
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:32,537
- It's from Baudelaire.
- You're right.

429
00:39:32,577 --> 00:39:36,188
- And everytime we think we've found
an angel. - What a shitty world.

430
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,737
We should have thousands of women.
Thousands! They're all the same.

431
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:42,488
- Like those in Biscione street.
- Correct.

432
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:45,903
I'll get married when I'll use a woman
just for ironinig my shirts.

433
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,874
This is correct, too.

434
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:52,339
As far as I go, don't worry,
even then I won't marry.

435
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:54,646
- Bye!
- Bye. - Bye.

436
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,185
And no love!

437
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,269
I've never had a greater disillusion
than this in my whole life.

438
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:11,487
- Bye, Marcello.
- Bye. - See you later.

439
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:14,032
And remember: no love.

440
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:22,077
- Bye, Marcello!
- No love.

441
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:01,475
If you want...

442
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,642
Ah, thanks.

443
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:35,237
We're there.
This is where I live.

444
00:42:38,628 --> 00:42:40,733
- So long.
- So long.

445
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:11,762
- Give it to me, I want to hold it!
- No, no! - Wait for me!

446
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:27,817
The days of youth melt away
like snow in the sun.

447
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:30,127
Even that week flew away.

448
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:35,017
Franco called all of us, several
times. What were we to do?

449
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:37,128
Let's make peace.

450
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:40,280
On the day of the reconcilation
we were all at the club,

451
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:42,621
only Marcello was missing.

452
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:46,566
- Guys, Marcello's on the line.
- I'll get it. Let's go, kiddy

453
00:43:46,612 --> 00:43:48,593
Come on, Antonio.

454
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:53,689
- Who's winning? - Antonio.
- Didn't he dump you?

455
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:55,323
We're still friends.

456
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,076
And then it seems the fraternity of four
has decided they should become monks.

457
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:00,098
Can I cut in, then?

458
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,673
- Hey, guys. Marcello's not coming.
- How come?

459
00:44:05,482 --> 00:44:09,898
Confused call.
If you ask me, it's about a woman.

460
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:13,776
- Are you sure? - Sure? If I don't
smell these things...

461
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:16,879
- He's voice was trembling.
- He's not a man.

462
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:19,747
Guys...
Shall we go pick him up?

463
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,458
Sure thing. Let's go.

464
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:41,032
There are two spots where to fish
out that desertor.

465
00:44:41,073 --> 00:44:43,132
By the walls,
if he has carnal objectives,

466
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:46,205
or behind Mazzini's monument,
if the chick isn't yet ripe.

467
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,356
There's no way out of here.

468
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:55,835
- Hi, Ettore. - How's it goin'?
- Fine. - I'm glad.

469
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:57,864
Sorry!

470
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:08,379
- Are we going? - I'm not coming.
- And where're you going? - At the cinema.

471
00:45:08,422 --> 00:45:11,206
Now you're going at the cinema,
you're always pestering us,

472
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:13,433
and when it's about helping a friend,
you get lost.

473
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:17,010
- Some help... - Let's go. - I don't
feel like it, and that's that. Bye.

474
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,955
- Same slacker as always.
- Come on. - Same as usual.

475
00:45:22,832 --> 00:45:25,290
At last! Is Ettore there?

476
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:29,440
No. But what are you doing at home?
Why don't you come here?

477
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:33,138
There's fresh merchandise.
If you'd only see how gorgeous...

478
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:35,706
What do I care?
And Ettore...?

479
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:37,698
I've told you,
he went away, he's gone.

480
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:40,290
- Where?
- Phew, Laura...

481
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,861
How should I know, they were here
and, suddenly, they were gone.

482
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:47,847
- Hi.
- Hi, sit down.

483
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:52,627
- Has he asked about me?
- No.

484
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,881
Idiot!

485
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,333
- Ornella, tell me, how was he looking?
- Delicious.

486
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:05,837
He was wearing a cute
blue jersey. Bye!

487
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:09,342
What a nuisance!

488
00:46:10,704 --> 00:46:14,440
- Why aren't you with the others?
- Wasn't I supposed to come here?

489
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:17,033
We have to translate
the sixth chapter from Sallust.

490
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:28,235
He wasn't wearing the blue jersey.

491
00:46:31,864 --> 00:46:36,597
Comitatus, comitatus... comitatus.

492
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:40,410
- Comitatus!
- Cut it out, you're annoying me.

493
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:48,738
- Do you like Sagan? - She's too
pushy. She doesn't know what love is.

494
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:51,285
Oh, yes? Listen.

495
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:56,062
"There were times, in his arms, when
shyness follows love,

496
00:46:56,107 --> 00:47:01,792
I wanted to tell him: 'Luca, love me,
let's try. Let's just try'.

497
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,177
But I didn't, and just kissed his
mouth,

498
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:09,197
his forehead, his eyes... "

499
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:13,298
- Yes, it's nice.
- Hear this one also.

500
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:20,025
"Yes, I'm next to Luca,
I'm by his side,

501
00:47:20,074 --> 00:47:23,355
I only have to stretch my hand to
be able to touch him.

502
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:28,673
I know his body, his voice,
his way of sleeping. "

503
00:47:28,714 --> 00:47:32,686
I think there are sentiments
better kept to oneself.

504
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:36,071
Not everyone is like you.

505
00:47:39,063 --> 00:47:41,169
And you, do you know what love is?

506
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:43,754
No.

507
00:47:45,274 --> 00:47:49,043
Then you can't understand what l
feel about Ettore.

508
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,553
If you'd know how bad one feels...

509
00:47:52,598 --> 00:47:54,545
So bad, you want to be dead.

510
00:47:57,614 --> 00:48:01,872
- But, Ettore never speaks about me?
- Yes he does, often.

511
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:11,547
- Do you think I could make him fall
for me? - He already has.

512
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:16,682
Since I've slapped him,
the idiot hasn't shown himself.

513
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:20,700
Will you come with me at the cinema,
afterward?

514
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:24,184
At the Globo? See the Bergman movie?
- Wherever you want.

515
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,473
Guys, he must be behind the wall.

516
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:34,377
- Marcello! - Marcellino?
- Show yourself! - Marcello!

517
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:37,363
- Get out, Casanova!
- Get out!

518
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:43,890
- Guys, call lieutenant Pizzoglio.
- Quickly! - Lieutenant!

519
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:50,058
- You took young to searching the bush.
- Yes.

520
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:54,315
- I've said it, he isn't, it's serious.
- Serious my foot... - Yes, it is.

521
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:55,675
Charge!

522
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,688
Roars the lion!

523
00:49:00,373 --> 00:49:03,557
It's the first time I've been here,
it's really beautiful.

524
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,443
Where's my home?

525
00:49:15,483 --> 00:49:19,854
There, do you see those two towers
and the big dome?

526
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,159
Well, it's there, in the middle.

527
00:49:23,204 --> 00:49:25,028
And yours?

528
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:30,482
The same direction, a little further away,
almost in the suburbs.

529
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,794
My family's not rich.

530
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:38,245
My father is the manager of the asylum
for old people, and makes so little...

531
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:41,148
Where's the asylum?

532
00:49:41,876 --> 00:49:45,973
Down there, in the back,
behind those gardens.

533
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:50,504
Your town's so beautiful.

534
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:52,898
You've been here for two months,

535
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:56,982
two more, and it will seem
less beautiful.

536
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,604
I think I'll like it even more.

537
00:50:00,646 --> 00:50:04,621
Look at it, it's an italian town,
like there are hundreds more.

538
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:07,644
Had it's heyday
during Renaissance.

539
00:50:07,692 --> 00:50:10,115
Now, it's very plain.

540
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:14,217
Families overflow with good
traditions.

541
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:18,914
And still, it's terrible living
in the provinces.

542
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:23,570
It's a never ending fight...
against meanness,

543
00:50:23,616 --> 00:50:25,722
slander, hypocrisy...

544
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:30,916
Everything's wrong...
and everything's for ever.

545
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:36,216
Why don't you go away, go live
somewhere else?

546
00:50:38,564 --> 00:50:42,663
- Because the lion's here.
- No love! - Hey, Marcello!

547
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:46,593
- Now it's too much, no? - Marcello,
remember, no love.

548
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,812
- Who are they?
- My friends.

549
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,637
Don't encourage him, miss, look at me,
I've already been fooled.

550
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:56,310
- No love. - Marriage is the grave of
love and friendship.

551
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:59,565
Do you know these two almost fought?
For a job!

552
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:01,878
- Come on, introduce us.
- Come on. - Come on.

553
00:51:02,242 --> 00:51:06,533
- Ettore, Franco, Antonio... Lucia.
And now, goodbye. - What? - What?

554
00:51:06,581 --> 00:51:10,838
Hey, just a sec, we haven't even
shook hands, have we?

555
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:17,329
- And the lion... it's them? - What
lion, they are four mangy cats.

556
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:21,104
- Yes, we're the lion.
- We.

557
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:23,788
Congratulations.

558
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:26,643
- Can we leave?
- Come on, what's the rush?

559
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:33,091
- ldiots, Lucia must go back home.
- True? - No.

560
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,792
Then, let's go. And now, she's
compromised.

561
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,465
Tomorrow, as far as the town's concerned,
you'll be my latest conquest.

562
00:51:38,506 --> 00:51:41,643
- There's only one worse than me with women.
- Who? - Marcello.

563
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:44,148
You wouldn't say, with that face...

564
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,464
That's what you do when one of
you is with a girl?

565
00:51:46,508 --> 00:51:49,928
- Women are common property.
- And if you fall for the same one?

566
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:52,837
- We pass her.
- Then pass her!

567
00:51:53,554 --> 00:51:57,654
- Come on, don't get mad. A little
spirit won't kill you! - Let me be!

568
00:51:59,764 --> 00:52:01,792
Straighten up you tie.

569
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,764
The hamster.

570
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:10,450
- So, you aren't saying anything?
- The lion's depressed! - Oh, no! No.

571
00:52:12,006 --> 00:52:15,266
- Go with uncle Marcello, go.
- I don't want him. - Then throw him.

572
00:52:16,306 --> 00:52:19,645
- And... what is your name?
- Lucia. - Ah.

573
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,463
You know, Antonio is a great thinker.
He was writing poetry since a child.

574
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:28,038
- He wrote for a wonderful girl
who was in love with me. - Ah.

575
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:31,904
He even wrote for Marcello,
when he took his First Communion.

576
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,371
- Did he also write for your wife?
- No, I wouldn't have allowed him.

577
00:52:35,414 --> 00:52:38,834
- You can't trust him that much,
true, Ettore? - Very true.

578
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:43,932
- I wanna pee. - Afterward.
- No, now. - Enough, come.

579
00:52:43,973 --> 00:52:47,631
Why don't you tell me the poem you
wrote for Marcello's First Communion?

580
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:51,604
- I don't remember it. - Not even the
one for Franco's girl? - No.

581
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:54,033
Come on, improvise.

582
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:58,582
"Oh, love, listen to your
sweatheart's tale.

583
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:01,841
A man pain will suffer,
when friends abbandon him...

584
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:05,547
Because he will then now
men are infidel. "

585
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:08,331
- Do you know this poem?
- Yes.

586
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:12,397
- Hey, Marcello, they're talking poetry!
- Go to hell.

587
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:15,383
Shame!
What way of talking is this?

588
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:17,246
Excuse him. Let's go.

589
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:20,272
- I wanna pee.
- Afterward I said. - When?

590
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,816
Do you see him? He always is like this:
sad, melancholic, boring... and vulgar.

591
00:53:24,859 --> 00:53:29,309
- And what else?
- He hasn't stolen... yet.

592
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:34,007
Once arrived here, we go back.
What a life!

593
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,938
I'd have rather let myself be killed
than admit it,

594
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:44,436
but, for the first time in my life,
when with Lucia,

595
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:47,111
I understood l had lost my head.

596
00:53:47,151 --> 00:53:51,364
- I want the donkey. - Cut it out.
- I want the donkey! - Let's go.

597
00:53:51,412 --> 00:53:54,389
- Then let me pee.
- No, move on.

598
00:53:55,154 --> 00:53:57,702
In fact, we had decided
to save Marcello.

599
00:53:57,742 --> 00:54:00,843
We had met at the Club,
made a plan,

600
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:04,780
the usual one:
take away the girl.

601
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:06,854
I knew it'd come down to me.

602
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:12,265
Franco was married, and Ettore was
seeing a mysterious girl.

603
00:54:12,312 --> 00:54:14,766
It was only me remaining to save
him from Lucia.

604
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,477
I let the others do everything;
my conscience was clear.

605
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:36,532
- Hi, Lucia.
- Hi.

606
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:40,834
You know?
It's the third day...

607
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:44,449
It's the third day I've been
loving you.

608
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:47,635
I've rediscovered the world,
and I find it wonderful.

609
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:50,822
Even this sham of a city seems
different.

610
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:54,085
What I've told you the other day
were bollocks.

611
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:57,824
I love it's streets,
it's palaces, everything.

612
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:01,328
The falsity of it's people,
the "Good evening, lawyer"...

613
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:04,879
The evenings at the cinema
and the keys under the door.

614
00:55:07,786 --> 00:55:13,358
You know something? It's not true that
when in love you care less your friends.

615
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:15,268
You love them more.

616
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:18,485
I've forgiven them immediately
their behaviour from the other night.

617
00:55:18,536 --> 00:55:21,750
Remember? When they
tried to separate us.

618
00:55:22,598 --> 00:55:25,779
Especially Antonio,
because he is...

619
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:29,517
Where are we going? Tell me.

620
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:33,821
- I can't stay with you. - If you have
to go some place, I'll go with you.

621
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,287
No, Marcello, I'd rather go alone.

622
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,626
- Have you got a date?
- Yes.

623
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:45,208
- Do I know him?
- It's Antonio.

624
00:55:48,393 --> 00:55:52,843
- Where's the date?
- At the promenade roundabout.

625
00:55:54,206 --> 00:55:56,709
Can I go with you a little?

626
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:15,549
It seemed too good you'd come.
I had strong forebodings.

627
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:20,596
- And if I hadn't?
- I even hoped it, for a moment.

628
00:56:20,648 --> 00:56:24,341
But now you're here,
and I'm lost.

629
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:30,055
On the other hand, I ask myself why
I did come to you.

630
00:56:30,106 --> 00:56:32,562
Because I like you.

631
00:56:32,614 --> 00:56:34,914
That's something I say to all girls.

632
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:38,419
And have you never found one you
really liked?

633
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:41,967
We have our fill with Elenas, Marys,
Luisas here...

634
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:43,676
One no different from the other.

635
00:56:43,724 --> 00:56:48,300
Like they had branded on their forehead:
"I'm a good family bore".

636
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,358
- And l, am I not like the others?
- No.

637
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,131
- I'm looking for the ideal woman.
- Does she exist? - Yes.

638
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:04,778
She's the most beautiful girl,
subtle, and like transparent.

639
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:08,482
Two eyes like those of a little animal,
high cheekbones,

640
00:57:08,532 --> 00:57:12,665
softness in all features,
and she likes poets.

641
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:15,852
No, my father is the one
who likes them.

642
00:57:18,924 --> 00:57:21,187
Shall we walk?

643
00:57:22,427 --> 00:57:26,720
- There's where you go to make love?
- Let's turn back.

644
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:30,265
No, no, let's go all the same.

645
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:33,528
What good is it, Lucia?
What good is it?

646
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:36,235
We can try.

647
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:43,322
- I know what I feel, I don't need
any proofs. - And what about me?

648
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:53,287
Does Marcello also come here?

649
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:59,686
- How old are you, Lucia?
- Twenty, in ten days.

650
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:05,425
Will I be enough of a friend,
in ten days,

651
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:08,213
so to make the present I'm giving
you acceptable?

652
00:58:08,896 --> 00:58:13,664
Sometimes a kiss is enough
to become friends.

653
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:29,194
No love...

654
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,370
I don't want to stay,
Antonio, sorry.

655
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:40,823
I didn't understand why she had come,
nor why she had left.

656
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:45,604
But it was a very simple thing:
it was Marcello she loved, not me.

657
00:58:52,978 --> 00:58:55,039
Can I have a smoke?

658
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:02,730
Let's go back.

659
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:06,667
You've got a date with one
of your girls?

660
00:59:06,716 --> 00:59:09,933
What do you think, I've put on
a chastity belt?

661
00:59:09,982 --> 00:59:14,275
Everytime I came back from one of our
dates, I went with another girl.

662
00:59:14,323 --> 00:59:20,210
- Shall we go back?
- Our date isn't over yet.

663
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:23,550
I must go back to the Club,
I've got friends waiting for me there.

664
00:59:23,878 --> 00:59:25,667
They're right:

665
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:29,165
what little good life my have in store,
it comes from our friendship.

666
00:59:29,215 --> 00:59:31,480
It's me that's mad.

667
00:59:40,604 --> 00:59:42,663
Do you want to drive?

668
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:55,451
Console yourself, if you've had enough
of being with me,

669
00:59:55,496 --> 01:00:00,388
I was just going to tell you:
I'm leaving tomorrow.

670
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:04,047
Quite sudden.

671
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:07,518
In this boring town of yours I had
never stopped for more than a day,

672
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,108
and now, it's been two months
I've been here.

673
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,370
Don't you think it's enough?

674
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:18,579
- Where are you going? - Rome, first,
to say hello to my father, then lschia.

675
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:23,320
- And then?
- Then? I don't know.

676
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:30,763
Cannes, maybe,
or even Saint Tropez.

677
01:00:30,815 --> 01:00:34,915
Even if it's off-season,
it's still nice.

678
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:43,556
- When shall you be back? - In one year.
Seeing grandma, if she'll still be around.

679
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:50,525
- Weren't you in a hurry?
- Not anymore.

680
01:00:54,229 --> 01:00:59,076
- And your friends?
- I don't care.

681
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,118
Shall we get down?

682
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,617
No, here, in your car.

683
01:01:20,986 --> 01:01:24,725
How beautiful Lucia was on the
day of her engagement.

684
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:28,588
The pure and spiritual beauty
I had always dreamt at.

685
01:01:28,633 --> 01:01:31,056
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

686
01:01:32,496 --> 01:01:35,713
- Congratulations, Lucia.
- Thank you, Giulio.

687
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:41,489
How happy I am!

688
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:48,772
She's nice Lucia, isn't she?

689
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:53,035
But I assure you, I'll also be cute
as a fiancee.

690
01:01:53,424 --> 01:01:58,428
- lmagine what a couple we'd make.
- You're stupid! Stupid and frivolous!

691
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,484
- Yes... Yes, I know it, I'm not
the ideal woman. - Leave me alone!

692
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:06,195
Ornella!
Give me a Martini.

693
01:02:06,242 --> 01:02:08,540
Go, go! Go gossip.

694
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:15,133
We're inconstant and frivolous,
aren't we, Laura?

695
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:18,438
- Ornella, can you do me a favour?
- Two, even.

696
01:02:18,482 --> 01:02:22,094
Please, go to Ettore and tell him I'll
be waiting in the garden.

697
01:02:22,145 --> 01:02:25,123
Poor Laura... even you...

698
01:02:27,756 --> 01:02:30,859
- Ettore? - Eh?
- Ettore... - Say.

699
01:02:30,902 --> 01:02:35,318
If you can guess who's waiting for you
in the garden, I'll give you a kiss.

700
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,905
A flower.

701
01:02:41,529 --> 01:02:43,637
Can I have a smoke?

702
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:46,782
- Where are you going?
- Eh? Where could I go?

703
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:50,681
- I want to speak to you.
- Right now? What do you want?

704
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:54,384
Alright... Tomorrow.

705
01:02:54,425 --> 01:02:59,114
Giulio, I've understood what you wanted
to tell me. Laura, eh?

706
01:02:59,164 --> 01:03:03,105
Go ahead, I don't care!
You wanna know something?

707
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:07,039
You'll be the first to find out.
I'm marrying Mara.

708
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:10,498
I'm marrying a billion.

709
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:31,085
- Hi, Laura.
- Who knows what you'll think of me.

710
01:03:31,128 --> 01:03:35,658
- I'm so ashamed!
- If it's because of this, I'm used.

711
01:03:35,707 --> 01:03:38,887
But I love you more
than the others.

712
01:03:40,602 --> 01:03:43,149
But you don't even know me.

713
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:49,436
We've barely met.
Say... how do you think I am?

714
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:53,531
- Handsome, inside out.
- You're wrong.

715
01:03:53,578 --> 01:03:57,757
From all the boys you know,
I'm the worst.

716
01:03:57,799 --> 01:03:59,744
I can't love.

717
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:03,886
Because you haven't found the one
that really loves you.

718
01:04:06,077 --> 01:04:10,809
Imagine finding a woman capable of
love. True, Laura?

719
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:15,397
I am.

720
01:04:16,563 --> 01:04:20,377
- You're a little girl.
- No, it's not true.

721
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:25,233
And I've been loving you for more than
a year... and you know it.

722
01:04:33,356 --> 01:04:37,406
Kiss me here, then, where you've
slapped me before.

723
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:50,659
What a pity.. It's I that should
have known you better.

724
01:04:51,343 --> 01:04:53,323
There's still time.

725
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:56,911
No.

726
01:05:10,362 --> 01:05:12,625
- Bye, guys!
- Bye.

727
01:05:25,624 --> 01:05:29,121
- Going away?
- Mm? - Shall I walk you? - Yes.

728
01:05:38,158 --> 01:05:39,379
No!

729
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:45,175
I don't want to go back home.
Can you walk with me a little?

730
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:48,279
- Where?
- Wherever.

731
01:05:49,502 --> 01:05:53,598
- You're happy tonight. Why?
- You're happy, too. - Yes.

732
01:05:56,307 --> 01:06:01,512
- Do you think I'd make a good wife?
- Eh, depends who you'll marry.

733
01:06:02,673 --> 01:06:06,204
- I know who I'll marry, do you?
- I know who I love.

734
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:11,381
- What's the difference?
- Well...

735
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:18,619
I, for one, could be with a man I loved
even... without being married.

736
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:21,171
No, I couldn't.

737
01:06:21,217 --> 01:06:24,557
Sometimes I've thought about getting
married, having children,

738
01:06:24,601 --> 01:06:26,468
playing, wrestling with them...

739
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:30,844
- And if they were girls?
- Well, I'd be jealous.

740
01:06:33,831 --> 01:06:36,887
- Do you want to know something?
- Tell me.

741
01:06:36,935 --> 01:06:40,036
- I've never been with a woman.
- Never?

742
01:06:41,512 --> 01:06:43,492
No, never.

743
01:06:44,336 --> 01:06:46,001
Why?

744
01:06:46,985 --> 01:06:52,191
Because I only love one.
Have you heard about Marcello?

745
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:57,002
- What? - He's leaving. Says he'll
have a job in Milan and he's going.

746
01:06:57,052 --> 01:06:59,833
Where were you when he said that?

747
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,937
In the garden.

748
01:07:04,016 --> 01:07:07,309
- How stupid!
- Who, Ettore?

749
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:12,044
No, no... I'm not talking about Ettore,
I'm talking about Marcello.

750
01:07:12,093 --> 01:07:14,912
He only got engaged,
and he leaves her.

751
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:17,857
And you saying he was
so much in love...

752
01:07:17,904 --> 01:07:21,559
- Would you have done it?
- Yes.

753
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,468
- And then you talk about love!
- It's just because I'm in love!

754
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,611
You can't even imagine the suffering
Marcello goes through.

755
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:31,908
He was on the point of leaving thousand
of times... before knowing Lucia.

756
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:38,148
And yet, he stayed. It was great staying
here, in our town.

757
01:07:38,198 --> 01:07:40,747
With the girls, with his friends...

758
01:07:40,787 --> 01:07:42,732
Now, that he's known Lucia,

759
01:07:42,776 --> 01:07:46,715
the biggest happiness for him would
be... staying.

760
01:07:46,755 --> 01:07:50,773
He's leaving because he loves her,

761
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:56,182
he wants to marry her,
he wants her for life.

762
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:04,100
Will you take me home,
Big Eyes?

763
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:18,683
Few months afterward,
Ettore got married.

764
01:08:18,732 --> 01:08:21,470
How Laura cried that morning...

765
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:25,492
- If I'd be Laura, I'd kill myself.
- I'd kill him.

766
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:28,854
I prefer suicide to crimes.
The next day, everything's in the news.

767
01:08:28,903 --> 01:08:32,560
- I'm going to pick Laura up, see you
in church. - So long, big mouth.

768
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:47,866
- Are you ready, Laura?
- Yes, one moment.

769
01:08:48,506 --> 01:08:50,885
Hi. Laura, we're here.

770
01:08:53,402 --> 01:08:57,818
Poor Laura... Courage.

771
01:08:57,861 --> 01:09:01,237
After all, if he doesn't want you,
he doesn't deserve you.

772
01:09:01,286 --> 01:09:03,504
I've got courage, don't you worry.

773
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:06,058
They say it'll be the most beautiful
marriage of the last ten years,

774
01:09:06,102 --> 01:09:10,360
there will be important people from the
region, maybe even Maria Pia di Savoia.

775
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:14,341
They say Mara has a dream dress.

776
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:17,519
I can't take it anymore, I can't!

777
01:09:17,568 --> 01:09:22,097
Well, you shouldn't give him this
satisfaction.

778
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:25,090
- When the "yes" will be said...
- What will you do, Laura?

779
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:29,229
When I'll hear him say "yes",
I'll faint, I'm sure.

780
01:09:29,271 --> 01:09:33,040
- And then I'll start yelling,
yelling, yelling! - Swear it!

781
01:10:04,402 --> 01:10:06,668
Watch Laura.

782
01:10:16,981 --> 01:10:19,722
- What do you think she'll do?
- Mah...

783
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:25,417
Ettore Graziani, will you take Mara Rossi
Bandelli for your lawful wedded wife...

784
01:10:25,462 --> 01:10:30,793
.. according to the rite of our
Holy Mother, the Catholic Church?

785
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:32,657
Yes.

786
01:10:32,707 --> 01:10:36,998
Mara Rossi Bandelli, will you take Ettore
Graziani for your lawful wedded husband...

787
01:10:37,046 --> 01:10:43,250
.. according to the rite of our
Holy Mother, the Catholic Church?

788
01:10:43,295 --> 01:10:44,847
Yes.

789
01:10:50,701 --> 01:10:53,518
Nothing... nothing at all.

790
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,142
Hi.

791
01:11:08,216 --> 01:11:10,082
Don't move!

792
01:11:12,236 --> 01:11:16,291
Another one, one second.
Don't move!

793
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:19,597
Done, thank you.

794
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:26,122
- Hi.
- Hi. - Hi. - Nice party.

795
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:31,296
Hi, Giulio. We hadn't said hi yet.

796
01:11:31,344 --> 01:11:33,324
Hi, Laura.

797
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,594
- Could you bring me an orange juice?
- Yes.

798
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:44,159
- Laura? May l...
- Please. - Please.

799
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:46,501
- How do you feel, Laura?
- Alright.

800
01:11:47,505 --> 01:11:50,608
- Long live the bride and groom.
- Long live. - Here it is.

801
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,907
Congratulations.

802
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:59,228
- All you've got to do now, is wait for
granny's funeral. - Shut up.

803
01:12:06,995 --> 01:12:09,214
You don't want?

804
01:12:13,523 --> 01:12:17,052
Know what's being said? That the bride's
already expecting the heir.

805
01:12:17,103 --> 01:12:20,204
- Damn it, that Ettore!
- Here. - Thanks.

806
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:23,350
Well, I'll mingle for some news.

807
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:27,568
- You don't drink Martinis anymore?
- No, I feel like orange juice.

808
01:12:30,355 --> 01:12:32,700
Nice wedding, isn't it?

809
01:12:32,745 --> 01:12:34,806
Everybody's looking at you.

810
01:12:40,387 --> 01:12:43,408
I was looking for you, Giulio.
I want to talk to you.

811
01:12:43,451 --> 01:12:46,269
It was very strange.

812
01:12:46,315 --> 01:12:49,293
You know, like when having a
nightmare,

813
01:12:49,342 --> 01:12:52,601
and then you realise it was only
a dream.

814
01:12:52,645 --> 01:12:55,352
Why tell me this?

815
01:12:55,393 --> 01:12:58,493
Why not? Whom should I tell it to?

816
01:12:58,536 --> 01:13:02,271
You don't tell such things to someone
who has never existed.

817
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:05,678
You exist, Giulio. You exist!

818
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:10,457
Like an idiot until now.

819
01:13:12,586 --> 01:13:17,037
Don't regret it, we've always been
together, haven't we?

820
01:13:17,085 --> 01:13:19,790
Sure, we've translated
Sallust together.

821
01:13:20,347 --> 01:13:23,799
But I was alone,
alone like a dog.

822
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:34,150
But about Ettore! Why didn't you
never warn me about Ettore?

823
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:39,688
Why didn't you tell me he was cynical,
a liar, one who didn't believe in anything?

824
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:44,734
- It was my fault, I didn't know how
to behave like a man. - Giulio!

825
01:14:01,497 --> 01:14:05,600
- Let's hope he won't ressemble you.
- Better like us, than like you.

826
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:13,646
Enjoy life while you still can.
This is nothing. Hear him at night...

827
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:16,557
It's them that are
in a so damn hurry.

828
01:14:18,389 --> 01:14:22,495
That's how, inevitably, our life
went on, changing.

829
01:14:22,535 --> 01:14:24,801
We were not boys anymore.

830
01:14:24,846 --> 01:14:29,946
Franco had already had his first son,
Ettore was married, Marcello was leaving.

831
01:14:29,985 --> 01:14:34,518
For Giulio and Laura after so many
clouded days and thunderstorms...

832
01:14:34,566 --> 01:14:37,514
.. clear skies seemed to be
at the horizon.

833
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:42,009
On went life,
and love was it's name.

834
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:47,948
Livio, another bottle of cognac!

835
01:14:47,996 --> 01:14:52,210
Finished the baptism,
Lucia and Laura had gone home.

836
01:14:52,258 --> 01:14:54,682
No use mentioning Donatella.

837
01:14:54,727 --> 01:15:01,097
So, we were left alone, the whole evening
ahead of us, like in the old good times.

838
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:03,523
The lion had awaken.

839
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:08,751
- Guys, I want to have fun, I won't go
home tonight. - Neither shall I.

840
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:15,207
We don't care a damn about anything.
We don't care a damn about anything.

841
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:19,903
- Come on boys, let's go!
- Hey!

842
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:24,642
- Franco! - Franco!
- Let's go!

843
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:27,400
- Wait, Franco!
- Hey!

844
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,815
- Put it on my tab!
- Franco! Franco! Wait!

845
01:15:46,763 --> 01:15:48,952
- Come here!
- Me? - Guendalina!

846
01:15:48,997 --> 01:15:53,132
- Here she is. Our turkish woman.
- I'm not Guendalina.

847
01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:55,808
- Come closer.
- What do you want?

848
01:15:55,849 --> 01:16:00,623
- Let's see the thighs
- Ah, you're in such a hurry!

849
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:06,484
- Alright, come on... - Ah...
Know what we say: go to sleep!

850
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,984
Scoundrels! Criminals!

851
01:16:45,772 --> 01:16:49,275
Criminals, I know you!

852
01:17:01,932 --> 01:17:04,909
- Come on. Let's go.
- Stop! - We've arrived.

853
01:17:04,957 --> 01:17:07,781
Come on, cowards!
Let's see who jumps first.

854
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:09,934
- Let's get down!
- Get down, get down.

855
01:17:09,978 --> 01:17:13,640
- Come, come, Marcello!
Marcello! - Go, go!

856
01:17:21,091 --> 01:17:24,070
- Giulio, test the water.
- Right now, go.

857
01:17:24,118 --> 01:17:28,811
- How is it? - Warm.
- Fine. You try it, Franco. - Yes.

858
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:32,080
- Eh?
- It's warm!

859
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,504
- Hey!
- Ah, let's take a nice bath!

860
01:17:37,548 --> 01:17:41,570
- Hey, sirens!
- How is it? - It's cold!

861
01:17:58,603 --> 01:18:00,902
It's the end of the world.

862
01:18:02,308 --> 01:18:06,128
Hey, scoundrels,
give me a drink!

863
01:18:09,442 --> 01:18:13,260
We are here, having fun,
and my son might have a fever,

864
01:18:13,306 --> 01:18:18,519
or mumps...

865
01:18:18,566 --> 01:18:20,514
Cut it out!

866
01:18:20,918 --> 01:18:23,339
Give me a drink,
scoundrels!

867
01:18:23,385 --> 01:18:26,049
Giulio? Where's Giulio?

868
01:18:26,096 --> 01:18:29,076
"How beautiful is tender youth,
no man can stop her fly,

869
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:32,943
Be merry who so wish,
tomorrow nothing's sure. "

870
01:18:32,988 --> 01:18:39,277
Giulio, bring me a bottle of
Chavlet '27.

871
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:42,303
- Did you bring it?
- Here it is, sir!

872
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:45,932
And now, a souffle al Grand Marnier,

873
01:18:45,977 --> 01:18:48,358
.. and chocolate and strawberries
profiteroles.

874
01:18:48,409 --> 01:18:51,231
- Have you brought them?
- At your service.

875
01:18:56,536 --> 01:19:02,224
- I can't kick my arse anymore.
- You must climb the tree.

876
01:19:07,953 --> 01:19:12,372
Opla! Always higher!

877
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:15,918
Hey, look at me.

878
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:23,680
You, who are in love and happy, say,
why do we always end up drunk?

879
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:26,156
How should I know?

880
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:33,287
Oh God, the mumps...
Who invented mumps?

881
01:19:34,527 --> 01:19:40,659
- Why do women always fall for the good
guys? - I don't know.

882
01:19:41,222 --> 01:19:43,680
Why are we here?

883
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:48,753
I'm here while my son's sick.

884
01:19:50,346 --> 01:19:53,134
I can't hear my son cry...

885
01:19:53,177 --> 01:19:55,441
I can't hear my son cry!

886
01:19:55,486 --> 01:19:58,468
- Cut it out, Franco.
- But my son's sick!

887
01:19:58,514 --> 01:20:02,254
Giulio, bring me blond virginian tobacco,
with honey.

888
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,852
- Have you?
- Yes.

889
01:20:03,894 --> 01:20:07,474
And now, a bottle of Scotch,
I'll get drunk as a pig.

890
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:09,785
- Have you?
- Yes.

891
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:11,338
And now, bring me...

892
01:20:14,452 --> 01:20:16,639
.. bring me Laura.

893
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:22,537
- "You, happy and in-love... "
- Cut it out!

894
01:20:22,579 --> 01:20:24,767
No, I won't, you must answer me.

895
01:20:24,812 --> 01:20:28,188
Are you happy I don't cry?
I'm not taking your girls away anymore.

896
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,135
- Cut it out, cut it out.
- No, we have to speak.

897
01:20:32,978 --> 01:20:34,645
About what?

898
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,677
True.

899
01:20:36,724 --> 01:20:40,985
The omelette! Let's go to Dente
and eat an omlette! Let's go!

900
01:20:48,102 --> 01:20:51,446
- You're not drunk.
- No.

901
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,743
- You knew I had to go to work in
Milan, didn't you? - Yes.

902
01:20:56,787 --> 01:20:59,689
I've received the cable.

903
01:20:59,737 --> 01:21:04,710
Don't tell the others...
I'm leaving tomorrow.

904
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:28,345
It's closed, there isn't
a restaurant anymore.

905
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:31,092
- And Dente?
- He's dead.

906
01:21:32,728 --> 01:21:35,867
Let's go, suckers,
I'll take you to town.

907
01:21:58,068 --> 01:22:02,600
- What's the matter? - I feel ill.
- Stop, stop! Giulio's sick.

908
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:06,149
- Ettore, stop!
- He can puke, I don't care.

909
01:22:50,183 --> 01:22:54,001
- I'll take the red-haired!
- And I the frenchie.

910
01:22:56,261 --> 01:23:01,314
- Hey aren't you coming?
- Go ahead, I'll catch up.

911
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:07,364
Let's go! Giulio...
Cuckold, you're a a cuckold.

912
01:23:13,312 --> 01:23:17,335
No, Giulio is not coming.

913
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:21,517
Giulio's going home.

914
01:23:25,305 --> 01:23:29,679
She loves me... She loves me!
And I'll marry her!

915
01:23:50,687 --> 01:23:53,713
Hey, you didn't forget!

916
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:14,503
Yes! What a beautiful car, it seems
a bedroom.

917
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:18,416
- Come, get in. Happines is here tonight.
- Yes!

918
01:24:18,456 --> 01:24:21,676
- And Giulio? - He must have gone.
- Why didn't you stay with him?

919
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:25,544
- He did well to go.
- Why don't you also go?

920
01:24:30,689 --> 01:24:33,476
Take your hands off.

921
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:04,094
- You disgust me!
- What have I done to you?

922
01:25:04,138 --> 01:25:07,117
You have.
Where's your conscience?

923
01:25:07,165 --> 01:25:09,828
You've left it at home,
with your wife?

924
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:13,298
You've always been Don Pizzuto's
favorite cleric, haven't you?

925
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:17,683
- Yes, but Mara's at home and you're
fooling with these... - Cut it out!

926
01:25:17,725 --> 01:25:19,706
Why, what are you?

927
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:23,450
Why should shit like this happen to us?
I want to go back!

928
01:25:25,892 --> 01:25:27,716
Shut up!

929
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:46,501
- What do we do afterward?
- How should I know? - Eh? - Don't know.

930
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:23,973
I was really hungry.

931
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:28,081
It ain't that good this mortadella,
is it?

932
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:33,502
- Do you have a kid?
- Hey, change the music!

933
01:26:33,543 --> 01:26:35,888
You have.

934
01:26:37,528 --> 01:26:40,188
Alright, I have.

935
01:26:53,445 --> 01:26:56,266
Carmelo, put another record.

936
01:27:00,736 --> 01:27:04,160
- Who takes this one? - You! You!
What do I care?

937
01:27:04,204 --> 01:27:08,180
- Let's not start it all over!
- ldiot! What do you want to do?

938
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:12,522
- I don't need these!
- Then go!

939
01:27:15,498 --> 01:27:17,287
We're disgusting.

940
01:27:24,085 --> 01:27:28,675
- I'm going.
- Hey, blondie! - Farewell, friends.

941
01:27:30,342 --> 01:27:33,955
Why, isn't she a girl like
any other?

942
01:27:34,006 --> 01:27:35,954
You're drunk.

943
01:27:35,998 --> 01:27:39,895
What do you think,
that Lucia's better than her?

944
01:27:43,408 --> 01:27:47,545
You've said at last, what was on your
mind. You're jealous, that's it!

945
01:27:47,593 --> 01:27:50,097
Since Lucia loves me,
you hate me.

946
01:27:50,621 --> 01:27:53,646
- Get lost.
- Stay calm! - Hey!

947
01:27:53,688 --> 01:27:56,591
It's always like this
when you go together?!

948
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:03,604
- Cut it!
- Don't mess with me!

949
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:47,669
Go to hell! Drop dead!
Dead!

950
01:29:30,015 --> 01:29:33,831
- Are you late?
- If only you'd lose this train.

951
01:29:33,876 --> 01:29:37,649
Sst... Don't say anything,
it's useless now.

952
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:40,966
I'm sorry. But how could l...?

953
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:45,271
And me? I can't conceive being
far away from you!

954
01:29:45,312 --> 01:29:47,023
Here it is!

955
01:30:11,056 --> 01:30:15,412
Milan is a big city,
you'll have fun.

956
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:20,370
And then, there's your work...

957
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:23,205
But I, alone, here...

958
01:30:23,249 --> 01:30:25,715
What did you promise me?

959
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:31,512
Not to cry,
'cause you're not going to war.

960
01:30:53,432 --> 01:30:55,545
Bye, fatty!

961
01:30:56,468 --> 01:31:00,584
- Who was that?
- A ghost.

962
01:31:02,266 --> 01:31:07,973
- Who knows how many ghosts dwell
on these streets. - Are you jealous?

963
01:31:08,022 --> 01:31:15,174
Yes... and most of all
on Antonio and all the others,

964
01:31:15,376 --> 01:31:18,847
all those that have seen you since
you were a little boy...

965
01:31:18,897 --> 01:31:21,692
I was a fool, like now.

966
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:34,277
Damn! How many matches they'll
play without me!

967
01:31:34,327 --> 01:31:37,123
I beat them all,
I was the strongest.

968
01:31:38,724 --> 01:31:41,282
And they're still sleeping.

969
01:31:43,483 --> 01:31:46,595
They were dead drunk
yesterday night.

970
01:31:52,397 --> 01:31:55,944
If I only could give you something
in exchange for your love.

971
01:31:55,996 --> 01:31:58,189
What are we hoping for?

972
01:31:58,234 --> 01:32:02,305
One of those engagements
that go on for years and years,

973
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:05,979
Like those of our grandparents?

974
01:32:08,908 --> 01:32:11,979
Some luck you had meeting me.

975
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,492
I'm happy like this.

976
01:32:25,338 --> 01:32:27,769
We did so many things together,
I and my friends.

977
01:32:27,816 --> 01:32:30,487
The entire city was ours.

978
01:32:30,534 --> 01:32:34,684
Antonio was right with that poetry
of yours:

979
01:32:34,732 --> 01:32:37,770
"Oh, love, listen to your
sweatheart's tale,

980
01:32:37,812 --> 01:32:41,245
A man pain will suffer,
when friends abbandon him".

981
01:32:41,288 --> 01:32:45,916
Why are you saying this?
You'll soon be back, and see them again.

982
01:32:45,966 --> 01:32:52,483
Yes. But for now everything's over,
and we haven't even said farewell.
