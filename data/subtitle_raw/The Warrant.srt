00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,610
Fire!

4
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:54,334
Each of our lives is a story.

5
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:58,304
<i>And every story is</i>
about a struggle.

6
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,540
<i>A fight.</i>

7
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:04,377
<i>A fight against sickness...</i>

8
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,347
<i>poverty...</i>

9
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:08,548
<i>each other.</i>

10
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,622
<i>Some fight for big things.</i>

11
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:17,524
<i>Ideas...</i>

12
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:19,726
<i>freedoms...</i>

13
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:23,329
<i>rights.</i>

14
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,773
<i>Some fight for little things.</i>

15
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:37,177
<i>A name, a piece of land...</i>

16
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,212
<i>Or for a friend.</i>

17
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,916
<i>The little liberties.</i>

18
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:55,962
<i>There's a fight</i>
inside men as well.

19
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,864
<i>A fight against a reckoning.</i>

20
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,802
<i>A reckoning of all</i>
the things we've done.

21
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,608
<i>Or didn't do.</i>

22
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,915
<i>My granddaddy...</i>
He called it a warrant.

23
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:24,444
<i>"Dear Bonnie,</i>
today marks four years.

24
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,412
<i>Four years of fightin'.</i>

25
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:28,948
<i>Feels like 400.</i>

26
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,120
<i>At the time of this letter,</i>
our son's still safe and well.

27
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:37,023
<i>As well as can be expected.</i>

28
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:40,593
<i>He's become close with</i>
Virgil's boy, Perkins.

29
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,895
<i>I know you don't</i>
approve of "The Saint"

30
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,964
<i>as we've come to call him.</i>

31
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,433
Let's go.<i> Ironic, I know.</i>

32
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,369
<i>But his son is a good kid.</i>

33
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:55,141
<i>When I get back-</i>
When we get back...

34
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,443
<i>We'll have stories</i>
to tell, Bonnie girl.

35
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:22,635
No joy?

36
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,003
He won't check his gun
and he won't tell me

37
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,439
why he's here.

38
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,408
Boar headed bounty hunter.

39
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,176
I'll go in and get him out.

40
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:32,779
You know what
happened last time.

41
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,581
<i>Assault and battery,</i>
aggravated assault, attempt to-

42
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,949
Well what about him?

43
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,018
Murderin', robbin',
horse thievin'.

44
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,753
<i>Be careful</i> is all I'm sayin'.

45
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:42,588
Careful?

46
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,123
All these years we've
been ridin' together,

47
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,658
I've never heard you talk like-

48
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,827
Don't get all mushy
on me, Sheriff.

49
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:49,662
I ain't talkin'
about your health.

50
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:52,932
I'm thinkin' about
your job, my job.

51
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,700
Just because some black-eyed...

52
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:56,102
Black-eyed?

53
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:57,804
Bloody-nosed jay hawker...

54
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,839
Bloody-nosed?

55
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,941
Jack Swanson came at me
with a blade and weren't

56
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:05,845
no butter-knife neither. Break,
you used a fence-post on him.

57
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:08,448
He had more than a black
eye and a bloody nose.

58
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,949
What was I supposed to
do, let him stick me?

59
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,485
Tread gently is all.

60
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:16,456
Bonnie said you had it in you,
lands and lovers and such.

61
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:21,694
And such.

62
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,529
You go around the back just
in case he makes a run for

63
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,864
it when the tickling starts.

64
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,799
The tickling ain't
what makes me nervous.

65
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:28,868
Well, it should!

66
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,576
Hello Bobby.

67
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:38,578
Your mama teach ya how to fight?

68
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:42,014
Don't you talk about my mama!

69
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:47,520
<i>What?</i>

70
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,888
He insulted my mother.

71
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,756
<i>You</i> didn't even know your mama.

72
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:53,593
All the more, Buge,
all the more.

73
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,232
Who sent ya?

74
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:01,667
Nobody.

75
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:02,735
Never heard of him.

76
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:03,970
You ever heard of him?

77
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,506
<i>A Mr. Nobody.</i> Hard to say.

78
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:09,108
Oh heck, Buge, they say you're
the brains of the outfit.

79
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,043
I thought I was the looks.

80
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:14,280
Up!

81
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:19,585
You are the third
tight-lipped bounty-hunter

82
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,467
we've had to move
out this month.

83
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:24,190
There's something
cookin' around here Buge.

84
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,526
And it's making me hangry.

85
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:31,197
<i>You heard</i> that carpetbagger.

86
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,267
He's offering good,
hard coin for The Saint.

87
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,768
Dead or alive.

88
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,236
Where's the Union now?

89
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,005
Where's their promises?

90
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:42,241
They ripped our world apart!

91
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:44,210
Where's their promise of mercy?

92
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:46,979
The Saint's been
stealin' those promises.

93
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:50,016
Breakin' it while they sit
back gettin' fat on victory.

94
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:52,184
My farm's in ashes.

95
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,153
My kids is hungry.

96
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,589
The Union's failed us again.

97
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,291
It's on us, to take what's ours.

98
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:00,026
Are you boys
talkin' about The Saint?

99
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,931
What's it to ya?

100
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:09,001
Well, a friendly piece of
advice, I would stay clear.

101
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:10,603
<i>Let the law work for ya.</i>

102
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:12,038
Not against ya.

103
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,106
The law ain't feedin' my family!

104
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,144
Neither are you, if you're<i> dead.</i>

105
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:19,345
What'd you say?

106
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,782
Is that a threat boy?!

107
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,984
Come on down here and face us
like a man or I'll shoot you-

108
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:28,788
I'd lower that hammer
before I drop mine.

109
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,791
Uh-uh. DEPUTY SHANKS:<i> You heard</i>
the deputy marshal, now drop it.

110
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:46,672
Steer clear, boys,
you've been warned.

111
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:56,148
<i>Jeremiah.</i>

112
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,050
<i>Stay safe, fellas.</i>

113
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,391
No.

114
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:44,830
Hmph.

115
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:51,971
No.
It's more like this.

116
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,048
My son never had many friends.

117
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,950
War will make 'em brothers
before it's all over.

118
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:09,689
Want any of this?

119
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,323
Got it off a Georgia boy.

120
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,794
I don't suppose that
was an even trade?

121
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,462
Spoils of war,<i> brother.</i>

122
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:22,468
John? Hmm?

123
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:27,440
I've seen you stare
down a bear with only a round

124
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,141
<i>left in your chamber.</i>

125
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,477
I've seen you crack more
skulls and break more bones

126
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,978
than any man in the territory.

127
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,313
I mean, you're as
tough as they come.

128
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:38,384
But when it comes to
these gray backs...

129
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:40,152
your sympathy concerns me.

130
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,889
Well...

131
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:46,792
that bear had it coming,
he killed my dog.

132
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:49,028
As for cracking and breaking
something, I'd rather

133
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,465
put something in a sling
than in a grave.

134
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:55,134
As for them...

135
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:57,970
I believe in what
we're fighting for.

136
00:11:57,972 --> 00:12:00,873
Doesn't mean I have to hate
who I'm fighting against.

137
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,208
Mm.

138
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,480
Sound any good?

139
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:08,948
Yeah.

140
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:12,418
Keep it simple.

141
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,254
Good guys in blue,
bad guys in gray.

142
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:17,757
Well, that's not how I see it.

143
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,130
When this is over...

144
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:27,333
If Davis and Lee and the rest
of these guys aren't dancing

145
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:29,335
at the end of a rope...

146
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:32,805
I'm gonna pay old Honest
Abe a visit myself.

147
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:35,508
That talk brings trouble, Virg.

148
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,276
Trouble can find me.

149
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:01,433
<i>John?</i>

150
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,572
You make 'em out?

151
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,946
Too far. Oh.

152
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,048
It's the marshal.

153
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,051
Guess he heard
about the fence post.

154
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:20,452
Fence post?

155
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:22,087
You sure it's him?

156
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,389
Of course, I'm sure.

157
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:25,958
Look at how he sits
in that saddle.

158
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,827
He rides like you.

159
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:29,995
I look that good?

160
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:33,265
What's that on his head?

161
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,100
Is that a new hat?

162
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:37,937
And a new deputy.

163
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,106
Huh...

164
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:44,276
How do you do, marshal?

165
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,978
Mom, Sheriff.

166
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,580
This is Deputy Shanks.

167
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,315
Afternoon, ma'am.

168
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:51,317
Deputy Shanks, call me Bonnie.

169
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,118
It's a pleasure.

170
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:57,089
And this is Sheriff Breaker.

171
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,992
His<i> daddy.</i>

172
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:02,261
Well, it's an honor, Sheriff.

173
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,063
Shanks.

174
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:06,398
You wouldn't happen to be kin
to a Colonel Williford Shanks,

175
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,967
would ya?

176
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,236
Yes sir, that's my daddy.

177
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:12,204
You're Willy's boy!

178
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:14,073
I'll be.

179
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:16,575
How is old guts n' glory doing?

180
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,612
Uh, well...

181
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:21,981
He actually passed
last spring sir.

182
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,916
<i>Caught pneumonia.</i>

183
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:26,352
<i>But he told me plenty</i>
of stories about you.

184
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,287
<i>Mostly from the war.</i>

185
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,422
He was a good man.

186
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:32,324
<i>You look a lot like him.</i>

187
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:34,460
Thank you, sir.

188
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:36,262
Bugle.

189
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:39,064
Marshal.

190
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,366
You boys hungry?

191
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:42,134
Can I put on a chicken? M'm...

192
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:43,936
<i>You've slaughtered enough</i>
chickens on my account.

193
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,671
Whatever the Sheriff's
having, that'd be fine.

194
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:47,172
No, no, no; Those
chickens have been

195
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:48,641
thrivin' under my
shadow too long.

196
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,542
The only time I get a
treat is when you show up.

197
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:52,511
Bonnie, slaughter
the fatted hen.

198
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:54,580
The prodigal has returned.

199
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,582
<i>Fried</i> chicken, then.

200
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:58,384
M'm.

201
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,225
I uh... suppose you heard
about the whole fence post

202
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:08,060
thing and Jack Swanson and all?

203
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:09,595
I did.

204
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:10,663
And I suppose
that's why you're here.

205
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,498
It's not.

206
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,166
That lawyer had all the facts
all twisted, he's making

207
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,001
this whole stink about it.

208
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:17,536
That guy had himself a knife.

209
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:19,071
- Didn't he have a knife on him?
<i>- Sheriff...</i>

210
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:21,307
That is between you,
him and the fence post.

211
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,275
I am here on more
prudent matters.

212
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:25,044
He called me Sheriff again.

213
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:26,578
Listen, son...

214
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,180
If you're gonna stand on
my property with that belly

215
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,682
growlin' for one of
my chickens, you'll call

216
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:32,184
me dad, pa, father...

217
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:35,120
Or if you're feeling
especially tender, daddy.

218
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:39,224
<i>Done!</i>

219
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:42,261
I'm here on matters other than
your fence post escapades.

220
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,330
Escapades?

221
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,232
He's back.

222
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:07,453
<i>Now have you seen this?</i>

223
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,192
No.

224
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:14,326
If I knew where he was,
I would've hunted and

225
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:16,528
found him a long time ago.

226
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,397
I know where he is.

227
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,033
You<i> think</i> you do. I do.

228
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,668
Even if you think you
do, he's not gettable.

229
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,004
Not just the two of you.

230
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:28,340
<i>Well, someone has to try.</i>

231
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:31,343
I have a warrant for his arrest.

232
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,479
That's just a piece of
rollin' paper to him.

233
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:34,747
<i>It is my duty to deliver</i>

234
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,682
that warrant and
to bring him back.

235
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:38,484
A warrant for The Saint?

236
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:40,586
Well, whose boot did he spit
on, because jayhawkers like

237
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:44,056
that are small potatoes
to the likes of Washington.

238
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:45,591
There have been whispers...

239
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:48,260
and rumors that have made it
all the way to Washington.

240
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:50,496
Rumors rubbed together
don't make a warrant.

241
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:53,565
<i>We have information</i>
that him and his crew...

242
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:56,335
<i>they have been hitting</i>
reconstruction supply lines,

243
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:59,638
<i>raiding encampments,</i>
profiteering, leaving a mess

244
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,206
<i>wherever they hit!</i>

245
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,410
Taking supplies,
women, leaving bodies!

246
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,446
Now all that intel,
that leads here.

247
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,049
Kansas?

248
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,552
You start flipping rocks
over in Kansas, you're

249
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,789
gonna find more desperate
deserters than rattlesnakes.

250
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,592
You're better off asking Grant
for a regiment of expendables.

251
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,630
The president?

252
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:26,265
The government asked<i> me.</i>

253
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:29,468
And now, I'm asking you.

254
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,570
Wha-

255
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,539
What?

256
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,809
Well, why didn't you say
that in the first place?

257
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,710
I was trying to.

258
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:41,480
The only thing is you would
need to become my deputy.

259
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:43,849
A deputy, Break.

260
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:45,651
A deputy?

261
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:48,587
Well, we would have
to cross state lines.

262
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,456
John...

263
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,358
<i>The Saint has been stirring</i>
up all kinds of trouble.

264
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,660
<i>Pickin' fights with</i>

265
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:57,496
deserters, bushwhackers,
any southerner...

266
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,665
<i>that's paths he cross.</i>

267
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:05,370
The bounty is unwarranted
and unsanctioned but...

268
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:11,376
<i>it is backed by rich</i>
investors and carpetbaggers.

269
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:13,879
<i>Bounty hunters from all over</i>
have been winding up dead.

270
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:17,683
<i>Everybody wants this reward</i>
but nobody can claim it.

271
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:24,423
Carpetbaggers,
banking bushwhackers.

272
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:26,725
Trespassing bounty hunters.

273
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:29,261
Bobby the bear.

274
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,263
I told you somethin'
was cookin'.

275
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:33,265
You warned me, 100.

276
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,666
<i>This man wants war.</i>

277
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:36,401
If he can light a fire, he will.

278
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:38,704
Now if the bushwhackers
get him, then...

279
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:42,841
But this man is living as
if the war is still on.

280
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:47,412
If he keeps going on the
way that he is then...

281
00:18:47,414 --> 00:18:49,448
he could reignite the Civil War.

282
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,358
Now hold on.
The Saint's a slippery one.

283
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,460
He's not gonna be stopped with
a smile and a piece of paper.

284
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:02,261
<i>Then we bring him</i>

285
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,829
inthe hard way.

286
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:05,430
Cut from the same cloth.

287
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:07,900
Like wool, in summer.

288
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,204
Alright...

289
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:13,639
Show me something about
his little group here.

290
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:16,175
I'm not used to The Saint
having a gaggle with him.

291
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:24,750
This is Anvil.

292
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:01,753
He can and will shoot
you dead in a heartbeat.

293
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:04,790
<i>But he prefers to</i>
fight more personal.

294
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:08,227
<i>They say his fists might</i>
as well be horse hooves.

295
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:11,630
<i>Weapon of choice:</i>
Brass knuckles.

296
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:13,498
I got it, don't get close.

297
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,901
Easier said than done.

298
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,903
<i>Meet Holt.</i>

299
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,314
<i>A hunter.</i>

300
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:31,984
<i>You'll hear his gunshot</i>
before you see him comin'.

301
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:36,388
<i>Franklin York.</i>

302
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,458
<i>We're being ambushed!</i>

303
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,326
<i>Go, go, ride for help!</i>

304
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,530
One of the best
snipers in the business.

305
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,000
<i>If he can see you in the</i>
distance, he can hit you.

306
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,324
Claims that he's shot
more than a dozen officers

307
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:14,559
<i>off their horses.</i>

308
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:17,462
<i>Says he doesn't miss.</i>

309
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:19,631
<i>Everybody misses.</i>

310
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,066
<i>Who's next?</i>

311
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:23,035
<i>George Washington, Jr.</i>

312
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:29,675
<i>Claims he's the direct</i>
descendant of the president.

313
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:33,478
<i>Says if America was a</i>
monarchy he'd be king.

314
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:39,051
<i>Washington didn't</i> have any kids.

315
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:40,385
<i>He didn't?</i>

316
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:41,953
<i>Well, don't tell him that.</i>

317
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:43,622
<i>Tucker Macready.</i>

318
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:46,758
<i>He will kill anyone he</i>
sees as a rebel sympathizer.

319
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:04,443
Aah!!

320
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,612
<i>They say he's the</i>
musician of the group and.

321
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:09,448
<i>The Saint's right hand man.</i>

322
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,717
<i>And he is mean.</i>

323
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:17,923
Music, the great equalizer.

324
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,361
<i>Stacey Snyder.</i>

325
00:22:22,363 --> 00:22:23,862
A girl.

326
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:36,742
<i>An unknown,</i>
a mystery, a liability.

327
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:38,510
<i>Pretty, but you'll hit the floor</i>

328
00:22:38,512 --> 00:22:41,880
<i>before you can say, "Miss."</i>

329
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:43,648
<i>They say she holds</i>
her own though, against

330
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,617
<i>the rest of the bunch.</i>

331
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:48,053
<i>Makes her scary enough for me.</i>

332
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:51,923
I don't ever remember
having to fight no woman.

333
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:55,494
That's because mom whooped
you a long time ago.

334
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:57,929
<i>Well, maybe I should show</i>
these people how I curbed

335
00:22:57,931 --> 00:23:00,132
your teens over my knee.

336
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:03,168
I don't fight my subordinates,
Deputy Breaker.

337
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,737
Deputy Breaker, Deputy...

338
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:07,439
What's in a title?

339
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:10,776
Just a word made up by some
man sitting behind a desk.

340
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:12,811
Besides...

341
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:15,747
What better company
for my compromise?

342
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,763
<i>And of course they</i>
are all led by Virgil.

343
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,565
<i>"The Saint."</i>

344
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:52,050
"We must extinguish

if we want harmony and union."

346
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:00,692
Your newspaper's outdated.

347
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,968
Where's the gold?

348
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:13,138
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,707
We were only transporting
food and supplies

350
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,242
to the starving in St. Louis.

351
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:34,559
Kansas supplies
for Missouri rebels.

352
00:24:34,561 --> 00:24:36,127
<i>I swear.</i>

353
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:37,996
There's no money!

354
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,738
I don't trust bushwhackers.

355
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,773
I'm not a bushwhacker!

356
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:53,111
I'm an officer of
the Union army.

357
00:24:53,113 --> 00:24:58,717
I serve Bates Guard, sixth
Missouri volunteer infantry!

358
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:02,220
Bates Guard? Yes sir!

359
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:05,223
I... I'm sorry, sir.

360
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:06,758
Untie him.

361
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:13,865
Have a seat.

362
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,901
Have a seat, c'mon.

363
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:33,251
You have any children?

364
00:25:33,253 --> 00:25:35,120
I got three boys.

365
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,159
I had two sons.

366
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:44,896
They used to help me run
my spread, not too far

367
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:46,665
from here actually.

368
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:54,172
One of them decided he
didn't like farming.

369
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:57,075
Wanted to try his luck
on the Mississippi.

370
00:25:57,077 --> 00:26:00,278
I condemned it, naturally.

371
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:08,280
But I woke to find he took my
best horse and my favorite gun

372
00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:13,725
and ran off, leaving me and
my other son to run the place.

373
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:17,762
On the eve of the war,
he came back to me.

374
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:21,833
Robbed, beaten, half starved.

375
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:27,238
He came back to me with an
apologetic grin, a smirk.

376
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,807
He said...

377
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:33,845
"I'm sorry, daddy.

378
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:36,848
You were right."

379
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,050
And I said, "I know."

380
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:43,021
And shut the door in his face.

381
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:48,293
George... OFFICER:<i> Wait!!</i>

382
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:51,129
Wait!! We have to stomp
out the rebellion.

383
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:52,263
<i>Please!!</i> Smite it.

384
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:55,834
No!!! Shut the door on it.

385
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:57,869
George, okay.

386
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:58,937
Wait!!

387
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:00,405
It's in the wagon!

388
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:06,411
Under the seat.

389
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:17,055
Welcome to The Saint's
restoration of the Union

390
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:19,324
and the final annihilation
of the Confederacy.

391
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:22,160
<i>Saddle up, boys!</i>

392
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:26,031
George, the door.

393
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:50,088
John...

394
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:53,892
I finally get to fix my mistake.

395
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,363
<i>This</i> is a mistake.

396
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:03,435
My two against all of them?

397
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:05,370
Well, four.

398
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,040
There's four, actually.

399
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,079
My boys... both of you?

400
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:21,086
Well, trouble halved
is trouble shared.

401
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:26,024
Don't sally me, John.

402
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,859
I'm not your deputy.

403
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:30,929
Look me in the eye.

404
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,902
You've been dodging
bullets your whole life.

405
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:41,072
And now I can't help but feel
you're stepping right into one.

406
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:48,379
When you show a man mercy

407
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:50,482
it becomes your responsibility.

408
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:56,955
Surely there's someone
else who can do this.

409
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:01,860
No.

410
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:05,130
I<i> have</i> to do this, Bonnie.

411
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,934
No, you don't.

412
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:14,239
You<i> want</i> to.

413
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:17,408
And if you fail, that'll be why.

414
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,246
Bonnie...

415
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:49,474
<i>Go back, retreat!</i>

416
00:29:49,476 --> 00:29:52,443
<i>Retreat, that's it boys,</i>
keep it moving!

417
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,078
<i>We've got 'em on the run!</i>

418
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,485
I got one!

419
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:30,915
That's enough for today, son.

420
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,519
Cal...

421
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:50,535
<i>Hold up, son.</i>

422
00:30:50,537 --> 00:30:52,503
Stand guard.

423
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:07,919
Jackpot.

424
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:12,590
This gold watch will
fetch a pretty penny.

425
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:19,664
Maybe I'll even give
it to you, son.

426
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,299
Come on, dad, stop.

427
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:23,201
What?

428
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:24,936
You've taken enough.

429
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:26,537
No!!

430
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:33,478
Perkins.

431
00:31:57,604 --> 00:31:59,570
<i>Cal, stand guard.</i>

432
00:32:15,322 --> 00:32:18,356
Virgil, I'm so sorry.

433
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:40,745
I never should've brought him.

434
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:45,016
<i>He fought for</i>
a good cause, Virgil.

435
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:47,352
With honor.

436
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:50,588
He fought because I made him.

437
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,292
He's dead because I brought him.

438
00:32:54,294 --> 00:32:56,194
It should've been his brother.

439
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:00,765
But<i> he</i> was there.

440
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:03,167
And that's what matters.

441
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:05,003
The cause was affected
for the good because

442
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:06,404
your son was part of it.

443
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:08,706
And history will remember.

444
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:12,110
The cause... History...

445
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:17,448
He came for the adventure.

446
00:33:19,386 --> 00:33:22,120
I came to kill traitors.

447
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:29,160
I'll bring you home, boy.

448
00:33:29,162 --> 00:33:33,297
Lay you next to your
mother soon enough.

449
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:38,269
As soon as I get that gray
back that murdered you.

450
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:40,338
I'll kill him, boy.

451
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:46,677
I'll...

452
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,280
I'll have justice.

453
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:51,182
<i>Virgil...</i>

454
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:54,285
that ain't justice.

455
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:57,455
Red feather in his cap.

456
00:33:57,457 --> 00:34:01,259
Cocky, taunting red feather.

457
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:03,661
I'll... find him.

458
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:10,368
I'll find him if I have to
pillage the whole rebel army.

459
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,671
Grieve him, Virgil,
fight for him.

460
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:16,707
But don't dishonor
him with revenge.

461
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,317
Who up and made you preacher?

462
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:30,755
Look who you're talking to.

463
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,557
Look where I'm standing!

464
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:37,862
Your boy knew what was right...

465
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:40,098
he would've killed that Johnny.

466
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,300
But you stopped him.

467
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:47,338
My boy's dead because
<i>you</i> stopped that bullet.

468
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,141
His blood cries for revenge!

469
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:55,213
Maybe it's yours that
should be taken.

470
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:56,714
Hold it, Buge.

471
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:01,185
Virgil...

472
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:04,255
<i>Dad...</i>

473
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:05,623
<i>It's alright, Cal.</i>

474
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,168
I'm sorry boy.

475
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:28,446
Take it.

476
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:30,648
He'd want you to...

477
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,316
keep practicing.

478
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:10,855
You're pretty good at
that tin sandwich.

479
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,427
You think if Perkins was
still alive The Saint

480
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:18,229
would've turned out the same?

481
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:21,866
I think The Saint was broke
before the war even started.

482
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:24,869
There was bad brewing
in him for a long time.

483
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,406
I think when his son
died, that dam broke.

484
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:33,978
No, I don't think
The Saint's son was bad.

485
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,882
But I think the father would've
forced him there eventually.

486
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:41,986
You see, daddies have a way
of doing those things.

487
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:44,789
Shaping a thing.

488
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,924
So you shaped me, huh?

489
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:48,926
<i>Well, not to the</i>
caliber that you've become.

490
00:36:48,928 --> 00:36:52,363
But I think mama and me,
we lit some kindling.

491
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:57,301
But you stoked that fire
all by yourself,<i> senator.</i>

492
00:36:57,303 --> 00:36:58,836
Oh, I know. Come on...

493
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:02,974
Oh, well, war hero.

494
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:05,943
Law school, marshal.

495
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:09,647
Going after the number one
criminal this side of the Ohio.

496
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:12,316
Dad. You haven't shown
any interest in.

497
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:14,986
The Saint till it caught
the eye of Washington.

498
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:17,421
I ain't condemning you,
I get it.

499
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:18,990
Small potatoes.

500
00:37:18,992 --> 00:37:22,326
But let this be a lesson to you.

501
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:26,564
Small things, grow.

502
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:28,466
Let's just worry about
getting The Saint.

503
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:32,003
We'll think about
the becomings, after.

504
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,638
I can't help but wonder
what it would've been like

505
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,539
if I hadn't let him go.

506
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,275
Well, he was your friend.

507
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:39,410
No, he wasn't.

508
00:37:39,412 --> 00:37:43,314
Just because you know a man
doesn't make him your friend.

509
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:52,323
What was the story
with that fence post?

510
00:37:57,063 --> 00:37:58,729
Good night, Cal.

511
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:00,931
Good night! Good night.

512
00:38:38,371 --> 00:38:40,905
I<i> will</i> be back.

513
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:42,640
Both of you.

514
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:46,777
Hyah, hyah!

515
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:16,600
The Saint stole
our food, stole our lives.

516
00:40:16,602 --> 00:40:20,438
<i>And this reward will</i>
give it all back!

517
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,575
<i>I want you to think of your</i>
wives; Think about your sister.

518
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:26,043
Think about your children.

519
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:30,214
This time tomorrow,
our problems are over!

520
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:33,451
This time tomorrow there'll be
justice for our fallen brothers.

521
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:34,652
That's right!

522
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:36,754
This time tomorrow
we'll be rich!

523
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:41,125
Kill him, hang him dead.

524
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:43,761
Somebody gets between
you and The Saint...

525
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:46,197
They're standin' between
you and your family,

526
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,166
you and your lives!

527
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,502
Let's fight for the fallen!

528
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:52,837
Let's ride!

529
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:54,171
<i>Let's make some money.</i>

530
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:55,539
<i>Alright, let's get him.</i>

531
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,574
<i>Saddle up boys!</i>

532
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,808
<i>Yeah, let's go!</i>

533
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:15,092
What you readin'?

534
00:41:15,094 --> 00:41:17,695
Nothin'.

535
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:19,163
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

536
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,167
<i>Sonnets.</i> Who?

537
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:25,903
Shakespeare.

538
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:28,839
Shakespeare?

539
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:30,674
Poetry.

540
00:41:32,211 --> 00:41:36,247
Oh... Huh.

541
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:38,549
<i>You know...</i>

542
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:40,050
I wrote a poem once.

543
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,222
What, you? JOHN:<i> Uh-huh.</i>

544
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:47,157
When I first met your mama.

545
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:54,198
Wow, I am surprised
I was even born.

546
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,768
Yeah, I can be artistic
too when I want to be.

547
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,937
Yeah.

548
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:01,839
With a fence post.

549
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:03,941
You're lucky I'm layin' down!

550
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:06,010
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:07,745
My watch.

552
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:09,713
<i>Sleep tight, boys. Night.</i>

553
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:22,726
Mama know?

554
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:23,861
What, about the sonnets?

555
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:25,796
About the<i> girl.</i>

556
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:28,032
I would feel like picking with
the barrage of questions

557
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:30,067
she would come at me with.

558
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,236
No, I have not told anybody.

559
00:42:32,238 --> 00:42:35,873
You know, new canteens
are cheap.

560
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:39,176
So is life.

561
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:41,879
Yours was almost bought
with a tiny piece of lead.

562
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:45,316
Old things like this always
remind me to pray

563
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:47,217
for the better angels.

564
00:42:50,189 --> 00:42:51,789
Get some sleep.

565
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:54,892
Nothing gets past ol' Buge.

566
00:42:54,894 --> 00:42:57,127
I don't think I've ever
seen him sleep a wink.

567
00:42:57,129 --> 00:43:00,598
I bet he would stay out there
all night if you asked him to.

568
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:05,002
Looks all quiet to me.

569
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:11,241
Shanks, how long have you
been marshaling for?

570
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:14,111
Since the war.

571
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:16,180
What made you choose<i> this</i>
line of work?

572
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:17,715
Best legal way to
keep the juices flowing,

573
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:19,316
I suppose.

574
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:21,085
It's kinda hard to go back to
being a clerk

575
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,854
once you've dealt in bullets,
know what I mean?

576
00:43:29,261 --> 00:43:31,395
Yeah.

577
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:33,397
I suppose I do.

578
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:35,799
My dad did.

579
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:38,202
He went right back behind the
counter selling

580
00:43:38,204 --> 00:43:41,372
pickled eggs and candy sticks.

581
00:43:41,374 --> 00:43:43,374
I couldn't though.

582
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:50,881
You know there are two types of
men who come in and out of war.

583
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:55,919
Those who fight because
it's their duty like your daddy.

584
00:43:55,921 --> 00:44:00,958
Then go home and shed the
memories with their uniform.

585
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,762
<i>And then there are those who</i>
fight because they're fighters,

586
00:44:04,764 --> 00:44:07,297
and there's always something
that needs to be fought.

587
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:11,835
It takes both types.

588
00:44:17,076 --> 00:44:18,909
Good night boys.

589
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:46,770
Hyah! Hyah!

590
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:05,289
We're getting pretty deep
into Kansas now boys.

591
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:07,891
Are you sure you know
where The Saint is?

592
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:10,060
Just relax back there, old man.

593
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,766
The trail leads<i> that</i> way.

594
00:45:15,768 --> 00:45:17,901
But that's towards the
Abington place.

595
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:19,403
Why would they go through
the Abington place?

596
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:20,971
Something ain't right.

597
00:45:20,973 --> 00:45:22,339
I'm gonna go check it out.

598
00:45:22,341 --> 00:45:23,974
- Cal!
- Hyah!

599
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:30,314
Ah... stubborn.

600
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:36,954
Something wrong, Sheriff?

601
00:45:40,526 --> 00:45:42,292
Your daddy used to
get these feelings

602
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:47,297
before a battle or a march,
you know about those?

603
00:45:47,299 --> 00:45:50,200
Yeah, I get 'em at
home too when something's off,

604
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:53,403
or about to happen.

605
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:55,205
How are you feeling?

606
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:01,278
Like we're being watched.

607
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,313
Uh-huh... yeah.

608
00:46:05,985 --> 00:46:08,886
I missed your daddy the last
couple of years.

609
00:46:08,888 --> 00:46:10,821
Yeah, I miss him too.

610
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,826
He talked about you all
the time during the war.

611
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:20,003
It was hard for him
fighting against ya.

612
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:25,903
Every prisoner we'd catch, he'd
always ask them if they knew ya.

613
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:31,375
It's an honor ridin' with ya.

614
00:46:31,377 --> 00:46:32,810
I hope I don't
disappoint you, sir.

615
00:46:32,812 --> 00:46:34,545
Nah, you won't.

616
00:46:37,216 --> 00:46:38,816
They're there.

617
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:40,317
And the Abingtons?

618
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,586
Fresh graves in the back.

619
00:46:42,588 --> 00:46:44,321
There's a girl.<i> JOHN: Abby?</i>

620
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,604
She was running water from the
well... she's alive.

621
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:52,362
So, this is it.

622
00:46:52,364 --> 00:46:55,365
You hang a man for
avenging his son?

623
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:58,569
What's the plan, Marshal?

624
00:46:58,571 --> 00:47:00,504
Ride around the tree line
and come around back,

625
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:02,272
and you cut their horses loose.

626
00:47:02,274 --> 00:47:05,342
If you see them run out,
give them light.

627
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:07,377
Bugle, stay just out of
the line of fire.

628
00:47:07,379 --> 00:47:09,379
If there's trouble,
run and get help.

629
00:47:11,183 --> 00:47:12,983
Sheriff.

630
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:17,120
Or we deliver the warrant.

631
00:47:17,122 --> 00:47:21,158
Hup! Hyah!

632
00:47:38,911 --> 00:47:40,577
Company.

633
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:44,648
<i>My name is Cal Breaker,</i>
and I am a U.S. Marshal.

634
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:48,252
Howdy.

635
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:50,487
<i>Is Mr. Abington here?</i>

636
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:53,357
Yeah, he's around.

637
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,892
One of the...

638
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:56,393
<i>twins</i> could take you to him.

639
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:59,196
Heh.

640
00:47:59,198 --> 00:48:02,232
<i>Easy, Cal.</i>

641
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:06,063
You ever grab a
rattler by the nose?

642
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:11,975
Grab those reins,
and you'll find out.

643
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:13,944
<i>That's right.</i>

644
00:48:13,946 --> 00:48:17,214
You're in no position to
make threats, law dog.

645
00:48:17,216 --> 00:48:19,283
Virgil!

646
00:48:19,285 --> 00:48:21,685
Virgil, come on out!

647
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:33,230
John Breaker.

648
00:48:35,634 --> 00:48:37,301
Virg.

649
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:42,940
It always makes me smile
to see you, John.

650
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:45,208
I wish I felt the same, Virg.

651
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,643
The last time I saw you,

652
00:48:46,645 --> 00:48:48,712
you were fitting me for a noose.

653
00:48:48,714 --> 00:48:50,634
If memory serves,
you deserved it.

654
00:48:55,187 --> 00:48:57,254
Are you here to see the uh...

655
00:48:57,256 --> 00:48:58,655
<i>Abingtons.</i>

656
00:49:00,326 --> 00:49:04,394
Yeah, are you here to see them?
Because they ain't here.

657
00:49:04,396 --> 00:49:06,096
Hmm.

658
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:13,036
Looks like you made
yourself at home.

659
00:49:13,038 --> 00:49:14,972
I know you ain't here on
official business,

660
00:49:14,974 --> 00:49:17,641
because last time I checked,
the state line ended over yonder

661
00:49:17,643 --> 00:49:20,077
and so does your jurisdiction.

662
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,545
Mine did...

663
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:23,280
<i>his</i> didn't.

664
00:49:25,651 --> 00:49:27,284
Cal?

665
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:29,052
Virgil.

666
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:30,120
Well...

667
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:31,555
this boy he...

668
00:49:31,557 --> 00:49:34,224
he was friends with
my boy during the war.

669
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:35,625
It's good to see you, Cal.

670
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:36,994
It's "Marshal" now.

671
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:40,497
Marshal?

672
00:49:43,102 --> 00:49:47,504
Good for you, good for you, heh.

673
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:49,473
<i>What can I do for you, Marshal?</i>

674
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:51,541
We have got a warrant
for your arrest.

675
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:56,246
Yeah?

676
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:59,282
I don't think so, Cal.

677
00:49:59,284 --> 00:50:02,185
It's nice of you
boys to stop by.

678
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:03,754
Goodbye, John.

679
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:07,324
We ain't goin' without ya, Virg.

680
00:50:07,326 --> 00:50:10,527
Trouble's coming and it's
got your name all over it.

681
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:14,031
Wouldn't you rather see this
through with some friends?

682
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,599
Are we still friends, John?

683
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:21,405
We can do this easy, Virg.

684
00:50:21,407 --> 00:50:22,773
Ain't nothin' easy.

685
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:29,586
Bugle still fighting
your wars for you?

686
00:50:31,383 --> 00:50:32,449
Holt!

687
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:40,223
She makes a<i> mean</i> cobbler.

688
00:50:44,496 --> 00:50:46,463
Are you okay, Abby?

689
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:55,172
What are the odds
of you knowing them?

690
00:50:55,174 --> 00:50:57,641
They used to live just
north of Linn Creek.

691
00:50:57,643 --> 00:50:59,709
<i>- Well, then...</i>
- Get, get, get!

692
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,245
I guess you already
know all about the cobbler.

693
00:51:03,749 --> 00:51:06,516
Now as much as I like
cobbler, Virg...

694
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:08,752
you know how Bonnie gets
if I ruin her dinner.

695
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:13,523
Pace you're marchin, ya gonna
miss more than supper.

696
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:16,359
It's more than you'll get hangin
from a bushwhacker's tree.

697
00:51:16,361 --> 00:51:19,362
Their trees or your gallows,
it makes no difference to me.
Listen, Virg-

698
00:51:19,364 --> 00:51:21,431
No<i> you</i> listen, John!

699
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:24,201
<i>You take your Marshal-boy,</i>
and you go across that line.

700
00:51:24,203 --> 00:51:25,802
And you forget you ever knew me!

701
00:51:25,804 --> 00:51:28,438
Not his call, it's mine.

702
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:32,309
Back a bear in his own den,
boy...

703
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:34,111
you'll find out what happens.

704
00:51:34,113 --> 00:51:37,647
I know what happens...
you smoke him out.

705
00:51:41,386 --> 00:51:43,787
<i>We were brothers once.</i>

706
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:45,889
<i>I'm gonna give you</i>
one last chance.

707
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:47,858
<i>Take your boy home.</i>

708
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,694
Don't make the same
mistake I did.

709
00:51:50,696 --> 00:51:51,828
Holt!

710
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,164
Tucker!

711
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:54,798
Hey. JOHN:<i> Cal.</i>

712
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,500
Hey! Hey!

713
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:58,902
- Cal, don't.
- - Hey!

714
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:15,585
Everybody stop.

715
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:18,222
Aw, heck.

716
00:52:26,899 --> 00:52:28,431
Hyah!

717
00:53:28,527 --> 00:53:29,993
Yah!

718
00:54:18,543 --> 00:54:20,377
Fence post!

719
00:54:20,379 --> 00:54:22,912
Yah!

720
00:54:32,924 --> 00:54:34,924
Gentle justice.

721
00:54:56,648 --> 00:54:57,947
They got Bugle!

722
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:02,052
Did he hit the ground?

723
00:55:02,054 --> 00:55:05,655
<i>- What?</i>
- Did he fall from his horse?

724
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:07,524
<i>No.</i>

725
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:15,098
Ah!

726
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:50,867
Cal!!!

727
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:55,739
Cal, go! Go!

728
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:01,511
Go, Cal! Go!

729
00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:06,816
Go, go! Get in! You ain't gonna
bring 'em back

730
00:56:06,818 --> 00:56:08,084
doing stuff like that!

731
00:56:08,086 --> 00:56:10,120
<i>They got Shanks.</i>

732
00:56:10,122 --> 00:56:11,454
Ain't nothin' you can
do about that right now.

733
00:56:11,456 --> 00:56:12,589
<i>They killed him.</i>

734
00:56:12,591 --> 00:56:13,857
We all knew the risks.

735
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:16,960
What kind of excuse is that?

736
00:56:16,962 --> 00:56:19,095
Cal!

737
00:56:19,097 --> 00:56:20,697
He died fighting for a cause.

738
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:22,165
That's all any fighter
can ever ask for.

739
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:23,933
You going back out there and
getting yourself killed

740
00:56:23,935 --> 00:56:25,735
ain't gonna help him now.

741
00:56:25,737 --> 00:56:28,638
How about Bugle?
He was your friend.

742
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,474
You said he didn't fall off
his horse, right?

743
00:56:31,476 --> 00:56:32,642
<i>Yeah.</i>

744
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:34,511
I know my friend.

745
00:56:38,784 --> 00:56:41,985
You should have killed
Virgil when you had the chance.

746
00:56:41,987 --> 00:56:44,421
<i>Well let me</i>
<i>tell</i>
ya what redemption looks like...

747
00:56:44,423 --> 00:56:46,756
<i>I never found you,</i>
and I never see you again.

748
00:56:46,758 --> 00:56:49,859
You go West and start yourself
a new life, Virgil.

749
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:51,428
You ready to move?

750
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:57,500
We gotta hold up until
we get reinforcements.

751
00:56:57,502 --> 00:56:59,536
How long is that gonna be?

752
00:56:59,538 --> 00:57:01,971
Well, it'll take Bugle 2 hours
to get to town;

753
00:57:01,973 --> 00:57:05,442
2 hours to posse up and about 5
hours to get back in the dark.

754
00:57:05,444 --> 00:57:06,843
So until dawn?

755
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:09,145
I ain't waitin' that long.

756
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:22,525
<i>- Hey Breaker... Breaker.</i>
- Yeah?

757
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:23,960
We've got trouble.

758
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,730
Yeah.

759
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:32,735
He left last night
right past the pickets.

760
00:57:35,006 --> 00:57:37,907
<i>They're calling him a deserter.</i>

761
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:40,009
We both know what he went to do.

762
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,948
The Captain's looking for him.

763
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,870
They'll want me to
bring him back.

764
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:51,120
He who walks with the wise
becomes wise,

765
00:57:51,122 --> 00:57:53,122
but a companion to fools
suffers harm.

766
00:57:56,862 --> 00:57:59,863
They're gonna hang him,
aren't they, dad?

767
00:57:59,865 --> 00:58:03,500
I know why me, but why<i> you?</i>

768
00:58:07,172 --> 00:58:08,771
Foolish or wise...

769
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:13,276
I'm your companion.

770
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:16,579
Here's to harm.

771
00:58:18,183 --> 00:58:20,683
I'm comin' with ya.

772
00:58:21,253 --> 00:58:22,752
Not this time.

773
00:58:23,955 --> 00:58:25,088
Dad?

774
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,857
You're staying. It's safer here.

775
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:30,660
But it's not safe anywhere,
and I wanna be with you.

776
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:32,762
I said you're staying.

777
00:58:32,764 --> 00:58:34,898
If you die for your country,
so be it.

778
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,100
But I'm not letting you die
for The Saint.

779
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:39,903
Let's go.

780
00:58:49,714 --> 00:58:51,614
<i>They got us pinned, Cal.</i>

781
00:58:51,616 --> 00:58:53,883
<i>Looks like we're staying</i>
here tonight.

782
00:58:55,921 --> 00:58:58,922
Heya... do you think
they'll run?

783
00:58:58,924 --> 00:59:00,590
No.

784
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:02,559
<i>Do you think they'll</i>
hurt the girl?

785
00:59:05,096 --> 00:59:06,930
I don't know.

786
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:14,604
Shh.

787
00:59:21,947 --> 00:59:24,347
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

788
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:31,287
Hey!

789
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:35,658
I hit him, you cuff him.

790
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:43,099
This is that
jayhawker Jeremiah's outpost.

791
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:45,768
<i>I'll see who sneaks up on</i>
who this time.

792
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:01,884
<i>Turn back. Go home.</i>

793
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:03,119
Under whose authority?

794
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,321
Mine.

795
01:00:05,323 --> 01:00:08,725
The Marshal done warned you
with his mouth.

796
01:00:08,727 --> 01:00:12,395
Now I'm warning you with my gun.

797
01:00:12,397 --> 01:00:14,831
It's just you, huh?

798
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,700
Look at you sittin' there all
fancy pointin' your pistol

799
01:00:17,702 --> 01:00:22,405
at me while The Saint
runs free starving my kids.

800
01:00:22,407 --> 01:00:24,107
Raiding my land.

801
01:00:25,377 --> 01:00:27,010
I'm gonna count to three.

802
01:00:29,914 --> 01:00:31,314
One...

803
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:36,686
Two...

804
01:00:45,063 --> 01:00:46,229
Three.

805
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:58,708
<i>Grab his horse.</i>

806
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,044
<i>We'll get to the Abington Ranch</i>
before sundown.

807
01:01:08,286 --> 01:01:09,786
There ya go.

808
01:01:09,788 --> 01:01:11,220
The Saint's gonna get you!

809
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,258
No, he's not.

810
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:18,728
Watch her.

811
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,731
<i>Make sure she doesn't move.</i>

812
01:01:33,411 --> 01:01:34,911
Hey, John!

813
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:38,114
What?

814
01:01:38,116 --> 01:01:41,250
I'm giving you the one last
chance you once gave me.

815
01:01:41,252 --> 01:01:46,222
<i>You can leave here now,</i>
and I'll let you go.

816
01:01:46,224 --> 01:01:48,091
With you in tow?

817
01:01:48,093 --> 01:01:51,227
You're a stubborn man.

818
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:53,863
Yep.

819
01:01:53,865 --> 01:01:56,332
So what'll it be?

820
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:01,370
I'll wait.

821
01:02:03,341 --> 01:02:05,475
To meet your maker?

822
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:08,745
Maybe.

823
01:02:25,764 --> 01:02:27,764
If we're gonna meet our maker...

824
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:30,299
it's not gonna be
from starvation.

825
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:33,469
<i>We've got their provisions,</i>
take a look.

826
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:41,978
Looks like a dadgum
general store in here let's eat!

827
01:02:45,517 --> 01:02:47,383
<i>John Breaker.</i>

828
01:02:47,385 --> 01:02:48,818
Look, why don't we just run?

829
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,219
<i>They ain't gonna catch us!</i>

830
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:51,320
Because of what's in the barn.

831
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:52,488
There's always more loot, boss.

832
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,191
Not the loot... Breaker!

833
01:02:55,193 --> 01:02:57,794
We can get away and
regroup and gather more men.

834
01:02:57,796 --> 01:02:59,362
This ends<i> today.</i>

835
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:01,564
I don't see no point in going
out there to die.

836
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:06,228
Do you wanna spend your life
lookin' over your shoulder?

837
01:03:13,077 --> 01:03:14,477
You ready?

838
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,213
Aye.

839
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:21,417
If she moves, kill her.

840
01:03:21,419 --> 01:03:23,386
<i>You got it, boss.</i>

841
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,467
Hey, hey... what is that?

842
01:03:40,972 --> 01:03:43,072
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

843
01:03:43,074 --> 01:03:45,341
Is she pretty as your mama?

844
01:03:45,343 --> 01:03:47,276
She's beautiful.

845
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:52,215
You live a dangerous life son,
is she okay with that?

846
01:03:52,217 --> 01:03:53,249
Yeah, she's fine.

847
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:01,157
Well.

848
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:03,593
We both know that mom
is a strong woman...

849
01:04:05,897 --> 01:04:11,434
but my life and my choices
haven't always been easy on her.

850
01:04:11,436 --> 01:04:14,103
A lot of late nights wonderin'
if I was comin' home on a saddle

851
01:04:14,105 --> 01:04:17,607
or in a box.

852
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:20,409
She's fine.

853
01:04:20,411 --> 01:04:23,880
Cal!

854
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:43,900
<i>Are you alright?</i>

855
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:45,167
Yeah, no holes.

856
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:48,004
<i>Desperation?</i>

857
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:49,338
Diversion.

858
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:54,243
Anvil's on the run.

859
01:04:54,245 --> 01:04:56,445
You take the back,
I'll take the front.

860
01:04:56,447 --> 01:04:58,581
Ready? Go!

861
01:05:21,673 --> 01:05:24,473
John Breaker...

862
01:05:24,475 --> 01:05:28,044
the only man alive who could
give my boss the quickstep.

863
01:05:28,046 --> 01:05:30,179
Tucker Macready...

864
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:32,348
don't make me shoot a musician;

865
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,117
The world needs as
many as it can get.

866
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,385
I believe I got you-

867
01:06:03,414 --> 01:06:05,448
There's always another way.

868
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:09,051
Really?

869
01:06:09,053 --> 01:06:10,419
Always?

870
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:12,321
How've you been?

871
01:06:14,292 --> 01:06:17,393
I've been busy.

872
01:06:17,395 --> 01:06:18,694
Come here.

873
01:06:26,237 --> 01:06:27,703
The Saint is gonna kill you.

874
01:06:27,705 --> 01:06:30,406
I heard that one already.

875
01:06:43,054 --> 01:06:45,454
Is this your idea
of gentle justice?

876
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:51,193
Dad, hey this is the girl
I was telling you about.

877
01:06:51,195 --> 01:06:52,428
Stacey Snyder.

878
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,497
<i>I've heard a lot about you, sir.</i>

879
01:06:54,499 --> 01:06:56,065
She works for the government.

880
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:58,187
Her intel is what helped us get
the warrant.

881
01:06:59,303 --> 01:07:02,371
And you're...
you're okay with her being a...

882
01:07:02,373 --> 01:07:03,305
Spy?

883
01:07:03,307 --> 01:07:04,240
No offense, sheriff-

884
01:07:04,242 --> 01:07:05,641
Deputy.

885
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:07,176
No offense.

886
01:07:07,178 --> 01:07:08,778
I've been working southern
celebrations

887
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,581
and Confederate inaugurations
since before Sumter.

888
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,784
Your mama's gonna love her!

889
01:07:16,387 --> 01:07:18,154
What if I had shot her?!

890
01:07:18,156 --> 01:07:19,722
Now come on,
you're not gonna shoot a girl.

891
01:07:19,724 --> 01:07:21,190
You can hardly look at her.

892
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,228
Alright, you two
lovebirds... let's end this.

893
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:28,270
<i>The Saint's not getting</i>
away this time.

894
01:07:34,705 --> 01:07:36,272
Alright...

895
01:07:36,274 --> 01:07:38,207
I'll busy him in the front.

896
01:07:38,209 --> 01:07:40,109
You go around left,
and come in through the back.

897
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:42,211
It'll be just like Bull Run.

898
01:07:42,213 --> 01:07:43,512
You ready, Miss Snyder?

899
01:07:43,514 --> 01:07:45,214
<i>Yep.</i> JOHN: Ready, son?

900
01:07:45,216 --> 01:07:46,082
Ready.

901
01:07:46,084 --> 01:07:47,416
Good.

902
01:07:54,725 --> 01:07:57,326
The odds have shifted, Virgil.

903
01:07:57,328 --> 01:08:00,763
You're outnumbered.
How do you wanna play it?

904
01:08:00,765 --> 01:08:03,766
I'm glad it's you, John...
but you're gonna have to

905
01:08:03,768 --> 01:08:06,202
kill me this time.

906
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:51,614
Oh! Morning, boys.

907
01:08:55,453 --> 01:08:57,186
Was it worth it, Virg?

908
01:08:59,357 --> 01:09:02,358
I'm glad it's you
they sent, John.

909
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,926
I'm not.

910
01:09:14,906 --> 01:09:18,207
I lost my boy, John.

911
01:09:18,209 --> 01:09:21,243
<i>It's got to count for something.</i>

912
01:09:21,245 --> 01:09:23,579
You've got a boy.

913
01:09:23,581 --> 01:09:25,714
You understand.

914
01:09:25,716 --> 01:09:27,283
<i>They'll understand.</i>

915
01:09:27,285 --> 01:09:29,385
You disobeyed orders.

916
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:30,786
<i>You left without leave.</i>

917
01:09:30,788 --> 01:09:33,189
<i>You put yourself above the Army.</i>

918
01:09:33,191 --> 01:09:34,690
That's called desertion.

919
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:35,691
It was justice!

920
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:38,294
It was war!

921
01:09:38,296 --> 01:09:40,596
<i>How many sons did you take</i>
in Petersburg?

922
01:09:40,598 --> 01:09:42,965
How about Bull Run?

923
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:44,300
While you were out there
trying to even the score,

924
01:09:44,302 --> 01:09:45,701
you put a price on all of us.

925
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:46,902
Oh, it's easy for you
to talk like that.

926
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:48,871
Your boy is still breathing.

927
01:09:48,873 --> 01:09:51,540
And you stayed the bullet
that killed mine.

928
01:09:51,542 --> 01:09:53,309
<i>If it had been your boy</i>
that had been buried,

929
01:09:53,311 --> 01:09:55,911
<i>I'd have understood.</i>

930
01:09:55,913 --> 01:09:57,780
<i>Help! Someone shot Timmy!</i>

931
01:09:57,782 --> 01:09:59,942
I guess I was followed;
Your choice... fight or flight?

932
01:10:01,652 --> 01:10:03,419
They've gotta be close.

933
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:04,987
Over here! I see them!

934
01:10:07,325 --> 01:10:09,858
Go!

935
01:10:31,415 --> 01:10:32,948
Go, Cal! Go!

936
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:39,622
You're late.

937
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:41,290
I thought you said
like Bull Run?

938
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:42,725
You were late then too.

939
01:10:42,727 --> 01:10:45,828
I'm coming out!

940
01:10:50,968 --> 01:10:54,603
It's over, Virg... let her go.

941
01:10:54,605 --> 01:10:57,773
You're in no position
to negotiate.

942
01:10:57,775 --> 01:10:59,775
You're gonna kill
an innocent girl?

943
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:01,910
I'll do what I have to
to protect the Union.

944
01:11:01,912 --> 01:11:04,346
No, you'll do what you have to
for<i> revenge.</i>

945
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:06,448
Their treachery is unforgivable!

946
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:08,817
No, you think
your son abandoning

947
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:10,953
you is unforgivable.

948
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:14,290
You think the war taking your
other boy is unforgivable.

949
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:16,458
Put your guns down!

950
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,560
- I'll shoot her.
- You're not gonna shoot her
Virg.

951
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:19,728
She doesn't deserve it.

952
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:36,078
You're broken...

953
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,514
and you're bad...

954
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:40,082
but you ain't evil, Virg.

955
01:11:42,987 --> 01:11:44,620
Let her go.

956
01:11:47,658 --> 01:11:50,025
You're right.

957
01:11:50,027 --> 01:11:51,794
<i>I won't shoot her.</i>

958
01:11:57,335 --> 01:12:00,536
Drop it! Drop it!
The traitor too!

959
01:12:00,538 --> 01:12:03,505
<i>Good girl.</i>

960
01:12:03,507 --> 01:12:04,740
Put your gun down.

961
01:12:04,742 --> 01:12:06,041
Put your gun down!

962
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:19,855
A son for a son.

963
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:21,724
Now you know what it feels like.

964
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:25,594
Cal!

965
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:28,864
Take it easy... easy.
Are you okay?

966
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:34,670
Howdy.

967
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,847
We's here for a reckonin'.

968
01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:51,053
Ah, ah, ah... drop it.

969
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:00,496
Cal, keep your finger in it.

970
01:13:00,498 --> 01:13:01,730
We don't want ya to bleed out.

971
01:13:01,732 --> 01:13:04,032
Dad, I'm fine.

972
01:13:09,106 --> 01:13:10,572
Stay with him.

973
01:13:10,574 --> 01:13:11,840
What?

974
01:13:11,842 --> 01:13:13,475
I said stay with him.

975
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:19,481
<i>Where is he?</i>

976
01:13:20,151 --> 01:13:21,850
Ah!

977
01:13:21,852 --> 01:13:25,053
Whoa now.
That man is ours, sheriff.

978
01:13:25,055 --> 01:13:27,022
I've got a warrant
for this man's arrest.

979
01:13:40,771 --> 01:13:43,172
Oh, that had to hurt!

980
01:13:51,649 --> 01:13:52,881
Oh!

981
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,026
Alright, let's wrap it up, boys.

982
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:12,234
I said he's ours, sheriff.

983
01:14:25,049 --> 01:14:27,583
Do it!

984
01:14:27,585 --> 01:14:29,084
Kill me.

985
01:14:29,086 --> 01:14:32,187
Dead or alive,
it don't matter to us.

986
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:35,157
You heard 'em...
kill me!

987
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:38,694
John, kill me.

988
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:43,932
I shot your son.

989
01:14:52,776 --> 01:14:55,110
So this is it?

990
01:14:55,112 --> 01:14:58,213
Hang a man for avenging his son?

991
01:14:58,215 --> 01:15:00,215
Well, from where I'm
standing you get two

992
01:15:00,217 --> 01:15:04,152
choices... the reckoning,
or the redemption.

993
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:07,189
The reckoning?

994
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:10,592
The reckoning is what that Reb
got for murdering my boy.

995
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:12,895
Well let me tell you what
redemption looks like...

996
01:15:12,897 --> 01:15:15,697
I never found you,
and I never see you again.

997
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:18,834
<i>You go West and you start</i>
yourself a new life, Virgil.

998
01:15:18,836 --> 01:15:21,537
I'll give it to ya
if you'll take it.

999
01:15:23,641 --> 01:15:25,007
So you're judge and jury?

1000
01:15:25,009 --> 01:15:26,909
<i>And executioner.</i>

1001
01:15:26,911 --> 01:15:28,544
They told me don't bother
bringing you back,

1002
01:15:28,546 --> 01:15:32,214
just find a tree and drop you.

1003
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:34,983
<i>But I know something</i>
they don't...

1004
01:15:34,985 --> 01:15:38,687
you deserted,
but you're not a deserter.

1005
01:15:38,689 --> 01:15:39,988
You're just selfish.

1006
01:15:42,293 --> 01:15:47,129
So... there's two roads.

1007
01:15:47,131 --> 01:15:49,197
The easy one is the reckoning.

1008
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,966
The right one is redemption.

1009
01:15:53,037 --> 01:15:54,636
What's it gonna be, Virg?

1010
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,193
You're under arrest.

1011
01:16:18,195 --> 01:16:19,895
The court will decide your fate.

1012
01:16:19,897 --> 01:16:21,897
Mercy?!

1013
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:26,301
I spared you once because of
pity... mercy?

1014
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,208
Ain't nothin' gentle
about mercy.

1015
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:36,278
Go on, I'm taking him in.

1016
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,381
You're outside your
jurisdiction, sheriff.

1017
01:16:39,383 --> 01:16:41,617
You ain't nothin' but
a man outgunned.

1018
01:16:45,155 --> 01:16:47,990
You're on the wrong side
of justice, boys.

1019
01:16:47,992 --> 01:16:50,959
Don't test me; Not today.

1020
01:16:50,961 --> 01:16:52,761
Oh yeah?
Whatcha gonna do?

1021
01:16:52,763 --> 01:16:56,999
Huh? Forgive us if
we don't oblige... come on.

1022
01:16:57,001 --> 01:16:59,034
Oh, I'll forgive ya...

1023
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:01,069
<i>after I'm done with ya.</i>

1024
01:17:06,744 --> 01:17:10,912
Heh... us versus you?

1025
01:17:10,914 --> 01:17:12,914
Andthem.

1026
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:20,722
<i>I got no problem taking you too.</i>

1027
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:23,659
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

1028
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:25,861
- Hyah!
- That's what I thought.

1029
01:17:35,305 --> 01:17:38,740
It's about time.

1030
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:42,044
Most men wouldn't
make it 'til dawn.

1031
01:17:42,046 --> 01:17:45,781
Well thankfully,
you ain't most men.

1032
01:17:45,783 --> 01:17:48,417
They shot a Deputy Marshal
on the road.

1033
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:51,219
<i>Do you want me to ride</i>
after them?

1034
01:17:51,221 --> 01:17:52,954
Send the boys.

1035
01:17:52,956 --> 01:17:54,723
Cal's been hit.

1036
01:17:58,429 --> 01:18:00,896
Get up.

1037
01:18:00,898 --> 01:18:02,998
Whoa.

1038
01:18:06,003 --> 01:18:07,769
Hold off.

1039
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:08,904
Move!

1040
01:18:08,906 --> 01:18:10,205
Not like this.

1041
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:15,077
I said not like this.

1042
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:18,380
My father... my brother...

1043
01:18:21,018 --> 01:18:22,017
Abby-

1044
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:23,452
You spared him!

1045
01:18:25,389 --> 01:18:29,758
Shh, he's going to court, Abby.
And this time he'll hang.

1046
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:33,328
Not this time.

1047
01:18:41,839 --> 01:18:45,173
Take him away, boys.

1048
01:18:53,283 --> 01:18:55,884
He deserved to hang.

1049
01:18:55,886 --> 01:18:57,819
I know.

1050
01:18:59,022 --> 01:19:01,289
<i>Then why didn't you?</i>

1051
01:19:01,291 --> 01:19:04,426
If it were<i> my</i> son who
were shot and killed...

1052
01:19:04,428 --> 01:19:07,763
I'd probably have done the same.

1053
01:19:13,537 --> 01:19:16,772
No, you wouldn't.

1054
01:19:33,423 --> 01:19:34,990
Look at you all gussied up

1055
01:19:34,992 --> 01:19:36,792
<i>from your court date!</i>

1056
01:19:36,794 --> 01:19:38,193
Bugle told me the verdict.

1057
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:39,327
Umm-hmm.

1058
01:19:39,329 --> 01:19:41,329
I got you this as a reminder...

1059
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:42,531
it's a little less morbid.

1060
01:19:47,805 --> 01:19:50,505
I like it.

1061
01:19:50,507 --> 01:19:52,374
You sure you don't wanna
stay a while longer?

1062
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:54,276
Well, I gotta get back to
Washington,

1063
01:19:54,278 --> 01:19:56,077
and report on The Saint's trial.

1064
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:59,314
Back to Washington.

1065
01:19:59,316 --> 01:20:01,883
We're proud of you.

1066
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:03,852
We did it.

1067
01:20:03,854 --> 01:20:05,854
Yes we did.

1068
01:20:05,856 --> 01:20:07,556
And it was a pleasure
getting to know you.

1069
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,591
The pleasure was mine, sheriff.

1070
01:20:11,361 --> 01:20:13,228
- Dad.
- What?

1071
01:20:15,265 --> 01:20:16,464
Wait what?

1072
01:20:16,466 --> 01:20:19,000
- Keep us posted!
- A wedding?

1073
01:20:19,002 --> 01:20:21,136
Don't wait too long.
Campaign season's coming.

1074
01:20:21,138 --> 01:20:22,404
What are you gonna do?
Run against me?

1075
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:23,939
Oh, I ought to just to have the

1076
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:26,241
pleasure of ordering
you around again.

1077
01:20:26,243 --> 01:20:28,076
Dad, you'll always be above my

1078
01:20:28,078 --> 01:20:29,911
rank in this county.

1079
01:20:34,117 --> 01:20:35,517
You take care of him.

1080
01:20:35,519 --> 01:20:37,152
We take care of each other.

1081
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:06,114
BUGLE, V/O:<i> There's a fight</i>
inside of men as well.

1082
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:08,216
<i>A fight against a reckoning.</i>

1083
01:21:10,587 --> 01:21:14,289
<i>A reckoning of all the</i>
things we've done...

1084
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,157
<i>or didn't do.</i>

1085
01:21:18,328 --> 01:21:20,629
<i>My granddaddy...</i>

1086
01:21:20,631 --> 01:21:22,330
<i>he called it a warrant.</i>

1087
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:27,269
<i>And he warns that</i>
at some point...

1088
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:29,204
<i>it hunts after us all.</i>

1089
01:21:31,275 --> 01:21:34,409
<i>Sometimes to reckon...</i>

1090
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:35,411
<i>always to redeem.</i>
