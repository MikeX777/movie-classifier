00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,670
THE FURY

2
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,084
<i>We nicknamed my aunt "Tiny Scrub".</i>

3
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:18,086
<i>But never said it to her herself.</i>

4
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,420
<i>Aunt Tiny got her cloths
from the humpback.</i>

5
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,754
<i>Handmade by the prison inmates.</i>

6
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:40,628
<i>If Aunt Tiny didn't like something,
she would be ruthless.</i>

7
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,043
<i>Once, when she was caught smoking...</i>

8
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,421
<i>she forgot that her apron
was man-made fibre.</i>

9
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,713
<i>Her experimental toothpaste
had been a free gift...</i>

10
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:14,340
<i>and she'd rather have inflamed gums
than throw half of it away.</i>

11
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:23,423
<i>My mother was Tinvs sister.
1 often stayed with my grandparents.</i>

12
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:27,590
<i>Aunt Tiny knew
lots of exciting stories.</i>

13
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:35,551
<i>Tiny was such a good liar
that she believed her own fibs.</i>

14
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:43,626
<i>Only years later I discovered
why she had such an odd character...</i>

15
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,176
<i>and what had motivated her
a“ her We.</i>

16
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,251
Tiny!

17
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,256
Tiny!

18
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:47,382
The slave is called to the job
but this slave stays in bed.

19
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,167
Let the tyrants make their own coffee.

20
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,254
Young Albert, where are you?

21
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,845
Do you know where Tiny is?

22
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,628
Must we discuss it again?
- We've never discussed it decently.

23
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:06,005
Talk decently about something indecent?
Not in front of the boy.

24
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:10,001
You go and see if grandpa's cigars
are in his coat pocket.

25
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,503
And if they're not,
go and find them upstairs.

26
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,965
And hurry up.

27
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,009
What you've done is so disgraceful,
there are no words for it.

28
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,053
I'll shout it from the roofs.
I do have words for it.

29
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,969
And you'll only be sorry.

30
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,840
You're not going to the funfair
and that's it.

31
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:31,178
You know no limits. You're staying in.

32
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,504
Hear me? I'll say it once more:
You're staying here.

33
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,753
No cigars.

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
So, you've got big plans I see.

35
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,294
I have to hand in my whole salary
to those slave drivers.

36
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,669
But what I earn this way, I keep.

37
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:14,089
Young Albert is staying with us.
He can help with the lacing.

38
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,500
Here...

39
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,548
Don't you want a boyfriend?

40
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,885
They're scared of you,
did you know that?

41
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,756
Scared? Why?
- You slap them.

42
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,215
As a joke.

43
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:40,375
But you should see your face
when you pinch someone.

44
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:43,967
OK, I won't pinch or slap again.

45
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,542
Young Albert, want a cigarette?
- No.

46
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,879
You're Hasje van der Serckt, aren't you?

47
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,461
Off to where?
- Amsterdam.

48
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,835
Amsterdam no less.

49
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:26,502
Did you get fed up,
house painting with Verstegen?

50
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,593
Yes.

51
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:31,968
So you're going to be an artist?

52
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:35,710
Get in, we'll give you a lilt
in the right direction.

53
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,924
What's got into the lad?

54
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,547
Oh, we've seen much worse than this.

55
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,255
I've come to see how Hasje is doing.

56
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,918
Is he gone?
- Yes.

57
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:38,759
He'd be a good match.
You can see him as often as you like.

58
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,629
Only in the house of course.

59
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,175
Not much progress, is there?

60
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,257
Is this where you are?
- Well spotted.

61
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,085
Wasn't Henneman here?
- He's gone, it's off.

62
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,047
Is it off?

63
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,009
It's off.
- What?

64
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,840
It's off. I have no more to say about it.

65
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,928
At last there's a good man,
a superintendent to be...

66
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,708
Tiny, you never learn for God's sake.

67
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,797
Hello... It's off.
- Off?

68
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,958
Broke it off with Henneman.
- Be free to meddle.

69
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,217
I can't go home, I'm helping Aunt.

70
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,053
Don't let this one go
or I'll never get you another one.

71
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,675
And don't you hit or pinch him either.

72
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,376
He's worth his weight in gold.

73
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,717
I hope he's as fat as a pig.

74
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:11,094
Still got a headache, young Albert?

75
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,547
Come and I'll take you out.

76
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,751
No wonder you've got a headache:
all those letters! They would blind me.

77
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,843
I want to marry him.

78
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,800
So you're a hotel porter.

79
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,752
That means you're dependent
on a tip here and there.

80
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,426
On top of my regular wages.
I know they don't amount to much...

81
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,136
but the tips do add up.

82
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,758
It's not a secure job.
- Very insecure.

83
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,755
There's always a chance of promotion.

84
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,092
I want to end up being the manager.

85
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,176
Then you won't be in a draught.

86
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,504
Tiny, how serious is it between you?

87
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,919
We are intending to get engaged.

88
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,595
Isn't that a bit hasty?

89
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,880
An engagement is fine,
but she can't marry until she's twenty.

90
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,754
She's eighteen.

91
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:39,878
We've always agreed that she wouldn't
leave home until she's twenty.

92
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,507
Tell him the reason why.

93
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,593
We never will.

94
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:48,003
Then I'll tell him.
- You'll do nothing of the kind.

95
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:54,053
If there's something I should know...
It is an engagement after all.

96
00:10:54,292 --> 00:11:00,383
I'll tell you what: you get engaged
whenever you like, I pay for the party...

97
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,966
and we keep quiet
about everything else.

98
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,845
Including why she can't marry
until she's twenty.

99
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:09,218
Or this other thing that Tiny mentioned.

100
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,627
So there we were. What a story, eh?

101
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,251
I'm getting all hot and bothered.

102
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:28,883
Hey, when I'm engaged
you can't come into my bed any more.

103
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,881
He doesn't want me to have other men in
my bed. You must see that, young Albert.

104
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,671
Tiny, get the coffee going.

105
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:18,377
Our Tiny is getting engaged.
I pay for the party and you're all invited.

106
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,759
Who to?
- Peter Walraven.

107
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,882
Pete the Porter.

108
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,336
He's always got cystitis
from being in the draught.

109
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,918
Whining on and on and on.
Just like that violinist.

110
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:50,800
He gets rat poison in his coffee.
No one will notice.

111
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,635
Only when he drops down dead.
But they won't know it's the coffee.

112
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,884
Have you got rat poison?

113
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,002
Won't he taste it?
- Not if I stir it well.

114
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,633
Otherwise it might taste funny.

115
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:25,885
But just don't say that as a visitor.
You say: "That's a real nice cuppa."

116
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,845
And then he's under the table: dead.

117
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,926
I say, Tiny, are you getting engaged?

118
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,461
Nothing in my coffee. I drink it black.

119
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,170
As black as my dirty nails.

120
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,838
Nico is a funny guy.

121
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:06,838
He once threw a meatball straight into
the mouth of a man who was yawning.

122
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:10,301
He did.
- Yes, that's me all over.

123
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,008
He nearly choked to death on it.

124
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:15,844
For Christ's sake.

125
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,794
Tiny, what were you doing?

126
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,670
You want one of my shirts?
- They would never fit me.

127
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,875
That man Van Dartel hasn't left yet.

128
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:43,669
I should have let him drink the rat poison.

129
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,885
He'd have gone in the hearse by now.

130
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,502
Don't. Go away.

131
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,302
You stink.

132
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,302
I can't smell anything.

133
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,053
I stink.
- I don't think so.

134
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,129
It's that monthly nasty business.

135
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,260
I don't know if I have real periods now.

136
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,676
Or ever will have again.

137
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:24,968
I used to. I started when I was twelve
and it stopped at fourteen.

138
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:30,417
That is to say there are a few drops,
but very irregularly.

139
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:37,627
I don't know if it's real periods
or unhealthy blood loss.

140
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,177
Do you ever go to a doctor?

141
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,171
I daren't. Isn't that stupid?

142
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,469
I'm scared
that they'll discover something.

143
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,250
What does Grandma say?

144
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,417
Do you think I can talk about it
to that woman?

145
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,920
I might as well talk to the door.

146
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,876
At least it talks sense,
when it creaks in the draught.

147
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,545
What did he want?
- Who?

148
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,339
Henneman, of course.

149
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,261
What did he say?

150
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,174
It was about you.
That you broke it off with him.

151
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,418
I shoved him aside, for you.

152
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,844
It's the way how that matters.

153
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:12,717
Simple. I put a stop to it.
I make no bones about it.

154
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,709
He came to warn me.
- Warn me?

155
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:22,133
He wanted to marry you
and have children.

156
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,345
And you told him that you are...
infertile.

157
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,796
That's what he warned me about.

158
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,003
That's how much I care for you.

159
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:38,803
My parents wanted me to marry him
and he knew that.

160
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,003
But then I met you.

161
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,710
It was the only way to get rid of him.

162
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,167
The boss thinks you ought to leave.

163
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,006
I lied to Henneman.

164
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:32,503
So you're not infertile?
- No, silly boy. I was lying.

165
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,964
To get rid of him
because I want to marry you.

166
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,549
And have babies.

167
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:46,626
Can you imagine what a shock it was?
I wanted to break it off.

168
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:51,592
I'll show you that it was a lie.
Next week is a good time of the month.

169
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,549
Come along.

170
00:18:57,292 --> 00:19:02,092
Your grandma is so ill
she can't do any housework.

171
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,252
I'm pregnant again.

172
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,800
For God's sake, couldn't you have sent
the child out of the room?

173
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,840
Albert, go and play upstairs.
I'll call you when we eat.

174
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:38,298
Dear Lord, the misfortunes
cast upon this house...

175
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,084
And now?

176
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,385
Now it's no longer a case
of whether I want to marry Peter.

177
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,502
I will have to marry Peter.

178
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:51,674
But how?
- Just quickly, before it shows.

179
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:58,003
How could you let that happen? We've
always kept such a close eye on you.

180
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:03,127
You know damn well how it happens.
Don't pretend you're innocence itself.

181
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,260
Don't make me say
it was a dirty toilet seat.

182
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,921
Peter is the father and we've been,
well... careless.

183
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,675
Does he know?
- He'll be here tomorrow to talk about it.

184
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,884
I'm so ashamed.
- Be ashamed about something else.

185
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,631
We've always set a good example.

186
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:27,427
Another option is to get rid of it.
- That I should live to see the day!

187
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,178
I'm fetching Albert. He doesn't know
what's going on and he hasn't eaten yet.

188
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,799
How's the courtship going?

189
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,301
I don't approve of what you've done.
- Done what?

190
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,094
Making up a story to create a break
between Tiny and me.

191
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,088
What you mean "making up"?

192
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:05,921
It's a dirty trick, especially
for a policeman, to dream up a story.

193
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,171
The truth, and nothing but the truth.

194
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,302
She's not infertile.
She's pregnant.

195
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,760
Here, this belongs to Tiny.

196
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,918
There is no letter. What's more,
I've never been examined.

197
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,799
I'm as fertile as anything.
I get pregnant from sitting in wet grass.

198
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,926
Henneman asked me to give you this.

199
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,794
Infertile as a result of inflammations...
- Enough.

200
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:56,424
What it boils down to is
that you told Henneman the truth...

201
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,590
to get rid of him and that
you lied to me to marry me.

202
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,511
Or not?

203
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,466
All right, because I'm no longer
asking for your hand in marriage...

204
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:14,052
there's no point in waiting for your
parents. Give them my regards.

205
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,583
What's the last word?

206
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,583
Erm... hourglass.
- Let me have a look.

207
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:30,877
Yes, hourglass. Well done.
Bye, old chap.

208
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,426
Something the matter?

209
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,840
Hey, are you ill?

210
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,303
That's normal when you're pregnant.

211
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,594
Now what's up?

212
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,545
I've had a miscarriage.

213
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,251
You make your bed, you lie in it.

214
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:44,970
It's a sin. They say that God punishes
but here He's offered a solution.

215
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,509
She could have married well.

216
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:53,010
That superintendent has a good future.

217
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,917
Let's go to bed.

218
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:32,334
Wait...

219
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,928
Your last wages.

220
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:42,256
You're going to do the housekeeping.
Mother is too ill.

221
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,670
That means I can never go out.
- Exactly.

222
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,385
At last, there you are.

223
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,050
I thought you were ill.

224
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,340
Go and make some tea.

225
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,002
Be nice to Grandma.

226
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,628
Here's your guest again.

227
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:51,088
Good to see you, young Albert.
Wait for me, we're going into town.

228
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,792
Looking for something?
- The woman who lives above the place.

229
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,010
She left. Years ago.

230
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:36,918
She runs a dog kennel
in the industrial estate.

231
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,093
I'm in trouble, young Albert,
because of a dirty woman.

232
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:58,717
She'll have to suffer for it,
never mind the consequences.

233
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,963
Is that why you put that knife
in your bag?

234
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:07,129
What are you going to do?
- Scare her or stab her. I'll have to see.

235
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:17,968
If something nasty happens,
get out and wait for me at the bus stop.

236
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,593
What do you want?

237
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,595
I might leave my dog Bobby here
for the holidays.

238
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,052
I'll lock up the Bouvier first.

239
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:50,719
You don't have a dog.
- She doesn't know that.

240
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,093
Don't I know you?

241
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,963
I wouldn't know why.

242
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,130
I don't know if my Bobby
would like it here.

243
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,214
It stinks and it's airless.

244
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:21,884
They get high quality dog food
three times a day...

245
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,010
and clean water all the time.

246
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,507
And they get taken out every day.

247
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,628
I keep thinking I know you
from somewhere.

248
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:42,046
We did meet once, when you lived
over the fish market.

249
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,882
There was also such a stench then.

250
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,880
I've never lived over a fish market.
I don't know you.

251
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,300
I thought I did, but I was wrong.

252
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,968
Not true. I came to see you upstairs.
There was a stench of rotting eel.

253
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:02,173
You're mistaken.
I have never seen you before.

254
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,876
And my kennel is full up.

255
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,301
That woman did some really evil things,
young Albert.

256
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,426
Things your mother knows about.

257
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,754
What evil things?
- I should've killed her.

258
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,923
But that would be something worse...

259
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,918
than what she did.
I didn't want to give her that joy.

260
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,083
Did you notice her fingers?

261
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:47,053
Those dirty nails. Dirt underneath.

262
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,255
You wouldn't trust her with your dog.

263
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:53,965
The maid has just made
a pot of tea.

264
00:30:55,292 --> 00:31:00,506
Could the butler take it upstairs
so that the maid can peel the spuds?

265
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,126
You look pale.
Are you feeling sick?

266
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,628
I don't feel well.
- The doctor is upstairs.

267
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:11,135
Ask him for some pills.
That quack makes a mint out of her.

268
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:15,007
He's here all the time.
He can spare a few pills.

269
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,126
Doctor, I'm not dying am I?

270
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:27,379
You've improved. Drink a lot and
you'll feel better in a few weeks' time.

271
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,842
I'll feel better, he says.

272
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:42,877
It can't be worse than this.
I keep having to be sick and...

273
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:48,594
Doesn't he give you something?
- The doctor is no use.

274
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:53,426
They might as well send a plumber.
It's coming out at both ends.

275
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:57,583
Pour me some tea.
I've got this bad taste in my mouth.

276
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:02,461
Have a cup yourself. Drinking a lot is
good for everyone, the doctor says.

277
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,634
So let's drink.

278
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,925
Aren't you feeling well?

279
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,669
The tea will do you good.

280
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,716
You look so pale, young Albert.

281
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,045
I had some of Grandma's tea.

282
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,794
Does tea often make you feel sick?

283
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,133
No, only today.

284
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,379
I'll make you a hot aniseed drink.
That will help.

285
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,384
There I go again.

286
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:30,584
She's upstairs in bed like a queen
and I'm just a skivvy.

287
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:35,796
That's my lot.
But it's not a lottery lot, I can tell you.

288
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,800
Your lot... ever thought about it?

289
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:43,960
Young Albert Egberts, top of the class,
the brainy one.

290
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:50,302
You can rebel against your lot.
A French Revolution on your own.

291
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,969
Don't be surprised
if there's a revolution here.

292
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:01,052
Young Albert, it's meant to be a surprise.

293
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:06,169
Grandma told me to give it for Easter
and your birthday, but I'll give it now.

294
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,255
You look pale. Are you ill?
Must be the milk.

295
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,421
Were you dreaming?

296
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,709
<i>Of me?</i>

297
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,218
Why is Grandma so ill?

298
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,926
Gall stones.

299
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,001
And a lot of silly pretending.

300
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,716
Shall I cheer you up a little?

301
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,426
If I get some of your chocolate egg...

302
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:52,125
I'll tell you about Uncle Hasje
and the Papuans.

303
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,418
OK.

304
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:18,210
You know that Papuans are warriors.

305
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:21,635
They don't have guns
but they shoot arrows at the Dutch.

306
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:27,339
Poisoned arrows. With real poison.
One arrow and you're a goner.

307
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:41,043
But what you don't know is
that they hardly wear any clothes.

308
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,047
Instead, the men wear penis sheaths.
Do you know what that is?

309
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,542
First some chocolate or I'll stop.

310
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:58,338
The reason is that they always have
a hard... an erection.

311
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:03,634
That's when the penis isn't like
when you pee, but it's up here.

312
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,797
Straight up.

313
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,425
And they shove this sheath over it.
That's just their custom.

314
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,631
They tie the sheath with a string
round the neck...

315
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:17,218
and under the balls.
To keep it in place.

316
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:22,503
They don't teach you that at school.
You need your Aunt Tiny for it.

317
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:28,292
Do you want to hear more?
- Yes.

318
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:49,961
Koos Kassenaar wants to get married.
- Who?

319
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,258
You don't know him. He's from Breda.

320
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,758
Should I do it?

321
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,710
I'd be stuck in Breda.

322
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,963
I'll miss you.

323
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,177
You dirty-minded sod.

324
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,010
He's coming. In a fantastic suit.

325
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,218
He had to erm...

326
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:22,173
Could you knot my tie for me?
Nice and tight.

327
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,842
Oh, your nose
shines like a billiard ball.

328
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:31,052
You can't go to the altar like that.

329
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,509
I don't want any powder on my face.
- No?

330
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:41,919
You're shiny all over.
Come here a minute.

331
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:47,553
Ouch, I've got a very sensitive skin.
- But you've got a shiny face.

332
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,293
All right, but you're taking my skin off.

333
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,002
Koos...

334
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,376
What have you got on your face?

335
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:10,046
Is that what they do in Breda? Before
their wedding day they sit in the sun?

336
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,131
You with your freckles, too.

337
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,877
I can't be on a photo with you like this.

338
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,669
Martina Antonia Maria van der Serckt...

339
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:24,833
will you take Kornelis Lucas Maria
Kassenaar to be your wedded husband.

340
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:31,548
And will you be true to him for better or
for worse, in sickness and in health?

341
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,136
Yes.

342
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:23,299
Hello dear people, hello to you all.

343
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,463
Hello Koos, nice party.

344
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:43,377
You'll need it mainly for pissing.

345
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:46,674
What. What do you mean?

346
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,584
You don't seem to know much
about Tiny.

347
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,584
Getting some fresh air.

348
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:03,421
What did the apostles do after
the miracle of the loaves and the fishes?

349
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,214
Come with me.

350
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:13,632
After the miracle of the loaves...

351
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:18,135
they were stuck with the leftovers.

352
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,211
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

353
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,171
There was nothing to tell.
It's not true.

354
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:30,673
You could have said there was a rumour.
I look an idiot at my own wedding.

355
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,553
I didn't know of any rumours.
- I've been misled.

356
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,129
I was supposed to be infertile. Fell
wide-legged out of a tree on a branch.

357
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:44,176
I'd never have children, the doctors said
and now I am expecting my third.

358
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:48,258
Koos, don't believe gossip.

359
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,919
Anyone can see you're a fertile couple.

360
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,630
The honeymoon is off.

361
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:58,834
Tomorrow we'll go to the doctor
to be referred to a specialist.

362
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,428
I want certainty.

363
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,628
And our honeymoon in Lugano?

364
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:07,585
I'll claim the money from the insurance.
No honeymoon until I'm sure.

365
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,838
I'd so been looking forward to Lugano.

366
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:14,669
Get into a normal dress
because we're leaving in half an hour.

367
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:20,426
Young Albert...

368
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:25,508
Go and ask one of those
waiters for a sharp wire cutter.

369
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:57,126
Young Albert, how are you feeling?

370
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,927
I can see you're ill.
You're white as a sheet.

371
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:08,676
I want to go to Breda.
- You can't go to Breda like that.

372
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:10,843
Aunt Tiny needs me.

373
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:14,834
She has no children.
I have to be her son in the holidays.

374
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,377
Off they go.
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

375
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:31,630
Go and lie down and you'll feel better.
- OK.

376
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,885
Poor boy.

377
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,460
Are you all hot?

378
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:11,709
Move up.

379
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:18,925
Do you know it can grow?

380
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:23,053
And something comes out
that's not pee?

381
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:28,510
Before long, seed will come out
to make kiddies.

382
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,425
And nothing at all comes out...

383
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,302
Your Uncle Koos...

384
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,843
Well, something comes out of it...

385
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,127
but it's lazy seed.

386
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:42,178
Remember him shouting at me
on our wedding day?

387
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:46,713
We went to the hospital for
an examination, and what do you think?

388
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,595
Your Uncle Koos is as sterile as hell.

389
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:56,886
So Peter Porter was wrong
about that letter?

390
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:00,715
What letter?
- From the hospital.

391
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:03,092
He showed it to you. I was there.

392
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:09,126
He got it from the policeman.
It said you couldn't have children.

393
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,714
Oh, that nonsense.

394
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,881
Now I remember.
The porter stood there bragging.

395
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,296
Men... Yuck...

396
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:24,877
I'll get you a sandwich.
You're better now.

397
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:34,583
Albert, one thing: Never mention
that letter when Koos is there.

398
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:39,010
It was forged.

399
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:43,797
I can't show you it was forged
because I tore it up.

400
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:48,379
It could lead to great misunderstandings.
You don't want to be part of that.

401
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,755
Don't forget.

402
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:04,299
<i>Maaike Boezaardt here. Hello?
- Hello, neighbour.</i>

403
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:13,631
What do you mean... blood.
Can't you be any clearer?

404
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,843
Get me Aunt Tiny or Uncle Koos.

405
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:19,213
<i>They're not here.
- They can't have left you alone?</i>

406
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:22,469
They <i>don't appear.</i>
- Have you looked everywhere?

407
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,053
<i>They're in the bedroom.</i>

408
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:27,469
The bed's full of blood.
- What's going on?

409
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:48,342
Yes, young Albert.
Your aunt is still losing blood.

410
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:52,460
Shouldn't you go to the doctor?

411
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:58,759
I will, one day.

412
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:11,005
I don't mind the creatures
but I do mind their mess.

413
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:14,420
Hurry up and get in. We'll be late.

414
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,089
Stop moaning...

415
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:27,459
or I'll throw you out and you can sit
beside the road with your pillow.

416
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:34,881
Tiny, sit straight. If you go smack into
the windscreen we're even more in trouble.

417
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:39,339
I'm enough in trouble with a man
who looks for offspring elsewhere.

418
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:43,591
Why are you so quiet, young Albert?

419
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,551
You don't mind it being a bit later?
Good thing you rang them.

420
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:52,086
I want to go and see my parents.
They mustn't think...

421
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:54,010
Stop nagging-

422
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:58,084
I'll tell him what's what.
- There's a boy in the car.

423
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:00,176
I'll throw it in their faces.

424
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:03,585
That mother of yours for a start.

425
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:08,960
See you next time.

426
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,378
How's things?
- Great, let's say.

427
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:16,542
Nearly bled to death for a change.
But otherwise moonlight and roses.

428
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,876
And you, Hanny?

429
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:22,670
We're going to cheer them up
in Lynx Street.

430
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,211
Thanks for having me to stay.

431
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,050
Had a good time?
- Yes.

432
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:04,136
Do you feel like going? Or not?

433
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:36,052
Keep your mouth shut.
The party hasn't started yet.

434
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,459
Party!

435
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:42,544
I'm wearing my slave's outfit. I'll have
to crawl through the dust for them.

436
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,760
Party. Yes. But not for me.

437
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:49,751
They get me all the way from Breda
to work for them.

438
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:56,216
They all knew I was kept as a slave
but nobody took action.

439
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,675
Congratulations.

440
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:20,094
Congratulations everybody.

441
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:21,548
Mother, you too.

442
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,969
Tiny, stop that and come here.

443
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,044
Or go to the kitchen.
- Don't cry.

444
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,502
You know her. She'll be OK.

445
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:44,051
No expense spared.

446
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:48,009
Are you going to order me around
like you used to?

447
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,797
Nice dress!

448
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,843
Everybody one teaspoonful
and there'll be enough for you all.

449
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,052
Hey, young Albert Egberts...

450
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,588
top of the class. Tell me:
A ruby wedding, what does that mean?

451
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,385
A fortieth wedding anniversary.

452
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:14,633
That's true. And how old
is your mother now?

453
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,583
Forty-two.
- Forty-two.

454
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:24,047
Yes, typical for
those hypocritical Catholics.

455
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:28,007
First it's their daughter's
42nd birthday...

456
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,468
and a week later it's their 40th
wedding anniversary.

457
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,718
Forty-two minus forty is two.

458
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:41,172
Hanny was two
when they got married at last.

459
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:46,625
We kept being harangued about morals
but you didn't bother to get married.

460
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,464
Hush, Tiny. Quiet.

461
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,634
A look at them sitting there.

462
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:55,461
The Royal couple.
Making a servant of their own daughter.

463
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:58,635
That's enough, Tiny.
We couldn't get married.

464
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:01,630
What?
- Don't be provoked.

465
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:05,922
I was in prison, in Veenhuizen.
- I say!

466
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:09,959
There was no work in the 30s.
I went grape picking in France.

467
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:14,220
Then I heard I was going to be a father.
I went straight home.

468
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:18,423
After the border there was a man who
pulled out a knife.

469
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:22,252
I stabbed him in the guts
with the grape scissors.

470
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:28,508
I spent eighteen months behind bars.
When I got out we married immediately.

471
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,968
<i>Gut Ham was two the“.</i>

472
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:35,384
We moved house straight away
and that's how it happened.

473
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:39,092
So that your new neighbours
wouldn't know.

474
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:40,757
Do I hear that only now?

475
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:46,386
Now I understand why you're not really
part of the family.

476
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,546
Because for two years
you were illegitimate.

477
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,590
The eldest daughter was made
assistant mother...

478
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:58,876
"because my real mother was too ill
or so they said.

479
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:03,131
And you never stopped meddling with me
and being a tyrant.

480
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,049
I don't know what
you're talking about, Tiny.

481
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,928
I only did what I was told to do.

482
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:11,798
When I got married
I gave you good advice.

483
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,050
Good advice. Bad actions.

484
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:17,303
Haven't I always been a good mother?

485
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,709
You've been no mother at all to me.

486
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,091
Your two youngest children
were brought up by your eldest daughter.

487
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,380
To punish her for being unwanted.

488
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:33,709
And when she was married, you said I
couldn't leave home before I was twenty.

489
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:39,261
Supposedly because I was not a good
girl and couldn't be trusted out of doors.

490
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:43,796
But in fact it was
because you needed me as a skivvy.

491
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:45,049
That's enough.

492
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:50,002
You have kept me on a short lease
on the pretext of that very bad thing.

493
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:55,044
But that very bad thing
is never mentioned by name.

494
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:59,834
But if I claim that this crime...

495
00:56:00,042 --> 00:56:01,464
and it was a crime...

496
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:05,257
and the consequences
were Hanny's responsibility?

497
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:08,919
I only wanted to help you, you bitch.

498
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:13,344
Some ignore a helping hand,
some press it against a white hot stove.

499
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:17,418
And sometimes a helping hand
ruins something for good.

500
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,344
You think about that one!

501
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:33,667
Well... erm... The cake is getting warm.

502
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,424
Hi there.

503
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,136
Koos...

504
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:50,094
Young Albert, leave your bike here
and come with us.

505
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:53,752
I don't want to take the bus to school
tomorrow.

506
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,505
Tiny, are you coming with us or what?

507
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:02,669
I don't want that woman in the taxi.
And never in my house again.

508
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:07,135
She is not welcome here either.
I don't see her as my daughter.

509
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:12,133
OK, then I'll go into a hotel.
Koos has the purse but never mind:

510
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,383
I'll play the whore in Eindhoven.

511
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,633
Don't act silly.
- Look who's talking.

512
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:22,042
Don't act silly?
Only you are allowed to do that.

513
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:27,840
Because you are so sensible.
And so straight-laced.

514
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:31,050
Calm, calm down.

515
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,716
Come to the taxi before worse happens.

516
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:37,170
Albert, get on your bike.
I want to hear you come home.

517
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:40,220
How I would love to hear a child
come home.

518
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,674
But that's impossible,
thanks to what you call silly things.

519
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:51,125
Have a proper examination.
- I did. Guess what the result was.

520
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:54,130
I want to get going.
Get on your bike, Albert.

521
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,967
Dad, it was a great party.
Tomorrow all will be forgotten.

522
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:05,884
I'll be the ruin of all of you.
And you first of all, you holier than thou.

523
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,094
Leave me alone.

524
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:45,467
The last bus is gone.

525
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,296
The next one isn't till tomorrow.

526
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,257
I'm not waiting for the bus.
I'm waiting for a customer.

527
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,507
Go away, otherwise they'll think
I've got somebody already.

528
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,759
Albert, bugger off.

529
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:11,172
I don't have enough for a hotel room.

530
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,255
Pity.

531
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,046
I only want clients who pay for a hotel.

532
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:19,840
But it'll buy a ticket to Breda.

533
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,753
I'll walk along with you to the station.

534
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,504
Are you cold?

535
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:04,754
None of them can stand the sight of me.
Except you.

536
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:09,751
More's the pity.
I want to be rid of them all.

537
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,127
I can do without them.

538
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:24,043
Remember that kennel
with that old woman?

539
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,918
What I need to square with Hanny
has something to do with it.

540
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,131
I won't see you at Grandma's then?

541
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,593
No? Just you wait.

542
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:44,253
I'm going to be there every week
from now on.

543
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:48,002
I'll ram in into them
until they understand.

544
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:51,918
No skin so thick
but I will tear it in the end.

545
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,177
Good evening.

546
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:10,003
Are you Mr Egberts, Albert,
born on 30 April 1950?

547
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,845
Yes... yes.

548
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:16,753
I say, does superintendent Henneman
still work with you?

549
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:20,218
Karel Henneman?
- Yes, I was engaged to him once.

550
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:22,467
He's now our Chief of Police.

551
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:25,250
Just what my parents hoped for.

552
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:27,177
Married? Children?

553
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:30,421
We're not here to...
- But you can tell me how he is.

554
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:36,089
He has a family.
Two boys and two girls.

555
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:39,800
Say hello to him from
Tiny van der Serckt.

556
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,295
And then add: Married. No children.

557
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,796
Mr Egberts...

558
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:50,178
on your bicycle you left the address
Lynx Street number 12.

559
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,136
Your parents waited for two hour
before ringing us.

560
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,751
The trouble I predicted.

561
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:58,210
Beg your pardon?
- No, nothing.

562
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:05,218
I was saying I abducted my nephew
to use him as a sex slave, for me alone.

563
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:10,084
It's a punishable of fence to abduct
a minor from his parents.

564
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:12,295
But I'm his aunt.

565
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,338
They're terribly worried.

566
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:16,924
Are they? That's their problem.

567
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,968
Will you phone the station?

568
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,963
You can come with us.

569
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:39,261
I said I was abducting him...

570
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:42,718
to use him as a sex slave,
for me alone.

571
01:02:56,167 --> 01:03:00,753
What made you consort with a woman
who put the family to shame?

572
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:05,545
She stood at a bus stop in the night.
There was n bus due for hours.

573
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:10,301
I would have let her freeze to death.
Let her be stabbed to death.

574
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,756
And look at you...

575
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,507
<i>Hello, who's that on the phone?</i>

576
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:58,294
Albert Egberts. Hanny's son.
Your nephew. A friend.

577
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,753
<i>So Pm Tiny Kassenaar.
What do you want?</i>

578
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:03,506
I happened to be in Breda
so I thought...

579
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:08,171
<i>Sorry. Koos is on a job out of town.
Won't be home before midnight.</i>

580
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:14,052
Pity. Great pity. But if you don't mind
I'll pop in for a coffee.

581
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,715
That's ten years ago, isn't it?

582
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:43,595
I hardly recognize you with long hair.

583
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:46,794
Come on in.

584
01:04:53,542 --> 01:04:56,469
How are things at the Kassenaars?

585
01:04:56,667 --> 01:05:01,965
Same boring old way. That bloody
redhead is hardly ever at home.

586
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:05,047
Often away in the weekends, too.

587
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,253
Do you get out yourself?

588
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:11,216
For years I was holed up
in my parents' house.

589
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:15,381
Like a lynx in a cage
I got used to it.

590
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:19,178
So now I still stay in my cage.

591
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,376
I daren't leave my pen.

592
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:32,053
Don't spill any.

593
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:41,713
This morning I was thinking of when
Hasje played soldiers in New Guinea.

594
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:43,718
I was eleven.

595
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:45,967
A bit later you married Koos.

596
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:50,671
We were in bed together
and you told stories about Papuans.

597
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,676
Eleven? In my bed?

598
01:05:54,292 --> 01:05:58,843
When you were four or five maybe.
But not a big boy of eleven.

599
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,677
And maybe go to prison?

600
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,885
Grandma had given me an Easter egg...

601
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:07,343
and you demanded piece after piece.

602
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:11,094
I loved it.

603
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,053
And yes...

604
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,130
sometimes it became a bit obscene.

605
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:20,292
You liar. Such a thing never happened.

606
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:25,720
This morning, under the shower...

607
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:29,093
I got this enormous...

608
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:35,130
nostalgia for our
story-telling sessions.

609
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:39,294
Nearly made me feel sick.

610
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:44,085
It happened that badly once before.

611
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:49,044
When I'd taken you to the station
and you told the police...

612
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,588
you were abducting me.
- To needle them, yes.

613
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:58,177
I wasn't serious. Their police dog
was more serious than me.

614
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:05,801
No, but... in the following days
and weeks it kept haunting me.

615
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,252
But you didn't come to Breda.

616
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:11,001
I was seventeen. I didn't dare.

617
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:14,546
Well... and now you suddenly do?

618
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,176
What's this then?

619
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:29,960
As an advance on the story-telling.

620
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:42,885
Don't you have a larger one?

621
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,968
That's too much laundry for me.

622
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:49,839
Hey... not so impatient.

623
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:52,669
First a piece of that egg.

624
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,715
Force of habit?

625
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:32,836
What is? What's the force of habit?

626
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,756
You keeping on your apron.

627
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,636
Young Albert...

628
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:52,633
You must untie the bow.

629
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,001
Again.

630
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,422
Once more.

631
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,260
Tiny, what is this about?

632
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:16,213
You don't understand much do you?

633
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,177
You haven't lost your figure.
- Surprised?

634
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,677
For a woman my age with no kids.

635
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:35,793
Nah...

636
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,594
I wouldn't mind some chocolate.

637
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,594
A foretaste...

638
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:05,386
Albert... you're only trying
to make me look ridiculous.

639
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:10,299
You've always promised to tell me
how you got it.

640
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,756
I fell off my bike.

641
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:17,011
Teeth through my lip.
Handle bars through my teeth.

642
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:21,048
All I remember is the bell
with a four-leaved clover on it.

643
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:22,797
Last thing I saw.

644
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,677
You smashed your teeth on
the handle bars and lost so much blood...

645
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:33,509
that you lost consciousness.
- The blood was not from my mouth.

646
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,676
Now I want to stop talking about it.

647
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,802
Does it help if I feed you
some Easter egg?

648
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:54,220
The blood ran down my legs
into my socks and my shoes.

649
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:59,761
It covered the pedals. I'd lost litres
of blood before my teeth broke off.

650
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:06,213
Now I'm shutting up about it.
It sickens me every time.

651
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:08,261
I can imagine.

652
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:10,508
No, you can't imagine...

653
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:14,548
young Albert Egberts
with your tutorials and your knowledge.

654
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:19,710
What makes me sick is not
that I nearly bled to death...

655
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,085
but that I didn't bleed to death
in the end.

656
01:11:24,292 --> 01:11:26,460
Tell me the whole story then.

657
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:32,095
If I told you the whole story,
you'd wish you had never heard it.

658
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:36,004
If only because the role
your mother played.

659
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,626
Now I do want to know.

660
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:52,298
When I got my bike back,
the bell cover was out of joint.

661
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,468
I couldn't ring my bicycle bell.

662
01:11:54,667 --> 01:12:00,379
The top of the bell fell down a drain.
I tried to get it out with a magnet...

663
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:17,625
You don't mind if I touch you?

664
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,050
Go ahead if you must.

665
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:35,252
Tiny, shall I caress you with my tongue?

666
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,629
As I say: go ahead if you must.

667
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:53,092
You'll have to spread your legs
a bit wider.

668
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,380
Oh... young Albert...

669
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:33,299
I'm dying for a smoke.
- Can't help you there. I don't smoke.

670
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,752
Have a bit of Easter egg.

671
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:40,298
Is this what students do
in their spare time?

672
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:46,841
You were grunting like a pig. I thought
you were about to bite and eat me up.

673
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:52,384
It sounds as if you've never before
been... approached like this.

674
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,464
Who by?

675
01:13:54,667 --> 01:14:00,048
Koos doesn't know the first thing. He'd
be scared I'd strangle him with my legs.

676
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:04,669
When do I get my share?

677
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:11,336
Never thought of it.
Ok, let's go about it.

678
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:16,090
I'd put a towel down.

679
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:21,542
Damn you and your chocolate.
The whole mattress is ruined.

680
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:28,047
Students mess as much as they like.
They eat in bed...

681
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:33,169
they pee in the wash basin
and pooh on a newspaper.

682
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:37,969
And they are our future leaders?
Bunch of dirty sods.

683
01:14:39,417 --> 01:14:43,091
Just look at it. An expensive mattress
gone to the dogs.

684
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,584
We'd just turned the summer side up.

685
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:47,510
How are you insured?

686
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:50,084
All risk. Via my parents.

687
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:53,340
Explain what happened:
Easter egg got crushed

688
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:57,678
during an erotic congress
of Albert and his Aunt Tiny.

689
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,261
They'll be happy to pay.

690
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:22,338
Grandma?

691
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:28,251
Grandma? Don't be startled.
It's me, Albert.

692
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:34,342
Albert...
- Speak up. I'm hard of hearing.

693
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,048
Albert, your grandson.

694
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:48,007
Young Albert.
Yes, now I recognize you.

695
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,551
What are you doing here?

696
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:55,584
Turn down the radio.

697
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:05,211
I was visiting Aunt Tiny.
She didn't tell me you were here.

698
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,927
Why are you crying?

699
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:15,128
What's this: are you on a leash
like a dog?

700
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,629
Do they feed you?

701
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:55,463
In the summer I'll come and see you
in Lynx Street.

702
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,503
All right, Grandma?

703
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,590
Hey... Koos.

704
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:34,090
Hey, young Albert.

705
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:41,925
That's my... secretary.
Such a wonderful typist!

706
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:45,052
What are you doing in Breda?

707
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:48,959
I was in the area.
I had a cup of coffee at your place.

708
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:51,004
Pity I wasn't there.

709
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:56,341
But my mother-in-law was there.
She's been with us for a week.

710
01:17:56,542 --> 01:18:01,009
I'm taking her back to the old man
tomorrow. We've done our duty.

711
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:03,461
I can do without her.

712
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:08,297
I've got to get back to Nijmegen.

713
01:18:10,292 --> 01:18:14,168
Your study loan is probably used up.

714
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,048
At here, that's for the train ticket.

715
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:23,377
Oh and... as to my secretary...

716
01:18:23,792 --> 01:18:26,174
Don't mention her in the family.

717
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,757
You'll understand.
- Yes.

718
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:33,628
Have fun in Nijmegen.

719
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,755
Bye then.
- Bye then.

720
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:00,886
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

721
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:08,425
<i>Our candidate goes on
to the next word. It's the letter T.</i>

722
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,460
Thought. T-H-U-U-G-H-T.

723
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,879
Wow, what a stench.

724
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,095
If I didn't come in
this would be a pigsty.

725
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:28,881
Toilet.

726
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,046
What was that?
- The toilet.

727
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:40,758
Tiny...
- Pipe down.

728
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,385
Christ...

729
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,090
Yes.

730
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:52,761
Hanny is calling for help.

731
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,634
How come you didn't hear?

732
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,257
<i>The neighbour says she hay there
for hours perhaps.</i>

733
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,461
Does she now!

734
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:19,794
<i>Why didn't you hear her?
What's wrong with your ears?</i>

735
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,551
Say Albert, when did you last
visit your mother?

736
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,502
<i>That's a month ago.</i>

737
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:33,214
I go see her three times a week.
What was your question?

738
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:37,885
Bye, Albert.

739
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:21,801
She really can't stay in her own home.

740
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:38,966
Hey Cynthia, how old are you now?

741
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,674
I'm thirteen years old.

742
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,338
That's enough. Why do you keep hitting
my mother with that wet handkerchief?

743
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:50,465
I don't hit her. I wipe her lips.
- You keep hitting her.

744
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:54,257
I have enough reason for it, don't I?
- Tiny, shut up.

745
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:59,296
Go play outside, kids.
Be back in half an hour.

746
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:06,048
They're sent away. Important matters
are too much for their tender souls.

747
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:19,501
All your life you've been lying.
Koos is not sterile, you are.

748
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:25,130
If you'd been honest
we might have pitied you.

749
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:30,761
But you've always blamed others:
Grandma, Grandpa, my mother. Koos.

750
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:33,921
Everybody is guilty in your books.

751
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:39,126
Blaming others for your failed life:
terrorising, lying...

752
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:44,085
quarrelling, that's all you've ever
done. And now you're hitting my mother.

753
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:47,884
That's as far as it goes Mr Playwright.

754
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:52,551
I'll tell you what your mother did,
that hypocritical old bag.

755
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:57,589
No, of course you don't want your son
to know what you did to me.

756
01:23:57,792 --> 01:24:01,668
But he wants to know
so he's going to get it.

757
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:05,964
Mum and Dad had no words for it
but I do.

758
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:13,552
Take the sanitary towels home.
I'll buy new ones myself.

759
01:24:14,792 --> 01:24:18,549
And watch out
or you'll be pregnant before long.

760
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:25,053
And don't come near Black Path. I know
what Nico van Dartel is up to, there.

761
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:28,509
I'm telling you, stay away from there.

762
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:37,009
I've got enough.
I've been having periods for two years.

763
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:03,668
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

764
01:25:04,042 --> 01:25:06,803
Got any cigarettes?
- I'll go get them.

765
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:15,130
Want some lemonade? Come along in.

766
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:17,716
I'm not here for lemonade.

767
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,421
I've come to smoke.

768
01:25:21,167 --> 01:25:23,004
You can do that inside.

769
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,255
Something wrong?

770
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:52,425
Tiny... is something the matter?

771
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,675
It's just not coming.

772
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:59,047
Have you been together?
- Together?

773
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,921
With a boy or a man?

774
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:04,671
Oh, that kind of being together.
Don't be ridiculous.

775
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:11,883
Don't tell the old folks.

776
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,338
Mrs Egberts.

777
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:48,469
Did you say you were fifteen?
- Fourteen, nearly fifteen.

778
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,381
The result is positive.

779
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:55,590
In this case that is bad news.
You know who the father is?

780
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,883
Let me put it this way:

781
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:04,385
The man you have been with, does he
know you've not been menstruating?

782
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:07,345
I think you'd better tell the doctor
everything.

783
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:11,423
He is married and his name is Nico.

784
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:13,924
Nico?
- Children?

785
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:19,251
Two. A girl Tiny's age, and a boy
a bit older.

786
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,594
Dirty sod. He tried it on me,
ten years ago.

787
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,718
And I heard that his own daughter...

788
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:30,800
I strongly advise you not to burden him
with Tiny's pregnancy.

789
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:33,715
There is no point in ruining
a family as well.

790
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:36,803
Better tell your parents everything.

791
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,511
Often the child oi minor in the family
is raised by the girl's parents.

792
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:44,755
Not in our family.

793
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:49,628
They left the upbringing of Tiny
and my younger brother to me.

794
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:53,052
My mother felt too old
and too ill to do it.

795
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:57,801
We are now twelve years on
and she sees herself as ancient.

796
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:00,628
And my father says:

797
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:05,669
I'd rather bury a daughter than take her
to the altar pregnant. No.

798
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:10,755
It's not a good idea to tell our parents
that Tiny is happily expecting.

799
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:15,260
Then I don't know.
- You do. Let her get rid of it.

800
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:18,042
We don't do that at St Joseph's hospital.

801
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:21,047
But you must know of a clinic.

802
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:25,588
If I were allowed to mention one,
you wouldn't be able to afford it.

803
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:29,549
A cheaper address then. Private.
As long as it's done neatly.

804
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:32,298
This is a Roman Catholic hospital.

805
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:36,927
If I were to give you an address
I would be overstepping the lines.

806
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:40,336
And personally I am opposed to abortion.

807
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:46,338
I am convinced that at the moment
of conception the soul descends.

808
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,511
I think your soul never descended.

809
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,299
Ah, the Van der Serckt ladies.

810
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:24,009
No jokes, Nico. We've just come back
from the hospital.

811
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:25,500
Appendix?

812
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:29,174
Our Tiny is expecting.

813
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:34,752
Why tell me about it?

814
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:38,422
Why we're telling you?
You tell me.

815
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:43,088
I'm a good friend of the family. You can
come to me with all your problems.

816
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,300
As long as it doesn't cost.

817
01:29:45,542 --> 01:29:47,296
How long has this been going on?

818
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:52,335
Listen, the woman got infantile paralysis,
what they call polio now...

819
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,835
It's yours, Nico.

820
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,674
What's your sister talking about?
- Don't pretend you don't know.

821
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:07,217
Please explain to Tiny that you can't
blame just any man for your pregnancy.

822
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:10,711
I know you.
You tried the same with me.

823
01:30:11,167 --> 01:30:15,422
With Tiny you managed and now
she's pregnant. How do we solve this?

824
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:18,719
If you pay up we'll leave your wife
and our parents out of it.

825
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:20,836
I'd do anything for you...

826
01:30:21,042 --> 01:30:23,720
but I can't admit to something
I haven't done.

827
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:25,629
And I'd certainly not pay.

828
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:29,009
Nico, you can't say it didn't happen.

829
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:34,257
Come along, we're going to see his wife.
- Have fun.

830
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,423
There's no point,
Leentje knows all about it.

831
01:30:39,792 --> 01:30:43,382
Look, that's where it happened.

832
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,046
Sometimes Nelleke was present.

833
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,053
We could go straight to the police.
- You'd better sleep on that, Hanny.

834
01:30:55,417 --> 01:31:01,295
I will deny everything and you'll go to
prison for making a false accusation.

835
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:07,085
Tiny, I'm really sorry for you.
All the best.

836
01:31:07,917 --> 01:31:10,216
I will tell our mother and father.

837
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:14,007
Give them my regards.
High time we played cards again.

838
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,834
Tiny... Come.

839
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,923
He tried it on me when I was twelve.
- Yes...

840
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:36,840
At home they believed him and not me.

841
01:31:37,042 --> 01:31:39,341
I know that story.

842
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:46,001
I've got an idea. A blood test can show
if somebody is related to you.

843
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:50,719
In the hospital they can take blood
from the foetus and compare it to Nico's.

844
01:31:50,917 --> 01:31:52,967
It's useless, Hanny.
Nico is not the only one.

845
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:59,926
No, Tiny... and you're asking me
to help you?

846
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:14,169
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.

847
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:17,964
I am erm...

848
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,132
I have...

849
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:28,886
There's somebody...
a friend of my parents, Nico van Dartel...

850
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:34,049
"who has done really bad things.
Really very bad.

851
01:32:36,792 --> 01:32:40,928
What Nico van Dartel has done
he has to confess himself.

852
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:43,377
I'm here to listen to your sins.

853
01:33:04,917 --> 01:33:08,295
Hurry up, woman. We're going.

854
01:33:15,667 --> 01:33:18,345
Heady? Hurry up.
- All right.

855
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:24,463
Did you come to see us?
We're going off to play cards.

856
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:27,049
Tiny is in, so you can see her.

857
01:33:38,417 --> 01:33:43,501
Tiny... I found a woman who has
a practice at home.

858
01:33:44,792 --> 01:33:46,001
Not expensive.

859
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:49,674
I'll pay three quarters. Is that OK?

860
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,508
Is it far to go?
- Over the fish market.

861
01:33:57,292 --> 01:33:58,382
I daren't.

862
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:07,094
You don't have to go on your own.
I will come with you. We'll do it together.

863
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:09,752
<i>Come.</i>

864
01:34:22,792 --> 01:34:24,546
I don't dare.

865
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:28,543
Come along.
Don't give up now. Come.

866
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,125
<i>Come.</i>

867
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:18,045
Hail Mary, full of grace...

868
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:56,134
Have you been done?

869
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:02,465
The sanitary towel cost some extra.

870
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:06,003
How do you feel?

871
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,261
In pain?

872
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:14,595
She didn't even use any instruments.
She did it with her sharp nails.

873
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:16,672
That can't be true?

874
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,960
You didn't come in with me, did you!

875
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:40,798
Go upstairs before they ask
why you look so white.

876
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:48,260
And put an old curtain underneath you.
Something you can throw away later.

877
01:36:48,458 --> 01:36:52,630
If the pain doesn't stop,
send Hasje over to me.

878
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:19,918
If you don't come down
I'll put your food away again.

879
01:38:21,583 --> 01:38:24,961
Whole days in bed never cured anyone.

880
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,260
Where are you going?

881
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:04,678
Pretending to be ill and now going
out to party in town.

882
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:40,720
Now what's up?

883
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,042
Oh girl...

884
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:03,419
Oh... Nico, hurry up, man.

885
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:05,838
I've phoned him.

886
01:40:08,167 --> 01:40:09,127
You'll be all right.

887
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:37,593
The doctor told us.
You've been to her over the fish market.

888
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:40,885
Good thing Nico found you
and has a telephone.

889
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:45,927
Van Dartel found her. Had you heard?
- No.

890
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:54,259
He rang for an ambulance.
He saved your life. Do you realize that?

891
01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:09,423
Why didn't you come to me?
Why go to Nico van Dartel for help?

892
01:41:10,958 --> 01:41:14,881
I hoped he would open the door
and I would collapse at his feet.

893
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:18,965
Dead.

894
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:24,719
Then everybody would find out
that he had done it.

895
01:41:24,917 --> 01:41:28,046
I wanted to die and lie dead at his feet.

896
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:34,634
I love him.

897
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:53,708
This is for your parents:
your medical report.

898
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,380
Jesus.
- Can't be true.

899
01:42:12,583 --> 01:42:15,594
What was trumps?
- Clubs. You start.

900
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:26,419
That's mine.
- No, it's mine. I've got the ace.

901
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:31,593
Hello, girlie.

902
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:34,757
Did they let you go home?

903
01:42:36,042 --> 01:42:38,175
Come, come, Nico.

904
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,423
Your turn.

905
01:42:41,417 --> 01:42:42,969
AVE. aye.

906
01:42:43,167 --> 01:42:44,802
And here's a three.
- Look at that.

907
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:48,169
Got another one?

908
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,419
And that was all I got.

909
01:42:55,833 --> 01:42:58,050
Then I was in their power.

910
01:43:00,125 --> 01:43:03,336
Thanks to the wonderful help
I got from your mother.

911
01:43:05,042 --> 01:43:10,043
Because she forked out so little money
I'm now mutilated.

912
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:11,886
It was a crime.

913
01:43:12,917 --> 01:43:15,797
The cheapest address
far and wide around.

914
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:19,010
Well, thanks a lot.

915
01:43:22,708 --> 01:43:27,094
Well, that's quite a revelation.

916
01:43:27,292 --> 01:43:30,053
After nearly forty years of marriage.

917
01:43:36,208 --> 01:43:40,843
Except that this letter
was never seen by my parents.

918
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:58,213
Happy with your copy?

919
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:16,002
Got a cigarette for me?

920
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:21,880
Are you smoking?

921
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,920
In a minute I will be.

922
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:38,839
Long ago you got into bed with me...

923
01:44:40,042 --> 01:44:44,842
and I told you about the Papuans.
We went out on the town together.

924
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:52,335
And now here you are with your letter
and your reproach.

925
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:59,418
I always thought there was one person
in the family who understood me.

926
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,797
I was wrong.

927
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:08,718
I shouldn't have done it.

928
01:45:30,251 --> 01:45:35,217
<i>The story has it that I discovered Tiny
aged four, when she was sixteen...</i>

929
01:45:35,417 --> 01:45:38,297
<i>and I waddled after her
like a duckling.</i>

930
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:43,002
<i>Later I fell in love.</i>

931
01:45:43,833 --> 01:45:47,543
<i>I have desired her, hated her...</i>

932
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:53,053
<i>and finally understood her.</i>

933
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:59,208
<i>After many hitter words I understood
what she was trying to say.</i>

934
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:04,921
<i>Now she's in hospital
and doesn't speak.</i>

935
01:46:06,167 --> 01:46:09,213
<i>There is no medical reason for</i> it...

936
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:13,050
<i>“but Tiny remains sf lent.</i>

937
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:41,045
Young Albert.
- Hey, Koos.

938
01:46:42,125 --> 01:46:46,711
I didn't recognize you in a Mercedes.
Weren't you always an Opel man?

939
01:46:46,918 --> 01:46:51,054
That ancient history.
This is my fourth Mercedes, man.

940
01:46:51,251 --> 01:46:55,589
This is Henk, and that's Willem.
Two of my sons.

941
01:46:55,792 --> 01:47:00,259
And that's young Albert,
world-famous in Amsterdam.

942
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:07,592
She's in oncology. Room number 2-203.

943
01:47:39,792 --> 01:47:42,126
Hello, Aunt Tiny.

944
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:54,594
So... had a nice chat catching up?

945
01:47:59,667 --> 01:48:02,250
The doctors give her a few more weeks.

946
01:48:07,667 --> 01:48:09,883
I say, young Albert...

947
01:48:10,542 --> 01:48:14,251
When the time comes,
would you speak at her funeral?

948
01:48:15,292 --> 01:48:17,342
That's one thing taken care of.

949
01:48:20,918 --> 01:48:22,174
<i>WW ma'!?</i>

950
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,548
You're a theatre man, aren't you?

951
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:31,590
Whenever I switch on the TV, I see...

952
01:48:31,792 --> 01:48:35,845
Scenario and script: Albert Egberts.

953
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:37,839
SEQ?

954
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:44,049
Just a few funny stories about her life.

955
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:48,844
I mean, it's a funeral
but that doesn't exclude a laugh.

956
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:55,840
Just a few anecdotes about our Tiny.
Sure you can do that?

957
01:48:58,125 --> 01:49:00,128
Yes, young Albert...

958
01:49:01,667 --> 01:49:04,001
that's all that remains of a life.

959
01:49:04,208 --> 01:49:06,128
A few anecdotes.

960
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,550
Going off for a smoke.

961
01:49:29,584 --> 01:49:33,258
Don't forget to tell them
about the chocolate egg.

962
01:49:46,584 --> 01:49:49,346
<i>What do you know of another person?</i>

963
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:51,841
<i>Precious little, unfortunately.</i>

964
01:49:53,625 --> 01:49:56,671
<i>And sometimes you wish
you didn't know anything at all.</i>

965
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:10,507
Tiny, Nico's in the mood for it.

966
01:50:34,667 --> 01:50:36,586
Come on in.

967
01:50:41,792 --> 01:50:43,427
He's at the back.

968
01:50:48,584 --> 01:50:50,385
Hi...
- Hi.

969
01:50:52,417 --> 01:50:57,964
I've invited some friends.
You know them, football or pool mates.

970
01:50:58,167 --> 01:50:59,672
Come on.

971
01:51:08,918 --> 01:51:10,636
Sit down.

972
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:19,052
Nelleke is making the coffee.
We won't be long.

973
01:51:51,918 --> 01:51:54,170
One... two...

974
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:03,334
Let the blood flow to your head
and keep your eyes closed.

975
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:13,678
Count till ten and then open them.

976
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:18,047
Do you see?

977
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:21,504
Upside down, the world looks
very different.

978
01:52:22,918 --> 01:52:26,757
More beautiful, don't you think?
- Much more beautiful.

979
01:52:26,958 --> 01:52:30,134
Something else you've learned
from your Aunt Tiny.
