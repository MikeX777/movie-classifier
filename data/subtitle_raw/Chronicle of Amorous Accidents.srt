1
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,965
Thanks.

2
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,900
Tickets, please.

3
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,850
Here.
Thanks.

4
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,520
Thanks.

5
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,295
Your ticket, please.

6
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Thanks.

7
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,350
Thanks.
Are you a student?

8
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,350
- Not yet.
- Your chin has deceived me.

9
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:53,670
- It's beautiful embroidered like a student.
- A habit before the baccalaureate.

10
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,715
I see she writes something on her.

11
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,700
"Per aspera ad astra".
School Decision.

12
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:09,550
Young... in the adjacent compartment is
an archbishop, in the flesh and bone!

13
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,960
Have you seen him?
Then do not waste time, young man!

14
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,945
- Here's how nice it is!
- Yes.

15
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,980
He doesn't see us.

16
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:50,020
- That's how it starts.
- What will happen?

17
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm coming back here all the more often.
Night...

18
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,925
- Sometimes even the day.
- Soon I will go to the world.

19
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,690
- I know everything...
- And what's waiting for me in my life?

20
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:11,280
Maybe I know that too, but
I can't say anything.

21
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,930
It's better not to know.

22
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,930
I'm coming back...
I forgot my chin in the compartment.

23
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,560
One embroidered?

24
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,825
You will not lose it, nor will
you change it with another.

25
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,610
Wicio!

26
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:36,920
- Come here.
- Mama, what the hell are you?

27
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,660
Come on, boy, come here.

28
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,490
- You're beautiful.
- Yes, Mama...

29
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,430
- You are the most beautiful.
- You make me leave...

30
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,646
Here's a birthday present, son.

31
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,250
Mama, and if I can't
get to the bitch?

32
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:07,350
- Can't you?
- Everything is possible.

33
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,700
- You must always be first.
- Don't talk nonsense, Mom.

34
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:18,100
You will be a great doctor,
a great professor.

35
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:22,180
You will care for us and heal
all, the poor and the rich...

36
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:25,330
Kings and beggars, you will care for...

37
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:30,460
- Speaking brings bad luck.
- Only the weak are scared.

38
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,680
Jadzia, my little girl...

39
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,380
What do you think, how
long will this agony last?

40
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:08,500
It will not last long, believe
me, the sky is merciful.

41
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,000
If that's what you say!
If that were the case!

42
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,760
But what's up, boy?

43
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,100
- A student cap.
- So Wicio is at the university?

44
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,215
- Nobody tells me anything?
- Not yet, Dad.

45
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,470
Now he's just getting the baccalaureate.

46
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,646
- He's in medicine in autumn.
- At Autumn?

47
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,165
Thank God!
I will not live until then.

48
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,485
Hello.

49
00:08:57,055 --> 00:09:00,050
Please go to Colonel
Nalecz with a telegram.

50
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,900
In the Military District.
I can not leave home.

51
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,285
He's arrived recently.

52
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,080
But he's tired, he's just dropped.

53
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:15,900
Tired ? Dear neighbour, all
the city envies for you.

54
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:20,085
Take my bike, and see
to sign the receipt.

55
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,030
I forgot the iron.
I have to go. Thank you.

56
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,520
Go, Wicio.
Maybe you can give people a joy.

57
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,850
A good news.

58
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,505
- Come to us?
- I have a telegram.

59
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,240
Come in, please.

60
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,155
- Who's Zosia?
- Someone from the mail with a telegram.

61
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,500
Where is it?

62
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,770
Mama, Dad comes!

63
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,700
Mammy, tomorrow dad comes!

64
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,380
I had a feeling.

65
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,015
I dreamed of a train running
on the ground, without rails.

66
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,840
Signs receipt.

67
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,830
Pass, please, and the exact
time of your receipt.

68
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,000
- Let's give him something.
- Give him 50 thick ones.

69
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,915
But here he writes "arrive", not "arrive".

70
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,745
I haven't noticed the joy.

71
00:11:57,045 --> 00:12:01,340
- Let's give him a zloty.
- Too bad people.

72
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,570
- Mother...
- I'll be 50.

73
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:08,425
- I'm going...
- Yeah, I get it.

74
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,745
Ladies, thank you and I
wish you a good night.

75
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,054
Thanks for the junk, I
hope to enrich myself.

76
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:18,395
Excuse me!

77
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,945
Did you see what happened?

78
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,130
Maybe I'm gonna fuck
you, how about?

79
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,995
Maybe it will be an unhappy love
that will bring death to me.

80
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,850
- Wicio, come tell me something.
- All right, what are you doing here?

81
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,655
- We're making it easy.
- And something else?

82
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,020
- We're doing a Japanese theatre, come on.
- I'm not in the mood.

83
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,735
Come on, come and even
ask me to bring you.

84
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,740
Mr. Wicio!
It's been a while since we haven't seen each other.

85
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,410
The mother sends you to the country
so you don't mess up the girls here.

86
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:48,900
We wouldn't give
up such a knight.

87
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,410
Don't forget I'm your fiancé.

88
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,335
Lowa, these are just empty words.

89
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,920
- What do I have of that?
- What do you mean?

90
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,920
Body Pleasure...
emancipation...

91
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,975
Stop, shameless!

92
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:22,600
Stop it!
Do we play or not play?

93
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,850
Take a look, it's jealous!

94
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,450
According to Wicio...

95
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,715
Once again, please
put that plate...

96
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,170
Not a little fucked up!

97
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,750
Seduce students...

98
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:33,240
Mama, don't be yours.
Better go to bed.

99
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,490
God... what a sad sad!

100
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,730
What a misfortune!

101
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,750
What a terrible year!

102
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,125
It is said to be war.

103
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,615
Every year this is said.

104
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,750
Did not you even
create a friend?

105
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,990
- Why me and not you?
- I have one.

106
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:27,015
- You? Who are you stupid?
- I know I do.

107
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,465
- Show me her picture.
- Now, at night?

108
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,860
- What are you watching?
- These old people are over 30,

109
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,425
They're not even young, but
they're still in love, right?

110
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,425
- Yeah, like any of us.
- Do you know anything?

111
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,040
I have so much energy in me
that I feel I'm bursting.

112
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,755
- Bring him back to Kiezun's bike.
- Yeah, I'm going.

113
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:02,010
Excuse me, I didn't know you were here.

114
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:05,775
Please, it's a free place.
You can sit down.

115
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,510
Thank you, but I go down to the first halt.

116
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,900
- You'll cool down.
- How come I haven't seen you before?

117
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,815
What if you ride this train?

118
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:22,760
- One and a half years.
- Impossible!

119
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,560
I haven't seen you before.

120
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:29,865
- Yesterday I saw you first.
- All you can.

121
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,460
In this winter, you were beaten with snow
and thumped me down the aisle, though.

122
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,990
I don't think so, I would
have remembered you.

123
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,060
And yet it is, but it does nothing.

124
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,015
Don't say that, it's not true.

125
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,185
- Do not do anything?
- No, I didn't notice you

126
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,975
Here we go down!

127
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,115
<i>Colonia Halt!</i>

128
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,850
Goodbye.

129
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,265
So, you've waited for them.
I have been watching you.

130
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:37,450
- Whichever ? Alina?
- I do not know if I like something or someone.

131
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,300
- Medicine, maybe...
- Are we?

132
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,585
- On what ?
- That you conquered yourself.

133
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,600
- Who?
- Alina.

134
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:47,145
What name...

135
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,830
- You'll like your name...
- What do you want from me?

136
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:56,875
- Are you jealous?
- Maybe... Well, are we betting?

137
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,365
- On what ?
- I do not know, if I win I'll ask you something.

138
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,150
Lowka, I think you crazed her.

139
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:10,200
- You just met her...
- He's been here for over a year?

140
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,790
- Possibly. Well, do we bet?
- What can I get from you?

141
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,975
What I'd like to gain from you.
Let's hit the palm!

142
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,945
What will be, will be.
It's done.

143
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:39,490
What is it, don't you recognize me again?

144
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:47,520
Come with me, let me spend the
night at your mistress...

145
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,300
Let me in at least...

146
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,850
- What a luck, daddy!
- All right, little girl.

147
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,880
What a good thing!

148
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:33,265
Yes, tomorrow we'll get up early.
Let's have some tea, though.

149
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,020
- Let's have some tea, though.
- Yes.

150
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,340
Just leave me inside,
don't make me hurt.

151
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:15,600
Either you eat me or I get away.

152
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,560
I know it's ugly what I do, but I
swear it's the first and last time.

153
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,895
What the hell is he doing?
It's all for nothing...

154
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,800
In vain everything.

155
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:25,235
Light up again!
You have nothing to lose!

156
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,545
You hear me?
I command you all my strength!

157
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,600
First and Last Time...
Goodbye, buddy!

158
00:25:10,565 --> 00:25:15,520
Rex! Come here, Rex!
Cunning them in the garden?

159
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,860
You mess up with me, haianao!

160
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:31,575
- Who's there ?
- Excuse me, I lost myself...

161
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,350
Where?

162
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,400
We were looking for the road to the cemetery.

163
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,315
No, sir, this leads to
the military district.

164
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,535
My mother died on a foreign
land, but he wanted it

165
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,485
to rest in the cemetery on the edge
of the forest next to the church.

166
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,475
But there is no church there.

167
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:06,850
Exact.
And no cemetery.

168
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,920
But it will be after the war.
Mr. Wicio, are you accompanying me a little?

169
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,215
I hear a radio.
You, don't you?

170
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,260
How do you know me?

171
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,420
I met you, but I don't
remember how well.

172
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:37,415
Please accompany me a little, if you are kind.

173
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,530
Today I'm crazy and I'm cured.

174
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,885
Yes, I know...
You will love yourself with dissipation, until...

175
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:52,820
- Until ?
- You'll see for yourself, it's not much.

176
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:58,490
- How do you know?
- From what I remember...

177
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,000
How many brains are there!
Soon to get bored.

178
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:09,190
Who are you?

179
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,725
Witek, I have been looking for you all night.

180
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,470
- What do you want ?
- Greta is very sick.

181
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,310
- Why don't you call a doctor?
- At this time?

182
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,960
- He's got a fever.
- I don't know.

183
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,700
But do not you learn all day ?!

184
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,725
- Are you crazy?
- You've healed Lowka.

185
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,570
- He was just constipated!
- Don't you help me?

186
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,125
- I can't.
- It's lazy!

187
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,570
If you want, I can consult
it, but what use.

188
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,655
Are you asleep?

189
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,940
- Wicio came to see you.
- But I have nothing.

190
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,640
I have been drinking some teas.
Until tomorrow I'll pass.

191
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,125
Come on, sit well.

192
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:54,465
- Say...
- Bring it. Give me a secondary watch.

193
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,415
Do you want to chew tomorrow?

194
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,690
Give me your hand.

195
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,960
No temperature.

196
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,835
It couldn't, it was like a stove.

197
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,215
She wanted to call you.

198
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,970
I didn't want it!

199
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,360
How is it!
Raise your shirt, immortal!

200
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,600
- I don't want !
- Come on, come on, Berlin!

201
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,915
- I don't want !
"Are you just listening, or are you ashamed?"

202
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,915
Come on, fuck it!

203
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,675
I cannot hear anything.

204
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,400
But something else?

205
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:22,370
- Anything else, leave me cold.
- What you said ?

206
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:27,530
- Ninic, I think he has nothing.
- Doesn't he have anything?

207
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,240
- Is that healthy?
- So it seems.

208
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:38,300
- You just knew.
- Then why did you want a doctor?

209
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,260
You're a fool.
It's okay with your head!

210
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:49,095
- Pay attention !
- I don't care what you are!

211
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,230
Aren't you ashamed?
Dare to make me a German?

212
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:06,865
How scary!
Look what my eyes are.

213
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,210
I just have to change
this idiot name.

214
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,465
What's wrong, son?

215
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,345
- Hell!
- What you said ?

216
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,440
- Hell!
- I don't understand!

217
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:34,050
You better stop, prusacule!

218
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,995
It's been so many years and you
haven't taught this language yet!

219
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:52,570
What do you want me to tell you?
Wladislaw Drewnowski?

220
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:54,580
Wladislaw Drewnowski, is not it?

221
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,660
- Do you know anything?
- No.

222
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,395
- You're doing well.
- I'm fine?

223
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,485
- Yes, you!
- You going crazy, Engel?

224
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,580
Not Engel, Wladek!

225
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:08,060
What did you mean by that?
What this means?

226
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,445
- Fuck you!
- What's up with you?

227
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,270
Listen to me!
Hear my commandments!

228
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,750
I'm a mean, cold, lover of love.

229
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:23,300
But if I still courage,
you have to listen to me

230
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,885
Listen to me, you must
come to me immediately.

231
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:30,475
I have been ticking today for you.

232
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:39,190
Number up to ten.
One, two, three, four, five, six...

233
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:47,930
Seven, seven and a half,
eight, eight and a quarter...

234
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,775
I order you for the
last time to come here.

235
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,240
If you do not do what I say, you'll
be spending your whole life.

236
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:14,865
Either... it means I do
not have to command you.

237
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,520
Please, then, I beg you with all
my heart, listen to me and come.

238
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:24,620
"And if not, I will curse
you, you will see!"

239
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,750
Hello.

240
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:34,720
- You kissed me, and I came.
- But I didn't want to...

241
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,700
How, I just felt the fluid...

242
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:43,905
- And then I was gone.
- That... that's a mistake.

243
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,135
- I know, but I brought you the book.
- What book?

244
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,250
- "Notions of Chemistry". Don't you recognise her?
- No...

245
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:59,910
- No... I don't know.
- But it's yours.

246
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,200
Maybe he doesn't remember.
Anyway, thank you.

247
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,900
I had the impression that
you were waiting for me.

248
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:14,290
Ced I dreamed you last night.
On the word!

249
00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:19,735
I don't know how exactly, but
I have dreamed you exactly.

250
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,015
It's an error...

251
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,175
You said that again.
But I am a very good environment.

252
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:29,450
It's strange, isn't it?

253
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,165
I was sick and I left
the last two hours.

254
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,680
- It's the first time I come here.
- And for the first time.

255
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,755
You see?
It's a weird thing,

256
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,280
Yeah, it's very weird.

257
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:53,130
- Can I stay a little longer? I'm tired.
- Sure you do.

258
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,560
- You haven't even seen me before?
- I'm a busy man, I work a lot.

259
00:35:57,575 --> 00:36:02,470
- I want to study medicine.
- And my father is a doctor.

260
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:04,335
Your cousin studying?

261
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:11,285
- Right, but he broke his studies.
- Has he interrupted his studies?

262
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:17,030
An unfortunate love story...

263
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,225
- I'm an egocentric.
- Here?

264
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,426
Nothing... sin.

265
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:28,630
Not at all, I'm a real monster...
a selfish one.

266
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,960
- Like me.
- Impossible.

267
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:33,300
Then we're going to bother each other.

268
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,425
Yeah... do you think so?

269
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,790
- Where did you lose your book?
- Where did you find it?

270
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:18,370
Don't we go down to town?

271
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:22,180
- We can get rid of the unseen.
- I'm lucky.

272
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:25,635
- So good.
- It's good and bad.

273
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,600
- Why is it bad?
- Because luck is being paid.

274
00:37:29,985 --> 00:37:31,335
And how do you plan to pay?

275
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,590
Once, with a high price.
I'm going to die young.

276
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,600
- It's up to you now to want to die young.
- And you?

277
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,265
And I, but I can't, I
still have some problems.

278
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:52,045
To show you a great place.

279
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,600
Really... it's nice here.

280
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm not breathing anymore.

281
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,055
God, how beautiful she is!

282
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,720
- Did you know I like the ice cream?
- Not me.

283
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:51,115
Take yours too.
Don't ruin my pleasure.

284
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,255
- Nothing can convince me.
- I throw it on you.

285
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,900
So, life is not the worst thing...

286
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:08,765
May...
I often change my opinions.

287
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,800
I'll think about it.

288
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,540
- What are you thinking about now?
- To you, of course.

289
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:23,590
It's not worth it.

290
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,845
I apologise...

291
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,850
Don't do anything. It's late.
I have to go back. You?

292
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,360
I have to stay, but I still
have little to do with it.

293
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,915
- I think I was terrible.
- Don't do anything.

294
00:39:57,515 --> 00:39:59,745
It's typical of cold-hearted.

295
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,525
- So you want to leave?
- I don't want it, but I have to.

296
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,465
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

297
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,930
He has to turn his head.
Like a good sign.

298
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,295
Attention!

299
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:01,415
<i>Either the plains of the spring</i>

300
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,539
<i>And the green mountains and the valleys</i>

301
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,480
<i>Shadows or shady dumbbells</i>

302
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,535
<i>And the springs and streams
in the eternal movement.</i>

303
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,230
Mr Witek!

304
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,540
Witek!

305
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,005
- Where are you going ?
- See who's calling me.

306
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:47,770
- We both know who.
- Mom, you must!

307
00:41:47,915 --> 00:41:49,935
I tell her you're not home.

308
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:55,275
- Mom, I'm no longer a child.
- Yes, you are.

309
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,740
Wicio, I have a bad feeling.

310
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:05,805
- Mammy, I know what I'm doing.
- That's not a company for you.

311
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,480
Wicio!

312
00:42:12,925 --> 00:42:16,380
Hello.
Are we disturbing you?

313
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:21,550
- Not at all, I just finished learning.
- My cousin, Silwek... Mr. Wicio.

314
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,720
- Pleasant.
- That's what we see.

315
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,840
Don't ignore what he says.

316
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:39,090
How long will that fence support?

317
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,195
Mr. Wicio, come with us to the river?

318
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,000
I'd come, but I don't have a bicycle.

319
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:51,065
- It's okay, I'm on the frame.
- Let's try.

320
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:12,350
- Rex, come here.
- I would prefer it further.

321
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,000
- Not so fast!
- I can even slow down.

322
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:34,480
- Are you mad at me?
- From where to where ?

323
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:06,065
- Do you want to study medicine?
- Yeah, I'm getting ready for medicine.

324
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,535
Do you want to treat the rich?

325
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,132
The rich, but
especially the poor.

326
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:16,075
Start with the poor and
end up with the rich.

327
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,815
- We're trying our powers?
- If that's what you want...

328
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,520
- Only if you have courage.
- I like to risk.

329
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,000
I trust the grievous, young.

330
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,440
- Fight for Alina.
- I can't!

331
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,130
- Leave us! Going here?
- Yes, it works.

332
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:49,670
I don't support these silly turns!
Mr. Witek, be wise.

333
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:59,035
Mr. Witek, come here right
away, or you'll regret it!

334
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,245
- Let's have a tutorial. Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

335
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,965
What a power it has!
Broke my bones!

336
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:53,155
- Of course he broke them!
- I am sorry.

337
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,115
You won, you belong.

338
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,590
- Has anyone asked me?
- Be quiet.

339
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,400
- Not for fighting.
- But for whom?

340
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,025
For nobody...
For absolutely nothing,

341
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,350
Now I'll fall asleep.

342
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:22,945
- And I'll sleep...
- That's a nice day.

343
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:29,300
But anyway, I will not fall asleep anyway.

344
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,540
And I'm gonna hurt myself until morning.

345
00:46:34,815 --> 00:46:38,965
I don't have air, it's cold,
I'm thinking too many,

346
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,430
thoughtless thoughts,
dreams and hopelessness...

347
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,705
that make my heart beat.
And it suddenly envelops me.

348
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:51,270
But you have the pills.
I got you a bottle today.

349
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,470
- I wish you didn't make misconceptions.
- I did not.

350
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,600
- I really did not have an idea.
- But you're weird about me.

351
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:45,040
I could just take all
the pills and sleep...

352
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:50,570
By the end of the world.

353
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,320
- Suicide is a great sin.
- What a shame?

354
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,605
It is greater sin to thrive you to
live if you do not want it any more.

355
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,660
I don't know what to say.

356
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,025
When we do not know anything, we
have to take an example from nature.

357
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,725
That is, fear, the fear
of living, to face life.

358
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,020
Who knows, once and for all,
people will be able to...

359
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,025
Some motivated requests to
obtain the right to death.

360
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,330
- Are you going bad?
- That's not what I said.

361
00:48:30,005 --> 00:48:32,625
Get your hands off me, mucus!

362
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:37,600
I did it for pure affection, grasunico.

363
00:48:38,555 --> 00:48:43,745
Mouth, or I'm moving your fingers!
I have had enough !

364
00:48:45,565 --> 00:48:47,965
Have you ever said a
beautiful word to a woman?

365
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:54,100
That you love her, you want her...
Are you crazy after her?

366
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,125
I can say that any time.

367
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:05,560
- Go ahead !
- Can you tell you?

368
00:49:05,785 --> 00:49:11,835
- Why not ?
- But they will all hear.

369
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,300
And why not hear?

370
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,900
I love you.

371
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,890
He wanted it!

372
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,200
No shame!

373
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,370
- I should feel offended.
- Teach you.

374
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,100
Another day to keep
your dignity, Lowka!

375
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,180
I feel like I'm going crazy, I
think someday I'll explode.

376
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,740
How do I see a skirt, how do I go crazy.

377
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,375
When the wind blows in the girls'
hair, when I see an empty foot...

378
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,740
I feel like I'm suffocating.
The worst, however, is the night

379
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:05,780
- It will pass...
- And I'm still dead on that I'm gonna think.

380
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,545
- What a disaster!
- We all go through this.

381
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,690
- And you?
- And I, but they do not hurt me.

382
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,020
But if I stay so long, I die.

383
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,225
- Did Engel tell you?
- He did not say anything to me.

384
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:28,500
Dad wants to send me to
Germany when school finishes.

385
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,400
- What happened ?
- Still nothing.

386
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,685
- She's afraid of a fool.
- There will be no war!

387
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,025
That's what has always been said.

388
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,380
Who to fight? Who?
Me and Engel? Engel with me?

389
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,645
Engel, are we going to fight each other?

390
00:50:51,945 --> 00:50:54,600
We will live long and well to death.

391
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:00,715
We're going to get back to 2,000.
Don't you think?

392
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,006
What a wonderful night...
Weird...

393
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,725
A huge mass of birds floats
the park above the city.

394
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,955
Are you there yet?

395
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,745
- All right, all at bedtime.
- What's the matter with you?

396
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:25,430
Where are my pills?

397
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,170
- The park was here.
- How will I sleep without them?

398
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,635
They were here on the table.

399
00:51:48,945 --> 00:51:52,640
Did any of you take the pills?

400
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,790
For what ?
We sleep with and without them,

401
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,820
We'll buy some more tomorrow.

402
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,390
- We're going over this night.
- Nonsense!

403
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:13,965
- I'm equal if I sleep or not.
- Then why are you crying?

404
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,790
I don't know... it came to me.

405
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:30,745
- Every year, the same.
- We're in 1939.

406
00:52:31,925 --> 00:52:33,355
I can't even believe how time goes by...

407
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,340
Good night, ladies.

408
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,840
Good night.

409
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,050
- Leaves !
- You have no shame!

410
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,915
- Witek, you sleeping without pills?
- Yes.

411
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,100
I, without my pills,
can't sleep.

412
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,200
Good night.

413
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,745
Ready!

414
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,830
I love you!

415
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:57,900
Are you, Rex?

416
00:53:59,325 --> 00:54:00,825
Are you spying on me?
Why?

417
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,300
Grandpa, can you hear me?
I fell in love.

418
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:49,750
Yes, it was something like that...
Why would you drag?

419
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:55,765
But I can not remember
it well, son.

420
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:01,595
I'm in love, Grandpa.

421
00:55:03,155 --> 00:55:08,040
Okay, it's fine...
Nobody died of it yet.

422
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:12,065
Maybe I will be the first to die.

423
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:07,095
- Why are you torturing me like that?
- Do I bother you?

424
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,705
You torture yourself.

425
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,830
- Can I drive you to the train?
- If you want...

426
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:29,440
Don't you see anything?
Don't you see what a stab wound?

427
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,950
I broke my head because
of you and you.

428
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,740
You talk stupid things and you
lose your sense of humour.

429
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:49,515
- I can afford, we do not have witnesses.
- You're ridiculous.

430
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,050
- That's how you'll always be.
- How are you?

431
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,335
- You know.
- How do I know?

432
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:59,200
You noticed me in secret.

433
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,165
You drive me only to the corner of the street.
Only there!

434
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,840
Do you know there will be war?

435
00:58:17,185 --> 00:58:18,550
Why aren't you saying anything ?

436
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,565
Now, thank you...
And goodbye.

437
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,390
Allow me... can you let me
drive you to the garage?

438
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:35,285
- So you don't want to ?
- I don't want.

439
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,450
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

440
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,055
We have to meet again.

441
00:58:56,745 --> 00:59:00,475
- For the last time, it's very important.
- We just broke up.

442
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:04,955
I have to talk to you.
I expect you six in front of your house.

443
00:59:06,385 --> 00:59:10,565
- In front of the house?
- Yes, I beg you. For the last time.

444
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,600
- How do you want...
- Does that mean yes?

445
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:58,565
God, in fact, nothing happened.

446
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,370
I will go crazy !

447
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:16,565
So here it was hidden!

448
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:23,200
I caught you, you were gone. Recognise!
Don't you want to admit it?

449
01:00:23,405 --> 01:00:25,490
Rcunosc.
And what if?

450
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:28,480
- And our bet?
- What bet?

451
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:32,350
- Stop doing the innocent!
- Are you stupid?

452
01:00:33,835 --> 01:00:37,935
- Where have you been all day ?
- What's up with you, it's my job.

453
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,735
I got his hand!

454
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:00,900
Witek, you know she's sick.
They did X-ray.

455
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:04,405
- He's got a big heart.
- Many live well with the big heart.

456
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:08,970
- Do you have anything with her?
- What are you up to? I have nothing with her.

457
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:13,505
- Then it's good, no one to hurt her.
- Who's hurt her?

458
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,240
Witek, do you hear?

459
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,000
Yes, I hear.

460
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,850
- I wanted to apologise.
- For what ?

461
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:46,460
- For everything.
- Okay, but you don't have it for what.

462
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,520
You treat me like a child.

463
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,185
Engel does everything in my account always.

464
01:01:57,315 --> 01:02:00,400
- Greta, but it's not a big deal.
- For me it is.

465
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,960
Why did you bring me here?

466
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,240
I don't know, that's how it was.

467
01:02:29,715 --> 01:02:32,435
What do you want to tell me ?
I'm curious.

468
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,970
I can't tell you that all of a sudden.

469
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,410
Then we wait a little longer.

470
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,900
- Who did you rust for?
- Did I bother?

471
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:40,680
- For me, or for your cousin?
- For me.

472
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,700
Show me your hands...

473
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,500
- You still have a long way to live.
- No!

474
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,455
My road stops here.
See? Next to this milling.

475
01:04:43,835 --> 01:04:46,965
Alina!
Alina, what happened?

476
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,180
Alina!
Wait for me!

477
01:04:51,635 --> 01:04:52,900
Alina, wait for me!

478
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,410
Here he must have fallen.

479
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,140
If I find my coin, everything
will be good again

480
01:05:21,955 --> 01:05:23,645
Only here could I lose her.

481
01:05:30,515 --> 01:05:31,965
I'll look for her until I find her.

482
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,405
- And if you don't find her?
- Are you spying on me?

483
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,645
Possible.
Fr, you lost your bet.

484
01:05:46,285 --> 01:05:49,365
- This isn't something to bet.
- What's with you?

485
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:54,830
- You lost and you have to pay.
- How do you know?

486
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,880
- The whole city talks to you and Alina.
- How do I pay for you?

487
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,855
I'll give you three legs in the ass.

488
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,450
- Lowka, jokes!
- I just bet, have you forgot?

489
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:15,580
- You're not going to tell anyone?
- I have my honour too.

490
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,110
Then go ahead.

491
01:06:54,035 --> 01:06:55,090
Lowka, leave the jokes!

492
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,750
Leo Tigerovich, get up!
You want to scare me?

493
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:11,900
What...
What happened?

494
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,400
God!
My tooth is shaking.

495
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:21,450
- Who are you?
- I'm Lowka.

496
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,775
Wait a minute...

497
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,080
Thank God!
Come with me?

498
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:32,360
Where?

499
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:36,450
To the Baum sisters.
What did you forget?

500
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,365
It's just waiting for you.
Come on, I can't go alone.

501
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:48,030
- Come, I brought something...
- What?

502
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,600
Have...

503
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,425
I have... harsh grasses.

504
01:07:58,905 --> 01:08:02,250
- Today I decided to go to action.
- What do you want to do?

505
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,300
I looked for him and I found him.

506
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,120
I brought you the wrong owl.

507
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:16,455
- So only can the force be brought?
- No questions.

508
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,865
- You were there?
He prayed on his knees under a tree.

509
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:25,690
Come to drink from the elixir of forgetfulness.
Come, don't be stubborn.

510
01:08:25,725 --> 01:08:30,175
It's not nice to
refuse an older lady.

511
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:35,805
Drink it to the bottom and it
will open your third eye...

512
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:41,650
- You'll see better.
- I like it too.

513
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:46,290
Bea, Wicio!

514
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,830
- Maybe we will not see each other again.
- Why don't we see each other again?

515
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:52,770
You know why.

516
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:57,385
And I drink for the first time.

517
01:08:59,445 --> 01:09:01,300
Then, in the beauty of
the beautiful ladies!

518
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,980
- Which one?
- All... And mine.

519
01:09:14,355 --> 01:09:16,725
I have begun to see
with my third eye.

520
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,510
And I started to feel...
a slight nausea.

521
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,100
But it is a delight.
Nonsense...

522
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,365
Dance with me?

523
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,065
I wanted...
I wanted to break my bad luck.

524
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,450
Then you had to throw him harder.

525
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,480
I didn't know.
And now what will happen?

526
01:10:34,165 --> 01:10:35,820
You will definitely be happy.

527
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:42,675
- How do you know?
- I think we'll all be happy.

528
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:49,005
The next month I'm leaving.

529
01:10:50,615 --> 01:10:54,920
- What idea !
- Dad's afraid of a war.

530
01:10:59,015 --> 01:11:02,785
Engelbarth, my dear...

531
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,645
It's already very late.

532
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:15,920
Father, let me stay
for an hour, please.

533
01:11:21,785 --> 01:11:25,975
You know, I'm a...

534
01:11:28,365 --> 01:11:31,745
a bad, gruff, but in fact...

535
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:37,620
I am no longer German and
I will not be any more.

536
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,500
I don't understand you any more.

537
01:11:41,175 --> 01:11:45,000
A wise old man drinks so
much wine and generally...

538
01:11:45,695 --> 01:11:46,845
Generally, what?

539
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,870
In general, so many...

540
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,685
Look at Engel as he looks...

541
01:11:55,425 --> 01:11:57,725
Does he look like a young man how should he?

542
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:03,445
He is no longer German, but
neither Polish will be.

543
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,535
Greta... I think I'm sorry.

544
01:12:07,285 --> 01:12:08,630
I see everything on the pieces.

545
01:12:10,485 --> 01:12:14,150
And I'm sorry.
Let's get out of the air.

546
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,785
- I can't do this anymore !
- I have been drinking for the first time in my life.

547
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,755
- Why is everything rotating with me?
- I thought it was different.

548
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:34,675
- What are you saying?
- I'm thinking about my life.

549
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,120
- Just now ?
- Maybe we'll die from this wine.

550
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:42,350
- Maybe it was poisoned.
- I wouldn't allow that!

551
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:44,800
First I would die!

552
01:12:48,445 --> 01:12:49,700
Kiss Me !

553
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,775
- Not that...
- I am sorry.

554
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,345
He's very nice.

555
01:13:23,805 --> 01:13:28,060
Not worse than others.
She has exactly the same breasts...

556
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,630
exactly the same body...

557
01:13:32,365 --> 01:13:33,735
exactly the same hips...

558
01:13:34,685 --> 01:13:37,345
exact...
So what happens to me?

559
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,860
What happens?

560
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,470
Monthly Sinister...

561
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:20,415
What is it?

562
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,370
Do you hear my heart beating?

563
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,355
What are you looking for?

564
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,850
It's not good at all.

565
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:41,415
It hurts me very badly,
but I don't know why.

566
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:46,635
- What are you looking for in the drawer?
- The Father's Acts.

567
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:51,430
- Whose father?
- Yours.

568
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,100
There's a decoration
he got in the war

569
01:15:54,305 --> 01:15:59,910
for acts of bravery and heroism,
era and a sheet of paper...

570
01:15:59,911 --> 01:16:00,911
imprinted with the black
letters of the front desk

571
01:16:01,212 --> 01:16:10,315
bearing the energetic signature
of General Szeptycki.

572
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:15,300
- He was over here.
- There are a lot of old papers and pictures here.

573
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:20,295
Yes, but I can't find
the old German documents.

574
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,645
Workbook, identity card...

575
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,525
- The partisan card.
- That's something I didn't see.

576
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,065
You are right...

577
01:16:32,275 --> 01:16:34,780
These are no longer.

578
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:40,445
- But the pictures?
- I don't know...

579
01:16:40,746 --> 01:16:42,935
There is a passport photo here.

580
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:48,520
But the others?
Maybe they destroyed your mother, afraid.

581
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:52,355
- Here's a picture of Dad.
- See?

582
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:58,355
An absolutely common face like
anyone else on the street.

583
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,550
I can't remember it anymore.

584
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:06,485
Does it express meekness, pride?
Was he sympathetic?

585
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:11,395
What did she think, what did she want?
Who did he really love?

586
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:15,505
- Do you know?
- I didn't think about that.

587
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:21,205
- Will you still miss it?
- Why did you come here?

588
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:23,725
Don't inspire fear, do you?

589
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:28,320
Maybe I'm a spirit that
just feels terrible,

590
01:17:28,325 --> 01:17:33,465
is struggling...
Trying to make sense of the absurd?

591
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,720
But what do I want to say...

592
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,295
It is that I can't change your fate.

593
01:17:40,825 --> 01:17:43,750
I'm not interested in my future.

594
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,330
Is Renia the one
having a long, black,

595
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,900
or Niusia, hit by a bomb?

596
01:17:51,955 --> 01:17:58,595
No, I think he did not
die, he went to Stockholm.

597
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:03,055
- Then he never heard of her.
- My name is Alina.

598
01:18:05,535 --> 01:18:11,190
- Is that so bad?
- It's for the first time in my life.

599
01:18:11,335 --> 01:18:14,715
- I'm taking my picture with me.
- Take it.

600
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,860
Let me be lucky.

601
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:31,445
Though I don't
need luck in fact.

602
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,125
Are you?

603
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:48,805
Do you come home this time?

604
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:54,580
No, I woke up from my sleep.
I was awakened.

605
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:57,635
What are you doing?
What you say?

606
01:18:59,265 --> 01:19:05,325
He took it there, among the trees.
Mama, look at it! There!

607
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:12,660
There's nobody there.

608
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:19,835
Soon it's day.
You haunt day and night you don't sleep.

609
01:19:20,036 --> 01:19:23,450
- I have seen it before.
- And you say that, simple?

610
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,755
- It's not terrifying.
- What ghosts were in my time!

611
01:19:26,956 --> 01:19:30,095
And that's true, but he does
not want anything from us.

612
01:19:30,396 --> 01:19:34,460
You drank?
God, he's started!

613
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:37,980
- Did you take my 50 pockets out of my pocket?
- What were they looking for?

614
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,485
- Next to a talisman?
- Good luck.

615
01:19:41,486 --> 01:19:43,435
- I know well...
- Give it to me!

616
01:19:43,636 --> 01:19:48,260
- Shall I give it to you? I threw her into the river.
- You're superstitious.

617
01:19:48,461 --> 01:19:50,290
Wicio, it's for your sake.

618
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,245
You have to be strong,
you can't crash.

619
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:59,160
Mom, my life belongs to me.

620
01:20:00,515 --> 01:20:03,640
They talk and walk
all night and night.

621
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:08,155
I'm doing something, and
I only know nothing.

622
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:10,965
Only nobody tells me anything.

623
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:37,335
- Are you, Wicio?
- Yeah, I can't sleep.

624
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,910
Did you open the window?

625
01:20:39,975 --> 01:20:43,330
- My mom has a snake skin under my bed.
- Nonsense!

626
01:20:43,785 --> 01:20:47,485
Every day he prays, he boils
all kinds of herbs...

627
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:51,875
- Hang on the price.
- Did you hear the nightingale?

628
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:54,750
I hear everything.

629
01:20:55,485 --> 01:21:00,935
Now I'm just a big, dying ear.

630
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:04,385
- Don't you sleep, Grandpa?
- I stay awake...

631
01:21:04,386 --> 01:21:06,730
I'm awake, son.

632
01:21:10,225 --> 01:21:12,810
And if I die before you?

633
01:21:14,345 --> 01:21:15,670
What do you say there ?

634
01:21:31,075 --> 01:21:36,525
Scuzaþi me...
Hello, Zuza.

635
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,135
- Here you go.
- No, thank you.

636
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,090
I'd like to tell you
something between four eyes.

637
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:58,060
- What ?
- I want to ask you what's wrong with Alina.

638
01:21:58,475 --> 01:22:02,800
- With Alina?
- I gave him a book I need now.

639
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,340
Go to it.
He's in bed, he's cold.

640
01:22:07,695 --> 01:22:12,290
That was... I did not know...
Yeah, I'll go over to her.

641
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:19,725
- That's a lot easier.
- I'm not the man of simple solutions.

642
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:24,935
But I'm afraid yours
will not enjoy too much.

643
01:22:25,136 --> 01:22:28,490
- But she ?
- That's what you know better.

644
01:22:30,015 --> 01:22:32,350
- Now it's too late.
- Why is it late?

645
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,075
Now it's all.

646
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,115
- What is it ?
- A telegram for the lady.

647
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,065
I sign.

648
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,960
- I have to hand it to her personally.
- I said I signed up!

649
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:13,865
- No, Miss Alina!
- Stay in your room!

650
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:18,635
- I sign the receipt.
- No, I cant!

651
01:23:18,936 --> 01:23:22,275
- Give it to me!
- No, I cant!

652
01:23:24,315 --> 01:23:27,895
- Give it back to me!
- Give me the receipt to sign it.

653
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:31,940
- Give it to me!
- Don't you need a receipt?

654
01:23:31,945 --> 01:23:35,585
- No, it's a telegram for Alina!
- I'll show you, mucus!

655
01:23:36,115 --> 01:23:40,830
- I'll slash your ass with salt!
- What's up?

656
01:23:40,835 --> 01:23:43,850
What you said ?
Donkey!

657
01:23:51,045 --> 01:23:54,475
What are you doing ? Are you crazy?
What did you get?

658
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:03,620
- Go too far!
- He always comes with fake telegrams!

659
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,475
I'm losing it with salt!

660
01:25:12,945 --> 01:25:16,525
- There's no point in coming.
- Did she send you?

661
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:20,240
No, but I know everything.

662
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,930
- Why doesn't he want it any more?
- He is not allowed.

663
01:25:24,425 --> 01:25:28,125
- After the baccalaureate goes abroad.
- In a few days...

664
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:30,860
- Yes...
- And what am l going to do?

665
01:25:31,455 --> 01:25:34,200
- It's going to be a war.
- I don't care.

666
01:25:34,205 --> 01:25:36,250
If I don't see it, I'm going crazy!

667
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:41,370
- She may think it's just a crap.
- And if not?

668
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:44,480
Maybe that's what you say,
but maybe she doesn't.

669
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:51,555
Mr. Witold! Mr. Witold!
I think she suffers a lot.

670
01:25:58,935 --> 01:26:00,255
Alina!

671
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,100
Alina!

672
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:13,965
Alina!

673
01:26:23,825 --> 01:26:26,050
Alina!

674
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,700
God help me!

675
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,670
What are you doing ?
Are you still alive?

676
01:27:43,975 --> 01:27:47,485
- What are you up to?
- I know he bloated you with salt.

677
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,800
Listen to me, spit on
this place and go home.

678
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:56,465
Your mama is waiting for you.
Their bourgeois don't make two money.

679
01:27:56,475 --> 01:27:58,815
- Do you know an obese girl?
- No.

680
01:28:00,185 --> 01:28:03,570
You have no pride if you
stand here begging.

681
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:07,490
Better take a bottle of
gas and fire everything.

682
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:13,985
- Why does that impress you?
- But then, why are you with them?

683
01:28:14,785 --> 01:28:20,025
Take a look at what a gerlos is!
Okay, I got a message for you.

684
01:28:21,215 --> 01:28:26,085
Alina waits for you at midday at the river.

685
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,010
- Aren't you happy ?
- You want to get rid of me ?

686
01:28:31,255 --> 01:28:33,070
Do you see it at the window?

687
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:52,075
What are you sneaking
around this house, son?

688
01:28:52,705 --> 01:28:55,395
I know what I do.
Everything will be alright.

689
01:28:58,170 --> 01:28:59,795
Let's go.

690
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,400
I dreamed a big fire.
Everything burns...

691
01:29:05,885 --> 01:29:11,530
- The house, the city, the whole world.
- No, I'm staying here.

692
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:17,425
- I'm going to get it until they all get up.
- I know, mama,

693
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:24,800
But stay here and don't force me,
otherwise something terrible will happen.

694
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:28,035
Swear to come back.

695
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,130
Jur.

696
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,680
I brought your coat.

697
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:46,030
Okay, leave him, but now
go, leave me alone.

698
01:31:58,425 --> 01:32:04,195
- What are you doing, what have you been up to?
- You should have left me alone!

699
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,775
Did I start everything?
You were the one.

700
01:32:10,945 --> 01:32:13,265
- Now it's too late.
- Why is it too late?

701
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,245
You know too well.

702
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:19,690
Right after the baccalaureate
we get married.

703
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,275
You're crazy.
My guy will not let me.

704
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,810
Now it's too late.

705
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:37,350
- What do you look for?
- Who?

706
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:41,005
- Cousin! But tell me the truth.
- What are they looking for?

707
01:32:41,006 --> 01:32:45,500
Rex!
Where did you get a bitch?

708
01:32:50,245 --> 01:32:51,685
Maybe he cherished me.

709
01:32:57,020 --> 01:33:00,575
And don't forget that... to me!

710
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,090
Now it's too late.

711
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:09,915
Cucumber, tell me how much I'll live.

712
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,980
How long will we live?

713
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:18,240
See?
We will not live too much.

714
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,885
Number of years!

715
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:27,510
Five... six... seven...

716
01:33:49,695 --> 01:33:55,380
- 42, 43, 44...
- It's enough, I don't want more.

717
01:33:56,635 --> 01:33:57,980
We don't need prophecy.

718
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,645
I wish you, I conquered you.
Now it's too late.

719
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,690
The cuckoo says we have
many years ahead of us.

720
01:34:09,115 --> 01:34:11,625
- Where have you been to meet you?
- But you?

721
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,300
It's from too much sun.

722
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,210
Stay so...
I'll make you shade.

723
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:50,410
- Mor!
- No!

724
01:34:51,065 --> 01:34:52,540
You're just getting up to life.

725
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:00,385
Where have we been before?
How do I know everything?

726
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,950
- When did we last that?
- No...

727
01:35:04,715 --> 01:35:08,695
Wait yet, not yet, please.
My heart struggles.

728
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,840
Where have we been, so long?

729
01:35:26,915 --> 01:35:32,150
- Do we run together?
- Somewhere in a university city.

730
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,145
- You'll be the biggest doctor.
- And you, his wife.

731
01:35:39,225 --> 01:35:42,645
- Is that love?
- It's impossible not to love me.

732
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:47,005
- We are the best.
- And Silvek?

733
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:53,605
- Silvek? It's some kind of surgeon.
- Why?

734
01:35:53,806 --> 01:35:57,780
He used to meditate
and so he cherished

735
01:35:57,781 --> 01:36:00,715
but a high school
girl was Jewish.

736
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:06,135
- When will there be no differences?
- There will always be differences.

737
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:11,435
- What are we doing now ?
- We're darting, or our dad kills us.

738
01:36:15,325 --> 01:36:17,485
We meet here the day the
results are displayed.

739
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,045
- Good-bye, my husband.
- Goodbye, my wife.

740
01:36:23,555 --> 01:36:25,510
Don't follow me, I
have to go back alone.

741
01:36:38,115 --> 01:36:40,865
He has to turn around.
It will be a good sign.

742
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:53,180
You came back ?
This is good.

743
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,750
I know, everything will be fine again.
I know.

744
01:36:56,860 --> 01:37:01,640
- Drink tea before bedtime.
- You think he's helping?

745
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,240
You have to keep up before
the baccalaureate exam.

746
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:13,810
Grandpa is better.
Today he ate a plate full of soup.

747
01:37:16,966 --> 01:37:20,090
And he listened to the nightingale singing.

748
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:30,830
- Mama, does life really have a purpose?
- If you do that, it's good.

749
01:37:30,835 --> 01:37:34,075
- It would be faster than the week.
- Sleep...

750
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,900
One week you missed exams.

751
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:44,475
And where will I be then?

752
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,000
Witek, what's going on with you?

753
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,060
Why aren't you saying anything?

754
01:38:39,135 --> 01:38:41,080
No, you can't.
You fell?

755
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:45,150
Say something !
Did you fall to the baccalaureate?

756
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:56,715
Look what the mask I got from my dad.

757
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,290
A real gas mask.

758
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:06,245
- What's going to happen now?
- I don't know.

759
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,570
- You're lucky.
- I don't even know what to say.

760
01:39:11,765 --> 01:39:16,560
- You can try again next year.
- I will not be in the year.

761
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:25,680
- It's my fault ?
- Neither you nor mine.

762
01:39:26,355 --> 01:39:28,450
Do you love me?

763
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:33,080
Why was I the one you
stopped suddenly then?

764
01:39:35,835 --> 01:39:39,755
- You regret it?
- No, I'm ready for anything.

765
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,580
- What do you mean ?
- Everything.

766
01:39:42,455 --> 01:39:43,840
Someone is waiting for us.

767
01:39:50,445 --> 01:39:53,790
E Rex.
Come here, next to us.

768
01:40:07,045 --> 01:40:08,200
Let's get poisoned!

769
01:40:09,675 --> 01:40:11,920
I bother you and you, me.

770
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:18,380
- Don't you scare eternity?
- Along with you, no.

771
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:24,715
- It's better to die out of love.
- Yeah, it's better.

772
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:30,730
- I'm coming tomorrow, here in a white dress.
- Why white?

773
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:44,845
- Until the last moment...
- Until the beginning of eternity.

774
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,655
Witek!

775
01:41:37,255 --> 01:41:39,775
Witold!
I was looking for you.

776
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:46,865
Do you want to marry yourself?

777
01:41:46,966 --> 01:41:50,860
Leave him alone.
He also has his problems.

778
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,760
Witold, Witold...
What are you doing?

779
01:41:57,170 --> 01:42:00,860
- He's leaving and who knows when he's coming back.
- Greta, is that it?

780
01:42:01,965 --> 01:42:04,270
You forgot ?
What's going on with you?

781
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:13,970
- Do you hear the hammer?
- I will not say anything.

782
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:18,565
You'll see, I'll get drunk
with beer or beer...

783
01:42:18,825 --> 01:42:21,860
I will be scandalous...

784
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:27,710
- And finally they're gonna blow me at the hospice.
- What did you say, pigeon?

785
01:42:30,045 --> 01:42:34,260
<i>It's our last day together</i>

786
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:37,910
<i>Because today we will be separated</i>

787
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:39,675
<i>Because today...</i>

788
01:42:43,445 --> 01:42:46,100
- And she packed.
- Who?

789
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:47,101
Alina!
The ordinance handed out the whole day of luggage.

790
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:51,205
- When it leaves ?
- At night.

791
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:53,940
Goes to Krakow.
Better said in Lvov.

792
01:43:00,285 --> 01:43:05,045
God!
You're crazy, pigeon!

793
01:43:08,135 --> 01:43:08,900
Come on!

794
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,400
Get up!
Faster !

795
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:18,720
What have you filled these suitcases with?
They are so heavy!

796
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:22,775
With black feelings and
five fears of fear.

797
01:43:26,035 --> 01:43:27,500
This is...

798
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:38,675
I have been hooked up with these suitcases.

799
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:44,105
- Goodbye.
- Get back fast, I'll wait for you.

800
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:47,139
After the war we will
find a knight to honour.

801
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:48,975
Don't fuck!

802
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:54,210
Who wants war? There will be no war.
It's just a little bang.

803
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,905
Turn around, white goose.

804
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,770
- Stop it!
- He went crazy!

805
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:22,725
I have succeeded.
A good sign.

806
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:25,580
But what does he use to me?

807
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,335
Perhaps others, those who remain.

808
01:44:35,595 --> 01:44:40,360
Did I just look... or did I
really see the archbishop?

809
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,305
I don't even know...

810
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:04,520
- Hello.
- Good day, sweetheart.

811
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:10,425
- Today is my birthday. What do you want me to do?
- What can I wish for you?

812
01:45:11,035 --> 01:45:12,330
Stay here next to me.

813
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,615
- You dirty the dress.
- I will never have to.

814
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,780
Come...

815
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:33,270
Kiss Me...

816
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:49,875
---------

817
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,750
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

818
01:46:31,365 --> 01:46:35,185
- We can do it differently.
- Let's go.

819
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:38,325
Anyway, soon death will begin.

820
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:46,205
Let's go to the river...

821
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:50,135
We'll need water.

822
01:47:12,265 --> 01:47:16,755
- I put it in a piece of paper.
- I... in a hurry.

823
01:47:20,495 --> 01:47:24,855
- We say goodbye first.
- We'll have plenty of time.

824
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,975
- Who starts?
- I can start it.

825
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:35,350
No, leave me.
I'm the man... yet...

826
01:47:35,925 --> 01:47:36,720
Good.

827
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:40,825
- I want to give it to you.
- I'd prefer to take it myself.

828
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:45,205
If it's a sin I want to
be responsible for it.

829
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,350
You have to get it out
of my hand, my husband.

830
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,615
First Brakes...

831
01:48:35,595 --> 01:48:37,510
Did you know I like it?

832
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:41,400
I thought it better
to bring them myself.

833
01:48:58,300 --> 01:48:59,330
Let's go to shore.

834
01:49:01,755 --> 01:49:03,785
Let's leave the river without sin.

835
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:09,935
Farewell...

836
01:49:11,005 --> 01:49:12,275
I think now...

837
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:14,805
Goodbye, my lover.

838
01:49:16,575 --> 01:49:20,710
Thanks for everything.
Thanks for death.

839
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:23,655
And I thank you.

840
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:28,270
You know how I love you...
How I loved you...

841
01:49:29,175 --> 01:49:32,690
- With all.
- For all.

842
01:49:34,615 --> 01:49:38,605
- Can you hear me?
- Very far.

843
01:49:41,185 --> 01:49:43,405
Soon we will know everything.

844
01:49:44,485 --> 01:49:48,580
- If there's anything to know.
- It doesn't matter any more.

845
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:54,065
- Sleep, lover...
- You sleep in peace, sweetheart...

846
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:04,700
<i>There is no world of my childhood.</i>

847
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:09,400
<i>She lives only in
me and with me.</i>

848
01:52:10,165 --> 01:52:13,935
<i>It will turn into ash and disappear
somewhere in nothingness.
