00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:19,582
<i>Eggs for sale! Eggs!</i>

2
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:20,624
Stack these up there.

3
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,377
Thank you, have a good day!

4
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:24,795
Two boxes, please.

5
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:26,505
Sure. Two boxes.

6
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:30,927
Two boxes… That'll be $8.

7
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:34,138
Here's $2 in change.

8
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,431
Give me another $1.

9
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:38,101
Listen to you!

10
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:03,334
<i>Voice of Silence</i>

11
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:34,573
<i>Today's honest sweat is
tomorrow's happiness</i>

12
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,983
You wore this as a kid.

13
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:13,529
When I grabbed my stuff, I
realized that mine was torn.

14
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,158
So I took this instead.
It actually fits.

15
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,632
Pull!

16
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:37,386
A bit more, just a bit.

17
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,680
Keep going.

18
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,725
More… Okay stop! That's good.

19
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:02,411
Okay, stop.

20
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,876
What?

21
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,796
What's going on?

22
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:19,012
My arms are numb!

23
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,513
What's that water dipper for?

24
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:23,266
What are you going to do?

25
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,227
You little pricks.

26
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:28,812
You know who I am?

27
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:33,067
Who do you think you are?

28
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,321
Answer me! Can't you talk?

29
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:42,785
Don't just stare. One word
from me and you'll be…

30
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:46,747
I mean… a word from me
won't change anything.

31
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,292
The manager arrived, he's waiting.

32
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:54,130
The manager? Why? Why'd
he come all the way here?

33
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,340
Hey, hurry up.

34
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:58,426
What could it be?

35
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:07,351
You should've told me.
What brings him here?

36
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,188
Welcome, sir. Long time no see.

37
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:14,150
Yes, I came for a visit.

38
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,159
Let's talk afterwards.

39
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:26,704
Yes, see to your business
and I'll come soon.

40
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:28,456
So hot!

41
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:39,175
Wipe the hangers off before
hanging these up, okay?

42
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:41,010
Here.

43
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,611
Hey, time to start.

44
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,989
Lift his head.

45
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:27,556
Hey, what are you doing?
Come out quick!

46
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,145
We'll be outside, so tell
us when you're done.

47
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:32,770
Sure.

48
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,439
And if you need anything,
please let us know.

49
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,732
We'll be waiting.

50
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:38,401
Good work.

51
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:44,133
There you go again.

52
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:50,348
If they catch you doing
that, you're dead.

53
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,023
If you covet other people's
things, you'll fall into ruin.

54
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,693
Work hard to control yourself.

55
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:05,905
Time to delegate the truck
duties. You've saved enough.

56
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,325
Go yourself to pick up the eggs.

57
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:13,287
See how other people
work, take it all in.

58
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:16,207
Why do you get so distracted?

59
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,504
We should be thankful
for the work given us.

60
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:26,675
Take interest in the wrong
things, and there'll be trouble.

61
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:36,769
So, did you finish?

62
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,187
Yes, come on in.

63
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:41,690
We finished earlier, but
I had to make a call.

64
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:44,360
I have one for each of you.

65
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:55,788
You hung him a bit low.
Now my back is sore.

66
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,165
My apologies.

67
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:57,999
Hey, Doo-man.

68
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:58,374
Yes, boss.

69
00:08:58,457 --> 00:08:59,000
Photos.

70
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:04,005
If he'd talked sooner he'd have gone
more peacefully, without this mess!

71
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,091
- Let's talk!
- Yes, sir.

72
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:12,638
This time I'd like you to
hold someone for a few days.

73
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:14,390
That's a bit difficult for us...

74
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:17,393
After all, we usually
just handle the bodies.

75
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:26,069
I'm just asking you to
look after someone, okay?

76
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:30,156
I always work with you,
so do me this favor.

77
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:33,492
I'll pay you in cash tomorrow.

78
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:38,747
But actually from our perspective,
the issue isn't money...

79
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,713
I can't pay any more. Things
are hard for me, too.

80
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,594
It's really not the money, but
we don't do this kind of work.

81
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,512
Hey! My god…

82
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:58,809
You, come here.

83
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:01,479
Get over here!

84
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:08,111
What's your name?

85
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:13,407
This guy, he's a great
kid, but he hardly speaks.

86
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:15,784
His throat is a bit…

87
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,536
Just think of him as mute.

88
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:19,163
Oh, really?

89
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:24,418
As for your request,
we'll do the best we can.

90
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:29,090
Right, it won't be hard.
They'll send you the address.

91
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:30,049
Very well, sir.

92
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,594
Hey.

93
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:38,682
Hey!

94
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,775
You did a nice job.

95
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,407
You. Did. A. Nice. Job!

96
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:58,286
Good. Work. Today!

97
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,498
It was nothing, really.

98
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:06,002
- You guys clean up, then.
- Yes, have a good day!

99
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:09,672
Thanks as always!

100
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,685
What's with this weather?

101
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,612
Hey, wait a minute! Wait!

102
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,661
We put him in wrong. North is this way.

103
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:43,664
His head should point north.

104
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,544
Wow, I'm sorry.

105
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:52,298
My apologies!

106
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:58,137
With the mercy of Christ,

107
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,725
go peacefully on your path.

108
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:08,772
You've paid for your
earthly sins, rest in peace.

109
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:17,615
We are all sinners.
All of us, right? Amen.

110
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:24,288
Now shovel.

111
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:29,127
Are you listening to that
prayer tape I bought you?

112
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,672
If you listen well and pray
hard, you'll be able to speak.

113
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:37,760
I got that tape for you,
so be sure to listen.

114
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,178
Okay?

115
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,721
Keep shoveling.

116
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,210
We're here. Wake up.

117
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:14,380
Take this.

118
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,141
Stash it away well.

119
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,646
How long will that old woman live?

120
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:40,073
Take out 5 eggs and give them to her.

121
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,214
And listen to the tape before bed!

122
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,350
Thank you!

123
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:02,863
That's not it!

124
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,158
<i>Didn't you say on the
right after the gas station?</i>

125
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:08,744
A 3-story building, on Route 24.

126
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:10,538
<i>- Route 24?</i>
- Yes.

127
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:12,957
<i>- I don't think it's Route 24.</i>
- What?

128
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,458
<i>I see a 3-story building.</i>

129
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,460
It must be right, then.

130
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,754
<i>Is it 4 stories? Damn.</i>

131
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,506
- Just a minute.
<i>- Yes.</i>

132
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,717
You see a 3-story building?

133
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:26,179
Yes.

134
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:32,018
Drive past the building
about 300 or 400 meters,

135
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,812
and you'll see a dirt
road on the right.

136
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:38,857
No, a dirt road. Dirt!

137
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,486
Dirt, not asphalt.

138
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:48,367
Just come down that road.

139
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:55,624
You can park the truck
here. Drive safe.

140
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:01,089
Hello? Yes.

141
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:03,799
The person is in the room,
but we need to leave in 10 min.

142
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:09,847
We'll leave the key under
a flower pot by the door.

143
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:11,140
Thank you!

144
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:27,031
The manager said to keep
him just one or two days,

145
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:29,242
so let's be on our toes.

146
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,078
This must be right?

147
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:36,415
For now, bring that. We
need to keep him scared.

148
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:51,764
Not that, the bat! The bat!

149
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:01,232
Why bring the shovel?

150
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:26,049
Is it the wrong room?

151
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,551
It's B-102, right?

152
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,304
What's going on?

153
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:35,975
Is it the next room?

154
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:47,111
What? What is it?

155
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,281
What the hell?

156
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:04,963
It's a kid? The one we're
supposed to keep?

157
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:10,093
Who does the manager think I am?

158
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:12,095
Hey, Rabbit!

159
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:16,807
No way, if I'd known this
there's no way I'd agree.

160
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:19,685
I'll call him. Wait here.

161
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:23,772
Hello, Manager?

162
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:27,610
We arrived right on
time for the pickup.

163
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:34,325
But it turns out… it's a kid?

164
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:37,078
A little girl.

165
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:38,787
What?

166
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:51,425
It turns out she's
being held for ransom,

167
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:54,470
but her dad keeps
haggling on the price.

168
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,556
They meant to take her brother,

169
00:18:57,598 --> 00:19:00,601
a 3rd-generation only son, but
these idiots took her instead.

170
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,854
The manager must be upset, too.

171
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,565
Maybe he wants to pay
less because it's a girl?

172
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:11,820
Sons and daughters should
be treated the same.

173
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:13,697
What kind of parents are they?

174
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:16,993
Anyway,

175
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:20,496
you know what my home is like,
with so many people around.

176
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:25,084
So just for a day,
keep her at your home.

177
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,298
I know, I know…

178
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:36,429
But I took you in as a baby, raised
you, give you suitable work.

179
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:40,141
And for this job we need
someone who won't talk.

180
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:43,436
If you think about it, you
can do her a kind service!

181
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,068
Look, if I bring her home,

182
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:53,029
you think she'll just keep quiet?

183
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:54,989
What a fuss she'll make!

184
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,241
Then what happens? The cops will come.

185
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:58,993
And with my bad leg, they'll catch me.

186
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:03,915
And with no work, you'll be sucking
your thumb at home, right?

187
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,420
Just one day.

188
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,423
Let's go. Get in.

189
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:28,982
Mister.

190
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,568
Am I going to die?

191
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:37,573
No, we're just going somewhere.

192
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:40,784
We're friends of your dad's.

193
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:46,415
But he'll come later, so
you'll stay with us, Ju-hee.

194
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:51,087
My name is Cho-hee.

195
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,756
Oh right, Cho-hee.
What's your full name?

196
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,299
Bae Cho-hee.

197
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,093
Wow, that's a pretty name.

198
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,429
Your dad has to give us
something, so he went to get it.

199
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,266
He'll come soon so don't worry.

200
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,936
You'll be home soon, Cho-hee.

201
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:10,189
Will he pay the money?

202
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,485
It's not about money…

203
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,364
Then when will he come?

204
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:20,491
He'll come tomorrow.

205
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:24,370
Tonight you'll sleep
at this guy's place,

206
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:27,957
and in a day your dad
will come, okay Cho-hee?

207
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,084
Okay.

208
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:36,882
I'll wake you later. Get some sleep.

209
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:40,178
Thank you.

210
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:51,772
Every time he rides in the truck...

211
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:57,361
Cho-hee, say, we're here!

212
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,124
He says we're here.

213
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,755
Here, buy something yummy
for you and the girl.

214
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:22,678
It's $30. Don't lose it.

215
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,432
We'll get paid well after
this job is finished, okay?

216
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:32,897
Cho-hee. Lots of scary
guys around here,

217
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,566
so stick close to that guy, okay?

218
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:37,026
Okay.

219
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:24,782
Oh, Granny!

220
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:26,159
Granny!

221
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,785
Please save me!

222
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:29,162
What's with you?

223
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:34,875
Listen to your brother. Go on.

224
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:39,380
Be nice to your sister.

225
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:00,586
I'm hungry!

226
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:04,798
I'm hungry!

227
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:16,996
Where are you from?

228
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,919
What's your name?

229
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,088
Kim Moon-joo.

230
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:30,843
Is there a telephone here?

231
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:39,894
When my dad arrives, come with us.

232
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,730
I'll take you away.

233
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,149
And my brother?

234
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:46,775
Your brother?

235
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,739
He's your brother?

236
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:48,106
Moon-joo... Moon-joo.

237
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:59,825
I'm hungry.

238
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,456
Did you sleep well?

239
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:11,379
Moon-joo, is he really your brother?

240
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:16,592
You're nice, right?

241
00:29:19,512 --> 00:29:21,347
Is your brother nice?

242
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,060
I'm hungry!

243
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:49,583
<i>Lock up the girl and come
for cleaning. 11 AM.</i>

244
00:29:55,965 --> 00:30:00,803
<i>Can't lock the door
because of my sister.</i>

245
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,707
Manager?

246
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:32,668
Manager?

247
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:40,176
This may be a bad time,
but about that girl…

248
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:43,346
Who will take over that job?

249
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:46,682
What?

250
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:50,228
What?

251
00:30:50,686 --> 00:30:52,646
Can't believe this...

252
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:57,485
Why'd he make us take that girl?

253
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:16,629
Could you tell me who oversees
the situation with the girl...?

254
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:20,049
At the manager's order,
we took the girl yesterday.

255
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:23,052
Then, she's not your daughter?

256
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:25,221
I'm a bachelor.

257
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:29,558
I haven't heard about
that. Did any of you?

258
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:35,899
That manager was involved
in all kinds of schemes.

259
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:40,653
It's a real mess. I'll
make some calls later.

260
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:42,780
I'd really appreciate that.

261
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:44,823
You can go in now. It's all ready.

262
00:31:44,865 --> 00:31:46,325
Bye.

263
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:48,452
Hello?

264
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:52,373
Yes, I'm the man who called
yesterday and picked up the girl.

265
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:55,334
Yes, Manager Kim who
contacted you about this...

266
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:02,591
had something come up...

267
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:05,594
He's being killed right now.

268
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,098
I think he needed money
and arranged this deal alone.

269
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:11,517
Yes, let's meet and discuss this.

270
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:16,564
You should've explained
things first before dying.

271
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:19,650
Finish what you started.

272
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:29,994
After rising to manager,
it all ends like this.

273
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:34,248
Whatever you do, do
your best and be humble.

274
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:38,169
Always be thankful for what you have.

275
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,842
God, it's hot.

276
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:50,723
With this hot weather,
the stench is awful.

277
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,071
Mister!

278
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,405
What?

279
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:10,326
Will we meet my dad today?

280
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,788
Your dad said he can't come today.

281
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:16,790
But don't worry.

282
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,918
Then will he come tomorrow?

283
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,256
I don't think so. The
day after tomorrow!

284
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:53,369
Once you join a family,
you have to pitch in, right?

285
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,889
They're here.

286
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:13,514
Oh my.

287
00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:14,974
How do you do?

288
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,017
Hello!

289
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:19,062
I'm Kang Chang-bok, who called before.

290
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:20,438
You're early.

291
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:23,566
Last time I was a bit late,
so I hurried this time.

292
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,444
It's always a mess after a kid leaves.

293
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:29,948
Have a seat.

294
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,204
You seem to specialize
in this line of work.

295
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:38,372
Yes, it's true.

296
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:40,249
I can see you do well for yourselves.

297
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,376
I wouldn't say that.

298
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:45,129
But we're always busy.

299
00:34:57,683 --> 00:35:02,897
This being your job, you must
understand the children's...

300
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:12,907
Before things get too complicated,
we'd like to wrap up this situation.

301
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,825
Wrap it up as you wish.

302
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:16,827
Our basic fee is $25,000.

303
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:20,081
And we'll bill you for any
additional expenses.

304
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:25,086
No, you see, it's not us paying you.

305
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:29,340
And you said your fee is $25,000?

306
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:32,593
The manager told us
we'd receive $3,000.

307
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:39,683
What I'm suggesting is, when
you receive her ransom,

308
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:41,644
we'll get our share,

309
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:46,357
and you can take more than
you were originally promised.

310
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:51,320
Yes, but this kind of
job is not so simple.

311
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:54,323
So we're saying, you take the child,

312
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:57,994
and then you can keep
the entire ransom.

313
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:01,915
If you want us to take the
child, then you can pay us.

314
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:04,750
We're giving you the kid,
why should we pay you?

315
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:09,255
Aren't you asking us to resolve
your difficult situation?

316
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:16,637
Then you'd collect the ransom
directly from the parents?

317
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:21,850
This being the busy season, we
might go for the quicker option.

318
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,811
The quicker option?

319
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:27,565
Selling her is faster than
waiting for the parents.

320
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:35,614
Then sir, we'll help you arrange
to collect the ransom,

321
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,867
and we'll each add a bit to our fee.

322
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:43,414
She seems like a nice kid.
How great to return her home?

323
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:48,336
You just need to write a few letters.

324
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:52,215
Your required supplies.

325
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:56,260
It's not much.

326
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:59,931
You can buy it all at a
kids' stationery store.

327
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:08,564
<i>Supplies and Precautions</i>

328
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:17,365
Get a sketch book, and pick one.

329
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:18,824
This one.

330
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:20,243
You want this one?

331
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,296
- That's $7.
- Okay.

332
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,888
<i>Dad, prepare $200,000 in cash.
Under Baekhap Bridge, June 26</i>

333
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,722
What are you writing?

334
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:49,605
I'm asking my dad to prepare 200 grand.

335
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:51,857
What's 200 grand?

336
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:55,028
It's a lot of money.

337
00:37:57,196 --> 00:37:58,572
Why?

338
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:02,535
The kidnappers said they need money.

339
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:04,745
What's a kid-nipper?

340
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,623
The people who took me.

341
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:10,126
My brother?

342
00:38:24,057 --> 00:38:27,351
Don't draw on the floor. Use paper.

343
00:38:27,726 --> 00:38:30,104
Or your brother will get mad.

344
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:36,485
Let's draw here instead.

345
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:50,374
Here he is.

346
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,127
Thanks for coming so far.

347
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:55,922
The letter?

348
00:38:58,632 --> 00:38:59,926
Here you go.

349
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:01,177
Pretty envelope.

350
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,555
Did you take care of everything?

351
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:07,183
Yes, he did.

352
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:08,476
Nice work.

353
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:13,439
For sure, someone will be
watching over the first location.

354
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:14,983
Oh, really?

355
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:17,443
So we should write a second letter.

356
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,280
I'll text you the time
and place like last time.

357
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,325
Very well. Have a good night.

358
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:26,285
Let's go.

359
00:39:27,203 --> 00:39:29,663
Oh! Just a sec.

360
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:32,291
When you sealed the envelope…

361
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:36,087
...did you do this?

362
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:39,173
Did you lick it?

363
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,513
He licked it, what do we do?

364
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:50,268
I'll put this one into a new envelope,

365
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,395
but next time,

366
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:57,025
no saliva, sweat, or strands of hair.

367
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,485
You have to be sure
there's none of that.

368
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:00,361
I understand.

369
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:01,237
Remember that.

370
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:54,290
Moon-joo, let's eat that
when your brother comes in.

371
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,126
Should we put it on the table?

372
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:03,049
I'll open it for you.

373
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,885
Moon-joo, you're nice
so you can wait, right?

374
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:12,558
Since you listen well,
I'll give you a prize.

375
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,980
Should I teach you how to fold clothes?

376
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:20,441
Watch.

377
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:30,451
Fold this in half,
then smooth this out,

378
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:33,162
then fold just a little.

379
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:34,622
Yes, like that.

380
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:36,415
You're good at it.

381
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:37,101
After your brother starts eating.

382
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:40,939
Hurry up!

383
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,691
Hurry up!

384
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:46,903
What did I tell you?

385
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:51,282
Please hurry up.

386
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,626
Hurry!

387
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:16,140
I'll cut it for you.

388
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,205
Taste good?

389
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:52,611
Can I go to the bathroom?

390
00:45:04,457 --> 00:45:07,210
Will you come with me?

391
00:45:30,774 --> 00:45:32,568
Don't go anywhere.

392
00:45:44,038 --> 00:45:45,915
Are you still there?

393
00:45:49,252 --> 00:45:50,794
Still there?

394
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:28,041
So my dad won't come
for the next 4 days?

395
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,796
He'll come after the letter arrives?

396
00:46:57,528 --> 00:46:59,197
Hi Granny!

397
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:27,141
Stop it!

398
00:48:24,282 --> 00:48:26,409
Nice to have clean hair?

399
00:48:27,326 --> 00:48:30,663
Hey, Moon-joo!

400
00:48:31,414 --> 00:48:33,124
We need to rinse it!

401
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:37,420
Caught you!

402
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:52,476
Hey, don't push.

403
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,649
Here we are.

404
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:08,159
One, two, three!

405
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:09,160
Okay.

406
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:29,847
Uncle!

407
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:35,686
Good girl.

408
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:37,146
Let's sit down.

409
00:49:48,074 --> 00:49:50,451
Did those jerks sell us a dud?

410
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,664
Oh, it works.

411
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:57,375
What?

412
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,210
Maybe not.

413
00:50:00,461 --> 00:50:02,964
It's always black at first.

414
00:50:03,464 --> 00:50:06,717
We have one at home. Can I try it?

415
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:15,726
Look this way!

416
00:50:17,145 --> 00:50:18,854
She says to look.

417
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:21,149
One, two, three!

418
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:25,778
Wow, it works!

419
00:50:26,445 --> 00:50:30,074
Soon you'll see the photo.
But right now it's black.

420
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:31,993
What is this?

421
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:37,123
You need to shake it. Blow on it.

422
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,543
Cho-hee, look!

423
00:50:40,876 --> 00:50:42,211
Hey!

424
00:50:42,628 --> 00:50:47,300
If you grin like that, your parents
will tell you to just live here.

425
00:50:47,383 --> 00:50:50,094
You need to look sad, okay?

426
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:51,595
As sad as possible!

427
00:50:51,637 --> 00:50:53,764
Oh, I'm sad!

428
00:50:54,348 --> 00:50:58,269
<i>To Mom and Dad</i>

429
00:51:02,731 --> 00:51:04,567
Pass the glue.

430
00:51:11,324 --> 00:51:13,659
Finish this up. Put the gloves on.

431
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:16,745
Yes, sir?

432
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,166
We just finished the letter,
and are about to deliver it.

433
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:23,002
What?

434
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:25,671
Draw an umbrella, please!

435
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:28,757
Draw it! Draw it!

436
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:33,179
Draw it!

437
00:51:49,362 --> 00:51:52,198
Wow, he draws well.

438
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:56,369
Where's your mom?

439
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:57,870
Daejeon.

440
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:00,831
Is that as far as America?

441
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,166
No.

442
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:04,502
Then why don't you go see her?

443
00:52:05,628 --> 00:52:06,462
Well...

444
00:52:07,213 --> 00:52:10,133
Dad doesn't want me to come home.

445
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:11,550
Why?

446
00:52:12,468 --> 00:52:15,263
He thinks my younger brother is enough.

447
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,478
Sit down here.

448
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:29,110
Those sons of bitches, they
want me to collect the ransom.

449
00:52:30,236 --> 00:52:33,990
They say they might've been
recognized when they took the girl.

450
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:38,119
Do they think the cops will only
arrest people they recognize?

451
00:52:38,536 --> 00:52:40,079
What a bunch of crooks.

452
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:43,332
Then what'll they do
if the letter arrives late?

453
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,127
Did you glue this properly?

454
00:52:48,587 --> 00:52:50,798
I have no connection with them,

455
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:54,510
so they say it's safest
if I collect the money.

456
00:52:56,345 --> 00:52:58,181
It's true, actually.

457
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:08,399
You see? I've been skipping
church, that's why this happened.

458
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:14,948
If the dad says he'll
pay but doesn't show up,

459
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:18,492
you'll have to take the girl here.

460
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:19,827
It's a chicken farm.

461
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:22,997
It's not too far, 30-40
minutes by bike?

462
00:53:23,957 --> 00:53:26,000
I'll have to go far for the money,

463
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:28,461
so if you drop off the
girl, they'll take care of it.

464
00:53:29,503 --> 00:53:30,421
Don't worry!

465
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:39,763
So if I get the money before
noon tomorrow I'll call you,

466
00:53:40,098 --> 00:53:43,893
but if I don't call, be
sure to drop off the girl.

467
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:46,687
What time? Noon!

468
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:50,191
Just follow the plan. And
listen to the prayer tape!

469
00:54:11,129 --> 00:54:14,757
<i>A child who is obedient
shall be free of disease.</i>

470
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:18,552
<i>A child who believes shall have
blood vessels free of plaque.</i>

471
00:54:19,178 --> 00:54:22,348
<i>A mute child who obeys
shall be able to speak.</i>

472
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:26,560
<i>A child touched by The
One shall grow strong.</i>

473
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:29,563
<i>A child who believes shall drive
out the curses of the ancestors.</i>

474
00:54:29,605 --> 00:54:32,441
<i>One who obeys shall be free of fear.</i>

475
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:35,736
Yes, it's me.

476
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,698
I don't see anyone with a blue cap.

477
00:54:41,075 --> 00:54:47,331
I'm at the right place, at the
arcade. By the livestock center.

478
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,459
Yes.

479
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:57,091
By any chance... The blue
cap! No, it's an old man.

480
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:59,718
Did they back out? 15
minutes have passed.

481
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:06,642
All right, I'll wait
a bit longer, then.

482
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:08,519
Yes, I understand.

483
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,397
I'm going crazy here!

484
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,844
Hello.

485
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,785
12 sheets by 4 PM would be difficult.

486
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,997
6 PM?

487
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:34,832
All right, then.

488
00:57:48,137 --> 00:57:49,763
Excuse me.

489
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:51,140
Excuse me!

490
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:57,063
Shit! Damn it!

491
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:51,993
Slowly... don't spill.

492
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:30,281
<i>Dream Travel Agency:
Taking you to the skies</i>

493
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:49,217
Did my dad get the letter?

494
01:00:07,902 --> 01:00:11,948
I'll go to work with your
brother. Let's finish later.

495
01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:44,207
We do charge differently
by age. But not by gender.

496
01:01:44,248 --> 01:01:48,419
And type O is a bit more
expensive, but not much.

497
01:01:48,962 --> 01:01:52,715
That's what we did last time.

498
01:01:55,801 --> 01:01:58,972
We've got a long waiting list.

499
01:01:59,263 --> 01:02:01,640
If the price is too
high, then forget it.

500
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:09,607
Yes, that's good for us, too.

501
01:02:10,524 --> 01:02:12,026
When should we meet?

502
01:02:12,902 --> 01:02:18,032
Sure, see you in a bit.

503
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:21,410
Oh, hi! So you found it okay?

504
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:27,708
Come on out! It's the
girl they called about.

505
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,584
She's here?

506
01:02:29,252 --> 01:02:30,586
It's okay, look here.

507
01:02:36,425 --> 01:02:37,676
What?

508
01:02:38,386 --> 01:02:40,221
She's not 7 years old.

509
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:43,391
I checked it with Mr. Choi three times!

510
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:47,145
I can't believe that jerk!

511
01:02:48,854 --> 01:02:51,274
Hey, how old are you?

512
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:53,317
I'm 11.

513
01:02:53,526 --> 01:02:54,443
Your blood type?

514
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:55,945
B.

515
01:02:58,697 --> 01:03:00,824
What'll you do now?

516
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:02,160
Sit down.

517
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:04,495
I'll call Choi now.

518
01:03:04,954 --> 01:03:06,372
I'm not sure how the error occurred.

519
01:03:06,414 --> 01:03:11,294
The girl just arrived,
but she's 11, not 7.

520
01:03:11,835 --> 01:03:13,587
She just arrived now.

521
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:18,968
If that's so, then the
price you mentioned...

522
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:23,181
5% for each year. Right.

523
01:03:23,222 --> 01:03:28,352
So 4 years times 5% means 20% less.

524
01:03:28,477 --> 01:03:31,439
Then I'll call you later
when the delivery is done.

525
01:03:31,814 --> 01:03:35,151
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

526
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:38,696
What are you sorry about?

527
01:03:39,697 --> 01:03:41,908
Yes, I'll call later.

528
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:46,870
Have this before you go.

529
01:03:49,332 --> 01:03:51,792
Take it! My arm hurts.

530
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:02,428
You can go now.

531
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:09,227
What? Need a receipt?

532
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,482
Then go on. It's so hot today.

533
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:20,654
You sit down here. Drink this.

534
01:04:21,364 --> 01:04:22,615
Hurry and go.

535
01:04:23,782 --> 01:04:28,162
He needs to go somewhere. Drink this.

536
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:29,788
What about my dad?

537
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:34,627
He can't come?

538
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:40,633
Your dad asked us to
take you someplace nice.

539
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:44,678
Drink this. Ignore the
taste, just swallow it.

540
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,472
The aftertaste is sweet.

541
01:04:47,056 --> 01:04:47,974
Drink.

542
01:04:50,434 --> 01:04:51,269
Is it bitter?

543
01:04:51,895 --> 01:04:56,815
Ignore the taste, just
down the whole glass.

544
01:04:57,608 --> 01:04:58,484
That's right.

545
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,237
She's a pro!

546
01:05:01,612 --> 01:05:02,696
I told you it's good.

547
01:05:04,657 --> 01:05:05,783
Want another?

548
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:10,121
Stop fooling around.
It'll come back up soon.

549
01:05:11,164 --> 01:05:12,290
Sure.

550
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,208
All done now.

551
01:05:20,756 --> 01:05:22,216
Where's Cho-hee?

552
01:05:23,676 --> 01:05:25,011
Where's Cho-hee?

553
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:20,316
♪ This passion in my heart, ♪
♪ my head carried high... ♪

554
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:24,195
♪ Don't blame me for this promised... ♪

555
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,292
Oh my god!

556
01:06:42,964 --> 01:06:44,215
Hey, you!

557
01:06:44,257 --> 01:06:45,633
Get away!

558
01:06:45,674 --> 01:06:47,176
Let go of that!

559
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,971
What's he doing back here?

560
01:06:57,353 --> 01:06:59,855
Hey bum, you'll die like that!

561
01:06:59,898 --> 01:07:01,232
Hey!

562
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:05,945
Let go!

563
01:07:22,503 --> 01:07:25,339
Get over here!

564
01:07:25,381 --> 01:07:26,382
Damn you!

565
01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:30,469
You little prick!

566
01:07:31,095 --> 01:07:31,637
Stop!

567
01:07:41,397 --> 01:07:42,606
All right, all right.

568
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:03,294
You bastard!

569
01:08:04,128 --> 01:08:06,547
My leg's busted, you bastard!

570
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:56,347
Hey, stop!

571
01:08:56,389 --> 01:08:57,681
You numbskull!

572
01:08:57,723 --> 01:09:00,476
Where are you going?

573
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:51,903
What idiot parked his
car in front of my store?

574
01:10:54,548 --> 01:10:58,677
I behaved well while you were gone.

575
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:01,264
Good girl.

576
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:03,182
Cho-hee.

577
01:11:07,603 --> 01:11:10,648
Can we play marbles?

578
01:11:14,277 --> 01:11:16,905
You need 5 stones.

579
01:11:18,447 --> 01:11:20,992
I'll go find one.

580
01:11:21,825 --> 01:11:24,620
The door's locked. Just wait.

581
01:11:25,204 --> 01:11:28,541
What? It's open.

582
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:51,355
Cho-hee!

583
01:11:55,276 --> 01:11:56,110
Look at this.

584
01:11:56,402 --> 01:11:58,446
Have you played hide-and-seek?

585
01:11:59,197 --> 01:11:59,780
No.

586
01:12:00,073 --> 01:12:01,865
I think you'll be good at it.

587
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:13,086
10

588
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:15,088
9

589
01:12:16,172 --> 01:12:17,715
8

590
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:20,676
7

591
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,304
6

592
01:12:24,055 --> 01:12:26,015
5

593
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:28,517
4

594
01:12:29,185 --> 01:12:30,811
3

595
01:12:31,687 --> 01:12:33,231

596
01:12:34,023 --> 01:12:35,608
1

597
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:36,901
Time's up!

598
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,242
Brother!

599
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:51,457
I played hide-and-seek with Cho-hee,
but she hid so well I can't find her.

600
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:54,728
Mister!

601
01:13:57,731 --> 01:13:58,816
Mister!

602
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,901
What the hell?

603
01:13:59,943 --> 01:14:01,527
Mister!

604
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:05,531
You scared the piss out of me!

605
01:14:05,781 --> 01:14:07,325
How could you jump out like that?

606
01:14:07,825 --> 01:14:08,826
I'm sorry.

607
01:14:09,285 --> 01:14:12,413
I need to go home, please help me.

608
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:14,040
You need to go home?

609
01:14:14,832 --> 01:14:15,666
Where is it?

610
01:14:17,835 --> 01:14:19,503
I'll take you there.

611
01:14:19,878 --> 01:14:21,965
Where's the police station?

612
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:23,967
The police?

613
01:14:28,721 --> 01:14:31,390
I'm a policeman.

614
01:14:32,016 --> 01:14:34,143
Come home with me.

615
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,395
A policeman...

616
01:14:38,397 --> 01:14:43,152
Come home with me, let's go.

617
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:45,071
Let's go home.

618
01:14:45,154 --> 01:14:46,572
What is it?

619
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:50,118
You said you wanted to go home!

620
01:14:53,162 --> 01:14:55,206
Hey!

621
01:14:55,248 --> 01:14:56,249
Kid!

622
01:18:18,117 --> 01:18:19,535
Officer Choi.

623
01:18:20,411 --> 01:18:22,746
How much did you drink
to be sleeping in the road?

624
01:18:22,788 --> 01:18:25,333
Not that much. Why pick on me?

625
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:28,169
Stand up.

626
01:18:33,925 --> 01:18:35,301
Han-sol, it's you?

627
01:18:36,302 --> 01:18:38,221
Did you really see a girl?

628
01:18:38,262 --> 01:18:41,724
Yeah, it was right here, but...

629
01:18:42,308 --> 01:18:44,268
she ran that way.

630
01:18:46,187 --> 01:18:47,605
How old was she?

631
01:18:47,981 --> 01:18:50,233
About 10, maybe.

632
01:18:50,984 --> 01:18:53,777
Her clothes? What
color was she wearing?

633
01:18:54,778 --> 01:18:55,905
Clothes...

634
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:58,324
She's a girl, so must've been pink.

635
01:18:59,658 --> 01:19:02,161
Pink... all right.

636
01:19:02,495 --> 01:19:04,872
I'll go take a look.

637
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:09,043
You go in and look through
missing child reports.

638
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,091
Han-sol?

639
01:19:18,802 --> 01:19:19,595
Good work.

640
01:19:30,356 --> 01:19:31,900
Is Moon-joo sleeping?

641
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:36,237
I'll go to the bathroom.

642
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:55,173
You're the bicycle guy, right?

643
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:58,301
What are you doing in
the dark? Exercising?

644
01:20:01,387 --> 01:20:02,846
Let me ask you.

645
01:20:03,347 --> 01:20:06,350
I heard a girl was wandering
around here lost.

646
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:08,937
You haven't seen her?

647
01:20:09,645 --> 01:20:14,150
Yes, they say clapping
is good for circulation.

648
01:20:14,692 --> 01:20:15,568
Is she here?

649
01:20:15,693 --> 01:20:17,361
Yes, I'm the policewoman.

650
01:20:18,321 --> 01:20:20,198
So you're his sister.

651
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,079
Is someone in there?

652
01:20:30,499 --> 01:20:31,667
Is someone inside?

653
01:20:58,027 --> 01:21:00,488
Get here, you!

654
01:21:03,116 --> 01:21:04,658
Look at this.

655
01:21:04,783 --> 01:21:06,702
I found another stone.

656
01:21:07,536 --> 01:21:09,413
Hide-and-seek is no fun.

657
01:21:14,418 --> 01:21:15,711
I've got you!

658
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,726
Let's do it later.

659
01:21:30,768 --> 01:21:31,227
Why?

660
01:22:54,894 --> 01:22:55,686
Moon-joo.

661
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:58,689
You're a good girl, would you help me?

662
01:22:58,731 --> 01:22:59,732
Yeah.

663
01:23:00,316 --> 01:23:04,278
Look. You dig up some dirt.

664
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:06,280
Then you dump it here.

665
01:23:06,322 --> 01:23:07,031
Yeah.

666
01:24:37,788 --> 01:24:41,125
God, look at you. Get a grip.

667
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,462
Hello.

668
01:24:44,503 --> 01:24:46,380
You came early.

669
01:24:46,672 --> 01:24:47,465
Oh my.

670
01:24:47,881 --> 01:24:50,718
I heard about it, but it's
worse than I thought.

671
01:24:50,884 --> 01:24:53,346
It's nothing. Have a seat.

672
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:59,227
After the kids ran away, only
real chicks now... Beat it!

673
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:04,315
I keep getting pestered to do this.

674
01:25:05,608 --> 01:25:11,906
But that crazy fool actually jumped
though the window, as I drove.

675
01:25:11,948 --> 01:25:12,740
As you drove?

676
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:15,701
Yeah! He was punching me.

677
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:18,496
And I had to drive with this hand,

678
01:25:18,579 --> 01:25:22,875
so I was blocking all his
punches, and I cracked my arm.

679
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:26,462
Wow, your life is like a movie.

680
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:27,964
Nah.

681
01:25:29,048 --> 01:25:31,800
Now that I'm older,
my bones are brittle.

682
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:36,639
But did you go to the dead man's house?

683
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:38,724
Yeah, I stopped by.

684
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:41,477
But nobody knows much
about the other guy.

685
01:25:41,852 --> 01:25:44,647
He came on a bike, so it can't be far.

686
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:47,525
Isari Village is just 10 minutes away.

687
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:52,071
Not many houses there,
so it might be easy.

688
01:25:52,906 --> 01:25:54,198
I'm sure we'll find him.

689
01:26:11,174 --> 01:26:14,343
Granny, I'm looking
for a cousin of mine.

690
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:16,429
Wondering if he lives near here.

691
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:17,346
So what?

692
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:21,350
No, what I mean is...

693
01:26:21,392 --> 01:26:23,269
Can't hear what you're saying!

694
01:26:23,727 --> 01:26:29,775
I'm looking for my cousin,
but can't find him. A man.

695
01:26:30,193 --> 01:26:33,696
He always rides his bike around here.

696
01:26:33,737 --> 01:26:37,283
Bike? Then it's that way.

697
01:26:37,951 --> 01:26:40,411
That way?

698
01:26:40,453 --> 01:26:43,915
Do you know a man who
rides his bike around here?

699
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,292
That way? Thanks!

700
01:27:04,102 --> 01:27:06,645
<i>Seonin Elementary School
Grade 4, Bae Cho-hee</i>

701
01:29:05,014 --> 01:29:06,765
God, you're a shitty driver.

702
01:29:06,807 --> 01:29:09,978
Sorry about that.
Could that be the house?

703
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:27,495
Go on in.

704
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:34,043
Anyone?

705
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:47,223
Was she that small?

706
01:29:48,099 --> 01:29:50,894
Yeah, I think so. There's the rabbit.

707
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:53,229
Right.

708
01:29:56,565 --> 01:29:57,233
Hey.

709
01:29:58,651 --> 01:29:59,735
What are you watching?

710
01:30:04,032 --> 01:30:05,199
Your brother sent us to get you.

711
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:07,952
Is he with her?

712
01:30:08,912 --> 01:30:12,999
She's there too. Give her a candy.

713
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:16,585
He said to give you this.

714
01:30:18,254 --> 01:30:19,713
I'll open it.

715
01:30:20,506 --> 01:30:22,466
Put on your shoes. Let's go.

716
01:30:32,768 --> 01:30:34,228
Let's go.

717
01:30:36,105 --> 01:30:38,066
Not that way. Hey!

718
01:30:38,107 --> 01:30:40,944
Don't go there, you punk.

719
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:55,166
He's alive.

720
01:31:00,879 --> 01:31:02,423
What's going on? Dig!

721
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:03,967
All right.

722
01:31:05,676 --> 01:31:08,846
How could they bury someone alive?

723
01:31:08,972 --> 01:31:11,891
Really, that's going too far.

724
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:33,079
Get the girl.

725
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:55,351
What a pathetic.

726
01:31:55,518 --> 01:31:57,270
Just leave her behind!

727
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:05,361
Start the car.

728
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:26,257
See where it says Class 3?
Our classroom is below that.

729
01:32:35,266 --> 01:32:36,600
Teacher!

730
01:32:41,605 --> 01:32:43,316
Cho-hee!

731
01:33:01,417 --> 01:33:03,252
I was so worried...

732
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:14,638
But who's that man?

733
01:33:17,266 --> 01:33:19,268
Do you know him?

734
01:33:30,363 --> 01:33:31,364
Oh my god!

735
01:33:33,782 --> 01:33:34,951
The kidnapper!

736
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,038
Hey! Catch him!

737
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:43,001
Oh my god! The one in black! Catch him!

738
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,377
He's a kidnapper! Catch him!

739
01:33:58,474 --> 01:34:00,476
Cho-hee!

740
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:03,771
Cho-hee.

741
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:56,384
