1
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,400
DECEPTION

2
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,037
10:53 pm.

3
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,036
Sorry for scaring you.
I was just heading home.

4
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,596
We met before in the can.
- Oh, you're Wyatt, right?

5
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,593
Yeah. So, you working late or
you downloading a multitude of porn.

6
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,196
I have to be out of here by tomorrow
so I'm just trying to finish up.

7
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,874
What about you?
- You kidding? This is an early night.

8
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,996
Hard to believe once upon a time...

9
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,470
it was a measure of a man's success
on how little he worked.

10
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,869
What's the deal? Our firm hires you
to bless our books they send you?

11
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,157
I'm the audit manager, yeah. I handle
the same 7 or 8 clients every year.

12
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,198
I must've done Stern
for something like 4 years now.

13
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,193
Wow. So you like this work?
- I do. The order of it appeals to me.

14
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,200
The symmetry.

15
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,238
It's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with numbers.

16
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,231
Do you like being a lawyer?

17
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,710
It's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with assholes.

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,674
I'm probably disturbing you, so...
- Hey, no, it's alright. I'm almost done.

19
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,320
Really.
- Oh.

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,992
So...

21
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,832
Worth and Berman, huh?
Did they headhunt you?

22
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,669
Yeah. My senior year of college.
They subsidized my graduate degree.

23
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,752
Ah, I see.
So you were poor, right?

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,917
I guess I was kind of poor.
I was brought up by my mom on her own...

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,390
and she died when I was 19
so it was kind of like a lifeline.

26
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,717
Wow. Sounds like you needed it.
- I'm sure there's a lot of people

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,791
that had it worse.
- Not here.

28
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,952
Practically every suit I know
is Harvard by way of Andover.

29
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,871
Are you?
- Oh, hell no. No, no.

30
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,397
I'm Princeton by way of Exeter.
- But that's like the same. Oh yeah.

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,234
So, Jonathan...

32
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,230
I think I have something here
which might help you to focus.

33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,115
You smoke?
- Not for a long time.

34
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,272
Good. This'll give you a real buzz,
then.

35
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,195
I don't know...
I just sometimes feel so, uh...

36
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,832
you know... removed.

37
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,872
I work for one of the biggest
accounting firms in the world...

38
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,350
and there's not so much as a desk there
to prove it. My new senior manager...

39
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,874
I haven't even met him in person yet.

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,350
I try and meet people at work
but it's always the same.

41
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,992
To the accounting staff I'm a pain because
for 2 weeks they must hold their breath.

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,878
They hope I don't pick up
any of their screw-ups.

43
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,350
To everyone else I'm just a temporary fixed
so I bother them.

44
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,274
Sometimes...

45
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,194
I sit and I look through the glass,
and I see life..

46
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,832
Iiterally passing me by.
- Jonathan.

47
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,832
Yeah?

48
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,115
By the clock on that wall you have been
talking for 37 minutes straight.

49
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,512
I don't remember a word I said.

50
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,278
So, God says to Jesus...

51
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,310
I haven't felt this good
since I sawVan Halen in '97.

52
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,071
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

53
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,833
Is this the train to Canal Street?
- Yes, this is the right train.

54
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,190
So, I guess that's it.
This is my report for Mr. Cross.

55
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,271
Could you point me towards
Wyatt Bose's office, please?

56
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,396
Who?
- Wyatt Bose. He's one of your...

57
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,358
Hey, quit looking down Daphne's shirt.

58
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,510
So, get in, get out, huh? So where's next?

59
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,672
Clancey Funds on Friday
and then Clute-Nichols after that.

60
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,638
Sounds like fun.
Wait up a sec.

61
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,079
Good to meet you, Jonathan.
- You, too.

62
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,232
So... wait.
You have the day off tomorrow?.

63
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,472
How's your backhand?

64
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,193
I'm sorry.
- Good game.

65
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,872
Commiserations, McQuarry.

66
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,635
You develop a killer instinct,
you'll beat the crap out of me.

67
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,075
When these things first came out,
I think I was a frosh at boarding school.

68
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,833
Geez, where did you get this thing?
You steal it from Jimmy Connors?

69
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,310
What is this? Ntural gut, hm?
- No, natural gut and Kevlar.

70
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,072
I should have 'em replaced.
They're pretty frayed.

71
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,112
Those two girls were so pretty.

72
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,718
You don't get much, do you?

73
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,548
Do you mean sex?
- No, flood insurance.

74
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,234
How many women have you slept with?

75
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,198
Of course you know. Everyone knows.

76
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,158
Maybe four.
- Maybe four?

77
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,474
Alright. Four. What about you?

78
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,950
Me? I have no idea.
- You just said everyone knows.

79
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,516
I meant everyone like you.
C'mon, hurry up. Let's go for a drink.

80
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,552
You can borrow something of mine.
Ah. Guten Abend, Herr Kleiner.

81
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,553
This way, Jonathan.

82
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,277
Like it?

83
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,359
It's a Gerhard Richter. Actually,
Kleiner, the guy we just saw downstairs.

84
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,476
He's a hotshot art dealer.

85
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,313
He hooked me up with this
fantastic gallery in Munich.

86
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,391
I'll be back in a second.

87
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,354
Try this one.

88
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,669
What?

89
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,316
C'mon, Jonathan.

90
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,393
You remind me of this guy, Jamie Getz.
I met him my freshman year at Princeton.

91
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,395
Oh, he was real smart. He was witty, too,
when you loosened him up. But he had...

92
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,870
It was bounday. Nowyou assume
that it was never scaled out.

93
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,796
The truth is he was the only one guarding.

94
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,272
What happened to him?
- Oh, he killed himself.

95
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,509
What?

96
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,752
You're kidding.

97
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,356
Go get changed.
- Down here?

98
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,313
Down there.
Second door on the right.

99
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,390
Okay, Jonathan, so just the four, huh?

100
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,074
Oh, come on.
Now, look...

101
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,597
I've never been too adventuresome.

102
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,832
What's the lamest?
- Well, I once...

103
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,754
No, c'mon, share it with the group.
- I once phoned one of those sex lines.

104
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,957
Alright, nowwe're talking.
- I talked to girl named Star.

105
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,989
I ended up explaining a Section 179
deduction on the new Escalade.

106
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,795
You paid to give tax advice on a sex line?
- That's about the size of it.

107
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,630
Oh, thank you for sharing, Jonathan.
That is pretty lame.

108
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,678
Oh, hello.

109
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,356
Do you... is she looking at me?
- Yeah, she's looking at you.

110
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,512
No, she's not. C'mon.
- Maybe it's the suit?

111
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,272
Listen, you don't think
women have the same urges?

112
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,750
Successful women working their asses off
to stay that way?

113
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,875
And?

114
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,873
Well, let's just say there's a way
that it can be taken care of.

115
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,151
You make it sound like a mob hit.

116
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,353
Had a good time tonight?
- I had a really good time tonight.

117
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,353
I did. I had a great time.
- Whoa. I wasn't sure at one point.

118
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,635
No, I'm shy. But...

119
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,757
Thank you. And thanks for the tennis
and for takin' me out.

120
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,753
It's okay. Tennis anytime.
Particularly if you play that badly.

121
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,794
At the corner, please.
The Waldorf Astoria.

122
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,395
I gotta go meet somebody.

123
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,472
Take care. Have a nice night.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

124
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,439
Any problems,
you'll want to see Julie Levinson.

125
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,511
She's our Assistant Controller.

126
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,596
But, like I said,
I don't anticipate any problems.

127
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,397
Never had any before.
- Okay. Thanks.

128
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,111
It's really nice out here.
I usually just brown bag it.

129
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,909
You have to get outside. Those fluorescent
lights will kill you. I read about them.

130
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,509
Hello.

131
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,912
Shit. No, I got it here. Hold on.

132
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,435
See if you can change it to the 6:30
ut of JFK flight nbr. 4. Right. Yeah.

133
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,791
Rutherford wants me to join him
in London asap.

134
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,190
We're papering some finance with Lloyds.
I tell you about this? - No.

135
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,636
I'll be gone a couple weeks.
- Sounds sort of interesting.

136
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,712
Gonna be as boring as sin, but...
Anyhow, I gotta get back.

137
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,279
Ready?
- Alright.

138
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,633
That's disgusting.
I don't want to hear that.

139
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,119
Why?

140
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,590
That's repulsive.
Don't ever tell anyone that. Ever.

141
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,150
You're the kind of girl that pees
in front of men, aren't you?

142
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,630
What goes in the Xerox Room
stays in the Xerox room.

143
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,872
Jonathan McQuarry, hello.

144
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,719
Hello?

145
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,476
Wyatt? I've got your cell phone. I guess,
you've got mine. What a pain in the ass.

146
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,994
You're probably in the air right, so,
if you get this, call me on your phone.

147
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,990
I'll speak to you later. Take care.

148
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,149
Mr. Lewman. Hi.
- Hello.

149
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,915
Actually, Mr. Lewman, there was something
I wanted to talk to you about. Excuse me.

150
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,429
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

151
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,115
Look, this isn't actually...
Sorry, could you just hold on a sec?

152
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,476
Mr. Lewman, my bedroom...
I think I have a leak.

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,629
I was hoping you could take a look.
McQuarry. 631.

154
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,390
Right. McQuarry. Yeah,
I'll get to it soon as I can.

155
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,193
Hello? Anyone there?

156
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,478
Hello?
(oman) Are you free tonight?

157
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,473
Actually, I am, but this isn't Wyatt.
- Sorry, I didn't get that.

158
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,591
Well, I am free, but...
- Could you be at The Dylan in one hour?

159
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,671
I guess so, but...

160
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,993
Are you waiting for me?
- Yes, I think so.

161
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,958
Would you like a drink or something?
- No, thanks.

162
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,430
I've got a conference call
with Tokyo early in the morning.

163
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,436
Shall we go?
- Yes.

164
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,392
Have you been in this hotel before?
- No.

165
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,114
Look, the person who you thought
you were talking to isn't me.

166
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,356
You're not who I spoke to on the phone?
- No, no... Yes, yes, I am.

167
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,758
But...
- What's wrong?

168
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,270
Are you not attracted to me?
- Oh, you're beautiful.

169
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,990
It's just you called me
and I came here but I don't...

170
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,152
You don't?
- I'm not too sure what's going on.

171
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,871
You're not too sure what's going on?

172
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,795
Sit down. Sit down.

173
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,550
Hello.
- Hey, you're up early.

174
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,030
Hey! How's London?
- Rainy. So you got mine, I got yours.

175
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,113
Yeah, I must've grabbed it at lunch
before you left.

176
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,749
No big deal. I already had my work calls
forwarded here. - Oh, alright.

177
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,832
So, did I get any calls?
- Yes, you did.

178
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,595
And?
- Well...

179
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,317
What the hell was that?
- I knew it. You met up with someone.

180
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,915
I thought you would call me back.
- Oh, spare me. I woulda done the same.

181
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,310
So howwas it?
- It was really amazing, actually. She...

182
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,518
Shit. I'll call you later. The want me
in a meeting. I wand to hear all about it.

183
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,912
Alright.
- As for my phone, feel free to use it.

184
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,391
Okay. Thanks.

185
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,759
(woman)
Yes?

186
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,833
Hello. Uh...

187
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,911
Yes?
- Are you free tonight?

188
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,038
(woman) Where?
- Where, right.

189
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,998
The Dylan Hotel.
- Perhaps The Park Avenue.

190
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,071
In the bar, half past eleven.

191
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,476
If you are who you don't seem to be,
you're late.

192
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,394
Excuse me?
- Are you?

193
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,432
Late, orwho I'm not supposed to be?

194
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,234
Either.

195
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,036
Yes, I am late,
and I am who I don't seem to be.

196
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,834
Alright, then.

197
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,030
Could you put this on the room, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

198
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,714
I don't have a room.

199
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,232
You're rather newto this, aren't you?

200
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,272
The initiator is responsible for the room.
That's one of the rules.

201
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,238
Oh. So I should...
- Precisely.

202
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,312
Oh. Excuse me.

203
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,556
Frankly, I'm surprised whoever
sponsored you didn't explain more.

204
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,030
Downstairs, you talked about a rule.
Are there others?

205
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,710
No rough stuff. If that's your thing,
take it elsewhere.

206
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,149
No business talk, and no names.
- Right.

207
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,434
How did you get into this?
- A friend of mine...

208
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,796
He introduced you to the list
but failed to explain the basics?

209
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,077
Well, he had to leave town.
I'm doing something wrong here, aren't l?

210
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,436
It's not that. You just strike me
as something of a stowaway.

211
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,115
If it wasn't for the $4,000 suit,
I'd say you didn't belong here at all.

212
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,679
This is us.

213
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,719
Although,
someone obviously thought you did.

214
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,870
And I'm a sucker for bashful boys.

215
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,391
Can I ask you something?

216
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,430
Why do you do this?
- For the same reason that men do it.

217
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,911
The economics of the arrangement.

218
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,749
Intimacy without intricacy.

219
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,311
I work past midnight almost every night.

220
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,477
The last dinner I had that wasn't business
was about a year ago.

221
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,670
Hey, Wyatt, it's Jonathan.
I haven't heard from you, but...

222
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,159
I guess
you must be pretty swamped over there.

223
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,993
Look, I just wanted to say thank you.

224
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,318
Wait. Wait. Before we...

225
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,670
The thing is, I knowyou.
I mean, not "knowyou" exactly.

226
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,158
We met before in the Times Square
subway station. It had been raining,

227
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,630
and you asked me if the train stops
at Canal Street.

228
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,709
No.

229
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,635
Wait. It just feels a little strange,
that's all.

230
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,792
Why? Because you've seen me before?

231
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,589
Maybe. It's just...
- C'mon, what's the problem?

232
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,795
Okay...

233
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,596
I guess it is a little bit
of a gear shift.

234
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,391
Maybe some other time.

235
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,472
Oh, no, please. What I mean is...

236
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,316
By any chance... are you hungry?

237
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,753
Mm, you have a little bit of...
of ketchup on your chin.

238
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,713
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm a messy eater.
- No, it's okay. So am l. Here.

239
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,871
There you go.
- Thank you.

240
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,835
You have a little piece of...
- Oh, what, onion in my hair?

241
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,558
So what do you do for a living?

242
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,436
I sit behind glass
and I watch people pass like fish.

243
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,512
You work in a bank?
- I'm sort of an accountant.

244
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,792
I bet that's what you always
dreamed of being when you grew up.

245
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,440
Oh, yeah, I'm livin' the dream.
Feel free to leave now.

246
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,959
Still here.

247
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,719
But how about you?
- No.

248
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,076
No, no, no, I'm afraid that we're
still on you.

249
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,637
Frank.
- Frank?

250
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,718
You look like a Frank.

251
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,992
By the way, my name is...
- Oh, sh.

252
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,476
You knowthe rules. No names.

253
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,552
Yeah, but the rules seem to specify
no conversation either.

254
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,194
Okay. How 'bout I tell you my name,
if you guess.

255
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,116
Oh, you're in real trouble here.
You see, I am very good at this.

256
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,590
What are you very good at?
- Problem solving. It's what I do.

257
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,078
I'm very good at identifying hierarchical
relationships and binary posits.

258
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,197
Is that right?
- Absolutely.

259
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,078
And this talent can be applied
to finding anything.

260
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,799
For example,
I knowthat your name begins with an S.

261
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,110
How do you knowthat?
- I sawyour key chain on your purse.

262
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,590
Wow. Excellent work.
- Thank you. So, the things we know are

263
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,196
A, your name begins with an S.
B, you have a white coat.

264
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,759
And C...

265
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,752
And C, you do not know
your way around the subway.

266
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,389
That's true.

267
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,473
Now all I do is extrapolate from
these known qualities and your name...

268
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,749
is...

269
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,914
Sybil.

270
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,989
Sophie. You're definitely a Sophie.
- Wait, with an "ie" or a "y"?

271
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,718
Either.
- Neither.

272
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,038
How about Syd, as in Syd Charisse?
- No, she was Syd with a C.

273
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,510
Yeah, but maybe you spell it with an S.
- I do not.

274
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
Sexy Steffi was lookin' for a train...
- No.

275
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,592
Sunbeam.
- Oh, God, do I look like a Sunbeam?

276
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,199
Absolutely.

277
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,879
Well, then, that's it.

278
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,869
I told you I was good at this.
- I'm very impressed.

279
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,554
I'm crashing.

280
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,196
I'd really like to see you again.
Not in a hotel.

281
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,953
Hm, well... we'll see about that.

282
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,795
Maybe tomorrow?.
- It is tomorrow.

283
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,871
Hello?
(Wyatt) Are you free tonight?

284
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,350
Hey, are you back?
- I wish. It's friggin' anarchy here.

285
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,436
Hang on. Hello?

286
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,512
Housekeeping.
- Uh, could you come back? Thanks.

287
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,397
Sorry.
- Where are you?

288
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,153
I'm in the Soho Grand.
- Soho Grand, huh?

289
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,153
Sounds like you've been enjoying yourself.
- I have. I met this girl last night,

290
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,550
and I broke all the rules and I had
an honest-to-God conversation with her.

291
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,030
(Wyatt) That's extremely naughty of you.
Who is she, Romeo?

292
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,909
I have no idea, really. I don't know
very much about her yet, but...

293
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,629
I'm gonna see her again.
- I don't want to dampen your spirits...

294
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,712
What?
- You met her through the list.

295
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,311
She's different. Trust me.

296
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,070
So when are you back?
- Hard to say.

297
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,391
It's back-to-back bullshit here.
But next week, I hope.

298
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,756
Well, good luck.
I'll see you when you get back.

299
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,519
(Wyatt)
You, too.

300
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,034
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

301
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,111
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

302
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,272
Hello?
("S") Hey, are you free tonight?

303
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,033
Can you meet me in Chinatown,
on Doyer Street? Say, eight o'clock?

304
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,349
Okay.

305
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,231
I got you a present.

306
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,758
Thank you.
- It looks great on you.

307
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,519
Let's go.
- Yeah.

308
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,233
We'd like... we'd like one of these.

309
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,516
And... one of these...
oh, and that.

310
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,033
Thank you.

311
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,556
What did you order?
- I have absolutely no idea.

312
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,954
How do you knowwe'll like it?
- How do you knowwe won't?

313
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,918
This is so not my life.

314
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,909
Ever since that night on the subway
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

315
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,991
I'm not sure I believe you.

316
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,391
I mean, you're in a sex club.
I'm not judging you. I'm in there, too.

317
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,393
But don't say you've been
solemnly holding a torch for me for...

318
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,757
Iong now, one month?
- Point taken.

319
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,911
I got you a present.

320
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,718
Oh, he is so cute.

321
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,593
Thank you.

322
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,558
Here.
- Thanks.

323
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,352
What is that?

324
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,159
Ginseng gum.

325
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,993
It's terrible.

326
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,513
I guess
it does sort of taste like hairspray.

327
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,675
I think I got it now.
I think your name is Suki.

328
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,311
What? What are you thinking about?

329
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,994
I don't want to complicate your life.
- No...

330
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,470
I want all the complications you've got.

331
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,751
Maybe you should go?

332
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,152
Maybe you should stay.

333
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,391
I knowwe decided not to rush, but...

334
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,550
Just for the record, I'm doing everything
I can just to apply the brakes here.

335
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,433
Oh, me too.

336
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,108
Our parents would be proud.

337
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,039
But just say...

338
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,199
Say what?

339
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,193
Ifwe acted...

340
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,398
just suddenly tore off the rest of these
clothes to consummate their deep...

341
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,471
human needs in a frenzy of...

342
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,398
Fucking and sucking.

343
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,233
Beautifully put.

344
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,711
You were saying?
- Well...

345
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,910
Who could blame these two people?
- Who could possibly judge them?

346
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,033
Who would know?.

347
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,878
I got it.
- Where are you going?

348
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,389
Ice.

349
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,511
Oh, you gonna get some ice, huh?

350
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,232
There's a machine out in the hallway.
I'll be right back.

351
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,470
I'll get the ice.
You stay here, I'll get the ice.

352
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,674
Jonathan. Wait.
- No, I'll go.

353
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,951
Would you like some help?

354
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,799
I can manage. Thank you.

355
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,391
I can't get the card to work.

356
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,549
Hello?

357
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,389
Hello?

358
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,389
Hello!

359
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,469
Hello?

360
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,353
Sir. Sir!

361
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,069
Mr. McQuarry, Detective Russo.

362
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,552
How're you doing?
- Not too good.

363
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,832
This is Detective Burke.
I need a background check.

364
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,388
Last name McQuarry, first name Jonathan.

365
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,914
Andyou don't know anything about her?

366
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,913
Where she works, where she lives,
her phone number? - Like I said,

367
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,637
all I know about her
is her first name starts with an S.

368
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,711
Is she a prostitute?
- No.

369
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,432
I told you, she's a friend.
- A friend you met in a sex group.

370
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,035
Look, who else is in this sex group?
- I don't know. It's not like that.

371
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,599
It's anonymous.

372
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,950
You walked into the room and saw blood?

373
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,828
Yeah, I saw blood and then someone hit me,
and when I came to she was gone.

374
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,957
And you didn't see who hit you?
- No, they were behind me.

375
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,112
They must've been hiding in the bathroom.
- Well, was there anything stolen?

376
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,590
Your wallet, or jewelry or anything?
- No, I have my wallet.

377
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,797
Look, Detective, please,
you've got to find her.

378
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,031
We can't do anything
until I understand what happened tonight.

379
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,111
I told you what happened tonight.

380
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,512
Have you ever had
experiences like this before?

381
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,751
No. What're you talking about?
- We spoke to the desk clerk,

382
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,831
and he only recalls seeing you check in.

383
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,878
And as for the blood you say you saw,
we checked the room and found nothing.

384
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,952
In fact, the only blood we found
is where you hit your head.

385
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,788
Look, I knowit all sounds...

386
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,630
But I swear there's a woman
in serious trouble right now.

387
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,711
A woman whose name you don't know.

388
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,189
Yes.

389
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,114
Look, clearly, you had a tough night.
- I'm not crazy.

390
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,077
I tell you what. Go home, and if you
remember anything, you give me a call.

391
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,310
Hey, Wyatt, it's me, Jonathan.

392
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,438
Look, something happened to me last night.

393
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,432
Could you call me back
when you get a chance?

394
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,511
I really need to speak to you.

395
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,272
Can I help you?
- I need to speak to Wyatt Bose.

396
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,397
He's one of your attorneys
and in your London office right now.

397
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,234
Maybe I can speak to his assistant.
I need to get in touch with him.

398
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,719
Of course. Just a minute.

399
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,598
Are you sure that you have the right firm?
- Yes, I met him here when I was working.

400
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,956
Wyatt Bose, he's six-one,
he has black hair. Wait.

401
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,749
I have his... I have his card.
You see? Look. Wyatt Bose.

402
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,437
I can assure you there is no one
by this name working in this firm.

403
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,069
No, but I've seen him in these halls.
We smoked pot in the conference room.

404
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,559
Excuse me?

405
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,912
Wait! Hey, wait
I'm trying to get hold ofWyatt.

406
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,434
Who?
- Wyatt Bose. I sawyou talking with him.

407
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,035
You cracked jokes with him in the lobby.
- I crack jokes with a lot of people.

408
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,715
Are you trying to tell me you don't...
- Hey! Easy with the hands. What is this?

409
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,032
He said he was going to London
with a Mr. Rutherford to paper a deal.

410
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,159
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Rutherford
is presently recovering from hip surgery.

411
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,112
In New Jersey.

412
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,312
Yes?
- I'm sorry. I'm looking for Wyatt.

413
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,716
Excuse me. Wyatt?
- Yeah, Wyatt Bose. He lives here.

414
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,190
Uh, in, in this building?
No, I'm sorry, he must be new.

415
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,193
No, not in this building.
In this apartment.

416
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,193
No, wait, that painting.
It's a Gerhard Richter, right? - Yes.

417
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,512
From the gallery in Munich
that Herr Kleiner handled.

418
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,750
The art dealer downstairs.

419
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,230
Downstairs you must mean Mr. Moretti.
But he's in the carpet business.

420
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,711
Young man, are you alright?

421
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,231
She's a looker.
You weren't kidding.

422
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,792
I can see
why she had you all hot and bothered.

423
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,756
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was you.
Where is she?

424
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,389
Wyatt...

425
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,955
I need you to listen. You're starting
next week at Clute-Nichols, yes?

426
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,314
Who are you?

427
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,789
I'm your only shot
at seeing her alive again.

428
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,872
I asked you a fucking question.
- Yes.

429
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,116
Have a seat. Sit down.

430
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,111
As a part of their audit you've temporary
access to all accounts and wire protocols.

431
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,148
That's what this is about?
- Jonathan.

432
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,233
I want you to locate some accounts for me.
You're gonna move some money around.

433
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,316
I can't.
- What?

434
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,790
They're client accounts. There's safety...
- Listen!

435
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,318
I never said client accounts.
I mean some sub-accounts that I know of,

436
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,313
outside the realm of your audit.
Masked accounts. Slush funds.

437
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,398
Typical insider stuff, you know.
20 mil or so,

438
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,119
skimmed into a quiet account
for a rainy day.

439
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,317
You don't think they'll notice
when it's gone? - Eventually, yes.

440
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,472
But they won't do shit about 'em
'cause it's dirtymoney.

441
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,632
I can't.
- This isn't a negotiation, Jonathan.

442
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,432
Besides, we're friends, remember?

443
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,156
I'm warning you. Don't try and be a hero,
'cause people are gonna get hurt.

444
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,518
And you go to the cops, I'll make it look
like you cut her pretty little head off.

445
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,238
Don't hurt her.
- Just do as you're instructed,

446
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,954
and you'll have her back in no time.
- And why should I trust you?

447
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,270
Everything you told me was a lie.
- Oh, not lies, Jonathan.

448
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,310
That was foreplay.
And nowyou're fucked.

449
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,119
I'll be watching.

450
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,589
Hello?

451
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,473
You have one new voice message.

452
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,910
New message one.

453
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,472
Are you free tonight? It's me, Tina.
I'm in town. I want to see you again.

454
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,799
6 months is way too long.
I'm at The Rhiga, Room 802.

455
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,398
You better show. You owe me.
After all, I was your first.

456
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,950
Hello. This is the front desk.
Your guest has arrived.

457
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,598
You can go on up.
- Thank you.

458
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,798
Who are you? What are you doing here?
- I believe I was invited.

459
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,031
You have the wrong room.
- You didn't leave me a message,

460
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,111
asking if I was free tonight?

461
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,508
I must've dialed the wrong number.

462
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,792
Look, I meant to call someone else.
I'm sorry.

463
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,076
I need to speakwith you about Wyatt.

464
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,270
I just need to ask you a few questions,
okay?

465
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,193
I'm sorry, I don't know any Wyatt.
- Bullshit. You left him a message,

466
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,272
asking him to meet you here.
- I thought you said...

467
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,031
Who are you? How did you...

468
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,995
What? No! I just need a few answers.

469
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,598
My name is Jonathan McQuarry.
I knowyou have no reason to help me,

470
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,717
or even to believe me,
but I need to know about Wyatt.

471
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,430
I told you, I don't know any Wyatt.
- That's the name of the guy you called.

472
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,709
No, it isn't.

473
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,913
I'm sorry.

474
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,113
I'm really sorry.

475
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,589
I'm really in trouble,
and this guy, he's...

476
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,952
he's dangerous.

477
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,398
It was in Chicago about a year ago, at a
private function sponsored by my firm.

478
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,757
He was attending as a guest.
- A guest of who?

479
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,718
A guy called Hollaway. Rudolph Holloway.
I think they played tennis together.

480
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,271
He told me he'd just moved from Frisco
and was in-between jobs.

481
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,878
He was extremely smart.

482
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,396
I know it sounds silly, but he had this
way of making me feel close to him.

483
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,031
I found myself telling him things.

484
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,238
I told him about this.

485
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,397
You told him about the list.

486
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,829
Yes.

487
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,358
There was something about him.
Something terrifying.

488
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,031
So why did you call him again?

489
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,032
You knowwhen it's so good

00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,512
You want to kill someone. You wanna kill
the person you're doing it with.

491
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,835
Fuck it. Y'knowwhat?
He was a good lay.

492

Jamie Getz.
