Then, the assistant principal
decides to call in the SRO,

658
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,213
and this is, to my lawyer brain,
that's the really big choice,

659
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,882
because that's making the SRO,

660
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,303
the enforcer
to school discipline, right?

661
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,722
Shakara's behavior
hasn't gotten more disruptive.

662
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,266
Bringing the officer in
is what makes it

663
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,351
more disruptive
to the other students.

664
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,020
So somebody beside me
was just like,

665
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,188
"Oh snap, he finna get Fields."

666
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,732
And I'm thinking like,
"What they talking about?

667
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,525
Like, who is Fields?"

668
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,819
Um, an administrator
on the third floor

669
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,362
called for a deputy.

670
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,115
Not for me specifically,
but for a deputy.

671
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,534
My office is on the first floor
and I went ahead

672
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,578
and got up to the third floor.

673
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,330
He says that, um,

674
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,750
he had a young lady who was
refusing to leave class.

675
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,168
I said, "What do you mean
she's refusing to leave class?"

676
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,878
"Well, she's refusing
to leave class."

677
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,546
So, we tried
to call her teacher,

678
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,256
because she was in
one of these classes

679
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,384
where they get some extra help
or whatever the case may be.

680
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,762
Uh, the teacher
wasn't available.

681
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,847
Then, the officer
does have a choice, right?

682
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,390
What am I gonna do?

683
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,478
It's the structure
that puts SROs in a position

684
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,482
where every crime is
supposed to be reported to them.

685
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,650
Any disturbance is a crime,

686
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,944
so lots of conduct is supposed
to get reported to them,

687
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,072
and his duty
is to enforce the law.

688
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,032
At that point in time
I decide that,

689
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,409
based on the circumstances
of what we have,

690
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,745
that I'm gonna go in
and remove her

691
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,288
from the classroom.

692
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,956
So, I walked in the classroom,

693
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,959
and when I saw her, I--
right away I recognized her.

694
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,170
Uh, I'd dealt with her before
on two prior fights

695
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,381
that she had had
at Spring Valley.

696
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,342
Um, and both of which
I felt like,

697
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,135
uh, that she was put--
picked on,

698
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,845
pushed into a corner
a little bit, and--

699
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,806
And kinda fought her way out of.

700
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,682
Both of which
I didn't arrest for.

701
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,519
Both of which I felt sorry

00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,229
what was going on?

1218
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,648
Like...

1219
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,734
I don't remember a time
up to the age of 13

1220
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,320
I wasn't fighting somebody off
my Black body,

1221
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,406
my Black female body.

1222
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,534
Then I was punished because
I wanted to dress in pants

1223
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,244
because I'm like,
shit if I got on pants

1224
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:15,247
you can't get up there
easy enough.

1225
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,958
So when I saw that video,
a lot of stuff came up for me

1226
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,294
and I was like, no, they don't
get to walk this alone.

1227
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:21,962
I know what it means
to walk it alone.

1228
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,257
They don't get to have that.

1229
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,344
No, and then you said, "No,
you don't treat her like this"

1230
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,679
and you get arrested.

1231
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,724
Oh, come on, no, no, no, no, No.

1232
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:37,060
Kids get to be
beautiful and loved

1233
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,980
and they get to feel their
full expression of themselves

1234
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:45,819
and not feel like, oh,
if I'm not this, I'm not okay.

1235
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,280
Like, they were born whole,
perfect, and complete.

1236
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,325
It's up to us to keep it
like that, not them.

1237
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:55,203
It's our responsibility.

1238
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,997
-So...
-Right.

1239
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,248
-I know.

1240
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,792
I'm good.

1241
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,004
(laughing)

1242
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:13,013
♪

1243
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,432
So one of the things
happening this week,

1244
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:20,729
I'll be in a conversation
with the officer

1245
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,608
who assaulted Shakara
in the classroom, Ben Fields.

1246
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,861
Um...

1247
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:32,491
hoping that we can have a very
clear and honest conversation.

1248
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,077
Be honest, once you went in
there you saw a criminal.

1249
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,578
You didn't see a little girl.

1250
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,875
You didn't see this,
you know, own it.

1251
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,962
But we'll see how open
and honest he's ready to be

1252
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,422
and where he looks at
what's next?

1253
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,133
You represent a system and what
it--what needs to be changed

1254
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,595
in that system
from his perspective?

1255
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,224
It, it's just, woo, it's a lot.

1256
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:01,144
It's a lot.

1257
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:10,988
♪

1258
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,004
Okay, there's an elephant
in the room.

1259
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,382
Be very clear,
when this went down was I like,

1260
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,801
oh, there's a grown man
who just assaulted a child?

1261
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,302
Yes, I did.

1262
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,512
For a girl who wouldn't get out
of her chair.

1263
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,264
-Right, right.
-That's a child.

1264
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,057
Oh my God,
this is a little girl.

1265
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,101
Is there any other way
that this could've gone down?

1266
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,562
This is like just insane.

1267
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,648
And I still can't understand
why it hasn't been like,

1268
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,776
"Shakara, I apologize.
It should a looked different."

1269
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,194
There hasn't been an apology.

1270
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,157
I think she is owed one.

1271
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,700
Okay.

1272
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,997
You're critical of--of the
situation and critical of me.

1273
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,832
I think that's fine.
I was acting

1274
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,043
as a uniformed police officer,
obviously, I was terminated for

1275
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,754
the incident
for the use of force

1276
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:12,257
because the sheriff felt like
it was improper. Okay?

1277
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,551
Uh, but certainly
it wasn't, you know,

1278
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,970
it wasn't an assault in any way,
shape, or form.

1279
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,222
You know, I was a political
victim in this situation,

1280
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,517
meaning I was cut loose because
politically it made sense.

1281
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,228
If I follow policy and procedure
and I follow the law,

1282
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,980
there's nothing more
I can do because

1283
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,441
that's my responsibility,
that's the oath that I took.

1284
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,861
Uh, I just, I continue to,
on a law enforcement level,

1285
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,448
I stand by what I did that day.

1286
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:41,244
So you said you came in and from
the eyes of a police officer

1287
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,039
it didn't have to go that far,
but if I'm looking at a criminal

1288
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,166
and not a child,
yeah, it can go that far.

1289
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,460
Because I read the reports.

1290
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,463
The class wasn't really
interrupted until this teacher

1291
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,049
got upset
that she wouldn't leave.

1292
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:57,469
Why not remove the other kids
and handle her?

1293
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:58,970
Because you've said
you've known her before

1294
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,473
so it was some deeper stuff.

1295
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,391
So there could have been a like,
"Shakara, what is it

1296
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,310
that's making you
not want to leave?"

1297
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,937
Well, there's certainly--
and there's people close to me

1298
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,730
that feel the same way you do
about that situation

1299
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,941
when you talk about classroom
management and things like that.

1300
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,360
So it's not the first time
I've heard that and that's fair.

1301
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,487
If I went to--If I was patrol
and I got called

1302
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,115
to a movie theater to remove
somebody from the movie theater,

1303
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,783
I wouldn't ask
the movie theater to leave.

1304
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,035
Or I went to a restaurant
and needed to remove somebody

1305
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,829
from a restaurant, I wouldn't
ask the restaurant to leave,

1306
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,706
right? And so I viewed it
from a police standpoint.

1307
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,417
And that's, that's where we keep
going back to the system

1308
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,294
that created this to happen.

1309
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,255
You haven't been my focus.

1310
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,215
The system has been my focus.

1311
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,259
I don't believe police
should be in schools.

1312
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,262
There's no reason that you
should've been called in period.

1313
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:41,888
-All right, I got you.
-Yeah.

1314
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,141
So let me, let me say
a couple things.

1315
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,018
One is I would say, obviously,
you know, we know that SROs

1316
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,688
in a school doesn't mean safety.
I don't disagree with that.

1317
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,981
One of the biggest issues
for me right now

1318
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,816
is they're sticking SROs
in schools

1319
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,819
who aren't even
trained properly,

1320
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,487
but you've got to move the goal
post back a little bit.

1321
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,989
It's okay to discipline kids.

1322
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,782
It's okay to hold
kids accountable.

1323
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,368
I'm not saying kids don't get
to be held accountable.

1324
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,620
All we're saying is like,
what does that accountability

1325
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,915
look like?
We should not have a law

1326
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,459
where kids are being arrested
for things

1327
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,172
that they can't get arrested
outside on the streets for.

1328
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,798
Look at the system.

1329
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,009
What system
are you referring to?

1330
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,178
You say the system,
we need to change the system.

1331
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,679
Uh, help me understand
that a little bit.

1332
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,432
So when I say system
I'm talking about governmental,

1333
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:29,603
education, institutionalized
racism, all the policies

1334
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,646
that we create, all the laws
that we create,

1335
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,440
that's what I mean
about the system.

1336
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,611
Okay, so, you know, you know,
uh, the systematic racism

1337
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,696
and all this kind of stuff,
I think it's talking points.

1338
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,157
I think it sounds really good
on its face,

1339
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,034
but it's one of those things
where we're taking the onus

1340
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,578
again off the kids and saying,
"Hey, you're not responsible

1341
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,580
for your bad behavior,
what we're going to do is

1342
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,498
we're going to
blame it on the system."

1343
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,792
And one of the things that,
you know, we looked at with

1344
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,711
the disturbing school law,
it was brought up a lot,

1345
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:56,630
was a disproportional amount
of Black kids

1346
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,673
were arrested to white kids,
right?

1347
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,634
And a disproportional amount
of Black kids were suspended

1348
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,385
to white kids, I mean,
as you look at it as a whole,

1349
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:03,887
I mean,
you go to any school district

1350
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:05,722
and that's going to be the case.
Okay.

1351
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,266
Why is that happening
in your opinion?

1352
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,228
There is a tendency
to think that Black kids

1353
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,480
are automatically at fault.

1354
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:16,191
This one was running
the hallways and this one

1355
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,860
was running the hallways,
yet this one got the discipline

1356
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,528
referral and this one was like,
"Well, you know

1357
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,948
you can't do that."
It's something going on.

1358
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,367
There is a way that
we're with young people

1359
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,703
depending on if they're white
versus children of color.

1360
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,705
And that's been statistically
proven.

1361
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,750
In these schools where the, um,

1362
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,086
where it was disproportional
they also have Black deputies.

1363
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,588
How do you explain that?
Are these, Black deputies

1364
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,633
and these Black teachers,
are they part of the system

1365
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,385
that's hurting,
um, Black people?

1366
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,263
Absolutely, then we talk about
internalized oppression.

1367
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,599
So if I see that I've been
trained all my life

1368
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:53,311
that this is better than this,
I push that same narrative

1369
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,106
and I act in accordance to,
SO yes.

1370
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,899
We can go all day
on the problems.

1371
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,027
I don't--I can't talk about
problems too much

1372
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,654
because we already know
they're there.

1373
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,864
My focus is, how do
we create solutions?

1374
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,908
How do we create solutions?

1375
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,077
And we keep talking about
holding kids accountable,

1376
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,079
but we get to hold
adults accountable too,

1377
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,123
because we're responsible
for the next generation.

1378
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,959
-We really are.

expulsions, and arrests.

01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,476
We get all those numbers down
quite frequently

1517
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,770

I'd also like to acknowledge
that we have with us Ben Fields.

1527
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,339
His claim to fame
is he did his job

they should watch that video.

1543
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,715
Because certainly
no learning was taking place

1544
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,508
while that girl was being
dragged across the room.

1545
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,510
Certainly no learning
was taking place that day,

1546
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,554
the week that followed, for the
months that followed thereafter,

1547
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,015
while those students have
to live the aftermath

1548
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,558
of witnessing that in school
and wondering

1549
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,894
if that will happen
to them again.

1550
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,104
I asked the young lady if she
would get up and come with me.

1551
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,064
She said, no,
she hadn't done anything wrong.

1552
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,193
To which my response was,
"I hadn't said you did,

1553
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,278
but get your stuff
and come with me. You know me.

1554
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,405
You know I'm a fair guy.
I've dealt with you before."

1555
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,365
To which again she refused.

1556
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,242
And at that point in time
I approached her

1557
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,244
and went to place her under
arrest and the fight was on.

1558
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,579
She cracked me in the jaw.

1559
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,164
She pulled away from me.

1560
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:34,665
I got her out of the chair.

1561
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,334
And the getting out
of the chair part

1562
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,252
is the part that went viral.

1563
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,964
Schools need good,
fair, firm discipline.

1564
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,219
Look towards me, not the camera,
I'll just get you to say

1565
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,346
-and spell your name for me.
-All right, Ben Fields,

1566
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:51,224
-B-E-N, last name, F-I-E-L-D-♪.
-Tell me why

1567
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,434
-you wanted to be here?
-We're not allowing teachers,

1568
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,894
administrators, and for this,

1569
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:57,647
for that matter police officers
to do their jobs

1570
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,441
to keep schools safe...

1571
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,693
One of the things I talk about
a lot is the whole race thing.

1572
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,821
This thing is about race, right?

1573
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,697
And so what happens is,
is you have--

1574
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,241
You have Black and white people

1575
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,202
who every day get along
really well.

1576
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,913
You have Black and white people
who coexist on a daily basis.

1577
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,832
They work together, they go to
school together,

1578
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,542
and they get along together.

1579
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,837
And what happens
is the media takes something

1580
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:24,173
and they try to divide us,
meaning the regular

1581
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:28,177
everyday working class person
who really makes

1582
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,138
this country tick,
and they try to make us think

1583
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,016
that civil rights
just ended yesterday,

1584
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,977
that slavery just
ended yesterday,

1585
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,688
and that, you know, the racial
disparities in this country

1586
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,815
are so great.

1587
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,483
My story was a good story
because it was

1588
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,778
a white deputy and a Black girl.

1589
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,865
She made the decision to fight
a uniformed officer that day.

1590
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,576
And the only person that was
ever punished that day was who?

1591
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:54,620
Ben Fields. I lost my job.

1592
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,874
Regardless of anything else,

1593
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:02,211
Ben Fields was the only one
punished out of that situation.

1594
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:05,006
(rain pattering)

1595
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:08,175
When you can't trace the past
into the present,

1596
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,137
you are left with deeply
problematic explanations

1597
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,974
for current conditions.
Victim blaming explanations.

1598
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,852
I'm thinking about Trayvon
Martin and I saw an interview

1599
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,771
with one of the jurors
who said that George Zimmerman

1600
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:24,609
just seemed like such
a nice guy, so relatable.

1601
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,360
And I think that's worth noting.

1602
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,071
Trayvon Martin, he didn't seem
like a nice child

1603
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,616
or didn't seem relatable?
He seemed threatening?

1604
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,826
But George Zimmerman with a gun,

1605
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,954
he seemed like a nice guy
and relatable?

1606
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,207
So because Black people are seen
as inherently criminal,

1607
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:44,503
Black children are also seen as
inherently criminal.

1608
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,965
The core concern I have
is that we know now.

1609
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,927
It's not an open question.
We know conclusively

1610
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:54,555
from research that
Black kids do not engage

1611
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,517
in more disciplinable type
offenses in their schools.

1612
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,645
It is not that there's a
particular gene for Black kids

1613
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:03,147
that makes them misbehave more.
That's not accurate.

1614
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,901
And so, we need to throw away
that frankly racist notion

1615
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:10,696
that kids of color are worse,

1616
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,408
and educate all of our kids
like we believe in them.

1617
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,370
Educate all of our kids like
they're valuable and treat them

1618
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:22,208
like they are somebody's beloved
baby in that classroom.

1619
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,798
Mm, I'm just frustrated.

1620
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:33,177
About a lot.

1621
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,012
You know,
I feel that once I put,

1622
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,057
every time I put one step
forward I'm taking two back

1623
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:40,309
or like I can be on a good path

1624
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,521
and then something just come
and set me all the way back.

1625
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:53,364
What made you come back
to your mom's?

1626
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,116
My sister.

1627
01:14:55,408 --> 01:15:01,163
Just being there for her,
that was the whole reason.

1628
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,458
Once again with
the unhealed trauma.

1629
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:09,338
If you talk to her,
I often call it wisdom.

1630
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,757
She's one of those people that
your grandparents would be like,

1631
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,927
"That's a wise child."
Her dreams and her hope

1632
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,264
and that passion that
she has for certain things,

1633
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:21,642
but all these barriers
upon barriers.

1634
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:26,105
Are you okay?

1635
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:29,483
What do you need to be okay?

1636
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:34,655
That incident it sheds a light

1637
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:39,368
on how quickly we are
to like just leave people.

1638
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,246
There's a lot at stake.

1639
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,582
Well, what we can do is we do
like a practice test

1640
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,626
on just maybe that section or
just, you know,

1641
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,587
work on that for a while
until you really, really

1642
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,213
feel like you have it.

1643
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,257
Like some of this is easy
because I know how to do

1644
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,801
the multiplication
so that's how I do division,

1645
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,429
but then when I get to like this
It's confusing.

1646
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,056
Okay.

1647
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,184
Hopefully, just zone in.

1648
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,643
The only pressure
that you have is,

1649
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,146
you know,
whatever you put on yourself.

1650
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:11,984
Like you've already come so far,
So, you know,

1651
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,360
but especially getting
that close

1652
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,613
and you've only
got one more piece.

1653
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:20,117
I know you can do it.

1654
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,037
Well, with these--
So with these...

1655
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:27,583
and I'm assuming you don't get
a calculator with this.

1656
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:37,093
♪

1657
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,897
What was Charlotte? What
happened in Charlotte today?

1658
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,650
Okay, so Charlotte today was,
an individual

1659
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:56,737
from the Manhattan Institute
who went down to Parkland

1660
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,447
where the shooting took place.

1661
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,658
And what he did is he took
a look--and this all kind of

1662
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,244
evolves around what, school
safety and things like that,

1663
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:04,954
some of the stuff
I've been talking about.

1664
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,580
This kid's criminal
and bad behavior

1665
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,624
-was ignored by administrators.
-Right.

1666
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,503
Constantly and because it was
this kid was able to get

1667
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,880
and buy guns because
he had no criminal record.

1668
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,508
And the shooting really could've
been avoided in every way.

1669
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,552
And what's happening
is it's being ignored because

1670
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:21,595
they want their arrest numbers
down, they want

1671
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,681
discipline numbers down,
and that's essentially

1672
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,392
-what it's about.
-We'll say his behavior

1673
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,352
kept being ignored
all this time.

1674
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,855
I'm going to say a child kept
being ignored all this time.

1675
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,690
When you're talking
a criminal you're definitely

1676
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,400
talking about a criminal,
somebody who goes

1677
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,528
and shoots everybody is a
criminal, no doubt about it.

1678
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,739
But it looks as though
when it starts with a teacher

1679
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,992
calling for assistance
'cause a student

1680
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:46,662
is not putting away their phone
or closing their book

1681
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:49,165
or being compliant
with what they're saying

1682
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,668
is the same as someone
who would pick up a gun

1683
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,795
-and go shoot their classmates.
-Obviously, there's no

1684
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:58,465
comparison between somebody
who kills 16 students, right?

1685
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,842
And then somebody who was just--

1686
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,969
Because Black girls aren't doing
that.

1687
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:05,264
Understand something,
who was disrupting a classroom

1688
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:06,724
and then resisted
a lawful arrest,

1689
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,517
which is what happened
in my situation.

1690
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,895
You can like it or not,
but that's what happened.

1691
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,355
My point is simply this,
bad behavior

1692
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,524
is being ignored in schools.

1693
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,110
But if the automatic label
is criminal,

1694
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,279
there's already
all these things.

1695
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,865
That--that's, criminal behavior
is criminal behavior.

1696
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,701
It is not criminal for me
to roll my eyes at a teacher.

1697
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,329
Let's be human,
there are certain people

1698
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,081
who get the benefit
of being humanized,

1699
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:36,754
no matter how grotesque
the behavior can be, i.e.

1700
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,756
when we think about Dylann Roof,

1701
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,633
dude gets to go to Burger King
and get a burger

1702
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,384
after you have just murdered
nine people.

1703
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,011
-But for her-
-Those are--those are conspiracy

1704
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:45,554
theories and let me,
let me, let me stop you.

1705
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,056
Dylann Roof was
a conspiracy theory?

1706
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:48,224
Whoa, whoa, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

1707
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:49,350
You didn't see this on the news?

1708
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,976
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm not saying it's not

1709
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,437
the truth, but what I'm saying
is in interrogations

1710
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,106
we give suspects food
all the time.

1711
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,900
That's not
an uncommon thing to do.

1712
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,902
He gets to be interrogated.

1713
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:03,072
African Americans
primarily get to be dead

1714
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,323
before they're even questioned.

1715
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,866
That's--that's false, but okay.

1716
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,368
-It's false, Ben?
-It is false.

1717
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:08,244
-How is it false?
-That's a false statement.

1718
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,870
Okay, Walter Scott.

1719
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,289
Was he, was he--
Did he get to be interrogated?

1720
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,916
You're making blanket statements
about things

1721
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,085
that you're not educated on,
and I'm not--

1722
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,003
What I'm getting at you're
missing my point, though.

1723
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,381
The Walter Scott situation,
where that cop shot and killed

1724
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,675
Walter Scott, right?

1725
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,052
He is now doing 20 years
in prison, is he not?

1726
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,638
Yeah, but Phil an do Castile,
he says,

1727
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,809
"I have a concealed weapon
and I have a permit."

1728
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:35,646
-Shot and killed in his car--
-And that cop was charged.

1729
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:38,148
Yeah, but the thing is,
it occurred.

1730
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,859
And you wanna keep--I'm not
talking about the after.

1731
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,487
Hear me, white kids and
Black kids do the same things,

1732
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,239
they get different levels of
punishment, and that's the--

1733
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,866
And we disagree on that,
100% disagree.

1734
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,369
Yeah, you shouldn't be working
with kids, I'm sorry.

1735
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,038
What I'm saying is--Listen,
do you understand what my--

1736
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,625
And I said this, bad behavior's
being ignored was the point.

1737
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,377
-And I said that, that's right.
-This mass shooting

1738
01:19:58,669 --> 01:19:59,628
could have been avoided,
that's my point.

1739
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,172
Right and bad behavior--
and I said,

1740
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,675
bad behavior's
being ignored among police.

1741
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,761
-And you can't accept that.
-Okay.

1742
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,973
I want you to understand
that where you were

1743
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,808
and what Charlotte was about,

1744
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,229
does color and play into

1745
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:20,649
how you think about
what we're talking about.

1746
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,945
I'm not even going to continue
to try to explain that

1747
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,114
because yeah, right, right.

1748
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,992
You know,
because I don't feel

1749
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,995
this feeling from you that
you actually really care.

1750
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,789
You care, but the breadth
of your reading

1751
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,875
is confined within one area.

1752
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,794
Because that supports
the thoughts and the ideas

1753
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:45,883
that you want to foster, that's
going to continue to tell you

1754
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:49,303
that nothing you did was wrong
in the situation with Shakara.

1755
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,013
That's what--that's what
we need to be.

1756
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,639
So we--so we--So, I definitely
didn't do anything wrong

1757
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,350
in that situation,
but here's the point,

1758
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,602
we can disagree on it, so
disagreeing is turning into

1759
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,228
you attacking me personally now.

1760
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,897
But that's what
you've been doing all night.

1761
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:00,939
I didn't say anything
about you personally.

1762
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,358
You've been slugging all night,
dude!

1763
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:06,362
Hmm, okay, all right.

1764
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,864
I think this is a good example
of the burden that,

1765
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:12,201
that Black people bear in trying
to educate White people.

1766
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:15,120
This is one of the reasons you
hear more and more, Black people

1767
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,581
saying, "White people,
go talk to your own.

1768
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,709
It's nowhere near as exhausting

1769
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,380
and demoralizing
as it is for us."

1770
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:30,177
Defensiveness that functions
to refuse any challenge

1771
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:32,429
to your world view, any growth,

1772
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:35,432
any opening,
that's white fragility.

1773
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,559
And that's what
we're seeing in Ben,

1774
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,562
an absolute refusal in the face

1775
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:44,525
of incredible
opportunity for growth.

1776
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:49,655
An opportunity to bear witness
to the impact

1777
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:52,658
that seeing this happen
to this girl

1778
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,702
had on so many Black people.

1779
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:59,081
He refuses it.

01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:26,567
A little over two years ago,
I came here to hug two girls,

1787
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:27,860
who should a never experienced

1788

what any child should
experience.

1789
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,991
And I literally, only came here
to stay for two days,

1790
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,785
so to look out right now
and to know what

1791
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:41,123
we've been doing,
and how many girls I got to hug,

1792
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:42,875
I'm having a moment.

Black girl,

no matter what this world
tells us,

1797
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,977
you are loved,

1798
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:04,229
you are supported,

1799
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:08,400
and you are beyond magical.

1800
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:13,864
We chose these grounds because
the South got something to say,

1801
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,825
and even more so, we got
something to teach.

(clapping)

1803
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,413

your attention to

Bree is the woman who climbed up
the flagpole on these grounds

1806
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,089

(cheering)

1809
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:38,096
I was, in that moment,
representing everyone

1810
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,849
who has contributed to the
struggle for hundreds of years,

1811
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,976
the struggle
that has been going on.

1812
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,521
I wasn't without fear, I just
had a belief in something

1813
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:48,148
that's greater than my fear,
and I have a determination

1814
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,399
to fight for it.

1815
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,985
Come on, yes!

1816

moment for me in so many ways.

1869
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,935
So I had to rearrange my
classroom to make sure

1870
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,938
that she was comfortable,
for her not to fear

1871

of someone coming up behind her.

1872
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,903
And she expressed that,
"Hey, I'm not good in math."

1873
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:24,740
And I told her, "Neither am I!
I'm a reading teacher!"

Teachers matter!

2043
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:17,355
I'm here today
with a call to action.

2044
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:23,236
We demand to divest from police
and invest in our children.

2045
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:28,283
This demand is not new, let's
talk about Spring Valley, 2015,

2046
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:31,327
when a school resource officer
assaulted a child

2047
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,955
for not giving her cell phone.

2048
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:38,167
What is safe
or resourceful about that?

2049
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,460
Think about that
when we're talking about

2050
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:42,505
removing policing from schools.

2051
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:46,384
I need each of you to contact
your school boards, your mayor,

2052
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:49,304
and your governor,
and tell them police officers

2053
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:53,641
get to be removed
and invest in social services,

2054
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:57,562
education, our teachers,
because our children's lives

2055
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:01,566
depend on it,
but also I'm very clear

2056
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:04,152
And Imma get emotional,
I know I am.

2057
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,029
They don't have to keep showing
up for the fight

2058
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:08,823

had for them a long time ago.

We're at the tipping point.

2061
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:16,789
And I think we've actually
tipped over.

2062
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:19,625
We gonna change it now,
or we'll never change it again.

So I'm headed to Michigan
in the middle of a pandemic,

2079
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:21,396
because a girl, who we are
referring to as Grace,

2080
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:26,401
was arrested for failing to
complete her online schoolwork.
