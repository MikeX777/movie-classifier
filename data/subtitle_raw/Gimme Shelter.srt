1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,065
Everybody seems to be ready.
Are you ready?

2
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:29,866
For the first time
in three years,

3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,569
the greatest rock 'n 'roll band
in the world, the Rolling Stones!

4
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:37,545
- The Rolling Stones!!

5
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:39,912
We're gonna have a look at you.

6
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:43,850
We're gonna see
how beautifulyou are.

7
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,410
Whoo!! All right!

8
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,056
Oh, New York City, you talk a lot.

9
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,527
Let's have a look at you.

10
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:01,630
Let's have a look at New York City.

11
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:06,295
Whoo!

12
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,600
Well, all right!

13
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:16,274
Welcome to the breakfast show.

14
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:43,189
Whoo!

15
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,226
Yeah!

16
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,620
Thank you. Whoo!
Thank you.

17
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:43,456
We're just gonna wake up.

18
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:56,930
Well, all right!

19
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:00,271
Charlie's good tonight,
isn't he?

20
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:04,575
I think you really--
you really dressed up tonight.

21
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:07,615
Aren't they?
We'd like to see how you look.

22
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,119
Can we see how they look?

23
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:17,490
Let's have a look how they look.

24
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:19,583
Come on.

25
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,694
Oh, we just want
to see how they look.

26
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:28,292
Ohhh, we couldn't see you!

27
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,932
We couldn't see you.

28
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,240
It's really hard
to see this together, isn't it?

29
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,244
It will take time.

30
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:43,280
- What?
- Eight weeks.

31
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:45,577
Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.

32
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,015
Do you think you can
do it that quick?

33
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:51,953
This gives us the freedom.
All you guys watching us.

34
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,649
We may only be on you
for a minute,

35
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:56,919
then go to almost anything.

36
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:03,561
This is Stefan Ponek,
KSAN Radio, San Francisco.

37
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:06,499
Well, the Rolling Stones' tour
of the United States is over.

38
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:11,266
They wound it up with a free
concert at the Altamont Speedway
for more than 300,000 people.

39
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,297
There were four births, four deaths
and an awful lot of scuffles reported.

40
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,401
We received word that someone
was stabbed to death...

41
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,276
in front of the stage
by a member of the Hell's Angels.

42
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,406
Nothing's confirmed on that.
We were there.

43
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,712
We didn't see it,
but we did see a lot.

44
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:28,548
We want to know what you saw.
Our phones are open.

45
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,386
We'd like to hear from you. What
was the Altamont free concert like?

46
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:37,292
The Angels did as they saw best
in the difficult situation.

47
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:41,058
As far as I'm concerned,
they were people who were here...

48
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,361
who tried to help
in their own way.

49
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:46,402
- Right? You know?
- Hmm. Right.

50
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,768
If people didn't dig it,
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,207
That was Sam Cutler, one of the
organizers of the free concert.

52
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:56,972
I think we've got one of
the Hell's Angels on the line.

53
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,741
Sonny Barger.
Have I got that right, Sonny?

54
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:02,044
- Yeah.
- Okay, what's up?

55
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,676
I didn't go there
to police nothing, man.

56
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:08,482
I ain't no cop. I ain't never
gonna pretend to be a cop.

57
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:11,319
And this Mick Jagger, like--

58
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,620
put it all on the Angels, man.

59
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:16,127
Like, he used us for dupes, man.

60
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:20,393
And as far as I'm concerned,
we were the biggest suckers for
that idiot that I can ever see.

61
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,660
And you know what?
They told me...

62
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,964
if I could sit
on the edge of the stage...

63
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:27,436
so nobody would climb
over me, you know,

64
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,871
I could drink beer
until the show was over.

65
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,636
That's what I went there to do.
But you know what?

66
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,146
When they started messing over
our bikes, they started it.

67
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,407
I don't know if you think
we pay $50 for them things...

68
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:42,076
or steal them
or pay a lot for them or what.

69
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,915
Ain't nobody
gonna kick my motorcycle.

70
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:48,821
And they might think because they're
in a crowd of 300,000 people...

71
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:51,325
that they can do it
and get away with it.

72
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:54,657
But when you're standing there,
looking at something that's your life,

73
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,562
and everything you've got
is invested in that thing,

74
00:07:57,632 --> 00:08:00,567
and you love that thing better
than anything in the world,

75
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:03,330
and you see a guy kick it,
you know who he is.

76
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:07,134
You're gonna get him.
And you know what? They got got.

77
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:10,175
I am not no peace creep
by any sense of the word.

78
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:13,177
And you can call them people
flower children and this and that.

79
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:15,805
Some of them people
was loaded on some drugs...

80
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:18,906
that it's just too bad
we wasn't loaded on...

81
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:22,919
because they come running up the hill,
yelling "Aaaah" and jump on somebody.

82
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,716
And it wasn't even always
jumping on Angels.

83
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:28,622
But when they jumped
on an Angel, they got hurt.

84
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,095
Well done, Sonny.

85
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:44,534
I think I remember him.
Do you?

86
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:47,336
No, I'm not certain.

87
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:51,105
I don't really remember
what he looked like.

88
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,075
There was a couple of them
before we went on.

89
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:04,556
They were really very nice, you know?
A couple of them guys.

90
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:08,821
It's just, uh--

91
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:10,828
I don't know.

92
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,335
I mean, the way they cleared the path,
for instance, was incredible.

93
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:23,998
Were you there? Was you in the party
that had to be led to the stage?

94
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:27,407
- My goodness.
- I saw what they did, yeah.

95
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:30,206
That was insane.

96
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,372
What did they do?

97
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:36,116
Well, it's just the way
they did it, you know?

98
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:39,381
It's very, very--

99
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:44,391
'Cause before that,
I didn't really think there
was anything going on, you know?

100
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,827
Really. I didn't hear anything
'cause we were right at the side.

101
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,394
Oh, dear, what a shame!

102
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:58,870
KSAN Radio here. The violence
at Altamont was completely unexpected.

103
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:01,667
The Rolling Stones had performed
for overflow audiences...

104
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,107
without incident in major cities
across the United States.

105
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:12,742
Okay, roll it.

106
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:09,167
Whoo! Yeah!

107
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:30,048
Thank you.
Well, all right.

108
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:38,329
Well, all right!
Well, all right!

109
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:43,638
Well, all right!

110
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:46,230
Whoo!

111
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:49,573
Are you any more satisfied
as far as your career goes?

112
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,476
Do you mean sexually
or, or philosophically?

113
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:59,815
- Both.
- Yeah, we're more satisfied
now sexually, aren't--

114
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,890
How about philosophically
and financially?

115
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,757
Financially dissatisfied,
uh, you know.

116
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:12,490
Uh, sexually satisfied,
philosophically trying.

117
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:15,533
- Rubbish.
- There's a question here on the right.

118
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,568
I read in one of the papers
that you'll be giving...

119
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,571
a free concert in San Francisco.

120
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,903
We are doing a free concert
in San Francisco.

121
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:26,067
- When?
- On December 6.

122
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:30,272
And, uh, the location is not
Golden Gate Park, unfortunately,

123
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:33,338
but it's somewhere adjacent
to it which is a bit larger.

124
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:38,580
It's creating sort of
a microcosmic society, you know,

125
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:41,417
which sets the example
to the rest ofAmerica...

126
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:44,583
as to how one can behave
in large gatherings.

127
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:47,787
This is Mel Belli,
the lawyer in San Francisco.

128
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:52,025
Uh, I'm-I'm talking
for the Rolling Stones.

129
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:55,830
We've got their managers
and their principals here.

130
00:16:55,902 --> 00:16:59,928
I've just heard that you've
offered them your speedway...

131
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:03,567
for their performance
on Saturday, is that right?

132
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:06,804
- That is correct.
- This is an open phone
so we can all talk on it.

133
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:11,975
What I'm trying to find out
is what we can do to do this concert.

134
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,610
For the last 36 hours, I've stood
my organization on its ear, Mr. Belli.

135
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:20,146
I don't know anything about this.
I'm coming in late and trying
to straighten something out.

136
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:22,714
So tell me exactly
what it is without--

137
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:27,491
Yeah. My first area
of policy concern:

138
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:31,362
I do not want this gesture...

139
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,698
on the part of Mr. Jagger...

140
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,932
to cost me five cents.

141
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:41,202
If a blade of grass is torn down,

142
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:44,903
they are going
to build it up again, you know?

143
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:48,004
I was involved in Woodstock.

144
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:51,517
I've represented rock groups,
and I've been involved,

145
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:56,850
both as an attorney and
as an executive, with festivals.

146
00:17:56,922 --> 00:18:00,289
No matter what anybody tells
you, they're a pain in the ass.

147
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,792
Don't turn me into a proctologist.

148
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,328
Just tell me what I can do here.

149
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:09,331
Well, somebody tell me why I should
want to get this concert going.

150
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,334
Are you trying to make it
so they can't do this?

151
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:17,202
No, I want it to happen,
but I'm not prepared to rebuild
my goddamn racetrack.

152
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:20,674
Will you come up and see
if you can work with me on this thing?

153
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:24,508
I'd love to work with you, Mr. Belli,
but are you working with Mr. Jagger?

154
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,377
I haven't met Mr. Jagger.
I've only met these other people here.

155
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:31,215
- Have you met Mr. Schneider?
- Yes, he's right here in the office.

156
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:34,618
All right, fine.
He knows what happened
at our meeting this afternoon.

157
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:36,656
Then call me back
and with the thought...

158
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,021
see if you could come up
tomorrow morning.

159
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:42,528
- You and I can see what we
can do with this damn thing.
- Okay.

160
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,529
All right, call me back.

161
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:47,691
There's no way to do the concert
except in that location.

162
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:51,862
As it stands now, you're gonna have
at least 100,000 kids there by Saturday.

163
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:55,236
You don 't have any alternative.
The only thing you can do...

164
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:58,969
is to do an affidavit,
temporary restraining order
and talk to one of the judges.

165
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:01,341
So that brings us down to this.

166
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:05,040
Um, I'll call one
of the judges right now.

167
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:08,516
That's your only chance of
forcing these people to do it.

168
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:11,383
Now, don't scare off from these people.

169
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:14,513
If I were advising them,
I'd tell them to hide out.

170
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,529
Because right when they're coming out,
you'll-- sh-ta-boom!

171
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:13,597
- Yeah, but it doesn't
come in till the solo.
- I know, I know.

172
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:18,103
- What is that?
- What?

173
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,444
- Stickin' out of your pocket.
- Cousin Minnie says,

174
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:24,143
"How delicious!"

175
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:29,978
I'm taking it home for Robert.

176
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,523
Y'all come back now, ya hear?

177
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:34,957
That's one more song.

178
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:41,722
That should be it.
I found it. I found it.

179
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,452
Anybody in?
Is my local groupie in?

180
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,623
Hello, darling.
How are you?

181
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,660
When are the bags
coming up, Ronnie?

182
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,862
Stew's gotta get 46 pieces up.

183
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:37,620
We're gonna do--

184
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:40,751
We're gonna do a slow blues
for you now, people.

185
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:57,351
You like that?
I like it.

186
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,826
This thing is going on.
The Chronicle is coming out
with a story that it's off.

187
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:11,625
- This has been building up
for a long time.
- Well, it's off and on.

188
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:14,667
Everybody wants a piece of the pie.

189
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,497
All right, let's see
if we can get some facts...

190
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:20,333
to build together
on an affidavit here.

191
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:24,465
So we'll have that available and then
a very short order to show cause.

192
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:27,636
The sheriff wants to know who's going
to go to the bathroom and where.

193
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:30,806
They've got a nice little
bucolic community there--

194
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,781
They know practically when
every john is flushed...

195
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,014
and the orderly habits of the bathroom
of all of their, uh, voters.

196
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,180
Dick Carter's on the line.

197
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,655
He's offering us
the speedway at Altamont.

198
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:45,717
Hello, Dick.
This is Mel Belli for the Stones.

199
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:49,024
If they were to perform
in the speedway,

200
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:53,124
is the speedway open
so that they can be seen...

201
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:55,691
from the people that can't get in?

202
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,636
I'm sure we can work something out.
I want the publicity.

203
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:02,835
You want the publicity?
Well, you take the publicity.

204
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:06,002
The Rolling Stones don't want any money.
It's for charity.

205
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:08,342
- So I'll take the money.
- All right.

206
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:10,780
All right.
Well, why don't I do this?

207
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,409
Why don't I talk
with these people here...

208
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:15,680
and then I'll get back with you...

209
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:18,018
and then if we
have to sign anything up...

210
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:21,182
and if you need any insurance,
which I'm sure you will want,

211
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:25,194
and all the rest of that stuff,
I'll work with you in the morning.

212
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:28,924
- Okay.
- I'll call you back later,
after I talk with them, Dick.

213
00:31:28,998 --> 00:31:32,934
Bye. He's offered
the Altamont Speedway.

214
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:35,469
- There's not enough room.
- There's not time to move it.

215
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:38,233
We got to tear down
a stage and the scaffolding.

216
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:42,402
The phones are in. The generators
are there. Everything is left to go.

217
00:31:42,477 --> 00:31:46,242
It's anticipated that the amount of kids
now traveling across country--

218
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:49,578
you may have anywhere
from 5,000 to 20,000 kids...

219
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,174
starting to arrive sometime tomorrow.

220
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:56,052
They're all lining up at the airports
from as far away as New York.

221
00:31:56,122 --> 00:32:00,182
- Now? You gotta be kidding.
- You have no idea what goes on here.

222
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:03,751
It's an amazing phenomenon.
It's like the lemmings of the sea.

223
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:06,423
- Mike Lang is on the line.
- Yeah, Mike?

224
00:32:06,498 --> 00:32:10,729
John says that he doesn't think
you can make it overthere
at the Altamont Speedway.

225
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:13,236
- Do you want to talk directly to Mike?
- Yeah.

226
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:17,740
Mike, I got the impression
from everybody where you are...

227
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:20,641
that there was no way
of moving to that speedway.

228
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,338
We can do it.
Nobody wants to,
but if we have to, we can.

229
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:28,349
Just a quick question.
You were at Woodstock, and
you've now been to Altamont?

230
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:31,351
- Right.
- How does it stack up?
Do you have the room?

231
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:34,752
I think we have the room, sure.
I think we can hold as many
people as want to come.

232
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:37,257
Can you change locations that fast?

233
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:41,317
We had a much bigger
operation to change at Woodstock.
I don't think we'll have much problem.

234
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:45,126
We're just dealing with a free concert.
That's what we want to present.

235
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:49,100
And I think that's what the Stones
are up to. They want to play here.

236
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,363
Is this going to be Woodstock West?

237
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,997
Well, it's going to be San Francisco.

238
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:58,600
Do you have any special feelings
about this kind of a concert?
This spontaneous, free--

239
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:02,078
Well, it's not so much--
I don't think it's a complete concert.

240
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,081
The concert is just--
I think it's an excuse.

241
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,845
You know, because,
like, the thing is,

242
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:10,785
it's just like everyone coming
and having a good time.

243
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,618
The concert's like
the proscenium of a theater.

244
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,921
It's like an excuse for everyone to just
sort of, you know, get together...

245
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:20,257
and, like, talk to each other
and sleep with each other...

246
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:22,991
ball each other
and get very stoned...

247
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:26,728
and just have a nice night out
and a good day, you know?

248
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:29,599
- I mean, do you understand?
- I do.

249
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,605
It's not just like getting
up there and seeing...

250
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:37,507
the Grateful Airplane
and the Rolling, Rolling Dead.

251
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:44,305
And now, Ike and Tina Turner.

252
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:47,181
Thank you.

253
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:44,964
I don't know what they paid
for them-- the costumes--

254
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:47,903
but is there any way--

255
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,850
Good. It's nice to have
a chick occasionally.

256
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,781
Far out.

257
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,910
Sorry you had to wait.

258
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:39,477
Whoo!

259
00:40:39,546 --> 00:40:44,074
Oh, yeah!
Thank you kindly.

260
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:47,712
I think I busted a button
on my trousers.

261
00:40:47,786 --> 00:40:50,277
Hope they don't fall down.

262
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:56,357
It's that jumping around.
I'll have to do it up again.

263
00:40:56,427 --> 00:41:01,490
Whoo! You don't want my trousers
to fall down now, do you?

264
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:13,135
We're gonna--
We're gonna kiss you good-bye.

265
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:18,040
And we leave you
to kiss each other good-bye.

266
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:22,840
- Hello?
- Yes, Mel?

267
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:26,148
- Yes, we still have you.
- I got you in an echo.
Think you can pick it up?

268
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:30,020
I'm practicing. I'm going on first
before the Rolling Stones.

269
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,957
Can we get you to pick up
the phone like before?

270
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:37,486
Well, what it is now, we're waiting
for Mr. Carter to come in.

271
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:40,589
But I've just had
a letter read to me...

272
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,260
where he said
that he very definitely...

273
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,633
wants the Stones
and the concert there.

274
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:50,334
So, as of this minute, we're
intending that the show go on.

275
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:53,605
They have 200,
300 people working...

276
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:58,512
and it's going to be
quite a problem to get the thing
set up at the Altamont Speedway.

277
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:01,209
But it will be,
and it will start at 10:00.

278
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:04,219
Now, that's where we stand.
I'm waiting for Mr. Carter now.

279
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:08,313
Uh, let me ask and see.
Are the Rolling Stones all in town?

280
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,484
- Not yet. They're coming tonight.
- They're coming in tonight.

281
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,790
But everybody's ready,
and they're all set to go.

282
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:18,958
That's where we are.
Is this Mr. Carter?

283
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:22,230
Sheriff, Mr. Carter just came in.

284
00:42:22,303 --> 00:42:24,793
Now, could we talk a little bit?

285
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:28,671
I can put this on the box
so that we can all hear.

286
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:32,006
And I think, to start,
Mr. Carter has expressed...

287
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:37,243
his willingness to have this
on his private property over there.

288
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:42,150
But the question is of this
narrow road to come in there.

289
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,654
Do you foresee
any problems on that?

290
00:42:44,723 --> 00:42:49,659
Well, that basically is
the Highway Patrol's problem,
and they foresee problems.

291
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,686
How many cars can Mr. Carter
park on his property?

292
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:57,699
150 cars per acre?
150 cars per acre times 80 acres.

293
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,895
- How many?
- 150 times 80.

294
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:03,961
- 12,000.
- 12,000 automobiles.

295
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:08,032
Well, up in Tallalamee County,
they estimated they had 80,000 cars.

296
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,044
What are we
going to do with them?

297
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:13,307
There's much open area
around there.

298
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:15,645
I can probably arrange
with other landowners.

299
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:18,150
There's one adjoining me
that has 2,000 acres.

300
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:22,552
Yes, well, we have
some of the adjoining landowners
complaining before it's even granted.

301
00:43:22,622 --> 00:43:27,854
If there's 50,000 cars that Mr. Carter
can 't park, we're in trouble.

302
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:23,065
8:38 now at KFRC.
This is Frank Terry, and let me repeat:

303
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:28,544
The Rolling Stones'
free concert is going to be on
tomorrow at Altamont Speedway.

304
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:32,342
Apparently, it's one of the most
difficult things to give a free concert.

305
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:36,112
As you all know, the concert
was originally scheduled
for Golden Gate Park...

306
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,948
and then
at the Sears Point Raceway.

307
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,853
Many, many volunteers
went out to Sears Point...

308
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:45,120
in trucks, cars, trailers,
everything,

309
00:44:45,193 --> 00:44:48,593
packed up all the gear out there
and took it to the Altamont Speedway...

310
00:44:48,662 --> 00:44:51,597
where they are right now,
in the cold, 30-degree weather,

311
00:44:51,665 --> 00:44:54,497
setting up the stage,
setting up the generators...

312
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,661
the sound equipment
and the facilities for the people.

313
00:45:59,391 --> 00:46:02,258
We're gonna end it now.
Good-bye.

314
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,532
Yeah!

315
00:46:46,066 --> 00:46:49,034
Well, all right!
We got to go!

316
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:52,468
We got to go!
We got to go!

317
00:46:52,538 --> 00:46:54,664
We got to go!

318
00:48:17,912 --> 00:48:20,574
They hit Mick. Somebody hit him.

319
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,310
- Come on over.
- I hate you!

320
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:54,637
Keith!
Do you think he'll be coming out?

321
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,578
Oh, Mickey, Mickey,
Mickey, Mickey.

322
00:49:06,788 --> 00:49:10,553
I can't function. I've been
on the scaffolding almost all night.

323
00:49:10,624 --> 00:49:15,118
I can't close my hands. They're formed
to the shape of the scaffolding.

324
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:17,925
You people that are hanging
on that scaffolding,

325
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:22,161
you're rendering that scaffold
unsafe by climbing on it.

326
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:26,102
Those scaffoldings are not built
to take very heavy weight.

327
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,197
So if we could have
some sort of reason,

328
00:49:29,274 --> 00:49:32,505
whatever that might be,
we'd be very pleased.

329
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:36,536
Arthur, in between moving
around, always turn that off.

330
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:40,914
Turn it off and turn it on.
Look, you've got to be very cool
with that little thing.

331
00:49:40,985 --> 00:49:44,579
Even though it's supposed to be
electrically correct, man,

332
00:49:44,654 --> 00:49:46,918
you got to really
think right around it.

333
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:51,550
Are you gonna hear
some music today?

334
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:55,620
Hey, you want me to just
leave this in here?

335
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:58,359
No.

336
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:05,038
Hashish.

337
00:50:10,544 --> 00:50:12,842
Hashish.

338
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:15,813
L.S.D.

339
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:17,815
Psilocybin.

340
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:22,144
Hashish.

341
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:29,323
Make them comfortable.
Even this parking situation back here,

342
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,657
it's all wrong, but
that's the way the kids park.

343
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,959
For once, we're just
gonna let it happen.

344
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,158
For experimental purposes.
You know what I mean?

345
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,894
So be as easy on this
as we can.

346
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:42,495
It won't hurt the Stones
in any way.

347
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:49,839
Wow!

348
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:54,643
Wow, but I wanna be smart,
but you're just so far out.

349
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:03,949
Because... yeah!

350
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:21,604
They should be back when they
discover we're not with them.

351
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:25,234
Since we've got the beer
and the food, they'll find us.

352
00:51:37,787 --> 00:51:41,314
Well, a guy's freaking out
over at the tent there--

353
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,983
So, tough shit.

354
00:51:46,861 --> 00:51:50,455
What do you mean, tough shit?
The guy's really freaking out.

355
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:52,465
Keep-Keep your--

356
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:55,468
No, I don't mean tough shit.
What I mean is that...

357
00:51:55,536 --> 00:51:59,335
if you lay successive
numbers of bums on this crowd,

358
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:03,739
by the time 6:00 comes around,
they're gonna be in a real mood.

359
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:09,111
I'm not prepared to stand
here laying bum trips--

360
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:14,015
Up at Woodstock this was done,
and you were there, and you know.

361
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:16,019
And announcements were made.

362
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,758
We're just sort of
getting there, basically.

363
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:30,424
If we make it.

364
00:52:30,499 --> 00:52:33,957
I've been falling a lot lately.

365
00:52:34,036 --> 00:52:37,403
Let's go this way.
Whoa! When did this happen?

366
00:52:37,473 --> 00:52:41,238
There's already a doctor over there.
A chick's having a baby.

367
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:43,243
She's having a baby.

368
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:46,302
Contributions
to Panther Defense Fund.

369
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:52,507
Contributions
to the Panther Defense Fund.

370
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,520
They're trying to either
wipe out the Panther party...

371
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:59,490
by jailing all the members
and wiping them out economically,

372
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:03,118
financially, or violently
through killing them.

373
00:53:05,196 --> 00:53:08,290
After all, they're just--
they're just Negroes, you know?

374
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:13,960
Need that cannon pretty bad.

375
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:31,614
We just had our first baby born
at Carter's Altamont Speedway.

376
00:53:31,686 --> 00:53:34,711
Yeah, right, yes.

377
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:37,986
- Just had our first baby born.
- Oh, wow.

378
00:53:38,058 --> 00:53:40,424
Okay so far.
Everything's all right.

379
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:44,054
- We have a helicopter standing by.
- Can we get a mike?

380
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,930
If the press will push this:
Dick Carter's Altamont Speedway,
not just Altamont Speedway.

381
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,764
This cat right over here.
He just told me to do it, man.

382
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,862
No, well, I'm sorry.
Nobody else goes there except me.

383
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,965
I'd really like you to get off
the stage, baby, please.

384
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,975
Okay, well, I can dig that.

385
00:53:59,043 --> 00:54:01,238
- Thanks very much.
- Uh-huh.

386
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:12,787
The American Red Cross has asked
us to secure these supplies.

387
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:16,188
If anyone has any
of these things to contribute.

388
00:54:16,258 --> 00:54:18,488
We need Ace bandages.

389
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:22,997
Ace bandages,
gauze and sponges.

390
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:26,898
If you have any of that equipment,
please bring it to the medical tent...

391
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:31,131
or to the Golden Gate Chapter
Disaster Service Red Cross truck.

392
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:33,332
Excuse me.
Which way is the stage?

393
00:54:33,407 --> 00:54:36,342
Around the corner?
You mean that way?

394
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,401
I think we're in pretty good
shape, though, right now.

395
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:42,573
We're in chaos backstage.
We'll never get--

396
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:45,980
That's gonna have to be cleared,
'cause the group's gotta come in.

397
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:49,817
What we need to do is start
getting some blokes together--

398
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:52,755
The essence of it,
as far as I'm concerned,
is this is where the work has gotta go.

399
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:56,418
- Right.
- Sling them all out.

400
00:54:56,494 --> 00:55:02,329
No fucking about. We've had enough
of being polite. Get out, go away.

401
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:05,799
- I've asked. I know.
- So if you could help us,
that would be groovy.

402
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,997
- Sure.
- All these people, you know?

403
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:13,565
I want to see Mick Jagger,
goddamn it. No!

404
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:16,577
Can I say just one thing
before you take her off?

405
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:19,169
- Just let me say one thing.
- I will not!

406
00:55:21,582 --> 00:55:24,983
Hey, before you go away, man.

407
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:27,679
Don't tell me what to say, okay?

408
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:31,019
You look after your job, baby,
and I'll look after mine.

409
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:34,526
You're trying to stop me.
I'm trying to ask you--

410
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:39,587
Will you ask all these
people that are milling around
if they'd move to the side, man.

411
00:56:05,254 --> 00:56:07,721
He wants to listen to you.

412
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:11,122
- You want a bong?
- She wants to get fucked.

413
00:56:11,192 --> 00:56:13,682
That's the way!

414
00:56:19,934 --> 00:56:22,902
You don't belong here, man.

415
00:56:32,377 --> 00:56:35,312
- Let me have some of that.
- I wanna get up on stage.

416
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,507
The organizers,
who number about 20 people,

417
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:42,713
would really like
to thank the hundreds of people
who came out here last night...

418
00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:45,380
and worked all night to get this on.

419
00:56:45,455 --> 00:56:47,821
Thanks to everybody who helped.

420
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:51,258
And I'd like to point out
to everybody here...

421
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:55,889
that this can be the greatest
party of 1969 that we've had.

422
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:01,630
Let's have a party,
and let's have a good time.

423
00:57:01,703 --> 00:57:04,263
The Flying Burrito Brothers!

424
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:39,703
Please stop hurting each other.
Please stop hurting each other.

425
00:59:39,775 --> 00:59:43,676
You don't have to.

426
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:47,306
Take him out the other side!

427
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:51,850
Take him out the other side!

428
00:59:54,187 --> 00:59:57,314
Hey, man, quit crowding.
Just back off.

429
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:01,553
We need a doctor under
the left-hand scaffold...

430
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:04,152
as soon as possible, please.

431
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:07,289
They're not gonna play music
till we get a doctor.

432
01:00:07,365 --> 01:00:09,799
Somebody help.

433
01:00:11,169 --> 01:00:13,261
Somebody's hurt!

434
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:35,953
Marianne Faithfull is here.

435
01:00:40,427 --> 01:00:43,692
You feel like signing a few albums?

436
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:46,857
Let me have that album.
Where's that album?

437
01:00:50,804 --> 01:00:52,738
Thank you.

438
01:00:54,072 --> 01:00:56,404
Well, I'm not stepping outside.

439
01:00:56,475 --> 01:00:59,638
- I don't blame you.
- I am. I want to.

440
01:00:59,711 --> 01:01:02,304
-Just sign this.
- But I can't get very far.

441
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,814
Sign this, please.
Sign this one too.

442
01:01:04,882 --> 01:01:09,648
Hey, what about the free records
and all the rest of the shit?

443
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:15,021
There are a number of people
on and around this stage
who should not be here.

444
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:20,027
Consequently-- Consequently,
the musicians on this stage...

445
01:01:20,095 --> 01:01:25,498
are playing with something like
200 people breathing down their necks.

446
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:28,593
Now, can I please ask that
everyone leaves the stage...

447
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,902
and, as I say, we'll go back to
playing music and nothing else.

448
01:01:34,408 --> 01:01:37,571
The Jefferson Airplane.
Jefferson Airplane.

449
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:37,867
Easy!

450
01:04:44,174 --> 01:04:46,107
Easy!

451
01:04:49,812 --> 01:04:52,406
Easy.

452
01:04:52,482 --> 01:04:55,917
Easy. Easy.

453
01:04:55,984 --> 01:04:59,886
Easy. Easy.

454
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,574
Easy.

455
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:28,241
Please be quiet.

456
01:05:28,312 --> 01:05:31,042
Please be quiet.

457
01:05:31,115 --> 01:05:33,981
Please be quiet.

458
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:37,987
Please be quiet.

459
01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:51,388
Yeah, it's all right.
It's kind of weird up here.

460
01:05:51,466 --> 01:05:54,435
Hey, man, I'd like to mention
that the Hell's Angels...

461
01:05:54,502 --> 01:05:57,800
just smashed Marty Balin in the face
and knocked him out for a bit.

462
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,431
I'd like to thank you for that.

463
01:06:00,507 --> 01:06:02,702
There's other ways--

464
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:05,335
Hey, wait. Is this on?

465
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:09,108
- You're talkin' to me,
I'm gonna talk to you.
- I'm not talking to you.

466
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:12,639
You're talking to my people.
Let me tell you what's happenin'.

467
01:06:12,717 --> 01:06:15,880
You is what happenin'!

468
01:06:15,954 --> 01:06:18,684
Hey! Oh!

469
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:22,692
- No! No!
- Watch it. Hold it.

470
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:29,589
- No, stop it!
- You know what's happening?

471
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,692
- What's happening?
- We're partying like you.

472
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:35,863
No! No!

473
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:41,774
Um, you know,
that's really stupid.

474
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:45,472
Hey, man, you guys
don't have to stay on the stage.
They're not gonna hassle us.

475
01:06:45,546 --> 01:06:48,379
- Hey.
- They're not really that--
That's really not worth it.

476
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:51,145
You don't hassle
with anybody in particular.

477
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:55,552
You gotta keep your bodies
off each other unless you intend love.

478
01:06:55,622 --> 01:07:00,321
People get weird, and you need people
like the Angels to keep people in line.

479
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:04,624
But the Angels also--
You know, you don't bust
people in the head for nothing.

480
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:08,894
So both sides are, uh,
fucking up temporarily.

481
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:11,959
Let's not keep fuckin' up!

482
01:07:23,514 --> 01:07:26,311
- Oh, that's what the story is here?
- Yeah.

483
01:07:26,382 --> 01:07:29,249
- Oh, bummer.
- Really bad. I mean, like, it's scary.

484
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:31,582
- Who's doing all the beating?
- Hell's Angels.

485
01:07:31,654 --> 01:07:34,781
- Hell's Angels
are beating on musicians?
- Marty got beat up.

486
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:37,154
- A fight on the stage.
- Doesn't seem right, man.

487
01:07:37,225 --> 01:07:39,455
It's really weird, man.
It's really weird.

488
01:07:39,528 --> 01:07:42,325
- Oh, man! Really?
- There's lots of people.

489
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:48,928
Get that cleared!

490
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:51,197
Let's get it!

491
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:48,916
Oh, babies.

492
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:53,952
There's so many of you.

493
01:08:54,025 --> 01:08:57,654
Just be cool down in front
and don't push around.

494
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:02,866
Just keep still.
Keep together.

495
01:09:05,402 --> 01:09:07,336
Oh, yeah.

496
01:10:07,356 --> 01:10:10,348
Hey! Hey!

497
01:10:17,232 --> 01:10:20,758
Hey, Keith, Keith, Keith!

498
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:23,394
Keith, will you cool it,
and I'll try and stop it.

499
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:27,531
Hey, hey, people.

500
01:10:27,608 --> 01:10:30,838
Sisters.
Brothers and sisters.

501
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:36,575
Brothers and sisters, come on now.

502
01:10:36,648 --> 01:10:40,277
That means everybody just cool out!

503
01:10:41,953 --> 01:10:45,217
Will you cool out, everybody?

504
01:10:45,289 --> 01:10:48,315
- A fight broke out.
- I know. I'm hip.

505
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,952
Everybody be cool now.
Come on.

506
01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:57,966
All right?

507
01:10:58,034 --> 01:11:01,799
How are we doing over there?
All right?

508
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,668
Can we still make it
down the front?

509
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:08,436
Is there anyone there
that's hurt? Huh?

510
01:11:08,509 --> 01:11:11,103
Everyone all right?
Okay?

511
01:11:12,947 --> 01:11:17,315
All right, I think we are cool.
We can do--

512
01:11:17,384 --> 01:11:21,912
We're always having--
Something very funny happens
when we start that number.

513
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,672
I need to get down with it now.

514
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:17,431
All right!

515
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:26,139
Uh, people, who's fighting, what for?

516
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:31,699
Who's fighting, and what for?

517
01:17:31,778 --> 01:17:37,444
Why are we fighting?
Why are we fighting?

518
01:17:37,517 --> 01:17:42,010
We don't want to fight.
Come on!

519
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:44,487
Do we want--
Who wants to fight?

520
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:46,490
Who is it?

521
01:17:50,194 --> 01:17:53,095
Hey, you know, I mean--

522
01:17:53,164 --> 01:17:56,030
Every other scene
has been cool. Let--

523
01:17:56,099 --> 01:18:00,297
Look, that guy there,
if he doesn't stop it, man--

524
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:05,695
Listen, either those cats
cool it, or we don't play.

525
01:18:05,774 --> 01:18:07,742
- Come on.
- You gonna stop?

526
01:18:09,845 --> 01:18:11,778
We need a doctor!

527
01:18:11,846 --> 01:18:14,440
If you don't cool it,
you ain't gonna hear no music!

528
01:18:14,515 --> 01:18:17,313
Now, you wanna all
go home or what?

529
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:22,247
We need doctors
down here now, please.

530
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:25,155
Can we have a doctor
down here now to the front?

531
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:34,959
I-I cannot see what's going on.
I just know that every time...

532
01:18:35,034 --> 01:18:37,467
we get to a number,
something happens.

533
01:18:37,535 --> 01:18:40,003
I don't know what's
going on, who's doing what.

534
01:18:40,071 --> 01:18:42,938
It's just a scuffle.
All I can ask you,

535
01:18:43,007 --> 01:18:46,100
San Francisco,
is like the whole thing.

536
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:49,942
Like, this could be
the most beautiful evening...

537
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:54,039
we've had for this winter,
you know, and we've really--

538
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:58,019
Why don't-- Don't fuck it up, man.
Come on, let's get it together.

539
01:18:58,087 --> 01:19:00,782
I can't do any more
than just ask you,

540
01:19:00,856 --> 01:19:03,450
beg you, just
to keep it together.

541
01:19:03,525 --> 01:19:06,426
You can do it.
It's within your power.

542
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,895
Everyone, Hell's Angels, everybody,

543
01:19:09,964 --> 01:19:13,058
let's just keep ourselves together.

544
01:19:15,202 --> 01:19:19,137
You know, if we are all one,
let's show we're all one.

545
01:19:21,407 --> 01:19:25,001
- Preach it, brother!
- Up on the scaffold. Urgently, man.

546
01:19:25,077 --> 01:19:27,307
There's one thing
horrible that we need.

547
01:19:27,379 --> 01:19:30,212
Sam, we need an ambulance.

548
01:19:30,282 --> 01:19:32,841
We need a doctor
by that scaffold there.

549
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:35,818
If there's a doctor,
can he get to there?

550
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:39,481
Okay, here we go. We're gonna--
I don't know what we're doing.

551
01:19:39,556 --> 01:19:43,390
When we get to really the end
and we all want to go absolutely crazy,

552
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:46,657
and, like,jump on each other,
then we'll stand up again.

553
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:49,425
You know what I mean?
Everyone keep-- sit down.

554
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:51,898
I mean, just keep cool,
and let's just relax.

555
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:55,868
Let's just get into the groove.
Come on, we can get it together.

556
01:19:55,937 --> 01:19:58,405
Come on. Sit down.

557
01:23:34,628 --> 01:23:37,722
Hey, man, look. We're splitting.
If those cats can't--

558
01:23:37,798 --> 01:23:42,598
If you people-- We're splitting
if those cats don't stop beating
everybody up in sight.

559
01:23:42,669 --> 01:23:47,038
I want them out of the way, man.
I don't like you--

560
01:23:47,107 --> 01:23:50,007
A guy's got a gun out here,
and he's shooting at the stage.

561
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:52,270
- It's one guy.
- He's got a gun.

562
01:23:52,344 --> 01:23:54,938
Hey, people.
Hey, people.

563
01:23:55,014 --> 01:23:57,311
Come on, let's be cool.

564
01:23:57,382 --> 01:23:59,942
People, please.

565
01:24:00,018 --> 01:24:04,113
There's no reason to hassle anybody.
Please don't permit it.

566
01:24:04,187 --> 01:24:09,682
If you move back and sit down,
we can continue and we will continue.

567
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,693
Can you roll back
on that, David?

568
01:24:11,761 --> 01:24:13,695
Sure.

569
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:34,572
Did you see
what was happening there?

570
01:24:34,648 --> 01:24:37,844
No, you couldn't see anything.
Well, it was another scuffle.

571
01:24:37,917 --> 01:24:40,977
There's the Angel
right there, with a knife.

572
01:24:43,522 --> 01:24:45,615
- Where's the gun?
- I'll roll it back.

573
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:48,454
You'll see it against
the girl's crocheted dress.

574
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:51,927
Right there, isn't it?

575
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:07,703
Oh, it's so horrible.

576
01:25:15,149 --> 01:25:18,084
Is there an officer?
Is there a policeman here?

577
01:25:18,152 --> 01:25:21,144
- What happened here, anyway?
- Man, he pulled out a gun.

578
01:25:21,222 --> 01:25:24,384
- He did?
- Yes, the Hell's Angels
took the gun away from him.

579
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:27,052
One of them has it now.
He showed it to me.

580
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:30,062
And they proceeded to put him down
on the ground and started kicking him.

581
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,326
And he has a couple of stab wounds
in his back and one over his ear.

582
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:37,335
We tried to keep him alive,
but when we got here, the doctor
checked him out and that was it.

583
01:25:37,403 --> 01:25:40,337
We pronounced him dead at about 6:20.

584
01:25:40,405 --> 01:25:44,136
We have a request from the state police.

585
01:25:44,209 --> 01:25:49,145
- I don't want him to die!
Don't let him die, please!
- He won't die!

586
01:25:49,213 --> 01:25:53,081
Now, they're gonna do
everything in their power.

587
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:56,778
- But they can't hear his heart.
- Now, don't worry about it.

588
01:25:56,853 --> 01:25:59,651
Don't worry about it.

589
01:25:59,722 --> 01:26:03,054
- They're gonna put him
in this whirlybird and take--
- I have to go with him.

590
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:05,457
Get back, please.

591
01:26:34,253 --> 01:26:36,186
Yeah!

592
01:26:40,324 --> 01:26:43,417
Whoo!
Bye, bye, bye, bye!

593
01:26:43,493 --> 01:26:47,327
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Oh, yeah!

594
01:27:01,442 --> 01:27:03,376
Come on in!

595
01:28:00,194 --> 01:28:04,129
All right.

596
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:06,722
See you all.

597
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,734
All right.
