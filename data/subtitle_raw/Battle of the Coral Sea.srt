1
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,939
Down scope.

2
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,984
See any more of those
Japanese fly-boys, Skipper?

3
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,243
No. But, we will.

4
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,953
They've got this Philippine
Coast pretty well covered.

5
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,246
How are our passengers, Len?

6
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,814
Closer than kissin' cousins.

7
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,350
The Army isn't used
to such tight quarters.

8
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,483
Beats Corregidor?

9
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,052
Yeah.
They aren't complaining.

10
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,306
It's just that a couple of
the higher brass isn't used

11
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,590
to such close proximity
to the enlisted man.

12
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm sure they don't mind
the enlisted man.

13
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,628
Aye-aye, sir.

14
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,364
Up scope.

15
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,141
Len, take a look.
Okay.

16
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,749
Must be off an American ship.

17
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,527
I hope there's another one
around to pick them up.

18
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,552
There is.
Where?

19
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,786
Here.

20
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,255
Down scope.

21
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,732
Prepare to surface.
All right, sir.

22
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,691
Skipper. Those fly-boys
might be back any minute.

23
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,068
We wouldn't stand
a prayer against them.

24
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,494
Neither would
the men in that raft.

25
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,539
Well, this is just plain suicide.
We're gonna surface.

26
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:20,100
Relax, Len. You never know,
there might be some nurses on that raft.

27
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,554
Enemy aircraft bearing 165,
Position angle three, sir!

28
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,660
Clear the decks!
Get those men below!

29
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,274
Dive! Dive!

30
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,799
That was a pretty close call.

31
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,302
Yeah, we've been having our
share of them here lately.

32
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,905
It's not the first for you
though, Major?

33
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,710
Skipper, the General would like
to know our exact time of arrival.

34
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,713
Yeah? Well, would you
inform the General

35
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,683
that our timetable hasn't
been too exact here lately,

36
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,520
but, our estimated time of arrival
is about two-and-a-half days.

37
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,415
Lieutenant, it just seems to me

38
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:50,150
that if the Navy would've
wanted a periscope camera,

39
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,185
why, they would have
invented one long ago.

40
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,097
Well, Franklin, you didn't
enjoy the distinction

41
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,824
of serving in the peacetime
Navy, like I did.

42
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,961
In those days, the Navy had all the
time in the world, but no money.

43
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,096
Now, they've got all the
money, but no time.

44
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,166
Say that again.

45
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:11,238
With this baby, you can scour
airstrips, shipping... Anything.

46
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,941
And prove that you saw it all.

47
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:20,848
Problem, Bates?

48
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,050
Well, no, sir.
I mean, yes, sir.

49
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,052
I mean, it can wait, sir.

50
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:29,022
It must be something terribly important.
What is it?

51
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,259
Well... No, I'd rather not now, sir.
You're busy...

52
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,827
Bates, what's your problem?

53
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,598
Well, sir, somebody hid
my bubble gum!

54
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,132
What again?

55
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,636
My whole supply.
And I got a sneakin' hunch who it is.

56
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,205
Halliday,
can you clear up this big mystery?

57
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,941
Yes, sir.
I hid it.

58
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,677
Why doesn't he
buy his own bubble gum?

59
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,278
Maybe you can explain this?

60
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,647
Begging your pardon, sir,
maybe Bates can explain this?

61
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:55,942
I tell you, this sub'll
never sink.

62
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,452
It's lined with
Bates' bubble gum.

63
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,654
Those charts are ready
on the bridge, Lieutenant.

64
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,889
Okay, thanks.

65
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,524
Halliday, you and Frank
come with me.

66
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,192
Bates, keep an eye
on that camera.

67
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,725
Aye, sir.
I'll watch it like a hawk.

68
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,667
Halliday will see you
get your bubble gum back.

69
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,274
If your mother knew the trouble this
caused, she'd never send it to you.

70
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,033
I think I'll send her a letter.

71
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,303
"Dear Mrs. Bates, will you kindly stop
sending your son that bubble gum?"

72
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,871
It's just a bunch of...

73
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,559
Wow, I think I've died
and gone to heaven.

74
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,295
Is something wrong?
Come here.

75
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,998
Give me a buck.
A dollar? What for?

76
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,968
If you don't like what you
see, you get your money back.

77
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,305
Whoa!

78
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,276
Come in.

79
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,815
Sit down, Conway.

80
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,154
I read your report.

81
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,657
You saved three men from
almost certain drowning.

82
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,992
My compliments.

83
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,627
Thank you, sir.

84
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,029
And in doing so,
you risked your entire crew,

85
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,366
a top Army General,
and a United States submarine!

86
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,002
I thought I had a fair chance
to save those men, sir.

87
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,503
Conway, under the circumstances,

88
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,037
any skipper in
the Submarine Service

89
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,740
would have done the same thing.

90
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,552
But when you're charged
with the responsibility

91
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,944
of carrying a Four-Star General
on a top priority mission,

92
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,413
you've got to
play it by the book.

93
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,584
This is a war we're having,
not fleet maneuvers off San Diego!

94
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,352
A fair chance isn't good enough.

95
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:41,822
I understand, sir.

96
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,524
I hope you do,
because I'm sending you on a mission

97
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,494
where there isn't any
leeway for mistakes.

98
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,996
Does that worry you?

99
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,464
Yes, sir.
Good.

100
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:58,839
These flags show the known enemy
bases, and naval installations.

101
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,842
There are a great many
others we don't know about.

102
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:07,547
Look how they're patterned, like a bow,
with the arrow going straight through here.

103
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,083
The Coral Sea?

104
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,585
Intelligence is positive.

105
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,756
Through the Coral Sea,
to New Guinea and Australia.

106
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,334
And we're badly outnumbered,
but we're going to put a task force

107
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,893
in front of them somehow.

108
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,297
If you're thinking that
you and the Dragonfish

109
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,367
are going to join this task
force right away, you're wrong.

110
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,503
I've got a more important
job for you to do first.

111
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,440
More important than...

112
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,144
Yes. A scouting mission to
locate the Japanese fleet.

113
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,980
We've got to have more data on
their strength and their positions.

114
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,514
Especially the carriers.

115
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,727
We'll be operating the radio
silence, Admiral. Right?

116
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,954
Yes. Any radio transmission between
the task force and the Dragonfish

117
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,122
will alert the Japanese.

118
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,791
When you accumulate your data,

119
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,926
you will rendezvous
with our ships,

120
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,362
give them the information
by blinker.

121
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,032
You leave here at 0400 tomorrow.

122
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:03,837
Your recognition signal and the rendezvous
point are in these sealed orders.

123
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,074
Open them on the eighth day,
proceed accordingly.

124
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,843
Now remember this.

125
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,847
If you have trouble,
any trouble,

126
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,917
your responsibility is
to those orders.

127
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,120
The Japanese must not know
our rendezvous point.

128
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,457
If you have to scuttle yourself and
sacrifice every man on board to prevent it,

129
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,194
you'll do it.

130
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,630
That's all.

131
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,334
Good luck.

132
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,569
Thank you.

133
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,241
Admiral, um,
my Executive Officer's been

134
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,376
working on a periscope camera.

135
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,847
He has confidence in it,
and he'd like your permission to use it.

136
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,783
Certainly. If it works,
it could be very valuable on this mission.

137
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,195
Keep the line moving!
Two bucks to see the thrill of your life.

138
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,954
Shorty said it only cost
him a dollar.

139
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,927
What's the matter? Didn't you ever
hear of the law of supply and demand?

140
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,564
Okay, Mac, that's all.
Next!

141
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,434
Come on, let's hurry up.
We got to go. Come on.

142
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,772
Come on, we've got a whole
crew behind us. Let's go.

143
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,673
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on.

144
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,243
Bates!
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,726
Mind if I have a look
through my camera?

146
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,251
No, no, sir.

147
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,020
No charge, sir.
I mean...

148
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:39,767
Here's my contribution to the
Recreation and Welfare Fund.

149
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,591
Len, take a look.

150
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,777
Do you stand behind
that camera of yours?

151
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,936
It'll work, Captain.
Go ahead.

152
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,722
That should do it, Captain.
Good.

153
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,826
Put this through the scope
and see what happens.

154
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,695
Come on.

155
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,843
Perfect.
Absolutely perfect.

156
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,311
What about that, Franklin?

157
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,914
I think Uncle Petrie
would be proud of you, sir.

158
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,449
Come on.

159
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,886
Carl who made this
coffee anyhow?

160
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,059
I don't know,
but it tastes like battery acid to me.

161
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,256
Here you go!

162
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,493
Beautiful, Len!
Beautiful, beautiful!

163
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,729
You know how important
this is, don't you, Len?

164
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,666
Sure. Now we can give
the Admiral a picture

165
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,136
of every Japanese coastal installation
from here to the rendezvous point.

166
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,617
Fancy Free.

167
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,087
Fancy Free.

168
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,908
- Len?
- Yeah?

169
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,977
Give me the carrier
identification book.

170
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,211
Okay.

171
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,747
It's nice.
What type?

172
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,082
Shoho, I think.

173
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,418
Here, take a look.

174
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:55,328
Yeah, here we are.
Shoho Class, 30,000 tons.

175
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,630
Holy, sweet suffering sukiyaki.

176
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:58,798
You can say that again.

177
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,668
Holy, sweet suffering sukiyaki.

178
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,136
Put down the scope.

179
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,085
You know what you were
looking at, don't you?

180
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,079
The whole carrier division of
the Imperial Japanese Navy.

181
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,214
Probably the Pearl Harbor boys.

182
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,083
Shall we call battle stations?

183
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,894
No. The only thing we're going to shoot
this trip is that camera of yours.

184
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,320
Well, I'll go get it.

185
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,289
No, we're not going in yet.

186
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,823
How come we don't
have to, Skipper?

187
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,768
I can get that whole rogues'
gallery right from here.

188
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,361
No. The only thing I want you
to do now is plot the positions

189
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,097
of those channel buoys.

190
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,599
Afterwards, we'll go out,
surface, charge our batteries,

191
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,834
come back for a closer
look in the morning.

192
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,313
But, Skipper, there might be
controlled mine fields in there.

193
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,207
Right. Yeah. And if we go
down below periscope depth,

194
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,751
well, those currents might send
us into one of those mine fields.

195
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,811
That's a chance we have to take.

196
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,880
What's the matter, Len,
didn't you ever hear of a close-up?

197
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,295
Captain? Captain?

198
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,563
It's 0400, sir.

199
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,843
Thanks, Chief. Tell the Conning
Officer I'll be right up.

200
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,036
Aye-aye, sir.

201
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,152
This is the Captain.
It is now 0415.

202
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,055
We're about to enter
a minefield.

203
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,923
I want every man
as quiet as possible

204
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:33,360
so we can get our information
and get out of here.

205
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,961
Rig ship for silent running.

206
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,202
All compartments rigged
for silent running.

207
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,020
Bring it up to five, eight feet.

208
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,179
Five, eight, nine.

209
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,152
Left ten degrees rudder.
All ahead, one third.

210
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,554
Left ten degrees rudder.
All ahead, one third.

211
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,095
All answer, I had one third.
Rudder is left ten. Very well.

212
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,634
That line of channel buoys
is dead ahead, sir.

213
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,503
Rudder amidships.
Steady as she goes.

214
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,439
Rudder amidships.
Steady and cars 250.

215
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,846
Sir, time to turn.
We cleared the first leg.

216
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,881
Make your course 270.

217
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,050
Right down the slot.
270.

218
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,160
Steady. 270.
Very well.

219
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,532
According to my plot,
we're almost out of the minefield.

220
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,082
We're through it.
Bring it up 60 feet.

221
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,217
Six-aye.

222
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,857
If I knew a prayer...

223
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,926
Never mind, boy,
I'll say an extra one for you.

224
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:18,998
Out scope.

225
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,858
Go to work now.

226
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,412
Got 'em all.

227
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,181
Down scope. Nine-feet.

228
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,316
Nine-of feet, aye.

229
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,085
Right full rudder.
All ahead full!

230
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,755
Right full rudder.
All ahead full!

231
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,811
It didn't go off.

232
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,682
It must be a controlled mine.

233
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,494
I think we've cleared
the mine field.

234
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,764
We're out of the channel.

235
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,200
Rudder to midships.

236
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,802
All stop!

237
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,804
Rudder to midships.

238
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,406
Engines all stop, sir.

239
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,539
Very well.

240
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,443
Ease her down and
set her on the bottom.

241
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,176
Set her on the bottom.
Aye, aye, Captain.

242
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,784
Rig for depth charge.
Torpedo Room, stand by.

243
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,022
We may have to use 'em yet.

244
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,182
Torpedo Room.

245
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,950
Having trouble
with that leak again.

246
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,684
Captain, Torpedo Room is having
trouble with that leak again, sir.

247
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:09,962
Report damage.

248
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,031
All departments report damage.

249
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,202
Main power's still out, sir.

250
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,371
Forward Torpedo Room flooding.

251
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,139
Rudder's jammed.

252
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,275
Leak in the Aft Torpedo
Room, but under control, sir.

253
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,378
One more pattern
will bust her hull.

254
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,049
They've stopped.

255
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:49,135
They're right on top of us.
Just sitting there.

256
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,041
Waiting for us to
make a break and run.

257
00:22:58,578 --> 00:22:59,946
So, we wait.

258
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,755
Twelve hours, sir.

259
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,525
The air's gonna start
to get foul.

260
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,796
Sir, that Aft Torpedo Room
is having trouble

261
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,465
with that leak again.

262
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,433
Very well.

263
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:23,803
What are they doing up there?

264
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,739
All right. All right.
Don't lose your bubble, kid.

265
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:46,025
Attention! There are two depth
charges fastened to your hull!

266
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,928
You have five minutes
to surrender!

267
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:53,733
But the Submarine Commander shall
remain onboard for inspection.

268
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,302
Knock it off!

269
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,870
Schechter, tap out an answer.

270
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,882
Tell 'em we got their message
and stand by for reply.

271
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,207
Len...
Aye-aye, sir.

272
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,110
Go down and get the burn basket
take it to the Ward Room.

273
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,960
Burn all that stuff too, Len.

274
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,797
You can't burn this.

275
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,399
This film will just poison the air.
It's foul enough already.

276
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:30,312
All right, we'll just have to take a
chance and blow it through the after tubes.

277
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,305
Put it in here.
Use that camera to weight it down.

278
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,044
This is the Captain speaking.

279
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,013
Have Bates and Connors report
to the Ward Room right away.

280
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:47,253
Remember, Len, don't do anything
till I give you the signal.

281
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:49,822
Jeff...

282
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,225
You mean, you're going
to surrender?

283
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,995
We're going to surrender,
not the ship.

284
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:03,302
Bates, can you build up enough impulse
pressure to fire those after tubes?

285
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:07,373
Yes, sir. But the tubes are in
bad shape after that last ash can.

286
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,975
I can't put a fish through it.

287
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:12,511
All right. Pull one out,
build up enough impulse pressure

288
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,880
to fire a water slug.

289
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,081
Aye, sir.

290
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,482
Connors.

291
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,117
Rig up a demolition charge

292
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,531
with the wire leading to a
manual detonator on the bridge.

293
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:21,654
Aye aye, sir.

294
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,490
Jeff...

295
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:27,894
We've only got their word that depth
charges are fastened to the hull.

296
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,361
I know.

297
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:32,264
We haven't got anything
left to fight with.

298
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,534
Hurry up, we haven't
got much time.

299
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,576
Schechter, tap out a message.

300
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,387
Tell 'em we're ready to
surface and surrender.

301
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,411
Aye-aye, sir.

302
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,513
Stand by to surface.

303
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,315
Stand by to surface, aye, sir.

304
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:52,051
Depth 142 feet.
Very well.

305
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,364
Demolition charges all rigged, sir.
Okay, chief.

306
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,537
Aft Torpedo Room.
Tell Lieutenant Ross to stand by.

307
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,140
Standing by, sir.

308
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:17,176
I hope we've got enough
pressure to clear the tube, sir.

309
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,711
So do I.

310
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:21,547
The air man a full rig?
The air man a full rig, sir.

311
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:22,882
Very well.

312
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,252
Commence blowing main ballast.

313
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,123
Fire!
Fire!

314
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,397
If you'll ever see that
bag again, sir.

315
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,310
All hands, this is
the Captain speaking.

316
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,415
Our batteries are flat,

317
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,217
the main motors are flooded,

318
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,187
we are unable
to fire our torpedoes.

319
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,256
Therefore, the crew of this
ship, we're going to surrender.

320
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,625
Now keep calm.

321
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,296
You've been a good crew.

322
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,373
We've surfaced, sir.

323
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:10,556
May I introduce myself? I am Commander
Nagano, Imperial Japanese Navy.

324
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,492
Lieutenant-Commander Jefferson
Conway, United States Navy.

325
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,261
We followed your orders,
Commander.

326
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,296
Very sensible.

327
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,432
I asked you to remain here as
an insurance against accidents.

328
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,936
There won't be any accidents.
Good.

329
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,305
Then we'll begin our inspection.

330
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,842
You've got about 30 seconds to
get off this boat, Commander.

331
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,621
So long, old girl.

332
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,470
I'm Commander Mori of the
Japanese Intelligence Department.

333
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,706
I'm happy to tell you that
your Skipper is okay.

334
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:38,978
In fact, he should
be here in a moment.

335
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,814
Skipper! How are ya?
Skipper!

336
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,950
I'm glad to see you, sir.

337
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,803
Hi, you're all right?
I'm fine. How are you?

338
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,119
Good. We're good.

339
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:54,160
Now!

340
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:59,531
All your names, ranks and
serial numbers are on this list.

341
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,534
The rest of the crew is below
decks and well cared for.

342
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,005
It's going to be
a long war, gentlemen.

343
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,341
You should be glad
you're out of it.

344
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,482
This is sake, rice wine.

345
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,391
To your continued
good health, gentlemen.

346
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,500
Well, we have a lot
to talk over.

347
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,969
We've got nothing to
talk over, Commander.

348
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:39,023
You've got all the
information you're entitled to

349
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,673
under the terms of the Geneva Convention.
You know that.

350
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,843
We are not concerned with
that foolishness, Commander.

351
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:50,149
And we have a little more
information than you think.

352
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,398
Our divers have been busy,
as you can see.

353
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,467
And you have the thanks of
the Japanese Navy,

354
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,870
for shooting our ships with the
cameras instead of torpedoes.

355
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,508
All we'd like to know is, why?

356
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,378
That's just a hobby.

357
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,214
We're gonna enter 'em in the
"best photo of the year" contest.

358
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:27,253
I'm sorry, but we have to find
out all about your mission.

359
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:31,490
I don't have to tell you there
are many methods of doing this,

360
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,125
and we know them all.

361
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,263
Like I said,
it's going to be a long war.

362
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,404
Help yourself,
it's on the house.

363
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,483
I don't get it, Skipper.
Why all the hospitality?

364
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:06,558
Len, tell us about
your Uncle Petrie.

365
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,660
My uncle?
Yeah, your Uncle Petrie.

366
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:14,100
Well...

367
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:20,606
Uncle Petrie had
one bad habit, liquor.

368
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,309
- An uncle of yours, sir?
- Hard to believe.

369
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,847
You know how some people
save string?

370
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:33,919
Well, Uncle Petrie saved corks!

371
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,721
Amazing, sir!

372
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:37,923
Yeah. I mean...

373
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:42,494
He drank so much that at the end
of 26 years, he had enough corks

374
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,731
saved up to build
a fishing boat.

375
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:49,768
A boat made out of corks!
Genius, Lieutenant, sheer genius!

376
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,270
Yeah.
Well, that's nothing.

377
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,505
Wait till I tell ya
how he used to catch fish.

378
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,974
How did he do that?

379
00:32:56,108 --> 00:33:01,413
Well, the ocean was so soaked up with
all that liquor from those corks,

380
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:05,017
that the fish didn't wait
to be caught,

381
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:08,820
they just jumped in that
boat, dead drunk!

382
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,598
And that, my friends, is how Uncle
Petrie invented pickled herring.

383
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,745
Good morning.
Everyone in good shape?

384
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,449
Commander, when am I
gonna get to see my men?

385
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:41,853
They're on their way to a
regular prison camp, Commander.

386
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,190
But we have something
special for you five.

387
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,425
Your new home.

388
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:52,464
Welcome to the Interrogation
Camp Number Seven.

389
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,167
The torpedo boat
will be picking us up.

390
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:59,271
The Island's about three miles wide
and five long, if you're curious.

391
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,840
And if you're wondering,

392
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,376
it would even be
possible to escape,

393
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,978
for anybody who can
swim two hundred miles.

394
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,581
Follow me.

395
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,430
Well, welcome to
the Question and Answer Camp.

396
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,799
I'm Jammy Harris,
late of the Australian Air Force.

397
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,734
Jeff Conway, United States Navy.

398
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:05,337
This is Lieutenant Peg Whitcomb,
Australian Nursing Corps.

399
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,038
She's our medical staff.

400
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,574
Lieutenant, nice meeting you.

401
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,776
How's the war coming, Yank?

402
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,444
No better.
No worse.

403
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:14,012
It'll get worse, though.

404
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,106
They've pulled over half
their troops out of here.

405
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,584
That's very true.
They are shorthanded.

406
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,197
Yeah. There's a big
build-up going on.

407
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,288
We heard that
before we left Australia.

408
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,423
Listen, you don't think
they're going to...

409
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,924
Wait a minute!

410
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:28,960
Who's the girl?

411
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:33,232
An interpreter,
among other things.

412
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,667
She's a great and good
friend of the Japanese.

413
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,343
And the officer?

414
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,980
Captain Yamazaki,
head of the camp guard.

415
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,382
Is he as tough as he looks?

416
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,384
He doesn't have to be.

417
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,186
There's no escape
from this place.

418
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:58,757
I'm speaking for
Captain Yamazaki.

419
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,527
Prisoners will obey
all orders instantly.

420
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,464
Any disobedience or infraction
will be severely punished.

421
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,574
You are prisoners of war,
and will be shot if you attempt to escape.

422
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,548
Well, he's a man of few words.

423
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,350
Who's the Camp Commander?

424
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,518
We haven't had one
for several weeks.

425
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:30,055
We used to have
a Colonel named Takahishi.

426
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,624
Yeah. And you Yanks had better
pray he doesn't come back.

427
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,893
I've got a bit of
a sample of his work.

428
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,070
Which one of you
is Commander Conway?

429
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,972
I am.

430
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,040
My name is Karen Philips.

431
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,142
I'm the interpreter for
the Captain of the guard.

432
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,912
I'll bet you got the best
job on this whole island.

433
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,418
Len Ross, Lieutenant, U.S. Navy, ma'am.
Your enemy. Unfortunately.

434
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,052
All right.

435
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,654
What do you want?

436
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,990
You're to report
to Commander Mori.

437
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,625
Please follow me.

438
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,932
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

439
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,337
This Island, Commander Conway, has
been in my family for almost 200 years.

440
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,039
Before the war
it was a plantation.

441
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,542
How nice of 'em
to lend it to the Japanese.

442
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,244
While they're here,
I intend to cooperate with them.

443
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,979
But I'm neutral.

444
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,650
In my book, anybody who cooperates
with my enemies isn't neutral.

445
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,252
But you're neutralized
yourself now, Commander.

446
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,288
You're out of the war,
and you should be glad.

447
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,156
That's where you're wrong, lady.

448
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,226
I'm not out of it till I'm dead or
it's over, whichever one comes first.

449
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,529
Be sensible, Mr. Conway.

450
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,698
The Japanese are not unpleasant
if you cooperate with them.

451
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:48,272
You cooperate with them
all you want.

452
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,436
Just don't waste your breath
trying to convert me.

453
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:53,138
Don't you understand
that nothing can stop them?

454
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,111
How many more ships and
men do you have to lose

455
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,008
to convince you
that you're beaten?

456
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,620
I understand one thing
and one thing...

457
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:01,012
Please,
Commander Mori's in there.

458
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:20,999
Come in.

459
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,139
What do you think of
our tropical resort?

460
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,509
Delightful.
I'll take Miami Beach.

461
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:35,013
I'm glad to see you still have your
irrepressible American sense of humor.

462
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,616
Get to the point, Commander.
You're wasting time.

463
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,655
I hope not.
I sincerely hope not.

464
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,824
Cigarette?

465
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,597
No thanks, I'll smoke this.

466
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,098
I don't blame you.

467
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,737
There is really no smoke like
an American cigarette, is there?

468
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:05,444
We have a storage of fine
Virginia tobacco at the moment.

469
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,847
I hope it doesn't last too long.

470
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:18,790
Conway, I don't like this
war any more than you do.

471
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,660
Probably less,
as a matter of fact.

472
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:26,765
I spent a good many years in your country
and I have a great respect for your people.

473
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:30,335
Nobody will be happier than I
when these hostilities are over.

474
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,371
You must believe that.

475
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,974
All right.
I believe it.

476
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:40,846
I wonder how long that will be?

477
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,450
As long as it takes us
to win it.

478
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,919
Are all your countrymen
that confident?

479
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,187
Of course.

480
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,557
Why is that?

481
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,493
You say you lived in America.
You should know why.

482
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:57,362
There's only one way
this war can end, Commander.

483
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,300
I also know Japan
quite well, Mr. Conway.

484
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,638
We, too, are most ambitious
and industrious people.

485
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,275
There are important
differences, however.

486
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,345
For instance, you Americans
have a lot of physical courage,

487
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,250
but up here you're vulnerable.

488
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:22,854
So much so that it amazes me
how you won all the other wars.

489
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,056
Maybe we're lucky, Commander.

490
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,893
Always with the jokes?

491
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,666
This war
you are not going to win

492
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,070
for many reasons.

493
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,040
One of them is
the one ability I spoke of.

494
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,408
You make mistakes.

495
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,444
For example,

496
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,183
why didn't you blow up
your sub with all your men?

497
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,319
We Japanese would have
done that.

498
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,388
I figure we can do you more
harm alive than dead, Commander.

499
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,190
You think so?

500
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,126
I'm going to prove you wrong.

501
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,531
You have
the information we need,

502
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,500
and I'm going to
get it from you.

503
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,804
By the way,
please don't be alarmed

504
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:17,042
at the sight of any punishment
devices around the camp.

505
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:24,850
My predecessor here, Colonel Takahishi
employed these medieval methods.

506
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,786
Personally,
I don't believe in them.

507
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:30,989
There are other means.

508
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,091
Is that all, Commander?

509
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,861
Yes. We'll talk again.

510
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,465
And think carefully
about what I have said.

511
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,102
I'm thinking all the time,
Commander.

512
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,613
Mr. Conway, I must have
that information.

513
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:59,751
It's entirely up to you
whether I get it now, or later.

514
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,758
A rather old-fashioned method
of irrigation, I'll admit,

515
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,928
but my countrymen have used
it for several thousand years

516
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,462
and it still works fine.

517
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:48,299
You are in charge of the work
detail, Commander.

518
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,069
In charge, you understand?

519
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,538
You merely supervise,
you do not work.

520
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:56,174
I prefer not to take any
chances with your health.

521
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:58,576
You are important to us.

522
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:03,949
Commander, my men
change shifts every hour.

523
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,051
I suggest your men do the same.

524
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,789
By the way,

525
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:14,092
fresh water is scarce
on this island,

526
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,594
so I'll have to insist
that you don't drink any,

527
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:20,632
except what is furnished
at the mealtimes.

528
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:25,637
Mr. Bates, Mr. Ross,
you take the first shift.

529
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,674
Come on, let's go.

530
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:54,833
You see?
We are not unreasonable.

531
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,869
We wouldn't ask you to do
anything we don't do ourselves.

532
00:43:58,003 --> 00:44:02,774
Besides, the exercise will give
your men a healthy appetite.

533
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:05,777
For what? Chop Suey?
I never liked it.

534
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:09,414
That's Chinese, isn't it?
So sorry, old man.

535
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,212
Hour's up, Skipper.

536
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,551
I'll take it, Len.
I said, I'll take it. No...

537
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:52,858
Why, you...

538
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,726
I'm all right, Jeff!

539
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:17,548
Lord! I joined the Navy
because I hated marching!

540
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:21,019
You Tennessee pea-picker, you didn't
wear shoes until you went into Annapolis!

541
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,119
I guess he got a cold out there?

542
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,055
He's got no cold.
He's got pneumonia.

543
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,294
Is there anything we can do?

544
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,762
There's something you can do.

545
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:06,031
What?

546
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:08,900
Tell them whatever it is
they want to know.

547
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,071
That is, if you care at all
about the lives of your men.

548
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,779
The Japanese must not know
our rendezvous point.

549
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:25,250
If you'll have to scuttle yourself
and sacrifice every man on board

550
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,986
to prevent it, you'll do it.

551
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:31,389
You'll do it.
You'll do it.

552
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,178
You been smoking long?

553
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:54,712
Yeah.

554
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,984
Kind of rough on you
out there today?

555
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,055
If that's the most they
can give out, I can take it.

556
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,725
Can you take it for three days?

557
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:12,097
Why three days?

558
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,303
Because that's the day
of rendezvous.

559
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,641
What will happen
if we're not there?

560
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,376
They'll leave.

561
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,823
After that I will tell them
anything they want to know.

562
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,816
Might even tell 'em the location

563
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,352
of your Uncle Petrie's
sour-mash still.

564
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:53,404
Fellow white-collar workers,

565
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,340
we are about to receive a visit

566
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:59,510
from that champion of the
down-trodden, your friend and mine,

567
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,047
the smiler...

568
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:05,550
With interpreter.

569
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:10,922
You all right, Len?
Yeah.

570
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,823
Wait there, Bates.

571
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,097
Tell the Captain Lieutenant
Ross is too sick to work.

572
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:30,741
The Captain said he's just
following orders.

573
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:34,412
And reminds the prisoners that
they must also follow orders,

574
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:35,746
or be punished.

575
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,515
But the man can't walk.

576
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:49,160
He wants to know if you're ready to
answer Commander Mori's questions.

577
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,368
Tell him to go to hell.

578
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:20,325
Hey, Commander?
Commander!

579
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:22,893
What can I do for you, Conway?

580
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:24,429
Commander,
one of my men is sick.

581
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,597
I know. Mr. Ross, isn't it?
Sorry.

582
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:27,865
How are you feeling, though?

583
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:29,376
What difference does it make
how I'm feeling?

584
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,136
I say, how are you feeling?

585
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,614
What do you care how I'm feeling?
I'm telling you about one of my men.

586
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:34,972
I'm concerned about your health.

587
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,708
That is why you're not
allowed to walk the wheel.

588
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:40,778
I want you in good shape
when it comes time to vote.

589
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,289
To vote.
What are you talking about?

590
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,683
You know all about
democracy in America.

591
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,520
You vote on things,
majority rules.

592
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:53,424
Another few days on the water wheel
and your men will be ready to vote

593
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:56,961
on whether you talk,
or keep quiet.

594
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,997
If you talk,
no more water wheel,

595
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:03,234
if you don't,
Ross might get sicker.

596
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:05,136
He might even die.

597
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,271
So might the others.

598
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:07,838
What is it?

599
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,716
Is it the information you think I've got?
Is that it?

600
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,500
Well, put me on the wheel,
but take Ross off.

601
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,681
Mr. Conway,
you don't seem to understand.

602
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:20,651
Putting you on the wheel would
be defeating our own purpose.

603
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:22,853
What does that mean?

604
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:27,058
If anything happens to you,
we never get the information.

605
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:06,964
Is he any better?
No. He's worse.

606
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:09,634
If you care at all about Len
and the rest of your men,

607
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,345
tell them whatever it is
they want to know.

608
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,446
All right. Take it easy.
That water wheel's tough enough,

609
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,239
but nobody's going to die
from it.

610
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:17,151
I suppose Mori's given you a guarantee
that none of your men will be harmed?

611
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:18,476
It could be worse.

612
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:19,977
He's kept his word so far.

613
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,680
Yes, and Mori hasn't
produced any results, either.

614
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,383
If his methods continue to fail,

615
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,752
you can rely on Japanese
Intelligence to replace him.

616
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,487
This is all rather academic,
isn't it?

617
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,457
Sooner or later, you and your
men will begin to really suffer.

618
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,501
Is the information you have
worth all their lives?

619
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:36,327
That's my decision to make,
Lady Nightingale,

620
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:37,704
meanwhile, you just keep
your mouth out of it!

621
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,063
I've seen enough death!

622
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,599
Peg, please. Peg, please.
You're a swine.

623
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,174
I'm sorry.

624
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:53,154
I notice your men don't
have to work very much.

625
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:54,755
They treat them pretty good.
Why is that?

626
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,815
Did you give 'em all the
information they wanted to know?

627
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,552
I didn't have the information
they thought I had.

628
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:04,755
I finally convinced
Colonel Takahishi of that

629
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:07,358
after three of my men
had been put to death.

630
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,697
As for not working us too
hard, I don't know about that.

631
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,934
They were getting ready to transfer
us, when you blokes showed up.

632
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:20,037
Something changed their minds.
I've no idea what.

633
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:21,982
Maybe it's some more of
his advanced psychology.

634
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,475
Maybe he figures that your
group can soften us up.

635
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:26,287
You seemed to be doing
a pretty good job of it.

636
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:28,088
Well, it could be, Conway.
What do you propose to do about it?

637
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:29,146
Get out.
That's what.

638
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,781
What, escape?
Right!

639
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:33,484
From a Jap-held island,
five miles by three,

640
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,119
in the middle of
a Japanese ocean?

641
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:36,787
It's impossible.

642
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:41,158
It's still called the Pacific Ocean.
They don't own it yet.

643
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:49,700
If we could get that torpedo
boat we came in the cove with,

644
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:54,305
there aren't more than
a dozen guards here.

645
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:56,541
Yes, and they've all got guns.

646
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:13,358
All right, gentlemen,
tea on the after-patio.

647
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,095
I'm so fed up with all
those eggs and bacon.

648
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:19,697
It's the silver plates
I can't stand.

649
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,432
Well, if you gentlemen
would like,

650
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:23,634
I'll take you out for breakfast.

651
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:47,892
Give my compliments to
the Chef, would you?

652
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,227
Left-over old socks this time.

653
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,530
Boy, I love you.

654
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:19,023
Very funny! You wouldn't be laughing so
loud without all those guns around you.

655
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,659
I'll guarantee you that!

656
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,193
Bates!

657
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:33,804
Would you like me to translate the
Sergeant's last remarks for you?

658
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,215
That won't be necessary,
Commander.

659
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,799
We've all got a good idea
what he meant.

660
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:41,178
I doubt that.
It was a challenge, Mr. Bates.

661
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:44,382
In effect, he said
if you weren't a prisoner,

662
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:45,983
he would take you apart.

663
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,520
Yeah? Well you tell that son of a...
Knock it off, Bates!

664
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:52,823
Shall I tell him his
challenge is not accepted?

665
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,125
Skipper, I can handle
that big, fat slob.

666
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:57,695
Let me take a crack at
him, will you?

667
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:00,498
Frankly, I wouldn't
advise you to try.

668
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,000
The Sergeant's very good
at the art of wrestling,

669
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,802
as are all Japanese soldiers.

670
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,805
Skipper, I know something about
that Japanese-style wrestling.

671
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:11,709
I've been in the Navy for 15 years and
spent most of my time in the Far East.

672
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:14,545
I've flattened my share of
these characters.

673
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,582
Bates can take him, Skipper.
I've seen him in action.

674
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:19,016
Well, Commander?

675
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:21,619
Go ahead, Bates.

676
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,499
Give em' room, fellas.

677
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:36,901
Get that rice picker, Bates.

678
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,202
Jump on him, boy.

679
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,758
Get up, Bates. Get up, Bates.
Watch him. Come on, Bates.

680
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:13,438
Get up, boy, come on!
Get up!

681
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:15,706
Get him. Get him!

682
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:19,910
Get him!

683
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,552
Come on! Get up on your feet!
Watch out, Bates!

684
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,628
Get him! Get on your feet!
Hold him, Bates, get him!

685
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,063
Come on! Break it up.
That's it!

686
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,421
Stop it! Stop it!

687
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:14,198
Now, simmer down!

688
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,816
All right.

689
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:37,021
Sit down, Commander.
I'll stand.

690
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:40,791
I don't suppose an apology
from me would mean anything?

691
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:42,693
Not a damn thing.

692
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:47,532
It was my intention to demonstrate the
superiority of the Japanese soldier.

693
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,869
The psychological
approach, again.

694
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:54,572
And it backfired.

695
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:57,207
You mean, that fight was
your idea?

696
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:02,613
Yes. Oshikawa was acting under my
orders when he challenged your man.

697
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:05,508
And when he picked up a rifle and
killed him, whose orders were those?

698
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:10,821
You know better than
to ask that, Commander.

699
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,425
I am truly sorry.

700
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:23,333
I never would have suggested the
contest if I had had any idea that...

701
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:31,609
It's quite obvious now that my psychological
methods are not going to work now.

702
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:34,579
None of your methods are going to work.
Not now or ever.

703
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:36,013
Possibly not.

704
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:41,351
In any case,
I have been given another assignment.

705
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,825
I am being relieved by my
predecessor, Colonel Takahishi.

706
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:53,998
As you know, his ways of obtaining
information are different from mine.

707
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:55,465
I heard.

708
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:03,774
I'm speaking now as one human being to
another, not as one enemy to another.

709
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:10,447
You may all be killed at
Colonel Takahishi's orders

710
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,382
if you continue your silence.

711
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,086
More psychology, Commander?

712
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,658
No, the facts.

713
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:29,700
Again. I'm very sorry
about this morning.

714
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:34,739
I'm sorrier about what I know
is going to happen to you.

715
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:39,910
I believe in this war, Conway.

716
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:44,081
And I believe in striking the enemy
and killing him if he resists.

717
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,252
But I don't believe in murder.

718
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:53,724
They're sending a boat for me,
and I'm leaving this evening.

719
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,861
Goodbye, Commander.

720
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:21,719
Mr. Conway.

721
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:24,822
Yeah?

722
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,592
I thought you might like
to have this Bible.

723
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:33,530
Thanks.

724
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,666
I'll give it back
in the morning.

725
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,301
Please keep it.

726
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:41,772
I thought it might help
comfort you and your friends.

727
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,676
Aid and comfort to
the enemy, Miss Philips?

728
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:48,445
I'm not your enemy.

729
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:51,015
Whose are you?

730
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,285
I told you, I'm neutral.

731
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,757
Still?

732
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:02,526
No. Not anymore.

733
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,072
Will you help us?

734
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,143
We need weapons.

735
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,479
I can't possibly do that.

736
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,615
That's what I figured.

737
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:29,486
You can't escape.
You'll only get killed trying.

738
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:43,700
I couldn't bring any guns,
maybe some knife blades.

739
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,704
Get 'em.

740
01:02:34,118 --> 01:02:35,685
There's your lady friend.

741
01:02:37,888 --> 01:02:39,456
So early in the morning, too.

742
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:51,301
Miss Japanese
Interrogation Camp of 1942.

743
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,436
Yeah.

744
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:56,273
I wonder what she's
doing around here.

745
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,343
Come on, Jeff.

746
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:02,346
You don't really think she's
going to help us, do you?

747
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,052
Come on, Peg, let's take a walk.

748
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:19,396
Now, what did you forget?
Be casual, Peg. Casual.

749
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:27,137
Miss Whitcomb, come over here.
Get angry at me.

750
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:30,474
And when you hit me, grab my hat.
Come on, hurry up.

751
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:32,943
Go ahead, Peg.

752
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:41,585
Miserable wench!
You no-good, treacherous female!

753
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,124
Grab my hat!
Hurry up!

754
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:54,865
Go inside and rip it apart.
Go on, rip it apart. Go on!

755
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,301
Where'd you get that?

756
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,369
Hey!

757
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,974
They're like razors.
Knife blades.

758
01:04:04,108 --> 01:04:05,409
Without a handle, Len.

759
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,411
It's a cinch.

760
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:11,949
It's hardwood.

761
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:15,319
Peg?
Yeah.

762
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:18,122
Have you got any thread?

763
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:19,823
Well, only a little.

764
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,626
Well, will you unravel
a blanket or some clothes?

765
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:25,195
Sure. I'm gonna bind
the handles with thread.

766
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:28,174
I don't know if I ever told you, but
my Uncle Petrie's part Seminole Indian.

767
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,034
And boy, did he ever teach me...

768
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,801
Jeff! Jeff!

769
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:34,304
Yeah.

770
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,573
Like I said, look...

771
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,475
This is hardwood.
Yeah.

772
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,244
I could make a bow out of that.

773
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:41,678
A bow?
Sure.

774
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,656
And bowstrings you can
make out of twill thread.

775
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,315
You know, out of uniforms,
anything.

776
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:48,052
And arrows are simple
to carve out of anything.

777
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:50,921
Arrowheads are easy.
I used to make 'em out of tin cans.

778
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:58,528
We can make 'em out of these.
I used to be a pretty fair archer.

779
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:02,266
You know, if we can knock over
just one guard and get his gun,

780
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,968
we might have a chance.

781
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,036
About one in 50.

782
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,975
With those floodlights on every
second, it's not going to be easy.

783
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,944
Yeah.

784
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,790
Hide the stuff!
Here comes the brass!

785
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:56,220
The Captain orders you to line up in
front of your bunks while he speaks.

786
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:18,275
He says your leg was not
stiff yesterday.

787
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,811
Well...

788
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:26,316
Tell him that I have a very rare American
disease. It's extremely contagious.

789
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,436
Commander Mori will be replaced
tomorrow by Colonel Takahishi.

790
01:06:48,072 --> 01:06:49,306
Tomorrow?

791
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:50,850
That means we've got to
break out of here tonight.

792
01:06:50,874 --> 01:06:53,943
Is there a shortcut
to the boat? A stream?

793
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:06,090
He says Colonel Takahishi will kill
you if you do not answer directly

794
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:08,292
every question he asks.

795
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:11,095
Do you know where
the generator is?

796
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:13,308
Wreck it at four o'clock.
We'll meet you at the boat.

797
01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:21,771
Tell him
we appreciate his advice,

798
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:23,973
and we'll give it
careful consideration.

799
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,852
He wants you to stand at
attention when he leaves.

800
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:39,789
Attention!

801
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,973
I hope this thing works!

802
01:07:57,107 --> 01:08:01,077
You hit 'em with that, they're going to
make a noise like a bag of squashed cats.

803
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:53,290
Taki?

804
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,613
Taki? Taki?

805
01:11:54,578 --> 01:11:57,914
Come on. Come on!
Let's get out of here!

806
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:31,040
Jamie!

807
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:37,614
Jamie!

808
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,724
Sorry, Peg,
I don't think I can make it.

809
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:49,158
You'll have to go on without me.

810
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,860
What happened to Len?

811
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:52,762
I'm afraid...

812
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,364
I'm afraid he bolted.

813
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:58,602
But we got some
of the others, though.

814
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,277
Come on, Peg.

815
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:38,642
Is he dead?

816
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:39,776
Yeah.

817
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:42,746
What about Len?

818
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:44,247
Him too, sir.

819
01:14:48,552 --> 01:14:49,592
Can you make it all right?

820
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:51,320
Yeah, it's all right.

821
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:54,558
Look, Jeff, we're going to have to
shoot our way down to that boat.

822
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:56,726
Guards downstream?

823
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,361
Yeah. I don't know
how many, though.

824
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:01,230
Can't be more than one or two.
We've killed everybody else.

825
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,834
Wait here.

826
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,885
What happened?

827
01:15:56,586 --> 01:15:57,821
Everything's okay.

828
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:00,556
Any sign of Karen?

829
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,559
No.

830
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,926
Skipper, we're running
out of time!

831
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:47,136
It'll be light pretty soon.
You go back to the boat.

832
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,781
If I'm not there in a
half-an-hour, you go without me.

833
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:50,874
Look, Jeff...
I said, take off!

834
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:52,608
Halliday.
Yeah.

835
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:29,612
Think we ought to shove off?

836
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:31,447
We'll take five more minutes.

837
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,350
Prepare to shove off.

838
01:19:28,965 --> 01:19:31,935
I'll take over now, sir,
if you want some rest.

839
01:19:32,068 --> 01:19:34,637
Steer 235.
That's as good a course as any.

840
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,305
Two-three-five, aye, sir.

841
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:16,612
Karen, Karen! Brake! Brake!
Hey, come on. Come on.

842
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:40,569
Hey! Look at that!

843
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:45,574
Can you read them?
Something Conway, U.S.N.

844
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,080
And "Fancy Free"!

845
01:20:52,315 --> 01:20:53,449
Fancy Free?

846
01:20:56,285 --> 01:21:00,189
I'm gonna set down alongside of them.
Tell the crew to stand by!

847
01:21:00,323 --> 01:21:02,058
Right.

848
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,071
Co-Pilot to crew. We're going to set
down by that torpedo boat. Stand by.

849
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:28,784
We trailed them on a South easterly
course at about 5,000 yards.

850
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:30,753
When we last saw them,
they were here.

851
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:35,224
We moved in to get a closer look and
that's when we ran into their minefield.

852
01:21:35,358 --> 01:21:38,127
Did you recognize
any of their ships?

853
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:42,598
Yes, there was three
carriers of the Shoho class.

854
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,468
I'm certain they were part of Admiral
Hara's Fifth Carrier Division.

855
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,170
That makes sense.

856
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:50,940
They're in the Coral Sea now if
they haven't changed direction.

857
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,976
There's no reason why
they should.

858
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:55,979
They're headed for Port Moresby.

859
01:21:56,112 --> 01:22:01,517
If our Intelligence is correct,
they'll hit it in exactly three days.

860
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,851
Unless we locate them first.

861
01:22:02,986 --> 01:22:04,820
We'll find them.

862
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:08,324
Every plane we can spare will be put in
that part of the Coral Sea immediately.

863
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:53,469
CIC two unidentified planes,
in bound at 20 miles...

864
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:58,707
If you're thinking of the ship you lost, that
some of your men died for nothing, don't.

865
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:01,877
Think of the lives you saved by
getting us the information we wanted,

866
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:06,382
when we wanted it.
Think of that, Jeff. Think of that.

867
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,805
On the 7th of May, 1942,

868
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:32,041
the Battle of the Coral Sea
took place.

869
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:52,748
When it was over, the Fifth Carrier
Division of the Imperial Japanese Navy

870
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,517
had been stopped.

871
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:55,984
Australia was saved.

872
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:04,059
All three of the largest enemy
carriers were destroyed or disabled.

873
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:08,397
The United States' greatest loss in
the battle was the Carrier Lexington,

874
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:10,933
the Fighting Lady.

875
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:22,678
It was the greatest naval
engagement in history,

876
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:26,782
and the victory laid the groundwork
for the even greater sea victory

877
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:33,088
at Midway, where the back of the
Imperial Japanese Navy was broken.
