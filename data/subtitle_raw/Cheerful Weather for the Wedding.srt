00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,758
Pure wallflower.

342
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,842
(LAUGHS)

343
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,136
Which is just the way l like it.

344
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:37,813
Joseph, since you are here,
can you please join in like everyone else?

345
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,690
l'm praying to St Anthony.

346
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,444
BOB: Think l'll join you.
Patron saint of lost articles.

347
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,780
And missing persons.

348
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,782
Eureka! l've found it.

349
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,658
Oh, thank heaven!

350
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,119
Well done, Evie!

351
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,454
St Anthony never lets me down.

352
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,955
Come on, darling, let's get you to the church.

353
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,457
-Yes.
-All's well.

354
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,253
Your prayers were answered.

355
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,714
Well, there's a first time for everything.

356
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,721
-You planning to bag the canon, Evie?
-Don't be ridiculous.

357
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,557
-A widower with two obstreperous sons.
-A rich widower.

358
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,976
lt doesn't bear thinking about.

359
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,563
Might be fun for a while, though.

360
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,857
ls that what Dolly's thinking?

361
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,656
-Why is she avoiding me?
-She's avoiding all of us, darling.

362
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,494
l'm not sure why she asked me.

363
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,789
And now that l'm here,
l don't know why l came.

364
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:41,502
You came because you wanted to,
and because Dolly wanted you to be here.

365
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,005
-She's got a funny way of showing it.
-So have you, Joseph.

366
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,844
lf you're just doing this to be difficult,
l'd get out while you still can.

367
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,429
That's exactly what l want to tell Dolly.

368
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,680
MRS THATCHAM: Whatever next?

369
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,141
Evelyn, my dear, can you bring
Dolly's little bouquet to her?

370
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,018
-lt's somewhere in the kitchen.
-Of course.

371
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,690
Time is ticking by, everyone.

372
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,734
Very, very slowly.

373
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,404
There you are, Horace!

374
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:12,366
Oh, such a beautiful day for Dolly's wedding!

375
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,118
Have l missed it?

376
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,537
l've put you in the Chinese room,

377
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,290
-and you have a very nice view from there.
-How lovely.

378
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,374
The Chinese room?

379
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,752
Mum, how many more people
are to go into the Chinese room?

380
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,594
-Nancy, can l borrow you this afternoon?
-What is it, Hettie?

381
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,555
Will you keep an eye open for Dolly
just in case l'm not around to watch her?

382
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,641
-She's awfully tired.
-Certainly.

383
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,353
That academic friend of hers...

384
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,521
Mmm?

385
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,690
-Joseph?
-Yes, him.

386
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,734
l think he may try to be

387
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,653
troublesome.

388
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,821
Oh.

389
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:55,242
-Unfinished business, you mean?
-Well, l don't know about that.

390
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,578
Aren't they old enough
to look after themselves, Hettie?

391
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,415
Yes, of course, Nancy dear,
but it would make me feel better all the same

392
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,542
if you could, just...

393
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,045
Yes, of course. l'll see what l can do.

394
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,923
You and David are
such a lovely example to Dolly.

395
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,343
-And we're both so very fond of you.
-(CHUCKLlNG) That's true.

396
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,388
Come along. We'll get your coat.

397
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,350
HORACE: Who is that girl?

398
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,185
"Fond"?

399
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,230
They say you can meet your future spouse
at a wedding,

400
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:28,943
but that seems incredibly unlikely
unless l marry a half-wit or a relative.

401
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,069
Or both.

402
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,112
Do you think there'll be any men in uniform
at the reception?

403
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,407
Look, Kitty, isn't Dolly dressed yet?

404
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,202
lf l were getting married,
l'd have been ready at dawn.

405
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,746
lf you were getting married,
it would be more like pistols at dawn.

406
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,123
l suppose
that very narrow-minded people think

407
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,669
that Dolly is the romantic sister,
and l'm the lumpy, sensible one.

408
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,420
Nobody thinks you're sensible.

409
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,590
Dolly is absolutely efficient
when it comes down to it.

410
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,717
lmpetuous, l'll grant you,

411
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,637
but underneath it all, she's 1 00% hard-boiled.

412
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,015
Look, can't you get her to come down?
l need to...

413
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,644
l'd like to wish her luck
whilst she's still an unmarried woman.

414
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,563
Maybe it's Mum.

415
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,940
She does make
living in this house unbearable.

416
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,318
Look what she did
with Millman and luncheon.

417
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,946
Sometimes l wonder if it's all an act.

418
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,366
What could be a better disguise
than a fussy old widow?

419
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,202
She is a curious person, really.

420
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,455
Mum, l mean.

421
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,876
Aren't you feeling well, Joseph?

422
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,837
Oh, dear.

423
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,674
l had counted on you as being
the one bright spot at this awful gathering.

424

Whitstable?
ls that my tortoise come back again?

425
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,056
Yes, miss.

426
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,226
l've seen him snuggling up
against the glass-house stove pipe.

427
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,686
He must think it's spring.

428
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,647
Could you take her to the kitchen
and get the girls to pack her up for me?

429
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,858
They can use a biscuit tin or something.

430
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,027
l've just the thing for that, miss.
He'll be just fine.

431
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,945
She'll be just fine, you mean?

432
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,867
He's a she, Whitstable.

433
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,039
-ls he really, miss?
-Yes, of course she is.

434
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,793
l'm going to take her to South America.
lt's not so cold and windy down there.

at certain things is absolutely beastly!

KlTTY: Joseph is
one of those annoying guests

the success of a party entirely depends.

KlTTY: Very well then.

489
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:11,350
l told Joseph
that an Englishman in love lacks poetry.

490
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,101
That was how it started.

491
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:17,189
And they do. Englishmen do lack poetry.

492
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,275
l told him about that awful Robinson boy
down at Malton. Do you remember?

493
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,485
-No.
-You know,

494
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,570
how when he was driving me home
after the dance that time,

495
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,365
and his car packed up at 5:00 in the morning.

496
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,409
And instead of looking at the sunrise
or at me,

497
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,163
all he could do was grumble along
with a face black as thunder.

498
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,875
He kept saying,
"After tonight my name is mud in Malton!"

499
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,043
"My dear chap," l said to him,

500
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,839
"really, what does it matter
if your name is mud in a place like Malton?"

501
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,926
l told Joseph l envied Barbara Mackenzie
her Spanish naval officer.

502
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,053
Who wouldn't?

503
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,764
He plays to her on his ukulele
in the moonlight,

504
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,350
and he's not ashamed of his love for her.

505
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,019
Oh! l'm going to Spain next year,
by the way, Doll, if mum will let me.

506
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,107
-She won't let you go.
-Why not? She let you go to Albania.

507
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,735

he'd play the ukulele beautifully,

01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,761
To me that seems so curious!

1191
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:45,436
Have a chocolate, Robert.
Kitty? So very delicious.

1192
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:48,939
Thank you.

1193
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:54,069
Joseph, why don't you just help yourself?

1194
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:02,619
You know, you young men nowadays
always seem to mope about the place.

1195
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:06,957
Never seeming to care
to pull yourselves together,

1196
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,502
stand up nice and square
and walk along properly.

1197
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:14,923
Or to join in with other people's fun.

1198
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,135
Don't you know what l mean?

1199
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:20,763
And yet you're never lagging behind,
l notice,

1200
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:25,267
when it comes to raising your voices
in criticism of other people.

1201
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,769
-Now, you, Joseph...
-Mum...

1202
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:29,813
You, Joseph, have had everything
you want from life.

1203
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,441
The profession you wanted,
a first-rate education,

1204
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:36,987
a most devoted mother, and yet here
you seem to be all up against everybody.

1205
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,490
Nothing seems good enough for you.

1206
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:44,286
Now l may be very dense, l freely confess,

1207
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:47,831
but l utterly fail to understand it!

1208
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:57,091
Of course, you may be very dense.

1209
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,384
That might be the very reason.

1210
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:04,264
You can't understand why no one arrives
when you think they should.

1211
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,516
And then you can't understand

1212
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:08,936
why the canon and Miss Spoon come
to be sharing a bedroom, can you?

1213
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,980
You couldn't grasp how it was that
Millman could have been such an odd person

1214
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:13,524
as to lay the luncheon in the dining room!

1215
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:17,528
ln fact, you don't really understand anyone
or anything around you, do you?

1216
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:20,072
l'm sure l don't know
what on Earth you mean.

1217
01:25:20,156 --> 01:25:23,117
l ought not to tell you this,
l suppose, but l'm going to.

1218
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:27,329
You don't know, do you, why your daughter
married with such indecent haste?

1219
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,374
Of course in another month or two,
we would all know why.

1220
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,919
Mind you, as to whom the father is,
well, there l am as ignorant as you are.

1221
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:35,170
You're mad.

1222
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,548
lt was inevitable that you would be
the last person to know about it.

1223
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,383
Stop it. Think about what you're saying.

1224
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:41,593
Yes, it may be mine.

1225
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:45,305
They're having a sweepstake in the kitchen.
lt's not too late to place a bet.

-Joseph!
-My money's on Aunt Bella's chauffeur.

1228
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:54,690
Of course, Dolly must have despaired
at even attempting to explain it to you.

1229
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:58,777
-Explain what?
-That this isn't the first time either!

1230

Why else do you think
Dolly Thatcham is always running away?

1231
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:06,702
l have no idea what on Earth
you are talking about!

1232
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:09,913
What l am talking about is perfectly simple.

1233
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:17,546

Of course not, Mama.

Don't pay any attention. He's drunk.
