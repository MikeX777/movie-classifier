1
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,000
Putra Al Fatih. Annisa Santosa.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,208
Santosa is my dad's name, sir.

3
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,291
Ilham Santosa.

4
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,333
How old are you guys?

5
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,541
-I'm 20.
-I'm 18.

6
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,541
Are you serious?
You really want to get married?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,208
Aren't you still in school?

8
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,625
Ninis is still in high school,
but she'll graduate soon.

9
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,916
As for me, I'm not in high school anymore.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,958
I'm attending college now.

11
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,541
Then who told you guys to get married?

12
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,250
-I myself.
-My dad.

13
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,250
I see. An arranged marriage.

14
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:18,291
Sis, there are laws
and conditions to get married.

15
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,500
First,

16
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,041
you must be a Muslim.

17
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:27,916
Second, the groom must not be
a family member of the bride.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,083
Thirdly, there must be a valid custodian
present when the wedding vows take place.

19
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:36,625
Fourth, you must not wed
while undertaking a major or minor hajj.

20
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,000
Fifth.

21
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,708
You must not be being pressured into it.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,125
You are here to get married.

23
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you being pressured into this or not?

24
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,875
-Inshallah, no, sir.
-No, sir.

25
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,291
You two know each other well?

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,916
-Yes sir.
-No sir.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
What is going on here?

28
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,916
How could you not know each other?

29
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,583
Please explain it to me.

30
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,541
Well, I don't know Putra that well, sir.

31
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,500
It's my dad who chose Putra
to be my husband.

32
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,083
But I'm sure and convinced
that my dad's choice

33
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,208
is what's best for me.

34
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:18,625
You said you knew her.
How did you get to know her?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,375
I follow her Instagram account, sir.

36
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,666
<i>Almost every day, I see what she posts.</i>

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,500
<i>I put likes on all her photos.</i>

38
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>When she posts something,</i>

39
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,958
<i>I'm the first one to comment.</i>

40
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,458
<i>When she attends seminars with her dad,</i>

41
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,833
<i>I also go.</i>

42
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,250
<i>I sit in the front row.</i>

43
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,958
For me, family is everything.

44
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:49,250
<i>100% Halal</i> is a book
based on my personal experiences.

45
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,708
With this book

46
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,666
I want to motivate you all
to get married young.

47
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,708
You must all know Annisa.

48
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,041
BOOK TALK: 100 PERCENT HALAL
ILHAM SANTOSA, WRITER

49
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,791
My beloved daughter.

50
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,833
I've been telling her
to also get married young.

51
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,041
Maybe someone here is interested.

52
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,291
Please see me first

53
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,458
if you're ready and brave enough.

54
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:23,333
From that moment on, sir,
I've never missed Mr. Ilham's seminars,

55
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,416
or any events attended by Ninis.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,291
I got red marks all over.
How come you always get good marks, Nis?

57
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,416
I study.
You should have studied, too, Lit.

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,333
Lita, do you want to improve
your red grades?

59
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,833
Of course. How?

60
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,750
Put eye drops on your marks.

61
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,041
Instead of red,
they'll be clear and bright.

62
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,625
Archery trains us to concentrate
and focus on our aim.

63
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,000
-Understand?
-Yes, sis.

64
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,208
Thank you.

65
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,291
Sir.

66
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,666
My name is Putra.
I'm asking for your daughter's hand.

67
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,500
So, you see, sir.
I know everything about Ninis.

68
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,125
I know all about her family,

69
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,916
what activities she's interested in,

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,583
what her favorite color is,
her favorite food,

71
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,208
and also who her best friends are.

72
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,041
-Ouch!
-Lita!

73
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,416
You and your light, feather-weight figure.

74
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,250
Sorry, sir.

75
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,625
Hi, Nis.

76
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,750
Let me tell you…

77
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:34,458
Marriage is not like dating
where you break up and make up repeatedly.

78
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,583
No, sir. I never date.

79
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,125
Dad says dating opens
the opportunity to commit adultery.

80
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,208
That's why my dad asked me to marry young.

81
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,208
Let me explain.

82
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,583
There's more than meets the eye
in a marriage.

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:53,041
You have to think about
where you will stay after getting married.

84
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,666
We'll live in my house, sir. With my dad.

85
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,500
You, Putra.
How will you provide for your wife?

86
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,458
-I will…
-My dad will provide, sir.

87
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,916
He will help us out.

88
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:10,000
You will be the head of the family.

89
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:15,416
You have to provide
for the needs of your wife.

90
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,291
Inshallah, my dad will provide for us.

91
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,875
He will give guidance.

92
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,583
He will give examples as to how
to be a responsible head of the family.

93
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,916
You keep saying "my dad" Again and again!

94
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,583
Are you marrying your dad or him?

95
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,000
OK, fine.

96
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,958
If you're serious about getting married,

97
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,458
have you learned the prayer for the act?

98
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,708
Which prayer, sir?

99
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,583
The prayer for… you know.

100
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,375
-Which prayer, sir?
-The prayer for that act.

101
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,416
-What act?
-What act?

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,458
Don't you get it already?

103
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,041
-The prayer for before copulating.
-Body cleaning?

104
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,500
Copulating. Not body cleaning.

105
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:00,875
How do I put this?

106
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,291
Ah, sis?

107
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:08,041
How do children nowadays say "copulating"?

108
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,208
You mean "ML," sir?

109
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,208
-Isn't that what you mean, sir?
-Ah, that's right.

110
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,291
Say, how come you know?

111
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,000
About the term "making love"?

112
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,000
Can it be that you…?

113
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,875
What a despicable thing to say, sir.

114
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,125
I'm a pure woman.

115
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,291
I'm protecting the honor of myself,
the nation, and the country.

116
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,875
I was just joking.

117
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:41,041
-You've never made love?
-Of course not, Rel.

118
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,125
To wrap things up…

119
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:47,458
Let me remind you not to forget
the prayer before copulating.

120
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,000
There's a prayer for that?

121
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,250
Yes. Listen.

122
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,416
Say with me.

123
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,666
In the name of Allah.

124
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,833
-In the name of Allah.
-"In the name of Allah."

125
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,125
-O Allah.
-"O Allah."

126
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,833
-Keep the devil away from us.
-"Keep the devil away from us."

127
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,291
-And keep the devil away.
-"And keep the devil away."

128
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,291
-From what You blessed us with.
-"From what You blessed us with."

129
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,541
-Amen.
-Amen.

130
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,500
-You're so deep into it.
-I can't wait to experience it myself.

131
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,541
Have you practiced
saying the wedding vows?

132
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,375
I have, sir.

133
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,375
Give me your hand.

134
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,833
<i>Putra Al Fatih, I marry off</i>
<i>my daughter Annisa Santosa to you,</i>

135
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,333
with a <i>mahr </i>of ten grams of gold jewelry

136
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,666
and a set of worship equipment
paid in cash.

137
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,708
I accept the marriage of Annisa Santosa,
daughter of Ilham Santosa,

138
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,291
with the <i>mahr </i>mentioned above,
paid in cash.

139
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,500
-Is it valid, dear witnesses?
-Valid!

140
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,041
All praise is due to Allah.

141
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,625
Not valid!

142
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,500
The marriage is not valid!

143
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,500
Do you agree?

144
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,375
Do you agree?

145
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,958
Do you agree that
the marriage is not valid?

146
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,041
Let's continue, sir.

147
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,000
What's wrong, Grandma?

148
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,125
Mom, please don't act like that.

149
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:37,332
-Ninis is now Putra's wife…
-Shut your mouth!

150
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,791
I want Ninis to sleep with me tonight.
I insist!

151
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,666
It's all right, Nis.

152
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,291
You sleep with Grandma tonight.

153
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,833
Are you sure it's all right?

154
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, Grandma. Tonight…

155
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,416
I will sleep with you in here.

156
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:22,750
<i>The night has come</i>

157
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:28,916
<i>Go to sleep, my dear</i>

158
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:34,541
<i>The prayer that follows</i>

159
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,416
<i>All through the night</i>

160
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,000
<i>Will put you sound asleep</i>

161
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:51,291
<i>And soothe your heart</i>

162
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:57,458
<i>Until the morning comes</i>

163
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,541
<i>And we welcome its light</i>

164
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,708
Come in.

165
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,625
Wow!

166
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,208
Darling.

167
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,833
-Darling.
-What?

168
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,041
Just a moment. Let me go to the restroom.

169
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,041
OK.

170
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,208
Just a moment.

171
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,291
Come on, Lit, Rel. Pick up.

172
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,333
You're both about to sleep?
Help me out here.

173
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,625
<i>What is going on, Nis?</i>

174
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,083
<i>Calling at this hour…</i>

175
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,375
You're disturbing my me time.

176
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,708
<i>What is wrong, Nis?</i>

177
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,708
<i>I haven't slept yet.</i>

178
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,833
By the way, aren't you supposed to be

179
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,416
copulating?

180
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,791
<i>Don't forget to pray beforehand.</i>

181
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:37,000
But I'm confused.
I don't know how to start.

182
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,916
You're worrying
over such an unnecessary thing.

183
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,666
<i>It's easy.</i>

184
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,500
Just lie down
and stick your body onto him.

185
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,416
What are you guys babbling about?

186
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,291
Don't confuse me even more. Help me out.

187
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,666
<i>Have you taken a bath?</i>

188
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,333
<i>Of course I have!</i>

189
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,083
<i>Have you brushed your teeth?</i>

190
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,666
Otherwise,

191
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,333
<i>your lovely time will be disturbed by</i>

192
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,541
<i>smelly breath.</i>

193
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,416
<i>Phew.</i>

194
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,375
<i>Lita,</i>

195
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,041
what a big mouth you have.

196
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,500
Well, you can see

197
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,708
<i>how tense Nissa is.</i>

198
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,541
I don't know what to do.

199
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,666
You both know well

200
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,958
that I've never been around boys.

201
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:23,666
That's true. Remember what
Grandma Yos used to say?

202
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,666
"Put a distance between yourself and boys,
one and a half meters!

203
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,750
Don't stare into each other's eyes!"

204
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,333
Well, she said it for my own benefit.

205
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,291
Especially after my mom passed away.

206
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,500
Grandma Yos is so possessive.

207
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:42,041
I thought she'd get over it
once I got married,

208
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,625
but she's still possessive.

209
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,166
She still is?

210
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,500
Nis, are you all right?

211
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,583
I'm all right, darling.

212
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,000
See, guys…

213
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,791
Just go ahead. Change your clothes.

214
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,500
Don't forget to wear the lingerie

215
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,875
<i>that I gifted to you.</i>

216
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,666
<i>Don't wear your typical sleeping clothes.</i>
<i>Go ahead. Change!</i>

217
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,500
Are you serious?

218
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,041
<i>Dead serious. Go ahead. Change.</i>

219
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,375
Change!

220
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,958
They just hung up?

221
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,625
Lita, Aurel. Some friends you are.

222
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,083
3 MONTHS LATER

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,250
PREGNANT

224
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,541
-Ninis!
-Ninis!

225
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:25,500
<i>Congratulations. You did it!</i>

226
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,833
By the way, how can you be pregnant?

227
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,916
Because she has a husband, of course.

228
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,166
She's so smart and yet clueless.

229
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,250
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>how does it feel to be pregnant?</i>

230
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,500
Spill and tell us!

231
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,666
<i>Nothing extraordinary.</i>

232
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,208
I've been feeling nauseous since yesterday
and weak, too.

233
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,375
It turns out they're signs of this gift.

234
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,916
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,375
<i>Your post went viral.</i>

236
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,791
That pic of your test pack
got 456,321 likes.

237
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,583
Wow, you know the numbers so well.

238
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:05,291
<i>-Of course, I'm an expert.</i>
-Oh my. Such a huge number.

239
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,625
-You should have a giveaway for the fans.
-Everyone's doing it.

240
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,375
Once again, congratulations.

241
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,916
Thank you, guys.

242
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,666
Cheers!

243
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,958
-<i>Assalamu alaikum, Nis.</i>
-Waalaikumsalam.

244
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,375
<i>Are you really pregnant?</i>

245
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,041
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

246
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,208
I'm so happy.

247
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,125
Yes, darling. I'm very happy, too.

248
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,541
Why didn't you inform me first?

249
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,625
<i>I wanted it to be a surprise</i>
<i>until you were at home.</i>

250
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,291
But then you found out already
from Instagram, didn't you?

251
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,375
<i>Yes. I've asked for permission</i>
<i>from my superior</i>

252
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,625
to take you for a checkup tomorrow.

253
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,500
<i>You don't need to, darling.</i>

254
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,125
<i>I called Dad immediately.</i>

255
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,500
<i>We're on the way</i>
<i>to the hospital now to do the checkup.</i>

256
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,791
<i>Besides, it wouldn't look good.</i>

257
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,791
<i>You've worked there for just a few weeks,</i>

258
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,041
but you're already asking for extra leave?

259
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,416
That's a good point.

260
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:03,541
<i>You don't need to worry.</i>
<i>If I need anything, Dad is here to help.</i>

261
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,458
-Right, Dad?
-Of course, dear.

262
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,000
I will always be there for you.

263
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,415
All right, then. I'll continue my work.

264
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,540
-Assalamu alaikum.
<i>-Waalaikumsalam</i>

265
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,415
What's the matter, bro?

266
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,958
Your face looks twisted all over.

267
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,833
Like a kite's thread.

268
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:25,958
You know, household things.

269
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
What's wrong with your house?

270
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,416
It's stilted?

271
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,916
It's not about ladders or things
in my house. Household stuff.

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,291
Wow. Sorry I set you off.

273
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,625
I can't say I have a household
to take care of yet,

274
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,708
but when it comes to women…

275
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm an expert.

276
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,125
Let me share something with you.

277
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:49,541
As soon as you get home,
hug your wife from behind.

278
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,291
And bite the back of her neck.

279
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,125
Then, you take her to the roof.

280
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,166
And you spoon her.

281
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,125
You think my wife is a cat?
You and your twisted mind…

282
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,708
Oh, Putra…

283
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,583
Already in over your head
with just one wife.

284
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,041
What will it be like when you have three
like I plan to have?

285
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:16,000
<i>Alhamdulillah. </i>The baby is healthy.

286
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,833
OK.

287
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:19,958
Nurse.

288
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,958
Ninis…

289
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,291
You must be happy.

290
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,000
OK. <i>Alhamdulillah,</i> everybody is healthy.

291
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:40,708
In the first trimester,
please take care of her food intake.

292
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,375
Don't ever drink soda.

293
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,958
Then the baby will grow healthily.

294
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:53,166
And don't do hard activities.

295
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,041
OK, Doctor,
I will look after what she eats.

296
00:18:56,125 --> 00:19:00,083
-I will monitor her activity, too.
-But don't get too possessive, sir.

297
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,166
Let her enjoy the pregnancy,
with full caution.

298
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,041
There's one more thing
I should remind you of.

299
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:10,541
During the first trimester,
the pregnancy is at its most fragile.

300
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:16,958
So, when you do the intimate activity,

301
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,666
do it slowly.

302
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,500
Don't get too aggressive,
for the sake of the baby.

303
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,333
Funny thing to say, Doc.
She is my daughter.

304
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,416
-She's your daughter? Oh…
-Yes.

305
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,666
What a great dad. He accompanied you
all the way here. Where's the husband?

306
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,208
Her husband's still at work.
That's why I'm taking her.

307
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,416
Very well, repeat what I said to him.

308
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,541
-We will, Doc.
-I will tell him.

309
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,250
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Waalaikumsalam.

310
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,416
How is it, Nis?
How far along is the pregnancy?

311
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,666
<i>Alhamdulillah,</i>
it's eight weeks old, darling.

312
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,166
From now on, you must--

313
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,166
Look after her intake and health.

314
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,291
One more thing.

315
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,125
Don't keep checking on her.

316
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
-Abort it!
<i>-Astaghfirullah,</i> mother!

317
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,291
What are you saying?

318
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,125
Ilham,
you're the evilest man in the world.

319
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,166
Grandma!

320
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,250
All this time,
I've been very patient with you.

321
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,250
Dad never makes mistakes!

322
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,083
He is the most responsible man
in this house.

323
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,375
The evilest person in this house…

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,250
is you.

325
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,625
You dare to speak up to me now?

326
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,375
Nis…

327
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,208
Your child is an illegitimate child!

328
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,458
Because your marriage is not valid
according to the religion.

329
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,458
Your dad here

330
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,791
is not your valid custodian,
don't you know that?

331
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,833
Mother, enough.

332
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,833
Grandma!

333
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:49,000
THE DEPARTED
YOYOH SUMARNI DAUGHTER OF SUDARMAN

334
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I heard her last words, Dad.

335
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,791
Is it true that I'm not your daughter?

336
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,458
Morning, Dad.

337
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,875
I've made your favorite dish,
chicken soup.

338
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,291
Good morning.

339
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,000
Let me prepare it for you.

340
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,625
Thank you.

341
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,125
Where are you having
your seminar today, Dad?

342
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,125
Bandung.

343
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,250
For how long?

344
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,416
Two weeks.

345
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,750
That's quite long.

346
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,958
I'll prepare some snacks.

347
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,708
You can nibble on them during the ride.

348
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:55,000
Jakarta to Bandung is quite far, and
there's traffic jams to consider, too.

349
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,541
Have you packed your clothes?

350
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,291
I'll put them in your luggage.

351
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,291
Thank you, Nis.

352
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,125
-Please put this in the car.
-Yes, sir.

353
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,333
Please be careful, Dad.

354
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:26,708
Nis.

355
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,458
You're the only one I have left
that I love.

356
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,541
It will be like that forever.

357
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,416
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Waalaikumsalam.

358
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,708
Are you all right, Nis?

359
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,208
Yes, I am.

360
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,583
Nis, is this your real mother?

361
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:12,041
-I don't know for sure yet, Lit.
-She's pretty.

362
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,208
Just like you.

363
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:23,041
Looking back, my mom passed away
due to cervical cancer.

364
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,750
Maybe that's why they adopted me.

365
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:33,041
And the way Grandma Yos treated me…
was so different.

366
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,375
That's impossible, Nis.

367
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,166
Throughout her life,

368
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,541
Grandma Yos loved
and took good care of you,

369
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,541
even though she was overprotective
and a bit annoying.

370
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,500
That's what makes me confused.

371
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:54,291
Have you asked your dad
who your real parents were?

372
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,916
No, I have not.

373
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,916
I didn't have the guts to ask.

374
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm afraid that if I ask that,
my dad will get sad.

375
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,250
And I've promised myself
not to make Dad sad and disappointed.

376
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,291
He's been very kind to me, Lit.

377
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,750
You're right about that.

378
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,541
But do you guys recall…

379
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:24,916
during the wedding vows back then,

380
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,708
Grandma Yos got hysterical.

381
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,958
She said your marriage was not valid.

382
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,958
Maybe that was a sign.

383
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:36,583
She wanted to reveal the truth
for your sake, Nis.

384
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:37,708
That is correct.

385
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,041
But we ignored her, right?

386
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,958
We thought that she was being possessed.

387
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:47,541
Maybe that's the case
because before she passed away,

388
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,125
she said that
my child is an illegitimate child.

389
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,750
An offspring of an invalid wedding.

390
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,583
She might be trying to do that.

391
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:59,416
Lita, what are you saying?
I'll slam your mouth shut.

392
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,875
I'm being serious. Listen closely.

393
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,875
I once attended a sermon.

394
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:08,958
One of the conditions
for a marriage to be considered valid

395
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,458
according to Islamic law

396
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,958
is to have a guardian present.

397
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:19,958
If your dad is not a valid custodian,

398
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:23,916
as long as you don't know the truth,
you're not committing a sin.

399
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,875
However, if you do know,

400
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,375
then your wedding is not valid

401
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,125
and you have to remarry,

402
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,333
this time accompanied by
a valid custodian.

403
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:37,875
With your real father,

404
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:40,333
an uncle from your real mother's side,

405
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,333
or a legal custodian you appoint

406
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,916
based on a request from your real mother.

407
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,791
If you and Putra don't do that,
you are both committing a sin.

408
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,875
Your marriage is not valid.

409
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,833
And that's exactly what Grandma Yos said.

410
00:28:56,916 --> 00:29:00,833
It's not like you to be right.
Did you drink Zamzam water recently?

411
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,041
Such a nuisance!

412
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,291
It's you who drank hand wash water.

413
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:09,000
But, this is the real deal.
You must know and understand it.

414
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,041
Just so you know,
I often go to religious lectures.

415
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:18,125
What lectures? You attend
to catch the eyes of the boys there.

416
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,458
What are you saying, Rel?
Stop being a know-it-all.

417
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,916
But you're not wrong about the boys.

418
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,166
Oh, just quit it.

419
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,916
It might not be true about Grandma Yos.

420
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,583
Let's change the subject.

421
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,958
So, how is life after marriage?
Is it nice?

422
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:39,458
-Go ahead, tell us!
-You go get married and find out.

423
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:44,458
-Tell me how to start?
-You can attend lectures like I did.

424
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,166
See, she does attend lectures
for the boys.

425
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,166
She was searching for the best catch.

426
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,250
-You'll then do the introductions.
-Yes. We'll get introduced.

427
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:00,625
-All right, then, Miss Know-It-All!
-I know all the tricks in the book!

428
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,208
RUMOR SAYS
ANNISA SANTOSA'S MARRIAGE IS INVALID.

429
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,083
SHE'S HAVING AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD.

430
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,416
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO?

431
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,125
JUST BECAUSE YOUR LIFE IS MEANINGLESS,
DON'T MAKE SLANDEROUS COMMENTS,

432
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:30,000
ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW.

433
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,666
Nis! Are you all right?

434
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,000
What's wrong, Nis?

435
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,583
I want to look for my real parents.

436
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:07,916
We will do that.
Later, after our child is born.

437
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,958
Darling!

438
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,458
Our marriage is not valid.
Our relationship is not halal anymore.

439
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,125
We can't mix freely again.

440
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,166
What are you talking about?
Go back to sleep.

441
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,208
Darling!

442
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:23,000
What we're doing now
is committing something unlawful.

443
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,541
How could you say that?

444
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,083
We didn't know that your dad
was not your valid custodian.

445
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,500
If we don't remarry soon,

446
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,541
this child will turn out to be
what Grandma said it was.

447
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,666
So what is it you want?

448
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,916
I want to find my real parents.

449
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:43,916
I want to find my valid custodian so that
our relationship will be completely halal.

450
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,375
Then this child
won't be called an illegitimate child.

451
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,916
-Excuse me, brother…
-Yes?

452
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,791
Do you know which way
Suka Bobo village is?

453
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,541
Suka Bobo village?

454
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,291
Go across the road, then head straight.

455
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,250
-Over there?
-Yes. Straight ahead.

456
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,208
-Thank you, brother.
-You're welcome.

457
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:46,583
-Do you know…?
-I don't.

458
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,125
-Thanks. Excuse me, sir.
-You're welcome.

459
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,250
Excuse us, brother. Do you know this lady?

460
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,666
-No we don't.
-Thank you, brother.

461
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,958
Thank you.

462
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,583
SUKA BOBO VILLAGE

463
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:54,250
Excuse me, sis.
Do you know the lady in this photo?

464
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:59,625
-I'm afraid I don't know her.
-Thank you, sis.

465
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:00,541
Excuse me.

466
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,458
It's raining. We must hurry.

467
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,375
Assalamu alaikum.

468
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,125
Assalamu alaikum.

469
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,333
What is it, brother? Can I help you?

470
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:42,041
It's rare that someone greets me
like that in this place.

471
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,958
I bet you went to an Islamic school.

472
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,750
-How many hours do you want the room for?
-Why do you have hourly rates?

473
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,750
You won't be able to do it
for 24 hours, will you?

474
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,958
If you can, be my guest.
There's plenty of rooms.

475
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,916
Brother, we are husband and wife!

476
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,041
Watch your mouth
or thunder may strike you.

477
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,500
Why are you getting so annoyed?

478
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,916
Here's the key.
The rate is 400,000 per night.

479
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,500
Here you go. Come, Nis.

480
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,000
So fierce!

481
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,083
At least he paid.

482
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,125
Oh, my…

483
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:27,958
This is because of
that Islamic school student.

484
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,666
I shouldn't bother him.
Better go back to bed.

485
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,750
How could that thunder come
all of a sudden?

486
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,833
What do you think you're doing?

487
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,666
-Get down from the bed!
-What is it, Nis?

488
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,791
Your place is on the couch.

489
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,541
I sleep on the bed. Alone.

490
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,125
How could that be? What wrong have I done?

491
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,500
We are husband and wife.

492
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,000
I'll move to another room
if you won't sleep on the couch.

493
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:22,500
No, don't do that.
OK, I'll sleep on the couch.

494
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,458
Here.

495
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,458
Nis, you're still my wife.

496
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,916
Why can't I touch you
just because of one new fact?

497
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,583
You know already.

498
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,583
Our marriage is not valid.

499
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,666
We cannot freely mix.

500
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,791
It's forbidden to intimately interact.

501
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:49,125
How long must I be in this situation?

502
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,875
I can't suppress it.

503
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:55,333
Until we remarry!

504
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,250
Fast if you can't suppress it.

505
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,083
Now I'm annoyed.

506
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,000
There's hardly any space to sleep.

507
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,375
No news is worth reading.
It's all fabricated.

508
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,750
A hoax.

509
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,000
No one is in favor of the people.

510
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,833
Brother?

511
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,166
-Brother!
-Oh my! Thunder again!

512
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,625
What is it, brother?

513
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,750
Do you know this lady?

514
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,375
No, brother.

515
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,041
OK, thank you.

516
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,500
Aye-aye, brother.

517
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:43,125
That's some kind of magic the guy has.
Thunder accompanies him everywhere.

518
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,958
Could he be a descendant
of a thunder warrior?

519
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,125
Mother.

520
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,583
Pretty child.

521
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:03,500
Lovely child.

522
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,791
-Your mom loves you.
-Excuse me, sister.

523
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:10,166
I'd like to ask.
Do you know the lady in this photo?

524
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,458
Let me see.

525
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:15,375
-What's her name?
-I don't know, sis.

526
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,166
How can that be?

527
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,833
One needs to know a name first
before finding the person.

528
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,916
All I know is that
she's a Jaipongan dancer.

529
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,125
You're kidding, right?

530
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:33,416
No Jaipongan dancers
will be hanging around in broad daylight.

531
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,416
You won't find one.

532
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,000
If you want to find meatball sellers
or tofu sellers, that's one thing.

533
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:42,791
But Jaipongan dancers
only come out at night.

534
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,125
Hey, cut it out.

535
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:50,250
As you can see, the father can only breed.
Later, he'll be nowhere to be found.

536
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,708
-Stop making noise.
-OK, sis. Thank you.

537
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,666
You're welcome. Wait a second…

538
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,541
If you want to see Jaipongan dancers…

539
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:03,000
See that place? They usually
hang out there on Saturday nights.

540
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,250
Check it out.

541
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:08,416
-Thank you so much, sis.
-My pleasure.

542
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,958
We'll go get ice cream later.

543
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,541
Go get your sister.

544
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:15,125
No need.

545
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,208
-Mineral water delivery.
-Hi.

546
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,125
Come in, brother.

547
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:32,541
-Why are you late today?
-I had so many orders.

548
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,958
Nis, let's call it for today.

549
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,666
It's raining.

550
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,541
You shouldn't get too tired.
Think of the baby.

551
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,958
It's OK. I can still walk.

552
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,791
Very well.

553
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,625
Get some rest. I need to go to the toilet.

554
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:19,333
<i>-Astaghfirullah!</i>
-Are you looking for someone?

555
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,375
Can I see who you're looking for?

556
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,083
Rinda Kumalasari?

557
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,541
You know her?

558
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,583
A Jaipongan maestro.

559
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,791
Can you take me to her?

560
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,958
Who was that man with you?

561
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,791
He's nobody. Just a friend.

562
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:55,083
I can take you to her.

563
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,916
On one condition.

564
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,166
What's that?

565
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,000
Don't come with him.

566
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,791
-All right.
-Come on your own.

567
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,916
Do you see the house on the corner?

568
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,750
Meet me there at eleven tonight.

569
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,250
I'm going now.

570
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,375
What was he up to?

571
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,541
I asked him about this photo.

572
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:30,458
Did he know her?

573
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:35,166
Darling, let's go back to the hotel.
It's getting late.

574
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,458
Let's find some girls,
and then we'll party.

575
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,375
There's one. Hey, sweetie!

576
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,125
Look, she's running.

577
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,208
Gosh.

578
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,958
Come in.

579
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,458
Please, come in.

580
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,916
Take a seat.

581
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:08,333
No need to rush. Let's chill first.

582
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,791
We'll have a good time.

583
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,833
Just tell me where Rinda is!

584
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,250
Behave yourself!

585
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,625
Don't you dare treat women
disrespectfully.

586
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:52,083
Women should be protected and guarded.

587
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,625
You got that?

588
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,625
I was just pulling a prank.

589
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,750
Please forgive my friend.

590
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,791
Take a seat.

591
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,291
Please, sit down.

592
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,791
Why did you tell me to come here?

593
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,625
I don't have much time.
Tell me where Rinda is!

594
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,291
Calm down.

595
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:17,250
You'll get high blood pressure.

596
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,500
Take it easy.

597
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,291
I think I've seen you before.

598
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,000
But where exactly?

599
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,875
You're the musician
with those absurd songs.

600
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:39,333
She's a fan of my work.

601
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:42,750
I told my friend to lead you here

602
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:46,166
because I need input
for my religious song.

603
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,000
Since you look like a religious person,

604
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:52,208
I'd like you to listen to my song.

605
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,916
I'm sorry, I don't have time.

606
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,375
My life is at stake.

607
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,708
I'll listen to your song later,

608
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,500
but right now
I need to know where Rinda is.

609
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,500
Hold on.
What business do you have with Rinda?

610
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,916
I'd like to learn to dance.

611
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,958
Who wants to learn
Jaipongan dance nowadays?

612
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,875
You should learn modern dance instead.

613
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:17,500
-What's wrong with Jaipongan dance?
-No.

614
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:20,458
Relax. Chill.

615
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:24,125
It's your human right to learn to dance.

616
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,875
Protected by the laws.

617
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,916
Go ahead. Learn to dance. Chill.

618
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,041
I'm just amused someone still wants
to learn Jaipongan dance.

619
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,041
Go ahead. Tell me where Rinda is.

620
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:40,125
OK, but you must promise

621
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:42,583
you will listen to my songs.

622
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:47,375
Rinda usually hangs around in the hall
on the eastern side.

623
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,083
Go ahead. You'll find her there.

624
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,500
Are you all right, Nis?

625
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,125
Calm down.

626
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,541
Calm down, please.

627
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:00,541
Nothing immoral was being done.

628
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,416
Everything is in order. Just chill.

629
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Everything in order, am I right?

630
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:08,125
-Yes. Thanks for the information.
-Relax.

631
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,916
I'll be on my way. Assalamu alaikum.

632
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,791
Waalaikumsalam, pretty girl.

633
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,625
How silly of you, back then.

634
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,083
I was just trying my luck.

635
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:24,916
Nis, how could you leave
without telling me?

636
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,541
Please forgive me, darling.

637
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,666
Where are we going?

638
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
<i>Tanjung flower</i>

639
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:11,500
<i>Tanjung flower</i>

640
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:16,666
<i>Greatly desired</i>

641
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:23,541
<i>Oh, my</i>

642
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:28,375
<i>The city of Bandung</i>

643
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:34,708
<i>The city of Bandung is very beautiful</i>

644
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:40,000
<i>Oh, my, Tanjung flower</i>

645
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:46,041
<i>It blooms and falls</i>

646
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:51,750
<i>We must respect</i>

647
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:57,333
<i>Respect women's honor</i>

648
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,333
I'll get changed.

649
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:19,500
-Thank you, everyone. I'll be on my way.
-Thank you, sis.

650
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,041
Nis…

651
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,000
Sum…

652
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,583
Sumireh…

653
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:59,208
You're pregnant again.

654
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:02,958
Where did your husband go?

655
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:06,708
He's not coming back, is he?

656
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:10,625
Poor girl.

657
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:15,791
I bet your husband
has married another woman.

658
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,166
Poor girl.

659
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,916
Darling, dear…

660
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,750
Come.

661
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,375
Let's go in, Sum.

662
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,916
Sumireh.

663
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:59,833
Nis, why are we stalking her?

664
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,375
We should've approached her.

665
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,333
You should tell her who you really are.

666
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,666
It's not that easy.

667
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,458
For 18 years, I never knew

668
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,750
that I had a different mother.

669
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,416
She might not actually be my real mother.

670
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,958
I've been reconsidering.

671
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,541
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

672
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,500
What are you saying?
You've got this far and you want to stop?

673
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,375
Nis.

674
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,166
The person you've been looking for
is in front of you.

675
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,958
You really want to miss the opportunity?

676
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:41,833
You think that by talking like that,

677
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,666
you can help calm my uneasiness?

678
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:46,166
Help me find a solution.

679
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:54,125
To Suka Bobo!

680
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,916
Dominoes!

681
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:58,291
-Here.
-To Suka Bobo!

682
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,333
Nis. What are we doing here?

683
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:15,125
Last stop. We've reached the terminal.

684
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,541
We have arrived.

685
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,250
-Last stop. The terminal.
-Hurry up.

686
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,458
Wait for me.

687
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,500
-Ouch!
-What? How come…?

688
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:26,291
Why are Lita and Aurel here?

689
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,125
Don't ask too much.

690
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:29,125
Trust me on this.

691
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:30,541
-Come.
-Hey.

692
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,666
-There's Ninis.
-Hi.

693
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,916
Ninis.

694
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:41,791
To Suka Bobo. Bobo?

695
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:44,708
Dominoes!

696
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:45,958
Sweetie, going to Bobo?

697
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:49,250
Smart-ass! You should be working
instead of sleeping.

698
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:54,041
-So feisty!
-Cool it. Don't you dare!

699
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:55,333
This is my friend!

700
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:57,625
Anyone to Cibobo?

701
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:00,416
Your mother's place is still far, Nis?

702
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:06,500
-I'm thirsty.
-I have mineral water, Ta.

703
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,791
Here you go. Have some water.

704
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,083
Drink a lot of water.

705
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:17,500
-It's good mineral water. Natural.
-Thank you.

706
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:35,250
You can do it.

707
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,291
You can.

708
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,875
Assalamu alaikum.

709
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,625
Assalamu alaikum.

710
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,083
-Waalaikumsalam.
-Excuse us, ma'am.

711
00:53:57,625 --> 00:54:00,708
Does Miss Rinda Kumalasari live here?

712
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:03,833
Oh my God. Ninis' mom is so pretty.

713
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,416
Who is Ninis?

714
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:09,125
I'm sorry, ma'am.

715
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:12,166
What my friend meant is,
you resemble our lecturer.

716
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,250
Her name is Miss Ninis.
You are both pretty.

717
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,291
-Am I right?
-Right.

718
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:19,500
We're students
from the University of Jakarta, ma'am.

719
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:25,208
We're doing some research
for our field study.

720
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:26,958
Are you Miss Rinda Kumalasari?

721
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,625
I'm sorry. You've got the wrong address.

722
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:37,625
Wow. I wasn't expecting that.

723
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:41,958
You were so overzealous in asking.
That must've ticked her off.

724
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,458
-I didn't say anything wrong, right?
<i>-Sure </i>you didn't.

725
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,958
Two, three, four,

726
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:55,166
five, six, seven

727
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,541
and eight.

728
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,958
One, two…

729
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:00,875
Gosh, so many mosquitoes.

730
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:04,041
The mosquitoes here are so aggressive.

731
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:07,000
-They keep biting like crazy.
-You can say that again.

732
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:10,750
One, two, three…

733
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:14,291
-The bites have turned red.
-Gosh, it's raining.

734
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:21,875
That's it for today.
We'll continue tomorrow.

735
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,625
Go approach her.

736
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,833
-Go on.
-You wait here.

737
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:44,291
Ma'am.

738
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:47,375
I know your name is Rinda Kumalasari.

739
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:51,583
I'm humbly begging you,
please let us research in your place.

740
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,333
What are you going to do here?

741
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,958
We want to study.

742
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,583
If you want to study, do it on campus.
My place is not a campus.

743
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:03,833
Ma'am…

744
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,333
Nissa!

745
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:17,666
-Nissa!
-Go after her. Quick!

746
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:27,541
-Ma'am!
-Putra.

747
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,916
Putra, wait for us.

748
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:33,708
We've come all the way to see you
to learn how to dance, ma'am.

749
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,291
We've sacrificed a lot to reach here.

750
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:38,000
That's your problem.

751
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:41,333
-I really want to learn dancing.
-Jaipongan dance is an erotic dance.

752
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:42,416
Take a look at yourself.

753
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,458
But I really want to learn, ma'am.

754
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:47,416
I want to be like you.

755
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,375
You don't know

756
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:55,458
how I've waited 18 years
for this opportunity.

757
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,041
Come…

758
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,166
Bring her to my house.

759
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,708
Hurry.

760
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,083
What is wrong with your friend?

761
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,666
She's expecting a child, ma'am.

762
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:33,916
She's pregnant?

763
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:37,833
What is it?

764
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,750
And where is her husband?

765
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,541
-I'm…
-We don't know where the husband is.

766
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:45,583
That's right.

767
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:46,708
You mean to say…?

768
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:48,708
Ninis was abandoned by her husband.

769
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:53,000
Such a shameless guy. A despicable man.

770
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,833
Leaving after having fun.

771
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:57,833
Watch it.

772
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:00,708
Stop poking me. It hurts.

773
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:05,875
Very well. Your friend can stay here.

774
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:08,291
Let her rest.
You can all spend the night, too.

775
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:10,083
You mean we can spend the night here?

776
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:13,791
-Are you serious, ma'am?
-Yes. It's OK.

777
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:17,666
-<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>
-<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

778
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:20,000
Thank you, ma'am.

779
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,750
You're awake already?

780
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:46,625
Have some tea.

781
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:59,541
How far along is your pregnancy?

782
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:09,041
If you're in the first trimester,
you shouldn't get exhausted.

783
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:11,791
You shouldn't get stressed, either.

784
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,041
Otherwise, the baby will feel it, too.

785
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,875
Let's have breakfast.
The others have had theirs.

786
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,416
But you will teach us to dance, right?

787
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:27,708
On one condition.

788
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,250
Don't call me "ma'am."

789
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:30,958
Call me "sis."

790
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:34,625
Yes, sis.

791
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,708
DANCE SCHOOL

792
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:55,875
Jaipongan dance is a symbol
of women's resistance and liberation.

793
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:10,375
Because men can't be allowed
to step over women.

794
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:24,958
Ouch!

795
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:29,041
-What's wrong, Ta?
-You need to ask? I'm in pain. I fell.

796
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,583
Do you really have to ask?

797
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:32,708
-Get up.
-How could you fall?

798
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:35,916
-Stop grumbling and help me instead.
-You should've kept to easy moves.

799
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,958
Are you OK?

800
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,833
-I'm OK. I just tripped over.
-You want to keep practicing?

801
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:41,916
-Yes, sis.
-We'll do the easy moves.

802
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:45,958
-Try not to keep falling.
-We'll take it slow.

803
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:52,833
<i>Assalamu alaikum.</i>

804
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,166
How are you, Nis?

805
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,083
<i>Waalaikumsalam.</i>
<i>Thankfully, everything's fine, Dad.</i>

806
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,291
What about you?
You're through with the training?

807
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:04,250
Yes, I am. I'm in a coffee shop now.

808
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:07,791
But it seems that
I can't go home to Jakarta yet.

809
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:10,083
I have to go to Sukabumi.
I have an event there.

810
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,541
It's OK, Dad.

811
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,000
By the way, I'm not at home either.

812
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:17,458
How come? Where are you?

813
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:21,125
I've been in Majalengka
for the last few days.

814
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:23,375
-I'm taking dance practice.
-How come?

815
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,291
Why are you suddenly practicing dancing?

816
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:29,666
I don't know.
Maybe it's what the baby wants.

817
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:34,250
I'm also accompanying
Lita and Aurel in their field studies.

818
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:37,333
I am tagging along
and learning to dance at the same time.

819
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,000
Putra is here.

820
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,166
You don't need to worry.

821
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,625
I see. OK, then.

822
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:44,208
By the way, Nis…

823
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:49,500
I want you to join me at a seminar.
As co-speaker.

824
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,708
You can share your experience

825
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:55,666
about marrying young
and preparing for motherhood.

826
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,666
<i>So others will be inspired.</i>
<i>What do you say?</i>

827
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:02,958
OK. I'd like to ask my friend
to come and perform there.

828
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:07,083
She's a dancer? OK, you may.

829
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:12,333
<i>But remember to look after your pregnancy.</i>
<i>Don't strain yourself.</i>

830
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:16,708
If your mother were still around,
she would have made your favorite food.

831
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:18,458
You mean chicken in coconut gravy?

832
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:19,500
Yes.

833
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:23,083
But my longing for her
is fulfilled by being here.

834
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:27,166
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>
Are you staying in a villager's house?

835
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,958
Yes. She's a dancer.

836
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:32,500
She's very kind to me.

837
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,833
I feel like I'm in my own home.

838
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:40,000
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

839
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:42,333
<i>Very well, take care.</i>

840
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:44,208
<i>Give my regards to Putra.</i>

841
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,166
I have to go now.

842
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,666
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Waalaikumsalam.

843
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,750
Good morning, ma'am.

844
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,041
What a delicious smell.

845
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,708
You were saying?

846
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:02,916
I'm sorry. Sis.

847
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,125
I keep forgetting
because you are like my own mother.

848
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:14,083
If my daughter were still alive…

849
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,166
she'd be your age by now.

850
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:20,166
You had a daughter?

851
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,041
She might be happy in paradise now.

852
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,750
Your daughter passed away?

853
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:38,875
She was an unborn child.

854
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,875
Had she lived…

855
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,750
she'd have grown up
to become a beautiful girl like you.

856
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,666
-Let's bring the food inside.
-OK.

857
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,833
If I might ask you…

858
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:25,833
Where is your husband now?

859
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,500
The day of birth

860
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,958
should have been

861
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:39,208
the happiest day of my life.

862
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:44,416
I have never had a family before.

863
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:48,083
And that day, my daughter was born.

864
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:53,083
I was also supposed to have become
the wife of a person I loved.

865
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:04,666
I didn't even care that
people said I had an illegitimate child.

866
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:10,291
What mattered was, I didn't get pregnant
because of prostitution.

867
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:13,708
And I was not a prostitute.

868
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,916
I knew I was wrong,
getting pregnant out of wedlock.

869
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:28,125
But I made a promise to repent
and take care of my daughter.

870
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:30,833
So that when she was born,

871
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:33,458
she would not repeat
her parents' mistakes.

872
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:45,708
But fate had other plans.

873
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,875
My daughter passed away.

874
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,791
And he left, I don't know where.

875
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:02,291
The day turned into
the saddest day of my life.

876
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:19,500
You've made me sad…

877
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:25,375
Therefore you must look after
your baby well.

878
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:28,791
The baby will be
the most precious thing in your life.

879
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,041
But, sis…

880
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,666
Why did he leave you?

881
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:37,875
I don't know.

882
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,041
Maybe he found happiness
with another woman.

883
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,000
If I may ask…

884
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,875
What is your husband's name?

885
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,541
It's not important, who he is.

886
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:56,000
What is important is,
I'm not alone anymore.

887
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:59,541
There are children in the dance school
that I have to take care of

888
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,000
so they don't become sex workers
like their mothers.

889
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:06,541
-Come on.
-Yeah, wait a minute.

890
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:09,250
We didn't know you guys were here.

891
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,416
You're not interrupting.
Come join us to eat.

892
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,250
-Is it OK?
-Yes. Have some food.

893
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,708
Come. The food is ready.

894
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,291
-I want it.
-You want some?

895
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,750
Come, we'll eat together.

896
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:28,625
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

897
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,125
So, this is the place?

898
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:36,125
-It's beautiful.
-Nis.

899
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,291
Do you know what date it is today?

900
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:43,041
November 28th, I think. Why?

901
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:47,916
Too bad it's November 28th
instead of October 28th.

902
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:50,958
What's happening on October 28th?

903
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,750
October 28th is Youth Vow Day.

904
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,250
And I want to change it.

905
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,875
Change it into what?

906
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:02,041
I want to change it
to the day of the vow that I love you.

907
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:05,750
What are you saying? That's so cheesy.

908
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,000
You need to loosen up a bit.

909
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,416
Think of the baby.

910
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:14,375
He's stressed
because you're so uptight and tense.

911
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,250
Are you hungry?

912
01:08:17,332 --> 01:08:18,500
I am.

913
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:21,666
-Let's have some fried rice.
-OK.

914
01:08:22,957 --> 01:08:25,041
Two portions of fried rice, sir.

915
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,666
-Look, Rinda, a photo site.
-Come and take a photo here!

916
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,500
-Let's take our photos together.
-Take mine first.

917
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:32,791
Take our photos first
Then I'll take yours.

918
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,041
-You want me to take the photos?
-We'll take turns.

919
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,416
-Promise you'll take mine later?
-I will. Let's do it!

920
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,166
-Sis, strike a pose.
-One, two, three.

921
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:42,207
Rel, wait a second.

922
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,957
Sis, please put on a happy face.
A cheerful, funny, crazy face.

923
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:47,207
-I'm shy.
-Well, don't be.

924
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,916
-Look at her.
-Make a face like this, sis.

925
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,166
-Put two hands together,
-You'll look cute.

926
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,750
-One, two, three.
-Smile.

927
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:58,125
-It's in focus.
-Let me see.

928
01:08:58,207 --> 01:09:00,916
-Like a real photographer's work.
-Let's share it on Instagram.

929
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,375
Yes, let's do it.

930
01:09:02,457 --> 01:09:04,625
I'm getting more confused, darling.

931
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:07,000
Why is that?

932
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:10,416
Can it be…

933
01:09:11,082 --> 01:09:13,832
that Rinda is not my real mother?

934
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:17,832
She said her daughter had passed away.

935
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:19,957
Well…

936
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,707
I have been asking the locals.

937
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:25,707
They give different answers.

938
01:09:27,082 --> 01:09:29,125
Some say her daughter passed away.

939
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,166
Others say her husband took her.

940
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,707
I'm not that curious anymore.

941
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,666
Why don't you ask your dad directly?

942
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,625
It will be more solid.

943
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:45,375
I can feel

944
01:09:45,457 --> 01:09:48,250
there's a big secret
that Dad has been keeping from me.

945
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:52,166
A secret that has left a painful mark.

946
01:09:54,207 --> 01:09:55,708
I can see it.

947
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,875
And I fear I will reopen the pain.

948
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:04,083
I fear I will disappoint and hurt Dad.

949
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,291
Wow.

950
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:22,666
So many photos of Ninis.

951
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:44,250
My name is Ilham Santosa
May I know your name?

952
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,250
Rinda.

953
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,208
Smooth.

954
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,250
Drink the milk, Rin.

955
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,125
Drink it all.

956
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:39,000
You really sure you don't want ice cream?

957
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:40,791
No, thanks, I'm on diet.

958
01:12:40,875 --> 01:12:44,375
Your body is so small,
and yet you're on diet?

959
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:48,708
Ta, look. Rinda is there by herself.

960
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,583
She's just sitting silently,
like someone with debts.

961
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:53,833
-Let's sit with her.
-Let's go.

962
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:03,166
-Hi there, Rinda.
-Sitting here all alone.

963
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,916
Let us sit with you,
so there's three of us.

964
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,875
-I mean, four of us…
-What do you mean by "four"?

965
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:13,458
You surprised me.
I wasn't expecting anyone.

966
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,333
I'm out for some fresh air.

967
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:18,875
-I see.
-What are you doing out here?

968
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:22,166
We just came from the stalls.
Getting some refreshments.

969
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:25,041
-You want some ice cream?
-No, thanks.

970
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:27,708
-You shouldn't have offered yours.
-This one's all I have.

971
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:30,583
Lita, Aurel, I want to ask…

972
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:32,041
Where is Nissa's husband?

973
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,916
Oh. You mean Putra?

974
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,750
I have no idea. He's probably gone
to the city to buy milk.

975
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:40,125
Milk for the pregnant one.

976
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,333
-Lita…
-What is it?

977
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,833
-Ta…
-What is it? Tell me.

978
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:46,875
You know…

979
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,958
It's OK.
You don't need to hide it anymore.

980
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:53,833
I know everything thanks to Instagram.

981
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:58,500
What is your real purpose in being here?

982
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:04,958
It's all right. Tell me.

983
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,875
I won't get mad even if you lied.

984
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:12,250
Putra is Ninis's husband, sis.

985
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:15,208
They got married young.
Her dad matched them.

986
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:18,458
A few days after Ninis got pregnant,
she realized

987
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,833
that their marriage is not legitimate.

988
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:25,208
Her dad, who gave her away at the wedding,

989
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,625
is not her real parent.

990
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:32,666
Does that mean Nissa is a foster child?

991
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,333
-Yes.
-Yes.

992
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:38,333
Her parents are not her real parents?

993
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:39,416
-Yes.
-Yes.

994
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:43,375
We'd been thinking
you were Ninis' real mother.

995
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:45,000
But it turns out

996
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,083
your daughter has died.

997
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,958
We assumed wrong.

998
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,375
-Didn't we.
-Right.

999
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:08,333
Where did you put the pendant?

1000
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:09,750
I don't know.

1001
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:13,208
Usually, I put it by the bed
every night after I wear it.

1002
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:16,250
I've been looking all over for it,
though, and I can't find it.

1003
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:39,583
-Nis, look at these photos.
-What photos?

1004
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,583
Dad…

1005
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,041
What does this mean, darling?

1006
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,958
Maybe it's true what the villagers said.

1007
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:53,541
Rinda's daughter is not dead.

1008
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,416
She was taken by her boyfriend instead.

1009
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,166
And the daughter… is me?

1010
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,375
You mean to say…

1011
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,125
I'm the child
of an illegitimate relationship?

1012
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:08,041
That's impossible, darling.

1013
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:10,416
My dad would not do
a cruel thing like that.

1014
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,958
But you can see for yourself.

1015
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:14,916
There are so many photos
of your dad in Rinda's possession.

1016
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,250
Look! A photo of Grandma Yos.

1017
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:20,000
It's impossible, darling.

1018
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:21,250
Nis!

1019
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,125
You can't keep on taking your dad's side.

1020
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:26,000
If your dad was right and not lying,

1021
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:28,125
he could've easily told the truth.

1022
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:32,958
Why did he choose to hide it instead?

1023
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:36,083
He doesn't dare
to discuss this matter at all.

1024
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:37,375
Darling.

1025
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:40,208
How could you be so impolite
as to accuse Dad like that?

1026
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:42,541
Dad never lies.

1027
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:44,958
He never disappoints me.

1028
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:48,333
He has done a lot for me.

1029
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:50,166
For us.

1030
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:55,458
And what have you done for me and my life?

1031
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:56,791
You never take me seriously.

1032
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:01,916
And I can never be a husband
who makes you respect him.

1033
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:05,041
Because I'm not your father.

1034
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,875
You keep praising him,

1035
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:09,625
and yet he couldn't tell the truth
to his own daughter.

1036
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:14,041
Is that what your ideal man is like?

1037
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:18,041
Just stop badmouthing my dad!

1038
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:19,541
Or else…

1039
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,833
Or else what?

1040
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:22,000
What will you do?

1041
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,500
You should think, Nis.

1042
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:30,666
Why did Grandma Yos say
our marriage was not valid

1043
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,291
in the middle of your pregnancy?

1044
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,625
She was trying to save us.

1045
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:37,291
She was trying to save you,

1046
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,250
and the baby in your womb.

1047
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:42,208
What have you done for her in return?

1048
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,541
Your dad is human.

1049
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:49,500
He could have made mistakes.

1050
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:50,750
He's not an angel.

1051
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,333
He might even…

1052
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:57,875
have been a bastard in the past.

1053
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:58,791
How dare you!

1054
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,750
One, two, three.

1055
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:43,791
And turn!

1056
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,083
Four, five, six,

1057
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:48,500
seven and eight.

1058
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,750
One, two, three.

1059
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:54,083
Four, five, six.

1060
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:56,916
Seven and eight. Shift to the left…

1061
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,750
Lina, what's the matter?

1062
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:05,583
Sis, may I spend the night here?

1063
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,375
-Stop crying…
-Come in.

1064
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,916
Sis, my father doesn't know
that I'm here, does he?

1065
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:21,791
Why shouldn't he know, Lin?

1066
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:23,750
I'm afraid, sis.

1067
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:26,916
My father gets angry with me all the time.

1068
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,708
And my mom used to beat me, too.

1069
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,958
You're safe here.

1070
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,250
Be calm, OK?

1071
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,625
Rinda and I are here for you.

1072
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:39,541
OK?

1073
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,833
Yes, sis…

1074
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,458
Get some sleep.

1075
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:57,833
<i>The night has come</i>

1076
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:04,000
<i>Go to sleep, my dear</i>

1077
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:09,833
<i>The prayer that follows</i>

1078
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:16,708
<i>All through the night</i>

1079
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:22,041
<i>Will put you sound asleep</i>

1080
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:28,458
<i>And soothe your heart</i>

1081
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:33,333
<i>Until the morning comes</i>

1082
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:38,833
<i>And we welcome its light</i>

1083
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:42,000
Whose song is that?

1084
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:43,708
That's my grandma's song.

1085
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:47,500
Every time I've gone to bed,
from I was a kid to adulthood,

1086
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,833
she sang me that song.

1087
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:53,916
She said that when I was in my mom's womb,

1088
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,958
my mom used to sing it to me.

1089
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:14,166
I can't stop thinking…

1090
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:17,583
How could Lina's father hurt her?
She's still a little child.

1091
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,083
Does this type of thing happen often?

1092
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,416
Sis?

1093
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,625
What's wrong with you?

1094
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:43,708
My daughter…

1095
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,583
You are my daughter.

1096
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:00,250
I thought you were gone, dear.

1097
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,375
It turns out you're still alive.

1098
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:14,041
I remember that song very well.

1099
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:18,833
I used to sing it during pregnancy.

1100
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,500
Mom…

1101
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:31,250
Am I… really your daughter?

1102
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,125
And if I'm your daughter…

1103
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,958
then who's my father?

1104
01:23:56,208 --> 01:24:00,208
Sir, don't forget. I've made
an appointment at eight o'clock tonight.

1105
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:03,333
-With Mr. Robby.
-You've made an appointment?

1106
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:04,333
Yes, sir.

1107
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,333
What's wrong with you?

1108
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,625
My schedule is full today.

1109
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:11,000
So… should I cancel it?

1110
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:14,166
Of course not. Once you make an
appointment, you must stick to it.

1111
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:17,666
All right, sir. The event will start soon.
Please take a seat.

1112
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:39,041
Where's my daughter
who has become an expert dancer?

1113
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:57,541
Excuse me, sir?

1114
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,791
Come to the briefing, and also,
we'll change your clothes.

1115
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,166
Is that it? After all that has happened,

1116
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,458
you'll just stay silent and leave?

1117
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:08,833
Why, Dad?

1118
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:12,083
Why have you been lying to me?

1119
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:20,041
All this time,
I've been following your words.

1120
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,125
I've done everything that you want.

1121
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:27,000
But what have you really done to me?

1122
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:33,208
You've shoved me into
the pit of sin that you dug.

1123
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:37,916
What kind of a father would do that?

1124
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:43,875
I'm pregnant, Dad.

1125
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:47,500
You had the heart to lie

1126
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:50,458
just for the sake of your image.

1127
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:54,541
You are cruel. You're a hypocrite.

1128
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,875
How could you do that?

1129
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:03,750
Eighteen years ago,
you told me my daughter had died,

1130
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:05,750
when in fact, you had taken her with you!

1131
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:07,958
Why?

1132
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:15,291
Answer, Dad! Answer!

1133
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:17,166
Are you OK?

1134
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,250
-Nis…
-Don't touch my daughter!

1135
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:23,833
Don't…

1136
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,666
Nis, be patient.

1137
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,541
Nis. Are you all right?

1138
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:36,083
Darling, forgive me…

1139
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:39,750
All this time, I've never listened to you.

1140
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:43,625
Forgive me

1141
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:47,000
for not being a good wife.

1142
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:50,333
Don't think about it, Nis. Don't be sad.

1143
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:53,250
The baby will be sad, too.

1144
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:59,250
Dad has been lying to me all this time.

1145
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:02,458
He's been lying…

1146
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:05,416
Take it easy, Nis. Calm down.

1147
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,500
Please be calm.

1148
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:12,000
Have patience, Nis.

1149
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:36,375
<i>All this time, I've made my penance.</i>

1150
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:40,291
Annisa, go change your clothes.

1151
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:45,208
<i>Have I lost all my rights</i>
<i>with regard to my beloved daughter?</i>

1152
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:47,791
<i>The clerics have decided…</i>

1153
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:50,125
that…

1154
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:53,583
if a child is borne out of wedlock,

1155
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:57,416
the father loses the right
to give her away as her guardian.

1156
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:02,833
<i>That is stated in our religious law.</i>

1157
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:12,583
So…

1158
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:15,916
what should I do?

1159
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,291
Have some patience.

1160
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,916
Reveal the truth.

1161
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,291
My daughter. You look so beautiful.

1162
01:29:26,083 --> 01:29:29,083
I take after my mother.

1163
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,166
I once told you…

1164
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:56,583
that I wanted
to be the best parent for you.

1165
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:02,208
I have failed.

1166
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:09,833
I've let you down.

1167
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:12,833
I've lied to you.

1168
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:16,000
I've ruined your future.

1169
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:21,333
I just want to say…

1170
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:27,666
please forgive me.

1171
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,500
Forgive me.

1172
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:41,458
Rinda.

1173
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:46,375
Please forgive me.

1174
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,666
I never meant to lie to you.

1175
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,208
At that time…

1176
01:30:58,833 --> 01:30:59,875
I was powerless.

1177
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:04,625
I'm sorry, father. I acted out of bounds.

1178
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:08,833
-I will take responsibility…
-Abort it!

1179
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:13,833
Leave the girl!
Don't you ever see her again!

1180
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:17,541
No, Father. I will take responsibility.

1181
01:31:17,625 --> 01:31:19,416
I won't add another sin to my conscience.

1182
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,041
I want to marry her.

1183
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:25,250
If you marry her, you are never
setting foot in this house again!

1184
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:29,166
And you'll never be considered
as my flesh and blood again, either.

1185
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,208
Got that!

1186
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:36,833
Do not ruin my reputation!

1187
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:39,750
It's a matter of tradition.

1188
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:46,250
You can't marry someone of questionable
origin, don't you understand that?

1189
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:55,458
-Do what has to be done, Doctor.
-Yes, sir.

1190
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:25,208
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There were abnormalities.

1191
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:28,000
We did our best, but…

1192
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:32,000
-What?
-I'm sorry.

1193
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:33,458
Doctor…

1194
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:05,208
Look after her as best as you can.

1195
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:10,250
Love her like your own.

1196
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:18,166
Inshallah, ma'am.

1197
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:29,333
Forgive me, Rinda.

1198
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,083
Ilham…

1199
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:51,000
A man's worth is seen…

1200
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:57,041
when he has to decide
his destination in life.

1201
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:02,208
Forgive me for what I have done, Rin.

1202
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,125
Nis. Nissa.

1203
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:10,208
Everyone is waiting downstairs.

1204
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,041
Nis.

1205
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:21,791
Come, Nis.

1206
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,375
Annisa…

1207
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,875
As women,

1208
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:43,833
sometimes we have to make peace
with our disappointments.

1209
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:50,083
But don't let anger reside
and grow in your heart.

1210
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,000
You are a good child, dear.

1211
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:57,250
Understand?

1212
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,750
Regarding the role of the custodian,

1213
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:13,041
it has been bestowed on me
as the magistrate guardian,

1214
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:16,291
due to the fact that
the mother of the bride

1215
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,083
has no male family members.

1216
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:19,166
Is that true?

1217
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:22,500
That's true, sir.

1218
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,416
Let's proceed.

1219
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:31,166
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

1220
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:35,958
Putra Al Fatih,
I hereby marry you to Annisa Santosa,

1221
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:37,750
daughter of Rinda Kumalasari,

1222
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:40,333
with a <i>mahr </i>of ten grams of jewelry

1223
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:43,208
and a set of worship equipment
paid in cash.

1224
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:46,333
I accept the marriage of Annisa Santosa
daughter of Rinda Kumalasari

1225
01:35:46,416 --> 01:35:48,750
with the <i>mahr </i>paid in cash.

1226
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:51,500
-How is it, honored witnesses?
-It's valid.

1227
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:25,541
Dad…

1228
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:29,541
Dad, forgive me.

1229
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:33,875
I overreacted.

1230
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:37,916
I forgot about all the good things
you have done for me.

1231
01:36:41,583 --> 01:36:47,333
If Allah forgives the sins
of his servants who repent,

1232
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:51,333
does a daughter have the right…

1233
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:56,541
to hate and reject her father
for his past sins?

1234
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:00,750
Forgive me, Dad.

1235
01:37:08,291 --> 01:37:10,333
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

1236
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:12,333
Allahu Akbar<i>.</i>

1237
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,750
O YOU WHO HAVE BELIEVED,
PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILIES

1238
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:28,750
FROM A FIRE WHOSE FUEL
IS PEOPLE AND STONES

1239
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:31,125
OVER WHICH ARE [APPOINTED] ANGELS,
HARSH AND SEVERE;

1240
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:33,416
THEY DO NOT DISOBEY ALLAH
IN WHAT HE COMMANDS THEM

1241
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,625
BUT DO WHAT THEY ARE COMMANDED.
[AT-TAHRIM - 66:6]

1242
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:44,708
Are you sure you want to marry
at this young age?

1243
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:45,750
Yes, sir.

1244
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,291
Are you really sure?

1245
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:49,250
Yes, I am.

1246
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:53,833
Are you really sure about your choice?
You're doing it without pressure?

1247
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:56,250
I'm 100 percent sure.

1248
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:59,625
I was searching for someone
who can protect and guard me.

1249
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:03,208
You're beating around the bush
too much, sir.

1250
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,250
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

1251
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:08,958
No, sir. No problem.

1252
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,833
Have you learned the prayer by heart?

1253
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:14,791
The prayer for that act?

1254
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:16,208
I know it by heart.

1255
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,708
I know it 100 percent, right, dear?

1256
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:23,750
I see. That's good then.

1257
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,166
You have experience, don't you, sir?
