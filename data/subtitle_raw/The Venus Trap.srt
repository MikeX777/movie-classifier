1
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:22,969
Bye. Thanks for the lift.
- See you.

2
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:30,164
When Kama-Puhaa had
become a young man,

3
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:33,799
he was to be sacrificed
on the altar of Pruna.

4
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,914
He was tied to stakes like a pig

5
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:42,604
and carried to the sacrifice altar by
eight men. But Kama-Puhaa managed to...

6
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:08,747
Are you from the bride's family?

7
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:11,853
I'm from the party service.

8
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,998
We're checking to see if all guests are
really enjoying themselves. - Enjoying?

9
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,691
The music, for instance,
is far too solemn.

10
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:24,589
That's music for an older generation.

11
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,567
After all he will turn 60, next year.

12
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:33,226
I'm his ex-wife.
Ex-wife number 1.

13
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:58,097
He's dependent and naughty
like a little child.

14
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,899
But he has a big heart.

15
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:06,463
My successors.

16
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:16,209
He's a womaniser.
I was his second wife.

17
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,108
The reason for divorce
was mental cruelty.

18
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:25,003
If you know what I mean.
But... he was an adorable sod.

19
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:30,352
He's a sadist without a conscience.

20
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:34,674
I regret that we're
just good friends now.

21
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,918
I'm number 4. He exhausted me sexually.

22
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,850
He didn't have
anything else on his mind!

23
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:44,106
But I simply couldn't deny him anything.

24
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:50,811
He was good to us all.
He's good to every woman.

25
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,590
Do you dance?
- No, my regrets.

26
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:46,064
What's your name?

27
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:49,073
Max.

28
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:53,198
You're not invited, are you?
I know all the guests.

29
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,276
Right. Will you have a drink
with me regardless?

30
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,070
And who are you calling
in the middle of the night?

31
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,958
You're asking like a mature woman.

32
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:10,551
I have a right to ask.
I'm the sister of the bride.

33
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:14,262
Have you been in love yet?

34
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:19,208
But it didn't make me
telephone at night.

35
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:22,095
You're lovesick.

36
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:25,091
I've fallen in love with
a woman I don't know.

37
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:27,530
With a woman you don't know?

38
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,794
Yes.

39
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:31,950
The other day, I wanted to order cinema
tickets and dialed the wrong number.

40
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:38,303
She only said one word: "Hello?"
And then "Sorry, wrong number."

41
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:42,931
I knew right away: This woman
is different from all others.

42
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,656
This is the woman of whom
I've been dreaming all my life.

43
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:52,993
Why aren't you looking for her?
You just need to really wish for it,

44
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,948
then you'll find her!

45
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:59,569
What will I get from you if I find her?

46
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:02,686
A kiss?

47
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,690
How old are you?

48
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:10,077
Will I get a kiss or won't I?

49
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,716
Alright. Deal.

50
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,668
Can you imagine meeting another man,
dropping everything, and starting over?

51
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:48,480
Do you sometimes feel that
your life is like walking on thin ice?

52
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:53,138
You're getting a chance to act
without inhibition or shame

53
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:56,363
and not be punished.
What will you do?

54
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:01,619
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

55
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,526
From eight till midnight.

56
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,760
Did we have a date or was I dreaming?

57
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:12,045
I was in a thunderstorm.
I had an accident.

58
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:16,641
My plane crashed.
What was your dream about?

59
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:21,976
I dreamt of festivities, balls, oysters,

60
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:26,389
drugs, alcohol, madness and excess.

61
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:32,181
I was a pearl.
A pearl on a tie pin.

62
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:35,339
A pearl on the tie pin of a prince.

63
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,919
Of a prince from Chiputi.

64
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,709
Are you having a tenderness attack?

65
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,284
You've got something to hide.

66
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:51,312
Be careful not to get caught.
Women sense things like that.

67
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,855
Is there some food left?

68
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:58,581
You've already had 200 grams
of meat today. That's enough.

69
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:02,272
Even German Shepherds get no more
than 200 grams of meat a day.

70
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,487
And you little Dachshund?

71
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:25,410
I'm tired now.

72
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,934
Tired, tired, tired, tired, tired.

73
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:38,012
All of a sudden,
I'm feeling very tired too.

74
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,499
You've had a nice supper

75
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,481
and now, you may harass me a little.

76
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:33,347
Now what's this?

77
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,338
Do you want to offend me?

78
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:41,197
When I arrive, I want to
see him in the royal position.

79
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,916
After all, my walk from the door
to the table was long enough!

80
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,259
That little scoundrel!

81
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,943
All day, he's been sitting in the dark
and now he's looking perplexed.

82
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:57,593
We'll tie a little bell around him,
so that I can hear him if he moves.

83
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,518
Such a small and soft
and crinkly animal!

84
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:08,024
I could get into trouble because of it!

85
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:12,499
My lease prohibits the keeping
of animals in the apartment.

86
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,519
We should set a mouse trap!

87
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,766
And now it's getting bigger too!

88
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,468
I can hardly look!

89
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,181
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

90
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:35,728
Disgusting!
Stop! Stop, stop!

91
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,614
Hermann! Hermann!

92
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:08,166
The psychiatrist is
going to be a little late.

93
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:12,688
Maybe you'd like to talk to the doctor
about your low blood pressure meanwhile!

94
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,777
The doctor's an internist!

95
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,260
A nice flat.

96
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:44,000
Is there something your husband
is particularly attached to?

97
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,571
I can't think of anything.

98
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,439
Isn't he attached to you?

99
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:54,785
What do you mean?

100
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,402
What I said.

101
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,362
I believe he's more attached to his dog.

102
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,863
I don't hear or see anything
from you anymore.

103
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,082
I feel neglected.

104
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,398
Why do you always take the night shifts?
- I can't sleep at night.

105
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,439
You can't sleep because you're thinking
about all the things you might miss!

106
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:40,429
Your husband has quite an audience.

107
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:47,183
He won't jump anyway. Those who
don't jump within 6 hours never do.

108
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:51,562
After six hours he
should be getting hungry.

109
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:54,222
You could cook something for him.

110
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:57,299
In any case,
you'll take care of him now.

111
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,400
Very well. I'll convince him to jump

112
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:02,579
and you'll patch him up
again afterwards.

113
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,360
Let him jump.

114
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,987
It's best for him.

115
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:13,736
The only thing stopping us
is the lack of courage.

116
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:16,085
He's showing it to all of us.

117
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:22,557
Give him an idea. Give him hope!

118
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,657
For what? I can't think of anything.

119
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,953
I don't know where you're getting
your unlimited optimism from.

120
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:32,073
Tomorrow, one of us
will be standing there.

121
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:36,859
The man has a right to kill himself.
- Offer him to jump in his place.

122
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,056
That will convince him.
But you're too cowardly for that.

123
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,796
Can I offer you something to drink?

124
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:46,262
Stay where you are.

125
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,780
If you come one step closer,
I'll finish myself off.

126
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,932
Are you crazy?

127
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,376
You could fall to your death!

128
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,002
I'll jump in your place!

129
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,713
I'm serious. I'll jump
and you go back, alright?

130
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:09,947
You're overestimating
your psychological skills.

131
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:24,908
Alright.

132
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:27,537
Jump!

133
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,031
Attention!

134
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:40,813
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

135
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,629
You've always wanted to take centre
stage, right? Now, what's the trouble?

136
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,972
I could use a schnapps now.

137
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,363
Can you imagine letting a totally
unknown man address you?

138
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,734
Can you imagine letting a
totally unknown man kiss you?

139
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:29,962
Can you imagine going to bed
with a totally unknown man?

140
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,739
Can you actually imagine
a totally unknown man?

141
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,835
Can you imagine a totally unknown woman?

142
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,475
I have to admit that I
wasn't prepared for that!

143
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:47,766
You're my first visitor who's not
entering through the door.

144
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:52,982
You can undress yourself if you like.

145
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,188
I'm on duty.

146
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,917
You haven't introduced yourself yet.

147
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:06,535
My name is Karin.
- Karin!

148
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:26,301
Do you mind if I'm on top?

149
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:00,930
Why don't you come in?

150
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,221
Marie arrived just before you.

151
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,612
Cherie! We've got a visitor!

152
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:18,523
I'll go ahead.

153
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:22,906
A visitor?

154
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:41,555
A chance acquaintance.

155
00:34:41,856 --> 00:34:46,414
We haven't known each other
for long. I told you about him.

156
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:51,415
He dialed the wrong number.
I've had the number changed since.

157
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,900
Now we probably have to move as well.

158
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,243
Why don't you sit down? S'il vous plaît?

159
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:20,421
You must be hungry too!

160
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:25,964
Marie! Please offer our
guest something to eat!

161
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:40,591
An olive?

162
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:46,961
A tiny little olive.

163
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:52,440
You're not intending to invite
yourself for lunch, are you?

164
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:58,460
Perhaps you'd like a martini
along with the olive.

165
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:02,140
A vodka martini.

166
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:07,478
One 3rd of Vodka and two 3rds Martini.
And stirred, not shaken, please!

167
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:12,299
Throw him out!

168
00:36:14,044 --> 00:36:16,527
Did he announce himself?

169
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:21,241
No.
Were you planning to play chess? No.

170
00:36:21,242 --> 00:36:23,442
Throw him out!

171
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:29,966
He's a peeping tom and a sadist.

172
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:35,818
In that case, he's got
everything women love!

173
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,706
He managed to make me
get up secretly last night.

174
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:58,963
Fancy to look around a little?
I'll show you how we live.

175
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:02,859
I guess you'd like to
take a shower first!

176
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:06,296
There, this is where we sleep.

177
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:10,653
But as you know, Marie's got
a flat of her own as well.

178
00:37:11,454 --> 00:37:15,741
As a sign of her... independence.

179
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:28,171
Have a look, I've got
some kind of spot there.

180
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:31,280
Is it something unusual?
You're a doctor, aren't you?

181
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:34,178
That's a mole.

182
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:22,725
- Hello? Who's there? - Hello?
- Hello? Please respond!

183
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,212
This is the bed-bunny speaking!

184
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:30,523
My place is on the pillow.

185
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,630
I'm supple, amusing, sophisticated,

186
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:39,138
gentle and full of tender consideration.

187
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:10,847
Fifth floor, last door.

188
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,931
What took you so long?

189
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:04,549
One can't let you out of sight
for five minutes!

190
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,907
One always has to worry
that you won't come back.

191
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:09,819
Give me a little kiss!

192
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:15,607
Don't always treat me like a toddler!
- I'm not treating you like a toddler.

193
00:44:15,608 --> 00:44:19,354
You are one!
My little baby...

194
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:27,805
That's the consulting room.
Where your desk will stand.

195
00:44:27,906 --> 00:44:29,906
This is the reception area.

196
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:32,541
This is where I will sit.

197
00:44:34,182 --> 00:44:39,116
Each time the door of the consulting
room opens, we'll see each other.

198
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:44,676
If animals live in captivity,
their fur gets lackluster.

199
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:48,730
What did you say? Max?

200
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:51,246
Yes?

201
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:53,890
You didn't listen to me!

202
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:55,690
I did.

203
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:57,955
Really. I was just thinking that if
I put my desk here, next to the window,

204
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:00,290
I can look outside sometimes.

205
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:05,763
Look outside? - Yes, look outside.
Watch the life in the street.

206
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:13,269
Let's go for lunch. I'm hungry.

207
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,582
Hungry! You're always hungry!

208
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:18,832
How do you like the rooms?
Come on, say something!

209
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:22,814
What are we going to do now?

210
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:27,398
Now?

211
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:36,331
You mean in general? With our life...

212
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:41,325
...when will we marry,
when will we buy the rings...

213
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:44,994
I mean what we'll do now.
Are we eating out or will you cook?

214
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,602
Your zipper is open.

215
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:58,530
You're cheating on me!
- I forgot to close the zipper.

216
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,088
It's happened quite often recently.

217
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,709
There's something behind this!

218
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:13,494
You're mad! Not every man with an
open zipper is cheating on his wife!

219
00:46:13,495 --> 00:46:18,829
I know it. The open zipper
has given you away!

220
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:23,906
You're absent-minded too.
- The open zipper.

221
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:28,474
Ridiculous!
- It's an obvious sign.

222
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:33,568
The zipper betrays you.
It's always like that with you guys.

223
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:37,616
When you've got dirty thoughts on
your mind, you forget about your zipper.

224
00:46:37,617 --> 00:46:39,402
That's how you notice it.

225
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:43,300
It's like leaving the door open
when you're expecting visitors.

226
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:45,413
Don't try to talk your way out of it!

227
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:35,807
Stop!

228
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:54,487
If we take out another loan,
I could hire a cook.

229
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:59,139
I'd receive you in our
cottage wearing a negligeé

230
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:04,001
and have a pheasant served
that was shot by a poacher.

231
00:51:04,718 --> 00:51:09,732
If we take out another loan,
I'll have to kill myself with a shotgun.

232
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:14,320
By the way, What will I get for having
passed the doctor's assistant exam?

233
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:20,394
I'm governmentally accredited now!
- You may take my blood sample later.

234
00:51:22,964 --> 00:51:28,076
Do you like my smock?
You haven't said anything yet.

235
00:51:29,877 --> 00:51:33,051
Do you think it's representative enough?

236
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:38,041
I think I'm an enhancement
to our surgery.

237
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,114
Maybe it's a little too conspicuous.
What do you think?

238
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:54,251
If you'd like my opinion as a man:
I like it.

239
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:57,735
As a doctor, I'm a little sceptical.

240
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:16,085
If you are sceptical,
I'll practice without work clothes.

241
00:52:30,196 --> 00:52:32,251
I want to be hunted.

242
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,800
I want to be hunted
through the apartment

243
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:36,143
and brought down in the bedroom.

244
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:42,671
That's what I wish for now
and also when I'm 80.

245
00:52:43,172 --> 00:52:48,900
You'll be 91 then and have no teeth left
but you'll still be chasing me.

246
00:52:48,901 --> 00:52:51,497
We'll also need a smaller flat.

247
00:52:51,598 --> 00:52:54,934
Otherwise going after me
would exhaust you too much.

248
00:54:44,968 --> 00:54:48,713
I'm pampering your psyche,
surrender to me!

249
00:54:48,714 --> 00:54:50,793
You're still holding yourself back -

250
00:54:50,894 --> 00:54:53,781
your innermost self
is avoiding the light.

251
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:56,358
You're now looking straight at one spot.

252
00:54:57,459 --> 00:54:59,401
Relax.

253
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:01,861
What do you see?

254
00:55:04,647 --> 00:55:09,807
I see the image of a beautiful,
tall, but weak woman in front of me.

255
00:55:09,908 --> 00:55:14,175
She's carrying a small,
strong man in her handbag.

256
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:18,029
The more she loves this man
the taller he gets

257
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:22,017
and the more she loses control over him.

258
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,002
The only time I get better
therapy results is when I tell jokes.

259
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:31,900
I'm worried about you.

260
00:55:32,023 --> 00:55:33,198
I know the symptoms.

261
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,820
You're in a state in which
intellectual capacity ceases to work.

262
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,105
It's like a psychosis.

263
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:43,614
The pathological notion
of loving somebody.

264
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:50,294
I've given up fighting it.

265
00:55:53,537 --> 00:55:56,033
The body of a woman.

266
00:55:57,292 --> 00:56:01,287
The breasts that suffocate you.
The thighs that clasp you.

267
00:56:01,288 --> 00:56:06,979
The kisses that take your breath.
The hair that tickles your nose.

268
00:56:08,622 --> 00:56:10,539
Do it the way you used to:

269
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:15,049
You meet them, persuade them
to give you a piece of ass...

270
00:56:16,836 --> 00:56:19,198
...and off you go.

271
00:56:19,299 --> 00:56:22,258
It rather looks as if she has my ass.

272
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:26,249
Those who fall in love are vain,

273
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:30,061
masochist, yearning for suffering.

274
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:35,916
I wasn't prepared for it.

275
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:40,213
I live in the present...

276
00:56:40,214 --> 00:56:44,237
and I've always thought that
falling in love belonged to the future.

277
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:49,088
Suddenly, everything's so concrete.

278
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:53,898
And so sinister too!
The lid has found its pot.

279
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:58,310
That's the sentence for
all the lonely hearts you broke,

280
00:56:58,311 --> 00:57:01,507
for all the kisses you didn't return.

281
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,809
What do you want?

282
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,200
I approach women.

283
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:30,498
There are three typical reactions:
They pretend to be deaf,

284
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:34,939
they get aggressive
or they run away.

285
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:41,965
I'm neither pretending to be deaf, nor
am I getting aggressive or running away.

286
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:17,657
Excuse me. May I have your
binoculars for a moment?

287
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:24,828
Have a seat!

288
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:37,202
You're intruding upon my life.

289
00:58:37,503 --> 00:58:40,211
I didn't ask you to do that.

290
00:58:41,238 --> 00:58:44,814
We don't know each other
and I'd like to keep it that way.

291
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:50,008
I'm not interested in
what you think... or feel.

292
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,607
I'm only interested in appearances.

293
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:12,823
In your eyes, your smile, your neck,

294
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:19,130
your legs, your ass.

295
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:24,661
I don't want to watch you
falling asleep or waking up.

296
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,259
I don't know what love is
and I don't want to know.

297
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:35,533
In the end, it's all a question of
the skin, the hair, the body odour.

298
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:45,727
I want our relationship to be as
clearly arranged as a romantic novel.

299
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:50,405
Clear, orderly and
divided into chapters.

300
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:56,455
You're lying!

301
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:08,857
Now you're even getting sentimental!

302
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:36,439
Dear fellow colleagues,

303
01:01:36,744 --> 01:01:39,074
Ladies,

304
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:43,532
I'd like to propose a toast to the
shiny new consultant surgeon.

305
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:48,201
Here's to you, Max!
- Cheers. To your health.

306
01:01:59,164 --> 01:02:02,863
Try this!
Come on, eat! Be good.

307
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:06,525
Don't you have any appetite?

308
01:02:11,656 --> 01:02:14,456
If you're in love, you
haven't got any appetite.

309
01:02:18,824 --> 01:02:23,025
What do you think of this?
Max is cheating on me.

310
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:45,425
Don't worry. The only thing he thinks
about when he meets a woman,

311
01:02:45,426 --> 01:02:47,937
is how he can get rid of her again.

312
01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:51,160
At this table, he holds
the record in adultering.

313
01:02:51,218 --> 01:02:53,682
He can't walk past any woman

314
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:57,679
without consoling her with
his physical endowments.

315
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,870
He's a neurotic romantic,

316
01:02:59,871 --> 01:03:05,114
obsessed by the idea that he might meet
the woman of his life without noticing.

317
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:11,214
Each time he's with a woman,
he loses a bit of his illusion.

318
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:17,333
In my case, probably
even therapy would fail.

319
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:22,920
All this is too complicated for me!
It doesn't even fit into my little head.

320
01:03:23,121 --> 01:03:26,063
Female brains are
smaller than male ones.

321
01:03:26,245 --> 01:03:29,730
As a psychiatrist, you should know that.

322
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:35,984
Aren't you feeling any guilt?

323
01:03:41,024 --> 01:03:46,399
When I think that life could've
brought me a man like him

324
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:53,908
Do you prefer educated or primitive
women? You know what I mean.

325
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,753
What you need is some stern guidance!

326
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:06,718
Stir some bromide into
his coffee every morning.

327
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:11,084
It suppresses the sexual drive.

328
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:15,765
That's what we do at our prison wards.

329
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:24,657
How many women do you think a man
can love in his life? I mean physically.

330
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:32,172
1000. 2000. Until I turn forty.

331
01:04:32,173 --> 01:04:36,218
How long have you known each other?
- I don't know.

332
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:39,961
I can't keep numbers.
- For roughly six years.

333
01:04:40,062 --> 01:04:42,441
A relationship lasts 6 years on average.

334
01:04:42,542 --> 01:04:44,571
Of this time, you're
in love for 4 months,

335
01:04:44,606 --> 01:04:46,621
you love each other for 1 year,

336
01:04:46,722 --> 01:04:50,026
you get along well with
each other for another one.

337
01:04:50,183 --> 01:04:52,783
You know the rest.

338
01:04:52,884 --> 01:04:57,430
If one believes the statistics, your
relationship can't be happy any longer.

339
01:04:57,431 --> 01:05:03,129
But...you live together,
you eat together...

340
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,564
and you're still sleeping together.

341
01:05:06,665 --> 01:05:11,706
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
You both need a change.

342
01:05:16,887 --> 01:05:20,173
Don't you ever think I'll give Max up.

343
01:05:20,474 --> 01:05:25,058
You love me.
There's no use in resisting it.

344
01:05:26,484 --> 01:05:31,022
You've won my heart
and now I'll stay with you.

345
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:35,578
You need me.
You know that, don't you?

346
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:39,222
You can't even see what's
in front of you without me.

347
01:05:39,323 --> 01:05:43,258
You can't even cheat on me
without thinking of me.

348
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:50,958
I just wanted to feel again
what it's like to be in love!

349
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:56,693
He only wanted to feel again
what it's like to be in love!

350
01:06:00,783 --> 01:06:04,057
Let's drink to that!

351
01:06:10,631 --> 01:06:14,419
You've got all the features
that I find nauseating.

352
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:17,950
But I want to be close
to you nevertheless.

353
01:06:18,633 --> 01:06:21,838
Why are you saying it so sadly?

354
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:26,704
I don't know whether I
should be sad or happy.

355
01:06:26,936 --> 01:06:29,303
I'm both at the same time.

356
01:06:29,404 --> 01:06:32,383
I'm feeling somthing
different from my thoughts

357
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:36,216
and what I'm saying
differs from my thoughts.

358
01:06:49,057 --> 01:06:51,410
I'll leave you...

359
01:06:57,741 --> 01:07:00,753
and... in your remembrance,

360
01:07:00,754 --> 01:07:03,848
I'll become the woman you need.

361
01:07:03,971 --> 01:07:09,774
Beautiful. Clever. Stupid. Elegant.

362
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:13,443
Vulgar. Temperamental.

363
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:16,913
Lascivious. Lady-like.

364
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,925
Slutty. Companionable.

365
01:07:21,126 --> 01:07:23,684
Unreachable.

366
01:07:27,612 --> 01:07:32,409
This is our last night.
My farewell performance.

367
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:40,863
I'm stroking you.

368
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,389
I'm kissing you.

369
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:52,572
I'm biting you.

370
01:07:53,523 --> 01:07:56,321
I'm choking you.

371
01:08:00,187 --> 01:08:02,775
Leave me in peace.

372
01:11:41,942 --> 01:11:43,906
I don't love you.

373
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:53,629
I don't love you.

374
01:11:55,604 --> 01:11:57,473
I don't love you.

375
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:01,224
I don't love you.

376
01:12:03,259 --> 01:12:05,903
I don't love you.

377
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:09,778
I don't love you.

378
01:13:43,638 --> 01:13:45,716
What do you see?

379
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:49,657
A man who's rushing into
an abyss at 150 an hour.

380
01:13:51,396 --> 01:13:53,985
And what else do you see?

381
01:13:53,986 --> 01:13:58,593
A woman who's rushing into an abyss
together with a man at 150 an hour.

382
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,516
Underwater you can see
the one you love.

383
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,694
Don't say anything.

384
01:19:30,872 --> 01:19:33,383
I forgive you.

385
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:26,449
This mood, the light...

386
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:29,539
Like in the paintings of Turner.

387
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:35,112
William Turner, 1775 till 1851.

388
01:20:35,218 --> 01:20:38,096
I don't love you.

389
01:21:34,369 --> 01:21:36,166
Are you making any progress?

390
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:41,372
Max is still reluctant.

391
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,391
Hurry up, or the
reconciliation party will be over!

392
01:22:00,589 --> 01:22:04,062
Actually, it's all the
little rascal's fault.

393
01:22:04,063 --> 01:22:07,467
You're too weak to prevail against him.

394
01:22:07,868 --> 01:22:10,654
He has bewitched you completely!

395
01:22:10,899 --> 01:22:16,024
Don't you see how indiscriminate he is?
He has no stature, no class.

396
01:22:16,025 --> 01:22:18,829
He would snuggle against any woman.

397
01:22:19,516 --> 01:22:22,213
The little monster!

398
01:22:23,015 --> 01:22:26,085
He's lacking obedience and discipline.

399
01:22:26,086 --> 01:22:30,777
He has to learn how
to obey. Like a soldier.

400
01:22:30,878 --> 01:22:34,792
A little soldier. A bed-soldier.

401
01:22:36,325 --> 01:22:41,459
And if he doesn't obey, he has to join
the latrine commando and clean the loo.

402
01:22:42,904 --> 01:22:46,367
Don't try, it's useless.
He's a deserter.

403
01:22:56,752 --> 01:23:01,051
We saw there was still light
and thought we'd nip in.

404
01:23:04,756 --> 01:23:08,049
Marie was longing for you so much!

405
01:23:08,869 --> 01:23:11,865
Why don't you come in?

406
01:23:18,938 --> 01:23:23,875
Fancy to look around a little?
I'll show you how we live.

407
01:23:28,648 --> 01:23:31,543
Please feel at home!

408
01:23:31,976 --> 01:23:36,616
You'll find the drinks in the next room.
- We've brought our own along.

409
01:23:59,753 --> 01:24:02,229
Surprise guests.

410
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,971
Surprise guests.

411
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:59,172
Kurt has come because of you.
He was longing for you so much.

412
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,191
See how he's smiling?

413
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:05,761
He's smiling at you!

414
01:25:05,862 --> 01:25:08,146
At me?

415
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:11,914
Yes, quite faintly. He doesn't
dare completely because I'm with you.

416
01:25:13,703 --> 01:25:16,724
I believe he's looking for a new start.

417
01:25:17,797 --> 01:25:21,943
See how he's smiling?
- I can't see anything.

418
01:25:24,502 --> 01:25:27,580
She's smiling at you!
- Who?

419
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:31,426
Coco.
- She's smiling?

420
01:25:31,427 --> 01:25:33,663
I can't see anything.

421
01:25:34,752 --> 01:25:37,106
She's very shy.

422
01:25:37,207 --> 01:25:39,831
He's so self-conscious.

423
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,496
Don't you feel it at least?
He's smiling from inside.

424
01:25:43,497 --> 01:25:46,391
Women sense things like that.

425
01:25:46,749 --> 01:25:50,525
Yes. Now I see it.

426
01:25:51,765 --> 01:25:54,612
He's smiling like a reception clerk.

427
01:25:54,713 --> 01:25:58,622
He's smiling at everybody.
- His smile is meant for you!

428
01:26:01,184 --> 01:26:04,245
Try to concentrate on it!

429
01:26:07,765 --> 01:26:11,811
You see?
Now she's smiling quite clearly!

430
01:26:12,717 --> 01:26:17,589
She said you've got the same elegant
charisma as one of Fitzgerald's heroes.

431
01:26:18,068 --> 01:26:21,162
And that you looked like a figure

432
01:26:21,163 --> 01:26:24,175
in a painting by Renoir.

433
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:28,207
Why are you telling me all this?

434
01:26:28,298 --> 01:26:32,469
So that you won't miss anything.
You're so lusty for life!

435
01:26:33,047 --> 01:26:37,537
And so that you won't tell me
that I kept you from anything.

436
01:26:39,056 --> 01:26:41,842
Strange...

437
01:26:41,895 --> 01:26:45,283
I believe she's smiling at you now.

438
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:50,374
Coco is about to leave Max.

439
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:04,380
I'd like you to dance with me.

440
01:30:20,765 --> 01:30:23,832
You've got such hungry eyes.

441
01:30:30,275 --> 01:30:33,287
I like men with hungry eyes.

442
01:30:40,624 --> 01:30:44,439
I'd like to get drugged and kidnapped.

443
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:07,177
