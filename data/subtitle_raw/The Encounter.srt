1
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,267
Here we go, folks.

2
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,501
Show's about to start.

3
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:19,243
We got multiple enemies! Get into 360!

4
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:34,094
Changing magazines! 360 security!

5
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:47,905
Hey, buddy!

6
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:49,941
We got a live one here.

7
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,025
<i>735, come in, 735.</i>

8
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:10,898
<i>Umm, tracking something new here.</i>

9
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,267
<i>Yeah, it just lit up. What is that?</i>

10
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,468
<i>Weird.</i>

11
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,107
<i>Try to call them on 121.5 VHF.</i>

12
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:24,875
<i>Roger. Unidentified aircraft
40 miles west of Rollins field.</i>

13
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,980
<i>This is Rollins
tower, do you read me?</i>

14
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:31,552
<i>Please respond. What are
your intentions? Over.</i>

15
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:36,287
<i>Unidentified aircraft, now 35
miles west of Rollins Field.</i>

16
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:37,655
<i>You're entering controlled airspace.</i>

17
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:39,626
<i>Please identify.</i>

18
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,595
<i>Not responding.</i>

19
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:45,529
<i>Okay, call it in.</i>

20
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:48,367
<i>Roger that.</i>

21
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,602
<i>Albuquerque Center,
this is Rollins Tower.</i>

22
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,872
<i>This is Center, go ahead, Rollins.</i>

23
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:56,674
<i>We've got an unidentified
contact bearing 270 degrees,</i>

24
00:03:56,676 --> 00:04:00,345
<i>20 miles, speed 600 knots;
appears to be descending fast.</i>

25
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:02,947
<i>You tracking a meteor, Rollins?</i>

26
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:05,284
<i>Negative, we've got visual on it,</i>

27
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,522
<i>definitely no meteor.</i>

28
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:11,623
<i>Stand by, Rollins.</i>

29
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,357
<i>Any ideas there, Jim?</i>

30
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,596
<i>Not sure, I'm switching to thermal.</i>

31
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:27,141
<i>Well, whatever it
is, it's going down.</i>

32
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,679
<i>Damn.</i>

33
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,513
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

34
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:38,481
<i>Whatever it was, it's
down for the count.</i>

35
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:39,717
<i>Rollins Tower...</i>

36
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:43,087
<i>Albuquerque Center, I'm
getting heavy interference,</i>

37
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:44,988
<i>say again?</i>

38
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,091
<i>Rollins Tower, please confirm...</i>

39
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:50,794
<i>Phone's dead,</i>

40
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:54,065
<i>try the radio on a
different frequency.</i>

41
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,733
<i>Any station, any station,</i>

42
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:59,904
<i>this is Rollins Tower on
Victor, anybody read me?</i>

43
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:02,472
<i>This is crazy. You gotta hear this.</i>

44
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:03,541
<i>What?</i>

45
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,676
<i>I'm gonna patch it through.</i>

46
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,762
Okay, we are rollin' here

47
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,966
on another beautiful Arizona morning.

48
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,734
Oh!

49
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:33,938
Hey, Parker, buddy, I
see you're up at least!

50
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,638
Huh!

51
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,508
Hey, buddy!

52
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,010
Hey, good morning!

53
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:42,512
I know, buddy. I wish you could come, too.

54
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:45,616
I know, I know, don't
blame me, blame your mom.

55
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,786
She's the one that said there
wasn't enough room in the car.

56
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:51,955
I know, buddy. I call bullshit, too.

57
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,724
Here we go!

58
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,392
Morning, sunshines!

59
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:57,527
Collin! God!

60
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,162
Already with the camera?

61
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:00,630
Aw, wake up, guys!

62
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:02,866
I got a fun weekend planned for us!

63
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:05,736
Dude, I'll give you $50 if
you give us one more hour.

64
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,072
No, no can do, brother. Sorry.

65
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:10,974
As John Wayne once said,
we're burning daylight.

66
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:12,510
Let's do this.

67
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:14,077
- Fucker.
- Uh-huh.

68
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,012
For a hundred, I might reconsider.

69
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:18,815
- Fine, I'll write you a check.
- No, no, no. Cash money only.

70
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:25,455
Hey, Kimmy.

71
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:28,892
Time to wake up. Morning, baby.

72
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,527
Morning, hey.

73
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,061
What are you doing?

74
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:34,765
I'm watching you.

75
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:37,635
Am I totally creeping you out or what?

76
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:38,868
Pervert.

77
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,969
How long have you been filming me?

78
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:43,039
I don't know, 30, 40 minutes? Maybe less.

79
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,909
- So creepy.
- Uh-huh.

80
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:49,613
Hey, someone's camera-shy. Come on, baby.

81
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:50,647
Give it to me.

82
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,916
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

83
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,053
- Give it.
- Easy. Oh!

84
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:58,087
See how you like it.

85
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,260
Oh... Now what?

86
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,560
Now that I've got you where I want you...

87
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:06,197
Oh, hello.

88
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,000
That what you wanna see,
you dirty little perv?

89
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:12,803
You know it. Please.

90
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,871
- Give it to me.
- No, not the camera.

91
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:16,739
Come on. No, no.

92
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:20,243
Easy, alright. Ah...

93
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:22,079
Okay.

94
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,248
Okay?

95
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,885
- Talk to me.
- Talk to you about?

96
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,253
Tell me what you're thinking.

97
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:32,957
I'm thinking...

98
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,592
...that I love you.

99
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:36,527
Aww, you're sweet.

100
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,195
And I think you're beautiful.

101
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:41,265
And...? What else?

102
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:46,704
I think you are the most...

103
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:51,140
...sexiest woman in the world.

104
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:53,710
Very nice. Keep going.

105
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:57,116
- The most intelligent.
- That's definitely true.

106
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,786
Hey, hey.

107
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:06,190
- Hands off the merchandise.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

108
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:09,193
No... tease! Total tease!

109
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,060
Hey.

110
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:13,731
You know I just love making you crazy.

111
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,599
Where you going? What're you doing?

112
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:18,601
I gotta pee.

113
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:21,171
Really?

114
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:29,149
She leaves me to fend for myself again.

115
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:31,448
Morning all!

116
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,318
Well, it is Friday, and
for many of you, that means

117
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,621
you have a fun and exciting
weekend to look forward to,

118
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:41,158
but I am working, and not
that I don't love what I do,

119
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,561
but seeing as how it is
"Full Disclosure Friday,"

120
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:46,063
I am not really feeling it today.

121
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, one cool thing, there was a report
of a meteor touching down near Hadly Hill.

122
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,602
And for those of you that don't know Hadly,

123
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,270
it's what we like to call a starter hill.

124
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:55,673
It's not too challenging of a climb,

125
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:56,975
but it's a beautiful hike,

126
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:59,976
it's perfect for those of you
that have small children with you.

127
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:04,048
Um, just don't get hit
by any falling meteors.

128
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,649
Um, now what some may
not know about meteors,

129
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:09,319
is that even though they look really
bright and beautiful in the sky,

130
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,920
what ends up touching down

131
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:13,823
is usually not that much
bigger than an acorn.

132
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:16,226
So it's kind of uneventful,
for the most part,

133
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,998
but it's always fun to investigate.

134
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:23,933
Ah, it's already cold. That's not good.

135
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,669
And it is later than I thought.

136
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,204
God, I hate when that happens.

137
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,773
Uh, okay!

138
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:32,375
This is Alice the park ranger, signing off.

139
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,611

141
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:40,053
You guys know the drill. Okay, bye!

142
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:48,891
Okay, here we are. First stop.

143
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:51,164
Casa de Duncan.

144
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:13,183
Hey, Dunk, what's up, buddy?

145
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:15,986
How're you doing today?

146
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,258
Alrightey.

147
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:27,866
Hope anybody's home.

148
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,668
Hello?

149
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,505
Oh, guess I'm breaking in.

150
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:42,913
- Hey, Janice, how're you doing?
- Hey.

151
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,414
Where's the old man?

152
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,817
- Where do you think?
- Alright.

153
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:48,151
See ya later.

154
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:50,520
Later.

155
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:53,827
So, uh, Duncan's got something
he wants to show you all.

156
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,794
- You live?
- Locked and loaded.

157
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,097
Got something I wanna show you.

158
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,865
What're you gonna show us
with that old hunk of junk?

159
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:06,035
Well, most folks look
at this, call it a scope.

160
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:08,038
But after a few of my modifications,

161
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,908
it is now known as the
Duncan Harvey original.

162
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,143
Shameless self-promoter!

163
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,377
You wanna see what it can do?

164
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,180
Yeah! Why the hell not?

165
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:19,183
- That's my mark.
- Alright, that ain't happening,

166
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:21,453
guess it'd have to be eyes on you.

167
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,026
Well?

168
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:32,865
What, you missed?

169
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,141
- How 'bout them apples?
- Shit!

170
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:46,476
No shit!

171
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:48,978
That's more like... 500 yards!

172
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,850
With this rig, I could
make the same at six.

173
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,952
Okay, alright, Duncan, you impressed me.

174
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:57,053
- Damn right.
- Well, but now how do I know

175
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,457
you didn't come out here and
take that shot an hour ago?

176
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,894
Nah, I made it last night
at ten yards, maybe twelve.

177
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,162
Yeah, I believe that, I believe that.

178
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:10,233
But seriously, that's
a bullseye at 450 yards.

179
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,770
I wish I could take credit,

180
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:14,837
but with this here hand-crafted,

181
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,141
and fully patented, Harvey scope,

182
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:21,178
hell, a brain dead stepchild
could make that shot.

183
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,383
Hey, whoa, man!

184
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:26,250
What the hell?

185
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:30,523
Some kind of weird ass bullshit TV...

186
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:35,292
Okay.

187
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:38,861
So you got the house and gate keys?

188
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,265
I think that should be it.

189
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:45,335
You can call me on the cellular
'til we get to the high country.

190
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:48,404
I got it. It's no problem.

191
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:51,475
- Guessing we're all set then.
- Daylight's a burnin'.

192
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:55,412
Yeah, guess it's time to shorten the road.

193
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:56,847
See ya Sunday.

194
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:58,915
Hey, bring me back a ten point!

195
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,149
I'll bring you back two ten points.

196
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:01,518
Alright.

197
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,556
Take it easy, Janice.

198
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:13,831
You're on driving duty, old man.

199
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,202
What'd you say?

200
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:25,442
Let the immortals ride again.

201
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:32,582
Okay, couldn't get the exact coordinates

202
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:37,353
on that meteor, but I'm
seeing some smoke up here.

203
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:39,456
Could be a brush fire,

204
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,491
and with the little rain fall we've
had this year, that could be bad,

205
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:45,996
really bad, considering
how dry everything is.

206
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,605
Not sure what's going on,

207
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,140
but I'm gonna let this run.

208
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:00,976
On my way to check out this meteor,

209
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:04,580
and my radio is doing all kinds of crazy...

210
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:09,485
At first nothing, but the
closer I get to my destination,

211
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:12,124
this weird sound is getting louder.

212
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:23,099
Okay,

213
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,469
on foot from here.

214
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:35,977
Okay, here we are down
at the old swimming hole,

215
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:38,947
April 2012.

216
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,616
There's my boy, Ryan, fishing.

217
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:44,052
Hey, Ryan, any biters?

218
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:46,288
- Not yet.
- Know why?

219
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,690
That...

220
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:50,692
...is a swimming hole! Not a fishing hole.

221
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:51,961
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:54,429
Whoa. This is where I
should be aiming my camera.

223
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:57,033
Say hey to the camera, girls!

224
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:59,335
- Hey, camera.
- Yeah, yeah.

225
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:01,403
You guys not getting
into the water or what?

226
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:04,105
Well, Ryan says we'll
scare off the fishies.

227
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:05,441
I'm sorry? What? I can't hear you.

228
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:08,376
- What the fuck just landed on me?!
- Whoa, whoa, hey, now.

229
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:10,546
- Be careful.
- "Hey now" is right.

230
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:13,548
- Just lost my PG rating.
- That totally freaked me out.

231
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,250
It was just a little bug!

232
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,019
There was nothing little about it.

233
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:18,254
If this ends up on
YouTube, I'm gonna kill you.

234
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:21,624
Wimpy, Wimpy, hey, Mr.
Skin, maybe, but you know...

235
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:24,159
- Shut up!
- You two, trust me, trust me.

236
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,298
I'm the filmmaker here.

237
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,185
I've found the source of the smoke, and...

238
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:52,190
Well, it can't be what it looks like.

239
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:10,105
Look at the size of this thing.

240
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,576
This is...

241
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:17,712
Holy shit...

242
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,523
What is this growing here?

243
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:28,526
322, come in.

244
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,802
What the hello?

245
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,273
Ahh!

246
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:46,542
Ugh, something just bit me.

247
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:50,145
Okay, that... really stings.

248
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:53,381
Okay, I'm out of here.

249
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,165
'Kay, whatever that was...

250
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,601
I-I've gotta get ahold of Poison Control.

251
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:15,136
Following protocol when
you don't know what bit you,

252
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:17,272
you're supposed to grab a sample,

253
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:21,410
but I am not touching whatever that was.

254
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:24,279
322, come in!

255
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:27,249
This is Range One calling
South Range dispatch.

256
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:34,226
What's this now? South Range dispatch?

257
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:39,327
322? Anyone?

258
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,830
Can anyone read me? Over.

259
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:57,579
Alright now, we're doing this
thing by camp rules, ain't we?

260
00:17:57,581 --> 00:18:00,281
You really should know 'em by now,

261
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:01,650
but I'll repeat 'em for the record.

262
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:03,719
- Let's hear 'em.
- Rule number one...

263
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:06,255
- Don't shit where you eat.
- That's right.

264
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:09,491
I catch you pinching logs in my cabin,

265
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,626
and it'll be your head mounted on the wall.

266
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:14,230
Rule number one. When you
gotta go, you go outside.

267
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:17,732
And bury your own damn awful.
Nobody wants to step in it.

268
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:20,635
- Alright. Rule number two?
- Rule number two.

269
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,805
You're only allowed to eat what you kill.

270
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:26,808
You don't kill, you go
hungry. Simple as that.

271
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,777
And, uh, rule number three?

272
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,480
Don't jerk off where I can see ya.

273
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:34,482
That's right, Trevor,
added that one just for you.

274
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,861
Is that camera the heaviest
thing you're gonna lift today?

275
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,499
Alright.

276
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:58,742
Okay, I've gotta get this...

277
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:03,179
...recorded.

278
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:06,781
This is not like any
bite I've ever had before.

279
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:08,651
It's been...

280
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:11,287
...no more than 30 or...

281
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:14,289
...or 35 minutes since I was...

282
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,227
...stung by whatever that was.

283
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:26,402
This is really...

284
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:28,671
...hard to believe.

285
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:30,542
Ugh!

286
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,410
Ugh...

287
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,479
Following procedure to...

288
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:41,217
...the letter, I've
made several attempts at

289
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:44,420
contacting Poison Control, but

290
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:47,355
low and behold, my radios don't work.

291
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:50,459
Both in my truck and here at the office,

292
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,361
this is what I get.

293
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:03,872
So, I'm not able to get through to anybody,

294
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:06,374
not Poison Control,

295
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:08,509
not Central station...

296
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,048
No one.

297
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:14,486
To further complicate things, I...

298
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,988
I feel terrible,

299
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,557
and I-I can see that I
look just as bad as I feel.

300
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,461
I've pretty much done as
much as I can here by myself.

301
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:28,730
Simple first aid has been administered,

302
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:32,601
but something tells me
that's not gonna cut it.

303
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:37,538
Last reading was...

304
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,878
103.6.

305
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:44,813
That's not good.

306
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:49,518
Well, that's...

307
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:53,490
That's scary.

308
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,859
I am in no...

309
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:01,063
Excuse me.

310
00:21:06,303 --> 00:21:09,371
I am in no condition to...

311
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:12,974
...operate a vehicle, and it is a...

312
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:15,579
It is a good, um...

313
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:23,384
...2.5 miles of rough terrain
to get down the mountain on foot.

314
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,788
Uh, all I can think now

315
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,990
is to...

316
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:32,394
...try smoke flairs.

317
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:35,532
And hope that somebody sees them.

318
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,537
It's all I can do.

319
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,910
It's all I can...

320
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:57,955
Wow, this is bad.

321
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,358
Okay.

322
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,059
Okay.

323
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:07,932
I'm gonna have to sign off now.

324
00:22:15,405 --> 00:22:16,805
Alright.

325
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:18,039
Just a quick rundown.

326
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,143
I'm totally out here doin'
the Francis Ford Coppola thing.

327
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:23,979
Got a GoPro Fully High Definition
Camera mounted to my head,

328
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:26,080
modded by myself for the true huntsmen,

329
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:28,049
gives me the option of going infrared.

330
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,919
Got a second one of these bad boys,
it's filming me talking to you right now.

331
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:31,987
Now, it works for a good backup,

332
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:34,123
but I can also strap it
to my chest strap here.

333
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,857
It gives a different field of vision.

334
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:38,026
Usually like to shoot 60p, ultra-wide.

335
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:39,595
That guy.

336
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:40,996
Now.

337
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:43,499
This is a truly Trevor original.

338
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:46,602
Hi-Fi scope camera.

339
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:49,605
Best angle for the kill shots to be sure.

340
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:50,739
Trev!

341
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,708
You done playin' with yourself?

342
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,777
Duncan, grouchy old codger as always.

343
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:58,146
Nah, Dunk, I'm just waiting for you
to come over here and finish me off.

344
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:01,083
Goddamn kids, no respect today.

345
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:03,519
Always bustin' balls.

346
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,957
You ready for this, old man?

347
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:09,490
Shit, boy,

348
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:11,625
you supposed to be an astronaut?

349
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:14,595
Laugh now, 20 bucks says I get first kill.

350
00:23:14,597 --> 00:23:17,765
- Now you're dreamin'.
- Camera ain't gonna lie, buddy.

351
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:20,867
Same can't be said for you, though.

352
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:24,740
Alright, the game is on, folks.

353
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,093
This...

354
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:50,133
This can't be real.

355
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:11,751
Range One to South Range dispatch.

356
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:18,558
Anyone with ears on?

357
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:26,700
Anyone at all hearing me?

358
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,643
If anyone can hear me,
this is Alice Sumner,

359
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:38,011
park ranger number f...

360
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:40,114
4102.

361
00:24:42,652 --> 00:24:46,086
I've been infected with some kind of toxin.

362
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:50,290
In need of immediate medical assistance.

363
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:52,826
Anyone...

364
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:57,198
Please!

365
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:11,278
Alright, here we are, folks, huh!

366
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,749
Outside camping.

367
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:18,219
How are you, guys? Huh? Everybody good?

368
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:20,287
- Good.
- Doing good, buddy.

369
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,226
Everybody hanging out
by the campfire, yeah.

370
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:27,761
Ahh, we're just hanging out, you know.

371
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,639
Alright, alright, alright, hey, ladies,

372
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:41,642
spread the love to the last true
hippie among us here, please.

373
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:44,644
Now that's what's up. Pass the pipe.

374
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,146
Lookin' out for you, my man.

375
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:48,114
Wait, wait, wait, that's not my pipe.

376
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:50,116
Well, yeah, it's not your smoke either.

377
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:53,688
- This is pure Cali Hydro.
- That good!

378
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,655
That good stuff.

379
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:56,723
Hey!

380
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:58,325
What are you doing in here?

381
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:00,995
- We're about to light the fire.
- Oh, yeah?

382
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:04,731
You can light my fire. That's cheesy, huh?

383
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:07,902
- You are so stoned.
- Yes, I am high.

384
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:12,006
I am, that Cali shit
is way better than mine.

385
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:16,076
Wait. Wait, wait.

386
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:18,245
I came in here for something.

387
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:20,614
Yeah, I'm right here.

388
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:22,983
- Not gonna happen.
- What? Why?

389
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:25,853
Sorry, no lovin' for you.

390
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,689
Really? It-It'll only take a second.

391
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:30,391
Isn't that the sad truth.

392
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:33,893
- Come here.
- No, wait, wait, not here.

393
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:36,697
Why? We always make love up here.

394
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:39,100
Our friends are right outside.

395
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:44,969
No, they're probably in their tent doing
the same thing that I'm trying to do.

396
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,172
You know...

397
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:48,875
Hello!

398
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:51,245
I spilled bong juice all over myself.

399
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:55,950
- You're so wasted!
- Yeah, and I'm so hungry!

400
00:26:58,654 --> 00:26:59,886
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

401
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:01,223
This one.

402
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:06,896
Aww! My baby looks sad.

403
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,898
You're so sexy.

404
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,970
- You like?
- Oh, I like? Are you kidding me? I love.

405
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:18,873
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

406
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,708
Oh, you silly, silly girl.

407
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,843
I'm not about to put
on a show for everybody.

408
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:26,247
Oh, modest and virtuous woman.

409
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:29,952
That's right, so camera off.

410
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,425
What the fuck?

411
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:13,028
This is too weird.

412
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,439
Something scared off the whole damn forest.

413
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,576
Where'd Duncan get to?

414
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,413
Okay, so, uh...

415
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:36,217
I'm gonna show you somethin' here.

416
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:39,389
I... I've never seen anything like this.

417
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:47,063
What in God's name did this?

418
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,066
Dunk?

419
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:54,403
Hey!

420
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:58,972
Man, what you think this was?

421
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:02,809
Judging by the size of
these rib bones, I'd say this

422
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:05,880
used to be a 10 to 12 point buck.

423
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:08,181
Probably a two to three hundred pounder.

424
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:10,284
No fucking way, man.

425
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:12,152
Can you believe this?

426
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:14,190
I'm seein', but I ain't.

427
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,327
Pod thing growing on it?

428
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:21,996
Holy cow.

429
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:24,899
Uh, just a quick note,

430
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:26,866
I've been hunting and fishing
in these woods all my life.

431
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:30,403
I've seen hundreds of animal carcasses.

432
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:33,175
I ain't never seen anything like this.

433
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,143
Never.

434
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:39,615
Never even heard of anything like this.

435
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:45,688
I mean, do you know anything
that might've caused this?

436
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,023
No.

437
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:51,357
Too weird.

438
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,326
Spooky.

439
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:54,564
Yeah.

440
00:29:55,998 --> 00:29:57,463
Trev?

441
00:29:57,465 --> 00:30:00,066
Still out there?

442
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:02,036
I don't know,

443
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:03,571
but we're moving on.

444
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:05,141
Yeah.

445
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:12,512
Thought I'd flip on here for a minute.

446
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:16,316
Got maybe a couple hours of daylight left,

447
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:18,018
so I've started to get a move on here

448
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,588
'cause I do not wanna get
caught here after dark.

449
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,325
Goddammit, it's been one weird ass day.

450
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:26,229
Hey, Dunk?

451
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:30,431
Duncan, I think we should
head back to the cabin.

452
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,566
I don't get it.

453
00:30:32,568 --> 00:30:34,934
Let's pack it in, man.

454
00:30:34,936 --> 00:30:36,135
You hear that?

455
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,606
No, what?

456
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:41,611
Nothing.

457
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:52,518
Not so much as a bird chirping

458
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,723
or a fly buzzin'.

459
00:30:56,358 --> 00:30:59,425
Alright, I really think we
should, we should head back.

460
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,595
Probably so.

461
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:04,064
It's getting spooky,
man, there's nothing here.

462
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:05,132
No.

463
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:08,501
- What?
- Something's here.

464
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:10,504
It's definitely close.

465
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,640
Hey! Dunk!

466
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:15,976
- Where you going, man?
- Shit!

467
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:18,946
What? Hey, where...
Dunk, come back here, man!

468
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:21,981
Goddammit!

469
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:35,996
Jesus Christ!

470
00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:38,464
- Fuck!
- Save me, boy!

471
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,668
Oh, man, what the hell did this to you?!

472
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,004
You're crazy, old man,
I ain't goin' nowhere.

473
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:46,606
Get the hell outta here, Trevor!

474
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:49,143
Jesus fucking Christ!

475
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:50,177
Here.

476
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:55,118
Put the pressure on there!

477
00:31:57,586 --> 00:32:01,354
I gotta get you out-a here,
buddy, but I can't risk movin' ya.

478
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:05,291
Breaker, Breaker, on emergency channel!

479
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:08,062
Is anybody out there with ears on?

480
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,529
Goddammit.

481
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:12,432
Alright, buddy,

482
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:15,702
here's the situation, I can't...

483
00:32:15,704 --> 00:32:18,305
I can't get anyone on the radio, must be
some kind of interference or something.

484
00:32:18,307 --> 00:32:20,975
I gotta get to better
ground, so you just...

485
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:23,246
You just sit tight.

486
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:27,145
Goddammit!

487
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,114
Okay, okay.

488
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,585
Wait, wait.

489
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:35,254
Okay, now just keep one hand there.

490
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:37,190
Just keep it firm.

491
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:39,992
And keep that hand...

492
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:41,995
Right there, don't worry, buddy.

493
00:32:41,997 --> 00:32:43,729
Alright, alright, buddy.

494
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,331
You just sit tight, I'll be back.

495
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,802
I'll be back!

496
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,584
Calling on emergency channel!

497
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:07,519
Breaker, Breaker! C.H.... C.H. 9,

498
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,189
in need of immediate
medical assistance! Over.

499
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:21,601
Sorry, folks, we're having
some technical difficulties,

500
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:26,171
but anyhow... let's see
what people are doing.

501
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:29,475
- Careful with the camera.
- I am!

502
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:32,111
God. Why does he treat
me like I'm retarded?

503
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,779
I know how to do this shit.

504
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:36,082
Okay, maybe not.

505
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:37,115
Fuck it.

506
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:38,452
Hey, Kim!

507
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:45,158
Collin, your fiancé has, like,
a totally rockin' pair of tits.

508
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,660
- Don't I know it.
- Don't I know it.

509
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:49,261
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Just joking!

510
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,395
Excuse me?

511
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:53,399
Thanks, but that's not really true.

512
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:56,268
It is true. Oh, yeah.

513
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,539
- Thank God for push-up bras, right?
- My God, such modesty!

514
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,241
- Hey, watch out.
- Hey, whoa!

515
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:05,545
You're supposed... You're
supposed to toast the marshmallow!

516
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:07,213
You're flamin' it!

517
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:09,749
I don't think there's exactly a set of
rules when it comes to the mellow, right?

518
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:12,717
Hey, guys, who has a scary story?

519
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,420
Kimberly? Any scary stories?

520
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:17,190
Fuck no, girl, I don't
got no scary stories.

521
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:18,858
Well, you got a scary story, baby, come on.

522
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,126
Come up with something.

523
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:22,695
Come up with something... baby,
you wanna put down the camera?

524
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,496
Join us, grab a beer, relax, please.

525
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:26,699
You guys have no respect for tradition.

526
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,800
Honey, I love you,

527
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,369
but it's tradition when you're 12.

528
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:32,637
Whatever. Tough crowd.

529
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,673
Uh, Ryan, you got anymore of that weed?

530
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:37,642
- Yes! That's communal! Let's smoke.
- Yes... No! No, no, no.

531
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:39,612
- Collin, you're up.
- I'm up?

532
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:42,115
Yup, scary story, and go!

533
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:44,483
- You want a scary story?
- Yup, go.

534
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:46,686
- Alright, I got a scary story.
- Hit me!

535
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:49,222
I got a super fuckin'
scary story, you ready?

536
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:51,858
- Let's hear it.
- No, not really, at all.

537
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,992
Alright.

538
00:34:52,994 --> 00:34:56,128
Well, there once was this
talented young filmmaker...

539
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,863
- Ooh!
- ...that decided rather than to

540
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,599
follow the path to fame and fortune,

541
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:03,469
decided to teach Intro to Cinema
at the local community college.

542
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:05,338
Oh, that is super fucked up.

543
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:09,275
- You wanted scary, right?
- We got it.

544
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:11,744
And what's worse is
that most of his students

545
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:15,481
took his class to avoid being
challenged by a real teacher.

546
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:19,751
You're a really good teacher.

547
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:22,722
He's my favorite teacher.

548
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,690
Right, 'cause that's how they met.

549
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:26,559
- Hot for teacher.
- Hot for student.

550
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:28,830
Yup.

551
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,664
- That is illegal, though, right?
- Totally.

552
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,267
Yeah, but my baby's a rebel.

553
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:37,269
No, no, no, no, she was
over-age when we met,

554
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:39,704
and we didn't start dating
until after she graduated...

555
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:40,907
...college.

556
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,708
Whatever, man, save it for the judge.

557
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,711
You know what?

558
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:48,847
I'm guilty. I'm guilty, guilty as charged,

559
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:53,351
for being in love with the most
amazing woman on the planet, right?

560
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,253
Right?

561
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:55,621
Aw, thank you, sweetheart.

562
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:57,657
You guys are so sweet.

563
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,492
See, I... I just threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

564
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,461
- Ryan, you suck.
- Hey!

565
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:07,599
I'm kidding, alright? It is sweet, it is.

566
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,901
To Kim and Collin,

567
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:13,238
good friends, good couple,

568
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
good for each other.

569
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:17,842
I love you guys.

570
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:20,479
Here, here!

571
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:22,615
- Righty, baby?
- Yes, sir.

572
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:26,251
Ooh, right, okay. That
would be my cue to exit.

573
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:30,222
Alright, since you guys are so lame,
I'm gonna make my own scary story.

574
00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:32,825
Once, there was a... tree.

575
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:35,728
Holly, yo. G-Give me the camera.

576
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,963
Why?

577
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:40,298
Man, no fun for Holly.

578
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,001
Shit, shit! H-Holly,
Holly, did you see that?

579
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:45,503
What? No, where?

580
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:47,807
- No... You're freaking me out.
- Look!

581
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:48,974
Right there!

582
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:51,276
Oh, shit, Collin, let's go.

583
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:53,912
Let's get the fuck outta here.

584
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:57,383
- Ry!
- Ryan! Baby!

585
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:59,584
- There's something in the woods.
- We saw something.

586
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:01,887
- Sasquatch?
- No, no, honestly, I think we should probably go.

587
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,456
- It's a creature or something.
- What?

588
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,691
There was some crea...
It jumped into the tree!

589
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,927
What was... It was an animal.

590
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,595
I'm too drunk and tired for this.

591
00:37:10,597 --> 00:37:11,997
Ryan, Ryan, we need to go!

592
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:13,599
There's no animal that moves like that.

593
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:19,972
I think you're spazzing
out just a little bit.

594
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:22,041
I'm not spazzing out! You
didn't see we what we saw!

595
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:24,409
- I need to know what you saw.
- I don't know!

596
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,845
- I'm not moving, everybody.
- Ryan, I don't know what it was!

597
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,813
Okay, well, exactly, you
don't know what it was!

598
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:30,215
That's why we're not gonna leave here!

599
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:32,617
If he's gonna be a shit, make
him think we're leaving him.

600
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:33,719
Collin, this is kind of crazy.

601
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,320
We're just supposed to
leave all of our stuff here?

602
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:38,523
Honey, please, I'll play back the
tape so you can see for yourself.

603
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:39,691
Turn, turn the engine on.

604
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:40,559
No, wait, wait, Collin!

605
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:43,362
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!

606
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:45,630
Stop! Are you fucking serious?

607
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:46,932
Fucking get in the car, man!

608
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,635
This is fucking crazy! We're
really gonna fucking leave now?

609
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:51,503
Just come on, man, I'm
not gonna tell you again.

610
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:52,671
Okay, fine!

611
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,372
We're gonna sit here and
leave a fire burning like this?

612
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:55,541
Ryan, you asshole, get in the fucking car!

613
00:38:05,585 --> 00:38:07,787
Holly, goddammit, no!

614
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:18,033
Ryan. Fuck.

615
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:20,735
Ryan...

616
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,871
Fuck!

617
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:31,409
It's coming closer!

618
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:38,483
- Slow down!
- I can't!

619
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,952
Use the brakes!

620
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,025
- He's dead, alright?!
- Holly, he's in pieces!

621
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:48,126
What the fuck was that?!

622
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,803
- Brake!
- Oh, my God!

623
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,779
Watch out, watch out!

624
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,847
I've been every which way
on every fucking channel,

625
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,648
I can't find...

626
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,186
What the hell?

627
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,957
Duncan?

628
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,228
Shit...

629
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:25,597
What the hell?

630
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,436
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

631
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:07,776
Oh, God.

632
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,746
You guys okay? You guys okay?

633
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,079
Oh, Jesus...

634
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,514
Oh, God.

635
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:17,583
Jesus, Kimmy.

636
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:19,921
Baby, baby, you okay?

637
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:22,921
Oh, God.

638
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,824
Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

639
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,492
Oh, God.

640
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:28,494
Holly.

641
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:31,197
- Are you alright?
- I killed that guy...

642
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,566
No, nobody's dead, nobody's dead.

643
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:35,934
- I'm gonna go get Ryan.
- Nobody's dead.

644
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,670
Holly, stay in the car, stay in the car!

645
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,304
Stay in the car!

646
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:42,641
No, you didn't kill him! You
didn't kill anybody, okay?

647
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:45,113
Everybody's fine.

648
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:48,715
Stay in the car!

649
00:40:48,717 --> 00:40:50,816
I'm gonna go check on
him. Just say in the car.

650
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,687
Stay in the car. Okay.

651
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:08,967
Hey, buddy? Buddy!

652
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,802
You okay?

653
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:13,271
What the f... What the fuck?

654
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:21,579
Hey!

655
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:23,548
- Where's Holly?
- Holly?

656
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,717
Where's... oh, God, we
gotta get outta here!

657
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,621
Babe, we gotta get outta here!

658
00:41:28,623 --> 00:41:31,624
- Where's the car, eh?
- Holly!

659
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:33,858
Okay, baby, it's gonna
get real bright, okay?

660
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:39,130
Baby, I know, I know. It's okay...

661
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:40,932
Where's... Holly?!

662
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,000
Honey, where's...

663
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,067
Holly, Holly?

664
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,904
Ryan...

665
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:47,406
Ryan...

666
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:50,674
- Oh, we just left him...
- I know, I know, there was nothing...

667
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,743
Shut the fuck up! We just left him!

668
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:55,547
- Holly, there was nothing we could do, okay?!
- We have to go back!

669
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:57,047
There's no way he made it, okay?

670
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:59,750
- Whatever it was, it just tore him up.
- Shut up, shut up.

671
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:01,618
Hey, hey, hey, listen.

672
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,886
No! No!

673
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,656
Kimmy...

674
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:09,127
Baby, I know, just hold
still, okay? Please.

675
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:11,194
We gotta get help, we gotta get help.

676
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,698
Holly.

677
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,869
Try mine, try mine.

678
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:20,672
- G-Gotta go back and get Ryan.
- Anything?

679
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:23,241
Well, we can't stay here! Kim!

680
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:27,011
Holly, we gotta get her outta here.

681
00:42:27,013 --> 00:42:29,681
Holly, we gotta get her outta here, okay?

682
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,015
Just help me with Kim for now.

683
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,984
We gotta move, baby, okay?

684
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,988
Fuck!

685
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:39,890
Holly, I can really use your help, okay?

686
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:42,195
Fuck, Holly! Help me!

687
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:48,869
Christ, Dunk, where the hell are ya, buddy?

688
00:43:04,183 --> 00:43:06,116
Can anybody hear me?

689
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:13,024
Anybody out there?

690
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:17,361
Please!

691
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:23,701
Motherfucker! Mother fuck you!

692
00:43:23,703 --> 00:43:26,974
You piece of fucking shit! Goddammit!

693
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:40,051
Oh, fuck.

694
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:41,988
Oh, fuck...

695
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:45,390
That was really smart, Trevor.

696
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:48,125
That's really fucking, that's
really gonna help your situation.

697
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,035
Duncan!

698
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:14,951
Shine the light over there.

699
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,187
- It's some sort of cabin.
- It's a house!

700
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:20,193
Come on, baby, just a little bit further.

701
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:24,263
Hope they have a phone and hope it works.

702
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,864
It's open.

703
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,033
Hello?

704
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:30,435
Hello? Anybody?

705
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:32,803
Hey, we need help!

706
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:34,307
Hello?

707
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:40,479
Hello?

708
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,920
Okay, just rest, okay?

709
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:50,020
Alright. Okay.

710
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:53,324
- Do you hear that?
- What, baby? There's nothing.

711
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:55,493
- There's something scratching.
- Baby, I didn't hear anything.

712
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:58,361
- Okay?
- No, baby, don't.

713
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,933
Collin! Come up here! Come on!

714
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:03,134
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Did you hear that?

715
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:04,338
Just rest.

716
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:21,252
Collin? Collin, over here! Hurry!

717
00:45:21,254 --> 00:45:23,221
You know how to work one of these?

718
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,522
How the fuck should I know?

719
00:45:24,524 --> 00:45:28,091
- I've never even seen one before.
- Okay, well, it can't be hard.

720
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:29,960
Okay... Hello?

721
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:32,395
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

722
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,367
Anyone copy?

723
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:38,069
- Fucking thing doesn't even work.
- What? It's on, right?

724
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,237
It's on... I-I don't...

725
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,239
Try another knob. Try... get the volume.

726
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,875
Try the volume.

727
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:48,312
Anybody copy?

728
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:57,955
What's that?

729
00:45:57,957 --> 00:46:00,260
T-Try another channel.

730
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:04,295
Try another channel!

731
00:46:04,297 --> 00:46:05,495
Okay.

732
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:11,002
It's the same weird static
on every one of these.

733
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:13,472
I've never even heard of that before.

734
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:20,812
Holly, holy shit, look at this.

735
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:23,216
What the hell is that?

736
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:28,518
Are you crazy?! No!
Don't open that, Collin!

737
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,323
Collin!

738
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:44,071
Oh, God!

739
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:53,978
Kim, Kim, Kim!

740
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:58,250
Come on, come on!

741
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:01,451
Go, go!

742
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:04,523
Hurry up! Go, Kim, go, Kim! Go!

743
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:12,263
So, been a while since
we last saw each other.

744
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:14,633
I don't know why, but...

745
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:22,208
I just can't seem to get my bearings right.

746
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:26,344
I just...

747
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:28,312
What was that?

748
00:47:28,314 --> 00:47:30,614
What the hell?! Shit!

749
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:42,460
Ahh! Oh, Goddammit!

750
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:45,196
I can't move!

751
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:47,163
I can't feel nothing!

752
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:49,201
My God!

753
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:50,428
- God, Holly, wait up!
- Keep up, guys!

754
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,330
She's got a concussion, alright?!

755
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,498
We can barely keep up. I need a break, too!

756
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,134
We've gotta stay together.
We gotta get back to the road.

757
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:58,402
How do you know where the road is?!

758
00:48:58,404 --> 00:49:01,439
Collin, I don't know. I know
we just need to get back.

759
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,455
Kim!

760
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:19,723
Collin!

761
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,625
Kim!

762
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:24,594
Hey! Hey!

763
00:49:24,596 --> 00:49:27,367
Kim, is she... is she...

764
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:33,770
I don't know...

765
00:49:33,772 --> 00:49:37,341
I don't know.

766
00:49:37,343 --> 00:49:40,210
I can't... I can't find her.

767
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:42,346
She's gone!

768
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:44,684
She's fucking gone!

769
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,719
Kim!

770
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:54,294
Look, we're gonna find her,
we're gonna find her, just...

771
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:58,763
Kimmy!

772
00:49:58,765 --> 00:50:00,364
Collin!

773
00:50:07,473 --> 00:50:09,242
Collin, wait up!

774
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,358
Okay.

775
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:28,695
Shit.

776
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:51,818
Oh, shit.

777
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,627
It's quiet.

778
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:05,898
It's too quiet.

779
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,873
No way up.

780
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,278
No way down.

781
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:24,549
I've lost my fucking center of gravity.

782
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:32,257
Fuck, where the hell
did that old man get to?

783
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:36,761
Duncan!

784
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,266
Come on out now!

785
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,803
Come on out, fun's over!

786
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,708
I ain't seen him for hours, I...

787
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,912
You'll see him, he's...

788
00:51:55,914 --> 00:51:59,284
He thinks it's fucking
funny to hide from me.

789
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:03,022
Fucking prick.

790
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,392
Ahh!

791
00:52:10,762 --> 00:52:13,431
Okay, see, it goes like this.

792
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,620
Alright?

793
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:44,897
Alright, then they talk
to each other, like this.

794
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:56,541
Maybe it's like... this.

795
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:19,262
Fuck!

796
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:31,677
Nah, it's all fucking wrong.

797
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:35,413
It's all fucking wrong.

798
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:39,784
Just gotta start over,
just fucking start over.

799
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:46,991
And this time, you don't
get to fucking watch!

800
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,825
Kim?

801
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:52,394
Collin?

802
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,931
Stay calm.

803
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,867
- Kim?
- Holly?

804
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,972
Collin! You scared the shit outta me!

805
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,076
There's something not right here.

806
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:09,415
That's why I can't focus.

807
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,383
Wait, I hear it for a
second, and then it's gone.

808
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:17,287
What are you hearing?
I can't hear anything!

809
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:19,491
- Any sign of Kim?
- Shh, shh, shh.

810
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,925
Listen, did you hear that?

811
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,462
Listen!

812
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:30,832
I can't hear shit! C-Collin, come on.

813
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,438
Come on, you're freaking me out.

814
00:54:35,307 --> 00:54:38,474
No! Collin!

815
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,343
Right here.

816
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:43,079
- They've come for their friend.
- Who's co...

817
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:45,948
Collin! No, come back here! Come back!

818
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,383
No, you can't leave me here, Collin!

819
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,785
Collin!

820
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,354
Collin!

821
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:57,161
Collin? Where'd you go?

822
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,632
Collin?

823
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,934
Where'd you go?

824
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,768
This is zero hour for me.

825
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,842
I'm being tested.

826
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,147
My ring of fire.

827
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,152
I pass, and I live.

828
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:59,524
I fail...

829
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:04,795
Well, we've seen what this thing can do.

830
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:10,968
It's like the...

831
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:14,102
...Spartans,

832
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,671
Apaches,

833
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,840
and the Samurai

834
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:21,178
all rolled into one.

835
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,987
Everything...

836
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:34,259
My whole life...

837
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:40,095
...comes down to this moment right here,

838
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:42,301
right now.

839
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:53,144
Kill or be fucking killed.

840
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,917
Law of the jungle.

841
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,054
Simple as that.

842
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,163
Alright.

843
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,634
Hunts on, fuckers!

844
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,976
Okay, okay.

845
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:28,544
It's gonna be fine.

846
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:30,111
I'm gonna find a way out.

847
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,984
It's gonna be fine.

848
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,321
Oh, my God! A trailer!

849
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:43,024
Hello?

850
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,727
Hello!

851
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:46,398
Someone there?

852
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:59,140
That's weird.

853
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:03,982
One moment I'm hot. Another
one, I'm freezing cold.

854
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:11,720
The clock on my phone says 4:45,

855
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:14,724
so just another hour or so
until the sun should be start...

856
00:58:14,726 --> 00:58:16,962
coming up..

857
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:21,800
I have no food and no water.

858
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,001
I'm so tired.

859
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:27,102
I'm so...

860
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:29,107
...thirsty.

861
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,010
It was...

862
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:38,850
It was more than three hours
ago since I last saw Collin.

863
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:43,019
I have this horrible feeling...

864
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:47,426
...like maybe the sun will
never come up, you know?

865
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:54,063
Whatever that thing was that attacked us...

866
00:58:54,065 --> 00:58:57,069
Whatever... I can't...

867
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,970
I can't...

868
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:02,305
God.

869
00:59:02,307 --> 00:59:05,173
My mind's real foggy.

870
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,374
It's like

871
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,714
I can't remember what I was
just thinking a second ago.

872
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,182
Ryan...

873
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:17,919
Oh, Ryan!

874
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,356
I love you.

875
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:27,762
I don't think I realized that until
now, but I really fucking love you.

876
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,631
If anybody...

877
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:31,934
...would find this...

878
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:34,105
Whatever happens...

879
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:37,372
To my Mom and Dad,

880
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:40,376
James and Margaret Powell

881
00:59:40,378 --> 00:59:43,047
on thirty-five...

882
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,449
Fuck.

883
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:50,952
Thirty-five, twenty-five
East Pine Lane,

884
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,088
Jeffersonville, New York.

885
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,990
I love you both,

886
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,793
so, so much.

887
00:59:57,795 --> 01:00:02,264
To Ryan's mom and stepdad...

888
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,101
To Kim and Collin's family...

889
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:07,169
I wish I could explain what's going on.

890
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:11,176
I wish I know something... I
can't, I can't, I don't know.

891
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,252
God said, "Let us make man in our image,

892
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:26,388
after our likeness,

893
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:30,091
and let him have dominion
over the fish of the sea,

894
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:32,793
and over the fowl of the air,

895
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,864
and over the cattle,
and over all the earth,

896
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:40,137
and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth."

897
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,808
Alright, now.

898
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:51,381
What I got to show you now is
something truly illuminating.

899
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,784
I know it don't look like much,

900
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:59,087
but this here...

901
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,225
...is a blood trail.

902
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:10,434
yeah, this here ain't nothing good.

903
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,735
Not natural.

904
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,441
Not bright like it should be.

905
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,246
It's black.

906
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,947
Like the blood from the heart,

907
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,253
but even darker still.

908
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:34,057
Dark blood of a dark prey.

909
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:43,263
You bring hell to me, demon,

910
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:46,970
and I'll bring it right back at
ya, you fucking night stalker.

911
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,909
I can hear you breathe.

912
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:57,147
I can hear your thoughts.

913
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:01,451
I'm inside you!

914
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:07,221
Look what we got here.

915
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,757
More tell-tells?

916
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:13,963
Oh, damn, you're gushin'
like a sieve, ain't ya, boy.

917
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,407
Whoa!

918
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,141
You're not who I'm lookin' for.

919
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:31,946
Hey, hey, hey there,
you don't look so mean.

920
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:35,350
You're alive, ain't you?

921
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,851
Can you talk?

922
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,657
What?

923
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:49,830
Damn it, you tryin' to say something?
What, what does that even fuckin' mean?

924
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:53,467
Hey!

925
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,273
No more pictures, you start talking!

926
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,975
Hey!

927
01:03:03,245 --> 01:03:05,947
What're you doing?! Ahh! Stop it!

928
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,216
Fucking stop it!

929
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,255
As you can see,

930
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:52,092
the sun is finally up.

931
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:53,594
I'm so thirsty.

932
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:59,333
That was my first priority,
gotta find some water.

933
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,704
I gotta find a way back home.

934
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,107
<i>Collin!</i>

935
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,310
Collin! Collin!

936
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,081
Collin!

937
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:16,120
Hey.

938
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:33,670
Collin?

939
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,073
Collin?

940
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,641
Hey.

941
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:43,580
I need you to repeat what
you just said to me, okay?

942
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,346
Please, Collin.

943
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:50,418
You said you know something,
you-you been somewhere.

944
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,087
You know what's been going on here.

945
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,623
- You need to tell me!
- There was an accident.

946
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,391
What-What accident?

947
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,060
It wasn't supposed to happen.

948
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,462
None of this.

949
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,263
I... I don't understand.

950
01:05:03,265 --> 01:05:05,098
I've seen things.

951
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,201
They told me things.

952
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,540
What... Who told you?

953
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:14,007
An accident.

954
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:17,277
Like a nuclear meltdown of the cosmos,

955
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:19,279
an outbreak.

956
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:20,783
But it's okay.

957
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,551
I'm safe now.

958
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,722
What? How?

959
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,258
They can't hurt me.

960
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,496
But they can still hurt you.

961
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,536
Gunshots!

962
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:44,304
They seem to be coming...
coming form there.

963
01:05:44,306 --> 01:05:47,342
Oh, my God, whoever it
is, at least it's human.

964
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:49,710
Hello? Hey!

965
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,013
Hey, whoever you are, we need help!

966
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,449
Wait, Collin! Wait!

967
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:57,752
Help us!

968
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:01,188
Come on, fucker! Come out and play!

969
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,993
Plenty more where that came from!

970
01:06:04,995 --> 01:06:07,664
Goddammit, where are you?!

971
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:13,403
Fuckers are everywhere!
Gotta get to better ground!

972
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:31,652
Oh, what have we here?

973
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,724
There ya are.

974
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,435
Yeah, ya thirsty?

975
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,339
Everybody gets thirsty.

976
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,482
God damn.

977
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,418
Another quiet one?

978
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,355
Shit, girl, I was sure you were one of 'em.

979
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,223
Hey, don't look at me like that.

980
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:12,461
Come on, get up! I-I didn't mean it!

981
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,130
Shit, come on!

982
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:19,735
You had the right idea, though.

983
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:31,648
That you, Duncan?!

984
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,750
Hey.

985
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,518
Hey!

986
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,657
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

987
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:46,828
Hey, look, man, uh, I-I thought
I was the only one out here.

988
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:50,864
I'm pretty sure I just
iced your girlfriend.

989
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:53,701
It was a mistake. I didn't, I didn't...

990
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,703
What're you lookin' at
me like that for, huh?

991
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,705
Huh?!

992
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,475
Hell with you then.

993
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:17,325
Doctor Margo Thompson here with
a quick rundown of what we know.

994
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:21,628
We're still a long way from
making sense of all this.

995
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:25,534
I'm sending everything to
you on a coded frequency.

996
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:28,870
Got multiple enemies!

997
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,819
With all the variables that
we were dealing with here,

998
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:48,925
it seemed that containment
was our first priority.

999
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,468
What's even more of a puzzle

1000
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,973
is our one known survivor.

1001
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:10,777
A man who, for unexplained reasons,

1002
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,347
has escaped contamination,

1003
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,783
physically at least.

1004
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:19,719
Psychological damage was extensive,

1005
01:09:19,721 --> 01:09:23,658
which makes communication a real challenge.

1006
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,526
<i>Today is Wednesday, the
fifth of June, 2014.</i>

1007
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:29,596
<i>I'm here with Subject
31, Collin Dean Barstow.</i>

1008
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,830
<i>Subject has been given
400 milligrams of Haldol</i>

1009
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:33,566
<i>to stabilize his behavior.</i>

1010
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:36,403
<i>He appears removed, but
has been more responsive</i>

1011
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:40,539
<i>than in our previous attempts
to conduct this interview.</i>

1012
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:42,610
<i>Mr. Barstow?</i>

1013
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:45,781
<i>Collin?</i>

1014
01:09:48,849 --> 01:09:52,487
<i>I would really like you to
tell me what you remember.</i>

1015
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:55,221
What you remember?

1016
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:56,958
<i>Yes.</i>

1017
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,627
What you remember?

1018
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:03,766
<i>Anything? Anything at all?</i>

1019
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,535
<i>Collin, I need to know what you saw.</i>

1020
01:10:09,537 --> 01:10:12,504
<i>Under hypnosis, you
mentioned to Dr. Brenner...</i>

1021
01:10:12,506 --> 01:10:13,840
<i>quite an amazing story.</i>

1022
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:16,709
<i>You told her that, after your
friends and you were exposed,</i>

1023
01:10:16,711 --> 01:10:18,212
<i>that you were taken captive.</i>

1024
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,913
<i>And that you were even able to
establish a method of communication</i>

1025
01:10:20,915 --> 01:10:22,916
<i>with those who abducted you.</i>

1026
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,583
<i>That you were taken
out of the forest</i>

1027
01:10:24,585 --> 01:10:26,721
<i>and onto some kind of craft.</i>

1028
01:10:28,322 --> 01:10:29,556
I said that?

1029
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,958
<i>I have a recording of it right here.</i>

1030
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,597
<i>What about these?</i>

1031
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:50,980
<i>Collin, can you tell me
about these drawings?</i>

1032
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:59,019
<i>These symbols here?</i>

1033
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:01,320
My drawings...

1034
01:11:01,322 --> 01:11:02,689
<i>Right.</i>

1035
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,391
<i>What do they mean to you?</i>

1036
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,596
<i>Are they representative
of something that you saw?</i>

1037
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:12,532
<i>I'm gonna play you something here,</i>

1038
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,534
<i>and I need you to
tell me what it means.</i>

1039
01:11:17,705 --> 01:11:19,372
<i>Please, Collin,</i>

1040
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:20,940
<i>you said you know something.</i>

1041
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:23,476
<i>You-You been somewhere.</i>

1042
01:11:23,478 --> 01:11:25,878
<i>You know what's been going on here.</i>

1043
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,614
- <i>You need to tell me!</i>
- <i>There was an accident.</i>

1044
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:30,449
<i>Wh-What accident?</i>

1045
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:32,819
<i>It wasn't supposed to happen.</i>

1046
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,553
<i>None of this.</i>

1047
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:36,455
<i>I... I don't understand.</i>

1048
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:37,957
<i>I've seen things.</i>

1049
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:40,060
<i>They told me things.</i>

1050
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:44,064
<i>What... Who told you?</i>

1051
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,932
<i>And accident.</i>

1052
01:11:46,934 --> 01:11:50,002
Like a nuclear meltdown of the cosmos,

1053
01:11:50,004 --> 01:11:52,071
an outbreak.

1054
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:54,873
But it's okay.

1055
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,575
I'm safe now.

1056
01:11:56,577 --> 01:11:59,114
What? How?

1057
01:12:00,381 --> 01:12:01,948
They can't hurt me.

1058
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:06,685
<i>Do you remember saying that?</i>

1059
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:09,788
<i>Can you tell me what that means?</i>

1060
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:11,391
<i>Why you?</i>

1061
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,496
<i>What was it that made you safe?</i>

1062
01:12:16,697 --> 01:12:18,498
<i>Hey.</i>

1063
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,100
<i>Come on now.</i>

1064
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,571
<i>You gotta give me something here.</i>

1065
01:12:24,772 --> 01:12:27,106
They wanted to...

1066
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:29,110
<i>Go on.</i>

1067
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:33,680
They wanted to try and find it.

1068
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,618
To stop it.

1069
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:40,188
<i>Don't stop, Collin.
You're doing great.</i>

1070
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:51,998
<i>Collin? Come on. Come
back to me, buddy.</i>

1071
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,769
Collin?

1072
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:58,837
<i>Let's try something else.</i>

1073
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:01,841
<i>Hey, Kimmy!</i>

1074
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:05,544
<i>Time to wake up. Morning, baby.</i>

1075
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:07,012
Morning, hey.

1076
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:08,647
What are you doing?

1077
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:10,984
I'm watching you.

1078
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:14,020
Am I totally creeping you out or what?

1079
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:15,454
Pervert.

1080
01:13:15,456 --> 01:13:16,855
How long have you been filming me?

1081
01:13:16,857 --> 01:13:19,691
I don't know, 30, 40 minutes? Maybe less.

1082
01:13:19,693 --> 01:13:22,194
- So creepy.
- Uh-huh.

1083
01:13:22,196 --> 01:13:25,899
Hey, someone's camera-shy. Come on, baby.

1084
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,033
Give it to me.

1085
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,568
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1086
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,802
Give it.

1087
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:40,012
Kimmy...

1088
01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:43,650
<i>Yes, let's start with Kimberly.</i>

1089
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,721
<i>What happened to her?</i>

1090
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:53,892
<i>I know this is hard, Collin.</i>

1091
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:57,163
<i>It's also really important
that you tell me everything.</i>

1092
01:13:57,165 --> 01:13:58,931
<i>I need you to remember.</i>

1093
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:02,236
<i>We need to go back to
that place in the forest.</i>

1094
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,914
<i>Collin, what can you remember?</i>

1095
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:14,984
Everything.

1096
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,026
Okay...

1097
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,892
Hey, Kimmy?

1098
01:14:26,894 --> 01:14:29,596
Baby, can you come here for a sec?

1099
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,097
- Yeah?
- Hey, sexy.

1100
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:33,967
Who me?

1101
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,235
Yeah, you.

1102
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,936
Who else would I be talking about?

1103
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:40,006
I don't know, maybe one of those little
freshmen that I always see you drooling over.

1104
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,742
Aw, what? No.

1105
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:43,709
Come on, you...

1106
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:45,278
They've gotta know you
give out extra credit

1107
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,580
- to the girl with the sweetest ass.
- Whatever!

1108
01:14:48,582 --> 01:14:51,050
- Am I right?
- You're crazy.

1109
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:51,883
Really?

1110
01:14:51,885 --> 01:14:54,087
Yeah, you're crazy to think that I

1111
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:57,059
would ever be checking out any other girl.

1112
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:03,162
Oh, that's weird. I'm sorry.

1113
01:15:03,164 --> 01:15:04,530
What now?

1114
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:06,599
There's something digging into my back.

1115
01:15:06,601 --> 01:15:08,668
Ow.

1116
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,637
- Can you... Can you reach around...
- What is it?

1117
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:13,873
I don't know what it
is. It's digging into me.

1118
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:16,609
Is it a freshman?

1119
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:19,279
I'm serious! I'm serious!
It's not. It's weird.

1120
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,114
It's weird?

1121
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,080
Ow.

1122
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:24,152
And... Oh, I think you found it.

1123
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,490
Wonder what that could be, huh?

1124
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,430
Hey.

1125
01:15:36,764 --> 01:15:38,698
Kim?

1126
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,936
- Well?
- Well?

1127
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:45,939
Come on, you're killing me.

1128
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,310
This is how you ask?

1129
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:51,746
Marry me.

1130
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,819
Can I take that as a yes?

1131
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,186
Yes!

1132
01:16:01,188 --> 01:16:02,724
Yeah?

1133
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:09,764
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1134
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,074
You wanna see some crazy shit?

1135
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,910
I'll show you some crazy shit.

1136
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:34,156
That's some crazy shit.

1137
01:16:52,943 --> 01:17:02,943
