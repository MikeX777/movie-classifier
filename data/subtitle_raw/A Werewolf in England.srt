2
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,909
Keep her steady, Willie!

3
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:10,308
Bastard's driving
like a bloody madman.

4
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,876
Beast of a storm
brewin' up out there.

5
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:16,009
Perhaps a sign of God's
distaste at the injustice

6
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,842
being served here.

7
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:21,342
An innocent man shouldn't be
subjected to this cruelty.

8
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,042
If I hear one
more word about you

9
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:26,542
being a so-called innocent
man, young Mr. Whittock,

10
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:29,009
I'll shove this pipe so
far up your back crack

11
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:32,009
you'll burn your bastard
tongue chewing me 'baccie.

12
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,042
Innocent?

13
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:35,809
How do you figure that?

14
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:37,509
You admit to
murdering the bugger.

15
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,542
They caught you in
the act, Mr. Whittock.

16
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,342
I never said I killed a man.

17
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,876
I said I killed a monster.

18
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,076
That transformed into a
man after he was deceased.

19
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,308
Yes.

20
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:48,876
Yes, yes, very convenient.

21
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:52,442
This monster of yours appeared
as a man to everybody else.

22
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54,909
Just in time for the
lord and lady to discover

23
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:58,375
you'd decapitated their youngest
and most beloved nephew.

24
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:00,375
The thing was gonna
tear me limb from limb.

25
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:01,308
I had no choice.

26
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:03,575
That boy was a bloody pansy.

27
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:06,308
But he wasn't a boy
when I killed him.

28
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:09,442
I don't know how to explain
it, but I know what I saw.

29
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:12,776
What, what else do you suggest
gifted me this vile injury?

30
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,076
Rambunctious lover no doubt.

31
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,675
A woman did this to me?

32
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,475
I've had far worse done to
me in the throes of passion.

33
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,342
Almost lost me left bollock
during a vigorous affair

34
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,942
with Drusilla Douglas,
God rest her soul.

35
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,842
Went blind with
syphilis a month later

36
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,509
and fell down a wishing well.

37
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,942
She'd have to have
been pretty giant,

38
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,375
with the claws of a
lioness to do this.

39
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:33,709
Well you're an
ugly git Whittock,

40
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,776
and no doubt she was
a bit of a gargoyle.

41
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:37,076
We'll see what the
judge has to say.

42
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:40,342
Judge Thaddeus is a
cruel and impatient man.

43
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,876
He shan't be doing with
your whingeing lies.

44
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,909
I have all the papers
signed by all the witnesses.

45
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:48,009
Tomorrow morning you'll hang,

46
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,542
and I'll be glad of
the peace and quiet.

47
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:53,076
Me too, from
this wicked world.

48
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,509
Why the devil have we stopped?

49
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,375
Willie!

50
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,575
The horses are
spooked, Councilor.

51
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,308
They won't go on.

52
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:07,076
Well, whip the bastards
until they're un-spooked,

53
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:08,542
or I'll be forced
to come up there

54
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,642
and give you a whipping myself!

55
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:12,909
I got a court appearance
to attend tomorrow.

56
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,375
The storm is
getting worse, sir.

57
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,776
We must seek shelter
for the night.

58
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,442
Let's continue at
dawn when it's safer.

59
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,342
There's nowhere
to stay, Willie.

60
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,942
I know these woods, sir.

61
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:28,308
There's an old inn not far.

62
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:30,042
We turn off here.

63
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:32,609
Better to get there
before dark, sir.

64
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:36,375
Folks have been known to go
missing, whole groups of 'em.

65
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:37,909
Oh, very well.

66
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:39,876
Onwards!

67
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:16,742
No funny business from
you, you understand?

68
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,542
Thank you.

69
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,509
Best kept in a safe
place, don't you think?

70
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,375
Jesus, you're a
welcoming fella.

71
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:53,308
My name is Parish
Councilor Horrace Raycraft.

72
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:55,408
This here is my
coachman Willie Ryder,

73
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:59,342
and this sniveling delinquent
is a criminal I'm escorting

74
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,475
for his court trial.

75
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,942
Storm's preventing us
traveling any further tonight

76
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,742
so we was hoping you could
give us accommodation.

77
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:08,542
Three rooms, is it?

78
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:09,742
Just the two.

79
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:11,876
This one stays with me.

80
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:14,542
I can't sleep chained to
you, you smelly old bastard-

81
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,942
Please stop doing that.

82
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:21,042
What's his crime?

83
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,408
Murder.

84
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,776
Self defense.

85
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:27,408
Tomorrow he'll be executed.

86
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:30,509
Until then, he's
my responsibility.

87
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,776
I suppose you want
to come into the warm?

88
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,709
Wipe your boots on the way in.

89
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,375
Jesus, Willie, look
at this wallpaper.

90
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:54,408
I've left patterns
in me chamber pot

91
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,042
less grotesque than this.

92
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,942
Open a window every once
in a while do you ol' chap?

93
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:02,609
Let the odor escape.

94
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,308
Aha, unexpected guests.

95
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,509
I'm Martha Hogwood.

96
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,542
Welcome to the Three Claws.

97
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,642
Horrace Raycraft, and
this here is my coachman,

98
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:17,575
Willie Ryder.

99
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,342
Willie Ryder?

100
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,475
Why yes, he's the
finest in the county.

101
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,475
Pleasure gentlemen.

102
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,076
Now, don't let brother
scare you off, will you?

103
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:29,442
He's a little mentally-impaired.

104
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:31,076
It hadn't gone unnoticed.

105
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:33,342
Vincent and I manage
the inn together.

106
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,609
It's been our family
business for generations.

107
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:40,542
And a very fine establishment
it is, too, Miss Warthog.

108
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:41,442
Hogwood.

109
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,742
Precisely.

110
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,542
Well, I'll show you
up to our guest rooms,

111
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:46,709
if you'd care to follow.

112
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:50,909
Oh, Vincent, you'll take care
of their horses, won't you?

113
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:53,575
Their horses?

114
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:54,609
Yes.

115
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,308
Put them in the
stable out back.

116
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,542
I can do that, madam.

117
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,509
No, no, it's no trouble.

118
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,909
Vincent can manage.

119
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:01,776
Vincent can manage.

120
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,009
Come on up.

121
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,009
You haven't seen a young
lady on your travels,

122
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,609
have you anywhere, gentlemen?

123
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,575
One of our guests
left this morning

124
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,542
without settling her debt.

125
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,675
Haven't passed a
soul, I'm afraid, madam.

126
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:26,042
I'm afraid we're almost full
tonight, but you're in luck.

127
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:27,542
Just the
two rooms for us.

128
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,976
This murdering
scoundrel stays with me.

129
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,609
Murdering?

130
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,742
It's incredibly brave of you
to keep yourself attached

131
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:38,709
to a potentially violent
criminal, Mr. Raycraft.

132
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:42,542
Call
me Horrace, please.

133
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:45,609
One must be very courageous
in this profession.

134
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,575
Protecting vulnerable
ladies such as yourself

135
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:52,675
from the many vulgar
miscreants of society.

136
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,642
I'd be worried he'd sever my
arm from my body and escape.

137
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:57,642
What's that?

138
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,609
Wouldn't be difficult.

139
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:01,342
Dislocate the hand from
the wrist in the night

140
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,942
while you were sleeping.

141
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:06,909
Here, perfect lodgings
for your coachman.

142
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:15,709
I'm afraid the bed's a tad
lumpy since our last guest,

143
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:19,976
Lady Stillinfleet, died in her
sleep of a perforated bowel.

144
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:23,976
Thank you, madam.

145
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:32,042
We have the Reverend
Pankhurst of Hilperton

146
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,976
staying just across the hall.

147
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,575
Oh yes, we're very
particular about our guests

148
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,308
here at The Three Claws.

149
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:41,375
Oh, Minnie!

150
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:42,776
All done here, Miss Hogwood.

151
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:46,308
Shut the pissin'
door ya daft wench!

152
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:51,342
Oh, Jesus Christ, you got
mess all over the bed sheets.

153
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:57,809
Minnie is our
resident lady of the evening,

154
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:01,375
available to our guests at
just two pounds a night.

155
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,675
Minnie this is Mister Raycraft.

156
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,642
Uh, Parish Councilor Raycraft.

157
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,842
You like what
you see, Councilor?

158
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:12,709
I'll admit I've
got more than a slight tingle

159
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,642
in me nether-giblets.

160
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:18,976
Maybe Minnie can give you
some relief later tonight, no?

161
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,475
Please don't.

162
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,642
I'm sure that can be arranged.

163
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:25,876
This is your room at
the end of the hall.

164
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,408
Here, take this.

165
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:49,575
Hide it with the rest.

166
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,609
Victoria hasn't returned?

167
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:55,976
She's not coming back.

168
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,542
Something must have happened.

169
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,509
God help us.

170
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,742
She'll never make it back now.

171
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,308
There are bad things
in the woods, Jane.

172
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:03,742
We should have gone with them.

173
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:04,575
So what am I to do?

174
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:05,542
I can't go out there.

175
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,809
You promised to leave
before the blood moon.

176
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:08,842
It's almost dark!

177
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,776
I can't, Minnie.

178
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,709
The Three Claws will
not be safe tonight.

179
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:15,709
They've planned to have
them filled with guests

180
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,342
on the night of the blood moon

181
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,475
as if their lives
dependent on it.

182
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:22,609
Whatever they are up to,
I know it can't be good.

183
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,442
The new guests, they
brought transportation.

184
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,375
You could help me steal it.

185
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:28,809
He's the parish councilor.

186
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,742
You will be arrested
for thievery.

187
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,675
If I'm to believe
what you say,

188
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:34,842
perhaps I've no other choice.

189
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:39,009
Believe me,
Jane, for his sake.

190
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,742
Have been dealt with?

191
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,542
Under shelter for now.

192
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,876
He's the parish
councilor, Martha.

193
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:05,709
They're expecting him
in court tomorrow.

194
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:08,609
He's not some lowlife that
people will easily forget.

195
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:10,375
What do you suggest
we do then, brother?

196
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,375
We cannot break our pact.

197
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:13,809
They'll come looking for him.

198
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:15,976
The inn must be full.

199
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,375
These fools are a
gift from the storm.

200
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:22,675
Wheel their carriage
into a ditch and burn it.

201
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,442
Make it look like they've
steered off the road.

202
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,709
Nobody will suspect us.

203
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:29,509
And the horses?

204
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,475
Perhaps they'll
serve as an appetizer.

205
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,509
Jane, quickly!

206
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:24,942
♪ So we'll roll the
old chariot along ♪

207
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:28,842

00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,009
What madness is this?

218
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:02,575
Get outta my face,
you filthy, drunken pig!

219
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:06,809
You grumpy git,
you!

220
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:10,776
Cheer up, have a drink, get
settled in for the storm.

221
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,776
Aye, she's a brutal bitch.

222
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,942
And a blood moon
to go with her.

223
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:25,942
All the devilish ingredients
for an evenin' of sinister

224
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:29,509
and supernatural happenin's.

225
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,909
Pour yourselves
summat strong, boys,

226
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,342
and pray we make it
through till morning.

227
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,475
I'll be surprised
if he makes it

228
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,809
through the next 10 minutes.

229
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:41,042
So wrinkles, you got a name?

230
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,509
Horrace.

231
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,976
Horrace the hideous.

232
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,509
I'm Bernard Bagley,

233
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:52,308
and this is the Reverend
Gilbert Pankhurst.

234
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,675
Aye! Of Hilperton!

235
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,876
What about your attachment?

236
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:02,876
Archibald Whittock,
charged with murder.

237
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:07,876
Tomorrow he'll be
sentenced to death.

238
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,909
Then you should drink, boy.

239
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,475
Celebrate your last
night of livin'.

240
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,909
Do you always get
this drunk, Mr. Bagley?

241
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:18,408
I have to on a
night like this, son.

242
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:19,609
Calms me nerves.

243
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:21,909
Frightened of a
little storm, are you?

244
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:23,942
It's not the storm
that frightens me.

245
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:26,876
It's what's out
there in them woods.

246
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:30,542
You don't know where
you are, do you, lad?

247
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:35,009
This is Grittleton Marsh,

248
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:40,776
and there are legends
of Grittleton Marsh.

249
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,976
Its ancient woodlands
which spread for miles,

250
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,909
and the wicked beasts
who dwell within.

251
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:50,076
See one, I did, when
I was just a short lad.

252
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:53,042
And for me left eye, it was
the last thing it ever saw.

253
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,076
They're out there, wolves
like you ain't never seen.

254
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,575
Tall as men, and
strong as giants.

255
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:07,942
Wolves, you say?

256
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:11,776
Not just any wolves, foul
beasts crawled up from the

257
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:12,942
gizzards of hell.

258
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:16,575
What a load of
superstitious codswallop!

259
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,042
I said I seen them, sir!

260
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,776
Through the
bottom of a bottle.

261
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,742
There may well be
wolves in these parts,

262
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:24,709
but not as you describe them.

263
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,976
The only thing dangerous
within 50 miles

264
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,342
is this murdering ratbag.

265
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:33,275
And I've got him
under my guardianship.

266
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,642
Then here's to you, brave sir.

267
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:58,976
Sleep tight, Councilor.

268
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:03,275
Sweet dreams, Councilor.

269
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:06,642
Sleep tight, Councilor.

270
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,942
Sleep tight, Councilor.

271
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,809
The councilor wants to
see you in his room tonight.

272
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:34,976
I've already taken payment.

273
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,475
Ah ah, you'll get
your half tomorrow.

274
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:40,076
Now make sure you wear him out.

275
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:43,042
I need every man in this
inn sleeping like the dead.

276
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,909
But it's so
late, Miss Hogwood.

277
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,442
Maybe I'm worn out.

278
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:49,308
Don't forget who's keepin'
a roof above your head,

279
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:52,308
you ungrateful gutter whore.

280
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,675
Now do as you're told!

281
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:56,942
The only reason why
men come to this pigpen

282
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,709
is to spend a night with me.

283
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:03,308
So perhaps it is I keeping
a roof over your head.

284
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:07,542
You know tonight's a
special night, Minnie.

285
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:11,642
We pay you well to
draw 'em in, do we not?

286
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,542
Was that not the arrangement?

287
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:18,542
Everything must go
according to plan,

288
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:22,976
otherwise you will not
like the repercussions.

289
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,408
You don't scare me.

290
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:29,742
It's not me you
need to be afraid of.

291
00:18:57,342 --> 00:18:59,776
Go on lovely,
like you mean it.

292
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:04,475
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's
the spot, darling.

293
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,342
That's it!

294
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:11,375
Jesus, oh,

295
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:17,675
Oh, yeah, yeah.

296
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,742
Oh God, yes, yes, yes, yes.

297
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:29,009
Yes, yes, oh.

298
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,375
Oh, Jesus Christ!

299
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,408
Stop your moaning
and go to sleep.

300
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,909
You're
rusting me saw.

301
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:50,475
It's hardly getting
through the bone.

302
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,308
You gotta put
your back into it.

303
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:54,009
I am, woman.

304
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:54,842
I am.

305
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,475
Pass me the head.

306
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:06,442
Don't let it drip everywhere,

307
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,909
you're gonna stain
the furniture.

308
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:13,675
What's that noise?

309
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:15,308
Somebody's there!

310
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,675
Lord, look upon me
with eyes of mercy.

311
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,408
May your mighty power w
into every inch of my body

312
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,675
and into the depths of my soul.

313
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,042
Guide me and give me strength

314
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:27,809
to make it through
this dark night.

315
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,675
Somebody's awake.

316
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,575
Did they see us?

317
00:24:57,408 --> 00:25:02,342
Oh, Miss Hogsbottom, absorb
me in your pillowy bosom.

318
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,308
Mr. Raycraft.

319
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:08,675
Mr. Raycraft, wake up!

320
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:12,575
Oh, snuck in for a ride on
old horny Horrace have ya,

321
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,308
you saucy minx?

322
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:22,542
Jesus wept!

323
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:25,076
Your breath stinks like piss!

324
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,809
Please Mister
Raycraft, listen!

325
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:27,942
It's the innkeepers.

326
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,642
They've killed
Willie, butchered him!

327
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:30,842
Butchered?

328
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,575
They intend to murder
us all, I heard it.

329
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:34,809
They're chopping the
guests into pieces.

330
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:38,342
What the bloody hell?

331
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,609
Why you little rascal,
you're trying to escape!

332
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:41,509
No!

333
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,342
I mean, yes, I was, but-

334
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,609
- Right, that does it.

335
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,609
Oh, you dirty little bastard.

336
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:55,842
It wasn't altogether
pleasant for either of us.

337
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:56,876
I warned you.

338
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,542
Now shut up, old
man, and listen.

339
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,742
Calm down.

340
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,709
I saw with my own
eyes those incubus

341
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:07,308
dismembering your coachman,

342
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:08,408
and plotting aloud
to do the same to us.

343
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,675
Poppycock!

344
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:10,809
Go and see for yourself.

345
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:14,642
I'm not lying, sir.

346
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:16,609
Dismembered you say?

347
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,776
And you came back
to warn me, did ye?

348
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:22,575
It's an unlikely story.

349
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:23,942
Just because it's
an unlikely story

350
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:26,342
doesn't mean it isn't the truth.

351
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,742
Promise to believe me,

352
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:30,542
or I'll go ahead and
prevent your suffering.

353
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,842
It is the merciful thing to do-

354
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:33,542
- Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

355
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:34,542
hold your giblets.

356
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:37,976
Just pass me the gun, lad.

357
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:40,609
We'll go and see if Willie
really has been murdered.

358
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:45,575
Fine, but I'm keeping the gun.

359
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:52,275
Oh, you bugger.

360
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:39,742
Vincent, what are you
doing with the head?

361
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:42,076
I thought you had it.

362
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,776
I told you to
chuck it in after the legs.

363
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:00,642
Shh!

364
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,909
Did you hear
something, brother?

365
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:06,709
Upstairs.

366
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,675
Was there something
you needed, Mr. Raycraft?

367
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:19,375
Miss Hogwood,

368
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:24,776
I'm placing you and your
brother under arrest for,

369
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:30,675
for murder, and I must insist
that you come peacefully

370
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:33,709
with me to the magistrates'
court immediately

371
00:28:33,742 --> 00:28:38,742
or I'll have no choice
but to use deadly force.

372
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:43,542
And how do you plan to
take us away, Mr. Raycraft?

373
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:48,976
We've butchered your horses,
murdered your coachman,

374
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:52,776
and there's no getting away
from the Three Claws tonight

375
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:57,542
nor any night!

376
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:58,776
My gun, Archie!

377
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:00,909
Quickly lad!

378
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:04,675
Jesus woman, you could have

379
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:06,709
had my bloody head
off with this.

380
00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:17,509
Get off me you
fucking mad bitch!

381
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:20,575
Jesus!

382
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,842
Shoot her, Archie!

383
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,909
Get this made bitch off me!

384
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:52,408
No, her!

385
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:55,609
Sorry!

386
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:30,375
Come here sweetness, we're
dismembering the guests.

387
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:44,509
What's all this
bastardin' racket?!

388
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,308
I'm totally shagged
and barely had an hour

389
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:47,475
of me beauty sleep!

390
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,976
Fine!

391
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,842
Be as loud as you want,

392
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,542
but I'm leaving this stank hole
first thing in the morning!

393
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,809
Archie!

394
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,442
Archie, where's me pistol?

395
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,909
Help me untie these knots!

396
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:03,475
Sorry, lad.

397
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:21,442
Thank you.

398
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:23,009
I'm sure you'll think of
some way you can repay me.

399
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,742
Actually, I've got
something specific in mind

400
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:27,609
which involves all three of us,

401
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,909
and they ropes may
come in useful.

402
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,342
Get out of the way!

403
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:51,509
Horrace!

404
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:13,009
Hurry up, man!

405
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,408
You're stressing me out!

406
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:35,809
Martha!

407
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:40,609
My Martha, no!

408
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:49,809
Vincent Hogwood, I'm
placing you under arrest.

409
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,308
Archie, tie him up!

410
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:04,909
What did I miss?

411
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:16,042
These two scoundrels thought
they could get away with

412
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:20,976
murdering every last
one of us in our sleep.

413
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:23,909
What reason, exactly,

414
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:26,342
I only shudder to imagine.

415
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,976
Luckily, I saw through
their dastardly scheme

416
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:32,308
almost the minute I
stepped through the doors

417
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:34,375
of this unholy hovel.

418
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,642
All evening I lay in wait to
outsmart this foolish pair.

419
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:42,976
And when heard a
disturbance in the night,

420
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:48,009
I did what I had to, and I
saved every single one of us

421
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:51,575
from certain death.

422
00:35:53,076 --> 00:35:54,742
You didn't save
your coachman, though.

423
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:56,809
You let them chop
him up into pieces.

424
00:35:56,842 --> 00:36:00,375
Aye, chopped to pieces!

425
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:04,776
Well yes, I had to confirm
me theory was correct.

426
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,009
But now you've
got no coachman-

427
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:09,076
- All right, Windy Wallace,
let's not interrupt.

428
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:11,542
You owe me your lives,
that's what matters.

429
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:13,809
You're all gonna
die, Councilor,

430
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:18,809
a far more grizzly
and petrifying death

431
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:21,809
than what my sister and
I would have granted you.

432
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:26,475
You don't know what you've done.

433
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:29,076
You do not frighten
us, Mr. Hogface.

434
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:32,076
It's not me you need to fear.

435
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:36,009
All our lives, my sister and
I have kept an agreement,

436
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:40,842
an agreement with the vicious
beasties of these woods.

437
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:45,275
Unlike any creature you've ever
seen or heard of, Councilor.

438
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:51,275
Half man, half wolf,
all bloodthirsty rage.

439
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:58,509
For generations we've kept
a pact that's protected us.

440
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:02,342
A truce between man and monster.

441
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,876
What sort of pact?

442
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:07,076
Every blood moon,
when the inn is full,

443
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:09,742
we make an offering.

444
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:12,342
All the guests of
the Three Claws,

445
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,876
all the lowlifes and drunkards,

446
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:17,876
hiding from their
damnable pasts.

447
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,909
They all die at our hands.

448
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:25,442
'Til the next blood moon,
the beasts leave us in peace.

449
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:29,509
Well, how often's
a blood moon?

450
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:31,709
- Every three, four years.
- Six, seven months.

451
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:35,442
It's a small price to pay
for a life free of fear,

452
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:38,909
or dread of being
disemboweled by their claws,

453
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:41,675
or devoured by their teeth.

454
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:45,042
Well, we have Willie,
and we have your sister.

455
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:45,976
There's an offering.

456
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:47,442
It's not enough.

457
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:51,575
Six bodies for three
beasts, that's the deal.

458
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:53,876
There's three
of these savages?

459
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:56,609
And you'd better not
let them go hungry.

460
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:57,542
Well, there's you.

461
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,076
That takes it up to three.

462
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,408
They'll come here
with a vengeance.

463
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:04,642
Well, perhaps it's all
just deluded superstition,

464
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:06,308
Mr. Hogwood.

465
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:10,876
You and your sister are
a truly demented duo.

466
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:14,609
Perhaps there's no other
explanation for your blood lust.

467
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,709
What if he's telling
the truth, Horrace?

468
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:18,308
What if they are out there?

469
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:19,342
I've seen 'em.

470
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,243
They exist.

471
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:22,575
Then we send an
offering, like he says,

472
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:25,408
and pray it will suffice.

473
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:26,275
Fine.

474
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,408
You can chop her into bits

475
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:43,375
and we'll make the
bloody offering.

476
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,009
Do it, man!

477
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,609
Not me own sister,
Councilor, please.

478
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:51,876
Do as he says, Vincent.

479
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,976
I'm sorry, Martha.

480
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,009
Eww.

481
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:21,542
Ooh.

482
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,042
Thank God you found us.

483
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:32,675
We couldn't have
left the rest of you.

484
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:33,542
Here.

485
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,408
This might sting.

486
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:42,475
Sorry.

487
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:43,609
Sorry.

488
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,675
It's all right.

489
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:46,442
It's all right.

490
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:00,609
Thank you for taking care of me.

491
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:02,408
It's the least
I could do, sir.

492
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,876
Archie.

493
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:04,909
Whittock.

494
00:40:04,942 --> 00:40:06,076
Jane.

495
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:08,442
It's a pleasure.

496
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:11,942
What are they going
to do to him down there?

497
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,542
I'm not sure.

498
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:14,442
Arrest him.

499
00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:15,742
They should kill him.

500
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:17,475
Like he killed those horses.

501
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,542
What?

502
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:21,076
There's no way
of escaping here.

503
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,842
We will have to wait until
morning and head out on foot.

504
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:26,709
Where are you heading off to?

505
00:40:26,742 --> 00:40:27,709
She's on the run.

506
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:33,442
From whom, if you
don't mind my asking?

507
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:35,475
My parents.

508
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:39,575
Those who know me back home.

509
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,609
Archie, if I show you something,

510
00:40:48,642 --> 00:40:49,475
do you promise to
keep it a secret?

511
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:50,909
Jane, no.

512
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:52,408
I can trust him, Minnie.

513
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:54,642
Perhaps he can help us.

514
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:56,308
You have my word.

515
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:22,809
My God.

516
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,076
It's yours.

517
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:26,642
He is.

518
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:27,909
His name's Edgar.

519
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,575
What's he doing in
the bloody wardrobe?

520
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:30,776
Hiding.

521
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:31,976
No inn would have me.

522
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:34,475
Not with Edgar.

523
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:37,909
And I can't risk anyone
finding us or following us.

524
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:39,009
Where's his father?

525
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:42,342
There's no father.

526
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,442
Just a cruel man
from a cruel night.

527
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:46,542
Men.

528
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:57,942
I never asked for
this child, Archie.

529
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:01,642
Now that I have him, nobody's
gonna come between us.

530
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:05,842
He's all I have.

531
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,076
Shh, it's all right.

532
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,675
It's all right, Mommy's here.

533
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,942
Please forgive
me, oh mighty beast,

534
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:30,809
for this is all I could
bring, oh ancient one.

535
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,509
The inn is full
as you commanded,

536
00:43:34,675 --> 00:43:37,876
but these guests are
not so easy to kill.

537
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:41,942
I am old, master, and we have
served you for many years.

538
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:46,675
But I can't deliver
on our promise.

539
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:49,408
Go, feast on them.

540
00:43:49,442 --> 00:43:54,442
Take our inn for yourselves,
but I beg of you, spare me!

541
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:55,809
Please, spare me!

542
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,475
Have mercy, master!

543
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,042
Have mercy, God!

544
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:32,408
I don't think
he's coming back.

545
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,042
Is that you, Mr. Hogwood?

546
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,609
Did they accept me offering?

547
00:44:42,776 --> 00:44:44,909
That'll be a no, I reckon!

548
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:53,709
Run, men!

549
00:44:57,776 --> 00:44:59,976
We meet again,
bastard hound of Satan!

550
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:08,308
Oh, bugger that!

551
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:14,876
There's more of 'em!

552
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:41,442
No!

553
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:48,609
It's not gonna hold!

554
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:50,009
Take cover, lads!

555
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:33,842
What was that?

556
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:34,675
Stay here.

557
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:35,842
I go and look.

558
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:39,842
No, I'll go.

559
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:41,408
Hide the baby.

560
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:58,742
I think I just shat me pants.

561
00:50:15,842 --> 00:50:17,009
Minnie?

562
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:19,009
Don't make a sound.

563
00:50:27,342 --> 00:50:27,976
Hide.

564
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:30,809
What is it, Minnie?

565
00:50:30,842 --> 00:50:33,976
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

566
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:46,942
Shoot him, Horrace!

567
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:30,876
Get away from me you
ugly son of a bitch!

568
00:52:38,342 --> 00:52:38,942
Oh no!

569
00:52:38,976 --> 00:52:40,675
Not my eye!

570
00:52:40,709 --> 00:52:43,042
Oh God no, my eye!

571
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:43,909
My eye!

572
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:47,876
Bernard!

573
00:55:13,442 --> 00:55:14,642
Oh, Bernard!

574
00:55:14,675 --> 00:55:16,342
It's too late.

575
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,442
He's gone.

576
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:18,542
Help me!

577
00:55:18,575 --> 00:55:19,809
I'm still alive!

578
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,408
Well, there's nothing
we can do for him now.

579
00:55:25,076 --> 00:55:26,542
Aye.

580
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:28,475
God rest his soul.

581
00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:33,509
Someone come
and shoot the bloody thing!

582
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:34,475
Don't!

583
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:37,542
It'll be suicide.

584
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:22,009
Eat me!

585
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:23,575
Come and eat me!

586
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:44,342
It's all right.

587
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,042
We're safe in here.

588
00:58:46,909 --> 00:58:47,909
Archie no!

589
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:52,776
No!

590
00:59:20,709 --> 00:59:21,542
Archie!

591
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:31,976
Now we're safe.

592
00:59:56,942 --> 00:59:58,675
What happened to you?

593
00:59:58,709 --> 00:59:59,709
Don't ask.

594
01:00:56,709 --> 01:00:58,642
What devilry is this?

595
01:00:58,675 --> 01:01:02,609
Seems Bernard's tall
tales were true after all.

596
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,742
These were once men.

597
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:15,442
There's two dead,
one still out there.

598
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:17,742
No doubt he'll be
back to finish the job.

599
01:01:17,776 --> 01:01:19,475
And we'll be ready.

600
01:01:21,509 --> 01:01:22,709
Aye.

601
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,876
Barricade all the
doors and windows.

602
01:01:24,909 --> 01:01:28,009
If we can make it just one
more hour 'til sunrise,

603
01:01:28,042 --> 01:01:31,609
'til the blood moon sets,
then we may survive.

604
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:41,742
Minnie?

605
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:45,542
Oh God!

606
01:01:49,442 --> 01:01:50,342
She's gone.

607
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:54,042
You did what you could, lad.

608
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:54,909
Jane.

609
01:01:54,942 --> 01:01:56,308
Oh my God, Jane!

610
01:02:06,609 --> 01:02:07,442
Jane.

611
01:02:08,575 --> 01:02:09,408
It's all right.

612
01:02:09,442 --> 01:02:10,042
We're all right.

613
01:02:10,076 --> 01:02:11,642
Thank God.

614
01:02:11,675 --> 01:02:12,542
Where's Minnie?

615
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:19,076
It got her.

616
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:20,876
What the hell is that?

617
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:24,675
You can't bring a baby
into a place like this.

618
01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:25,809
Are you mad, woman?

619
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,009
I didn't know it
would be set upon

620
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:28,509
by flesh-hungry wolf monsters.

621
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:30,809
Werewolves is what they are.

622
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:33,575
Men who turn to beasts
under the spell of the moon.

623
01:02:33,609 --> 01:02:36,575
That is exactly what I
killed back in Eddington.

624
01:02:36,609 --> 01:02:38,342
Now do you believe me?

625
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:41,076
We need
your help, lad.

626
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:42,809
We need to barricade the place.

627
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,809
They'll be back for us.

628
01:02:44,842 --> 01:02:45,976
Will you be all right?

629
01:02:46,008 --> 01:02:47,308
Yes.

630
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:47,976
Go.

631
01:02:48,009 --> 01:02:49,675
Shout if you need me.

632
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:56,742

Help me.

646
01:04:36,076 --> 01:04:36,876
No.

647
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:38,375
Let me in.

648
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:40,442
No, don't listen, man.

649
01:04:40,475 --> 01:04:41,475
Let me in.

650
01:04:42,609 --> 01:04:44,709
It's just the
walls talking again.

651
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:47,375
Let me in.

652
01:05:00,042 --> 01:05:00,876
Bernard?

653
01:05:03,876 --> 01:05:04,709
Horrace!

654
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:06,709
It's Bernard!

655
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:08,976
He's alive!

656
01:05:14,342 --> 01:05:15,509
He can't be.

657
01:05:18,976 --> 01:05:20,942
What's happening to him?

658
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:24,542
Oh, God!

659
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:26,876
He's turning!

660
01:05:29,976 --> 01:05:31,575
He's become one of them.

661
01:05:38,009 --> 01:05:39,542
Minnie.

662
01:05:39,575 --> 01:05:40,675
Oh no!

663
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:41,809
Jane's alone up there!

664
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:53,909
Reverend, guard the entrance!

665
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,308
Bernard it's me, Gilbert!

666
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:34,009
You can't even remember Gilbert?

667
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:36,675
Have you come back for your rum?

668
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:40,475
You drank it all
ya daft bastard!

669
01:06:54,942 --> 01:06:55,976
No, no!

670
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:09,709
Minnie?

671
01:07:25,076 --> 01:07:25,976
How is she?

672
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:27,442
Incredibly hairy.

673
01:07:27,475 --> 01:07:29,776
Oh, that don't
seem like Minnie.

674
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:44,408
Run!

675
01:07:51,575 --> 01:07:52,575
Over here!

676
01:08:31,076 --> 01:08:32,942
In here!

677
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:39,408
You can hide.

678
01:08:39,442 --> 01:08:41,575
He can't reach you in there;
it's too small for him.

679
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,609
Archie!

680
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:46,342
I don't see what
choice we have.

681
01:08:47,575 --> 01:08:49,275
Hurry!

682
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,709
Oh my God!

683
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:11,809
Don't come out 'til
both beasts are dead.

684
01:09:11,842 --> 01:09:12,675
Go, lad!

685
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:10,342
No, no, no, no, no!

686
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:17,375
If you're looking for your
arm, you just missed it.

687
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:29,842
What's that?

688
01:10:29,876 --> 01:10:31,509
I'm not sure.

689
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:32,375
A mouse?

690
01:10:33,475 --> 01:10:35,509
It's a big mouse, Archie.

691
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:36,542
A rat, then?

692
01:10:36,575 --> 01:10:38,542
It's not a bloody rat.

693
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:05,776
That'll learn ya.

694
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:08,509
Bitch, go on, die!

695
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:13,308
And to think I fucked you!

696
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,542
You're still a
filthy, drunken pig.

697
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:20,709
Oi!

698
01:12:33,776 --> 01:12:35,642
It's all right, sweetheart.

699
01:12:35,675 --> 01:12:37,776
Mother will be back soon.

700
01:13:04,442 --> 01:13:05,275
Archie!

701
01:13:24,342 --> 01:13:24,976
Thanks.

702
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:34,942
No, no!

703
01:13:36,408 --> 01:13:37,509
Archie!

704
01:14:54,675 --> 01:14:59,009
Don't you even think about
it, you big, hairy bitch!

705
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:55,009
Archie.

706
01:15:58,542 --> 01:15:59,742
Archie, wake up.

707
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:00,609
Wake up!

708
01:16:01,976 --> 01:16:02,909
We did it!

709
01:16:02,942 --> 01:16:04,542
We got the last one.

710
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:06,642
It bit me, Jane.

711
01:16:06,675 --> 01:16:07,776
No, no, no, no,
no, you'll be e.

712
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:09,709
I'll clean you up.

713
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:14,742
I can feel it, the bite,
the hunger, controlling me.

714
01:16:18,442 --> 01:16:19,642
No, no, no, no, no.

715
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:22,009
No, don't leave me.

716
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:23,475
Don't leave me.

717
01:16:25,642 --> 01:16:26,675
Don't leave me.

718
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:22,675
"I will strengthen
you and help you.

719
01:17:24,942 --> 01:17:29,009
"I will uphold you with
my righteous right hand."

720
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:00,809
Archie!

721
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:01,642
Archie!

722
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:03,375
Get back, it's begun!

723
01:18:05,675 --> 01:18:06,842
I'm sorry, lad.

724
01:18:06,876 --> 01:18:07,909
No, don't!

725
01:18:07,942 --> 01:18:09,709
Look at him; he's been bitten!

726
01:18:09,742 --> 01:18:11,742
He's gonna turn into
one of them beasts.

727
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:15,042
We done what we could.

728
01:18:16,509 --> 01:18:18,675
Step away from him, Councilor.

729
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:20,509
It happened to Bernard,
it happened to Minnie.

730
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,675
You're going to
slaughter us all.

731
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:24,675
I swear I'm gonna blow your
head off if you shoot him!

732
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:25,909
You'll damn us all!

733
01:18:25,942 --> 01:18:27,542
No, he's right.

734
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:28,642
It's all right, Jane.

735
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:30,076
I'm turning.

736
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:33,776
I won't be able to stop myself
from killing.

737
01:18:35,342 --> 01:18:37,675
And when the sun
comes up soon what then?

738
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:40,308
You'll change back,
you'll be Archie again.

739
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:41,742
I have no idea.

740
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:45,742
But I have to find out.

741
01:18:45,776 --> 01:18:46,976
I realize we haven't
known each other long,

742
01:18:47,009 --> 01:18:50,909
but I'm not ready
to say goodbye.

743
01:18:50,942 --> 01:18:52,375
Nor I, Jane.

744
01:18:52,408 --> 01:18:53,408
Oh Christ.

745
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:02,675
It's happening; go!

746
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:04,475
Don't hurt him!

747
01:19:04,509 --> 01:19:05,408
Just run, Jane!

748
01:19:05,442 --> 01:19:07,009
We've gotta leave this inn.

749
01:19:21,475 --> 01:19:22,475
Damn ye lad!

750
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:24,976
Damn ye!

751
01:19:34,042 --> 01:19:36,642
Reverend, we need to leave!

752
01:19:37,909 --> 01:19:39,876
Help me move this furniture.

753
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:40,742
Quick!

754
01:20:34,642 --> 01:20:35,742
No, Archie.

755
01:20:36,609 --> 01:20:37,809
It's us.

756
01:20:37,842 --> 01:20:38,776
It's me, Jane.

757
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:42,642
I know you're in
there, somewhere.

758
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:45,375
Fight it, Archie.

759
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:47,842
Remember who you are.

760
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:51,308
That's right, Archie.

761
01:20:51,342 --> 01:20:51,942
It's me.

762
01:21:01,876 --> 01:21:04,642
Spirit of Jesus come upon us!

763
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:08,809
Fill us with holy anger!

764
01:21:08,842 --> 01:21:12,842
Wrench us from all desires
that breed violence!

765
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:17,809
Compel us with the
fury of your love!

766
01:21:18,976 --> 01:21:21,475
O Lamb of God, grant us peace!

767
01:22:09,976 --> 01:22:10,809
Jane.

768
01:22:38,842 --> 01:22:40,509
Promise you'll
write to me, lad,

769
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:42,909
let me know how the two of
you are getting on, will you>

770
01:22:42,942 --> 01:22:44,042
The three of us.

771
01:22:44,076 --> 01:22:45,709
Of course we will.

772
01:22:45,742 --> 01:22:48,609
Anything you want,
just ask old Horrace.

773
01:22:48,642 --> 01:22:50,009
And on the next blood moon-

774
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:51,976
- You'll lock me
in the county jail.

775
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,475
Just for the night, lad.

776
01:22:53,509 --> 01:22:55,942
That should give those
scallywags a bit of a fright.

777
01:22:58,675 --> 01:23:03,542
Oh, and before I forget,
the witness reports

778
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:05,876
and warrant for your arrest.

779
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:13,442
No hard feelings.

780
