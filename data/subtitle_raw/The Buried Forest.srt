THE BURlED FOREST
(Umoregi)

4
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,947
"Won't you dance with me?"

5
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,182
That's what I asked you,

6
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,793
First we danced apart,

7
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:10,101
Then we started crying,

8
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,705
Our bodies and faces drew closer,

9
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,102
And we tasted each other's tears,

10
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,112
Beats me.

11
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,515
What's so interesting?

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,119
It's only a story, just fiction.

13
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,622
But the pictures are good.

14
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,918
Mmm...

15
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:44,636
Machi, you were talking about
the pet shop...

16
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,728
That funny pet shop.

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,334
I'd hardly call it a shop.

18
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,775
Hey...

19
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,685
Shall we make a story?

20
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,379
Huh!

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,778
What?

22
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,988
With lots of fiction.

23
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,784
Story?

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,133
About the pet shop owner.

25
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,437
He got a camel.

26
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,705
A camel?

27
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,941
You can't be serious...

28
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,605
In this town?

29
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,819
And why not?

30
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,813
It's just a story.

31
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,019
Mind you, it was hard.

32
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,229
There was nowhere to walk it.

33
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,430
So...

34
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,430
he dug up the road...

35
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,728
filled it with earth...

36
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,642
and made a path for the camel.

37
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,875
After that,

38
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,979
everyone preferred the dirt road...

39
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:13,081
and they dug up all the roads
in the town.

40
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,986
Huhhh!

41
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,394
You continue, Tokie!

42
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,100
Eh...?

43
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,999
I can't!

44
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,512
Jin!

45
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,520
Jin!

46
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,180
Machi, then.

47
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,384
I'm no good.

48
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,191
Don't be so negative.

49
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,293
Do camels have eyelids?

50
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,000
I've never checked,
but I'm sure they do.

51
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:46,317
It was three years before they
closed the bus station,

52
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,113
when I took over the business.

53
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,222
I asked my dad:

54
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:59,531
"Why didn't they make a railroad?"

55
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,768
Some people thought they would.

56
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,404
That's not what I mean.

57
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,574
My granddad was from old Tokyo.

58
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,379
He was dead against a railway.

59
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,181
So he said.

60
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,086
People had a different take
on things in the past.

61
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,893
If the railway had come here...

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,497
our little market wouldn't
be here now.

63
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,905
That's true, now you mention it.

64
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,208
Akio, has the delivery gone?

65
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,710
Hey, Akio!

66
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,619
Akio!

67
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,355
That grandma from Sanda just called.

68
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,758
She wants a big bucket.

69
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,961
A bucket?

70
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,758
Do we have one?

71
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,065
Oh, I'll look for one.

72
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,276
Ouch...

73
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,506
Hey, Tahbo!

74
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,747
Stop that!

75
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,362
Ah, here's San-chan.

76
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,278
Yo!

77
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,275
What's up, Machi?

78
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,279
What is it with your hair?

79
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,324
Thanks for the CD.

80
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,592
It was okay.

81
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,222
You like vocals, right, San-chan?

82
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,624
I suppose.

83
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,401
Summer vacation already?

84
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,504
Yep.

85
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,705
Would you like a lift?

86
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,971
No thanks.
- You don't.

87
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,539
Ride Tomo's motorbike?

88
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,143
I'll walk.

89
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,444
I like walking.

90
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,456
Good for you.

91
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,852
Be careful.

92
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,172
What are you doing?

93
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,976
Sailing a boat.

94
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,579
What kind of boat?

95
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,748
A bamboo leaf boat.

96
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,886
It's tiny, isn't it?

97
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:54,692
But it's carrying very
important things.

98
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:55,990
Yeah?

99
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:57,986
Yuko, how come Machi is
so moody these days?

100
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,196
It's probably her age.

101
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,906
Were you like that, when you
were 15 or 16?

102
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,508
Maybe I was.

103
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,608
Scary!

104
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,416
I bet you were awful!

105
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,817
I happened to be very cute.

106
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,024
Oh, yeah?

107
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,528
I feel sorry for you.

108
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,629
You never knew me when I was cute.

109
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,537
Really?

110
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,644
Say...

111
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,748
Is it true that Marui the joiner quit?

112
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,122
He has so much skill.

113
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,888
And now he's driving a taxi.

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,194
A taxi?

115
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,591
Yeah.

116
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,100
Marui is a cab driver?

117
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,209
Why a cab driver?

118
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,413
He couldn't bear working alone,
they say.

119
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:33,417
Maybe he brooded too much
over his daughter's death.

120
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,726
What a waste.

121
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,931
How will he live?

122
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,239
That's a bit callous.

123
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,590
Yes...

124
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,588
What?

125
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,888
A vehicle?

126
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,490
Yes, a story is a vehicle,

127
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,303
We get on and ride, and that's
our life,

128
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,005
I wonder.

129
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:30,305
Do you think we can choose
our vehicle?

130
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,512
Well,,,

131
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,214
A story is only words,,,

132
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,615
I'll call you.

133
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,919
See you,

134
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,206
That was the news, and now
it's back to the music,

135
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,711
This song is "Morning HaZe",

136
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,315
Hang on!
Take this miso to go with it.

137
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,619
You shouldn't...
- Here.

138
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,121
Thank you.

139
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,524
Take care.

140
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,567
Where's the fishmonger?

141
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,975
At the hospital, his wife's rheumatism
is playing up,

142
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,586
What's this?

143
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:29,798
It's the egg... of the "Elephant
Bird"... so I'm told.

144
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:37,141
They can pick up an elephant
and fly off.

145
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,010
They're massive, or so it says
in the letter.

146
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,118
So he sent this, did he?

147
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:57,319
I love Jugem's jokes like this.

148
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,870
He's never changed.

149
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,172
All the way from Brazil.

150
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,374
Do you think it's a fake?

151
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,475
You never know.

152
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,786
They say they shoot butterflies
with pistols in Brazil.

153
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:34,188
I've never met granddad
so I don't know.

154
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,801
In the fields...

155
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,596
there was a man who was
watching the sunset...

156
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,710
he suddenly got the urge
to follow the sun.

157
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,405
So he dropped the plow...

158
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,408
and walked off, never to return.

159
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,858
Maybe Jugem is like that.

160
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,792
Ah! It still works.

161
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,803
Don't want people to think
we're breaking in.

162
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,003
It's bigger than I thought.
- Certainly is.

163
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,841
It's been 5 years since he closed.

164
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,352
Amazing.

165
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,860
What photo is it?

166
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,366
Don't know.

167
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,036
I wonder where it is.

168
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,285
They're relatives, but I was
scared of my uncle.

169
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,553
So I don't really know.

170
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,145
Uncle!

171
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,152
Take our picture!

172
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,255
Who are you talking to?
- The dead!

173
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,758
Move that pram and bring a chair.

174
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,757
Be a good girl.

175
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,471
Sit down.

176
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,578
Wimp!

177
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,493
You're really pretty.

178
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,997
It's bright.

179
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,645
I like portrait photos.

180
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,142
Everyone looking in the same direction.

181
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,752
It's not often that happens.

182
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,656
I hate photos.

183
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,563
I always shut my eyes.

184
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,871
I wonder why.

185
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,466
It's a talent.
- What do you mean?

186
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:47,082
The instant the shutter opens
you wave goodbye...

187
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,481
with your eyelids, I mean.

188
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,581
That's a talent.

189
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,586
That's a compliment?

190
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,694
Yes, it is.

191
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,935
Tomo!

192
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,738
What?
- Leave the ball there.

193
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,136
Huh!

194
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,800
What are you doing?

195
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,604
Bet you can't guess.

196
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,987
There, it's the last one.

197
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,198
Come here, Tomo!

198
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,510
Quick!

199
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,928
Very interesting.

200
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,340
It means "dream" in Tonpa characters.

201
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,273
Tonpa?

202
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:08,278
Used by a small tribe in China.

203
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,684
Uh...

204
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,012
When I was little...

205
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,917
I was very shy.

206
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,520
I used to like hiding
in small spaces.

207
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,927
Once...

208
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,562
I hid in the hydrangea bush.

209
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,466
It started to rain...

210
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,771
and my parents looked for me.

211
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,377
But I didn't come out.

212
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,785
So, the camel became very
popular in town.

213
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:34,389
Lots of people came to walk
with him.

214
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,901
The camel was kind and took to
the people well.

215
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,798
They went for many walks everyday.

216
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,310
San-chan often rode the camel.

217
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,011
Called himself "Lawrence of Arabia".

218
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:59,018
And paraded around the town
2 or 3 times a day.

219
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,156
Why is San-chan in the story?

220
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,356
Never mind.

221
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,054
But...

222
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,366
But?

223
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,973
You've made me forget with
your interruptions.

224
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,773
Sorry.

225
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,778
But...

226
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:29,081
the camel started getting
depressed.

227
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:39,993
He missed so much of the simple
life of sand and sky.

228
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,791
Good one!

229
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:52,809
Tomie, please go back inside!

230
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,809
I want everyone to know
what's going on.

231
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,949
Fetch them some tea instead of
dithering about there.

232
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:06,854
What's up here?
- Oh, hello. What a fuss, eh?

233
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:11,961
Maybe you're making matters worse,
acting like this.

234
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:19,060
I know I'm sometimes in the wrong, too.

235
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,364
But the way they did it isn't fair.

236
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,365
That's the issue.

237
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,269
Marui.

238
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,371
There was a family meeting.

239
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:35,583
It was decided, and I can't
go against it.

240
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,878
You could discuss it again.

241
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,479
How?

242
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:45,093
My daughter and the family already
trooped back to Tokyo.

243
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:52,903
My son said:
"Show of hands or secret ballot?"

244
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:58,003
Now I'm being put in an "old home".

245
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,842
What was the vote?

246
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:17,554
Eight to one for packing me off,
the "one" being me.

247
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,563
I see...

248
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,563
Ah... I'm sorry for the fuss my
mother is causing.

249
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,467
That's okay.

250
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,871
Okay! Now everyone!

251
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,376
Move away from the area.
Cars are passing.

252
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,197
Watch out!

253
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,391
There's a car coming through!

254
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,831
Step back!

255
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,129
This way!

256
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,136
Sorry for dragging you out
- I don't mind.

257
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,441
It's the old woman next door.

258
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,958
I was born way in the mountains.

259
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:33,170
My mother lived there till
the day she died.

260
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,666
How old was she?

261
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,467
Ninety.

262
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,676
She was alone for 20 years
after Daddy died.

263
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:53,480
I felt sorry for her.

264
00:29:55,093 --> 00:30:00,690
But she loved the mountains.

265
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,895
She never complained.

266
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:11,702
"What if you get ill up here?"
I used to say.

267
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:19,416
"l couldn't be happier if my
time comes here."

268
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,018
That's what she said.

269
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:32,822
I was... still young.

270
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:40,837
I couldn't... understand.

271
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:08,289
How did I ever become such
a weak person?

272
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:19,209
I feel I can't live if I don't cling
to my son and everyone.

273
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,907
But Tomie-san...

274
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:33,218
you need help sometimes,
what with your legs...

275
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,121
Never mind that.

276
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:41,731
It's something to do
with myself.

277
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,782
Tomie-san.

278
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,786
We're making up a kind of story.

279
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,587
Each of us takes turns.

280
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,693
It's my turn next.

281
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,701
Will you listen?

282
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:38,916
The camel came from a place
where dunes lead to the sea.

283
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:52,425
Once, a whale washed up and couldn't
get back in the water.

284
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,938
The villagers tried dragging it
with boats.

285
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,383
They dug trenches to make
a path to the ocean.

286
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:14,786
They tried hard, but couldn't
rescue the whale.

287
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,089
The whale became weaker
and weaker.

288
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:27,201
By evening, the villagers had
given up.

289
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:41,218
But one little girl didn't leave.

290
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:57,123
She stayed and bathed the whale's
eyes with sea water.

291
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,471
Then it was morning.

292
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,259
Some fine specimens here.

293
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,357
They're called gurnards.

294
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:15,636
With those snouts they
look like dogs!

295
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,983
They're a spring fish.

296
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:27,290
They live quite deep, but sometimes
get dragged up.

297
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,594
It's the day of the altar gods.

298
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,298
So it is.

299
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:49,112
Used to be a toss up between the
altar gods and the market...

300
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,009
as to which would disappear.

301
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,682
After all...

302
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,687
they are both still here.

303
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,488
There were more kids when
I was younger.

304
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:37,290
We divided what we made, but it
never came to much.

305
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,397
My dad would pass us a few times
to boost our income!

306
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,997
When did we start calling it
"traffic tax"?

307
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,502
I wonder, too.

308
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:52,200
It's like a border crossing.

309
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,608
The kids have their own country.

310
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,114
They could form a republic!

311
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:07,147
Not a bad idea. I would be for it.

312
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,158
Oh!

313
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,764
Good job!

314
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,863
Here, It's not much,
but this is for you.

315
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,164
Thanks, mister.

316
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,998
You can make an offering with this.

317
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,304
Hey! Give some to the gods first!

318
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,945
I'm sorry.
- Okay, keep it up.

319
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,342
Here comes a car!

320
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,360
Hey!
What's all this?

321
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,163
It's altar gods day.

322
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:32,170
The day when the children clean
the statues to ward off...

323
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:37,976
It's an old tradition, and grown ups
who pass here...

324
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,877
have to pay a traffic tax to
us as a reward.

325
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,182
It's a thank you for the
kids' hard work.

326
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,886
You're kidding.

327
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,284
It's the rule.

328
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:57,097
Sounds like fun,
how much?

329
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,998
There's no rule about that.

330
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,236
Here.

331
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,435
Thanks very much!
- Thanks very much!

332
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,236
Good. See you.

333
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,757
I've lost all faith in the
older generation.

334
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,863
Instead of knocking those
balls around...

335
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,968
they should be slipping some cash
to their grandchildren.

336
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,375
True.

337
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,283
Here they are.

338
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,569
Okay, that's it!

339
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,472
Thanks for your help.

340
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,779
Think nothing of it.

341
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:12,185
It has to be turned at least
once a year.

342
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:27,498
Machi, you can't be up in
a mountain this late.

343
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,710
Are you sure you saw someone?

344
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:42,110
Hey Akio! Can you fit everybody in?

345
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,760
Were there flames near the big rock?

346
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:05,167
I think so, but it's hard
to tell at night.

347
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:11,073
The forest is a lot thicker
at night than it seems.

348
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,102
Is this the right way?

349
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,105
Hey!

350
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:46,908
Hey!

351
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,412
This way!

352
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,625
Did that come from beneath the cliff?

353
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,627
Who was it?

354
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,061
Might have been Gen.

355
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,057
Nope, here I am!

356
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,364
That's creepy!

357
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,786
Jeez!

358
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,794
You gave me such a fright!

359
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,803
That's my line, I think!

360
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,096
What the hell...

361
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,083
Here they are!

362
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,489
They're okay.

363
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,340
So much for forming a republic...

364
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:14,146
When the sun goes down,
things can happen.

365
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,659
I get tempted too, you know.

366
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,355
That's because you've got no customers.

367
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,063
Do you know this song?

368
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:30,673
As the sun goes down I start to cry.

369
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,667
I wonder why...

370
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:36,769
I wonder why I start to cry.

371
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:38,779
Do you know it?

372
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,680
Yes, I remember.

373
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,385
I do remember.

374
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:52,891
When I saw you it was love
at first sight.

375
00:48:53,497 --> 00:49:00,426
But now I am in a most
terrible plight!

376
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:08,835
As the sun goes down l
start to cry.

377
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:16,550
I wonder why I start to cry.

378
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:24,350
Please, please! Won't you love me?

379
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:33,269
Please, please! Won't you love me?

380
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,771
It must be an old song,
I don't know it.

381
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,480
Would you care for some sauce?

382
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,488
Thank you, it's wonderful.

383
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,285
Thank you.

384
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,193
It's been ages since we had dinner.

385
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,005
In fact, it's the first time.

386
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,206
No, it isn't.

387
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,603
After Kuro died...

388
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,114
Oh, that's right.

389
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,913
You brought tears to my eyes then.

390
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,620
Why?

391
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:40,527
We dug a hole near the dry river-bed
that the dog liked.

392
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,035
And you paid your last respects.

393
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:49,842
You know what you said?

394
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,245
"Thank you, Kuro."

395
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,051
Just like that.

396
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,490
I thought:

397
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,287
"Yes, thank you."

398
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,291
We should part with thanks.

399
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,398
And that's when I started crying.

400
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,805
I'm going to do it again.

401
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,527
Dogs can't talk.

402
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:49,330
He might not have known how
he helped us, me included.

403
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,284
Shall we get a new dog?

404
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,097
I don't want to.

405
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,105
I see.

406
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:32,409
But you shouldn't shut yourself off.

407
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,713
I think the same myself.

408
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,618
We should be free.

409
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:54,629
Which hot spring is Dad at tonight?

410
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,733
I didn't ask, it's just an excuse
to drink beer!

411
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,777
They don't care where they go.

412
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,376
Scoundrel!

413
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:40,104
Tahbo,

414
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,010
do you want to move house?

415
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,819
To Granddad's?

416
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,020
No.

417
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,969
To Mom's?

418
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:10,871
Nope.

419
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,683
Anywhere is okay.

420
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,789
Sorry, kiddo.

421
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,867
You know my folks are separated.

422
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,571
I never mentioned it...

423
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,272
but Mom runs a business.

424
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,669
What kind?

425
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:20,271
A bar.

426
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:25,485
I don't like coming back here.

427
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,491
Is it nearby, her bar?

428
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,391
I don't want to talk about it.

429
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:05,558
Even when things stare me in the face,

430
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,063
I still don't understand,

431
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:27,215
I should have guessed, but only
realiZe in retrospect,

432
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:40,796
I was thoughtless, and now
you're gone,

433
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:50,401
Changing shapes and colors,
clouds are floating by,,,

434
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:59,512
bathed in rays of sunlight,

435
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:07,546
The one who kept me safe,,,

436
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,256
was you,

437
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,892
It's got fuck all to do with me!

438
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,537
Don't you raise your voice to me!

439
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,842
Tomoyuki!

440
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,882
I'm sorry.

441
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,595
Should have chosen a different town.

442
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,496
You don't need to worry.

443
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:27,509
I know a really cool place near here.

444
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,403
Do you want to go?

445
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,506
Yeah.

446
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,389
Excellent!

447
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:23,988
What about cars?

448
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,093
They've stopped construction
so it's okay.

449
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,103
No people either.

450
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,222
Very good!

451
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,173
Let me try!

452
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,502
Isn't it a bit big?

453
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:42,009
It said 3 meters, so it's right.

454
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:48,916
They still existed up until
400 years ago.

455
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,416
Do the feet look okay?

456
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,509
Huh?

457
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,757
Thank you.

458
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,560
Good, eh?
I've knocked a bit off the price.

459
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,067
This the stuff?

460
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:13,567
Yes, please.

461
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:19,375
Calling it "Home Delivery Service"
is glorifying it a bit.

462
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:25,284
Akio started calling it that
in the first place!

463
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,680
How is it going?

464
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:33,387
I mean Akio's water distillation idea.

465
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,091
It's ready.

466
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:43,904
Thank you very much.

467
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,997
I'm not sure.

468
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,002
I don't really understand it.

469
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:51,803
Let's say you drink a cup of water.

470
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:59,514
How long does it take to flow
around the body?

471
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,154
Hmm... Iet's think.

472
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,356
An hour?

473
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,359
No!

474
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:09,758
Thirty minutes.

475
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,662
One minute.

476
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,764
Never!

477
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:21,273
Just one minute.
Amazing stuff, water.

478
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,172
Hello.

479
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,173
Right away.

480
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:52,096
It moved!

481
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,909
Separate the ones that move.

482
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,512
I'll collect them over here later.
- Okay.

483
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,054
Here we go!

484
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,848
It's turning.

485
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,468
Mind that roller, it's cracking.

486
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:31,471
Do you think you'll be finished today?

487
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,980
Yes, leave it to me.

488
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,282
Oh...

489
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,395
Watch your step.

490
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:11,752
How far are they moving it, Takako?

491
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,150
Ten meters, I heard.

492
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:19,559
It was slightly in the way
of the new road.

493
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:25,760
Yours is the room in the
corner, right?

494
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,670
It's odd.

495
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:36,278
Seeing our house move like that.

496
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:46,282
I once heard the story of Mayoiga.

497
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,351
MA-YOl-GA?

498
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:55,994
What's it mean?

499
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,233
Well, I'm no scholar...

500
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,432
Maybe "lost" and "house".

501
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:13,309
It's a story from olden times.

502
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:19,451
There was a big house
in the mountains.

503
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,456
They called it MA-YOl-GA.

504
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,827
If people stumbled across it...

505
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:38,268
they could take away one red bowl.

506
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,074
After that...

507
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:50,849
that person would have
the luck with food.

508
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,081
Well, that was the story.

509
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,794
We used to call it bogwood.

510
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:21,001
People used to find lumps
of wood while plowing.

511
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:24,698
It's amazing.

512
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,199
If this is...

513
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:30,703
What did you call it?

514
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,510
A buried forest.

515
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,818
If that's what it is...

516
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:52,333
There could be lots of trees.

517
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:57,538
A whole forest could be hiding
down there.

518
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:03,768
An expert is coming down from Tokyo.

519
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,671
That probably means so.

520
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,381
Don't do that!

521
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,689
Wow! It smells of cedar!

522
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:22,495
This is a town hall announcement,

523
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,597
The 5 by 8 meter object,,,

524
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:35,410
found in the croquet pitch,,,

525
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:41,010
is believed to be part
of a buried forest,

526
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:45,518
Although more details should be available
upon further investigation,,,

527
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,716
Shall we continue the story?

528
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,725
Don't know.

529
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:58,025
That forest is probably about
3,800 years old,

530
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:05,169
It is one of the greatest
discoveries in history,

531
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,473
Do you remember who this is?

532
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,371
Mr. Marui, the joiner.

533
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,588
He's here to tell you about
trees and wood.

534
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,583
Well...
Please go ahead.

535
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,295
Hello everyone.

536
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,507
Hello.

537
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:46,807
How was your summer?

538
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:58,817
My daughter and your friend Akemi
died from illness.

539
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:04,261
Since last summer I stopped working.

540
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:10,164
But now you are studying
about the buried forest.

541
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:14,272
And after I saw it, too...

542
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:20,078
I wanted to work with wood again.

543
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,875
So I've started afresh.

544
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:37,899
If Akemi was still alive,
I might not be here now.

545
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:42,198
Here's what I think.

546
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:50,508
Wood is a living thing.

547
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:55,806
For us joiners, wood is our work.

548
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,710
That's why we say "woodwork".

549
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:06,854
But the wood we use
is still breathing.

550
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:13,866
Even 3,800-year-old wood
is still breathing...

551
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:35,982
This way...

552
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,389
Stop, stop!

553
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,888
Here it is.
- Good.

554
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,598
Hey... perfect!

555
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:22,655
San-chan,

556
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:26,065
Why do you always want a horse?

557
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,562
It's too difficult.

558
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,969
So what? I like horses!

559
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:36,977
Here, fix this to the exhaust pipe!

560
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,170
Hurry up!
- Yes sir!

561
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:44,678
But, carbon dioxide is heavier
than air, it won't float.

562
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:46,276
Huh?

563
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,280
He means the exhaust gas.

564
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:53,083
Hey! Stop with the exhaust!

565
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:56,584
Have some more.

566
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,092
You can sure hold your own.

567
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:15,300
I can even drink more than my late
husband could!

568
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:20,004
He was a kind and good man.

569
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,718
It was a stroke of genius by the mayo.

570
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:41,332
Bringing the festival down into the
forest excavation.

571
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:46,336
Yes, he looks like he's daydreaming.

572
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:51,638
But he knows how to draw a crowd.

573
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:56,342
So, no "spirit lanterns" this year?

574
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:58,951
I wonder...?

575
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:04,083
The girls were making something.

576
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:09,892
I'll take a peek.

577
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,129
Watch it, Granddad!

578
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,640
Actually, I will be transferred next spring.

579
01:21:56,444 --> 01:22:00,005
Fit as a fiddle as usual, Tomie.

580
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:05,683
If I was fit
I wouldn't be in this thing.

581
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,994
Maybe she would be better
in an old people's home.

582
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:28,698
Please!

583
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:31,706
Please, try some!

584
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:33,612
Here.

585
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:38,409
This is good. Thank you.

586
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,715
Thank you.
- Thank you.

587
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,228
I can't tell the difference.

588
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:59,229
The first glass sort of sticks
in the throat, doesn't it?

589
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:05,877
But my water goes down
as smooth as silk.

590
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,573
Let me try.

591
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,395
I see!

592
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,896
What's this, then?

593
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,198
A whale!

594
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,512
More like a catfish.

595
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,011
Ah!

596
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:48,619
What a cheek!

597
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:56,224
Mr. Marui made the bamboo frame.

598
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:03,266
We covered it and painted it.

599
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:08,372
Takako, hold the tail lightly.
- Okay.

600
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,888
Okay! It's going to be fine.

601
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:36,897
Slowly.

602
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,202
Wait!

603
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:08,354
What's that?

604
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,154
The cheats!

605
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:16,960
Balloons are against the rules!

606
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:26,072
Tahbo! You ready?
- Just a bit more.

607
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,688
I'm counting on you.
Remember last year's flop?

608
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,788
This year we have to!

609
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:47,997
How can I say...
This year will be different.

610
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,196
I know what you mean.

611
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,354
It's moving!

612
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:17,561
It's moving!

613
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,481
We did it!

614
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,489
Amazing!

615
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,257
