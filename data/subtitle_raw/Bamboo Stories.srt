1
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,153
<i>I loved you with all my heart,</i>

2
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,158
<i>and still you're hurting me.</i>

3
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,960
<i>The flower chain I gave you as a gift,</i>

4
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,473
<i>to whom did you give it, my love?</i>

5
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,072
<i>Hurt me as much as you want.</i>

6
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,474
<i>I loved you with all my heart,</i>

7
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,794
<i>and still you're hurting me...</i>

8
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,354
Ready, go!

9
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,031
Hey boys!
Are you still bundling?

10
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,196
How are you?
- Fine.

11
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,158
When did you get here?
- Just now. It's boring back home.

12
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,513
Do you want to start now?
- Sure! Here we go!

13
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Push harder!

14
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,874
Done!

15
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,874
Very good!

16
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,035
Let's move the bundle!

17
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,199
Is lunch ready?
- Yes.

18
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,233
So what's for lunch?

19
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,152
It doesn't taste as good as at home.

20
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,758
I never thought I'd find you here again.

21
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,873
Yes, for seven months now.

22
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,315
Let's finish the last bundle now.

23
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,274
As fast as possible,
we have to hurry.

24
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,356
We have to leave in a few days.

25
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,597
Bring the stems to the canal.

26
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,271
Sure. I'll take these too.

27
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,957
So much bamboo makes my heart beat faster.

28
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,630
Yeah, I feel the same.

29
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,480
Get more workers.
Or you won't get the job done.

30
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,559
Sure, I will.
- OK, do it fast!

31
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,036
Salaam alaikum!
- Alaikum salaam!

32
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,159
Come on, hurry up!

33
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,393
This is good stuff!

34
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,436
One, two,

35
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,196
three, four,

36
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,432
five, six,

37
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,874
seven, eight.

38
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,913
Length is important.

39
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
Do you understand? Length is important.

40
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,158
Hey Moinar!
- Yes?

41
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,193
The length isn't right!

42
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,194
You cut the stems too short.

43
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,598
They're half a cubit short.

44
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,671
They must be 15 cubits long.

45
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,876
You're cutting them at 14.

46
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Shit...
- Pull! Yes, pull!

47
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,996
It should look nice!
- But it has to hold as well!

48
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,272
Otherwise it could break up.
- Pull!

49
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,920
Hussein, push the raft!
We'll start the engine.

50
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,200
We should follow your raft?
But you anchor in the middle of nowhere!

51
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,949
It's quieter there.
- Where do you anchor tonight?

52
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
No idea.

53
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:56,439
But not in Marguli!
Or we'll be ambushed by pirates.

54
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,830
Folks, is that an engine or is that junk?
You better toss it overboard now!

55
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,794
Heave-ho!

56
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,276
Well, here we go!
- The engine heard what I said.

57
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,713
Don't stop in every port.
Our first stop is Paharpur.

58
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,550
Straight to Paharpur?
- Yes, that's the first port.

59
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,157
Head on! We only have 13 days
to make the 300 km to Boidder Bazar!

60
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,038
Are you adding the beans now?
- No, later.

61
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,396
The potatoes aren't done yet.

62
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,352
Cut the coriander finely.
- Yes.

63
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,589
What kind of fish is it?
- Dhonia.

64
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,912
We can't just go without working.
- Just sit around at home is bad.

65
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,114
Right!
- That makes me sick.

66
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,714
Also as a young man.

67
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,471
I have never been unemployed in my life.

68
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,192
I started out on the raft as a cook.

69
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,430
I was eight at the time
and used to walk around naked.

70
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,754
An uncle brought me onto the raft.

71
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,150
My salary was 25 takas a month.

72
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,196
I supported my family with that money.

73
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,872
It went on like this for many years.
I always came back to the raft.

74
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,077
Then my father decided
I should come home.

75
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,632
Back then,
nobody stood against their parents.

76
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
My siblings were growing up.

77
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,071
My father said
I shouldn't work so far away.

78
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,674
I should stay at home.
Actually, he wanted to marry me off.

79
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,471
I was just 18 years old.

80
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,757
I was supposed to get married at 18!

81
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,316
Believe it or not:
At the time I didn't know what a woman was.

82
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,272
Three days after my wedding
I ran away and got on the next raft.

83
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,919
I didn't come home for three months.

84
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,078
This is an insect repellent.

85
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,910
It protects you from leeches and mosquitoes.

86
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,034
It's made of mustard oil and tobacco powder.

87
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,795
Hey, the stems must all be the same length!

88
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,673
Do you understand?

89
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,078
Look here! Right here!

90
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,480
You have cut the stems too high.
Don't cut them too high.

91
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,349
Otherwise they can't regrow.

92
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,636
Start bundling!
- Will do!

93
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,556
Don't cut your hands.

94
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,877
Go for lunch if you want.

95
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,476
Bamboo is very useful.

96
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,040
Poor people like me can work in the forest.

97
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,676
We make our living cutting bamboo.

98
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,271
I can provide for my family with it.

99
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,834
Someone else can then buy the stem
and build a house with it.

100
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,750
Others can build a fence around their fields.

101
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,831
You can easily build a fence using bamboo.

102
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,996
It's thin and flexible.
You can transport this material easily.

103
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,875
Everyone can benefit from it.

104
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,513
I remember...

105
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,195
I was 13 years old at the time.

106
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,478
I used to bunk off school.

107
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,397
I often got into trouble with my dad.

108
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,197
He said if his salary was not enough
to cover our school fees,

109
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,951
he would ask some relatives
and friends for support:

110
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,631
"Help me finance my children's education!"

111
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,879
My dad really tried to motivate me.

112
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,720
He himself couldn't go to school.
I always fooled around with other kids.

113
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,029
So I was expelled from the school
and ruined my chances.

114
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,316
My father told my mother:

115
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,038
"This boy is going nowhere. He'd better
start working with me in the woods."

116
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,473
Boss, I'm trying to make a deal
with this retailer.

117
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,634
If he doesn't increase his offer,
I won't sell.

118
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,994
<i>Yes, break off the negotiation then.</i>

119
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,478
Alright.
I'll get back to you soon.

120
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,312
<i>Yes. Set a high price.</i>

121
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,037
Sure! I started at 55 takas.

122
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,314
But he seems new to the business.
He doesn't have much money.

123
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,360
<i>Try to sell a few stems anyway.</i>
- Alright, I'll be in touch.

124
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,120
<i>At least a bundle.</i>
- OK.

125
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,997
All right, I'll try.

126
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,752
Sir! My boss says
you have to raise your bid!

127
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,551
In Dhaka we sell this type of bamboo
for 60 takas.

128
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,318
We offer them at a discount price on the way.

129
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,794
If you really want to buy,
we'll make you a good offer.

130
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,637
But not for a taka less!
- OK, name your price.

131
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,994
The very last offer is 42 takas,
just for you!

132
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,876
The boss said 45.
But I'm offering it for 42.

133
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,318
I have one request.
- Yes?

134
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,355
I'm 2000 takas short.
Could I transfer the money by phone?

135
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,916
No, we can't do that.
- But I have most of it.

136
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,036
Sorry, I can wait for the money for one hour,
but I can't give you credit.

137
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,549
Do you understand?

138
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,798
Pull us further toward the shore!

139
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,833
You just keep going with the boat!

140
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,315
Let it go!

141
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,234
Stronger wind
and we would have been done for!

142
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,437
A rope just snapped on the other raft.

143
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,113
Hey, that's enough!

144
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,480
Last monsun we rammed a dredger.
The raft broke right in the middle.

145
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,797
We had to stop.

146
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,597
It took us whole day
to tie everything together again.

147
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,271
We couldn't even have lunch on that day.

148
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,680
One can't afford to lose a single stem.
That would annoy the wholesaler.

149
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,873
So we had to take care of the stems first.

150
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,146
Each bundle hast 400 stems,
and the whole raft?

151
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,277
It's exactly...

152
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,034
...60 bundles.

153
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,074
How long did it take to build the raft?

154
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,996
There were three of us the first five days.
Then two more colleagues came.

155
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,034
Altogether it took us 13 days.

156
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,435
That was the bundling.

157
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,952
I had to relieve myself,
but I just couldn't.

158
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,314
Really? I'm so sorry.
We had to save the raft first.

159
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,958
There are too many people on this raft.
It disturbs me.

160
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,800
We'll build a toilet on the raft for you.

161
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,720
I'll go and order some bricks.

162
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,029
You have high standards...

163
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,116
So you use this corner as a toilet?
- The whole raft is our toilet.

164
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,950
You just have to find an opening
and let it flow.

165
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,994
Very practical!

166
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,752
Toilet, bathroom, laundry room.
All in one!

167
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,271
We also use this water for cooking.

168
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,392
We drink water from the river and pee in it.

169
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,916
So the river gets its water back.
We don't need to store any water.

170
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,157
The water is good here.
- Very good!

171
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,796
Flowing water is always good.
- Of course!

172
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,794
Salaam boss!

173
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,711
I'm where the workers are cutting the bamboo.

174
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,834
There's an elephant nearby.
We don't know if he's on heat.

175
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,670
If he comes any closer,
my workers will flee.

176
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,639
The elephant is over there.

177
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,631
He breaks the bamboo saplings and eats them.

178
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
The elephant guide isn't here yet.

179
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,159
Damned beast,
why can't you just leave us alone?

180
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,396
Come on!
Move your butt!

181
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,393
What is the foreman doing?
- Liakot is trying to provoke it.

182
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,358
He wants to find out
if the elephant is on heat.

183
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,274
If it is, it'll attack.
If not, it'll escape.

184
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,114
Shaheen, run! Run now!

185
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,994
Here it comes!

186
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,959
Did you see it? Is it on heat?
- I couldn't recognise that.

187
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,597
I was really scared!

188
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,113
Damned leeches!

189
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,399
Make sure it doesn't crush my bamboo!

190
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,750
Do the elephants come here often?
- Yes, very often.

191
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,998
We usually call the forest tenant,
who sends the elephant guide.

192
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,078
He then scares away the beasts.

193
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,590
Damned troublemaker!
I'm coming after you now!

194
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,752
Do you really have to take
your bath right here?

195
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,914
Get lost! Go away!

196
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,553
Hey, my men are working over there!

197
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,873
Over there on the hillside.

198
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,677
I'll teach you some manners!

199
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:20,196
There are so many hazards in these woods.
We are constantly at risk.

200
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,354
Some cut their hand or feet
felling the bamboo.

201
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,872
There are even other risks.

202
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,393
For example, snakes or centipedes.

203
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,670
In such a case
I have to take care of my men.

204
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,111
Some have to go to hospital.

205
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,632
Or we go to a village
where a shaman can neutralize the poison.

206
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,436
Such things happen every day around here.

207
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,392
That's why I'm always worried about my men.

208
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,755
Does someone have a problem?
Has something happened to him?

209
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,319
Who showed up for work?
And who's missing?

210
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,116
As foreman,
I'm always worried about my guys.

211
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,398
The stem is covered with very fine hair.

212
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,435
I wipe them off so they don't get on my skin.

213
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,831
Otherwise it starts itching badly
when I carry the stems.

214
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,351
Are you done bundling?

215
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,629
Shoulder the stems now! And cut lower!
- You don't have to tell me that!

216
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,516
I'm not telling you,
- I always cut low.

217
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,793
I meant the newcomers!
Many cut the bamboo...

218
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,514
way too high.

219
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,395
The leeches are a torture.
- They're a plague.

220
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,514
Watch out, the forest tenant is here.
- Let him come!

221
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,837
He should see how we work.

222
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,311
Salaam boss!
- Alaikum salaam!

223
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,153
Do you want your bamboo now?
- No.

224
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,194
You're carrying stems, too?
- Yes, we aren't enough.

225
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,995
Where are you cutting?
- On the hillside over there.

226
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,078
Where? Where exactly?

227
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,234
On the hillside, up there.

228
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,159
Where exactly?
- Over there.

229
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,990
On the spot higher up
that we went to see last time.

230
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,195
You know what I mean?
- How many workers are there?

231
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,200
Well, there are a few already.
- How many?

232
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,670
You see, how long the stems are?
- Very good.

233
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,437
We need more workers.

234
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,038
I'll send some later.

235
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,275
I need to talk to you.

236
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,038
Is there any water?
- Let's drink some water first.

237
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,394
Is it itching?

238
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,192
Yes, all the time!

239
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,280
You're cutting all the types of bamboo,
right? Are you cutting the Zatai bamboo?

240
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,520
They are deep in the woods.
We can't reach there.

241
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,110
It's a dense patch of the forest.

242
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,674
Nonsense! You should have spotted
the Zatai bamboo and cleared a path.

243
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,791
I don't know how you work.
You always look for an easy way.

244
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,755
Salaam aleikum.

245
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,315
Salaam aleikum?

246
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,919
No, I don't know.

247
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,836
I'll have to ask in Dhaka.
If the court has reached the verdict.

248
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,712
Yes, I'll ask. Bye!

249
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,355
We sued the forestry authority.
The lease period is too short.

250
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,835
But we lost the lawsuit.
Now we have to file an appeal.

251
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,918
It's getting complicated now.

252
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,759
We live in the digital age. The forestry
authority should adjust the laws.

253
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,239
For example...
At first the lease period was 12 months.

254
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,992
We were able to cut eight million stems.
There were enough loggers then.

255
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,435
We had also day labourers.
Today, many people go abroad.

256
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,757
There are thousand jobs in construction.

257
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,954
There are so many easy jobs
like masoning, or farming.

258
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,679
Logging is hard work. After three days
of work one has to rest for four days.

259
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,715
We'll never get four million stems
in such a short time.

260
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,630
I paid millions for this bamboo.
But I cannot cut a single stem.

261
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,000
If I cut one,
I have to sleep for two days.

262
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,512
Only loggers can do that.
I depend on them.

263
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,874
God has given me a lot of money.
But not the ability to cut bamboo.

264
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,995
We're in this business for three generations.
First it was my grandfather, then my father.

265
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,990
Continuing the tradition,
I run the business now.

266
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,318
I create jobs for the poor this way.

267
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,992
Let's have a break now.

268
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,674
Did you hear what the leaseholder said?
He has to go to bed, after cutting one stem.

269
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Right.

270
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,113
Only one stem!
We have to cut 50 per day.

271
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,110
Still he won't raise our wages.
- He never does.

272
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,360
I just want to be paid properly for my work.

273
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,919
These damn jungle critters
suck all our blood.

274
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,552
If you're not paid enough,
how can you stay motivated?

275
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,840
I want to confront him.
But when I see him, I lose my courage.

276
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,797
But we depend on him.
- How much do you get for cutting a stem?

277
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,272
It's four takas (0.04 euros) per stem.

278
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,595
Even a cup of tea at the bazaar
costs three takas.

279
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,033
And a kilogram of rice is 40 to 50 takas.

280
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,915
And for much does the leaseholder
sell a bamboo?

281
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,915
How much?

282
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,718
Ask the foreman, he knows.
- How much?

283
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,630
He sells some of the stems
to the wholesaler for...

284
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,680
...20, 25, 30 takas, or more.

285
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,594
It depends.

286
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,478
It depends on the deal he makes
with the wholesaler.

287
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,280
Wholesalers pay more for good stems.

288
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,279
They pay less for the bad ones.

289
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,311
Come on, let's get back to work.
We don't have much time.

290
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,599
Let's walk right here.

291
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,470
Alaikum salaam!
How are you guys doing on the raft?

292
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,032
How is the bamboo selling?

293
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,789
Well, the retailers,
that's just how they are.

294
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,358
Let them bargain.
They have a right to it.

295
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,996
You haven't sold anything yet?

296
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,676
If retailers don't want to buy,
there's nothing we can do.

297
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,398
You don't have to bargain then.
Where is Shoheed?

298
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,555
You don't have to cosy up to anyone.
Just keep going.

299
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,194
Are these your bricks?
- Yes. Those are first choice bricks.

300
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,910
These are second choice.

301
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,150
Over there is the sand.
There are more bricks in the back.

302
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,116
Here is the gravel
and there is another type of brick.

303
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,753
So many bricks?
I thought you are a bamboo wholesaler?

304
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,119
Well, it's just a little side business
I have.

305
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,277
This is my office.

306
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,355
This is where I work with my employees.

307
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,714
Don't worry.
They'll make it alright.

308
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,674
Shiraz called.
They have to wait in a port.

309
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,239
Exactly.
- They don't want to carry on today.

310
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,799
The next port is too far away.
It's too dangerous for the raft.

311
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,391
They can't risk travelling at night.

312
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,560
Strong winds or a storm could break the raft.

313
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,919
If the river is so dangerous,
why not use a truck?

314
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,229
Well, that would be too expensive.

315
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,750
Transporting a single stem by truck
costs more than 20 takas.

316
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,312
Shipping it down the river
costs me only nine takas.

317
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,990
On the river we can transport
50,000 stems in a single raft.

318
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,318
By land, we would need 25 trucks.

319
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,759
The waterway is better for the wood too.
- Why?

320
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,670
The constant moisture
keeps the bamboo fresh.

321
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,000
You can also transport
the stems in large bundles.

322
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,591
Water keeps them protected
and it will last longer.

323
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,274
On a truck, they would dry out
and many stems would just break.

324
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,157
It's too expensive.
- Expensive and brings only disadvantages.

325
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,075
My family has been running this business
for generations.

326
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,036
I represent the fourth generation.

327
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,590
We can't give up on this business,
because it is in our flesh and blood.

328
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,875
So your son will take over one day?
- No, it's better if he doesn't.

329
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,117
It's a risky business.

330
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,511
When these children are grown up,
the bamboo business will be gone.

331
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,032
I want him to do something else.

332
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,438
He should learn another profession.

333
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,389
What a time we are living in now.

334
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,954
Disgusting.

335
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,356
Look. They're building over there again.

336
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,279
All the earth they are digging up.
- Everything with just one excavator.

337
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,399
Are they building a dam?
- No, a factory.

338
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,149
That's why they are piling up?
- Right.

339
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,469
This excavator works all the time.
Day and night.

340
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,552
They're encroaching on the river.

341
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,634
It digs and piles up soil without a break.

342
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,674
And not a single worker in sight.

343
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,120
We are the retailers,
who buy bamboo from raftsmen.

344
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,953
We then sell the stems in the market.

345
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,517
Do you like this bamboo?
- Yeah. It is good.

346
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,153
We'll now try to negotiate a price
with the wholesaler.

347
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,792
We'll call him now
and hopefully we can agree on a price.

348
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,399
Are these stems new?

349
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,190
Boss, the retailers want to negotiate.
They have seen the stems.

350
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,679
Now they want to hear a price.

351
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,554
Salaam aleikum.
<i>- Aleikum salaam.</i>

352
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,397
What do the dholai
and the shagornal bamboo cost?

353
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,872
<i>Which one do you want?</i>

354
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,077
The cheaper one. So how much?
In fact, we need both types.

355
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,192
He should just name his price!

356
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
<i>Sorry?</i>

357
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:18,390
Name the price for both types.
We'll buy the cheaper one.

358
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,632
<i>The dholai is excellent this time.</i>

359
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,080
We saw that.
Just name a price.

360
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,832
<i>You are the retailer.
You name a price.</i>

361
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,752
Brother, the stems are yours!
We cannot suggest a price.

362
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,359
<i>How many do you want to buy?</i>
- We want 3,000 stems.

363
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,433
<i>3,000 stems, all right...</i>

364
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,634
<i>For the dholai bamboo,
I want 34 takas per stem.</i>

365
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,993
How much, 34?
- Yes, 34.

366
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,958
<i>34.</i>
- Yes, 34. And for the shagornal?

367
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,560
<i>It's already late.
I don't want to negotiate too long.</i>

368
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,115
<i>I want 38 takas for the shagornal bamboo.</i>

369
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,237
You won't sell for less?

370
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,514
<i>No, take a look at the stems again.</i>

371
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,237
There are other rafts as well.
- Lower the price a bit.

372
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,035
<i>No, just look at the stems!</i>

373
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,518
We've already seen them.
- Other rafts will be here soon!

374
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,793
That's why we called you.
- The price is too high!

375
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,560
Let him bargain a bit.

376
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,279
These stems shouldn't cost more
than those we've bought already.

377
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,591
We'll offer you 25 for the dholai
and 32 for the shagornal bamboo.

378
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,956
<i>If someone sells for 25 takas,</i>

379
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,315
<i>then he must have bought the stem
for 15 takas.</i>

380
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:59,915
No idea. You are the wholesaler!
<i>- ...no, I can't do it for 25.</i>

381
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,516
Whatever deal you cut
with a forest leaseholder is your business!

382
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,918
<i>The transport alone costs ten takas.</i>

383
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,796
<i>If I sell a stem for 25,
I won't make any profit.</i>

384
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,550
<i>That would only cover the expenses.</i>

385
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,835
If you accept our offer,
we could buy even 5,000 stems.

386
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,200
<i>Nobody will sell you for this price.</i>

387
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,396
But we already bought
some stems for this price.

388
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,631
<i>Really?</i>
- Yes, absolutely.

389
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,797
Come on, brother!
Let's meet in the middle.

390
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,511
We came on your raft to buy!

391
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,272
All right, our last offer is 27 takas.

392
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,152
If you agree,
we'll buy 5,000 right away.

393
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,751
And we're not going to buy on credit.
We pay at once.

394
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,001
<i>No, you've to offer more!</i>

395
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:57,957
No, sir! We've already
offered two more takas!

396
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,800
Come on, let's go!
- Two takas!

397
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,319
If you agree, call us back.
- OK, boss. We'll talk again later.

398
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,555
I'll call you after the evening-prayer.

399
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,752
<i>All right.</i>

400
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,275
Would you like to eat something? No?

401
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,597
We've eaten already.

402
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,879
We've eaten at home.
- Aha, you've eaten already.

403
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,637
I have two daughters and a son.

404
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,951
My daughter was born first,
then my son and now the little girl.

405
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,636
Because of a family feud,
I wasn't able

406
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,795
to build a house on my own property.

407
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,438
So I came here and asked my in-laws for help.

408
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,749
They allowed me to build the house
on this property.

409
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,035
They also provided their trees
for the construction.

410
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,031
That's how I built this house all by myself.

411
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,280
We lived with the in-laws back then.

412
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,279
But work in this house never ends.
I have to refurbish these walls soon.

413
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,875
I'll ask the forest leaseholder
to give me some bamboo.

414
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,393
I will refurbish the walls,
if I get some stems.

415
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,391
The wall is breaking down
on this side as well.

416
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,878
She is your mother-in-law?
- Yes.

417
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,640
Where is your wife?

418
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,873
She's busy in the kitchen.

419
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,076
She doesn't want to come out?
- Well, she's a bit shy. She doesn't want to.

420
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,151
What would you like your children
to become once they grow up?

421
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,038
Well, they're not grown up yet,

422
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,791
so I can't really say.

423
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,960
Should your son become a logger too?
- No, no.

424
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,991
I had no other choice.
But not him, no.

425
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,639
I want him to become a teacher
or to pick a similar profession.

426
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,870
I hope he would get a decent job.

427
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,278
The girls will leave eventually.

428
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,120
I can't hold on to them.

429
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,312
They'll be married off one day.

430
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,039
I work hard to save money

431
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,358
so I can marry off my daughters.

432
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,232
That's why I work especially hard.

433
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Hello.

434
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
Hello.

435
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,314
My sweetheart!

436
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,080
<i>Hi daddy.</i>

437
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,920
How are you doing?
<i>- Fine!</i>

438
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,354
Have you had breakfast?
<i>- No.</i>

439
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,518
Aren't you hungry?

440
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,759
It's 9 a.m. already.
When do you want to eat?

441
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,396
You should have eaten earlier.

442
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,673
<i>Listen, I went to the doctor with the boy.</i>

443
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,200
<i>He has nightmares
and he often yells in his sleep.</i>

444
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,919
<i>He gets scared of something
while he's sleeping.</i>

445
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,640
Now, who is this?
- Mummy.

446
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,231
Mummy.
- Yes, that's your mum.

447
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,990
Do you know where she is now?

448
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,038
Do you want to throw the photos away?

449
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,157
You'll then have to look for them.

450
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,120
It was 7 o'clock in the morning.

451
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,677
My wife was in the kitchen,
cooking on the gas stove.

452
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,951
She didn't notice
her dress had caught fire.

453
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,119
Please don't tear the photos!

454
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,834
It was winter.
She probably thought

455
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,160
the heat she felt
came from the gas stove.

456
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,951
So she didn't notice
how her dress had caught fire.

457
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,237
Finally, she realized
she was in mortal danger.

458
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,035
There was nobody with her.

459
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,200
Some had already left the house,
others were asleep.

460
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,439
We heard the screams
and ran to the kitchen.

461
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,192
But the door was locked
because she was about to take off her dress.

462
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,994
Later...

463
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,156
When we finally barged in,

464
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,992
about 50% of her body was covered in burns.

465
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,959
Ten days later she died in the hospital.

466
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,597
My life has been chaos ever since.

467
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,797
I just don't feel well
when I'm at home.

468
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,634
I also don't feel like working here
in the village.

469
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,276
I am often very restless.

470
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,555
I'm often sad when I'm at home.

471
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,992
My relatives told me

472
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,160
it would be better
if I left home for a few years.

473
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,070
Time heals all wounds, they said.

474
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,030
Don't let the mood at home drag you down.

475
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,551
Stay away.

476
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,434
You'd better work somewhere else
for a few years.

477
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,997
That's why the work on the raft
suits me fine.

478
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,480
I chew betel when my throat gets dry.
If I chew it, then the juice comes out.

479
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,234
Do you understand?

480
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,999
Oh! A leech has crept in here.

481
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,153
There it is.

482
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,031
Haven't you use any repellent?
- I have, but not on the upper body.

483
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,311
It just snuck in here.
I noticed how it crawled up slowly.

484
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,716
Do you understand?

485
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,879
I felt it on my skin.

486
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,799
They suck you dry
whenever they can.

487
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,958
I moved from forest to forest
with my father for many years.

488
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,996
When I grew up,
and he became very old,

489
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,636
he was about to die,
and wanted a daughter-in-law.

490
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,755
The family just made a decision.

491
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,394
I did not agree at all

492
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,880
and ran away from home
to avoid marriage.

493
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,880
But they looked for me
and finally caught me.

494
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,393
They found me at the bazaar.

495
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,917
I was hiding there.

496
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,315
My father stood before me
with tears in his eyes.

497
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,195
So I gave in.

498
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,720
But I was lucky with my wife.
She even has a high school degree.

499
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:03,634
I can just write my name,
nothing else.

500
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,080
I can only sign my name.

501
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,390
But my wife attended school
until eighth grade.

502
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,234
My wife.

503
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,275
Even as a person, she is someone special.

504
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,871
Three years after our wedding,
she gave me a daughter.

505
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,919
You should eat.
I don't want you to run away.

506
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,513
Maybe I'll still run away.
- The food tastes good!

507
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,271
The cook must stay here until the end.

508
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,034
Shiraz, take more fish.

509
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,630
Doesn't Hussein want it?
- No.

510
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,956
You're having problems with the tide, right?
- Yes, exactly.

511
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,996
We could have continued with low tide,

512
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,032
but can't take advantage
of the tide at night, only in the morning.

513
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,757
We don't travel at night.
It's just too dangerous.

514
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,237
Why is it dangerous?

515
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,839
Because the river pirates are waiting for us.

516
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:37,312
We have nothing,
but they still target us.

517
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,713
Revenues are sent by phone.
- Why do they attack you then?

518
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,033
The pirates know we don't have much.

519
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,872
But all of us have our cell phones.

520
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,278
Four cell phones will get you
some quick cash.

521
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,110
200 per cell phone, that's 800.
They would be happy with that.

522
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,837
They're third-class pirates.
- Poor bastards like us.

523
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,875
They'll even take old clothes and shoes.

524
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,192
It's like in a bad movie.

525
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:16,316
Nobody would say who they are
although everyone knows them.

526
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,231
Their people collect protection money
even in broad daylight.

527
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,477
The police are in cahoots with them.

528
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,355
They screw us and the pirates too.

529
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,393
Both just rob us blind.

530
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,596
That's just how it is in this country.
What can you do?

531
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,234
Please give me a cigarette!

532
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,197
I need a cigarette.

533
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,840
Did you read the warning label
on the cigarette box?

534
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,156
You see,
what happens if you keep smoking?

535
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,799
"Smoking causes heart disease".
Stop smoking, or it's gonna kill you.

536
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,999
You won't survive a heart disease.
How many did you have this week?

537
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,351
Oh, leave him.
- Three packs so far.

538
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,031
Have you seen
how this poor bastard is dying?

539
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,791
With an oxygen mask.
- Do you know why I smoke?

540
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,878
Why?
- I'm worried about my family.

541
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,470
And smoking makes you worry less?

542
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,549
Better send home the money you smoke.
- Poverty never ends.

543
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,878
How should it end if you spend 150 takas
every week on smoking?

544
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,040
Send the money to your family.
They need it.

545
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,757
I cannot think if I don't smoke.
- Nonsense!

546
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,636
Your brain has already dried up
from smoking.

547
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,833
Stop smoking.

548
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,473
Or you'll die like this guy.
- An oxygen-mask won't help then.

549
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,274
You won't be able to breath.

550
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,075
Can you hear how he's coughing?

551
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,590
You will cough like that soon.
Look how he's wrapped himself up?

552
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,114
If you don't smoke,
you won't feel cold either.

553
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,030
You can walk around in a T-shirt like I do.

554
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,193
Stop smoking.

555
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,835
Hello.

556
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,034
It would be better
if we talked directly to each other...

557
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,711
I'll call you back.
I see some visitors on my raft.

558
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,071
<i>All right.</i>
- Talk to you later.

559
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,914
Gentlemen!
We don't have any money today!

560
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,318
It's not about money. Come here!
- Sorry?

561
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,759
They are our guests...

562
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,396
What do the police want?

563
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,879
This river police always collects money
from us.

564
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,637
They want bribes?
- Yes.

565
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,320
Do you always have to pay up?
- Yes, always.

566
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,597
But since they've seen you
they just want to talk.

567
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,032
They want to know
who you're and what you're doing.

568
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,516
What happens if you don't pay?
- They would threat to beat us up.

569
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,350
Another group will show up soon to collect
protection money, because of pirates.

570
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,876
It's a work for bums.

571
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,916
I bought an electric rickshaw last year.

572
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,599
For 70,000 takas.

573
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,713
I rode it for eight months.
But I didn't like it.

574
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,037
I sold the rickshaw for 25,000 takas.

575
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:24,070
Then I went back on the raft again.
I just don't like being self-employed.

576
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,389
Since then, I work on the raft
whenever I can.

577
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,831
Why do you like this job?

578
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,753
Here I can work half a day
and have the rest of the day off.

579
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,394
That's all.

580
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,515
We once bought him a rickshaw.
He did not like that.

581
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,431
We financed his taxi license.
But he did not like that either.

582
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,715
He also quit a job in a restaurant.

583
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,750
How did Shiraz's father earn his living?

584
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,033
He was also a rafter.

585
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,476
You have three children.
- Yes.

586
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,631
It must be very difficult for you
to be on your own?

587
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,469
Yes, it is difficult.
But my family supports me.

588
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,472
Your father supports you?

589
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,957
He is dead.
But my mother and my brothers help me.

590
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,113
Shiraz doesn't have any education.
He can't even write his own name.

591
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,031
How often have I tried to teach him to write.
One should be able to do this.

592
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,676
But he prefers to use his fingerprint.

593
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,432
You tried to teach him?
- Naturally.

594
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,758
You have to know how to write
at the authorities or the bank.

595
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,080
I am always ashamed
but Shiraz has no problem with it.

596
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,673
Is working as a raftsman profitable at all?

597
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,394
How could it be?

598
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,277
How much can you earn doing this job?

599
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,039
Look at the state of the house.
There is not even enough money for food.

600
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,678
How would he renovate the house?
Soon it will fall apart.

601
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,079
He's just able to provide
the family's basic needs.

602
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,995
But you did know Shiraz well earlier.
- No, we didn't know him that well.

603
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,397
He lived far away.

604
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,759
If we had known him better, we would have
never married off our daughter to him.

605
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,558
When he comes home,
he stays a week at the most.

606
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,720
He can't stay longer.
There wouldn't be enough food for everyone.

607
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,919
So he has to go back on the raft.

608
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,950
How do they work in the cold?

609
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:21,917
At home we can't keep ourselves warm
with even two blankets.

610
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,233
How do they sleep under the open sky?

611
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,398
Shit, that's slippery.
- What do you mean?

612
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,079
Everything is dry here.

613
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,913
Are you hungry?

614
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,839
Say something.
- I'm very hungry.

615
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,792
Well, I didn't forbid you to eat!

616
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,800
The workers started late today.

617
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,356
They thought it would rain.

618
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,113
It took us seven to eight days...

619
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,319
...just working on this reservoir
until it was ready.

620
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,191
Many day labourers worked on it.

621
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,231
About 20 to 25 people all together.

622
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,110
Every single day.

623
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,480
We built this dam right here,
which reaches to down there.

624
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:11,390
We had to pile up all the mud.
There is a certain technique to build it.

625
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,637
This is the dam wall.

626
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,712
The scaffold gives the necessary hold,
when we pour mud in this opening.

627
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,880
The construction will become very solid.

628
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,392
The wall must be secured down there.

629
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,555
Stems are lying chaotic here.

630
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,313
The work of a whole week floating.

631
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,953
That's just how it is.

632
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,313
Our fathers created
most of the reservoirs up here.

633
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,719
When I was little
I came here with my father.

634
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,072
The forest tenant at the time
was the father of Mamun.

635
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,796
If we dam up the water over there

636
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,109
20 loggers can float
hundreds of bundles right here.

637
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,433
It would be very easy.

638
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,114
Without the reservoir,

639
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,794
we could only float maximum five bundles.

640
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,035
When we open the gate, water-flow brings
the stems down to the valley.

641
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,919
There are a dozen of reservoirs like this.

642
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,876
Next week, we'll open all the gates
and float the stems down the canal.

643
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,631
Hey Mithun, take some of mine.
- I'm fine, thanks.

644
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,594
Come on, take some.
- No, eat yourself.

645
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,034
Please, I have way too much.

646
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,193
Help me out!

647
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,157
We shouldn't waste our food.

648
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:45,079
My wife fried rice and potatoes.
This way the food won't spoil.

649
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,994
What is he drinking?
- Water from the reservoir.

650
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,078
What, from this reservoir?
- Yes.

651
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,556
My goodness.

652
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,991
What else should I drink?
- I won't drink that.

653
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,240
This water is very good!
- I won't drink it either.

654
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,137
You ate so much rice.
Won't you drink anything?

655
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:06,138
No, I'm good.

656
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,915
Dad, what's this?
- What?

657
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,554
What is it?
- This is bamboo.

658
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,151
What?
- Bamboo!

659
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,956
I'll fix the wall with this bamboo.
The leaseholder didn't give me any.

660
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,916
Of course, he gets annoyed
when people take it for free.

661
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,955
The leaseholder pays millions for bamboo.

662
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,995
Of course, he gets annoyed
when people take it for free.

663
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,240
If I get caught, he would say:

664
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,558
"You're just helping yourself
from my lease."

665
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,192
It would be very shameful for me.

666
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,315
That's why I do this very rarely.

667
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,552
Only in case of emergency
I steal some stems.

668
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,549
From time to time I just need one or two.

669
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:30,437
I have a lot to fix in my house.
Everything is broken.

670
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,674
When it rains,
water runs down from the roof

671
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,591
and splashes against this wall.

672
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:47,238
The wall gets wet, the mud dissolves
and the bamboo scaffolding is damaged.

673
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,717
Then the wall will be ruined.

674
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,873
We have to repair it every year.

675
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,114
You know what I mean?

676
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,232
I built all of this with my own hands.

677
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:08,879
I cannot afford craftsmen.
They are too expensive. That's the way it is.

678
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,719
The problem is,
we have to buy all our groceries.

679
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,037
Food is expensive.

680
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,874
That's why my husband must work so hard
to earn enough money.

681
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,960
If there's no job in the forest,
I work as a craftsman.

682
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:32,871
My neighbours ask me often to fix something.

683
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,720
I earn 300 to 400 takas a day.

684
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,913
Everyone pays what they can.

685
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,079
I keep a few chickens and ducks,

686
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,876
to earn something as well.

687
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,517
So that I can cover the school fees
and support my husband.

688
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,955
I am tired.
I need to lie down.

689
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,396
Did you go to school today?
- No, I helped mother cook.

690
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:16,278
Why?
Oh right, she cut her finger yesterday.

691
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,438
Exactly.
- All right.

692
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,558
Did you at least go to school?

693
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:29,116
Hey, wait a second. What did you do?
- He took care of the goat.

694
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,198
You took care of the goat?

695
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,639
That's no way to earn money.

696
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,954
I spoiled my chances for an education.

697
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,915
You don't need to follow me.

698
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,197
Should your children take over the business?
- No.

699
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,070
I can't imagine that.

700
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,354
Put it away.

701
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,111
It's a complicated business.

702
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:31,599
My children shouldn't get involved.

703
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,873
They should study
and go into the civil service.

704
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,840
A worry-free job.

705
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,156
Do you have a lot of worries?
- Yes, I have many worries.

706
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,072
But people say you don't lack anything.

707
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,040
People only see the surface.
They don't know what is underneath.

708
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,756
My lease area is in the mountains.
But the residential areas are flooded.

709
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:19,876
Communication is bad.
The workers can't leave their families alone.

710
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,517
They are already starving,
but they can't leave.

711
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,079
Their houses are flooded.
The roads are cut off.

712
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,640
This year, I'm going to lose a lot of money.

713
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,356
The workers won't understand this.
We cut 50,000 stems this week.

714
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,760
The workers would say it was 200,000.
They only see a canal full of stems.

715
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,629
Bamboo is wood for poor people, you know?

716
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,676
Rich people no longer buy bamboo.
It's only of use to poor people.

717
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:57,679
The problem is the high price of the rice.
It makes life difficult for the workers.

718
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,833
But I can't tie my wages
to the price of the rice.

719
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,398
If I increase the wages,
my bamboo would be expensive.

720
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:11,709
Then I wouldn't make a profit.
The wholesalers wouldn't buy from me.

721
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,796
If the boss complains later,
I'll have a problem.

722
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,800
Come on!

723
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:26,999
No, I can't reduce the price
without the boss's permission.

724
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,796
Otherwise he'll consider me a thief.
- Hey, stay here!

725
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,030
Boss, the negotiations aren't going well.

726
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,633
The last retailers offered 27 takas.

727
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,079
Their phones have been off ever since
and I can't reach them.

728
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,432
Now the retailer Hassan is on the raft.

729
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,679
He's offering even less.

730
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,556
Just 26 takas.
- My offer is fair!

731
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,635
Hello, how are you doing?
Yes? I'm fine, too.

732
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,230
<i>How are you?</i>
- I'm fine, thanks.

733
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,560
Listen, the market is bad at the moment.

734
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,310
Bamboo just isn't selling at the moment.

735
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,560
<i>Yes, that's why I'm asking
for less already.</i>

736
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,552
That's right. But the time is bad now.
Otherwise I would offer more.

737
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:24,439
The last dealers offered 27,
I'm offering 26.

738
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,479
I'll buy the dholai bamboo at that price.

739
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:35,232
<i>I'm sorry, I can't sell at this price.</i>
- We won't make a deal this time then?

740
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,996
<i>Yes, I'm sorry too.</i>
- OK.

741
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:44,556
Let's leave it.
- Listen, take the stems for 27.

742
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,074
No, believe me,
no one would buy it from me at this price.

743
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,640
Brother...

744
01:13:51,641 --> 01:13:55,556
Listen,
I buy thousands of stems from you every time.

745
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:01,160
Have I ever ripped you off?
- No! We're friends, too!

746
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,554
You have your business,
I work for the wholesaler.

747
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:11,639
Of course, we have personal interests.
But our friendship is of worth as well.

748
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,277
That's right.
- We must not risk that.

749
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,469
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

750
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:58,874
This root is too deep in the ground.
I'll dig it out later with a shovel.

751
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,911
The forest is a sacred place.

752
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:35,920
You won't find
such a sacred place anywhere else.

753
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:41,437
In the canal for example,
you should only pee downstream.

754
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,155
If you pee upstream,

755
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,717
then you conjure great misfortune...

756
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,629
Certain places in these woods are haunted.

757
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,597
If you were to relieve yourself there
you would be haunted by evil spirits.

758
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:05,799
You could lose your mind over this.
It happened to many people.

759
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,757
In my time in the forest,
I've seen such people.

760
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,351
Their mind has simply stopped working.

761
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:21,115
Some couldn't even recognise
their family any more.

762
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,551
The forest just drives you crazy.

763
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,833
In my case...

764
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,791
I know this place very well.

765
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,317
I grew up in this forest.

766
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,559
It has been my home since my childhood.

767
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,716
I was in the woods
with my father all the time.

768
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,679
A whole 29 years already.

769
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,555
Are you collecting firewood?

770
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,231
Of course, we are poor people!

771
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,150
Oh girl, you're poor?
You just have to harvest the rice!

772
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,593
I wish we could! Can't you see
how the river swallows our fields?

773
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:33,229
We can't even save our houses
from the river.

774
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:37,870
The erosion forced us to move deeper
into the mainland.

775
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,593
Everything is destroyed.

776
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,677
The river is constantly eroding
the soil around here.

777
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,673
At first over there.

778
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,993
And now here.

779
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,518
People have a hard life in this area.

780
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,717
Seven times the river washed away my house.

781
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,676
I had to move seven times.

782
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,360
The river destroyed a lot in our area.

783
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,237
Seven times I had to start all over again.

784
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:34,231
Seven times.
I'll probably have to move again this year.

785
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,719
It doesn't look good
along by the riverbank at home.

786
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,840
Now I'm wondering
where I can rebuild my house.

787
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:49,873
It always takes time to settle
in a new place.

788
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,517
But this is my life.

789
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,191
Anyone who faces this
loses quite a lot of things.

790
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,151
But we have no choice.
God has left us no choice.

791
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,991
There were no incidents on this trip.

792
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,758
In the past,
we've been often raided by river pirates.

793
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,673
But this time
we were spared even in risky places.

794
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:33,109
When did you see your son last time?
- I haven't seen him for a month now.

795
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:38,191
A month is a long time.
I am looking forward to seeing him again.

796
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,393
Around this time
he'll be playing with his friends.

797
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,911
Yesterday I spoke with him for a long time.

798
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,876
He doesn't believe I'm coming back

799
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:53,360
because I've promised him so often
that I'll be back.

800
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,319
Here, take it!

801
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,478
Stow it all away.

802
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,040
Untie the string.

803
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,599
My boys are almost every month on the raft.

804
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:29,157
They've just got back.

805
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:35,471
They've been travelling
for more than a month.

806
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,993
How can they do this again
without a break?

807
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,158
It's all very well for you.

808
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,999
You can go home every day after work
and see your family.

809
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,437
Some of my men are young. They have to spend
at least a few days with their families.

810
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,797
Have you packed all your stuff?

811
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,076
Yes. Our little community is coming
to an end after a month.

812
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,840
It was even longer.

813
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,437
How are you, darling?

814
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,230
Hey? Why don't you speak?

815
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,273
Are you alright?

816
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,393
I went swimming with grandma.

817
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,230
I see.
Have you already eaten?

818
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,914
Not yet?
- I have.

819
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,953
What did you have?
- Milk.

820
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,240
Is that so?

821
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,072
Why didn't you come to the port
to pick me up from the raft?

822
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:57,397
How would I have got there?
- Well, you could have walked.

823
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,996
By foot?
- Yes.

824
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,077
Are you scared at night, sweetheart?
- Yes. He's also freezing and sweating.

825
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,671
His pillow is always dripping wet.

826
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,713
He shivers every night.

827
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,634
I don't know
why he screams in his sleep.

828
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,198
Why were you screaming?
- I dreamt of mummy.

829
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,199
What did she say?

830
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:28,077
I shoved her and she scolded me.

831
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:31,353
Really?
Well, now daddy is back.

832
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,758
What have you brought?
- Some fruit.

833
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,236
I'm on my way again.
Take care of yourself.

834
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,595
Right?

835
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,392
Don't argue with the neighbours.
My never-ending back and forth.

836
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,434
The next trip is just around the corner.

837
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,756
Don't you say anything
when he is gone so often?

838
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,473
Well, he is not going forever.

839
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,357
Do you remember the time
when you were just married?

840
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,757
Did he leave you alone often back then?

841
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,232
I can't remember.
He was always on the raft.

842
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,799
We got married very young.
I didn't know what a husband really was.

843
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,151
And you never said anything?
- No!

844
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,511
I was fine when he was gone.

845
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,992
Leave us some money.

846
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:50,511
But I'll get it next week.
- Just ask for an advance.

847
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,314
Well, let's see.

848
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:00,792
Haven't you just come home two days ago?
- Yes. Still we have to go again.

849
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,671
30,000 stems are waiting for us this time.

850
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,952
We've to bring them here.

851
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,799
Please hurry!

852
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,551
Push the bundles forward!

853
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:33,920
Thousands of stems will be floating
down the canal today!

854
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,954
Okay then!
Go on, push!

855
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,752
Now pull!
Go on, move it!

856
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,193
Whose bundle is this?

857
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,120
This one.

858
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,712
Hey, we're going to open
all the flood gates now!

859
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,555
Push forward!

860
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,351
Someone will help you push it forward.

861
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,672
Push the bundles forward!

862
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,557
They're just standing around!

863
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,513
My water is just draining!

864
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,151
Push the bundles forward, quick!

865
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,511
Push the bundles forward, damn it!

866
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,232
It can't be!

867
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,790
Hey Bashu, get rid of this stem!

868
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,112
Throw it away!

869
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,880
It's too thin.

870
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,834
No, no, no!
Just throw it away!

871
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,279
It's running now!

872
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,116
Slowly move the bundles forward!

873
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,713
Goodbye!

874
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,957
The stems will now be counted
and handed over to the forest leaseholder.

875
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:17,754
My work is done for this week.
The stems will be handed over and that's it.

876
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,316
What happens to the bamboo now?

877
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:25,231
The leaseholder's men
will transport the stems to Juri.

878
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,276
In Juri, the raftsmen
working for the wholesaler will take over.

879
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:36,675
Tomorrow I have to take care of
a few old reservoirs.

880
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,276
So we'll continue our work without a break.

881
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,916
Back to the forest.

882
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:10,149
