00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:08,007
Boss!

23
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,575
I thought you had to go out?

24
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:12,545
I sent my wife.

25
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:15,481
I'm no good at funerals.

26
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:18,184
That's not right!

27
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:21,185
It's bigger than this.
Watch what you're doing!

28
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:24,555
- Are you worried?
- About what?

29
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,626
Just leave it to him.
You don't need to worry.

30
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:30,362
You're too easy.

31
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:32,031
Watch out!

32
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:35,032
Who did this? Who put this here?

33
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,503
- Takeshi!
- Yes?

34
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:40,206
Tidy up around here, will you?

35
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,842
Right.

36
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,843
He's only 26. He's doing pretty good.

37
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:50,049
No, he's still immature.

38
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,050
It takes 20 years in a shop like this.
He's only been here five years.

39
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,855
But in those five years,
you've drummed everything into him.

40
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,491
I've even felt sorry for him
just watching.

41
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:01,492
He may be your son,
but you don't have to be so strict.

42
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:06,063
Yelling at him and slapping him...

43
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,967
Tsune.

44
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,470
It was no small feat for you and me

45
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:16,907
to make this factory what it is now.

46
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,944
That's no reason
to scold him all the time.

47
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:52,309
Hey, he's tired of waiting
and he's playing his harmonica now.

48
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,447
I haven't heard it in a long time.
He used to play it a lot.

49
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:00,986
He's sulking up there.

50
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,289
You should get him dinner
as soon as he gets home.

51
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,457
Your vegetable tempura
is too complicated.

52
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,993
Just some eel would've done.

53
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,994
You can call him down now.

54
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,031
But there's nothing here.

55
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,974
Hey, Takeshi.

56
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,975
Yes?

57
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,247
We're having tempura tonight.

58
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:29,682
Oh, that's great.

59
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,283
Come on down.

60
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:34,284
Dad, can you hang on?

61
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:38,488
I want to talk to you.

62
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:47,066
Right. That's it, huh?

63
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,867
You say that, but -

64
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,868
Well, I've been worried about it
for quite a while now.

65
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:56,673
But I've got you in charge now.
I figured you'd have some ideas.

66
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,913
That sure puts me on the spot.

67
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,914
What? You can't think of anything?

68
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:07,184
That's not true. I have some ideas.

69
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,854
Like what?

70
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,223
I think now's the time
to get more people.

71
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,859
Maybe five or six good tradesmen.

72
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,961
Well, that shouldn't be too hard.

73
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,329
Yeah, but -

74
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,064
Dear?

75
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,866
What are you doing?

76
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,568
Come on down. It's getting cold.

77
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,903
We'll be right there.

78
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,473
Now she's rushing us.

79
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:30,474
But who knows what'll happen later
after taking on that many workers.

80
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,945
Takeshi, Japan's growing
by leaps and bounds.

81
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,850
The whole economy is expanding,
so we've got to catch the wave.

82
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:44,023
Then I can do as I see fit?

83
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:47,024
If you think it's the right thing to do,
just go for it.

84
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:51,361
It's decided then.
I'm going to get another five guys.

85
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,900
Here.

86
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,901
What are you chuckling
to yourself about?

87
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:01,306
When I went upstairs

88
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:04,307
Takeshi said he had something
to talk to me about.

89
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,179
I thought I would get yelled at again.

90
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,981
You were praised instead.

91
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,850
What is this about?

92
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:14,851
I thought he was
going to bring up Kyoko.

93
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:16,422
Why?

94
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:19,423
That wasn't it?

95
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,593
Just a chat between men.

96
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:24,594
You were playing the harmonica before.
That was «Home on the Range»?

97
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:26,732
That's right.

98
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,733
The same as the record Kyoko
brought when she visited, right?

99
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:32,838
Well, anyway -

100
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,839
Remember when we met her
and she asked about hobbies?

101
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,343
I was completely stumped.

102
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,746
Why would you be stumped?

103
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:42,915
You've played the harmonica
since you were a kid.

104
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,916
But I couldn't say the harmonica
was my hobby.

105
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:49,755
We laughed so hard afterwards.

106
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:52,756
That's great. You should be proud.

107
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,426
You really think Kyoko wants
to come live with us in this house?

108
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,866
She says she can't wait.

109
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,001
- That's what the girlfriend said?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:06,002
Come, now.
Still calling her «the girlfriend»?

111
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,340
Maybe I'll call Yoshikawa
and go out fishing for a change.

112
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:14,678
Thanks.

113
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,515
What should I do?
Maybe I'll have another.

114
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:21,752
- You want me to get that?
- The burdock root tempura is tasty.

115
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:32,498
- Hey, Takeshi -
- What?

116
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:35,200
You'd better take an umbrella.

117
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:38,170
It's pretty much stopped.

118
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,139
It hasn't stopped.

119
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,240
I don't need an umbrella.

120
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,241
Oh, come on. It's rainy season.
It'll come down again.

121
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:45,410
I'm off, then.

122
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,846
- Use the umbrella.
- Right. Right.

123
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:50,847
Just be safe.
The highway can be dangerous.

124
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,726
You're lucky being an only son.
They found a nice girl for you.

125
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:07,166
It's not like I didn't do any of the work.

126
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,534
Have you decided on the wedding yet?

127
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:11,535
Yeah, they're saying
maybe September or October.

128
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:14,673
Farmers have to work it
around the seasons.

129
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,408
I wonder what Iida is like.

130
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,943
It's up the Tenryu River.

131
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,845
Way up in the Shinshu Mountains, then?

132
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:22,181
Come on.
She's not some country hick.

133
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,917
She even knows what records I like.

134
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,386
I know. Even though I met her briefly.

135
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,387
Anyway, both my parents
come from the Shinshu region.

136
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,192
They might like her more than I do.

137
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:35,360
Give me a break.
You're head over heels for her.

138
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,862
I guess.

139
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,698
Hey, you got one.

140
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,699
Another goldfish.

141
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,769
He's pretty good,
considering the youth of today,

142
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:50,106
that Takeshi of ours.

143
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:53,443
And Kyoko is a nice girl.

144
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:57,214
She's coming out
all the way from Iida.

145
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:01,885
Adorable girl.

146
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,921
Don't you think?

147
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,492
Are you asleep?

148
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:13,463
Women sure don't have any worries.

149
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,168
I'm listening.

150
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,169
If you're listening, you could answer.

151
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,339
I suppose, but what time is it?

152
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,643
The clock struck 10:00
a little while ago.

153
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:26,879
It's past 10:00?

154
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,348
So you were asleep.

155
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:31,917
Takeshi's late.

156
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:34,918
Leave him be.
It's Sunday tomorrow.

157
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,723
Kyoko is a lovely girl.

158
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:43,126
Oh, you were listening.

159
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,787
What do you want?

160
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,195
Why?

161
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:20,196
Who are you?

162
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,834
Hold it!

163
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,819
What's the matter?

164
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:44,823
You're badly injured!

165
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,458
Let's get you to the hospital!

166
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,459
- Please get him!
- Is there a hospital nearby?

167
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:51,964
Get that young man!

168
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:54,965
Hey! Someone help me!

169
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,643
Hello?

170
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:09,813
Yes?

171
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:11,984
Yukie!

172
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:14,386
Did something happen to Takeshi?

173
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,388
Someone stabbed him.

174
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,323
Stabbed? Why?

175
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,891
I don't know!

176
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:22,892
Let's get to the hospital!

177
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,429
Get yourself ready right away!

178
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,430
We don't need an umbrella!
Just lock up! Hurry up!

179
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,336
Are you all right, dear?

180
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:34,337
I'm fine! Let's hurry!

181
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:55,725
FATAL STABBING ON THE WAY HOME

182
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:59,562
TSURUMI WELDING SHOP

183
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:18,615
What a terrible thing.

184
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,420
Her husband's lost his strength.
He won't get out of bed.

185
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:24,421
I can't blame him.
It was his only son, after all.

186
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:29,359
He's in bed upstairs.

187
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:56,486
Auntie? Can you come?

188
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,864
There's a police detective
at the door.

189
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,772
Excuse me, Madam.

190
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,441
Have you found the culprit?

191
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:19,442
No. Not yet.

192
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,712
I'm returning this.
An umbrella left at the scene.

193
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,117
I think it's your son's.

194
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:31,287
Yes, it is.

195
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:36,025
And this was at the scene as well.

196
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:44,267
Yes, that's right.
He told me at the hospital

197
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:50,006
that the goldfish was for me -

198
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:54,212
Allow me to offer my respects.

199
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:57,213
Thank you.

200
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:20,637
I'll do that for you.

201
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:31,548
Auntie, you have to stay strong.

202
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,086
Uncle can't get out of bed.

203
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,923
You have to stay strong, Auntie.

204
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,924
That's right. I have to stay strong.

205
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:48,498
Go show this to Uncle.

206
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:51,469
Can you go show it to him?

207
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,439
I'll just break down again.

208
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,440
I suppose. I'll go for you.

209
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,986
Auntie, Kyoko's here with her father.

210
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:19,662
Mrs. Kawase -

211
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,833
Kyoko -

212
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,239
This is simply terrible.

213
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,741
I can't begin to express my grief.

214
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,742
Anyway, we hurried here at once.

215
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,679
Thank you for travelling so far.
Please come in.

216
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:42,118
This is Kyoko's mourning attire.

217
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:46,656
Let me take it.

218
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:49,926
It was made along with her
other wedding things.

219
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,298
Who could have known
it would be needed so soon.

220
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:56,299
Please don't say such things, Father.

221
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,973
What's happening?

222
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,974
He couldn't bear looking at it.

223
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:09,214
He said to show it to Takeshi.

224
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,215
I suppose.

225
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:15,251
My husband's upstairs.

226
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:19,222
He's been in bed since last night.

227
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,859
I'd like to see him.

228
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:25,430
Sure.

229
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:28,431
Saburo, can you go tell your uncle?

230
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,271
I'll go offer some incense first.

231
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:36,272
Please.

232
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Uncle, Kyoko's just arrived.

233
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,550
She's coming up now.

234
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,448
Mr. Kawase -

235
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,449
Did Takeshi really die?

236
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,290
Kyoko -

237
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,495
Dad,

238
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:33,496
please avenge me!

239
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:36,532
I will! I will!
I'll definitely avenge you!

240
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,970
Takeshi! Takeshi!
Dear!

241
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:48,444
SUMMER, 1940

242
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,291
SPRING, 1941

243
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,151
SPRING, 1949

244
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:04,086
It's difficult to say right now.

245
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,290
If only we could stop the bleeding.

246
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,061
The wound is deeper
than we thought.

247
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:13,062
There's a major injury
to his intestinal tract.

248
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,951
You slept well.

249
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,952
That's the best thing for you.

250
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,624
Father.

251
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,625
What is it?

252
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:46,095
What we talked about yesterday.

253
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:48,600
About what?

254
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,436
You think we can find

255
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:54,437
five or six skilled workers
so easily in these times?

256
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:59,408
We'll find them. Don't worry.

257
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,812
I have some connections.

258
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,750
I guess.

259
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,751
Don't worry about that now.

260
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,921
Don't think of anything,
and just sleep.

261
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:15,525
Just sleep.
That's what you need to do.

262
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:21,764
- Dad.
- What is it?

263
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:25,868
We need a better way...

264
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:28,873
to haul in the steel.

265
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:30,441
The way we do it now -

266
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,442
You don't have to worry about it now.

267
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,147
Don't be silly.

268
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:07,877
You should only be thinking
about getting better.

269
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:13,182
Don't think about work, all right?

270
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,825
Dad!

271
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:23,826
Get the nurse!

272
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,530
- Oh! What is it?
- Dad!

273
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,165
Nurse!

274
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,166
Please avenge me!

275
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:33,469
I will! I will!
I'll definitely avenge you!

276
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,506
Takeshi! Takeshi! Takeshi?

277
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:37,542
Dear!

278
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:40,543
Hey, Takeshi!

279
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,647
Dear!

280
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:45,648
Doctor! Takeshi!

281
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,922
Oh, Takeshi!

282
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:26,922
He's in the inner room. Go right in.

283
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:48,077
I'm sorry I couldn't be at the funeral.

284
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,380
I thought I'd offer some incense.

285
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,679
I want to express my deepest sympathy.

286
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,118
Thank you.

287
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,119
But I'm at a loss for words.

288
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:08,023
Mr. Matsuzaki, it's kind of you
to offer your sympathy,

289
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,896
but what is this?

290
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:14,897
You wrote this, right?
You covered it at the hospital.

291
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:17,468
That's right.

292
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:20,338
«According to police,

293
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,373
their investigation revealed

294
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,374
that there was no evidence of robbery,
so it might've been a random fight,

295
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:29,078
or an attack motivated by a grudge
which resulted in the stabbing».

296
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:34,617
I wrote it that way because
that was in the police report.

297
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,522
But we heard about it at the hospital.

298
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,324
A complete stranger approached him.

299
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,692
He himself told us that!

300
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,693
- But they need to have a motive -
- There is no motive!

301
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,830
They need a motive in order
to proceed with an investigation.

302
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,868
Are you saying Takeshi was lying?

303
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,404
- He wasn't lying -
- But that's what you're implying!

304
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,006
I was just -

305
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:58,007
Takeshi was not one to get into fights

306
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:01,677
or have anyone hold
a grudge against him.

307
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,048
Like I said, the police said -

308
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,784
Who cares about the police?
You're a newspaper!

309
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,419
Why can't you write the truth?

310
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,420
That's enough, Saburo.

311
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:15,124
There's no sense getting angry at him.

312
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:21,597
Takeshi wouldn't appreciate that.

313
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,769
Hello?

314
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,280
Thank you for coming the other day.

315
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:39,281
Madam, a suspect
was brought into custody.

316
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,953
Just a few minutes ago.

317
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:44,954
Dear!

318
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,394
His sister's husband
practically dragged him in.

319
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,799
He's a 19-year-old boy
by the name of Noboru Ishimoto.

320
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:00,736
Nineteen years old.

321
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,342
It was thanks to your newspaper article.

322
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:07,343
You wrote a detailed description
of his age, appearance, and clothes.

323
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:08,846
Yes.

324
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,815
That's what did it.

325
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,816
He suddenly got frightened
and apparently ran to his sister's.

326
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:17,889
They scolded him harshly.

327
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,890
It's hard to believe,
but he's practically a child.

328
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:25,461
In that rain, on that bridge -

329
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:30,199
You're saying you waited
almost an hour?

330
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,302
So why did you do it?
What was the reason?

331
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:38,574
There's no point in hiding it now.

332
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:43,345
Spit it out.

333
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:46,448
- What'll happen to me?
- What?

334
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:49,485
- Will I be executed?
- Hey, don't change the subject.

335
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,190
We can talk about all that later.

336
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:58,327
Just answer my questions.

337
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,032
It could've been anyone.

338
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:04,033
What?

339
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:07,069
It was just chance.
He just happened to come along.

340
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,609
What do you mean?

341
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,610
Hey, I want you to be straight with me.

342
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:17,181
You'll pay if you're making this up.

343
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:18,883
I'm not making it up!

344
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:21,884
I actually wanted to kill more people!

345
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:26,121
Women, old folks, and even children!

346
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:28,960
What're you saying?

347
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,895
Just shut up!

348
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:33,896
He was just unlucky enough
to come along!

349
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:36,801
After questioning him further,

350
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:39,437
we learned he'd tried to join a gang.

351
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:42,073
But they insulted him terribly.

352
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:45,074
We're looking into it now.

353
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:48,811
Where are you going, dear?

354
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:52,214
I'm going to bed.
Can you lay out the bed for me?

355
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:59,523
But he said that's what you told him.

356
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:02,524
He then got angry,
and that's what drove him -

357
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:05,096
To commit murder.

358
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:08,097
But that's his responsibility.
Don't make me an accessory to it.

359
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,268
Look. Let me be clear with you.

360
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:13,971
I was honestly
just kidding around with him.

361
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:16,374
I didn't mean anything more than that.

362
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,375
That's right.
It's exactly as you were told.

363
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:23,712
You see,
that guy was good for nothing.

364
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,784
He was raised by his stepmother.

365
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:29,653
And his dad would get drunk
and beat him up.

366
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,156
I'm not surprised he's all messed up.

367
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:35,157
Even with work, or anything,
he just never got along with anyone.

368
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,796
No wonder he goes out
and does something stupid.

369
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,644
How about dinner, dear?

370
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:03,020
Dear,

371
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:06,021
we'd better let Kyoko know as well.

372
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:16,865
She's been so unfortunate.

373
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,170
I hope she eventually finds
a good husband.

374
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:32,514
Kyoko really loved Takeshi.

375
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:39,321
Kyoko mentioned before she left

376
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:43,192
that she was worried about your eyes.

377
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:47,696
How does she know about my eyes?

378
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:51,366
Takeshi's known of it for some time,

379
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,403
even before I noticed.

380
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:57,573
Well, I guess it was
quite a long time ago.

381
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:01,844
When I was still working
at the Oppama car plant.

382
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,180
I went to see my dad
at our metal shop.

383
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,720
I noticed my dad stumbling a lot.

384
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:12,721
I wondered why
he was in such a rush.

385
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:16,225
I wondered then if maybe he wasn't
able to see his feet properly.

386
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:20,362
- Did you mention this to your father?
- Yeah, I told him to see a doctor.

387
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,036
But he'd have none of it.

388
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:28,205
And he got angry when I kept at him.

389
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:31,206
As you know, he's a stubborn man.

390
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:34,843
But I could tell from his expression
that he was aware.

391
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:41,483
Is that why you quit the car factory?

392
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:44,853
You wanted to help your father?

393
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:48,857
I wasn't feeling pity for my dad.

394
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,695
I don't know how to put it.

395
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,700
I was just impressed with him.

396
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:59,701
I'd never realized that before.

397
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:02,173
So -

398
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:05,174
maybe I just thought
I wanted to be more like him.

399
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:10,979
Takeshi said that?

400
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,750
He wanted to be
a good successor to you.

401
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:19,790
He was working hard for that.

402
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,791
No matter how much you yelled at him.

403
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,929
Hey, play that record for me.

404
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,899
What record?

405
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,535
You know the one.

406
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:33,804
I can't.

407
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,805
It'll just lead to tears.

408
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:40,108
But I need to cry.

409
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:43,779
I want to cry to soothe my heart!

410
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:53,455
You've got to eat more, dear.

411
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:58,594
For what purpose?

412
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:03,534
Takeshi was killed.

413
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,535
I can't believe you can just sit there
and eat so calmly.

414
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:21,483
You say things like that
and I bet Takeshi would be mad at you.

415
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:25,456
Stupid boy.

416
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:28,457
What kind of son
dies before his parents?

417
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:55,052
Stupid boy!

418
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:58,053
A proper craftsman
puts his body into it!

419
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,690
You got that?

420
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:27,849
Takeshi, I don't want to live anymore.

421
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:33,889
There's no point.
No point to being alive.

422
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,667
Tsune.

423
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:48,737
Sorry to put this on you,
but can you manage it for a while?

424
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:53,777
Manage what?

425
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:56,380
The metal shop.

426
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,982
I'll let you manage it.

427
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:01,983
Come on. What are you saying?

428
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:05,487
I forced myself to go back there,

429
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:11,126
but I just couldn't -

430
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:14,796
It's tough

431
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,966
being at the shop.

432
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:21,703
Well, I'm sure the memories
must come back.

433
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,643
Please.

434
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:41,418
He goes to the grave every day?

435
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:43,220
Yes.

436
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:45,856
Even on rainy days.

437
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:48,826
Uncle's going to ruin his health.

438
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,827
Well, he wouldn't even
leave the house before.

439
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:56,698
Maybe this is better.

440
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:59,536
Do you want me to stay for a while?

441
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:02,372
Maybe he's lonely.

442
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:05,373
Maybe you can come occasionally.

443
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,079
But finding a grave site so close
sure was a good thing.

444
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,282
It would've been tough
if he had to travel far.

445
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:24,426
Listen, Sabu.

446
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,896
I think he wants to die.

447
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:42,944
I can tell that very easily.

448
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:56,558
That's why he won't eat.

449
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:19,748
I guess that's what it means.

450
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:24,819
Revenge.

451
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,990
I just don't know how to get revenge.

452
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,430
Takeshi,

453
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:39,701
how am I to do it?

454
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:10,732
Tomorrow morning at 10:00,
at Yokohama District Court.

455
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:12,803
I figured you wouldn't have known.

456
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:15,804
We haven't heard from anyone,
neither the police nor the court.

457
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:20,141
Well, that's no surprise.

458
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:23,211
- Please.
- Oh, thank you.

459
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,748
- Please come in.
- Yes. Thank you.

460
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:35,724
- Here.
- Thank you.

461
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:40,998
Why wouldn't they tell us?

462
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,999
Well, its just not their custom.

463
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,435
Except for specific summons
to appear as witnesses,

464
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,740
there's no precedent
for notifying victims.

465
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,312
Then we're just abandoned?

466
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:58,313
Abandoned?
Well, its just the way the system works.

467
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:04,452
I see. I didn't know any of this.

468
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:09,624
You might feel you don't want
to see the assailant's face.

469
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:13,363
But if you do wish to,
you're free to attend the hearing.

470
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:16,364
Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know.

471
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:19,503
Thank you.

472
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:21,104
Hello?

473
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:24,105
They're back.

474
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,743
The trial's tomorrow.

475
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:28,645
At 10:00 in the morning.

476
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:31,114
- Where?
- The court in Yokohama.

477
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:32,549
Who's here?

478
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,550
Mr. Matsuzaki came all this way to -

479
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,290
You're back.

480
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:43,291
Mr. Matsuzaki,
so it finally starts tomorrow?

481
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:47,529
You've waited five months.

482
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,641
Oh, hello.

483
00:39:57,642 --> 00:40:00,642
I thought I'd better come before
you had a reason to yell at me.

484
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:04,081
Not at all. I'm grateful to you.

485
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:07,082
Well, I came because
I've become fond of Mr. Kawase.

486
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:13,321
But it'll still be a long while
before there's a verdict, right?

487
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,494
Yes, there'll be several sessions.

488
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:19,596
But this one's simple.
They know exactly what happened.

489
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:22,132
That's not how trials work.

490
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,768
They'll let him off easy.

491
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:26,903
He's still a minor.

492
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,904
Well, as far as that goes -

493
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,875
Takeshi's dead,
and the killer keeps on living.

494
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,764
Dad,

495
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:30,765
please avenge me!

496
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:34,035
I will! I will!
I'll definitely avenge you!

497
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:37,007
Takeshi!

498
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:40,008
YOKOHAMA DISTRICT COURT

499
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:54,689
What a gloomy building.

500
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:59,227
Well, it is a courthouse.
A dismal place.

501
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:03,667
Not a place to come too often.

502
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:06,668
Of course not.

503
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:10,138
Maybe we should go in now.

504
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:13,942
Yes. I suppose.

505
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:23,718
Hey, isn't that the -

506
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:34,764
You're the one that killed Takeshi!

507
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,933
Stop it!

508
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,603
Uncle, stop it!

509
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:42,339
Dear!

510
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,574
Stop!

511
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,443
I'm going to kill him!

512
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:47,811
What -

513
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:50,812
What do you think
you're doing, Uncle?

514
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,250
You'll end up in jail, too!

515
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:58,586
And then what?

516
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:04,158
Where did you get this?

517
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,164
This is a courthouse.

518
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:11,165
Please remain quiet,
or you'll be found in contempt.

519
00:43:13,137 --> 00:43:15,005
I'm sorry.

520
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:18,006
Who is he?

521
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:21,509
The father of Takeshi Kawase,
the murder victim.

522
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,649
And this is his mother.

523
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,650
And I'm his cousin.

524
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:33,321
The hearing is about to begin.

525
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:36,626
Then, it's all right?

526
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:38,161
What is?

527
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:39,996
Considering what just happened -

528
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:42,997
I didn't see anything.

529
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:50,605
What do you want to do, Auntie?

530
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:54,142
Maybe we should just go home.

531
00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:02,116
Let's at least attend the hearing.

532
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:08,556
Are you all right?

533
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:31,379
FEBRUARY 27, 1967

534
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:36,851
SENTENCING

535
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:13,121
Is that the court-appointed attorney?

536
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:16,426
That's right.

537
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:19,427
They say he has a family -

538
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,630
But they didn't hire a lawyer for him.

539
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,268
So that's how it is.

540
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:28,269
All rise!

541
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:43,117
The court is now in session.

542
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:46,954
In the murder trial of the defendant,
Noboru Ishimoto,

543
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:51,459
the sentence shall now be given.

544
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:54,462
The defendant shall step forward.

545
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:10,378
The defendant is sentenced to a term of
at least five years but no greater than 10.

546
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:15,583
The defendant is sentenced to a term of
at least five years but no greater than 10.

547
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,190
The 160 days of remand
shall apply towards the sentence.

548
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:27,163
Facts and reasons
as they pertain to the sentence.

549
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:30,164
The defendant has had a habit
of stealing since childhood.

550
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:34,535
He attended elementary school
at a Kanagawa correctional institution

551
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:40,508
from which he escaped
before graduating.

552
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,513
He delivered newspapers but was sent
to a reform school after committing theft.

553
00:46:47,485 --> 00:46:50,485
He was released in January of 1966.

554
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,625
As the accused is a minor,

555
00:46:57,828 --> 00:47:00,828
consideration is given to him
as one with future prospects,

556
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,134
and an opportunity is granted
to redeem himself in the future.

557
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:07,135
Does it make you feel better
to repeat that over and over?

558
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:10,240
I want Takeshi to hear it!

559
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:13,241
That kid was given...

560
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:16,277
a lawyer paid for by the state.

561
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:20,581
They sure are considerate of him,
to have him redeem himself.

562
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:25,753
He's in for a period
of five to 10 years,

563
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,090
which means he could be out
in as soon as five years!

564
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:34,595
After killing for no reason -

565
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:38,332
What about the victim?

566
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:41,804
No one's thinking of Takeshi!

567
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:44,805
Nothing for being killed!

568
00:47:44,808 --> 00:47:47,808
The trial is held according to the law.

569
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:50,978
The law is wrong!

570
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:54,384
They say a guy like that has a future.

571
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:57,385
I guess they mean
Takeshi doesn't have one.

572
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:01,090
That's no punishment.

573
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:03,326
They're protecting a killer.
That's all.

574
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,327
TSURUMI WARD OFFICE

575
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:10,066
LAW COUNSELLING

576
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:12,869
I understand how you feel.

577
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,171
But the law is as I've already explained.

578
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:18,172
There's no law in Japan that considers
the family of a murder victim?

579
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,813
Or a man killed through
no fault of his own?

580
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:26,449
That's not so.
There are some provisions.

581
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,450
What would they be?
Please tell me.

582
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:40,795
There's a law concerning compensation
for those cooperating with police.

583
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,667
In other words,
if you were cooperating with police,

584
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:50,571
and you were injured in the course
of trying to subdue an assailant,

585
00:48:53,143 --> 00:48:55,345
you can get compensation
from the state.

586
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:58,346
Maritime safety officials
are also covered in the same way.

587
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:00,883
And -

588
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:03,884
there's a law concerning compensation
for witnesses at a trial.

589
00:49:05,022 --> 00:49:08,022
This is for cases in which
there is retribution against you

590
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:12,528
for appearing as a witness in court.

591
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:14,597
There's state compensation for that.

592
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:16,132
Is that all?

593
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:18,635
I think so -

594
00:49:18,636 --> 00:49:21,170
So there's nothing that applies to us.

595
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:24,171
Yes. As far as compensation goes.

596
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:28,442
I didn't come because I wanted money.

597
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:34,882
What judgments do the law courts
make anyway?

598
00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:38,621
They take good care of the criminal,

599
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:41,622
but they do nothing for us victims.

600
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:57,204
I'm home.

601
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:02,912
Hello.

602
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:04,814
I'm exhausted.

603
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:06,449
What is this?

604
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,685
- They're books.
- Books?

605
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:11,187
They sure are heavy.

606
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:13,423
They didn't seem heavy
when I bought them.

607
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:16,424
Was I wrong.

608
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:24,967
Yukie, get me some scissors.

609
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,968
Sure.

610
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:57,033
They're all law books?

611
00:50:57,034 --> 00:51:00,034
Isn't that great?

612
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:02,972
What're you going to do with these?

613
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:05,973
I'm going to read and study them.

614
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:08,478
Study them?

615
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:11,280
Going back to college or something?

616
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:13,950
Don't be silly.

617
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:16,951
People like us don't know much
about the law.

618
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:21,155
We have to educate ourselves, right?

619
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:26,894
The goldfish look weak.
Did you feed them?

620
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:30,631
Just a while ago.

621
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:36,971
I want you guys to stay healthy.

622
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:40,007
I've got to stay healthy, too.
You never know what'll come up.

623
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:44,478
But you think you can read
all these difficult books?

624
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:50,618
I have no choice but to read them.

625
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:54,789
«Criminal Procedure Law». Right?

626
00:51:57,127 --> 00:52:00,127
I'm counting on you.

627
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:03,531
Madam.

628
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:06,969
Well, it's been a while.

629
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,639
It's gotten warmer now.

630
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,741
How is your husband?

631
00:52:11,742 --> 00:52:14,010
He's gotten better.

632
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:15,511
Still visiting the grave?

633
00:52:15,512 --> 00:52:18,512
He is. But only about once a week.

634
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:21,184
He's gotten very busy of late.

635
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:24,185
Signs and recognition of facts
corresponding to actus reus.

636
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:36,297
Rejection of illegality.

637
00:52:46,877 --> 00:52:49,212
What does this mean?

638
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:52,213
Why don't they write
it in plain Japanese?

639
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:56,317
What a surprise.
I never would have imagined.

640
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:02,091
It's a bit frightening, actually.

641
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:04,627
For such an upright, law-abiding man

642
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:07,628
to say that the law is wrong.

643
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:11,332
I came today because there's
someone he might want to meet.

644
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:14,537
And -

645
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:16,606
A doctor?

646
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,242
No, that's not it.

647
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:22,243
Mr. Nakazawa
runs a building products business.

648
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:25,779
His daughter was murdered
early last year.

649
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:30,317
It was a similar type of incident
to your son's.

650
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:33,921
By early last year, that means
two or three months before our son.

651
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:38,559
Yes. There have been
many similar incidents lately.

652
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,130
It was an enormous blow to him,
but he's recovering,

653
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,269
and from what I've learned,

654
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:49,270
he's hoping to draw public attention
to the predicament of crime victims.

655
00:53:51,074 --> 00:53:54,074
Draw public attention?

656
00:53:54,177 --> 00:53:56,145
He's in Nerima?

657
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:59,146
She was in the third year of university.

658
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:04,351
She was born late in the year,

659
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:07,721
so had just turned 20.

660
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:11,992
She was studying piano

661
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,930
and had gone out in the afternoon
for her lesson.

662
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,170
However -

663
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:47,995
Somebody!

664
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:54,435
Somebody!

665
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:57,173
Hold it!

666
00:54:57,174 --> 00:55:00,174
Stop that man!

667
00:55:07,217 --> 00:55:10,217
There were six stab wounds.

668
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:15,289
One of them proved fatal.

669
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:21,895
She passed away before
they could even call an ambulance.

670
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,401
And the assailant?

671
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:28,204
They said he was 26 years old.

672
00:55:28,205 --> 00:55:30,239
Hate what? What do you hate?

673
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Everything! It's not interesting to me!

674
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:37,611
Couldn't care what happens
to the world!

675
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:41,715
That's when you decided to kill?

676
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:47,223
It didn't matter who it was.

677
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:49,225
I would've done in anyone
who came along.

678
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:50,893
But you were hiding in -

679
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:52,895
Yeah.

680
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:54,664
I wanted to get a woman.

681
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:57,665
I hate women the most.
Makes me sick just seeing them!

682
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:04,004
I figured I'd do a woman
if I was going to kill.

683
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:08,008
She came wandering in like that.
It's all her fault.

684
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:13,447
It sounds like my son's case.
Exactly the same.

685
00:56:15,152 --> 00:56:16,752
And the trial?

686
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:19,622
He was sentenced to 15 years.

687
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:22,124
Fifteen years.

688
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:24,794
Not the death sentence?

689
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:27,795
They said that was the «going rate».

690
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,700
What's a «going rate?»

691
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:32,201
Who decided that?

692
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:35,004
Well, I'd say that

693
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:38,005
people far away from our situation
made that decision.

694
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:42,976
Then I suppose the five to 10 years
in my son's case is also the «going rate?»

695
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:46,816
That may be so.

696
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:49,752
That's absurd.

697
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:52,753
I can't accept that.

698
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,624
There's something wrong.

699
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,625
I'm not going to back down
until this is straightened out!

700
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:05,165
But going after the killer now

701
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:10,172
won't bring back those that were killed.

702
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:13,173
But still, Mr. Nakazawa -

703
00:57:15,545 --> 00:57:18,545
To build a world free of such
vicious crimes -

704
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:24,685
I wouldn't want my daughter's death
to be for naught.

705
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,590
So I'm trying to figure out what to do.

706
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:34,027
That's all I think about.

707
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:37,366
I could never feel -

708
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:40,367
It's as though you've reached
a state of enlightenment.

709
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:45,405
I'm no match for that.

710
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:50,577
Mr. Nakazawa.

711
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,847
Was that daughter your only child?

712
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:57,317
I have two older sons.

713
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:01,755
I see.

714
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:05,959
You're very fortunate, unlike me.

715
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:12,501
Mr. Kawase.

716
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:15,502
I had three children.

717
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:19,973
One is gone, but I have two left.

718
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:23,277
Do you think thats any consolation?

719
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:42,262
I've said such a terrible thing.

720
00:58:45,368 --> 00:58:48,368
You know, Mr. Kawase,

721
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:52,339
I'm being obstinate.

722
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:57,010
I'm putting too much on others
and myself, too.

723
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:03,483
How else can I go on living?

724
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:09,289
I find I can't even work.

725
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:13,994
But there's one thing I realized
after the incident.

726
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:18,532
And it's that there's a surprising
number of people who share our fate.

727
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,340
I've been reading the papers, too.

728
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:29,845
I never noticed before Takeshi's case

729
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:32,815
that there are so many.

730
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:35,117
What do you think?

731
00:59:35,118 --> 00:59:38,118
Maybe we can join forces
and change some things.

732
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:39,288
Join forces?

733
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:42,289
Perhaps we can raise
public awareness about this.

734
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:53,333
Oh, there's Uncle. Uncle's here!

735
00:59:53,536 --> 00:59:54,870
I'll have your prints ready for you.

736
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:56,205
Yes. Thank you.

737
00:59:56,206 --> 00:59:59,206
Thank you.

738
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,277
Hello, Uncle.

739
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:02,678
I wanted to talk to you.

740
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:05,414
Well, how unusual.

741
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:08,415
It's been a while since
I've come to this shop.

742
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:10,653
What did you want to talk about?

743
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:13,654
You once told me about
a nearby welding shop.

744
01:00:14,624 --> 01:00:16,825
Yeah. A regular customer.

745
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:18,160
And he wants to expand?

746
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:21,161
Yeah. He said business is good,
and he wants to expand.

747
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,633
What were you thinking?

748
01:00:24,634 --> 01:00:27,569
I wonder if he'd buy our place?

749
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,638
My shop.

750
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:32,639
What'll you do
if you sell the metal shop?

751
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:37,980
There's something I'm thinking about.

752
01:00:37,981 --> 01:00:40,981
You decided this after talking
with Mr. Nakazawa?

753
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:46,253
He's not in a position
to take time off work.

754
01:00:48,124 --> 01:00:51,124
He can't do the legwork,
so I said I would -

755
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:56,496
It'll cost money.

756
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:01,168
And I can't be dedicated
to the metal shop.

757
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:06,773
I'll end up burdening Tsune
and the rest of them.

758
01:01:09,446 --> 01:01:12,446
That's why I think
it's best to get out.

759
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,850
Have you made a deal to sell?

760
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:19,688
Well, they're really interested.

761
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:22,024
They're coming to look tomorrow.

762
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:25,025
Of course they'll keep the people
who work there now.

763
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,469
Are you angry?

764
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,470
For doing this
before talking it over?

765
01:01:37,474 --> 01:01:40,474
Why would I be angry?

766
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:46,246
I feel this is the only way
to avenge Takeshi's death.

767
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:52,152
I can never forgive
the man who killed him.

768
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:56,356
Obsessing over that rotten man
will make me a rotten man.

769
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:02,162
When I think that way,
I just can't stop.

770
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,100
I don't know what it is, but I feel
that time is passing me by.

771
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:14,841
I know it might mean
some hardship for you,

772
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:19,346
but I hope you'll support me.

773
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,455
Even if I were to say I'm against it,

774
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:29,456
you're not one to back down.

775
01:02:32,662 --> 01:02:35,097
Fine.

776
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:38,098
If thats what you've decided.
Do as you please.

777
01:02:38,668 --> 01:02:40,836
Right.

778
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:43,837
There's not much more in life
that I want to do.

779
01:02:46,943 --> 01:02:48,844
I'm sorry.

780
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:50,946
You really are something.

781
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:53,947
I'm so grateful to you.

782
01:02:59,222 --> 01:03:02,222
What's the matter, dear?
Why are you crying?

783
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:07,327
You've cried all the tears you wanted
whenever it suited you!

784
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:13,366
You even stayed in bed
throughout the funeral!

785
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:18,071
I've been holding it together
for so long!

786
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:22,042
I've wanted to cry, too!

787
01:03:22,378 --> 01:03:23,846
Takeshi!

788
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:26,847
You were everything to me!

789
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:29,885
My dear.

790
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:32,886
Takeshi!
Oh, dear!

791
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:35,624
You silly -

792
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:38,625
Dear.

793
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:52,038
I'm so sorry.

794
01:03:56,713 --> 01:03:58,814
You silly -

795
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:01,815
I'm so sorry.

796
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:05,218
SPRING, 1966

797
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:15,764
Here it comes.

798
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:17,266
Come on. Don't cut in line.

799
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:20,267
Get to the back of the line.
We've all been waiting.

800
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:22,938
- What do you want?
- Stop that!

801
01:04:22,939 --> 01:04:25,274
Everyone's been waiting their turn!

802
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:28,275
What're you doing?

803
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:54,401
Please.

804
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:02,409
You didn't have to -

805
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:07,881
Thank you very much.

806
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:14,487
Hey, boys. Come on over here.
I've got some sweets.

807
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:16,558
Oh, you needn't have.

808
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,559
- Come on. Here.
- Thank you.

809
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:25,332
My husband loved them.

810
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:28,535
He was a truly great father to them.

811
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:32,172
How could such a thing happen to him?

812
01:05:33,343 --> 01:05:36,343
He was a quiet man.
I never thought he'd confront such men.

813
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:42,148
I just couldn't believe it.

814
01:05:42,185 --> 01:05:45,185
Who were the assailants?

815
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,990
Members of a gang?

816
01:05:50,126 --> 01:05:52,894
They worked for the fire department.

817
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,895
They'd been drinking.

818
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:00,333
Its just bad luck.
I suppose I should give up.

819
01:06:01,537 --> 01:06:04,039
No. You've got that wrong.

820
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,040
That's why I'm here.

821
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:12,381
If you don't mind,

822
01:06:12,382 --> 01:06:15,382
may I ask how you make ends meet?

823
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:20,353
I manage somehow, on welfare.

824
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:24,559
I didn't get any worker's compensation.

825
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,560
There was a little retirement benefit.

826
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:31,631
I could go out and work,

827
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:34,934
but I'm not in very good health.

828
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:39,906
I heard you filed a suit
for accident compensation.

829
01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:45,979
I was researching that,
and I came across your case.

830
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:49,215
A lawyer suggested it.

831
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:52,719
Since they were government employees,
I was told I could get state compensation.

832
01:06:56,359 --> 01:06:58,260
But it didn't work out.

833
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:00,696
What did the court have to say?

834
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:03,697
They said a lot of things
I couldn't understand.

835
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:06,966
About how my husband didn't have
any authority in that instance.

836
01:07:08,971 --> 01:07:11,971
Basically, he wasn't directly affected
when they cut into the line.

837
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:18,511
There was no real need
for him to stop them.

838
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,917
What on earth?

839
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:24,918
They just saw it as an ordinary fight.

840
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:28,457
And if it's a fight,
my husband shares the blame, too.

841
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:31,360
That's absurd.

842
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:34,361
No wonder people feel
they're better off being apathetic.

843
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,868
But it encourages violence.

844
01:07:39,869 --> 01:07:42,869
It's too late now.

845
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:47,974
Even I wish that he had
kept to himself.

846
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:54,647
I wish he was apathetic, too.

847
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:29,349
STABBED TO DEATH IN FIGHT

848
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,500
TENRYU RIVER

849
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:59,946
TENRYU GORGE

850
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:15,662
Takeshi, I've embarked
on a major quest.

851
01:09:20,236 --> 01:09:23,236
To create a world
free of murder victims,

852
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:26,406
we're going to get legislation
that will help victims families.

853
01:09:29,278 --> 01:09:32,278
This is my way of getting revenge.
You watch me.

854
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:37,484
I won't give up until it's done.

855
01:10:00,443 --> 01:10:03,443
What debt are you collecting, Mister?

856
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:07,749
For the outboard motor?
Or the chicken coop?

857
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,984
Debt?

858
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:11,052
You're here to collect, right?

859
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:13,255
We have no money.

860
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:16,124
If you want anything,
go ahead and take it!

861
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:19,125
I didn't come for that.

862
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:21,596
It couldn't be anything good.

863
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:23,899
Just remember one thing.

864
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,668
My dad did nothing wrong,

865
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:28,637
but he still got killed!

866
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:31,638
That's right. I know all about it.

867
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:34,874
Who are you talking to, Satoru?

868
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:38,811
Hello.

869
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,050
ELDERLY MAN LIVING ALONE SLAIN

870
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:44,052
NOTE LEFT NEXT TO BODY
AFTER TRAFFIC ACCIDENT

871
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:47,053
SPRING, 1968

872
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,590
WOMAN SLAIN ON STREET

873
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,834
- Hello.
- Oh, come in.

874
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:02,835
Nice day today. It feels good.

875
01:11:07,043 --> 01:11:09,844
I see you're busy as ever.

876
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:12,414
Oh, is Uncle out again today?

877
01:11:12,415 --> 01:11:15,415
Today?
He's been doing overnight trips lately.

878
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:19,487
He's in Matsumoto today.

879
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:21,389
Matsumoto?

880
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:24,390
It's been a while since
he's been to Shinshu.

881
01:11:25,728 --> 01:11:28,728
Spring in Shinshu must be nice.

882
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:32,332
He was up before sunrise,
and off he went.

883
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:36,035
- This is the list of victims?
- Yes.

884
01:11:36,706 --> 01:11:39,040
You put this together?

885
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:42,041
A lot of names, aren't there?

886
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:44,546
Over 100 now.

887
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:47,547
And that's not even half.

888
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:50,817
Is the victims' association going well?

889
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:54,654
Well, he doesn't talk much
when he gets home now.

890
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:00,159
He just seems lost in thought.

891
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:03,396
Some families even turn him away...

892
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:06,799
like he was a peddler or something.

893
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:10,805
That must be tough for Uncle.

894
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:13,806
SHINSHU IIDA

895
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,727
Mr. Kawase!

896
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:38,231
Welcome! I've been waiting!

897
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:42,370
Since I was in Matsumoto -

898
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:45,371
- I was so happy to get your call.
- I really wanted to see you.

899
01:12:48,044 --> 01:12:50,745
Thanks for coming.

900
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:52,714
Now, come this way.

901
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:55,715
Thank you.

902
01:13:08,798 --> 01:13:11,798
The mountains look the same

903
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:15,068
as when I was a kid.

904
01:13:15,237 --> 01:13:18,237
My family all happen to be out today.

905
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:22,809
Your mother and father, too?

906
01:13:23,212 --> 01:13:26,212
They've gone off to Suwa.
Some business there.

907
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:30,249
Then I'm glad the two of us
have a chance to talk.

908
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:35,354
Yes. I prefer it that way.

909
01:13:41,297 --> 01:13:44,297
I was a bit naive.

910
01:13:46,302 --> 01:13:48,470
We've all shared similar experiences,

911
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:51,471
so I assumed they'd all get on board.

912
01:13:53,109 --> 01:13:56,109
After all, these sorts of tragedies
can happen to anyone.

913
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:01,916
I just don't understand it.

914
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:04,486
There were some people

915
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:07,487
who thought I was there
to take advantage of them.

916
01:14:08,357 --> 01:14:11,357
They were very suspicious of me.

917
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:15,027
They wouldn't even invite me in.

918
01:14:15,531 --> 01:14:17,866
I can imagine.

919
01:14:17,867 --> 01:14:20,867
I think thats to be expected.

920
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:22,937
You think?

921
01:14:22,938 --> 01:14:25,938
No one wants to dwell
on dark feelings

922
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:29,842
from a horrible tragedy
like having a loved one killed.

923
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:33,681
Rather than face up to it,

924
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,682
they would rather
erase it from their lives.

925
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,520
To think of it as something
from another world,

926
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,023
and cast it away.

927
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:48,828
I've felt that way, too.

928
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:51,998
You, Kyoko?

929
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:55,001
I was Takeshi's fiancee, after all.

930
01:14:55,237 --> 01:14:57,906
People are outwardly
sympathetic to me,

931
01:14:57,907 --> 01:15:00,907
but behind my back
they see me as a bad omen.

932
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:04,479
I didn't realize.

933
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,480
That's why I work at home
making gift decorations.

934
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:12,554
Isn't it ironic?

935
01:15:12,555 --> 01:15:15,555
Take a look at these.

936
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:25,064
So you're not going to marry?

937
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:28,601
I'm just not ready for that.

938
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:33,272
But you need to move on.

939
01:15:34,476 --> 01:15:37,476
My wife's worried about you, too.

940
01:15:38,113 --> 01:15:41,113
You have to find a good man soon.

941
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:50,489
What's the matter?

942
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:54,660
I said that my father and mother
went to Sawa.

943
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:58,097
It wasn't because of business.

944
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:02,268
They said they had no connection
to you after the tragedy.

945
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:08,341
It's all right.

946
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:11,344
I can't blame them.

947
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:14,981
That's why I said I was glad
to have you to myself.

948
01:16:19,221 --> 01:16:21,389
I'm sorry.

949
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,390
It's nothing for you to be sorry about.

950
01:16:24,493 --> 01:16:27,493
I'm determined to fight as hard as ever.

951
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,108
Please sign! Please sign!

952
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:42,377

STATE COMPENSATION DEMANDED
FOR FAMILIES OF CRIME VICTIMS

959
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,992
We're gathering signatures for
a petition to present to parliament.

960
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:00,993
We want legislation that will help
the families of crime victims.

961
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,230
That's what this petition is for.

962
01:17:04,433 --> 01:17:06,634
Please sign the petition.

963
01:17:06,635 --> 01:17:09,635
Please sign. Here.

964
01:17:10,406 --> 01:17:11,539
Please.

965
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:14,540
Please sign the petition.

966
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:18,279
MARCH 1969

967
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,280
«Opinion of the Ministry of Justice.

968
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:24,684
For the families of murder victims
we feel the utmost sympathy.

969
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:31,757
The question of state responsibility
to compensate such victims'

970
01:17:32,728 --> 01:17:35,728
involves many issues
that require further study.

971
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,700
The government must carefully
study the need for legislation».

972
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:45,406
Is this all?

973
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:48,407
That's right. That's all.

974
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:51,579
«They must carefully study the need -»

975
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,580
In other words, they'll do nothing.

976
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:57,883
It seems so,
by the way they've written it.

977
01:17:57,886 --> 01:18:00,886
We've basically been shown the door.

978
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:04,425
They're just saying
they'll accept our opinion.

979
01:18:04,426 --> 01:18:06,127
That's right.

980
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:08,930
It's a terrible way to treat people.

981
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:11,699
It's been six months
since we presented.

982
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:14,700
They make us wait six months,
and this is their answer.

983
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:18,471
We were in the papers
during the petition drive.

984
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:23,478
Many people came up to me to say

985
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:26,479
that there are all kinds of people
facing hardships.

986
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:30,816
That's what welfare is for.

987
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:34,854
Why would only the surviving families
of murder victims get -

988
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:38,126
I've heard the same thing
from many people.

989
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:41,127
So the government is probably
thinking along the same lines.

990
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:45,131
It's not unreasonable.
We thought it over for a whole month.

991
01:18:45,968 --> 01:18:48,968
There are big differences.

992
01:18:49,304 --> 01:18:52,304
This petition makes it clear, too.

993
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:54,208
Take a traffic accident, say -

994
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:57,209
You could be walking down the street
and lose your life.

995
01:18:58,781 --> 01:19:01,781
But there's compensation for that.

996
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:05,017
They might say it's because
the driver is insured.

997
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:08,421
But the point is there's a law for that.

998
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:11,524
You think some crazy murderer
can pay any compensation?

999
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:16,695
That's why we're appealing
to the state.

1000
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:19,801
The state is the only -

1001
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:22,203
I understand that.

1002
01:19:22,204 --> 01:19:25,173
I've thought this through as well.

1003
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:28,174
But Mr. Nakazawa, I'm not giving up.

1004
01:19:29,178 --> 01:19:32,178
I'm not one to back down
after getting an answer like this.

1005
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:36,384
Of course. I'm not giving up either.

1006
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:39,385
I'll even go to Kyushu or Hokkaido.

1007
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:43,322
I'll get as many people as I can
to join our association.

1008
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:54,233
Like you said at the start,

1009
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:57,503
theres just no other way.

1010
01:19:57,906 --> 01:20:00,906
We have to expand this campaign
nationwide and appeal to the public.

1011
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:06,645
Mr. Nakazawa,
I know you're a busy man,

1012
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:10,017
but can you do the rounds
in the Tokyo area?

1013
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:13,018
Of course I can.

1014
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:14,589
But Madam -

1015
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:17,590
I've already prepared myself for this.

1016
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,560
He can go where he pleases,
across the country or wherever.

1017
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:27,333
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL MURDERED

1018
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:31,606
ASSAULTED
ON WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL

1019
01:20:31,607 --> 01:20:34,607
ON THE BANKS OF THE GOHYAKU RIVER
IN OMOTEYAZAWA, MOTOMIYA

1020
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:45,451
I'm amazed you quit smoking.

1021
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:48,687
You used to get all irritated
and smoke at times like these.

1022
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,526
I didn't quit.

1023
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:54,527
I just forgot.

1024
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,830
It was from that day.

1025
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:04,136
You must be tired,
saying things like that.

1026
01:21:05,307 --> 01:21:08,307
Never mind me,
I'm worried about you.

1027
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:11,911
Oh, I'm used to travelling.

1028
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:15,581
I worry about you.

1029
01:21:15,884 --> 01:21:18,884
I'm glad I came with you.

1030
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:23,589
But I wonder if it's going to stay
this packed all the way.

1031
01:21:26,895 --> 01:21:29,895
It's been 10 years since we took a trip,
and this is it.

1032
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:36,335
FUKUSHIMA CITY

1033
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:42,374
INN

1034
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:52,653
Is the washroom downstairs?

1035
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:55,654
Yes. At the bottom of the stairs.

1036
01:21:55,757 --> 01:21:58,326
Oh, are you not able to see?

1037
01:21:58,327 --> 01:22:01,295
No. That's not exactly right.

1038
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:04,296
Please turn off the lights in the hall
when you don't need them.

1039
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:09,670
It's a waste of electricity, after all.

1040
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:12,473
Yes, indeed. You're right.

1041
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:14,709
Would you like dinner right way?

1042
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:17,710
Maybe we'll take a bath first.

1043
01:22:18,513 --> 01:22:20,881
Oh, that might be nice.

1044
01:22:20,882 --> 01:22:23,882
You must be tired.
The bathhouse is very close.

1045
01:22:26,188 --> 01:22:28,990
Go out onto the front street,

1046
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:31,359
and back toward the station,

1047
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,360
and around the second corner.

1048
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:37,730
I'll leave the clogs out in the foyer.

1049
01:22:42,738 --> 01:22:45,738
The light switch for the hall is a string
hanging down at the end.

1050
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:50,511
Let's not be wasteful.

1051
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:53,512
Yes. We understand.

1052
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:09,061
MOTOMIYA, ADACHI

1053
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:14,967
Her bicycle was found
in this area.

1054
01:23:18,106 --> 01:23:21,106
My daughter's body was found
the following morning

1055
01:23:22,077 --> 01:23:25,077
in the woods.

1056
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:29,882
She finished volleyball practice
and left school at the usual time.

1057
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:36,221
It's dark at night,
but there are houses nearby.

1058
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:41,226
I wasn't really worried.

1059
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:46,031
The assailant was waiting
as though stalking his prey.

1060
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:50,569
A complete stranger.

1061
01:23:50,772 --> 01:23:53,772
The way he tells it,

1062
01:23:53,842 --> 01:23:56,842
he quickly strangled her -

1063
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:04,917
Anyway, you came at a good time.

1064
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:08,456
The 7th day services are over.

1065
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:11,457
I've finally come to accept

1066
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,495
that my daughter is dead.

1067
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:17,496
I was beginning to feel
a great emptiness within me.

1068
01:24:21,036 --> 01:24:24,036
If you'd come any earlier, I probably
wouldn't have wanted to talk.

1069
01:24:27,175 --> 01:24:29,810
Yes.

1070
01:24:29,811 --> 01:24:32,811
It's like that with everyone.

1071
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:37,618
1946

1072
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:39,286
Yukie, is the doctor coming?

1073
01:24:39,287 --> 01:24:41,956
No! He said to bring him in!

1074
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:43,224
In this rain?

1075
01:24:43,225 --> 01:24:45,626
That's why he won't come!

1076
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:46,761
The doctor said that?

1077
01:24:46,762 --> 01:24:48,662
He was just so blunt about it.

1078
01:24:48,663 --> 01:24:49,997
All right. I'll go!

1079
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:52,998
But it's pouring out!

1080
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,472
Wait, dear! I'm coming, too!

1081
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:02,710
Hurry up, then!

1082
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:05,711
Hurry up!

1083
01:25:21,363 --> 01:25:22,797
Stupid boy!

1084
01:25:22,798 --> 01:25:25,798
A proper craftsman
puts his body into it!

1085
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:29,234
You got that?

1086
01:26:40,108 --> 01:26:42,476
FEMALE EMPLOYEE MURDERED
ON WAY HOME

1087
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:44,745
AFTER WORKING OVERTIME

1088
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:47,746
NO EVIDENCE OF ROBBERY

1089
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:50,916
1971

1090
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:56,088
SETO INLAND SEA

1091
01:27:10,405 --> 01:27:13,173
«On the 21st, at about 4:00 p.m.,

1092
01:27:13,174 --> 01:27:16,174
while walking along a road
in Marugame City,

1093
01:27:17,512 --> 01:27:20,512
Nobuyuki Inoue,
a 55-year-old fisherman

1094
01:27:20,815 --> 01:27:23,150
from Rikunohama, Honjima,

1095
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:25,319
MAN BEATEN TO DEATH

1096
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,320
was shoved by a young man
approaching him,

1097
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:31,957
who then proceeded to assault
Inoue until he became unconscious.

1098
01:27:34,062 --> 01:27:37,062
Inoue was taken to a clinic
in Honjima for treatment

1099
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,935
but he never regained
consciousness,

1100
01:27:40,936 --> 01:27:43,936
and he died some two hours later».

1101
01:27:47,342 --> 01:27:48,909
Akeo! Where are you going?

1102
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:51,011
I'm going to kill him!

1103
01:27:51,012 --> 01:27:54,012
Who are you going after?
He was a police officer!

1104
01:27:54,683 --> 01:27:57,683
I'll get someone else!
Then they'll know how I feel!

1105
01:27:58,153 --> 01:27:59,853
You'll be arrested if you do that!

1106
01:27:59,854 --> 01:28:01,689
Hold it! Hold it!

1107
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:03,290
I don't care anymore!

1108
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:06,291
You mustn't!

1109
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:17,803
That boy was never like that.

1110
01:28:18,306 --> 01:28:21,306
He quit working

1111
01:28:21,443 --> 01:28:24,443
and he drinks all day.

1112
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,480
He keeps saying his father
was a fool for getting killed.

1113
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:49,801
AUGUST 1974

1114
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:55,307
KITAKYUSHU CITY

1115
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:16,928
On the 28th, at about 11:00 p.m.,

1116
01:29:17,632 --> 01:29:20,632
near the entrance to Takatoyama Park
in Wakamatsu Ward,

1117
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,470
a man covered in blood
and pleading for help

1118
01:29:25,774 --> 01:29:28,774
was spotted by a resident
of Hatsune, Tobata Ward:

1119
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:32,210
Kazuo Tsurumaki,
a 28-year-old company executive.

1120
01:29:32,213 --> 01:29:34,782
The man was taken to a hospital,

1121
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:37,618
but died shortly afterwards
due to excessive bleeding.

1122
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:40,619
The victim was from Koishi,
Wakamatsu Ward:

1123
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:44,923
Michio Sakuragi,
a 46-year-old taxi driver.

1124
01:29:46,294 --> 01:29:48,462
According to the police investigation,

1125
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:51,463
Sakuragi got into a quarrel with a young
passenger he picked up in Minamae,

1126
01:29:53,568 --> 01:29:55,302
and he was stabbed.

1127
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:58,303
Police are still looking
for the assailant.

1128
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:06,111
CONDOLENCE OFFERING - KAWASE

1129
01:30:24,699 --> 01:30:27,699
So you don't work?
You just run around the country?

1130
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:31,603
That's right.
I think of it as my work.

1131
01:30:33,641 --> 01:30:35,509
How many families have you seen?

1132
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:38,510
Let's see. Maybe around 500.

1133
01:30:39,347 --> 01:30:42,347
No. Probably around 600.

1134
01:30:45,086 --> 01:30:48,086
You should run for office.

1135
01:30:50,925 --> 01:30:53,925
You printed a small article
during the petition drive,

1136
01:30:54,763 --> 01:30:57,763
but nothing since then.

1137
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:01,135
Take a look at this.

1138
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:03,771
He's visited 586 families

1139
01:31:03,772 --> 01:31:05,873
and we have 125 members now.

1140
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:08,874
It's a growing movement.

1141
01:31:09,277 --> 01:31:12,277
I thought we'd see more after you got
transferred to the Tokyo head office.

1142
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:15,415
A newspaper isn't a place where

1143
01:31:15,416 --> 01:31:18,416
I can write whatever I want
and they'll just publish it.

1144
01:31:19,154 --> 01:31:21,054
I know that.

1145
01:31:21,055 --> 01:31:24,055
But a newspaper does more than
just report what goes on in the world.

1146
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:28,362
You also have a duty
to make the world a better place.

1147
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:30,531
We're doing that.

1148
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:33,532
My uncle's over 60 now.

1149
01:31:34,035 --> 01:31:37,035
And he's been at this for seven years.
That's seven years of travelling!

1150
01:31:39,007 --> 01:31:42,007
He'll go anywhere
to meet a suffering family.

1151
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,545
He's not even thinking of himself.

1152
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:47,546
He's pouring everything into this.

1153
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:50,649
Is there no one at this paper
who's moved by such dedication?

1154
01:31:53,121 --> 01:31:56,121
And even though
there are 125 members,

1155
01:31:56,858 --> 01:31:59,858
they're scattered about and linked
only through Shuzo Kawase.

1156
01:32:02,096 --> 01:32:05,096
These people have never met
and don't know each other's names.

1157
01:32:05,266 --> 01:32:07,801
But that's to be expected.

1158
01:32:07,802 --> 01:32:10,802
They don't meet and
there's no published newsletter.

1159
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:15,340
They can't do it.
They don't charge fees, after all.

1160
01:32:16,978 --> 01:32:19,978
Lots of people can't even pay
a 1000-yen annual fee.

1161
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:22,716
What can such an organization do?

1162
01:32:22,717 --> 01:32:25,717
It'll end up being a meaningless group,
and just disappear.

1163
01:32:28,623 --> 01:32:31,091
That would be terrible for my uncle.

1164
01:32:31,092 --> 01:32:33,927
And my aunt, too.

1165
01:32:33,928 --> 01:32:36,928
You even once said
that you were fond of him.

1166
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:40,932
I know.

1167
01:33:34,055 --> 01:33:35,822
Yukie! This is terrible!

1168
01:33:35,823 --> 01:33:37,391
Come here!

1169
01:33:37,392 --> 01:33:39,159
What is it?

1170
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,160
The goldfish are dead!

1171
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:53,238
They were swimming so well
until yesterday.

1172
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:58,510
Takeshi's disappointed.

1173
01:34:00,748 --> 01:34:03,748
He's probably given up hope.

1174
01:34:06,054 --> 01:34:09,054
Given up hope?

1175
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:18,630
Takeshi would be disappointed
if thats how you feel.

1176
01:34:20,468 --> 01:34:23,468
That boy may be laughing at you.

1177
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:30,978
You're just exhausted.

1178
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:33,979
You've been doing a lot of travelling.

1179
01:34:36,284 --> 01:34:39,284
You'll feel better if you rest a bit.

1180
01:34:45,893 --> 01:34:48,893
I'm going to Osaka.

1181
01:34:49,397 --> 01:34:52,397
What did you say?

1182
01:34:52,867 --> 01:34:54,935
I'm going to Osaka.

1183
01:34:54,936 --> 01:34:57,237
There's a new case there.

1184
01:34:57,238 --> 01:34:59,473
I'll go home and get ready.

1185
01:34:59,474 --> 01:35:02,474
But you just got back yesterday.

1186
01:35:02,877 --> 01:35:05,877
It's all right. I don't have much time.

1187
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,250
Then I'll go with you.

1188
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:15,787
You know what can happen.

1189
01:35:17,592 --> 01:35:20,592
It might be like that trip
to Tohoku again.

1190
01:35:22,363 --> 01:35:25,363
That's all right. I don't mind.

1191
01:35:25,967 --> 01:35:28,967
By the way, do we have any money?
I'll borrow it from my sister.

1192
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:37,544
It's the Tenryu River.

1193
01:35:37,545 --> 01:35:40,545
Iida is upstream from here.

1194
01:35:41,082 --> 01:35:44,082
I'll never forget those days.

1195
01:35:44,786 --> 01:35:47,786
Remember when you took me
to the graves?

1196
01:35:50,358 --> 01:35:53,358
That was before Takeshi was born.

1197
01:35:55,029 --> 01:35:58,029
You got back from work
and insisted that we should go.

1198
01:35:58,599 --> 01:36:00,434
Oh, there it is!

1199
01:36:00,435 --> 01:36:03,435
These are my parents' graves.

1200
01:36:04,372 --> 01:36:07,372
You mean these stones?

1201
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:10,542
The little one is my dad
and the big one is my mom.

1202
01:36:11,179 --> 01:36:14,179
Why is your dad's smaller?

1203
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:17,315
Well, he died earlier.

1204
01:36:18,052 --> 01:36:21,052
I wasn't even in elementary school.

1205
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:25,090
My brother took me down
to the Tenryu to pick up the stone.

1206
01:36:28,663 --> 01:36:31,663
I said it was too heavy and
we should drag it with a rope.

1207
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:34,734
My brother gave me hell for that.

1208
01:36:34,735 --> 01:36:37,735
He said we couldn't do that
with our dads gravestone.

1209
01:36:39,107 --> 01:36:42,107
Then I suddenly felt like crying.

1210
01:36:44,245 --> 01:36:47,245
That rock started to feel like Dad.

1211
01:36:48,349 --> 01:36:51,349
I wondered why he had
gotten so small.

1212
01:36:55,223 --> 01:36:58,223
By the time my mother died
I was finishing elementary school.

1213
01:37:02,296 --> 01:37:05,296
So I was able to carry
a bigger stone.

1214
01:37:10,838 --> 01:37:13,838
But the real sadness was to come later.

1215
01:37:16,777 --> 01:37:19,777
We three brothers ended up

1216
01:37:19,947 --> 01:37:22,947
getting adopted separately.

1217
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,720
I was the middle one
and stayed with my uncle in Iida.

1218
01:37:32,727 --> 01:37:35,727
No one would tell me
where my brothers went.

1219
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:43,067
I still don't know where they went.

1220
01:37:51,445 --> 01:37:54,445
It was rough.

1221
01:38:01,055 --> 01:38:04,055
I had to look after my cousins.

1222
01:38:04,992 --> 01:38:07,992
The food I ate and even where I ate
were different from them.

1223
01:38:11,299 --> 01:38:14,299
That was because my parents
died from illness.

1224
01:38:17,238 --> 01:38:20,238
I despised my mother then.

1225
01:38:23,844 --> 01:38:26,844
Why did she die and leave me?

1226
01:38:29,517 --> 01:38:32,517
You can only be a parent
if you're alive.

1227
01:38:36,357 --> 01:38:39,192
Yukie.

1228
01:38:39,193 --> 01:38:42,193
If we ever have kids,

1229
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:45,830
let's make sure

1230
01:38:46,367 --> 01:38:49,367
that we live long for their sake.

1231
01:38:51,172 --> 01:38:53,607
I'm counting on you.

1232
01:38:53,608 --> 01:38:56,608
Our kids will never
have to suffer like that.

1233
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,632
SHIN-OSAKA STATION

1234
01:39:35,383 --> 01:39:38,184
It was mistaken identity.

1235
01:39:38,185 --> 01:39:40,020
A man got into a quarrel in a bar

1236
01:39:40,021 --> 01:39:42,622
and went home to get a shotgun.

1237
01:39:42,623 --> 01:39:44,391
Then he hid and waited

1238
01:39:44,392 --> 01:39:47,392
as my husband, a total stranger to him,
came along.

1239
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:50,561
Now come this way.

1240
01:39:55,036 --> 01:39:58,036
Here.

1241
01:40:02,143 --> 01:40:05,143
Here.

1242
01:40:05,946 --> 01:40:08,946
They caught the assailant
and he's being tried.

1243
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:11,785
But that's all I've heard.

1244
01:40:11,786 --> 01:40:14,254
We're the surviving victims of murder.

1245
01:40:14,255 --> 01:40:16,423
Can you believe it?

1246
01:40:16,424 --> 01:40:18,792
Can that be right?

1247
01:40:18,793 --> 01:40:21,793
On top of that, a psychological
assessment was done,

1248
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:25,396
and they said he had
mental abnormalities.

1249
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:28,700
He might even be judged innocent.

1250
01:40:29,403 --> 01:40:31,938
That's crazy.

1251
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:34,939
Why would someone like that
have a shotgun?

1252
01:40:36,377 --> 01:40:39,377
Who would've given him a permit?
Don't you think?

1253
01:40:39,714 --> 01:40:42,349
Come.

1254
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:45,350
I'm trying to carry on my
husband's business, but it's hard.

1255
01:40:48,289 --> 01:40:51,289
It sounds rough.

1256
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:54,627
Just raising my kids

1257
01:40:54,628 --> 01:40:57,628
and seeing my husband's face
every day was all I wanted.

1258
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,300
There was nothing more I wanted.

1259
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:05,336
I always felt that was enough.

1260
01:41:06,841 --> 01:41:09,841
But I can't let this situation stand.

1261
01:41:10,311 --> 01:41:13,311
I'm claiming damages from the national
and prefectural governments.

1262
01:41:15,616 --> 01:41:18,151
I didn't really want to at first.

1263
01:41:18,152 --> 01:41:21,152
No amount of money would
bring my husband back.

1264
01:41:22,123 --> 01:41:25,123
It would've been like bartering
my husband's life for money.

1265
01:41:26,994 --> 01:41:29,362
What changed your mind?

1266
01:41:29,363 --> 01:41:32,363
I began to think of it as a duty.

1267
01:41:33,267 --> 01:41:34,267
A duty?

1268
01:41:34,268 --> 01:41:37,268
It was like Professor Nakaya said.

1269
01:41:37,838 --> 01:41:40,838
A victim's family has a natural right
to compensation.

1270
01:41:42,143 --> 01:41:45,143
Those people who can
should demand it.

1271
01:41:45,646 --> 01:41:48,415
There are people everywhere
with a similar fate

1272
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:51,416
who are just grieving
and doing nothing else.

1273
01:41:51,585 --> 01:41:53,820
We have a duty to those people.

1274
01:41:53,821 --> 01:41:56,821
Who is this Professor Nakaya?

1275
01:41:57,625 --> 01:41:59,859
- Don't you know?
- No.

1276
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:02,762
He teaches at Doshisha University
in Kyoto.

1277
01:42:02,763 --> 01:42:05,763
Last year he set up an association for
a compensation system for crime victims.

1278
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:10,937
I didn't know
there was anyone like that.

1279
01:42:10,938 --> 01:42:13,938
I suppose a family member of his
was a victim of crime?

1280
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:16,376
Actually, no.

1281
01:42:16,377 --> 01:42:19,377
He teaches in the law department,
and that's his research.

1282
01:42:21,282 --> 01:42:24,217
He's even studied in England.

1283
01:42:24,218 --> 01:42:27,218
And he says the victim's families
have a right to compensation?

1284
01:42:29,256 --> 01:42:31,057
That's right.

1285
01:42:31,058 --> 01:42:34,058
He says some encouraging things.

1286
01:42:38,432 --> 01:42:41,432
DOSHISHA UNIVERSITY

1287
01:42:42,703 --> 01:42:45,672
I certainly am surprised.

1288
01:42:45,673 --> 01:42:48,274
To think someone had been
leading the way.

1289
01:42:48,275 --> 01:42:51,275
If I'd known,
I would've sought you out.

1290
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:56,380
So you have 150 people.

1291
01:42:56,417 --> 01:42:59,417
No, it's 155.

1292
01:43:00,855 --> 01:43:03,855
I see.

1293
01:43:04,091 --> 01:43:07,091
Last fall I started a group
with just four members.

1294
01:43:09,296 --> 01:43:12,296
Even now, there are only 20 or 30.

1295
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:15,468
I tried to recruit many more,

1296
01:43:15,469 --> 01:43:17,704
but they were all holed up
in their homes.

1297
01:43:17,705 --> 01:43:20,705
A lot of people told me
to just leave them alone.

1298
01:43:22,109 --> 01:43:25,109
So I can appreciate the trouble
you've gone through.

1299
01:43:27,081 --> 01:43:28,381
It must've been hard work.

1300
01:43:28,382 --> 01:43:30,850
Yes.

1301
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:33,851
Indeed.

1302
01:43:34,588 --> 01:43:37,588
Having taken it that far
is no small task.

1303
01:43:39,627 --> 01:43:42,627
You have my respect.

1304
01:43:52,907 --> 01:43:55,907
I see.

1305
01:43:56,143 --> 01:43:59,143
Now, to continue -
As I mentioned,

1306
01:44:00,881 --> 01:44:03,616
when protecting your rights
and freedoms,

1307
01:44:03,617 --> 01:44:06,617
it's unfortunately more difficult
to prevent crimes.

1308
01:44:07,888 --> 01:44:10,888
And we'll likely see more crimes
as the world gets more complicated.

1309
01:44:13,227 --> 01:44:16,227
These are times when you never know
when tragedy will befall you.

1310
01:44:18,999 --> 01:44:21,167
In fact, taking my group
as an example,

1311
01:44:21,168 --> 01:44:24,168
all of the victims were
completely blameless.

1312
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:26,673
According to statistics
from the year before,

1313
01:44:26,674 --> 01:44:29,674
this was the case
with over 30% of murders.

1314
01:44:30,945 --> 01:44:33,945
So one-in-three murder victims
were killed for no reason at all.

1315
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:39,550
As far as that goes, I believe
such crimes are inherent in society.

1316
01:44:42,156 --> 01:44:45,156
In a way,
they're like endemic diseases.

1317
01:44:46,627 --> 01:44:48,828
Endemic diseases?

1318
01:44:48,829 --> 01:44:51,829
Diseases you cannot eradicate
no matter what you do.

1319
01:44:51,832 --> 01:44:54,567
I think you have to think of it that way.

1320
01:44:54,568 --> 01:44:57,568
That's why I think we should be
protected at all times

1321
01:44:59,173 --> 01:45:02,173
through some insurance that pays
under any circumstances.

1322
01:45:03,611 --> 01:45:06,611
I think thats the only way
to deal with it.

1323
01:45:06,947 --> 01:45:09,947
Did you say insurance?

1324
01:45:11,452 --> 01:45:12,552
Yes.

1325
01:45:12,553 --> 01:45:14,954
What do you mean?

1326
01:45:14,955 --> 01:45:17,590
Not something you need
to get a policy for.

1327
01:45:17,591 --> 01:45:20,591
I believe all citizens
are part of that contract.

1328
01:45:20,894 --> 01:45:23,894
The premiums take the form of taxes.

1329
01:45:25,432 --> 01:45:28,432
Of course, there are many obstacles.

1330
01:45:28,535 --> 01:45:31,535
But the state ought to pay
compensation to the victims.

1331
01:45:33,273 --> 01:45:36,273
That's how I see it.

1332
01:45:38,879 --> 01:45:41,781
I wish we had heard this earlier.

1333
01:45:41,782 --> 01:45:44,782
We only wanted to help people
who were suffering.

1334
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:48,855
It was about asking for help.

1335
01:45:48,856 --> 01:45:51,856
Not at all.
You've done splendidly.

1336
01:45:53,594 --> 01:45:56,594
You've worked so hard for so long.

1337
01:45:58,298 --> 01:46:01,298
You're to be commended.

1338
01:46:01,335 --> 01:46:03,603
Please be confident.

1339
01:46:03,604 --> 01:46:06,604
In Europe and the States,
and even in Asia,

1340
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,640
laws have already been enacted
to insure the people.

1341
01:46:11,578 --> 01:46:14,280
There's no reason
it can't happen in Japan.

1342
01:46:14,281 --> 01:46:17,281
Lets join together
and work toward our objective.

1343
01:46:20,621 --> 01:46:23,621
Thank you.

1344
01:46:24,625 --> 01:46:27,625
You've given me
the courage to continue.

1345

SHIN-YOKOHAMA STATION

1346
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:53,350
Slow down, dear.

1347
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:56,420
We have to hurry and tell everyone.

1348
01:47:04,698 --> 01:47:07,698
Are you all right? I warned you!

1349
01:47:08,869 --> 01:47:10,570
Are you all right?

1350
01:47:10,571 --> 01:47:13,571
It's nothing serious.

1351
01:47:25,352 --> 01:47:28,352
This way, dear.

1352
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:35,860
OPHTHALMOLOGY

1353
01:47:42,436 --> 01:47:45,436
Glaucoma, huh?

1354
01:47:46,406 --> 01:47:49,406
I'm glad he was straight with me.

1355
01:47:49,409 --> 01:47:52,409
A good doctor.

1356
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:56,680
If theres no cure,
then that keeps it simple.

1357
01:47:59,319 --> 01:48:02,319
We won't be bothered
with going to the hospital.

1358
01:48:06,493 --> 01:48:09,262
I'm resigned to this.

1359
01:48:09,263 --> 01:48:12,263
But I won't give up on the campaign,
with or without my eyes.

1360
01:48:15,803 --> 01:48:18,803
Yukie.

1361
01:48:20,107 --> 01:48:23,107
We're in a critical period right now.

1362
01:48:23,143 --> 01:48:26,143
You'll have to take my hand
and guide me.

1363
01:48:27,748 --> 01:48:29,816
That's all right.

1364
01:48:29,817 --> 01:48:32,817
I'll go with you everywhere.

1365
01:48:43,096 --> 01:48:44,964
AUGUST 30, 1974

1366
01:48:44,965 --> 01:48:47,533
This afternoon in Marunouchi, Tokyo,

1367
01:48:47,534 --> 01:48:50,534
in the lobby of the headquarters
of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,

1368
01:48:50,904 --> 01:48:53,904
a bomb planted
by a young man went off

1369
01:48:54,675 --> 01:48:57,675
Six people were killed, including
pedestrians and office workers on break.

1370
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:03,380
Over 100 people suffered serious
injuries in this major disaster.

1371
01:49:06,553 --> 01:49:09,155
The police agency
and Marunouchi precinct

1372
01:49:09,156 --> 01:49:11,657
are considering it a planned assault,

1373
01:49:11,658 --> 01:49:14,658
on the basis of a bomb warning

1374
01:49:15,162 --> 01:49:18,162
phoned into the office
by a young man,

1375
01:49:19,633 --> 01:49:22,633
and the fact that bomb fragments found
at the scene suggest a timer device.

1376
01:49:25,138 --> 01:49:28,138
It is thought to be the work of radicals
as police start to pursue this case.

1377
01:49:31,979 --> 01:49:34,979
The explosion occurred
just at the end of the lunch break

1378
01:49:36,817 --> 01:49:39,817
when office workers were returning
to their offices.

1379
01:49:40,487 --> 01:49:43,487
Many took the brunt of the explosion
and fell to the ground,

1380
01:49:44,892 --> 01:49:47,892
and this street in Marunouchi was
instantly turned into a scene from hell.

1381
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:56,700
Let's visit them all. Take me!

1382
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:59,138
Yes. We should go.

1389
01:50:17,324 --> 01:50:20,324
You don't like it?

1390
01:50:20,494 --> 01:50:23,494
It's only because a big company
was hit and a lot of people died.

1391
01:50:25,666 --> 01:50:27,867
That's what it takes
to get people to notice.

1392
01:50:27,868 --> 01:50:30,836
That's exactly right. So what?

1393
01:50:30,837 --> 01:50:33,837
It makes me angry.
You sure took your time.

1394
01:50:35,142 --> 01:50:38,142
Now that it's a big deal
you don't look the other way.

1395
01:50:39,513 --> 01:50:42,513
- Don't be so petty.
- Who's being petty?

1396
01:50:42,549 --> 01:50:45,549
This is how the world has always been.

1397
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:49,820
He certainly knows that.

1398
01:50:50,223 --> 01:50:52,358
He may have his doubts,

1399
01:50:52,359 --> 01:50:55,359
but he doesn't show it.

1400
01:50:55,662 --> 01:50:58,662
He wants to use this opportunity
to make an impact. That's all.

1401
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
He's doing all he can
in spite of his condition.

1402
01:51:04,304 --> 01:51:05,805
I know that much.

01:51:08,308 --> 01:51:11,243
CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION
SYSTEM

1405
01:51:11,244 --> 01:51:13,546
Please file in from the top.

1406
01:51:13,547 --> 01:51:16,547
Good morning.
Please come this way.

1407
01:51:18,051 --> 01:51:19,185
Thank you for coming.

1408
01:51:19,186 --> 01:51:20,453
Watch your footing.

1409
01:51:20,454 --> 01:51:23,454
Be careful.

1410
01:51:36,636 --> 01:51:39,636
Mr. Suzuki -

1411
01:51:40,741 --> 01:51:43,741
Good morning.
Over this way. Please.

1412
01:51:44,778 --> 01:51:46,579
Are you all right?
Right here, Madam.

1413
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:48,147
- Thank you.
- Please sit down.

1414
01:51:48,148 --> 01:51:51,148
These are the Kawases.

1415
01:51:51,518 --> 01:51:53,552
Please have a seat, Madam.

1416
01:51:53,553 --> 01:51:56,553
Mr. Kawase, this segment
will be about 12 to 13 minutes.

1417
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:00,626
Only 12 to 13 minutes?

1418
01:52:00,627 --> 01:52:03,262
We have other segments as well.

1419
01:52:03,263 --> 01:52:05,765
- Yes, I understand.
- Thank you.

1420
01:52:05,766 --> 01:52:08,766
I have some arrangements to make.
Please make yourself comfortable.

1421
01:52:15,575 --> 01:52:17,810
We're not the only ones here.

1422
01:52:17,811 --> 01:52:20,811
I know.
I'll just keep it concise.

1423
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:28,252
STATE COMPENSATION DEMANDED
FOR FAMILIES OF CRIME VICTIMS

1424
01:52:33,627 --> 01:52:36,627
BEREAVED FAMILIES WILL
NO LONGER SUFFER SILENTLY

1425
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:43,300
KANTO KOSHINETSU ASSOCIATION

1426
01:53:24,211 --> 01:53:27,211
POSSIBLE LEGISLATION TO OFFER
COMPENSATION FOR CRIME VICTIMS

1427
01:53:28,048 --> 01:53:30,683
MINISTER OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCES

1428
01:53:30,684 --> 01:53:33,684
JULY 2, 1976

1429
01:54:18,598 --> 01:54:21,598
Are we near the Diet Building?

1430
01:54:21,735 --> 01:54:24,735
We're just at the back of it.

1431
01:54:25,405 --> 01:54:28,405
The entrance is right here.

1432
01:54:30,143 --> 01:54:32,945
Finally...

1433
01:54:32,946 --> 01:54:35,946
Pardon?

1434
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:39,149
Finally, we plunge into the den of lions.

1435
01:54:40,253 --> 01:54:43,253
It really feels like that.

1436
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:47,459
It's been a long road.

1437
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:50,460
And we've finally arrived.

1438
01:55:01,841 --> 01:55:04,841
Careful.

1439
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:09,481
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL AFFAIRS

1440
01:55:09,482 --> 01:55:12,482
With respect to this legislation,

1441
01:55:12,686 --> 01:55:15,686
the most difficult challenge
is how to deal with

1442
01:55:17,557 --> 01:55:20,557
the victims of past crimes.

1443
01:55:21,394 --> 01:55:23,495
If this law is only intended
to help people

1444
01:55:23,496 --> 01:55:26,496
that are victims of crime
committed in the future,

1445
01:55:27,334 --> 01:55:30,334
we will not have addressed the many
problems faced by those people.

1446
01:55:33,006 --> 01:55:36,006
To express his views on this point
I would like to call upon

1447
01:55:37,177 --> 01:55:40,177
Mr. Shuzo Kawase, who has continued
to lead this campaign.

1448
01:55:43,984 --> 01:55:46,485
Mr. Shuzo Kawase.

1449
01:55:46,486 --> 01:55:49,486
Yes.

1450
01:56:02,068 --> 01:56:05,068
After hearing what
the honourable members have said -

1451
01:56:09,776 --> 01:56:12,776
I don't really understand
some of the complicated issues.

1452
01:56:15,315 --> 01:56:18,315
But as the honourable member
has said,

1453
01:56:18,752 --> 01:56:21,752
I have continued to pursue
this campaign for eight years.

1454
01:56:28,128 --> 01:56:30,529
I don't know how to put this,

1455
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:33,530
but it's been a worthwhile effort.
For example,

1456
01:56:35,602 --> 01:56:38,602
when I visited the home of a victim,

1457
01:56:39,272 --> 01:56:42,074
just as I offered some incense,

1458
01:56:42,075 --> 01:56:45,075
the young widow held a wooden
mortuary tablet

1459
01:56:45,912 --> 01:56:48,912
tightly to her chest

1460
01:56:49,182 --> 01:56:52,182
and said, «Why did you die, dear?

1461
01:56:54,888 --> 01:56:57,888
Why did you die
at the young age of 30?

1462
01:57:00,927 --> 01:57:03,927
Because you were killed,

1463
01:57:04,631 --> 01:57:07,631
there's no money coming in at all.

1464
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:13,970
If you had died in a car accident

1465
01:57:15,308 --> 01:57:17,343
or a workplace accident,

1466
01:57:17,344 --> 01:57:20,344
I would've been able to
receive some money.

1467
01:57:21,915 --> 01:57:24,915
I would've been able to support
our child for two or three years.

1468
01:57:26,753 --> 01:57:29,753
I could've raised him properly

1469
01:57:29,789 --> 01:57:32,789
until he was old enough.

1470
01:57:35,962 --> 01:57:38,630
But because you were murdered

1471
01:57:38,631 --> 01:57:41,631
I get no money from anywhere.

1472
01:57:42,202 --> 01:57:45,202
What am I supposed to do now?»

1473
01:57:47,707 --> 01:57:50,707
When I heard her anguished pleas,

1474
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:53,810
I became determined to push
for a compensation system

1475
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:57,080
to be enacted into law
as soon as possible.

1476
01:58:00,353 --> 01:58:03,353
I have been working towards that aim
even as my eyesight has deteriorated.

1477
01:58:08,027 --> 01:58:11,027
I was practically away from home
for six years.

1478
01:58:12,065 --> 01:58:15,065
I visited the families of victims across the country.

1479
01:58:19,572 --> 01:58:22,572
In some cases,
they thought I just wanted money

1480
01:58:24,778 --> 01:58:27,513
and they would turn me away
at the door.

1481
01:58:27,514 --> 01:58:30,514
I've had many experiences,

1482
01:58:31,785 --> 01:58:34,019
and have met all kinds of people.

1483
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:37,020
I've seen a lot of families suffering.

1484
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:42,359
And so it is my desire

1485
01:58:42,762 --> 01:58:45,762
that a system like this
be adopted as soon as possible.

1486
01:58:45,965 --> 01:58:48,965
And I understand
that ordinary legislation

1487
01:58:50,203 --> 01:58:53,203
is not retroactive as a general rule.

1488
01:58:54,073 --> 01:58:57,073
But my wish is that this law apply
to cases going back 10 or 15 years,

1489
01:59:01,915 --> 01:59:04,915
so that long-suffering families
can get the help they need.

1490
01:59:11,925 --> 01:59:13,425
You must be exhausted.

1491
01:59:13,426 --> 01:59:15,260
Yeah.

1492
01:59:15,261 --> 01:59:18,261
What a nerve-racking experience.

1493
01:59:18,898 --> 01:59:21,767
You did great.

1494
01:59:21,768 --> 01:59:24,768
A simple metal shop owner

1495
01:59:26,406 --> 01:59:29,406
who doesn't have a way with words,
finds the words come rambling out.

1496
01:59:32,245 --> 01:59:34,379
Don't worry about that.

1497
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:37,380
They didn't call on you to talk
about law like the professor.

1498
01:59:41,454 --> 01:59:44,454
Is something the matter, dear?

1499
01:59:45,925 --> 01:59:48,494
I'm fine.

1500
01:59:48,495 --> 01:59:51,495
Dear? Dear!

1501
01:59:54,534 --> 01:59:57,534
JANUARY 1977

1502
02:00:10,483 --> 02:00:13,483
«In order to consider
retroactive legislation,

1503
02:00:13,486 --> 02:00:16,486
various budgetary obstacles
can be expected.

1504
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:20,290
But public opinion in favour of
enacting the law is mounting,

1505
02:00:20,994 --> 02:00:23,994
as it is clearly aimed at people
who have suffered from crimes.

1506
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:27,330
A campaign started by a small
band of citizens has grown in scope,

1507
02:00:30,069 --> 02:00:33,069
proving significant in the continual
development of democracy».

1508
02:00:36,843 --> 02:00:38,076
Are you listening?

1509
02:00:38,077 --> 02:00:41,077
I am listening.

1510
02:00:42,215 --> 02:00:45,215
Anyway, there you go.

1511
02:00:45,518 --> 02:00:48,518
They're seriously considering
the issue of making it retroactive.

1512
02:00:50,757 --> 02:00:53,757
Isn't that what it says?

1513
02:00:54,894 --> 02:00:56,929
There's more. Shall I keep reading?

1514
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:59,930
Read me all of it.

1515
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:11,041
Let's see. Where was it?

1516
02:01:11,511 --> 02:01:14,079
It's all over the place now.

1517
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:17,080
It's like everyone
wants to write about it now.

1518
02:01:18,518 --> 02:01:21,518
Come on. Just read it.

1519
02:01:22,322 --> 02:01:25,322
I'm just looking for it.

1520
02:01:25,458 --> 02:01:28,458
Here. Here it is.

1521
02:01:28,561 --> 02:01:31,561
«The Price of Life -
On the value of victim compensation»

1522
02:01:34,033 --> 02:01:37,033
The price of life, huh?

1523
02:01:45,745 --> 02:01:48,745
He's weakened considerably
since appearing before the committee.

1524
02:01:50,516 --> 02:01:53,516
But he still insists on attending
the meetings.

1525
02:01:55,221 --> 02:01:58,221
Stubborn as he is,
he's starting to take my advice.

1526
02:02:00,893 --> 02:02:03,893
This is the same hospital
your son was brought to.

1527
02:02:03,896 --> 02:02:06,896
That's right. The same hospital.

1528
02:02:08,234 --> 02:02:11,234
He said this is where
he wanted to be.

1529
02:02:12,505 --> 02:02:15,505
I guess it's been 10 years.

1530
02:02:29,122 --> 02:02:32,122
Where were you, Auntie?
Hurry! Hurry!

1531
02:02:41,968 --> 02:02:43,902
Yukie -

1532
02:02:43,903 --> 02:02:46,903
Yes.

1533
02:02:49,108 --> 02:02:52,108
What is it?

1534
02:02:58,718 --> 02:03:01,718
Get ready.

1535
02:03:02,755 --> 02:03:05,724
Get ready for what?

1536
02:03:05,725 --> 02:03:07,259
We're going out.

1537
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:10,260
Where are you going, Uncle?

1538
02:03:10,563 --> 02:03:13,563
Coca Cola.

1539
02:03:14,634 --> 02:03:17,634
The one that died because...

1540
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:24,140
there was cyanide in it.

1541
02:03:27,313 --> 02:03:30,313
Who would do such a thing?

1542
02:03:32,285 --> 02:03:35,285
Killing an innocent person.

1543
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:42,694
Is there a doctor?

1544
02:03:42,695 --> 02:03:45,695
Yes. Right here.

1545
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:50,200
I have a request.

1546
02:03:51,838 --> 02:03:53,972
Two more years.

1547
02:03:53,973 --> 02:03:55,941
Why?

1548
02:03:55,942 --> 02:03:58,942
Why?

1549
02:04:03,683 --> 02:04:06,683
For just two more years -

1550
02:04:12,358 --> 02:04:14,893
Why two years?

1551
02:04:14,894 --> 02:04:17,429
Please let me live.

1552
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:20,430
You'll be all right. Not to worry.

1553
02:04:22,268 --> 02:04:25,268
In two years -

1554
02:04:26,973 --> 02:04:29,973
I think in two years...

1555
02:04:31,444 --> 02:04:34,444
they'll enact a law.

1556
02:04:37,683 --> 02:04:40,683
I can't go see my son...

1557
02:04:41,254 --> 02:04:44,254
until I witness that.

1558
02:04:45,925 --> 02:04:48,925
I'm begging you.

1559
02:04:50,630 --> 02:04:53,630
Two more years.

1560
02:04:56,369 --> 02:04:59,369
Doctor!

1561
02:04:59,906 --> 02:05:02,307
No!

1562
02:05:02,308 --> 02:05:05,143
No!

1563
02:05:05,144 --> 02:05:08,144
What're we going to do,
Mr. Matsuzaki?

1564
02:05:08,514 --> 02:05:11,514
How can fate be so cruel
to my aunt and uncle?

1565
02:05:26,132 --> 02:05:29,132
I'll phone the paper.

1566
02:05:35,942 --> 02:05:38,942
I will do it.

1567
02:05:40,112 --> 02:05:43,112
I will carry on the work

1568
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:46,950
that you wanted to finish.

1569
02:05:53,593 --> 02:05:56,593
Mr. Kawase just passed away.

1570
02:05:57,530 --> 02:06:00,530
Mr. Kawase of the campaign
to get compensation for crime victims.

1571
02:06:02,635 --> 02:06:05,635
Yes. His heart gave out
from overwork.

1572
02:06:08,507 --> 02:06:11,507
«A Great Citizen Passes On».
That's the story.

1573
02:06:13,546 --> 02:06:16,546
I'll send it in 10 minutes.
The lead for the evening edition.

1574
02:06:18,184 --> 02:06:21,184
I know it's tight,
but I'll make it in time. Thanks.

1575
02:06:22,321 --> 02:06:25,321
Mr. Matsuzaki, you must know -

1576
02:06:26,692 --> 02:06:28,326
What?

1577
02:06:28,327 --> 02:06:30,862
The murderer that killed Takeshi

1578
02:06:30,863 --> 02:06:33,863
is already out
and walking freely amongst us.

1579
02:06:37,236 --> 02:06:40,005
Probably.

1580
02:06:40,006 --> 02:06:42,007
Not probably.

1581
02:06:42,008 --> 02:06:44,142
It's certain.

1582
02:06:44,143 --> 02:06:47,143
At least five years
but no more than 10.

1583
02:06:47,747 --> 02:06:50,747
Even if he got the maximum,

1584
02:06:50,983 --> 02:06:53,983
he'd already be out in the world.

1585
02:06:56,355 --> 02:06:59,355
What's 10 years?

1586
02:06:59,492 --> 02:07:02,492
Does that allow him to wash away
his crime and start over?

1587
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:10,300
Uncle -

1588
02:07:10,736 --> 02:07:13,736
I can't imagine how hard Uncle
worked over these past 10 years.

1589
02:07:16,075 --> 02:07:19,075
Even with his eyesight gone,

1590
02:07:19,478 --> 02:07:22,013
he'd be walking about.

1591
02:07:22,014 --> 02:07:25,014
And now he's finally dead.

1592
02:07:28,921 --> 02:07:31,921
What did he get for that effort?

1593
02:07:34,493 --> 02:07:37,493
No money left, and no one to turn to.

1594
02:07:44,470 --> 02:07:47,470
In the end,
my aunt just gets left behind.

1595
02:07:51,444 --> 02:07:54,444
How do their 10 years compare
with the murderer's 10 years?

1596
02:07:58,217 --> 02:08:01,217
I understand how you feel.

1597
02:08:01,954 --> 02:08:04,756
It's not about how I feel.

1598
02:08:04,757 --> 02:08:07,757
It's about how my aunt and uncle feel.

1599
02:08:07,793 --> 02:08:10,793
It's about how victims
across the country feel.

1600
02:08:49,802 --> 02:08:52,802
In June of 1979,

1601
02:08:53,973 --> 02:08:56,973
the government drafted a bill
to pay compensation

1602
02:09:00,546 --> 02:09:03,546
up to a maximum
of 8.6 million yen.

1603
02:09:06,685 --> 02:09:09,685
However, this draft bill

1604
02:09:11,824 --> 02:09:14,824
did not have provisions
for retroactivity

1605
02:09:19,265 --> 02:09:22,265
and has yet to be introduced
in parliament.
