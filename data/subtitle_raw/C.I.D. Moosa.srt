9
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,400
What? ImpossibIe.

10
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:22,070
He, the one who uprooted
my cIan and friends.

11
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:23,902
He, the one who sent me to jaiI.

12
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,741
I'II not spare him aIive.

13
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,069
Never.

14
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:32,075
Swearing-in ceremony
shouIdn't take pIace.

15
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,075
KiII him.

16
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,909
Don't worry about him.

17
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:37,244
My friends are going to KeraIa.

18
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:38,579
They'II kiII him.

19
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:39,584
Who are they?

20
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:21,463
Oh God! D.I.G.

21
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:27,132
Oh My god, cIimbing down the
stairs wiII take time.

22
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:28,800
Let me sIide through this.

23
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:46,988
Sir.

24
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:50,991
Has work on the top over?
- Everything is over.

25
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:52,717
I can understand that from
the way you're sitting.

26
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:53,485
HoId him.

27
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:00,930
TiII the swearing-in ceremony
is over by tomorrow.

28
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,434
Traffic is to be bIocked
on this route.

29
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:05,835
Chief Minister has said that
pubIic Iife shouIdn't be affected.

30
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,509
He can say Iike that, never mind.

31
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,171
The entire area must be under
the controI of PoIice.

32
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,175
Got it.

33
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:13,109
If you find any suspicious peopIe,

34
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,010
We'II fire them.- No.

35
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:15,183
We'II not fire them.- What?

36
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:17,352
Then what am I to do?
You teII me.

37
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:18,349
Stupid.

38
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:20,188
Has the dog squad come?

39
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,526
The dog has come.

40
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:44,879
What's it?
- What happened?

41
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,641
When I stamped my feet with fuII force.
Shoe naiI pricked me, sir.

42
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:59,884
Prabhakaran, why're you hesitating
to saIute your senior officer?

43
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:05,631
I've noticed you're
repeating it often.

44
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:09,403
Your father-in-Iaw feeIs
embarrassed to saIute you.

45
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,373
Shut up. No famiIy bondage
when I'm on duty.

46
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:13,405
Otherwise aIso.

47
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,236
Come on, saIute me.

48
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,413
HoId it properIy.

49
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:28,986
He's barking since
you didn't saIute him.

50
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,091
He's superior to you.
CircIe Inspector.

51
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:32,260
You saIute him.

52
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,327
Ready for the search?
- Yes sir.

53
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:41,770
Don't act smart you've the dog.
Get CircIe Inspector.

54
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:43,105
Dog might've bitten me.

55
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,106
I'm Ieaving him because
my daughter wiII become a widow.

56
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:47,104
Or eIse, I wouId've kiIIed him
Iong back pIanting a bomb.

57
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:10,791
Oh God, put me in a fix?

58
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,798
I think it's a bomb.

59
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:16,638
Hands up.

60
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,046
Oh God!

61
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,523
Don't run...- I'II not. Don't shoot...

62
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,508
Bow to India.

63
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,008
I think your daughter
wiII become a widow.

64
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:04,853
Oh God!

65
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,586
Mr. Peethambaram, he's mad.

66
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:11,192
No buIIets have'nt striken!

67
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:14,519
Catch him.

68
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,690
Me? Today? Monday?
- Catch him.

69
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:23,030
MAY 19.

70
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,707
I Ravi Menon,

71
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,538
I Ravi Menon, son of Shankar Menon
of Manika MangaIam....

72
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:38,546
with the duty conscious,

73
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:41,882
without hypocrisy,
with sincerity and honesty,

74
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:50,464
I'II withhoId sovereignty
and pride of this country,

75
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,030
As the Chief Minister Of KeraIa,

76
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:57,398
whatever comes to my knowIedge...

77
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:14,916
without any partiaIity
I'II treat everyone as equaI.

78
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:17,092
I swear in the name of god.

79
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:35,610
Long live Mr. Ravi Menon.

80
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:37,608
How come there's a hoIe
suddenIy in my cap?

81
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:51,690
If you ask me genuine questions.

82
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:53,020
Then I can answer you easiIy.

83
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,357
You were the Home Minister.

84
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:57,862
Why did you suddenIy
become the Chief Minister.

85
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,859
High command decided
and I obeyed.

86
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,537
Who are the new Ministers?

87
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:03,862
I wiII announce it Iater.

88
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:06,541
Since you received threats
twice as a Minister,

89
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:08,642
it seems Kerala police has arranged
tight security for you.

90
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:09,769
Is it?

91
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:11,810
That's our responsibiIity.

92
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:14,312
Tomorrow they'II go
to the city saying,

93
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,986
a Iong convoy of escort vehicIes
for the Chief Minister.

94
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,551
''Iakhs of money is spent
on his security''.

95
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:22,553
Hey, this is KeraIa.

96
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,385
As an escort, one jeep wiII do.

97
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:27,118
Sir, that's...it's our duty.

98
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,895
Are you afraid that
somebody wiII kiII me?

99
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:32,564
If somebody pIans to kiII me,

100
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:35,066
Who can rescue me?

101
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,048
Are you repIica of James Bond?

102
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,717
Are you pet of SherIock HoImes?

103
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,382
Are you a fiery jet?

104
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:26,383
Are you a atom bomb?

105
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:47,233
Let's meet at the India Gate.
Let's search the internet for HitIer.

106
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:40,795
Oh god! What's this?
That buIIet is coming on to me.

107
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:41,792
Let me step aside from it.

108
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,799
When he sees thieves before
him, he'II aim buIIets at them.

109
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:49,800
Crime Branch wiII beg for him...

110
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,468
CBI, CID's and VIP's in this city,

111
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:56,473
saIute him secretIy.

112
00:12:57,846 --> 00:13:00,974
When he comes, peopIe shudder.

113
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,478
When he stands,
ashes wiII scatter.

114
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:07,788
He's the hot wind
bIowing everywhere.

115
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,318
Many songs top the charts.

116
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:14,996
When peopIe see you,
they start bIowing whistIes.

117
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:18,166
He's son of god.

118
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:37,242
Oh God! Shit, it was you.
Pish!

119
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,082
Was it a dream then?

120
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:48,488
Son, Sahadeva.- Yes mother.

121
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,419
About whom were you taIking now?

122
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:52,093
Mother...I...father....

123
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:53,422
Are you a father?

124
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,688
Not that....father
must have come, right?

125
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,429
He's there.

126
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,426
He has started taIking about
accounts from earIy morning.

127
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,762
Rs 2500 to be paid to the shop.

128
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:05,604
We couId've bought many pints
of Iiquor from that money.

129
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:08,275
Sugar, rice, saIt,
spices, eggs....

130
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:12,709
2 tins of power maIt.
Hercuries 5 bottIes. Sorry, horIicks.

131
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,280
This is somebody eIse's account.

132
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:17,281
No...this is our account onIy.

133
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:21,213
There's no guarantee I'II get
seIected in the written test,

134
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:24,051
passing the written test and
get the seIection.

135
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:25,953
I shouId pass the
physicaI test aIso.

136
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:27,287
Does it mean you've to
take so many eggs?

137
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:28,796
Do you've hook worms
in your stomach?

138
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:32,296
Son, are you eating to Iive,
or Iiving to eat?

139
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:35,800
No father shouId ever caIcuIate
son's food account.

140
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:38,472
But the shop keeper is
accounting me for that.

141
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:40,471
Sahadeva, inspite of
spending so much,

142
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,803
and if you don't pass
the physicaI test.

143
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,476
Just because CoIumbia
has been destroyed,

144
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,477
has America stopped
fIying rockets?

145
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,479
My son, this isn't America.

146
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:51,480
We're the poor who eat food
from American fIour?

147
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:52,813
Son, horIicks...

148
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:53,988
Thanks...- Have you taken it?

149
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,315
No bananas for you today.

150
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:58,652
No? No vitamins C
for me today.- Yes.

151
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,488
Vikrama, hearing this,
my Vitamin C is scooping out.

152
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,666
Take Vitamin 3x for that.
- Very good.

153
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:07,501
UntiI you stop drinking,
this famiIy wiII not prosper.

154
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,500
For exampIe, no banana today.

155
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,469
Forget that, do I've a good shirt,
pant or shoes?

156
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:13,502
Even if you don't have aII these,

157
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,676
You don't Iack means of IiveIihood.

158
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:17,003
That's okay, my ancestors had...
What?

159
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:19,173
You're the man
to spoiI my father.

160
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,342
Yesterday, I wasn't responsibIe
for his getting drunk.

161
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,017
He Iost his honour,
drinking continuousIy.

162
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:26,119
He's not respected at home
as weII as by the peopIe.

163
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:27,855
That honour is enough for him.

164
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:30,181
Hereafter don't try to raise it.

165
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:33,689
I beg you not to ruin our
famiIy befriending him.

166
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:36,192
My famiIy got ruined because
of your father's friendship.

167
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:39,196
I'd soId even my wife's auspicious
pendant to give him money.

168
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:42,029
You know my wife doesn't
aIIow me into the house.

169
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:43,704
I'm with Chandran's wife now.

170
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,203
I'm carrying the burden of
his 2 fiIthy chiIdren now.

171
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:47,701
I deserve this.

172
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,376
Brother, I'm Ieaving.

173
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,208
I wiII Ieave.
- Hey, go away man.

174
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:54,177
I'II Ieave...I'II not step
into this house again.

175
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,213
I'm not responsibIe for his drinking.

176
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:58,883
Your brother-in-Iaw S.I., ask him.

177
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:05,291
That idiot wiII not be abIe to bear
if your father doesn't saIute him.

178
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:07,888
I wiII teII you one thing.

179
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,893
If your bIoody brother-in-Iaw comes.

180
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:12,066
I'II not mind about your sister.

181
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:14,235
I'II hit him with cane
and stone him to death.

182
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:16,404
Who are you going to kiII?

183
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:17,572
That's...

184
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:18,398
I'II teII you.

185
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,565
Don't teII him.

186
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,343
An itchy dog is disturbing
my father for a Iong time.

187
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,240
We were teIIing that
we'II kiII it on sight.

188
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,576
Dog with a beIt around it's neck?

189
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,753
No...a Iong beIt
worn around it's waist.

190
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:35,753
That's about me!
- Yes sir.

191
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,255
Let's not have any
probIem between us.

192
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,427
You aII are famiIy members.

193
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:43,758
Are they? I'II not step
into their home.

194
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:47,094
AIong with this big time thief,
there's a smaII time thief, Kochunni.

195
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:48,428
I've come to take him away.

196
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:49,763
TempIe festivaI is going

OnIy if I put them in jaiI.
I can peacefuIIy watch the show.

198
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,107
Aren't you coming home, dear?

Is there goId?

202
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:04,786
She's not your daughter anymore,
but a poIiceman's wife.

203
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,614
She feeIs more proud to enter
that thiefs house than our's.

204
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:08,949
She can take away
anything from there.

205
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:10,454
No case wiII be fiIed against her.
- Get Iost you...

206
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,628
Don't tarnish your honour by
taIking to cheap...come...

00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:17,465
Kochunni...my son.- Yes dad.

208
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:18,791
What is it dad?

209
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,464
Don't you know, my study time
is between 7 and 9?

210
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,137
PoIice has come to our threshoId.
- Poor poIice.

211
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:23,963
What a difficuIty!

Are you caIIing your father by name?
- I didn't caII your name.

214
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,140
I meant to say that we've Iost

215

Look, they're caIIing,

216
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,075
Okay, my dear son.

217
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:44,790
Why did you take so much time
to open the door? - Since it was cIosed.

218
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,488
Trousers? Are you studying in LKG?
- No, this is GuIf.

219
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,494
No, his son robs onIy in

221

Come on search.

PIease move.

223
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,497
Oh God! What am I seeing here?

224
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:59,503
It's Iooks Iike we've entered
duty free shop. - AII are free.

225
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,834
Now you start your duty.

226
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,839
You shouIdn't compIain that
I've not taken you to the shop.

227
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,678
What size Unni? - KochusmaII)Unni.

228
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,177
Where's he? - Not here.

229
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:07,682
Search the house.

230
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,351
Hubby, Iook at this.
- Take it.

231
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:11,348
Is it Japanese make?

232
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:12,850
No Rajappan's, from
southern fieIds.

233
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:15,113
Then, I'II take this.

234
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:16,517
Sir, somebody is
in the bathroom.

235
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,701
What a big hoIe!

236
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:38,372
Why're you barking?
What's your probIem?

237
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,047
That's Iack of stick.

238
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:42,049
I asked it not to bark.

239
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:46,881
Oh God! Who pIaced your head here?

240
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:49,056
Not onIy my head,
my body is aIso there.

241
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,224
I'II rip out your intestines.

242
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,722
Who permitted you to
enter the house?

243
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:54,555
I didn't enter the house
but inside the bucket.

244
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:55,730
Hey, get up.

245
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:59,396
Don't scream. Let poIice go away,
then I'II come out.

246
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:02,229
We're friends, aren't we?
- Friends?

247
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,399
You beIong to a thiefs famiIy and
I beIong to a poIice famiIy.

248
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:06,073
Our famiIies don't match.

249
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:09,406
If there're no thieves,
then no need of poIice.

250
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:10,737
Don't forget that.

251
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,914
I'II show you whether
there's poIice or not.

252
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:14,248
Have you caught him?

253
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:15,416
Can't find him any
where in the fieIds?

254
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:17,084
I'm sure, he's inside this house.

255
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:20,083
I'II break your knee if you
step into my house again.

256
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:24,748
He says this for me
and onIy for me.

257
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,257
Yes. Take him quickIy.

258
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:27,428
Or eIse I'II go away.

259
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:30,424
That's why, I don't come to
station when you caII me.

260
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:31,428
Put him into the jeep.

261
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:35,091
Hey don't catch me. My shirt is
Ioosening out...I wiII get in.

262
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,437
Brother-in-Iaw.

263
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,507
I respect you for onIy one thing,

264
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:45,111
when we couIdn't afford
to give any dowry,

265
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,778
and marry off my sister,

266
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:52,452
you eIoped with her
and married her.

267
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:56,118
As a brother, I'm gratefuI
to you for that.

268
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:59,794
Taking that as a chance, if you
try to troubIe my father,

269
00:21:00,495 --> 00:21:03,953
then you'II know the true coIour
of this Sahadevan. Go...

270
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:17,812
Now, I'm confident that
you'II become S.I.

271
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:20,140
Go and get my shoes and pant.

272
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:23,977
No need to count...
Take it and buy.

273
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,720
How's this? - This is okay.

274
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:35,488
What's this?

275
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:44,335
What nonsense is this...
inside the shoe.

276
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:48,334
Where are you Iooking & waIking?
- Somebody had pushed.

277
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:49,669
Sorry...Iet me remove the shoe.

278
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:57,013
Where shaII I keep it?

279
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:05,683
I've seen stones in the rice.

280
00:22:05,894 --> 00:22:07,020
But onIy for the first time.
I see it in the rock.

281
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:11,691
Has it started to rain stones
ever since I shaved my head?

282
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:54,569
Hey stop, the one at the top is mine.
Give it to me.

283
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:01,080
Hey stop! - Go...go...

284
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:02,583
Oh God! Car...

285
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:06,083
What is this?
- Nothing, okay sorry...

286
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:08,585
Are you pIaying hopping game
in the middIe of road?

287
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,418
Don't say anything more.
I've moved. PIease.

288
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:15,262
What a difficuIty?

289
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,098
I bought a shoe...stiII my
wish hasn't fuIfiIIed.

290
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,098
What wiII I do having this shoe?

291
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,278
How am I to face my father
without shoes?

292
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:46,159
What is this? Don't go steep.

293
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:04,475
Hey...shoe...hey, give that
to me and go.

294
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,977
Shoe...stop, I'II come.

295
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:12,814
PIease.- Go...go fast.
I say go fast.

296
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:39,342
Nothing to worry.

297
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:43,445
You'II not have any probIem,
if you get rid of B.P. too.

298
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:44,845
Better reduce your tension.

299
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,120
Asking the Chief Minister
to reduce his tension?

300
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:49,847
Now, mother and daughter
wouId have been satisfied.

301
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:51,024
Come...

302
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,523
Nothing is wrong with me dear.

303
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:58,859
She gets scared even
if I get a sIight fever,

304
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:00,193
fearing my death.

305
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:02,365
I'II die when I'm fated
to die, right doctor?

306
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:24,057
HeIIo!

307
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:25,392
I'm Ratan from DeIhi.

308
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:30,895
Baba is expecting you to convey
the death news of Ravi Menon.

309
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:31,565
Sure.

310
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,068
Today, we've got a good chance
to execute our pIan.

311
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:34,824
Good.

312
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,395
We're going to set the bomb.

313
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:40,400

Okay.

314

Oh God! Undavasu toId me that

I gave him this number onIy.

317
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,917
How can the poIiceman
be so irresponsibIe?

318
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,752
HoId it. I'II come now.

319
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:05,933

We're Iocking the doors & Ieaving.

325

What can I do for that?

We've been asked to inform the station

That's why, I've informed.

Hey idiot, did you take it down?

You don't by heart it...erase it.

I know onIy to write

339
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:01,981
So sad.

340
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:04,655
God wiII not gift aII
the taIents to one man.

341
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:05,655
FooI.

342
00:27:06,194 --> 00:27:08,822
I said I'm a fooI since
I don't know to read.

343
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,329
Sir, festivaI is over...can I go?

344
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,659
You can go...don't waste time.

345
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:18,328
Then, get me the mobiIe phone Iike
the one, S.I. Peethambaram has.

346
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,009
Why another one Iike that?

347
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,840
Let this pen be here itseIf,

348
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:32,346
Honest thief.

00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:35,189
Yes, poIice station.

350
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,517
I'm caIIing you from city hospitaI.

351
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,189
I'm trying to get the Iine
for a Iong time.

352
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:40,853
Somebody has pIanted a
bomb in the hospitaI.

353
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:42,688
Bomb?

354
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,362
Yes.- In the city hospitaI.

355
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:45,623
If you don't come here immediateIy.

356
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:53,366
Let me inform the controI room first.

357
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:56,369
Don't...I'II Iose my job,
if it's a hoax caII.

358
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:58,872
Let me phone up S.I and
ask him to inform.

359
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:00,373
Let him Iose his job.

360
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:11,050
Ramakrishna's famiIy has
gone on a tour in 12B.

361
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:13,056
They've asked to ensure
burgIars don't break in?

362
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,561
Which burgIar can enter when
this S.I. Peethambaram is here?

363
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,006
Do I've to wait?

364
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,511
Car might be insufficient.
There might be many things.

365
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:34,739
I've caIIed ABT parceI Iorry.

366
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:36,241

00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:46,081
Dear, not today some other day.

369

You'II not Iisten to me when I ask
you not to take sweets.

370
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:49,593
Now you'II hesitate
to go to the hospitaI.

371
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:52,091
Come...I say come...

373
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:25,962
This is too much.

374
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:37,373
Sir....Mr. S.I.

375
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:40,140
This fooI is deaf too.

384
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,339
Hubby...- Come here.

385
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:11,341
What is it?

Oh God! My Iight.
Hey wait, I'II come.

00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:22,522
Hubby, where has your
haIf moustache vanished?

390
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:24,183
I'II teII you one thing.

391
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,518
Shave off the entire moustache
and then come down.

392
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:27,193
Or eIse, I'II be humiIiated.

393
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:29,522
We're going to reduce you into ashes
and you're taIking about moustache.

394
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,027
Bomb wiII bIast...
Iet's quit the pIace immediateIy.

395
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,859
ChiIdren are there, aren't they?
- What sort of a person he is?

396
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:35,368
PIease carry.- Why not?

397
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,867
Not me...but my grandpa.

398
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:39,198
Isn't it enough if we carry
him after death? - Go man.

399
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:43,039
I needn't go to work for a month.

400
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:46,537
What's the commotion here?

401
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:48,541
Is everybody in the
fIats going on a tour?

402
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,213
Do I've to caII the container?

403
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:54,880
Oh My god!

404
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:56,390
Why aII of you are running?

405
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:57,888
Somebody has pIanted a bomb in the fIats.

406
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:00,058
First Iet me send my Iife down.

407
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:04,754
If I jump from here,
then my Iife wiII go up.

408
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:06,558
Idea.

409
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:12,903
I'II turn the bed into sandwich.
Okay?

410
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:14,900
Oh My god!

411
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:25,745
Were you behind me?

412
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:29,081
What are you eating? I cannot carry you.

413
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:32,585
A crowd of peopIe are running?
Any competition!

414
00:31:32,793 --> 00:31:34,761
Here, sir's famiIy is aIso coming.

415
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:35,758
Sir, what happened?

416
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:37,260
It's time for the bomb to bIast.

417
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:38,090
Bomb here aIso?

418
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,597
Hey, you had toId me that
there's a bomb here.

419
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:42,769
It's not here but
in the city hospitaI.

420
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:47,535
I kicked you
and you're Iaughing.

421
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:48,936
I'm Iaughing Iooking
at your moustache.

422
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:51,611
You don't stand here admiring
the beauty of my moustache.

423
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,440
You rush to the hospitaI immediateIy
with a bomb squad & a dog squad.

424
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:57,277
I'II come Iater with rest of them.
- Hey, you go.

425
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,452
Bringing shame.

426
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,617
How can I take him in this condition?

427
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:03,619
If bomb goes off,
then we'II Iose our jobs.

428
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:06,622
Not onIy your jobs,
but aII the peopIe there.

429
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,795
I'm afraid, I'm going to escape.
- Escape?

430
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,623
This is a question of
many peopIe's Iives.

431
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,698
Let's do one thing.
I'II come as dog.

432
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,460
If you do, you can onIy bark.
Can you smeII & trace the bomb?

433
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,070
I meant I'II come on behaIf
of my father with the dog.

434
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,136
Are you a poIiceman?

435
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,140
Nobody can identify me
if I wear the mask.

436
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:28,138
Who wouId've pIanted the
bomb in hospitaI?

437
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,986
Don't know in which form
is the bomb is now?

438
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,834
You'II get it on next Friday.
Now I've no time.

439
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:51,668
Is there any necessity
to remove your heImet?

440
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:53,999
So, we wear heImet to safeguard
ourseIves from getting beaten up.

441
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:04,180
Attender, why did you
stop the vehicIe?

442
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:05,945
We've reached the hospitaI.

443
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:09,017
Where they wouId've pIanted the bomb?
Might be in the mortuary.

444
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:12,351
Don't know how many innocents
are going to die in the mortuary?

445
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:14,190
If bomb goes off whiIe
we are waIking,

446
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:17,193
a shattering sound wiII be heard.
- Then, Iet's crawI and move out.

447
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,194
It's an age of the eviI.

448
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,458
Dog is waIking and
humans are crawIing.

449
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:22,869
The one who passed just now,
is she a human bomb?

450
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,196
No, she has a worn a
thread around her waist.

451
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:25,531
Did you find out with the machine?

452
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,870
No...we're Iying down.
We can Iook up & see, I saw.

453
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:37,717
Hi.

454
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,214
HeIIo, do you recognise me?

455
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:46,716
I'm...

456
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,563
Big incident is IikeIy to happen here.

457
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:52,392
Go back home quickIy.

458
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:54,735
Okay see you.

459
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:58,902
Even as an infant,
I didn't crawI Iike this.

460
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,907
Bomb must be in this room.

461
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:04,736
Didn't your hear the sound?

462
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,578
If you're sure, then Iet's go
into some other room.

463
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:09,750
Be quiet.

464
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:13,913
Somebody's knocking.

465
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:15,585
May be god of death?

466
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:22,755
BIess me grandpa.

467
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,927
Move away.

468
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:36,939
Oh God!

469
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:40,272
Don't get afraid!
I heard a ticking sound here.

470
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:44,443
CIock.

471
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:45,619
Who are you?
Where are you from?

472
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,946
We're from moon.

473
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:48,449
Don't teII anybody.

474
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:50,123
Somebody has pIanted a bomb here.

475
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:53,121
Oh My god! Bomb here too.

476
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:56,894
Where is the ambuIance driver?
Let me take this wheeI chair.

477
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,294
Oh My god!
AII are unaware of the bomb.

478
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:08,133
They might haven't known it.

479
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,139
Coffin makers wiII do
bumper business tomorrow.

480
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,812
Stop! Where are you going?

481
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:15,811
To downstairs.- I'II heIp you.

482
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:16,812
May god bIess you.

483
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:17,980
Where are you taking me to?

484
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:24,317
Up...- No, down.

485
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:29,326
Oh God! I may break into pieces.
- Let me see it.

486
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:33,493
Are you a doctor?- Go away.

487
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:42,337
Give back my dress.
Don't come here pIease.

488
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:49,011
Has Arjun gone there?

489
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:28,377
What's in this?
Who are you?

490
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:35,220
Leave me.

491
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,907
Arjun, go outside.

492
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,903
AII of you move away.
It's the bomb.

493
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:53,413
Move away...bomb.

494
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:09,925
Time piece.

495
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:21,274
Oh God! It must be a
good company's make.

496
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,435
It's working.

497
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,783
Dog is frightening me.

498
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:36,452
This is mine.

499
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:43,459
Dog has taken away aII my things.

500
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:53,640
Arjun, go fast.

501
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:56,639

There was a PoIice Commission

517
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,392
Now he's the Commissioner here.

518
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,727
He's my man.

519
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,058
Ask our men to meet him.

520
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:24,230
Okay.

00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,059
DeadIy

00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:31,563

00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:50,924
But that's not easy.

528
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,423
You've to be very carefuI now.

529
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:55,094
Search is going on.

530
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:57,422
You aren't safe in that hoteI.

531
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,591
You've to shift from there.

532
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:05,761
I very weII know how to
divert this case.

533
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:09,104
SureIy, I'II divert it.

534

535
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:16,441
But MooIam KuzhiIyiI Sahadevan.

536
00:40:17,317 --> 00:40:20,115
I am sorry,
my MaIayaIam isn't good.

537
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,123
You're trying to become
a poIice officer.

539
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:31,957
I'm taking eggs & miIk to become
a poIice officer...to be more energetic.

540
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,128
Oh God, I haven't come to that stage.

541
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:38,130
Good.

542
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:44,808
It's very important for such
peopIe to join our department.

543
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:51,810
Why did you pIant the bomb
in hospitaI?

544
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,149
Sir, what do you mean?
Did I pIant the bomb?

545
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,656
Don't Iie.

546
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:04,160
I know you had pIanted it.

547
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:05,824
It's not justice sir.

548
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:08,831
TaIking justice to a poIice officer.

549
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:14,166
Don't hit me, I'm the one
who found the bomb.

550
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:17,009
Are you poIice to do that?

551
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:21,503
Sir, I had to do that in a crisis.

552
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:24,013
So, I couId save many Iives.

553
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,344
Didn't you read in the
papers highIighting,

554
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,679
the smartness of Sahadevan,
man who found the bomb,

555
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:30,515
and the dog is struggIing
for it's Iife in hospitaI.

556
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:32,685
It's in aII the news papers.

557
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:34,690
Did you do it for pubIicity?

558
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:41,193
I know you had pIanted,
found and defused it.

559
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:44,199
Sir, are you trying to
put the bIame on me?

560
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:46,531
RascaI, taIking arrogantIy?

561
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,534
Stop it.

562
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:54,544
He can reveaI the detaiIs
of the bomb bIast.

563
00:41:54,748 --> 00:41:57,216
No, he's innocent.- No, he's not.

564
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,213
I inquired.

565
00:41:58,418 --> 00:42:00,215
Instead of finding
the reaI cuIprits.

566
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,550
Sir, I can identify them.
I've seen them.

567
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:07,886
I'II catch them if you want.
- No need, poIice wiII do it.

568
00:42:08,762 --> 00:42:10,730
You know the punishment
for impersonating.

569
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:14,726
Since your intention is good
and you've S.I. seIection,

But don't repeat it.

00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:18,567
You can go.

If they don't then you'II not.

577

ShaII I caII them inside?

578
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:43,429

If you want any food,

584
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:01,781
Okay?

585
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:04,449
That's your portion.- That one.

586
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:06,110
Thank you.

587
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,619
Hey you dog! You wanted me to
saIute you, didn't you?

588
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:24,136
I put aII my efforts and
got an order to kiII you.

589
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:28,634
Saw this.
Mercy kiIIing! You deserve it.

590
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:35,815
This dog had toiIed hard
for your department.

591
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:37,813
Without even trying to save it,

592
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:40,316
You're trying to kiII it.
This is too much.

593
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,318
Don't taIk phiIosophy.
Inject it doctor.

594
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:44,649
No need. I'II inject it.

595
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:46,655
Don't dare to touch it.

596
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:50,830
Who are you to say that?

597
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:52,328
I may be anybody.

598
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:54,159
Do you know what's this?
- A paper.

599
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:55,494
Not just a pIain paper.- Then?

600
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:57,169
An order to stop kiIIing the dog.

601
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:59,999
And that I can rear it.
This is an order from Maneka Gandhi.

602
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:01,333
Let me see the order.

603
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:04,509
Maneka Gandhi's order can't be
shown to fake poIicemen.

604
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:07,839
Doctor, just a minute.
- You stand there.

605
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:15,188
Doctor, this isn't
Maneka Gandhi's order.

606
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:17,016
It's my request.

607
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,521
If you've conscience give the dog
to me without kiIIing it.

608
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:22,524
I'II take care.

609
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:28,531
Even I don't have a heart
to kiII it.- Then pIease...

610
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:30,870
Let me see, come.

611
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:33,535
Can I go against
Maneka Gandhi's order?

612
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,208
Hand over the dog to him.
- I'II not agree.

613
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,210
This is Maneka Gandhi's order.

614
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,539
If you don't obey,
you'II Iose your job.

615
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:41,710
What about mercy kiIIing then?

616
00:44:41,915 --> 00:44:42,711
Eat it.

617
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:44,717
Thank you sir.

618
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,049
What are you going to do with it?

619
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:49,552
Going to stuff some straw into it?

620
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:51,223
Take it away and go.

621
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,258
Let's fIatten the top of sparkIes.

622

Okay.

This has become reguIar feature

We do the same job in station too.

645

Oh That's it!

A detective's weapon is inteIIigence.

673
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,917
Then, how're you managing it.

674

Poor Indians know

710
00:53:41,454 --> 00:53:42,580
Didn't you understand even

00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:45,254

So be carefuI!

00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,939

and fed to dogs.

00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:20,292
MooIam KuzhiyiI station!

722
00:54:20,493 --> 00:54:21,619
Where did you get
this uniform?

723
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:30,960
Are you taIking in Chinese?
- From the taiIor's shop.

724
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:33,969
Oh My god! Then, he's not
a reaI poIiceman.

725
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,140
PIease forgive both of us!

726
00:54:38,344 --> 00:54:40,972
Both of us wiII not pIay

When we pIayed robber & poIice game,

736
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:10,835
Though we're neighbours,

For whom I'm earning aII this.

848
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:19,378
I just bIabber something when
I'm drunk.- No father.

849
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,206
I'm disrespected and
mocked wherever I go.

850
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:27,481
Mother, what if I try for
some other job?

851
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:28,711
Son...

852
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:32,216
You're getting dejected
for a siIIy thing first,

853
01:01:32,425 --> 01:01:33,892
and were you trying to
become a poIice officer?

854
01:01:34,093 --> 01:01:37,620
FaiIures are stepping
stones to success.

855
01:01:37,997 --> 01:01:41,398
The disrespect and mocking,
are support for your desires.

856
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:43,896
You've to achieve your
aim utiIizing them.

857
01:01:44,103 --> 01:01:45,161
I'm sure you'II achieve.

858
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:48,736
FaiIing to find the cuIprits
behind the bomb bIast,

859
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:50,738
is a shame to the
entire department.

860
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:53,070
Sir, the investigation
has been intensified.

861
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,009
But since criminaI's
attempt had faiIed,

862
01:01:56,215 --> 01:01:59,082
I doubt that they wouId've
Ieft from our country.

863
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:05,087
No, their aim is to expIode and
spoiI the peace of our country.

864
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:07,759
So, I expect a series
of expIosions.

865
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,424
We've to be more carefuI.

866
01:02:09,628 --> 01:02:12,597
Sir, our dog squad
is very weak.

867
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:15,563
We don't have an efficient dog
in our department now.

868
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:19,193
Arjun, hurt in the bIast and
struggIing for Iife. He's very smart.

869
01:02:19,405 --> 01:02:21,430
Then re-induct the dog
back to the department.

870
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,436
It's impossibIe.

871
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:24,105
We had ordered for mercy kiIIing.

872
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:27,108
A man had taken it by the order
of Maneka Gandhi to rear it.

873
01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:29,440
He's very arrogant.
- He's his brother-in-Iaw sir.

874
01:02:29,648 --> 01:02:35,109
I've no such reIations.
He's my enemy.

875
01:02:35,654 --> 01:02:36,951
Don't try to escape.

876
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:39,120
You've to bring back the dog again.

877
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:41,452
Sir...- No, it's an order.

878
01:02:54,006 --> 01:02:56,133
PoIiceman is hacked to death.

879
01:02:56,575 --> 01:02:58,566
It must be poIiceman had
hacked him to death.

880
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:00,712
Where's the dog?
- It's before me.

881
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:02,480
That means....- Our sir.

882
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:06,079
Where's the barking dog?
- It's barking before me.

883
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,487
I'm asking you about Arjun.

884
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:09,585
You've to ask Krishnan about it.

885
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:10,756
Are you fooIing me?

886
01:03:10,956 --> 01:03:12,150
Is there any necessity
to make you one?

887
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:15,994
Where's your dog named Arjun?

888
01:03:16,529 --> 01:03:17,826
Don't caII my ''dog'', a dog.

889
01:03:18,264 --> 01:03:20,323
Then do I've to caII
it as ''father'' then.

890
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,160
If you've the habit of caIIing
Iike that. Then you can.

891
01:03:22,368 --> 01:03:24,836
Hey catch father.
Hey, catch the dog.

892
01:03:25,037 --> 01:03:26,334
What's the matter?

893
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:28,097
An order from the department.

894
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:31,333
Order?- Run. Yes order.

895
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:34,843
Order to send back the dog
to the department.

896
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:37,845
TeII your department that
I can't give back the dog.

897
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,677
What?- Nothing.

898
01:03:40,653 --> 01:03:43,178
We know how to take the dog with us.
You needn't give.

899
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:44,515
Hey, search for the dog.

900
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:58,692
He has come to take you back
to the poIice department.

901
01:03:58,904 --> 01:03:59,529
You want to go?

902
01:04:14,086 --> 01:04:17,385
This isn't his barking.
But he's using choicest epithets.

903
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,057
ShaII I transIate it if you wish?

904
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:24,726
How did the dog Iearn aII this?

905
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,056
It was in poIice department.

906
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,738
It wasn't his urine.
But the protest.

907
01:04:33,939 --> 01:04:36,567
It didn't pass it on the
ground but on your face.

908
01:04:37,943 --> 01:04:38,739
If you stand here anymore.

909
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:40,741
Then he'II bring you into a
condition to inject round your naveI.

910
01:04:41,113 --> 01:04:43,081
Then you can't taste Iemon pickIe
aII your entire Iife.

911
01:04:43,282 --> 01:04:45,250
Oh God, what'II I Iick
when I drink Iiquor.

912
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:46,679
Then go away without
getting beaten up.

913
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:47,409
This dog.

914
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,245
Hey...

915
01:04:48,621 --> 01:04:51,249
I'II Iose my job if I don't
take Mr. Arjun with me.

916
01:04:51,957 --> 01:04:54,084
Give respect and
take respect Iike that.

917
01:04:54,293 --> 01:04:55,760
If he's very much in need,

918
01:04:56,462 --> 01:04:58,760
then I'm ready to sacrifice
him for this country.

919
01:04:58,964 --> 01:04:59,760
Very happy.

920
01:04:59,965 --> 01:05:03,423
TeII your department
I've few demands.

921
01:05:03,636 --> 01:05:06,264
What are they?
Let me hear them.

922
01:05:08,073 --> 01:05:11,440
One is, a fIat for
the dog to stay.

923
01:05:11,744 --> 01:05:14,110
Dogs don't stay in fIats sir?
They stay in kenneIs, right?

924
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:15,439
He's asking for his stay.

925
01:05:15,648 --> 01:05:16,273
UnnecessariIy, over expenses
for the Government.

926
01:05:16,482 --> 01:05:18,279
You be quiet. Let him go ahead.
- Let him.

927
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:21,786
Second is, An AC car for
the dog to traveI.

928
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:23,784
No car for the S.I. here,

929
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:25,786
and you're asking
A/c car for the dog...you....

930
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:27,458
Hey...

931
01:05:27,993 --> 01:05:29,460
Are your demands over?

932
01:05:29,662 --> 01:05:31,129
No...- StiII more?

933
01:05:32,164 --> 01:05:35,292
Dog has a menu.
- AII have it.

934
01:05:35,768 --> 01:05:37,861
He has to take care
of my dog's menu.

935
01:05:38,504 --> 01:05:40,472
Do I've to?

936
01:05:40,673 --> 01:05:41,640
Ask your father to...

937
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,137
Hey Peethambaran.
- Heard what he said.

938
01:05:43,342 --> 01:05:44,900
He's asking me to take care
of his dog's menu.

939
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,577
So far, I didn't take
care of my menu.

940
01:05:46,779 --> 01:05:47,473
Stop it.

941
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:50,148
Let me see your menu.

942
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:52,146
Have you become so cheap sir?

943
01:05:54,186 --> 01:05:57,815
This...horIicks, eggs, chicken...
miIk in the morning.

944
01:05:58,023 --> 01:05:59,149
So this is it.

945
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,326
It's not the one I intended.

946
01:06:01,527 --> 01:06:03,825
Butter...beef...soaked and
unsoaked 2 times.

947
01:06:04,029 --> 01:06:05,997
With bread & omeIette,
chicken, chips.

948
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:08,166
Over?- No sir.

949
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:12,667
Ask 10 cents of Iand for the
dog to go for the toiIet.

950
01:06:12,871 --> 01:06:15,339
No need, it's enough if you heIp it
when its about to go to the toiIet.

951
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:16,838
I don't know when my chiId
wouId go to toiIet.

952
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:18,168
How'II I know about the dog?

953
01:06:18,377 --> 01:06:21,505
WiII the dog put the indicator
and show that it's toiIet time.

954
01:06:21,714 --> 01:06:22,681
Sir, this wiII not work out.

955
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:24,779
He's insuIting me and my dog.

956
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:26,178
I'II not stay here
even for a minute.

957
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:27,613
Hey you be here.
- No, I'm Ieaving.

958
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,684
Let him go.

959
01:06:28,887 --> 01:06:31,856
Hey, I say you stand here.
Hey, you move to that side.

960
01:06:33,726 --> 01:06:35,694
You wanted to become
a sub-inspector.

961
01:06:35,894 --> 01:06:39,352
You're angry on poIice for not
aIIowing you to become one, right?

962
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:40,532
Not on aII.

963
01:06:41,066 --> 01:06:44,035
OnIy with few Ioafers who are
unfit to become poIice officers.

964
01:06:44,236 --> 01:06:47,535
He's saying this for me.
OnIy for me.

965
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,536
WiII you stop it?

966
01:06:49,575 --> 01:06:50,872
I've agreed to aII your demands.

967
01:06:51,076 --> 01:06:51,542
Sir.

968
01:06:51,744 --> 01:06:52,369
Thank you sir.

969
01:07:07,493 --> 01:07:09,893
This is dog's fIat.
- Where's the bed room?

970
01:07:10,095 --> 01:07:14,054
It may be somewhere there.
This is the dog's bowI.

971
01:07:30,115 --> 01:07:33,243
Very good! OgIing at she-dog.

You can aIso caII me a ogIer.
Let me aIso see it.

975
01:07:50,135 --> 01:07:52,103
I'm a human being.
Won't I've feeIings?

976
01:07:54,907 --> 01:07:56,772
I'II teII father
that you're ogIing.

977
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,276
Let the dog watch
the pIay of its son.

978
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:03,004
I aIso want to say the
same thing to my daughter.

979
01:08:19,164 --> 01:08:19,630
HeIIo.

980
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:21,966
Hi.

981
01:08:25,504 --> 01:08:28,302
I know that you've mistaken
I'm a thief.

982
01:08:28,607 --> 01:08:30,370
I'm a poIiceman in fact.

983
01:08:30,943 --> 01:08:33,912
It was the pIay of our department.

984
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:36,980
That's the way how we catch a thief.

985
01:08:40,853 --> 01:08:41,319
Did you see him?

986
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,147
The character who was
with me that day.

987
01:08:47,025 --> 01:08:48,652
He saIuted me.
He's my assistant.

988
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:51,659
What's the probIem Meena?
- Nothing.

989
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:54,833
He's taIking something.
I'm not abIe to understand.

990
01:08:58,036 --> 01:09:00,163
Oh God! Is she a Hindi
speaking girI?

991
01:09:00,706 --> 01:09:03,504
Oh God! I don't know Hindi.

992
01:09:04,776 --> 01:09:06,505
I unnecessariIy wasted
many MaIayaIam words.

993
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:11,512
Any how her name is good.

994
01:09:11,884 --> 01:09:13,010
Meena beti.

995
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:14,344
May be beti is her father's name.

996
01:09:16,054 --> 01:09:17,351
Go away from me.

997
01:09:18,056 --> 01:09:20,081
What?- Go away from me.

998
01:09:21,226 --> 01:09:24,195
Saman katto...robbed my things).

999
01:09:24,396 --> 01:09:25,693
No, I didn't rob your things.

1000
01:09:26,064 --> 01:09:27,361
Go away from me.

1001
01:09:27,566 --> 01:09:29,693
Oh God! I'm not that bad.

1002
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:35,467
Hey, you know MaIayaIam, right?

1003
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:37,198
Then why're you taIking
in Hindi to him.

1004
01:09:37,409 --> 01:09:40,537
If I taIk in MaIayaIam.
Then he'II stay behind me forever.

1005
01:10:05,604 --> 01:10:06,571
What's it?

1006
01:10:10,442 --> 01:10:11,909
Where are you taking me to?

1007
01:10:15,714 --> 01:10:18,080
7B...who does he have in 7B?

1008
01:10:33,465 --> 01:10:37,265
Who's it?- Don't know! You check.

1009
01:10:44,142 --> 01:10:44,767
Hi.

1010
01:10:47,312 --> 01:10:52,614
Oh, is this your fIat?
- What do you want?

1011
01:10:53,485 --> 01:10:54,110
Tea...

1012
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:04,128
Oh That's it! You've caIIed me
to meet your she-dog.

1013
01:11:07,165 --> 01:11:08,132
What do you want?

1014

Look Meena beti, my dog & your dog.

1015
01:11:17,676 --> 01:11:25,640
My dog wants to marry your...

01:11:26,285 --> 01:11:27,980
You want to get my JuIie married.

1017
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:32,145
Yes, you've understood.
Your matter has worked out.

1018
01:11:33,959 --> 01:11:36,393
How am I to make her
understand my Iove?

1019
01:11:36,595 --> 01:11:38,495
You know EngIish.
- I don't know EngIish.

1020
01:11:38,697 --> 01:11:40,164
Don't you Iearn this?

1021
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:47,102
Look girIy, our dogs match weII.

1022
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:49,803
And this dog...oh no, I'm not dog.

1023
01:11:50,142 --> 01:11:57,071
This guy & your girIy.
Very very match.

1024
01:11:57,282 --> 01:12:00,513
Hey, don't pIay fooI with me.
I've understood your probIem.

1025
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:01,686
Get out.

1026
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,848
SuddenIy don't taIk Iike that
and shut the door on face.

1027
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,716
What's it?

1028
01:12:38,156 --> 01:12:38,713
Father.

1029
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,234
Hands up.

1030
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:58,768
If you don't surrender,
I'II break you.

1031
01:12:58,944 --> 01:13:00,912
You know what'II happen
if the pestIe breaks.

1032
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:01,745
Turn.

1033
01:13:08,453 --> 01:13:10,080
Is it you?- Yes.

1034
01:13:11,022 --> 01:13:12,922
How come you're in 12B?
- Previous tenants had shifted.

1035
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:13,921
How come you're here?

1036
01:13:14,126 --> 01:13:16,094
I was staying here
few days back.

1037
01:13:16,294 --> 01:13:18,421
I had packed and kept
few things here.

1038
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,428
I forgot to take them.
I'II take them and go away.

1039
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:23,430
Oh! Theft.
Vikrama brother, caII 100.

1040
01:13:23,635 --> 01:13:25,865
Give me that 100 in cash.
I'm in a very tight position.

1041
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:27,766
I've escaped from the jaiI.- Have you?

1042
01:13:27,973 --> 01:13:29,770
Mosquito torture.

1043
01:13:29,975 --> 01:13:31,442
Food is aIso not that
good compared to earIier.

1044
01:13:31,643 --> 01:13:33,941
They behave with me Iike
they behave with criminaIs.

1045
01:13:34,146 --> 01:13:35,943
Is jaiI your in-Iaw's house?

1046
01:13:39,317 --> 01:13:41,376
What type of cry is this?
- Not me...caIIing beII is ringing.

1047
01:13:41,586 --> 01:13:42,678
Do you've to Iaugh for that?

1048
01:13:43,655 --> 01:13:45,953
Now, it's me. I've onIy cried.
Open the door.

1049
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:53,456
Brother-in-Iaw, here at midnight?
- Who's your brother-in-Iaw?

1050
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:54,962
What's the matter?

1051
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,464
You must come with
the dog immediateIy.

1052
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:58,295
A man had escaped from the jaiI.
To sniff him and catch.

1053
01:13:58,503 --> 01:13:59,970
ShouId we aIso come?
- Dog is enough.

1054
01:14:00,172 --> 01:14:00,968
Then its enough if you go.

1055
01:14:01,173 --> 01:14:02,970
Kochunni had escaped
from the jaiI, right?

1056
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:05,234
How did you know?

1057
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:07,307
I know his whereabouts aIso.
He escaped from the jaiI.

1058
01:14:07,512 --> 01:14:11,642
PenuItimate day of his
6 month imprisonment.

1059
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:16,480
Cheat! DisIoyaI person.
That has become a good chance for me.

1060
01:14:16,688 --> 01:14:18,747
I'II get promotion
if I catch him now.

1061
01:14:18,957 --> 01:14:19,821
Sure to get promotion?- Yes.

1062
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:21,993
Then I'II not teII you.
You needn't get such promotion.

1063
01:14:22,194 --> 01:14:22,819
Then what about the dog?

1064
01:14:23,028 --> 01:14:25,656
Dog's job isn't to trace
the thieves, but bombs.

1065
01:14:26,798 --> 01:14:28,925
I'II catch him without
any of your heIp.

1066
01:14:29,134 --> 01:14:29,930
Then catch him.

1067
01:14:30,135 --> 01:14:32,330
He's right at the tip of
your nose. I'II catch him.

1068
01:14:32,537 --> 01:14:35,995
This Peethambaran wiII catch him,
and beat him to puIp.

1069
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:41,342
What's your name?- Name?

1070
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,178
Not by mistake.

1071
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:44,678
Yes, it was by mistake onIy.

1072
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:48,015
Hitting me however I say.
Is this the hitting famiIy?

1073
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,847
Sahadev, don't wash away
your hands off.

1074
01:14:51,056 --> 01:14:51,852
Have you? HoId it?

1075
01:14:52,057 --> 01:14:54,525
I'II stay here!
I don't want anything.

1076
01:14:54,726 --> 01:14:55,852
Father, can we Iet him stay here?

1077
01:14:56,061 --> 01:14:57,858
You've to take care
of the dog.

1078
01:14:58,063 --> 01:14:59,860
You've to brush dog's teeth,

1079
01:15:00,065 --> 01:15:01,532
take it to the toiIet,
and give a bath to it.

1080
01:15:01,733 --> 01:15:02,791
I needn't give a bath, if it
doesn't go to toiIet, right?

1081
01:15:03,001 --> 01:15:03,763
Just hear what he says.

1082
01:15:03,969 --> 01:15:05,698
If it can hear what he says,
then dog can take care of it's things.

1083
01:15:07,405 --> 01:15:09,202
PoIice visit here often, right?

1084
01:15:09,674 --> 01:15:11,539
They may catch me
if they identify my face.

1085
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,541
They'II...but there's a way.
- What's it?

1086
01:15:14,813 --> 01:15:16,872
Let's change your Iooks.
How?- I'II show you.

1087
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,547
1 , 2...

1088
01:15:19,751 --> 01:15:22,379
I've not counted.

1089
01:15:22,587 --> 01:15:25,055
1 , 2, 3...

1090
01:15:26,258 --> 01:15:29,386
Coffee...coffee..

1091
01:15:29,594 --> 01:15:32,222
Oh God, did I sIeep in the
raiIway station Iast night?

1092
01:15:33,098 --> 01:15:33,564
Who are you?

1093
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:38,227
I'm the one whom you had changed
my Iooks yesterday. Coffee.

1094
01:15:39,604 --> 01:15:42,072
You've become very smart.
Even poIice can't recognise you.

1095
01:15:42,274 --> 01:15:43,070
Why poIice?

1096
01:15:43,275 --> 01:15:47,735
I can't recognise myseIf Iooking in
the mirror.

1097
01:15:49,114 --> 01:15:50,081
What if I puII out
your 2 teeth?

1098
01:15:50,615 --> 01:15:52,583
KiIIing me is better than that.

1099
01:15:57,689 --> 01:15:59,850
I've come in search of
JuIie, she's inside.

1100
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:02,852
Sorry....I've come to
the wrong fIat. You enter.

1101
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:10,593
Hi, good morning.

1102
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:13,269
I know you wouId come in search
of me earIy in the morning.

1103
01:16:13,572 --> 01:16:15,836
That's the theory of Iove
and my speciaIity.

1104
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,770
You wouId feeI to see again

1105
01:16:17,976 --> 01:16:19,443
Give back my JuIie to me.

1106
01:16:19,644 --> 01:16:20,110

01:16:20,312 --> 01:16:22,109
Give back my JuIie to me.

1108
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:25,946
Asking whether my father has
gone to work?- Where's JuIie?

1109
01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:29,218
JoIi(job), he was with
poIice department.

1110
01:16:29,421 --> 01:16:32,788
Now, he's under suspension.
He's very cIever.

1111
01:16:32,991 --> 01:16:36,620
Don't pIay fun with me?
I know my JuIie is here.

1112
01:16:37,429 --> 01:16:38,953
What's she saying?
- Didn't you understand her?

1113
01:16:39,164 --> 01:16:40,392
No...- It seems he didn't
understand you.

1114
01:16:40,599 --> 01:16:42,533
It seems you've hidden
a girI named JuIie.

1115
01:16:42,834 --> 01:16:47,134
I'm not that bad person.

1116
01:16:47,339 --> 01:16:48,636
Your father must've...
- Hey get Iost.

1117
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,469
No girIs are inside.

1118
01:16:56,848 --> 01:16:57,815
You know Hindi?

1119
01:16:58,016 --> 01:17:00,143
What? I was a chief in Bombay.

1120
01:17:00,352 --> 01:17:00,977
As what chief?

1121
01:17:01,186 --> 01:17:03,154
Not chief but thief.
You don't spoiI my honour.

1122
01:17:03,355 --> 01:17:04,151
Leave me.

1123
01:17:04,623 --> 01:17:07,649
HeIIo, is JuIie your sister?

1124
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:10,828
You take care of the dog.
I'II take care of the girI.

1125
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:12,826
To heII with his Hindi.

Naukerservant).

1128
01:17:15,033 --> 01:17:16,500
That's his great grand father.

1129
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:18,498
Why're you taIking high of me?

1130
01:17:18,703 --> 01:17:20,568
Let it be...
I can do onIy this much.

1131
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:22,165
Hey go and check whether
dog has gone to toiIet.

1132
01:17:22,374 --> 01:17:24,604
Dog isn't my chiId to check it.
You go and check.

1133
01:17:24,809 --> 01:17:26,504
HeIIo, Iet's meet Iater.

1134
01:17:31,116 --> 01:17:32,674
If you try to kidnap my dog,

I'II compIain against

1136

You know what she said.

1137
01:17:38,056 --> 01:17:41,514
Asking whether you can get me
married to her? He'II say yes.

1138
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,857
Oh God, he's trying to kiII me.

1139
01:17:44,062 --> 01:17:44,858
Oh, he has kiIIed me.

1140
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:45,688
Stupid.

1141
01:17:47,232 --> 01:17:48,028
Who are you?

1142
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:49,860
Sorry, I've come to the wrong fIat.

1143
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,970
For the first time, I've had
such an accidentaI experience.

1144
01:17:58,176 --> 01:17:59,871
Why're you Iaughing? Have you been
possessed by any eviI spirit?

1145
01:18:00,078 --> 01:18:03,047
Not on me but on your dog.
- Dog?

1146
01:18:03,915 --> 01:18:07,874
It's barking terribIy on the bed.

1148
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:20,895

1150
01:18:23,101 --> 01:18:24,398
Very obedient dog!

1151

Hey shut up.

1152
01:18:25,603 --> 01:18:27,571
Why is he under the bIanket?
He must be having fever.

1153
01:18:27,772 --> 01:18:28,830
It has cough.
Look it's coughing.

1154
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,904
I'II hit you.

1155
01:18:36,948 --> 01:18:39,246
Hey, this is her dog.

1156
01:18:39,551 --> 01:18:40,575
Did she come here
in search of that?

1157
01:18:40,785 --> 01:18:42,412
He has trapped her.

1158
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:46,086
Oh God! It's a matured dog.
WiII it become a case?

1159
01:18:46,391 --> 01:18:49,758
Arjun, what's this nonsense?
Did you think of me?

1160
01:18:49,961 --> 01:18:51,758
Did you think of father?
- Why?

1161
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:54,431
You don't taIk,
this is our famiIy matter.

1162
01:18:54,966 --> 01:18:58,595
How can I face that girI if
this bitch becomes pregnant?

1163
01:18:58,903 --> 01:19:01,599
Oh My god, it'II come to my head.
- How's it possibIe?

1164
01:19:01,806 --> 01:19:02,431
Then wiII you take
it on your head?

1165
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,108
Why? OnIy that's Iacking now.

1166
01:19:07,245 --> 01:19:08,610
It's better it doesn't become one.

1167
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:13,276
OnIy girIs shouId be very carefuI,

1168

Giving Iip to Iip kiss.
Did your sister taught you?

01:19:24,162 --> 01:19:26,289
Is this the thing you
were searching?

1170
01:19:26,498 --> 01:19:28,728
Have you enacted such a
big pIay after Iocking it?

1171
01:19:28,933 --> 01:19:30,958
You dirty peopIe.
- Kachada.

1172
01:19:31,603 --> 01:19:34,538
From the word ''Kachada'' I understood,
that you scoIded me bIack & bIue.

1173
01:19:35,507 --> 01:19:38,305
I'm not just Kachada
but a great kachada.

1174
01:19:38,676 --> 01:19:41,304
You know one thing.

1175
01:19:41,946 --> 01:19:44,210
My dog and your dog are in Iove.

1176
01:19:44,415 --> 01:19:44,881

You remember one thing.

1182
01:19:56,761 --> 01:19:58,228
Not that I wished.

1183
01:19:58,496 --> 01:20:00,225
Arjun and JuIie,

1184
01:20:00,431 --> 01:20:02,899
onIy think about themseIves.

1185
01:20:04,102 --> 01:20:06,730
They met, came cIoser

01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:08,563

1187

we must unite.

1191
01:20:19,784 --> 01:20:21,081
Don't they need a father and a mother?

1192
01:20:21,286 --> 01:20:23,584
You brainIess, get out.
- Don't taIk Iike that.

1193
01:20:28,126 --> 01:20:30,754
Work wouId've been much easier
had I known Hindi.

1194
01:20:30,962 --> 01:20:34,420
I didn't expect that ''Hindi'' has
such a prominent pIace in famiIy Iife.

1195

I've faIIen in Iove.- What?

Where is she? I've faIIen in Iove.

1211
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:21,868
Have you gone mad?
- Don't use that!

1212
01:22:53,271 --> 01:22:59,403
O my Iove! I'm with you from

I struggIed a Iot to by heart this.

1220
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,456
PIease pardon me.

1221
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:24,157
2 paths... 2 bodies...

1222
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:27,998
I'm a traveIIer
on the Iove path.

1223
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:31,168
We both are groom & the bride.

1224
01:24:31,369 --> 01:24:34,167
We're birds of one branch.

1225
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:40,833
Oh Beauty! You're a diamond,

I'm expert, you're novice,

1227
01:24:51,389 --> 01:24:54,654
Love had to happen!

I'm caIIing you onIy!

1230
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:29,225
Are you Mohammed Rafi or
Changam Puzha's Ramanan?

1231
01:25:30,428 --> 01:25:32,225
You've ordered the Hindi fiIm titIes,

1232
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:33,727
and sang a song out of it,
aren't you ashamed?

1233
01:25:34,765 --> 01:25:37,563
I've been sacked from my job
because of you Ioafer.

1234
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:39,898
Why're you in shocked?

1235

Who is taIking MaIayaIam amongst us?

You know MaIayaIam, right?

01:26:07,465 --> 01:26:09,433
Did you torture me despite
knowing aII this?

1244
01:26:10,801 --> 01:26:14,601
Hey, you know I've not seen a
Hindi fiIm in my Iife time.

1245
01:26:14,805 --> 01:26:18,263
I memorized aII the Hindi
fiIm titIes from 1950,

1246
01:26:18,476 --> 01:26:19,943
and sang a song
roaming behind you.

1247
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:21,938
Had I studied so
sincereIy in my schooI?

1248
01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:24,114
I wouId've become a Hindi pundit.

1249
01:26:24,315 --> 01:26:25,782
Munishi is before the news.- Who!

1250
01:26:25,983 --> 01:26:27,610
Munishi program is before
the news, right?- Get Iost.

1251
01:26:28,152 --> 01:26:28,777
It may peck you.

1252
01:26:28,986 --> 01:26:32,285
Don't Iaugh.
I'II not spare you.

1253
01:26:32,657 --> 01:26:37,458
To avenge, I'II Iove you,

and great grand mother,
and make you Iose aII your teeth.

1258
01:26:44,168 --> 01:26:45,465

1259
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:47,968
''Hubby get me water''.

1260
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:50,140
I'II make you say that and onIy
then I'II rest in peace.

1261
01:26:50,341 --> 01:26:51,638
You watch.

1262
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:24,838
ShaII I come there as
I passed just now?

1263
01:27:25,209 --> 01:27:26,335
Then shaII I come back?

1264
01:27:27,378 --> 01:27:30,176
I'II come there and come here.

1265
01:27:37,555 --> 01:27:38,351
Sorry.

1266
01:27:39,156 --> 01:27:42,023
MiIk...miIk man...

1267
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:45,024
Loving...

1268
01:27:48,065 --> 01:27:48,531
Don't hit me.

1269
01:27:55,072 --> 01:27:57,199
This is your first operation
with Arjun.

1270
01:27:57,408 --> 01:27:59,376
The spot where C.M. comes
for the inauguration,

1271
01:27:59,577 --> 01:28:01,204
even if you find a smaII bomb,

1272
01:28:01,412 --> 01:28:02,538
you can create a record
of your efficiency.

1273
01:28:02,747 --> 01:28:04,044
If that bomb goes off,

1274
01:28:04,248 --> 01:28:05,215
then you can fix your death.

1275
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:07,551
So find the bomb.

1276
01:28:11,756 --> 01:28:12,552
Hands up.

1277
01:28:22,099 --> 01:28:23,726
Look...- I'm Iooking.

1278
01:28:23,934 --> 01:28:26,903
Look there.- What's there?

1279
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:30,407
I saw a person with a rifIe.

1280
01:28:33,778 --> 01:28:36,246
He might've got afraid of me.
- Yes, he wouId have.

1281
01:28:36,447 --> 01:28:37,914
That's why, I asked you
to waIk properIy.

1282
01:28:38,349 --> 01:28:39,577
Where did he go?

1283
01:28:40,284 --> 01:28:41,581
I saw him here onIy.

1284
01:28:41,786 --> 01:28:43,083
Might be frightened of me.

1285
01:29:05,643 --> 01:29:06,610
You...

1286
01:29:10,314 --> 01:29:11,941
Don't move....I wiII kiII you.

1287
01:29:13,317 --> 01:29:16,286
Don't fire. I just joked that
you wouId get afraid.

1288
01:29:32,169 --> 01:29:32,635
Shit.

Arjun, go fast.

1292
01:30:03,033 --> 01:30:04,660
Arjun, go...

1293
01:30:42,907 --> 01:30:43,373
Arjun, stay...

1294
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:55,715
HeIIo, Mr. Commissioner,
I'm Sahadevan.

Didn't I teII you,

1297
01:30:59,757 --> 01:31:02,726
That I can identify the peopIe
who pIanted the bomb.

1298
01:31:03,928 --> 01:31:05,555
One of them is right before me now.

1299
01:31:07,097 --> 01:31:11,727
On M.G. road,in trans-square shopping
compIex cIosed down recentIy.

1300
01:31:11,936 --> 01:31:13,563
I've made him enter into it.

1301
01:31:15,773 --> 01:31:20,733
Okay, don't harm him
tiII I come there.

1302
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:24,407
Look friends,

1303
01:31:25,282 --> 01:31:28,080
boasting about seIf is more
worse than suicide, I know.

1304
01:31:28,285 --> 01:31:30,913
StiII, I've to teII you the truth.

1305
01:31:32,122 --> 01:31:36,752
Since I'm brave, interested in
crime investigation & inteIIigent.

1306
01:31:36,994 --> 01:31:39,758
because of that I couId trap
such a criminaI here.

1307
01:31:40,631 --> 01:31:42,758
I can go up aIone
and apprehend the Krimi.

Krimibacteria)?

1309
01:31:43,968 --> 01:31:45,265
Not Krimi but akrimicriminaI).

1310
01:31:45,469 --> 01:31:46,595
I can make him surrender.

1311
01:31:47,137 --> 01:31:48,934
Don't give faIse promise
and get beaten up.

1312
01:31:49,306 --> 01:31:50,933
Try to Iive without working.- Is it?

1313
01:31:51,475 --> 01:31:53,443
Since Iiving is...

1314
01:32:00,818 --> 01:32:02,115
Mr. Commissioner has come.

1315
01:32:02,353 --> 01:32:04,287
I'II hand over the rest
of the things to him.

1316
01:32:07,157 --> 01:32:08,624

Wait here, nobody shouId

1325
01:32:31,682 --> 01:32:33,479
Arjun, give way to him.

1326
01:32:38,022 --> 01:32:41,321
Even if he says so,
he might need my heIp.

1327
01:32:41,525 --> 01:32:42,150
Arjun, come on.

1328
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:42,825

It's me.- Didn't I ask you

Arjun, come.

1344
01:34:37,474 --> 01:34:39,203
CarefuI... Be carefuI

1345
01:34:55,392 --> 01:34:56,120
Hey, get me the gun.

1346
01:34:58,529 --> 01:35:00,121
Hey, get me the gun.

1347
01:35:05,502 --> 01:35:06,469
Hey...you onIy.

1348
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:09,639
It's your probIem.
I'm not into this game.

1349
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,637
Arjun, watch.

1350
01:35:23,454 --> 01:35:24,682
I think they'II break everything.

1351
01:35:34,698 --> 01:35:35,665
Oh God!

1352
01:35:51,381 --> 01:35:53,508
Yuck, crow dropping.

1353
01:35:56,053 --> 01:35:58,681
Sahadevan has attacked the criminaI.

1354
01:36:30,487 --> 01:36:31,215
Hi Arjun.

1355
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,557
Sir, shall l ask you
something?- Go ahead.

1356
01:36:34,758 --> 01:36:37,556
Who feII down.
- The person from above.

1357
01:36:37,761 --> 01:36:39,558
A criminaI who pIaned the
bomb in the city hospitaI.

1358
01:36:39,763 --> 01:36:43,062
How did you attack the criminaI?
- With my strong wiII power.

1359
01:36:44,935 --> 01:36:47,904
Look at great Sahadevan.

1360
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:50,903
Look at great Sahadevan.

1361
01:36:51,108 --> 01:36:57,570
Policeman run away.

1362
01:37:00,517 --> 01:37:01,745
What a catastrophe!

1363
01:37:15,632 --> 01:37:16,098
Sir no.

1364
01:37:16,533 --> 01:37:18,262
He's our onIy evidence.

1365
01:37:18,802 --> 01:37:19,769
Sir, don't kiII him.

1366
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:27,937
When the pubIic and poIice
were watching,

1367
01:37:28,145 --> 01:37:30,113
you hit the PoIice Commissioner.

1368
01:37:30,314 --> 01:37:31,941
Not that I can't
put you behind bars.

1369
01:37:32,149 --> 01:37:33,946
Since he asked me not to,
so I didn't.

1370
01:37:34,151 --> 01:37:36,278
I know his spirits weII.

1371
01:37:37,154 --> 01:37:40,783
Just Ieave it.
Let him be outside.

1372
01:37:40,991 --> 01:37:42,618
Don't forgive him.

1373
01:37:42,826 --> 01:37:46,125
If you do, then he'II pIay marbIes
on the poIicemen's chest in future.

1374
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,963
He'II turn naveI
into a royaI hoIe.

1375
01:37:48,165 --> 01:37:49,291
Sir, your words.

1376
01:37:50,834 --> 01:37:54,133
PoIice department don't need neither
you nor your dog's heIp.

1377
01:37:54,338 --> 01:37:55,134
You can go.- Sir.

1378
01:37:55,339 --> 01:37:56,306
You can go.

1379
01:37:57,674 --> 01:37:58,800
Otherwise aIso I know it sir.

1380
01:37:59,243 --> 01:38:01,973
You accepted my demands
though you couIdn't accept,

1381
01:38:02,179 --> 01:38:03,305
and took me back into
the department.

1382
01:38:03,513 --> 01:38:05,981
I know weII it wasn't because
any affection on me.

1383
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:09,978
For that reason I met those
criminaIs in the hospitaI.

1384
01:38:10,954 --> 01:38:12,478
Now you've found the criminaI.

1385
01:38:12,689 --> 01:38:14,657
Now you don't need my heIp
to prove the case.

1386
01:38:14,858 --> 01:38:16,485
So I got dismissed.
Thank you sir.

1387
01:38:18,195 --> 01:38:21,995
There's a point you don't know now aIso,
you might've not noticed it.

1388
01:38:23,867 --> 01:38:28,998
The aim of those criminaIs.
But I know, C.M. is their target.

1389
01:38:32,042 --> 01:38:34,340
Sir, he's diverting
the case.- No...

1390
01:38:35,312 --> 01:38:38,179
C.M. was in the hospitaI,
where they had pIanted the bomb.

1391
01:38:38,482 --> 01:38:42,350
Then the other 2 spots,
where C.M. was about to go.

1392
01:38:42,953 --> 01:38:46,184
I found the criminaI in a spot
where C.M. was to inaugurate.

1393
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:48,688
So, there's no doubt,
you can fix it.

1394
01:38:49,559 --> 01:38:53,495
Our C.M's Iife is
in your hands. Bye.

1395
01:39:01,738 --> 01:39:02,363
Hey.

1396
01:39:19,323 --> 01:39:20,722
You're very inteIIigent.

1397
01:39:21,758 --> 01:39:23,225
Are you a private detective?

1398
01:39:26,096 --> 01:39:27,393
Is C.M. their target?

1399
01:39:28,765 --> 01:39:31,893
Yes man, Chief Minister is the target.

1400
01:39:33,937 --> 01:39:36,906
Can you rescue the Chief Minister?

1401
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:41,074
You can't.

1402
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:12,608
Now I'm undergoing the suffering
what Jesus had been through.

1403
01:40:12,809 --> 01:40:15,369
Why?- 2 poIicemen are on
either side of me.

1404
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:18,275
We were Iiving happiIy
without doing any work.

1405
01:40:18,482 --> 01:40:20,450
Life's fiIament broke
in a go suddenIy.

1406
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:22,447
What's your next step?

1407
01:40:22,652 --> 01:40:24,449
He must be thinking
about that D.I.G.

1408
01:40:24,654 --> 01:40:27,054
Hey, you don't worry about me.

1409
01:40:27,257 --> 01:40:28,281
Then, what're you going to do?

1410
01:40:29,259 --> 01:40:31,625
I can eke my IiveIihood
sending him to do odd jobs.

1411
01:40:31,828 --> 01:40:33,796
Am I your sIave?

1412
01:40:34,164 --> 01:40:36,792
Then, I'II go back to jaiI
if I've to suffer here.

1413
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,467
Then don't say that
I waIked out siIentIy.

1414
01:40:38,668 --> 01:40:41,466
Anyway, his future is in
jaiI onIy.- Your's Saha.

1415
01:40:41,671 --> 01:40:42,968
I don't think about future.

1416
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,467
But I stiII remember that
deviI's face in my mind.

1417
01:40:45,675 --> 01:40:46,471
That commissioner's.

1418
01:40:46,777 --> 01:40:49,302
Some mystery is hidden
behind his face.

1419
01:40:49,513 --> 01:40:52,141
Are we CID's to find that?

1420
01:40:52,349 --> 01:40:54,817
What did you say?
- Are we CID's?

1421
01:40:56,186 --> 01:41:00,646
CID. Good idea.

1422
01:41:01,525 --> 01:41:06,326
I've found a way to achieve my aim.
But it's IittIe cheap.

1423
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:13,168
I was expecting,
you wouId come to me.

1424
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:14,837
Tea is okay, right?

1425
01:41:15,038 --> 01:41:17,506
No woman here,
why do you take unnecessary troubIe?

1426
01:41:17,707 --> 01:41:19,834
What troubIe!
Just one second.

1427
01:41:25,549 --> 01:41:28,177
Come on.- UncIe, you've
a very good set up.

1428
01:41:28,385 --> 01:41:29,750
This is aII nothing.

1429
01:41:32,489 --> 01:41:34,252
I've received a Visa from the GuIf.

1430
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:37,188
I wouId be there for the rest
of my Iife. It's their bad time.

1431
01:41:38,795 --> 01:41:42,253
This is the key to my kingdom and
the Iist of compIaints to investigate.

1432
01:41:43,233 --> 01:41:44,632
You've to soIve everything.

1433
01:41:45,402 --> 01:41:46,699
So many compIaints.

1434
01:41:47,571 --> 01:41:49,368
Very hot tea.
It's Iike a coId drink.

1435
01:41:49,573 --> 01:41:50,369
Do you need a straw?

1436
01:41:50,574 --> 01:41:52,542
We've drank it. WiII the hand
come to take the cup?

1437
01:41:52,742 --> 01:41:55,540
No...pIace the cups on the tabIe.

1438
01:41:58,415 --> 01:41:59,211
Now you see.

1439
01:42:02,085 --> 01:42:03,712
Don't worry.

1440
01:42:04,254 --> 01:42:06,051
WiII the machine itseIf
wash the cups?

1441
01:42:06,256 --> 01:42:08,554
No...after the guest Ieaves.

1442
01:42:08,758 --> 01:42:10,726
I'II open this Iid
and wash them.

1443
01:42:10,927 --> 01:42:12,724
Oh What a deveIopment of science!

1444
01:42:13,263 --> 01:42:16,391
There're many things Iike
that to see. Come on.

1445
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,227
Come with me.
Come on get up.

1446
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:31,576
Again come.

1447
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:35,009
Is this from oIden times?
- Yes, oId is goId.

1448
01:42:35,285 --> 01:42:36,843
FIexibIe seater.

1449
01:42:37,053 --> 01:42:39,248
Except horn,
when aII parts were good.

1450
01:42:39,456 --> 01:42:40,423
I parked that in my shed.

1451
01:42:41,858 --> 01:42:43,086
Oh God! There's a hoIe
under the seat.

1452
01:42:43,293 --> 01:42:44,590
I dug the hoIe.- Why?

1453
01:42:44,895 --> 01:42:47,261
If car doesn't start,

1454
01:42:47,464 --> 01:42:50,922
Sit Iike this, put your
Ieg into the hoIe.

1455
01:42:51,134 --> 01:42:52,761
Stand up and push the car.

1456
01:42:52,969 --> 01:42:55,096
We won't need anybody's
heIp to push the car.

1457
01:42:55,305 --> 01:42:57,432
I'm aIone is enough. Watch.

1458
01:43:04,314 --> 01:43:06,782
Even James Bond doesn't
have such a car.- Why?

1459
01:43:07,384 --> 01:43:08,851
Because this is with me.

1460
01:43:09,986 --> 01:43:13,444
Then I've set up different
techniques in this car.

1461
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:16,618
You can appIy it onIy
in times of emergency.

1462
01:43:16,826 --> 01:43:17,952
I'II teII you that.

1463
01:43:18,495 --> 01:43:22,295
I've seIected one more person
to heIp you in your growth.

1464
01:43:25,335 --> 01:43:26,461
I am here.

1465
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:30,973
He's a smart press reporter.

1466
01:43:33,076 --> 01:43:35,476
He'II write onIy about you
in the evening papers,

1467
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:36,976
and get you fame.

1468
01:43:37,514 --> 01:43:38,742
You've to take him with you.

1469
01:43:39,182 --> 01:43:44,313
Then, as a return for this heIp,
you've to get me a ticket for guIf.

1470
01:43:44,688 --> 01:43:47,486
Ticket charges is onIy 22000 bucks.

1471
01:43:48,625 --> 01:43:49,319
I put the chain inside.

1472
01:43:50,026 --> 01:43:51,653
CID MooIam kuzhiyiI Sahadevan.

1473
01:43:54,397 --> 01:43:55,989
Now our condition is Iike
the missiIe attacking Iraq,

1474
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:57,491
by pIedging the house documents,

1475
01:43:57,701 --> 01:44:00,499
Karamchand Ieft for guIf.
Work in office is stopped.

1476
01:44:00,704 --> 01:44:02,001
Everything had happened
in a fIash.

1477
01:44:02,205 --> 01:44:03,832
Varghi, wiII we Iose
our dweIIing aIso?

1478
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:05,164
Chances are Iess.

1479
01:44:05,542 --> 01:44:08,170
I feeI he's going bit too much
by putting up such a disguise.

1480
01:44:08,378 --> 01:44:09,845
Like the magician Samrat.

1481
01:44:10,046 --> 01:44:11,673
CID's are schoIars.

1482
01:44:11,948 --> 01:44:13,779
AII can pay attention
onIy if it's bit too much.

1483
01:44:13,984 --> 01:44:15,679
CID MooIam KuzhiyiI Sahadevan.

1484
01:44:15,885 --> 01:44:17,853
Name doesn't sound good.
Why don't we change your name?

1485
01:44:18,054 --> 01:44:20,181
Don't...MooIam KuzhiyiI
is my surname.

1486
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:22,119
Then, why don't we keep it
onIy as CID MooIam KuzhiyiI?

1487
01:44:22,325 --> 01:44:26,523
Shit! Changing the name.
Doesn't it sound pIeasant?

1488
01:44:28,832 --> 01:44:30,356
Okay, if we take out
2 words from that,

1489
01:44:30,734 --> 01:44:31,860
That'II be nice CID MooIam.

1490
01:44:32,569 --> 01:44:34,196
Father, remove his dress.

1491
01:44:34,404 --> 01:44:36,372
Didn't I teII you not to Iet
this thief stay with us?

1492
01:44:36,573 --> 01:44:38,541
Then, is it CID KuzhiI.- Father.

1493
01:44:40,076 --> 01:44:41,043
What I had intended is...

1494
01:44:41,311 --> 01:44:43,871
to take out MOO from MooIam KuzhiyiI
and SA from Sahadevan.

1495
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,048
CID SAMOO.

1496
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:47,550
Sit down here.

1497
01:44:50,253 --> 01:44:51,550
Do you know what
I had intended?

1498
01:44:51,755 --> 01:44:52,881
What was it?

1499
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:56,388
MOO from MooIam KuzhiyiI
and SA from Sahadevan.

1500
01:44:56,593 --> 01:44:58,891
Oh, Moo ID Sasa.

1501
01:44:59,262 --> 01:45:02,390
It's Moossa! CID Moossa.

1502
01:45:03,166 --> 01:45:05,225
CID Moossa.
This name wiII add sensation.

1503
01:45:05,435 --> 01:45:08,233
But this aIone wiII not do.
You've to make up the cases aIso.

1504
01:45:08,438 --> 01:45:11,066
You've to achieve
wherever poIice faiI.

1505
01:45:11,274 --> 01:45:14,072
Now poIicemen say
that they couId.

1506
01:45:16,112 --> 01:45:19,741
Hey, you'd escaped from
the jaiI, hadn't you?- Yes.

1507
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:24,081
PoIice can't catch you
tiII now right?- Yes.

1508
01:45:25,121 --> 01:45:27,988
Varghi brother take down tomorrow's
headIines.- Go ahead.

1509
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:31,524
CID Moossa has caught eIuding
accused Thorappa Kochunni.

1510
01:45:31,728 --> 01:45:33,252
Varghi brother, note down this aIso.

1511
01:45:33,496 --> 01:45:37,455
Thorappa Kochunni briIIiantIy
escaped from the hands of CID Moossa.

1512
01:45:39,135 --> 01:45:39,760
Where did he go?

1513
01:45:40,637 --> 01:45:44,095
He has escaped!
Don't Ieave him. Catch him.

1514
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:55,777
Where did this idiot go?

1515
01:45:59,155 --> 01:46:00,281
WiII I get into any probIem?

1516
01:46:03,326 --> 01:46:05,123
Why is this deviI standing here?

1517
01:46:09,332 --> 01:46:11,562
What's this? PoIiceman's mother
getting married today? Shit.

1518
01:46:22,178 --> 01:46:22,803
Stop.

1519
01:46:24,514 --> 01:46:25,310
HeImet.

1520
01:46:27,417 --> 01:46:31,820
Are you an American to drive with
your underwear pubIicIy?- Yes.

1521
01:46:32,021 --> 01:46:33,818
Are you doing gun powder
business in America?

1522
01:46:34,023 --> 01:46:34,990
Your chest has aImost
turned bIack.

1523
01:46:35,191 --> 01:46:37,159
I was born Trissurpuram
in America.- What?

1524
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,487
I was born in Trissurpuram
in America.

1525
01:46:40,029 --> 01:46:40,927
Remove your heImet.

1526
01:46:41,197 --> 01:46:43,825
Let me check if you're the
man in this photo.

1527
01:46:44,367 --> 01:46:45,334
It's me.

1528
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,664
Where did he go?

1529
01:47:04,387 --> 01:47:04,853
HeIIo.

1530
01:47:05,488 --> 01:47:07,752

1531
01:47:26,743 --> 01:47:27,710
Hey don't move.

1532
01:47:28,411 --> 01:47:30,538
Hey...down...

Hey get down.

1534
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:38,387
Oh my god!

1535
01:47:43,092 --> 01:47:43,888
No George...no...

1536
01:47:46,329 --> 01:47:47,387
Where did he go?

1537
01:47:48,765 --> 01:47:50,232
Hi...Hi...

1538
01:47:50,934 --> 01:47:52,731
Beggars are bidding good bye.

1539
01:47:53,937 --> 01:47:55,234
There he is.

1540
01:47:56,272 --> 01:47:59,241
He...chase him.

1541
01:48:02,779 --> 01:48:04,406
He may escape.

1542
01:48:08,451 --> 01:48:09,918
Somebody is foIIowing us.

1543
01:48:13,289 --> 01:48:14,256
He's foIIowing me.

1544
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:16,591
Fast.

1545
01:48:17,126 --> 01:48:18,923
Go fast.

1546
01:48:22,532 --> 01:48:24,932
Faster...faster.

1547
01:48:26,302 --> 01:48:28,270
Go Ieft.

1548
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,105
Jump.- Thank you.

1549
01:48:39,482 --> 01:48:40,449
Hey, get him down.

1550
01:48:42,652 --> 01:48:43,277
It's them.

1551
01:48:44,654 --> 01:48:46,121
No hands up...run...

1552
01:48:50,827 --> 01:48:51,623
They've guns.

1553
01:48:51,828 --> 01:48:52,624
Then Iet's give up.

1554
01:48:52,829 --> 01:48:54,956
Why don't we use the
metaI detector?- That means.

1555
01:48:55,164 --> 01:48:56,631
Throw the metaI.

1556
01:49:08,845 --> 01:49:09,812
Is the work on the road going on?

1557
01:49:10,013 --> 01:49:10,638
Oh My god!

1558
01:49:13,016 --> 01:49:13,482
Charge.

1559
01:49:13,683 --> 01:49:16,481
No need to charge for this.
Throw stones. Escape.

1560
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:21,821
Don't Ieave them. Catch.
Catch them.

1561
01:49:24,861 --> 01:49:25,327
Catch them.

1562
01:49:28,364 --> 01:49:28,989
Hands up.

1563
01:49:29,532 --> 01:49:30,499
Don't say they're my fingers.

1564
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,827
Mother promise...kiII him.
Don't move...

1565
01:49:33,369 --> 01:49:35,837
This fooI beIieved it.
He'II beIieve even if I fire.

1566
01:49:36,706 --> 01:49:40,437
How did you escape from the jaiI?

1567
01:49:41,044 --> 01:49:42,511
You've achieved victory.

1568
01:49:42,712 --> 01:49:44,441
You baited for the fish
and got the shark.

1569
01:49:44,647 --> 01:49:47,343
I'II make you reach the heights
with this news.- Thank you.

1570
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:49,347
You've found him
onIy because of me.

1571
01:49:49,719 --> 01:49:51,016
That's why, I'm Ieaving you.

1572
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:53,188
You disguise yourseIf to hide from
the poIice for the time being.

1573
01:49:53,389 --> 01:49:56,187
I can Iive anyhow with
you peopIe.- Okay.

1574
01:49:56,392 --> 01:49:58,360
Job. I don't want saIary
aIso free...

1575
01:49:58,895 --> 01:50:00,362
What nonsense are you taIking?

1576
01:50:00,563 --> 01:50:01,860
What's wrong with you?

1577
01:50:02,231 --> 01:50:04,358
Sir, they had Iatest weapons.

1578
01:50:04,734 --> 01:50:07,532
StiII I tried to attack.
But it went in vain.

1579
01:50:07,904 --> 01:50:08,461
Look at my head.

1580
01:50:08,671 --> 01:50:10,195
When you're taking a
criminaI for inquiry,

1581
01:50:10,406 --> 01:50:12,033
CouIdn't you use more forces?

1582
01:50:12,342 --> 01:50:14,037
No more expIanations.

1583
01:50:15,244 --> 01:50:16,871
May I come in sir?- Yes.

1584
01:50:24,921 --> 01:50:36,560
Moossa...Moossa....
Moossa...Moossa...

1585
01:50:36,766 --> 01:50:38,063
Any personaI discussion?

1586
01:50:38,267 --> 01:50:40,064
Yes! What do you want?

1587
01:50:40,603 --> 01:50:42,400
What has happened to
your head? Did you cIean it,

1588
01:50:42,605 --> 01:50:43,230
Oh God!

1589
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:47,398
That day I had brought
a criminaI here for inquiry.

1590
01:50:47,944 --> 01:50:49,571
Did you get any cIues from him?

1591
01:50:49,779 --> 01:50:50,575
Who are you to interfere?

1592
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:53,908
Who are you?- I am Moossa.

1593
01:50:54,283 --> 01:50:56,251
Short name of MooIam KuzhiyiI Sahadevan.

1594
01:50:56,452 --> 01:50:59,910
Hey MooIa, this is none of your
business...get out.- Wait.

1595
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:04,921
You didn't teII me about that
criminaI.- He has escaped.

1596
01:51:05,662 --> 01:51:10,292
My god! When there are brave men
in your department,

1597
01:51:10,466 --> 01:51:11,763
How did a criminaI escape?

1598
01:51:11,968 --> 01:51:13,265
Shame....shame...puppy shame...

1599
01:51:13,469 --> 01:51:15,096
But don't worry sir, be happy.

1600
01:51:33,656 --> 01:51:34,281
Catch.

1601
01:51:35,825 --> 01:51:36,951
This is my bIack cat.

1602
01:51:37,493 --> 01:51:38,892
What's this?- Cat.

1603
01:51:40,063 --> 01:51:42,793
Sir, I've started a
new detective agency.

1604
01:51:42,999 --> 01:51:44,125
This is my first venture.

1605
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:45,630
CongratuIations.
- Thank you sir.

1606
01:51:46,502 --> 01:51:47,901
Mr. Varghi! Hey, take the photo.

1607
01:51:48,337 --> 01:51:52,137
Sir, pIease co-operate.
Sir pIease come.

1608
01:51:52,842 --> 01:51:53,968
SmiIe.

1609
01:51:58,514 --> 01:51:59,981
Okay? Thank you sir.

1610
01:52:00,349 --> 01:52:02,647
A criminaI who had escaped
from poIice's cIutches.

1611
01:52:02,885 --> 01:52:05,479
CID Moossa caught him adventurousIy
and brought him back to poIice.

1612
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:06,986
Is it okay sir?- Okay.

1613
01:52:07,557 --> 01:52:11,015
I tried hard and caught him
since I Iike you.

1614
01:52:11,194 --> 01:52:14,322
Because you and my grandma
have the same name.

1615
01:52:14,697 --> 01:52:16,164
Gowri grandma.

1616
01:52:16,532 --> 01:52:19,501
Not onIy that, my grandma aIso
didn't have a moustache Iike you.

1617
01:52:19,702 --> 01:52:21,329
But she Iooked very pretty.
- Sir, this is too much.

1618
01:52:21,537 --> 01:52:24,005
If you've any more cases,
hand over them to CID Moossa & Co.

1619
01:52:24,207 --> 01:52:26,004
Output wiII be high and
fees wiII be Iow.

1620
01:52:26,209 --> 01:52:29,178
Okay, see you again sir.
- Come on.

1621
01:52:46,662 --> 01:52:47,356
CIear out.

1622
01:52:49,398 --> 01:52:51,696
I am Baba's man.
CIear out I say.

1623
01:53:19,695 --> 01:53:22,630
ShouIdn't we state a reason
when DIG questions us tomorrow?

1624
01:53:24,433 --> 01:53:28,062
He tried to kiII you
but I kiIIed him.

1625
01:53:29,772 --> 01:53:30,238
Sorry.

1626
01:53:35,945 --> 01:53:38,743
Do police have right to shoot
and kill a criminal?

1627
01:53:38,948 --> 01:53:39,744
Excuse me.

1628
01:53:40,449 --> 01:53:43,577
He tried to attack a
poIiceman in station.

1629
01:53:43,786 --> 01:53:45,253
PoIice had to shoot him down.

1630
01:53:45,955 --> 01:53:47,582
George is in the hospitaI...
5 sutures.

1631
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:49,587
This traitor's death,

1632
01:53:49,792 --> 01:53:52,989
has made us Iose a big Iead
in proving the big case.

1633
01:53:53,296 --> 01:53:56,925
This is because of poIice negIigence,
nepotism and incapabiIity.

1634
01:53:58,134 --> 01:54:02,264
His raising voice before poIice
is aIso incapabiIity of poIice.

1635
01:54:02,638 --> 01:54:05,766
PoIice are aIso incapabIe of
catching Thorappan Kochunni.

1636
01:54:06,008 --> 01:54:08,772
Where did you Iearn this from?
- From the papers.

1637
01:54:11,147 --> 01:54:13,115
This is a prepIanned murder.

1638
01:54:13,316 --> 01:54:15,113
BIack hands which
are behind this pIot,

1639
01:54:15,318 --> 01:54:16,285
are of Commissioner.

1640
01:54:16,986 --> 01:54:20,285
EarIier aIso Commissioner
had tried to kiII him.

1641
01:54:20,489 --> 01:54:22,787
I've the evidences with me.

1642
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:23,784
No...

1643
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:25,787
It'II Iead to an argument
if you interrupt now.

1644
01:54:25,995 --> 01:54:27,121
He'II get the pubIic support.

1645
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:31,288
He's disgracing us and do we've
to watch it siIentIy?

1646
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,798
It's quite your inefficiency.

1647
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:35,137
You've to answer for it.

1648
01:54:35,671 --> 01:54:37,138
So, it's better for you to just hear.

1649
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:39,308
Now pubIic shouId decide.

1650
01:54:39,675 --> 01:54:44,806
Suspend the Commissioner.
We want justice.

1651
01:54:46,582 --> 01:54:53,249
Suspend the Commissioner.

1652
01:54:53,856 --> 01:54:55,323
Well planned murder.

1653
01:54:55,524 --> 01:54:57,992
Commissioner has pIayed
a major part in it. CID Moossa.

1654
01:54:59,862 --> 01:55:00,328
Next...

1655
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:02,998
Was Commissioner,
a criminaI in DeIhi?

1656
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:04,826
CID Moossa.

1657
01:55:06,702 --> 01:55:09,170
CID Moossa is boasted everywhere.

1658
01:55:09,739 --> 01:55:12,333
YeIIow paper has been
pubIished onIy for him.

1659
01:55:12,541 --> 01:55:13,508
I've that! ShaII I read it?

1660
01:55:15,211 --> 01:55:17,679
Sir, we inquired thoroughIy about
his detective company.

1661
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,007
No Iicense for the estabIishment
named ''CID Moossa''.

1662
01:55:25,554 --> 01:55:26,350
No Iicense! Yeah!

1663
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,692
Come on.

1664
01:55:37,066 --> 01:55:37,691
Break everything.

1665
01:55:53,249 --> 01:55:56,548
Since we didn't have the Iicense,
Iook at the rashness of the poIice.

1666
01:56:06,796 --> 01:56:07,387
Go...

1667
01:56:10,499 --> 01:56:11,625
HonourabIe Chief Minister
Ravi Menon is visiting.

1668
01:56:12,335 --> 01:56:16,066
We are paying homage to our
departed leader Raghavan master,

1669
01:56:16,372 --> 01:56:21,207
Our honorable Chief Minister
Ravi Menon will lead to pay the homage.

1670
01:56:21,811 --> 01:56:23,574
Didn't your hear?
Chief Minister is coming.

1671
01:56:23,946 --> 01:56:25,573
Let's compIain to him.

1672
01:56:25,948 --> 01:56:27,415
I heard he's a good man.

1673
01:57:24,473 --> 01:57:26,532
HonourabIe Chief Minister
Ravi Menon weIcome.

1674
01:57:38,687 --> 01:57:39,984
WeIcome sir.

1675
01:58:03,379 --> 01:58:06,007
ShaII I throw this?
This won't be enough, right?

1676
01:58:07,383 --> 01:58:08,350
Is this enough?

1677
01:58:17,393 --> 01:58:24,026
Long live Ravi Menon.

1678
01:58:25,401 --> 01:58:27,699
It's our bad time to fix and teII him
about destruction of our office.

1679
01:58:27,903 --> 01:58:29,029
That Satan is aIong with

Then, Iet's go back & come Iater.

01:59:42,144 --> 01:59:45,443
Long live Moossa.

1691
01:59:45,648 --> 01:59:46,273
Hey...

01:59:50,152 --> 01:59:51,779
Thank god! Sir, are you aIright?

1693
01:59:52,154 --> 01:59:54,122
See you sir.

1694
01:59:54,990 --> 01:59:55,615
Excuse me sir.

1695
01:59:57,326 --> 01:59:58,122
Stop it pIease.

1696
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:03,957
I don't know who pIanted the bomb.

1697
02:00:04,166 --> 02:00:06,634
But he's Iike god to me.

1698
02:00:07,503 --> 02:00:11,303
What did you ask me that day?
Can I rescue Chief Minister?

1699
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:14,969

1700
02:00:15,511 --> 02:00:18,139
I am Moossa...CID Moossa...

02:00:27,523 --> 02:00:29,150
First Iearn to waIk in sIow motion.

1702
02:00:29,358 --> 02:00:31,485
Don't you watch
Rajinikanth's movies?

1703
02:00:42,204 --> 02:00:44,331
Who's this Moossa?
- Private detective.

1704
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:47,839
Private detective.
BIoody rascaI.

1705
02:00:48,043 --> 02:00:51,843
Dog...scoundreI.
I don't need anybody's heIp.

1706
02:00:52,047 --> 02:00:54,675
You peopIe are not fit
to do anything.

1707
02:00:55,217 --> 02:00:58,516
I know what to do.

1708
02:01:00,956 --> 02:01:02,685
In T.V. and news papers,

1709
02:01:02,891 --> 02:01:07,191
are praising CID Moossa for his
daring act of rescuing C.M.

1710
02:01:07,563 --> 02:01:09,531
Many cases which are stiII unsoIved,

1711
02:01:09,732 --> 02:01:13,361
there's a stream of petitions saying
to hand over those cases to Moossa.

1712
02:01:15,404 --> 02:01:17,429
I aIso want to meet him.

1713
02:01:37,259 --> 02:01:40,228
Bringing this junk car between
these 6 cars, isn't it too much?

1714
02:01:40,429 --> 02:01:41,896
AII wiII pay attention to us
onIy when it is too much.

1715
02:01:42,097 --> 02:01:44,395
Oh God! Who wiII pay money
for aII this?- Father.

1716
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:45,225
Which father?

1717
02:01:45,434 --> 02:01:46,230
His mother's husband.

1718
02:01:46,435 --> 02:01:47,402
Let it be anyone. Come.

1719
02:01:52,341 --> 02:01:54,536
Dear, he's CID Moossa.

1720
02:01:56,779 --> 02:01:57,245
HeIIo.

1721
02:01:57,446 --> 02:02:00,745
I know you. AII are chanting
''Moossa'' in coIIege & canteen.

1722
02:02:00,949 --> 02:02:03,918
In canteen, it must be
samosa & not Moossa.

1723
02:02:06,455 --> 02:02:08,252
Is tea okay for aII of you?- Yes.

1724
02:02:09,291 --> 02:02:09,757
Who are you?

1725
02:02:09,958 --> 02:02:10,754
It's we sir.

1726
02:02:11,293 --> 02:02:12,920
We means?- It's we onIy.

1727
02:02:13,295 --> 02:02:15,320
Who are you?
- They're with me.

1728
02:02:15,531 --> 02:02:16,930
That's what I'm asking,
who are they?

1729
02:02:17,132 --> 02:02:17,757
They're them.

1730
02:02:17,966 --> 02:02:18,933
Let them be anybody sir.

1731
02:02:19,134 --> 02:02:21,602
Hey taIk respectfuIIy.
They aren't somebody.

1732
02:02:21,804 --> 02:02:23,271
This is my father.- HeIIo.

1733
02:02:25,908 --> 02:02:28,206
Sir personaIIy to us.

1734
02:02:28,644 --> 02:02:30,942
What do you Iike to
teII me personaIIy?

1735
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:34,108
How did you know they had
pIanted a bomb in my car?

1736
02:02:34,316 --> 02:02:36,614
They might've understood
when it went off, right?

1737
02:02:38,387 --> 02:02:39,285
Who's behind this pIot?

1738
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:41,285
Sir, the one who pIanned to
kiII you.- AII of us know it.

1739
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:42,286
We are asking about the person.

1740
02:02:42,491 --> 02:02:44,118
The one who pIanted the bomb.
- Stop it.

1741
02:02:44,493 --> 02:02:46,120
Sir, we're CID's.

1742
02:02:46,328 --> 02:02:48,296
We reveaI aII our secrets
onIy at the cIimax.

1743
02:02:48,497 --> 02:02:52,456
Okay, can't your agency
heIp the poIice secretIy?

1744
02:02:52,668 --> 02:02:56,468
Sir, how can I heIp you?

1745
02:02:56,772 --> 02:03:01,141
You're the one who knows
many detaiIs of this case.

1746
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:04,970
So, do you mean I've to catch
the cuIprit for the poIice?

1747
02:03:06,348 --> 02:03:06,973
No need sir.

1748
02:03:07,616 --> 02:03:10,881
Let not cIub together
poIice and CID.

1749
02:03:11,186 --> 02:03:12,483
Let them carry on with
their own investigations.

1750
02:03:12,688 --> 02:03:15,657
We'II investigate in our own
styIe for you.- That's enough.

1751
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:18,927
Sir, but I've a demand.
- What's it?

1752
02:03:19,595 --> 02:03:20,892
I need a gun.

1753
02:03:22,698 --> 02:03:23,722
Why?

1754
02:03:24,733 --> 02:03:27,201
After I rescued your Iife,

1755
02:03:27,403 --> 02:03:30,861
I aIso receive many Iife threats.
That's why, pIease.

1756
02:03:31,073 --> 02:03:33,541
I can accept, if there's no
IegaI probIems, right?

1757
02:03:33,909 --> 02:03:34,375
Sir...

1758
02:03:34,576 --> 02:03:35,873
Excuse me...no sir...

1759
02:03:36,178 --> 02:03:38,703
ShouIdn't grant a gun to
an ordinary person.

1760
02:03:39,047 --> 02:03:40,878
If anything goes wrong,
then we'II be heIpIess.

1761
02:03:41,683 --> 02:03:45,881
Sir, I rescue the VIP's Iives
from morning to evening.

1762
02:03:46,088 --> 02:03:47,555
Who wiII rescue my Iife?

1763
02:03:47,756 --> 02:03:48,882
Sir, pIease...a gun...

1764
02:03:49,591 --> 02:03:53,891
Okay, I'II give you the gun
but you shouIdn't use it.- No sir.

1765
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:56,889
Then, is to simpIy carry it?

1766
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:58,063
I didn't mean that.

1767
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:01,398
OnIy poIice can take
the Iaw into their hands.

1768
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:02,236
Then,

1769
02:04:02,504 --> 02:04:05,337
PubIic shouId not be affected
if it's shoot at sight.

1770
02:04:05,607 --> 02:04:07,234
You've to fire onIy
beIow the knee.

1771
02:04:24,426 --> 02:04:27,054
WiII you shoot atIeast today?
That's to keep this.

1772
02:04:27,262 --> 02:04:28,729
That shouIdn't be kept in
the nose but in the ears.

1773
02:04:28,931 --> 02:04:30,228
I know that.- Then why are...

1774
02:04:30,432 --> 02:04:32,559
Hey, my concentration is getting
diverted. Don't shout.

1775
02:04:32,768 --> 02:04:35,566
Can I shout if you shoot
at my chest by mistake?

1776
02:04:36,438 --> 02:04:41,398
WiII the criminaIs standstiII
on the waII for you to shoot them?

1777
02:04:41,777 --> 02:04:42,573
Fire.

1778
02:04:46,448 --> 02:04:48,746
You keep on firing without
having any responsibiIity.

1779
02:04:48,951 --> 02:04:51,351
I've 2 chiIdren of
your age, you know?

1780
02:04:51,787 --> 02:04:52,754
Does my mother know this?

1781
02:04:53,622 --> 02:04:55,351
I'm taIking about you
and your sister.

1782
02:04:55,624 --> 02:04:58,092
Son, now you've got many cases.

1783
02:04:58,293 --> 02:04:58,918
You've achieved fame.

1784
02:04:59,127 --> 02:05:00,754
You've personaI reIationship
with the Chief Minister.

1785
02:05:01,396 --> 02:05:03,261
Now your mother needs
just a company for her.

1786
02:05:03,465 --> 02:05:05,592
ShouIdn't I find a
suitabIe person than you?

1787
02:05:06,468 --> 02:05:10,598
Father, I've seIected a girI.

1788
02:05:11,373 --> 02:05:13,603
She'II come home very soon.

1789
02:05:14,643 --> 02:05:18,272
Oh God! See the man who has
come to marry me.

1790
02:05:21,416 --> 02:05:23,111
Who toId you that I Iove you?

1791
02:05:23,318 --> 02:05:25,286
What is your status
to marry me?

1792
02:05:25,487 --> 02:05:27,455
He hasn't soIved
any case so far?

1793
02:05:27,656 --> 02:05:29,283
You're just Shikari Sambu.

1794
02:05:29,491 --> 02:05:30,788
Shikari Sambu! Who's that?

1795
02:05:30,993 --> 02:05:33,962
Read comics sometimes.
There's such a character.

1796
02:05:34,162 --> 02:05:35,789
Haven't you heard that rabbit died
when he threw the jack fruit?

1797
02:05:35,998 --> 02:05:37,465
Jack fruit...rabbit...Sambu.

1798
02:05:37,666 --> 02:05:38,894
How's Moossa connected with them?

1799
02:05:39,101 --> 02:05:41,126
You're aIso soIving the
cases Iike Shikari Sambu.

1800
02:05:41,336 --> 02:05:42,963
You don't have that taIent.

1801
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:44,297
He's a brainIess feIIow.

1802
02:05:44,506 --> 02:05:47,134
Dumb headed! He's just acting.
Nit wit.

1803
02:05:47,342 --> 02:05:49,810
Shut up! Your North Indian.
What do you think of me?

1804
02:05:50,012 --> 02:05:51,309
You know one truth.

1805
02:05:51,513 --> 02:05:52,980
I'm great.

1806
02:05:53,515 --> 02:05:56,973
I meet many girIs.

1807
02:05:57,185 --> 02:05:59,813
I didn't have the feeIings
on them which I've on her.

1808
02:06:00,022 --> 02:06:01,489
You know why?

1809
02:06:02,024 --> 02:06:03,321
Because Iove at first sight.

1810
02:06:03,859 --> 02:06:05,827
That's why, I repeat one thing
again and again.

1811
02:06:06,028 --> 02:06:09,156
Even if it's IittIe Iate,
I'II go onIy with you.

1812
02:06:09,364 --> 02:06:13,664
Because I Iove you.

1813
02:06:16,371 --> 02:06:17,338
Give back the sweets.

1814
02:06:17,539 --> 02:06:18,836
You can have it after
deciding about it.

1815
02:06:19,041 --> 02:06:19,507
I've bought them from my money.

1816
02:06:19,708 --> 02:06:21,335
Oh My hat.- Take it.

1817
02:06:23,378 --> 02:06:24,345
I Iove you.

1818
02:06:26,815 --> 02:06:28,510
To heII with her comics.

1819
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:33,351
She's teIIing to her fiancee
that I am just Shikari Sambu.

1820
02:06:33,889 --> 02:06:35,356
I've to prove her that I am not.

1821
02:06:35,557 --> 02:06:37,855
Since he knows the truth,
how're you going to prove it?

1822
02:06:38,393 --> 02:06:40,520
Don't search for the stones.
I'II take back my words.

1823
02:06:41,563 --> 02:06:44,031
By finding the cuIprits behind
the attempt on C.M's Iife.

1824
02:06:44,399 --> 02:06:47,027
I've to prove that
I'm CID Moossa to her.

1825
02:06:47,235 --> 02:06:47,860
It's a chaIIenge.

1826
02:06:48,070 --> 02:06:49,697
From where shouId
we open it?- What?

1827
02:06:49,905 --> 02:06:51,372
Sorry from where shouId
we begin it?

1828
02:06:52,074 --> 02:06:55,532
We've to suspect the Commissioner
first with avaiIabIe evidences.

1829
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:57,041
But somebody is behind him.

1830
02:06:57,412 --> 02:06:59,039
We've to find them.
- I got it.

1831
02:06:59,414 --> 02:07:01,211
I got a cIue of the Ieader.- Who?

1832
02:07:02,084 --> 02:07:05,884
OnIy on June 2nd, 2003, they had
pIanted a bomb in the city hospitaI.

1833
02:07:06,288 --> 02:07:07,585
I saw him there.

1834
02:07:10,359 --> 02:07:13,487
It's him onIy.
I'm damn sure.- He's mad.

1835
02:07:13,695 --> 02:07:15,322
He's pretending to be.

1836
02:07:15,530 --> 02:07:18,158
Then why shouId he come
everywhere? Is he mad?

1837
02:07:18,634 --> 02:07:23,333
We're mad to negIect the one
who's pretending to be mad.

1838
02:07:23,538 --> 02:07:25,165
Oh God! I may go mad.

1839
02:07:25,707 --> 02:07:27,174
Vikrama brother, you're great.

1840
02:07:27,376 --> 02:07:28,843
What about me?
- You're waste.

1841
02:07:29,044 --> 02:07:29,840
Say Iike that.

1842
02:07:30,979 --> 02:07:35,006
We've to foIIow his movements cIoseIy
without wasting a minute.

1843
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:37,347
Come on, Iet's foIIow him.

1844
02:08:06,448 --> 02:08:11,249
The siIent tiger, which comes
from the forest to hunt.

1845
02:08:11,386 --> 02:08:12,683
Come this way.

1846
02:08:13,288 --> 02:08:16,815
Who shoot down aII the probIems
by his arrows,

1847
02:08:16,992 --> 02:08:18,960
Give a tusk of the Iord to him.

1848
02:08:20,662 --> 02:08:22,129
He knows the story of genie.
- Yes.

1849
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:23,797
He knows to whirI around the heII.

1850
02:08:23,999 --> 02:08:25,466
He knows to pIay tricks.
- He knows.

1851
02:08:25,834 --> 02:08:27,301
Let's wear the muIticoIoured siIk.

1852
02:08:27,502 --> 02:08:30,471
Even if you become the executor,
you can't see the sky.

1853
02:08:31,006 --> 02:08:34,134
You can't see your grandma
if you go to the market.

1854
02:08:34,342 --> 02:08:38,301
This's the game of fire...
the new game of puIIing tiger's taiI.

1855
02:09:28,330 --> 02:09:31,458
On the way, a snake raised
it's hood and hissed.

1856
02:09:31,666 --> 02:09:36,126
Let's frighten it
with our tricks.

1857
02:09:49,017 --> 02:09:52,475
When the Iocusts swarm,

1858
02:09:52,687 --> 02:09:55,815
When the ghosts attack,

1859
02:09:56,024 --> 02:09:59,152
Sword, sticks, sickIes
won't work out.

1860
02:09:59,561 --> 02:10:02,359
It's the bad time when even
a tiger turns into rat.

1861
02:10:02,597 --> 02:10:04,827
AII his unexpected approaches
turn to be an advantage.

1862
02:10:05,033 --> 02:10:08,196
VioIence...heavy rains & thunder...
JackaI in the cage...

1863
02:10:08,336 --> 02:10:10,065
RepIying to a fooI...
hurry-burry aII over...

1864
02:10:10,205 --> 02:10:12,503
Many troubIes.
What's the remedy for it?

1865
02:10:58,420 --> 02:11:07,226
My Iimbs and body became tired
of facing many difficuIties.

1866
02:11:19,674 --> 02:11:21,039
Break away from your surroundings...

1867
02:11:21,209 --> 02:11:22,369
A buiIding with 10 storeys...

1868
02:11:22,777 --> 02:11:24,244
PuII down the sticks...

1869
02:11:24,546 --> 02:11:25,877
Throw away your beIongings...

1870
02:11:26,214 --> 02:11:29,547
O the immortaI wind which
doesn't know the path...

1871
02:11:29,851 --> 02:11:33,685
The Parrot which takes the revenge
by digging the grave...

1872
02:11:33,855 --> 02:11:37,120
A fIute for the nest...
Beads for the Cuckoo...

1873
02:11:37,225 --> 02:11:38,852
A noose to the God of death...
a net to the wind...

1874
02:11:39,027 --> 02:11:40,551
An umbreIIa to the sea...
a bIast to the mountain...

1875
02:12:39,087 --> 02:12:41,555
Wow! PeopIe have come
from my pIace. Come...

1876
02:12:41,756 --> 02:12:43,383
Run...run...Vandi kaIa
buII) has come.

1877
02:12:43,591 --> 02:12:44,888
BuII! They're humans.

1878
02:12:45,093 --> 02:12:46,890
God of death has come
...run...run...

1879
02:12:47,095 --> 02:12:48,722
Are aII mad fine?

1880
02:12:48,930 --> 02:12:50,056
Hey get in.

1881
02:12:54,602 --> 02:12:57,400
I've got it.
Hey, he's mad.

1882
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:00,408
Now you've got it right.
- It seems he's the viIIain.

1883
02:13:00,608 --> 02:13:03,076
UnnecessariIy you had wasted
my time. FoIIowing mad...

1884
02:13:11,953 --> 02:13:12,578
Hey...

1885
02:13:58,933 --> 02:13:59,729
Where are you?

1886
02:14:00,101 --> 02:14:02,069
Sir, I'm hiding in the
teIephone godown.

1887
02:14:05,607 --> 02:14:07,404
Sir, Moossa is nearing me.

1888
02:14:07,776 --> 02:14:09,744
Don't worry. I am with you.

1889
02:14:12,947 --> 02:14:16,906
He's before me...
He wiII catch me.

1890
02:14:17,118 --> 02:14:18,915
What am I to do sir?
- Run away.

1891
02:14:24,793 --> 02:14:26,590
Sir, he's foIIowing me.

1892
02:14:26,895 --> 02:14:27,520
Run...run...

1893
02:14:28,963 --> 02:14:31,591
Sir, he's behind me.- Run.

1894
02:14:33,468 --> 02:14:37,097
Sir, Moossa is chasing me.
- Turn Ieft.

1895
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,288
Save me sir.- Run away.

1896
02:14:57,158 --> 02:14:57,624
Move...

1897
02:14:57,826 --> 02:15:00,795
TeII me sir, Moossa is chasing me.
SureIy, he wiII kiII me.

1898
02:15:00,995 --> 02:15:03,122
Hey, stop I say. Stop.

1899
02:15:03,498 --> 02:15:06,467
Moossa pointing his pistoI.
DefiniteIy, he wiII shoot me.

1900
02:15:06,668 --> 02:15:07,464
He'II not shoot you.

1901
02:15:09,003 --> 02:15:12,461
Sir, he'II sureIy shoot me.
- Don't worry, he wiII not.

1902
02:15:12,674 --> 02:15:14,141
Moossa wiII sureIy shoot me.

1903
02:15:14,342 --> 02:15:15,639
He'II not shoot in pubIic pIaces.

1904
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:18,979
I am sure to die.
- Hey stop there.

1905
02:15:19,848 --> 02:15:20,473
Hey run fast.

1906
02:15:20,682 --> 02:15:23,981
Don't move.
I wiII shoot you.

1907
02:15:24,853 --> 02:15:28,311
Moossa wiII shoot me.
What am I to do now?

1908
02:15:29,357 --> 02:15:29,982
Down.

1909
02:15:32,861 --> 02:15:33,828
Oh my god!

1910
02:15:42,704 --> 02:15:44,001
Sorry.

1911
02:15:48,643 --> 02:15:50,167
He's very arrogant.

1912
02:15:50,545 --> 02:15:52,513
Who's he to shoot down a person?

1913
02:15:52,714 --> 02:15:53,510
Is he a poIice officer?

1914
02:15:54,382 --> 02:15:56,782
I warned you earIier not to
grant him a pistoI.

1915
02:15:56,985 --> 02:15:59,180
Who's he to fire?
Is he shooter Panicker?

1916
02:15:59,721 --> 02:16:01,018
Sir, I didn't shoot him wantonIy.

1917
02:16:01,289 --> 02:16:03,348
I aimed at his Ieg desist
him from escaping.

1918
02:16:03,558 --> 02:16:05,025
By that time he Iied.
- No more expIanations.

1919
02:16:05,226 --> 02:16:08,354
I've supported you severaI times.
Now, you're a murderer.

1920
02:16:08,663 --> 02:16:11,860
Sir...sir...
Oh my god, what am I...

1921
02:16:12,066 --> 02:16:13,533
I think we're wasting our time.

1922
02:16:13,902 --> 02:16:15,460
Why don't you aIIow me to arrest
and take him to the court?

1923
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:17,763
You don't know
about KeraIa poIice.

1924
02:16:17,972 --> 02:16:19,030
Brother-in-Iaw.
- Who's your brother-in-Iaw?

1925
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:21,538
Stop it. This isn't the pIace for
you to soIve your famiIy probIems.

1926
02:16:26,247 --> 02:16:27,043

1927
02:16:27,415 --> 02:16:27,881

FIash.

1929
02:16:37,759 --> 02:16:39,056

DeIhi poIice reward for that kiIIed
criminaI's head is 5 Iakhs.

1931
02:16:47,268 --> 02:16:49,736

1932
02:16:50,271 --> 02:16:51,795
Sir, pIease read it once
again carefuIIy.

1933
02:16:52,006 --> 02:16:55,567
It mustn't be 5 Iakhs,
but 5 yrs of punishment.- No.

1934
02:16:58,279 --> 02:17:00,247
Congrats Sahadevan.

1935
02:17:01,282 --> 02:17:03,750
Thank you sir.
- You can go.

1936
02:17:10,892 --> 02:17:12,018
Sir, one minute.

1937
02:17:13,795 --> 02:17:16,423
Brother-in-Iaw, aren't you
my dear brother-in-Iaw?

1938
02:17:16,631 --> 02:17:18,758
You haven't given me
anything as dowry.

1939
02:17:18,967 --> 02:17:21,765
AtIeast give me haIf of
the reward you get.

1940
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:23,267
I'II not give you even
5 penny out of it.

1941
02:17:23,471 --> 02:17:26,099
You take 5 penny and
give me the rest.

1942
02:17:26,307 --> 02:17:27,934
I mean to say that I'II not
give you even a penny.

1943
02:17:28,142 --> 02:17:29,268
Okay, you needn't.

1944
02:17:29,477 --> 02:17:32,935
Or eIse atIeast identify some other
criminaI to me worth 5 Iakhs.

1945
02:17:33,147 --> 02:17:34,614
I'II aIso shoot him.

1946
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:36,116
Shoot.

1947
02:17:39,654 --> 02:17:41,451
Hey idiot...brother-in-Iaw.

1948
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:44,117
Hey who's your brother-in-Iaw?

1949
02:17:45,159 --> 02:17:45,955
Nothing sir.

1950
02:17:48,896 --> 02:17:49,362
Hey...

1951
02:17:49,564 --> 02:17:50,030
Who's that?

1952
02:17:50,231 --> 02:17:51,198
Can you stop for a minute?

1953
02:17:55,069 --> 02:17:56,866
WiII you frighten to make me stop?

1954
02:17:57,572 --> 02:18:01,030
You've come to visit
Shikari Sambu unexpectedIy.

1955
02:18:01,242 --> 02:18:04,473
I've read in the papers that
you've kiIIed a person.

1956
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:11,882
Events happening in CID Moossa's
crime investigating Iife,

1957
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:13,544
are just a measure of arts.

1958
02:18:14,255 --> 02:18:15,381
This is just a trifIe murder.

1959
02:18:15,590 --> 02:18:17,717
You're going to see big murders.

1960
02:18:18,426 --> 02:18:20,553
Do you know the truth?
Don't teII anybody.

1961
02:18:21,095 --> 02:18:22,722
I'm great.

1962
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:25,558
That dead man was staying in
my house as a paying guest.

1963
02:18:25,767 --> 02:18:26,233
Oh God!

1964
02:18:26,834 --> 02:18:28,995
2 of them who was with
him are missing.

1965
02:18:30,672 --> 02:18:32,333
I've Iodged the compIaint
to the Commissioner.

1966
02:18:32,874 --> 02:18:36,071
Commissioner? What fooIishness
have you done?- What's it?

1967
02:18:36,778 --> 02:18:37,244
Come.

1968
02:18:37,445 --> 02:18:40,414
Leave him, he's innocent.

1969
02:18:40,615 --> 02:18:42,583
Hey Put him into the van. Fast.

1970
02:18:44,552 --> 02:18:45,576
Grandpa.

1971
02:18:47,455 --> 02:18:49,252
You've come at the right time.

1972
02:18:49,457 --> 02:18:52,756
We didn't know that
they were criminaIs.

1973
02:18:53,127 --> 02:18:54,253
Don't harm him.

1974
02:18:54,796 --> 02:18:57,424
I'II not harm him.
Hey, Ieave that oId man.

1975
02:18:57,965 --> 02:18:59,432
You put her into the van.

1976
02:18:59,801 --> 02:19:02,269
Sir, what nonsense is this?
She's innocent.

1977
02:19:04,238 --> 02:19:04,932
Who are you?

1978
02:19:05,807 --> 02:19:08,605
Why are you so soft towards her?

1979
02:19:08,810 --> 02:19:12,405
Love?

1980
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:16,414
You know what's her crime.
She has rescued terrorists.

1981
02:19:16,718 --> 02:19:19,778
Non-baiIabIe offence.
She'II not get baiI.

1982
02:19:20,154 --> 02:19:21,052
Leave me.

1983
02:19:22,490 --> 02:19:27,792
I'm taking away your heart.
Can you reIease it?

1984
02:19:42,677 --> 02:19:44,304
You don't know, right?

1985
02:19:44,846 --> 02:19:47,815
How are you reIated to
those criminaIs? TeII me.

1986
02:19:49,016 --> 02:19:51,985
I don't know anything about them.

1987
02:20:16,878 --> 02:20:24,683
O Iove deviI!
I am some what okay.

1988
02:20:31,058 --> 02:20:36,860
Are you Moossa's girI?
You Iook very beautifuI.

1989
02:20:39,233 --> 02:20:42,361
ShaII I see your beauty?

1990
02:20:54,582 --> 02:20:55,241
Who's that?

1991
02:23:20,561 --> 02:23:22,358
I Iove you.

1992
02:23:24,565 --> 02:23:25,862
You Iove me?

1993
02:23:26,901 --> 02:23:29,199
You Iove me?

1994
02:23:52,259 --> 02:23:55,558
Let the meIodious breeze sway.

1995
02:23:55,763 --> 02:23:57,230
Let the rain drops pour.

1996
02:23:57,598 --> 02:23:59,566
Let the thunder and Iightning strike.

1997
02:24:07,274 --> 02:24:10,903
When winter faIIs, fIies wiII
cover the entire town.

1998
02:24:11,112 --> 02:24:14,411
You're the moon seen cIearIy
in the dreams of mirror.

1999
02:24:14,782 --> 02:24:20,084
Aren't you the star I kiss?

2000
02:25:23,017 --> 02:25:24,985
O ApriI IiIy fIower.

2001
02:25:25,386 --> 02:25:29,686
ShaII I turn into downy-bed on you?

2002
02:25:30,191 --> 02:25:37,154
You're the chiIIness of cIoud,
I'II cover you with my sari.

2003
02:25:37,698 --> 02:25:40,997
O dear! O beIoved!

2004
02:25:41,368 --> 02:25:44,496
A paIace in the moon
under the mist.

2005
02:25:45,039 --> 02:25:48,338
Don't Iook at me!
Don't utter a word!

2006
02:25:48,709 --> 02:25:53,669
I'm the Iime stone, I'II break
into pieces if you touch me.

2007
02:26:53,440 --> 02:27:00,243
When I see you, bIue fIames
go up in my eyes.

2008
02:27:00,781 --> 02:27:03,079
When I Iie on your shouIder,

2009
02:27:03,284 --> 02:27:07,584
I heard the ticking tune
in my breathe.

2010
02:27:08,455 --> 02:27:11,083
O PearI! Don't cover yourseIf.

2011
02:27:11,959 --> 02:27:15,087
ShaII I add hues to
your fIowery Iips?

2012
02:27:15,629 --> 02:27:18,757
Oh My beIoved! Aren't you my kannan?

2013
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:24,932
Isn't it the humming song
which somebody sings at night?

2014
02:27:41,155 --> 02:27:44,124
Sir, it seems he has Iink
with a major terror gang.

2015
02:27:44,358 --> 02:27:47,452
To cheat poIice as weII as
to gain the pubIic support.

2016
02:27:47,661 --> 02:27:50,630
He runs the detective agency,
says the FIR.

2017
02:27:50,998 --> 02:27:54,126
Sir, he's very dangerous criminaI.

2018
02:27:54,668 --> 02:27:56,135
You've to give us
shoot at sight order.

2019
02:27:56,337 --> 02:27:59,135
An order to kiII a suspect man.

2020
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:03,141
Don't utiIise this chance to
take revenge on him.- Revenge.

2021
02:28:03,777 --> 02:28:05,972
Sir, since you peopIe are
affectionate on him.

2022
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,807
He has become more stiff necked.

2023
02:28:08,015 --> 02:28:11,815
He beat me in the station
and kidnapped that girI.

2024
02:28:12,019 --> 02:28:16,422
As a rebeI, if I can't do anything.
Why am I poIice then?

2025
02:28:16,624 --> 02:28:17,556
Send away.

2026
02:28:17,758 --> 02:28:19,487
Mr. Gowri, don't get emotionaI.

2027
02:28:19,693 --> 02:28:23,151
I'm very sorry.
But I'm emotionaI.

2028
02:28:23,530 --> 02:28:26,158
I've worn this cap
for 15 yrs.

2029
02:28:26,533 --> 02:28:29,161
I'm sincere to this cap.

2030
02:28:29,370 --> 02:28:30,337
DIG, what's your opinion?

2031
02:28:30,537 --> 02:28:33,836
Sir, I don't beIieve he has any
Iink with the terrorist gang.

2032
02:28:34,041 --> 02:28:37,340
But the way he reacted
now is a crime.

2033
02:28:37,544 --> 02:28:39,341
It's a crime, right?
You've agreed haven't you?

2034
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:42,508
Sir, we've to arrest him.
PIease issue the order.

2035
02:28:43,217 --> 02:28:45,515
Yes, you carry on.

2036
02:29:26,593 --> 02:29:28,390
I wiII come out of the jaiI.

2037
02:29:29,263 --> 02:29:32,892
My next target wiII be you.
Remember it.

2038
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:36,228
Remember it.

2039
02:29:51,618 --> 02:29:52,915
Chief Minister is here onIy.

2040
02:29:56,056 --> 02:29:58,923
Hey...Iet's frighten the
poIicemen by bursting crackers.

2041
02:29:59,126 --> 02:30:00,923
I'II make them frighten in
the way they do shit here.

2042
02:30:01,128 --> 02:30:02,425
Just frighten them.
Don't make them shit.

2043
02:30:02,629 --> 02:30:05,757
Sahadeva, set fire to it's taiI.
- Turning me to a Hanuman?

2044
02:30:06,567 --> 02:30:09,263
Yes, you've to burn down this
entire Lanka into ashes.

2045
02:30:09,470 --> 02:30:09,936
Got it.

2046
02:30:10,137 --> 02:30:12,435
Then, set fire to my taiI.
QuickIy.

2047
02:30:13,974 --> 02:30:16,772
If you die in the crackers,
wiII you forget us?

2048
02:30:17,144 --> 02:30:19,612
I'II not forget even if I die.
Set fire before it starts raining.

2049
02:30:19,813 --> 02:30:21,280
I'm in a hurry to reach Lanka.

2050
02:30:29,490 --> 02:30:30,457
Come on...Catch him.

2051
02:30:44,505 --> 02:30:44,971
Sir.

2052
02:30:47,674 --> 02:30:49,642
How come you're here?

2053
02:30:50,344 --> 02:30:52,812
Sir, I want to teII you a truth.

2054
02:30:53,013 --> 02:30:55,641
That you're innocent, right?
I know that.

2055
02:30:55,849 --> 02:30:58,317
I was eager to meet you.

2056
02:30:58,519 --> 02:30:58,985
Why?

2057
02:30:59,186 --> 02:31:01,313
I saw him. God of death.

2058
02:31:02,022 --> 02:31:04,718
KaIik Muhammad aIias Baba.
Terrorist Ieader.

2059
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:08,250
I didn't commit any mistake.

2060
02:31:08,862 --> 02:31:11,160
When I ordered to
finish the terrorists,

2061
02:31:11,365 --> 02:31:16,496
I never expected that their
famiIies wouId aIso suffer.

2062
02:31:17,371 --> 02:31:20,829
Then their terrorism wasn't
towards the government.

2063
02:31:21,041 --> 02:31:22,008
But with me.

2064
02:31:22,643 --> 02:31:25,737
I had to pay a heavy price for it.

2065
02:31:26,480 --> 02:31:28,744
To get Baba reIeased from the jaiI,

2066
02:31:29,149 --> 02:31:32,016
his men had kidnapped
my younger daughter.

2067
02:31:32,219 --> 02:31:34,187
When they threatened to kiII her,

2068
02:31:34,388 --> 02:31:35,514
I didn't mind it.

2069
02:31:37,558 --> 02:31:40,527
I Ioved my country more
than my daughter.

2070
02:31:40,961 --> 02:31:43,429
They kiIIed my dearest daughter.

2071
02:31:44,965 --> 02:31:48,765
I don't mind Iosing my Iife
for this country.

2072
02:31:49,503 --> 02:31:52,529
But I've to get my eIder
daughter married.

2073
02:31:53,407 --> 02:31:56,035
I've to Iive untiI then.

2074
02:32:19,766 --> 02:32:21,233
Have you kiIIed him?- No.

2075
02:32:21,602 --> 02:32:22,569
That rascaI Moossa is there.

2076
02:32:40,120 --> 02:32:43,749
Moossa has shot the Minister
and he's taking him away.

2077
02:32:43,957 --> 02:32:44,582
FoIIow him.

2078
02:32:47,794 --> 02:32:48,761
We're there.

2079
02:32:50,297 --> 02:32:51,764
Get in.- Don't go.

2080
02:32:53,967 --> 02:32:57,767
I've not got in.- Come...

2081
02:32:57,971 --> 02:32:58,938
If I get a fIight.

2082
02:32:59,139 --> 02:33:00,606
CycIe is here.
Let me take that then.

2083
02:33:03,310 --> 02:33:04,937
Stop there. I wiII come.

2084
02:33:09,483 --> 02:33:11,781
Now there are 2 criminaIs in the Iist
who I am not abIe to catch.

2085
02:33:13,153 --> 02:33:16,281
Vikram brother, come fast.
- Then come and push me.

2086
02:33:16,490 --> 02:33:17,457
Then, you come sIowIy.

2087
02:33:17,658 --> 02:33:20,126
I've got the 2 criminaIs
at the same time.

2088
02:33:20,327 --> 02:33:22,124
Stop it. You're under arrest.

2089
02:33:23,764 --> 02:33:24,458
Take the jeep.

2090
02:33:24,665 --> 02:33:26,633
WiII it get repaired
atIeast this year?

2091
02:33:27,834 --> 02:33:29,461
I can catch them
if I foIIow him.

2092
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:33,629
AtIeast one feet before the running dog.
I just said a proverb.

2093
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:34,807
Hey Dog.- Hey.

2094
02:33:35,175 --> 02:33:35,800
Not you.

2095
02:33:36,009 --> 02:33:38,807
Vikram brother, throw that
cycIe and catch an auto.

2096
02:33:39,012 --> 02:33:40,639
WiII your father pay
the auto fare?

2097
02:33:47,187 --> 02:33:48,654
''LET'S GIVE HIM SOME WORK''.

2098
02:33:58,465 --> 02:33:59,489
Greetings Chief Minister.

2099
02:34:05,205 --> 02:34:06,570
Sahadeva, drive at fuII speed.

2100
02:34:06,773 --> 02:34:08,673
Sitting here wiII
not work out. I'II move to the front.

2101
02:34:14,881 --> 02:34:15,677
Be quiet.

2102
02:34:16,216 --> 02:34:17,683
Let's work with this.

2103
02:34:18,552 --> 02:34:20,679
This is the appIication of eggs.

2104
02:34:20,988 --> 02:34:22,683
Eggs...throw at them.

2105
02:34:23,724 --> 02:34:26,352
May the eviI eyes be warded away.

2106
02:34:28,295 --> 02:34:30,058
Don't get worried,
you keep driving.

2107
02:34:31,265 --> 02:34:32,926
Show me your head.

2108
02:34:37,404 --> 02:34:39,031
This is the Iast punch.
Who's the Iucky man?

Take it.

2113
02:35:04,064 --> 02:35:07,056
You look straight and drive
or else we'll lose our plates.

2114
02:35:08,935 --> 02:35:10,960
Those who didn't get the pIates
come forward.

2115
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:13,802
Sahadev, did you see?

2116
02:35:15,075 --> 02:35:16,633
He's making ice cream into a paste.

2117
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:19,601
Don't come near us.

2118
02:35:25,185 --> 02:35:25,810
Oh God!

2119
02:35:26,286 --> 02:35:28,117
What's it? Where are your bikes?

2120
02:35:29,122 --> 02:35:30,646
Sahadev, did you take the car?

2121
02:35:31,391 --> 02:35:32,915
Oh My god, car is gone.

2122
02:35:35,395 --> 02:35:36,521
Wow! I ride cycIe weII.

2123
02:35:39,466 --> 02:35:40,091
Move...

2124
02:35:44,104 --> 02:35:45,435
HeIIo, stop this tricycIe.

2125
02:35:56,917 --> 02:35:58,612
Who's kidnapping my wife?

2126
02:35:58,819 --> 02:36:02,778
Oh no! Don't hit me.

2127
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:16,200
Oh! God.

2128
02:36:21,308 --> 02:36:22,138
Are you resting?

2129
02:36:22,809 --> 02:36:24,868
You do that Iater, run...

2134
02:37:05,986 --> 02:37:06,611
Oh God!

2135
02:37:25,439 --> 02:37:26,463
What if I cover them with smoke?

2136
02:37:57,637 --> 02:38:00,231
He Iacks chiIIy powder.

2137
02:38:20,126 --> 02:38:20,751
Oh God!

2138
02:38:28,502 --> 02:38:29,594
Why don't I give them some oiI?

2139
02:39:07,507 --> 02:39:09,304
This poIice man....Hey come fast.

2140

Throw the gun.

2142
02:41:07,761 --> 02:41:08,659
Throw the gun.

2143
02:41:24,044 --> 02:41:27,605
CID Moossa.

2144
02:41:29,115 --> 02:41:31,447
Hey MooIa, watch.

2145
02:41:31,751 --> 02:41:38,520
Look, our Chief Minister.
- KeraIa Chief Minister, Iion of South.

2146
02:41:39,859 --> 02:41:41,121
Want to rescue him?

2147
02:41:42,629 --> 02:41:43,789
Can you rescue him?

2148
02:41:51,671 --> 02:41:53,730
''Over! It's going to coIIapse''.

2149
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:56,968
What has happened to him?
Is he Iaughing at us?

2150
02:41:59,012 --> 02:42:00,707
Commissioner, the great.

2151
02:42:01,181 --> 02:42:03,149
Baba! The tiger of the North.

2152
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:11,650
He hasn't gone mad, has he?

2153
02:42:38,918 --> 02:42:40,010
Use my gun.- Thank you.

2154
02:43:05,078 --> 02:43:05,874
Hi MooIam.

2155
02:43:09,883 --> 02:43:10,872
Yes, Moossa.

2156
02:43:11,951 --> 02:43:12,975
I am your friend.

2157
02:43:18,024 --> 02:43:21,892
Hey no...

2158
02:43:41,614 --> 02:43:43,241
Don't run...- I wiII not.

2159
02:43:48,988 --> 02:43:51,582
Sahadeva, what's aII this?

2160
02:43:56,362 --> 02:43:57,522
Just a parade sir.

2161
02:44:10,143 --> 02:44:12,270
OH GOD, EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

2162
02:44:12,812 --> 02:44:16,942
ClD Moossa who adventurously

02:44:17,383 --> 02:44:18,941
to learn new techniques.

2164
02:44:19,152 --> 02:44:21,484
Kerala Government has sent
him to Scotland.

2165
02:44:36,669 --> 02:44:38,660
Arjun, be carefuI.
It's an airpIane.

02:44:46,613 --> 02:44:47,375
Then, shaII we move?

02:44:48,281 --> 02:44:48,804
Okay.

2168
02:44:52,385 --> 02:44:54,478
A person has to get down.

2169
02:44:54,687 --> 02:44:56,154
AeropIane is taking off.

2170
02:44:56,356 --> 02:44:58,654
I'II get you down at AIwaye
for the rest of the things.

Oh God! Mad man.
