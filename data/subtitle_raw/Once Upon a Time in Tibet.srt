1
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,686
This is it?

2
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,895
Yeah, sir.

3
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,147
You are calling
that piece of shit a plane?

4
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,274
Yes, sir.

5
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,317
It can fly over Mountain Everest, sir.

6
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,777
It can fly over Mountain Everest?

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,737
What? Are you kidding?

8
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,205
Luosang.

9
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,290
Come back here!

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,916
- Stay awayfrom that witch.
- Stop!

11
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,751
- Get him back here.
- Stop!

12
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,670
Don't run.

13
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,921
Let go of me.

14
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,423
- Let go of me.
- Go back.

15
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,424
Go back!

16
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,468
- Let go of me.
- Go back.

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,345
Let me go.

18
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,097
Don't you ever go near her tent again.

19
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,685
- I told you she will jinx you.
- Get back.

20
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,687
Let me go, let me go.

21
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,577
Witch.

22
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,953
- Witch.
- Witch.

23
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,997
- Witch.
- Witch.

24
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,416
Witch.

25
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,341
Witch.

26
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,513
The witch is here. Quickly! Run!

27
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,265
I told you to stay away from that tent.

28
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,975
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

29
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,186
Go home now!

30
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,813
Orthe devil will come.

31
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,783
Yongcuo.

32
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,497
Yongcuo.

33
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,750
You are so beautiful.

34
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,763
Yongcuo.

35
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,182
Here, take the meat.

36
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,060
Eat, Yongcuo.

37
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,937
And this.

38
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,067
Yongcuo, and this lamb too.

39
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:09,159
Yongcuo.
Can I be the child's father?

40
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,828
Can I, Yongcuo?

41
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,751
Yongcuo, don't you want it?

42
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,712
- Luosang!
- Here you go.

43
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,797
- Get back here.
- Take it.

44
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,925
You can't go there.
You should watch out that witch.

45
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,950
Who's there?

46
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,078
Hello?

47
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,703
I saw the devil by the lake.

48
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,039
Over there.

49
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,209
Here comes Grandpa Danzeng.

50
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,799
Devil! He must be the Devil!

51
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,094
He is no devil. He's a foreigner.

52
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,513
I saw them once in India
when I was young.

53
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,688
He's still alive.

54
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:26,815
The British.

55
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,902
The damn British are here again.

56
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,073
What should we do?
Where can we hide him?

57
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,452
This is the only way out.

58
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,677
Grandpa Danzeng.

59
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,428
He is either the devil...

60
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,764
...or coming out of the snow,

61
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,349
or falling from the sky.

62
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,601
Ask him yourself when he's awake.

63
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,403
Come here Yongcuo, quickly!

64
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,245
Here, give me your hand.

65
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,040
Don't go. You gotta help me here.

66
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,960
I only have one pair of hands.

67
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,548
Yes that's it.

68
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,551
Rub gently just like
the way you spin the Prayer Wheel.

69
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,388
Do it until his skin gets
as hot as fresh cow muck.

70
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,407
Oh, my head hurts like hell.

71
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,202
You owe me three sheep.

72
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,039
Two.

73
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,213
We are 26 degrees off
from our original course.

74
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,465
I am trying to recalibrate
the navigation system.

75
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,342
It's not responding!

76
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,555
We are falling fast!

77
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,352
Now! Now! Now!

78
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,041
Huang, help me!
I can't move this one.

79
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Robert.

80
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,970
Get a hold of yourself.
We are going to be joining him very soon.

81
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:13,018
Grab a parachute
and jump out of the plane.

82
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,645
This is yours.

83
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,399
Goodbye, buddy. Good luck!

84
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,276
What? You...

85
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,489
Ouraltitude is already
too low to parachute. Jump!

86
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,740
Don't be stupid, Jack.

87
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:32,454
One... Two... Three.

88
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,544
Don't touch my stuff.

89
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,549
Where am I?

90
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,468
You still owe me two sheep.

91
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:07,030
This man's eyes
have seen too much filth.

92
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,990
They could be easily
damaged by the snow.

93
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,285
We can treat his eyes using your breast
milkwith the medicine I have blessed.

94
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,954
Then he could be cured.

95
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,956
My breast milk is for my child.

96
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:23,380
Here's the medicine; give me two sheep.

97
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,467
Two! You can't afford it, can you?

98
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,344
Poor Yongcuo.

99
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,151
What are you doing?

100
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,278
What are you doing?

101
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,720
Excuse me, sir.

102
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,847
You don't have any identification,

103
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,516
so this is an illegal immigration.

104
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,767
And who are you, sir?

105
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,562
I am a special officer,
SuoLang Wangdui.

106
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,356
This is Major Sun.

107
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,776
But, butwe can't
stay in a place like this.

108
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,071
We just want to go home,
we want to go home to our home countries.

109
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,450
Sorry. Here is not neutral in the war.

110
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,285
You are in the land of China.

111
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,372
A country that's hostile
against your countries.

112
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,917
Where are you sending us?

113
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,171
Unfortunately you have to go
back to where you came from.

114
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,132
No, no! Please don't send us back.

115
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,637
You can't send us back.

116
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,265
Please, sir. I beg you.
It will be inhuman.

117
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,435
I'd rather die, please,
I can't go back there.

118
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:10,231
I can't go back there.

119
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:13,902
Good job.

120
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,945
- Return to your own tribes.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,302
Jiangcuo.

122
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,596
Yangjin.

123
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,269
You are great.
Everyone is praising your bravery...

124
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,688
...for capturing so many
red haired devils this time.

125
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,732
Those red haired
devils aren't real devils.

126
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,443
They just wanted to go home
but ended up in the wrong place.

127
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,949
Does it still hurt?

128
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,080
In a few days,

129
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,500
I will be returning
to the tribe with Madam.

130
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,504
Be sure to drop by and visit me,
Jiangcuo.

131
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,092
Yangjin.

132
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:26,433
The Chief wouldn't let me see you
when I go back.

133
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,103
I would be locked up in a hut to tan hides.

134
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:37,152
I will be satisfied if I could just
get a glimpse of you from afar.

135
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,488
Yangjin.

136
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:59,317
I can see! I can see!

137
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,322
I can see!

138
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,007
So this is you. You are very beautiful.

139
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,304
Where'd your beard go?

140
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,390
Yeah. I can see.

141
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,474
You can see now?

142
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,725
I can see.

143
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,905
Sorry for the trouble.

144
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,954
Thank you for curing my eyes.

145
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,044
Can I help you? I can help you.

146
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,150
- Witch.
- Witch.

147
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:28,573
Red haired devil.

148
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,284
- Witch.
- Witch.

149
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,952
- What's happening?
- Get inside.

150
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,954
What are they doing here?

151
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,460
The witch brought
the red haired devil here.

152
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,420
Move! Move!

153
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,134
- Away from her.
- Away from her.

154
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,820
Thank you forsaving me.

155
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,035
I'm very honored to be here with you.

156
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,333
I'm an American.

157
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,253
I need to get to Lhasa.

158
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,675
Lhasa?

159
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,136
Lhasa.

160
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,805
He wants to go to Lhasa?

161
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,932
Chief, he wants to go to Lhasa.

162
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,308
This can't be done.

163
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,310
You want to go to Lhasa?

164
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,438
Lhasa.

165
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,942
Can you? you can take me to Lhasa?

166
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:03,209
This is the order issued by the Dalai Lama
under the authority of the Qing Emperor...

167
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,587
...that forbids foreigners from
trespassing into the sacred Tibet.

168
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,800
Forty years ago,

169
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,636
you British raided Tibet,

170
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,680
murdered countless our people,

171
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,142
and even plundered the most
sacred treasures of our religion.

172
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,228
You should not even be here.
Go! Leave now!

173
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,739
This is a waste oftime.

174
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,471
- You can't leave now. You can't go.
- I have to go.

175
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,681
- The snow will seal the mountain off soon.
- I am a military officer.

176
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,601
- You can't go. You can't.
- I can't stay here. I can't stay here.

177
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,812
Thank you.

178
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,153
Chief, look!
The red haired devil is leaving.

179
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,660
Do you think he could make it
crossing the snow mountain?

180
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,957
No one can cross
that mountain in this season.

181
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,169
Lord Constable,

182
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,713
the shepherd reported that
a red haired devil murdered a woman.

183
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,881
Where did this happen?

184
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,551
The tribe of Kaluo.

185
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,013
Have you heard of it?

186
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,723
A red haired devil killed one ofus.

187
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:27,061
So I've heared. The government's
people are hunting him down.

188
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,566
Our tribe would rather
pay more taxes as a penalty...

189
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,026
...than having more people drafted
to serve the government.

190
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,571
- Master.
- Master.

191
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,117
What's the name of your slave again?

192
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,919
Is she your woman?

193
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:58,050
I'm waiting for the Chief's
permission to marry her.

194
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,057
Find me the foreign murderer,

195
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,268
then you will redeem your freedom,

196
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,270
and marry that woman.

197
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:18,779
Lord Constable,
thank you so much. Thank you.

198
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,743
You could get up now.

199
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,623
Yes.

200
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,834
Lord Constable,

201
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,878
I vow to bring him back...

202
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,005
...even if it will cost my life.

203
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,174
Go.

204
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,936
Let's go.

205
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,708
Grandpa Danzeng,
please save him. Please.

206
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,085
What's wrong? Let me see.

207
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:10,224
Yongcuo, your child's gone.
He didn't like it here.

208
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,551
This place is too poor.

209
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,512
There's no temple, no Lamas.

210
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:58,392
Even Buddha drifting pass here
would refuse to stay.

211
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:05,065
The Buddha will bless you
as long as you believe in Him.

212
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,027
Will the Buddha bless my child too?

213
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,989
Buddha bless all.

214
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,238
- The bandits are here. Run!
- The bandits are here.

215
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,707
Don't be afraid.
The government sent us here.

216
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,294
Hey! Get back here.

217
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,175
Please eat.
The journey must have been exhausting.

218
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,094
It must have been exhausting.

219
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:27,815
Jiangcuo.

220
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,527
Yangjin, what brought you here?
Let's go.

221
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,242
You guys moved as fast as the wind.

222
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,077
It took me days to catch you up.

223
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,379
Yangjin,

224
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,215
when I get the red haired devil this time,

225
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,551
we can stay together forever.

226
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,344
Really?

227
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,149
May the Buddha bless you.

228
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,326
Yangjin, wait for me.

229
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,830
I'll wait for you.

230
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,696
I can't go.
I can't get through. It's too cold.

231
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,991
So cold.

232
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,792
The path is too cold.

233
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,836
Can't get anything through it.

234
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,603
Where's your kid?

235
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,907
I am sorry.

236
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,076
Don't touch me.

237
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,453
I'll bring bad luck to you.

238
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,559
I know this is hard,

239
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,856
but it's not going to be the last
hardship you are facing in your life.

240
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,746
There, there.

241
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,875
It's my mom.

242
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,627
My mom.

243
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,214
Mama!

244
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,592
Mama.

245
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,554
My mom loves me very much.

246
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,184
When I signed up for the military
and went away to war,

247
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,772
she was worried
that I was going to get killed.

248
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,403
That's the sadness
that I never want my mom to feel.

249
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,034
I'd imagine that your son in heaven...

250
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,037
...wouldn't want you
to feel that either.

251
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,500
This must be the fairy's clothes.

252
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,710
It's so pretty.

253
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,973
Her name is Lisa.

254
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,480
My dad was a military man.

255
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,276
I think when I joined the military too,

256
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,823
it just gives her another
life to have to worry about.

257
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,080
I am still alive.

258
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,321
Big guy! Big guy!

259
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,406
What are you doing here?

260
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,078
This is how we greet
each other around here.

261
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,461
Let's sit down. Please sit.

262
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,841
I've got something tasty.
See, this is for you. Eat.

263
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,720
Eat. Help yourself.

264
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,306
It is delicious.

265
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,935
Good.

266
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,022
Is it good?

267
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,399
One day Yongcuo's
husband went to shepherd...

268
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,109
...and was killed by a falling rock.

269
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,445
On the very night, one of her sheep returned
with the thigh of a wolf in its mouth.

270
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,530
A lama from Lhasa declared that...

271
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,327
...Yongcuo is a witch
who has been cursed.

272
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,703
I am afraid of no witch.

273
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,288
Hey. Do you understand
what I am telling you?

274
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,415
You still don't know
what I am talking about.

275
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,626
This is Yongcuo, this is me.

276
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,295
And this is you, big guy.

277
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,048
We can both marry Yongcuo.
What do you think?

278
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,759
No?

279
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,720
Come on, let's both marry her as our wife.

280
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,432
- Okay.
- You agreed? Yes?

281
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,686
That's great. This is great.
Let's go, big guy.

282
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,105
- Robert.
- Lo Bu?

283
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,314
Robert.

284
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,732
Lobu. Lobu.

285
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,359
Robert.

286
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,278
Lobu. Lobu. Lobu.

287
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,407
What's her name?

288
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,659
Her name is Yongcuo.

289
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:36,827
Yongcuo?

290
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,620
She is my woman. Mine!

291
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,622
- Yongcuo?
- Yes, Yongcuo.

292
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,748
Yongcuo.

293
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,464
Yongcuo.

294
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,470
Yongcuo.

295
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,563
Robert.

296
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,941
Robert.

297
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,404
Lobu?

298
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,706
Chief, Where do you suppose
the red haired devil could be hiding?

299
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,375
It's been so long.

300
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,669
I think he might
have easily starved to death.

301
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,840
Even ifhe's dead,
I have to take his corpse back.

302
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,342
If he did try to cross
that snow mountain,

303
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,678
we won't even be able to
find his dead body.

304
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,296
Take it.

305
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,636
Can I exchange the pot
for your cloth?

306
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,263
You have quite the eye.

307
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,682
This cloth is the latest
merchandise from India.

308
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,267
Thank you.

309
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,708
Where did you find him?

310
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,753
My lord, it was on the way to
the Sacred Moutain of Danla.

311
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,132
This is an American pilot.

312
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,758
Send a telegram to Lhasa immediately.

313
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:57,968
Yes, my lord.

314
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,228
That's a plane.

315
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,354
You hear it?

316
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:57,235
Jack! Hey! It's got to be Jack!
He's looking for me. Huh?

317
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:01,573
Jack, Jack, Jack.

318
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,538
Here, Robert. Here you are.

319
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,261
OK.

320
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,847
Is this enough?

321
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,098
Okay.

322
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,308
I'll get some more.

323
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,569
Luosang, what are you doing?

324
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,448
We are gathering stones...

325
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,660
...to catch the attention of
the big bird in the sky.

326
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,079
Do you know what that is?

327
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,885
Robert, why hasn't
the big bird come this way?

328
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,682
Big bird! Come this way now, please!

329
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,768
Fly this way!

330
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,760
Go. Go. Go.

331
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,182
Why here? Jesus!

332
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,895
It's my signal!

333
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,648
Fuck!

334
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,781
That's great! Yeah?
What are you doing?

335
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,285
Where's my bag?

336
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:02,170
There were a lot of people here.
Take my bag?

337
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,927
This, this is my bag.

338
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,763
You don't touch my bag!

339
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:26,903
This is clothes?

340
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,708
Yongcuo.

341
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,919
Your shepherd is herding your
sheep by the lake.

342
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,631
Go take a look. Go.

343
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,342
You made a dress.

344
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,181
It's beautiful.

345
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:40,948
Give me this hand.

346
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,117
It's okay.

347
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,244
It's okay.

348
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:48,998
Put it here.

349
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,376
There you go.

350
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:43,678
Here. Give me your hands.

351
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,468
We have finally made it
across Mount Qiongbala.

352
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,973
Boss, which way should we take?

353
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,683
This way leads us to Saiba Tribe.

354
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,435
That one takes us to Sangguozi.

355
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,771
Sangguozi.

356
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,064
Let's go.

357
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,905
Yongcuo! Yongcuo!

358
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:07,632
I heard some herders are searching
for the foreigner for the government.

359
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,052
It seems he had killed someone.

360
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,221
Hide your shepherd quickly.

361
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:20,311
What would happen if they come here
and find Robert?

362
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,733
If they find yourshepherd,

363
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:29,111
he would be squashed like a bug.

364
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,239
Go!

365
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,310
Kids!

366
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,728
Hi!

367
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,230
Have you seen any red haired devil?

368
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,358
- Yes. There.
- Yes. There.

369
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,529
I have confirmed it.

370
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,031
This man is the American pilot
we are looking for.

371
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,741
Ma.

372
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:16,951
Yes.

373
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,790
Please distribute this to
all shepherds in the area.

374
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,459
If you find anyone with this insignia,

375
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,211
inform me immediately.

376
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,798
There was indeed a foreigner
near the tribe of Sangguozi.

377
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,341
I was informed of that.

378
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,759
But I heard he killed someone.

379
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,307
Unless you have confirmed the story,

380
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,893
otherwise I want you to do everything
in your power to rescue this man.

381
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,311
I will.

382
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,315
Yongcuo.

383
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,443
Are you okay?

384
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,278
Yongcuo, what are you doing?

385
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:10,921
Go Go.

386
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,508
Yongcuo.

387
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,343
Go. Go.

388
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,095
Chief, look!

389
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,494
Boss. It's the red haired devil.

390
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:45,956
Lobu.

391
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:47,333
Yeah, what?

392
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,293
What?

393
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,343
- May the Buddha bless you.
- What is this?

394
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,261
Leave, now!

395
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,389
Go!

396
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:05,643
Get on the horse?

397
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,982
Go, now! Go!

398
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,943
What do you want me to do?
I don't understand.

399
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,694
Go, now! Go!

400
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,322
What? What are you...

401
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:23,994
Go, now! Go!

402
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,830
Yongcuo, you come with me.

403
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,583
Yongcuo!

404
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,046
Stop right there! Don't you move!

405
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,215
- Stop right there!
- Don't you move!

406
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,050
Freeze! Don't you move!

407
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,136
I'll shoot if you keep running.

408
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,345
Don't you move!

409
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,773
Stop right here!

410
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:53,941
Don't you move!

411
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,401
What? Okay. What!

412
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,448
Stop running. Take him away.
Fast! Keep going!

413
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,201
Let's go. Come with us.

414
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,028
Is this the murderer?

415
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,198
It took us a long time...

416
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,283
...to catch this man.

417
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,831
He's the murderer.

418
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,751
You said murderer?
You can speak English?

419
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,963
Don't play game with me.

420
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,634
Do you understand?
I can speak English. You understand?

421
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,761
Yeah. I understand.

422
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,388
Just please tell me.

423
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,224
I tell you.

424
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,559
That night you killed a woman.

425
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,605
So many people
saw your face very clearly.

426
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:20,194
Now everyone is going to look for you.

427
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:23,989
There, the notice is very clear.

428
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,576
Dave, tell him what the notice says.

429
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,871
If the murderer is still breathing,
he should be caught alive;

430
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,290
If he is dead,
his dead body shoule be found.

431
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,334
Woah. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on.

432
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,794
You're saying I killed a woman?

433
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,712
It's impossible.

434
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,215
I'm a United States military officer.

435
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,051
I'm not a god-damn killer!

436
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,976
I need you to translate this for me,
alright? As clearly as you can.

437
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:58,065
Okay? I need you to translate this.
Word forword, Okay? Okay?

438
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,693
Boss.

439
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,029
My name is Robert.

440
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:12,288
I'm a United States 14th Air Force
Second Officer Pilot.

441
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,169
Get up! Please get up! Get up!

442
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,422
Just one sentence.

443
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,007
- Go.
- Just one sentence.

444
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:28,637
One sentence. Just one sentence.

445
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,236
My jacket.

446
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,117
Look!

447
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,496
- Take a look at this.
- Let me try it on.

448
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,999
- I saw it first.
- Give it to me.

449
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,146
I need the jacket.
It's my proof; It's who I am.

450
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,315
I am not your murderer.

451
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:05,234
You got the wrong guy.

452
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:09,988
Kedi.

453
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,677
Boss, have some more.

454
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,625
Boss, Wangdan is too ill to continue.

455
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,672
Kedi, take these men back with you.

456
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,216
No. I am following you.

457
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,885
Wherever you go I'll go with you.

458
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,139
Fatty, take him back with you.

459
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,807
Alright.

460
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,190
Let's go.

461
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,540
Kedi.

462
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:24,039
May the Buddha bless you.

463
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,963
Boss. The red haired devil is dangerous.

464
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,632
Why not finish him off here?

465
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,804
Go to sleep.

466
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,107
Now, you should be on your way home.

467
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,736
Go! Go!

468
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:43,321
I just wanted to kill him for you.

469
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,074
So you could be free.

470
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:50,328
You want me to leave? Fine.

471
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:24,172
Why didn't those people say a word?

472
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,882
They have taken the Vow of Silence.

473
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,969
They won't talk on their pilgrimage.

474
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,504
It was you that took Robert away
the other day.

475
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,923
Where's he now?

476
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,554
Him?

477
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,683
He's already dead.

478
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:24,524
He is not a murderer.

479
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:31,197
He didn't kill anyone.

480
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:42,584
Every night before he slept, he would
stare at the talisman that you gave him.

481
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:40,613
Lobu.

482
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,502
Lobu.

483
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,049
Lobu.

484
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,140
Lobu.

485
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,311
Yongcuo.

486
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,822
Lobu.

487
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,702
Yongcuo.

488
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,083
Lobu.

489
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,215
Yongcuo.

490
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,511
Lobu.

491
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,056
Yongcuo.

492
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,185
Don't move!

493
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:56,189
Lobu.

494
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,525
What are you doing here?

495
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,820
British?

496
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:04,989
American;

497
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,200
Robert;

498
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,453
United States Air Force.

499
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,666
Patrick, Italian;

500
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,377
North Africa Force.

501
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:22,215
I got shot.

502
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,636
You okay? You okay?

503
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,514
I think I'm dying.

504
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,849
You stay. I am going to get water, okay?

505
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,232
Lobu.

506
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,741
My child, you have broken
the Vow of Silence.

507
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,451
And you will be punished for that.

508
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,390
The gun is not loaded.
Don't worry, okay?

509
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,854
What happened to you?
How did you get here?

510
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:25,737
I was in a prisoner camp.
German prisoner camp in India.

511
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:31,284
And I escaped, came here.

512
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,455
Help! A thief!

513
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,999
No. No. No.

514
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,003
The red haired devil has killed someone!

515
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,921
The red haired devil
has killed someone! Get him!

516
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:47,050
Someone come here! Get him!

517
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:48,551
You killed the woman?

518
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:49,719
Yeah, yeah!

519
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,267
I didn't want to kill anybody.

520
01:20:57,978 --> 01:20:59,312
I didn't want to, but...

521
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,149
It's okay.

522
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:06,361
But the woman was...

523
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,577
Here, have some water.

524
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,290
It's okay.

525
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,754
Hey. Hey. Hey. Patrick.

526
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,424
Patrick.

527
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:32,345
I just want to go home.

528
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,399
Okay.

529
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:48,069
Okay, okay.

530
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,241
Okay. That's okay.

531
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,641
Lord Constable,
please have mercy on me.

532
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,978
I saw the red haired devil.

533
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:06,481
Where's he now?

534
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,567
He escaped.

535
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:15,990
MajorSun.

536
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:19,243
I just received a confirmation
on the plane's crash site.

537
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:21,996
It's to the north of
the Sacred Mountain of Danla.

538
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,791
This year happens to
be the zodiacal year.

539
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,503
It will be crowded with pilgrims.

540
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,714
What's the captain's name
of your search team?

541
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,424
His name is Jiangcuo.

542
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,051
Jiangcuo.

543
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,470
The American is in great danger now.

544
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:39,931
Attention!
Head for the Sacred Mountain!

545
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,288
Look! It's the red haired devil.

546
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,414
He is a murderer.

That's him. Get him.
Don't let him run away.

Hey, big guy.
What are you doing? Let him go.

He's my friend. Stop hitting him.
Don't do this to him.

Do it!

558
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:59,010
Put the gun down, put the gun down.

559
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,553
Watch me! Watch me! Hey!

Jiangcuo.

577
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,378
Yongcuo Yongcuo.

578
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:47,673
No. Hey. Oh God, No!

579
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:50,759
Yongcuo.

580
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:09,653
Yongcuo. Oh God!

581
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,539
You are finally free.

Lobu

583
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:52,154
