1
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,586
- Miss Eady?
- Mr. Christie?

2
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:53,376
Come in, do.

3
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:02,827
Blessed blackout.

4
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,859
Well, we'll have a
nice little cup of tea first,

5
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,910
come in the kitchen it's cozier in there.

6
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,429
Oh, that will be lovely.

7
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:32,882
Well...

8
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:36,369
I, I only just brewed up.

9
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,142
Mrs. Christie is out, is she?

10
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:43,223
She's, she's away,
up in Sheffield at her sister's.

11
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,531
- Oh sit down, Miss Eady do.
- Thank you.

12
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,423
Do you...

13
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:52,546
- you take sugar?
- No thank, no.

14
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,293
Thank you.

15
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:56,934
Well now...

16
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:03,056
- It's been bad, has it? The bronchitis.
- At nights. It's been bad at nights..

17
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:08,841
- Keeps you awake, I daresay?
- Oh yes.

18
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,380
Well, this is the stuff for you, Muriel.

19
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,189
You don't mind if I call you Muriel, did you?

20
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,961
- No.
- No.

21
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,540
It's very good of you
to go to all this trouble.

22
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,029
Oh, not at all.

23
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:24,243
All my doctor does is
keep giving me this cough mixture.

24
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,588
Well, there.

25
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:33,550
- Not many of them know about this stuff.
- Oh, it smells just like friar balsam.

26
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:38,690
Well yes, that's in it, it's a
mixture. What we call a compound.

27
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:40,266
I see.

28
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,818
Now, here is the little mask that goes over
your face.

29
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,598
- Oh, have you finished with your tea?
- Yes, thank you.

30
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:47,599
Fine.

31
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,762
And when it's over your
face you must breathe deeply...

32
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,798
so you take in all the vapors, you see.

33
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:56,278
You may feel...

34
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:58,672
just a bit dizzy.

35
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:04,946
- What's that for?
- Ah, that's the extractor.

36
00:05:05,232 --> 00:05:08,376
It gets rid of what we call
the waste products.

37
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,453
Now then.

38
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:14,059
You put the mask over your face.

39
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,466
Lean you head back.

40
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,375
Lean right back.

41
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,196
Shut your eyes, close your eyes, that's it.

42
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,950
Shut your eyes. Now then.

43
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:26,386
Start your breathing then.
Breathe quite deeply.

44
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:27,975
Breathe.

45
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:30,483
Breathe.

46
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:35,591
- Smells a bit funny Mr. Christie.
- Yes, do you feel a bit dizzy?

47
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:38,026
I do, a bit.

48
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:40,783
Yes, well, that's
all the goodness taking effect.

49
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:45,429
Breathe Muriel, breathe.

50
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,113
No no Muriel, no. Breathe Muriel.

51
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:56,927
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.

52
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:01,152
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

53
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:04,388
Breathe, breathe.

54
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,626
Muriel?

55
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,077
Muriel.

56
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:42,999
Ring the old bell then, shall we?

57
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,667
- Oh, it's not a bad district, is it?
- It's not bad.

58
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:56,653
Come on, come on.

59
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Yes?

60
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:05,493
- We've...
- We come about the flat.

61
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:08,225
To see it?

62
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,752
We just want to look
it over, you know. See if it's suitable.

63
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,712
Yes well, you better come in.

64
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,474
Oh, that's my wife, Mrs. Christie.
They've come about the flat.

65
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:31,846
I'll lead the way.

66
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,477
I'll look after him.

67
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,992
The baby. While you're
looking at the flat, I'll hold him.

68
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,987
He'll be all right with me. What's his name?

69
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,920
- Geraldine.
- She I should say.

70
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,169
Yes.

71
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:08,551
Mr. Kitchener occupies
this floor, it's up one more..

72
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:24,152
- Just the two rooms, is it?
- Yes.

73
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,830
Well, it's not what
we're used to, you understand.

74
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,990
We used to have this
mansion flat overlooking the river.

75
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:33,735
- But we had to move out.
- Tim?

76
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,186
Oh gas, is it?

77
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:39,012
Yes, it works out less of a
expense, that's what we find.

78
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:43,073
Oh well, we're not too worried about the
money, the job I do, we don't have to.

79
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:48,028
- Oh, we'll take it.
- Oh Oh Tim, I don't know.

80
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:52,382
- Oh, do we get use of the garden?
- No.

81
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:56,941
- Well, I mean just to put the baby out.
- Well, I'd like to help you, but...

82
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:00,297
It's a question of the lease.

83
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,864
Once you surrender the right of way, I mean
it can take an act of Parliament these cases.

84
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,189
- Oh Tim, I don't know.
- There's another couple, very keen.

85
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:17,780
- Irish, as a matter of fact.
- No, we'll take it.

86
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,976
Well, you're doing the right thing.

87
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,094
Right, now you and Teddy
can have a nice sleep?

88
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:31,893
There's a good girl.

89
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,625
Now, you have a nice sleep.

90
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,305
- Mr. Christie...
- I thought you might like a...

91
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,636
- you did make me jump.
- A little cup of tea.

92
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:18,712
- Well, I just had one actually.
- Well, that's all right.

93
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:22,816
Thank you.

94
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:39,979
It's nice up here now.

95
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,598
Yes, it's not bad, is it?

96
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:50,013
I was in the police during the war, you know.

97
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:51,594
Were you?

98
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,883
We had a lot to do with medical stuff then.

99
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,460
Consulting.

100
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:03,668
I'm always on
hand for advice Beryl, if you...

101
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:09,798
Has Beryl gone out, Mrs. Christie?

102
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,066
- Don't know.
- I'll go up.

103
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,460
Beryl, it's me.

104
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,417
- Oh, I was looking for Beryl.
- She's...

105
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:34,935
- Oh, I thought it would be you Alice.
- I got you all the stuff for tea.

106
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:37,329
- Oh, thank you.
- Alice, this is a...

107
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,739
- Who was that?
- That was the ground floor.

108
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:03,265
Am I late?

109
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:16,124
- My tummy is been playing me up again today.
- Oh Reg.

110
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,548
Tim? Tim, might I...

111
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:48,305
- Might I have a word?
- Mr. Christie, why sure.

112
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:51,833
There was a gentleman at
the door for you today, he left this.

113
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:01,890
- What it say Mr. Christie?
- Oh yes, I forgot.

114
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,247
Well, there's no need to read it anyway,
it's about the payments on your furniture.

115
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,560
You're six weeks in arrears apparently.

116
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,892
- Not paid, you mean?
- No.

117
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:18,112
I didn't mention it to...

118
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,807
Beryl or worry her with that.

119
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,883
Well, she has the money
Mr. Christie, she has it every week.

120
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:28,723
I gave him 10 shillings out of my own pocket.
I don't want this house getting a name Tim.

121
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,981
Oh, that damn girl.

122
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:35,955
All right, don't you worry Mr. Christie,
you, you'll get that money back.

123
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:38,606
I'll be getting a new job
shortly, I shouldn't wonder.

124
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:43,597
They've asked me if I want to train as
a manager or as a managing director.

125
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,049
Or something, you know.

126
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:50,862
Yes, won't you have to learn
to read and write for that?

127
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:55,169
Oh, no, no, no. You have
secretaries, things like that, see?

128
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:58,496
Yes.

129
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,920
Well, as long as I get my 10 shillings back.

130
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:06,362
- Oh, that damn woman.
- Oh, and Tim, there was a young girl...

131
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:11,565
- in and out of here all day.
- Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Christie.

132
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:18,759
What's the matter?

133
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,129
Oh, hello. Hello little one.

134
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:27,464
What you've been doing today then, eh?

135
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:33,263
- Oh, where's Beryl?
- Oh, she's having a bit of a lie down.

136
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:34,664
She's not feeling too grand.

137
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:47,486
- What's all this then?
- I'm all right, I'm just having a lie down.

138
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:53,413
Now, what's all this about
the furniture money then?

139
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,314
The what?

140
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:58,203
You know bloody well what,
so don't give me all that.

141
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,090
The man was here.
Six weeks it hasn't been paid.

142
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,604
And I slave my guts out
for that money my girl.

143
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:08,505
So do I, four pounds 10 a week to feed you...

144
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:12,415
pay the rent and all the installments,
and buy everything for the baby...

145
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,892
and another one on the way.

146
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:23,885
Yes, that's right, another one on the way.

147
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,808
Oh we, we can't have another kid yet.

148
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:33,021
And that's exactly what we're going
to get unless I do something about it..

149
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,173
Do something?

150
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:42,457
- Do what?
- Oh, never mind what.

151
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:43,974
She wants to go to bed now.

152
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:49,402
- Do what?
- Tim, there are things you can do.

153
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,391
- Oh no, you don't my lady.
- Well, it's my choice, isn't it?

154
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:56,758
Anyway, I done it, I taken some pills.

155
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,249
What you think I'm lying here for?

156
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,179
Well, you didn't even
ask me, you didn't even tell me.

157
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,443
Ask you, do I have to ask your permission?

158
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,345
Yes, you bloody do.
And does she know about this?

159
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,938
- Now, leave Alice out of this.
- You knew about this, didn't you?

160
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:10,436
- No.
- Leave Alice alone.

161
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,010
She's staying here tonight to look after me.

162
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:15,211
- Oh no, she's not, I know her sort.
- What's that meant to mean?

163
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:18,147
Never you mind, I met your sort before.
Don't you worry leading her along.

164
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:21,827
No. Tim, now look what you've done.
Get out, and leave Alice alone.

165
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,188
I wouldn't touch her
with a bloody barge pole.

166
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:26,018
- Beryl, I think I'd better go.
- No.

167
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,656
- He can sleep in the kitchen.
- I'm not sleeping anywhere,

168
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:29,990
So don't you fret and I'm not coming back...

169
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:31,391
- so don't expect me.
- Good.

170
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:32,883
Bloody old cow.

171
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:40,241
No, I'm not the sort of man who can
make do with just one woman.

172
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:41,312
No? Go on.

173
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,152
No, it's in the family, see.

174
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:46,732
I mean, you take my brother, he's
paying out hundreds a year in alimony.

175
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,331
Well, thousands.

176
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:52,228
Mind you I'm fly, what you think
I got waiting for me when I get home?

177
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:53,399
The rent collector?

178
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:58,658
Rent collector, he's a bit
of a humorist, isn't he our Wally?

179
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,312
All tucked up nice and warm
in bed with the wife.

180
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:05,079
- That's what I said, the rent collector.
- I'll bloody hit you in a minute.

181
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,141
Go it, Taffy.

182
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,545
No, there's two of them see, there's Beryl
and this other little dark one, Alice.

183
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:17,230
Just lying there
waiting for it, crying out for it.

184
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:20,360
Three in a bed, eh? How about that?

185
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,746
You can have my old woman
if you like, that will make up the set.

186
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,380
Thanks very much Bub
I'll take you up on that one day...

187
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,281
I got enough to be going on with that.

188
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,953
Oh well, if you're traveling around like
me, you know, it's Brighton one day and...

189
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:39,048
Birmingham the next, you usually manage
to pick up a bit on the way, you know.

190
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,849
That's not all you'll pick up
if you go on like that lad.

191
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,781
Oh, no, no. These aren't scrubbers like you
might get man. Oh no, these is ladies.

192
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:51,407
Rich ladies. Well, you know,
get bore, they're wanting a bit of fun.

193
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:55,832
Elegant but passionate.

194
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:11,487
Come on you, out.

195
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,630
- Tim?
- Out.

196
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,577
Beryl wants me here, she may need me here.

197
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,679
I don't bloody need you here and it's my bed.

198
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,280
Don't wake her Tim, she's tired.

199
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:22,820
So I'm tired too, I'm tired of having you
around, so come on, you bloody get out.

200
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,721
And you just bloody leave us in peace.

201
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,761
And you get back in bed and keep out of it...

202
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:28,608
- just get on out of here.
- Tim, just for the night.

203
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:31,259
- She may not be well.
- Oh, and whose fault that, eh?

204
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,049
- Tim, be quiet.
- Go on out, hurry out.

205
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:36,643
- Let go of Alice.
- You take your hands off me.

206
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:39,100
- Don't you touch me like that.
- I have my bloody rights, haven't I?

207
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,262
Don't touch me.

208
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,422
- What's it Reg?
- That's the Evanses again.

209
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:44,771
Get off Tim.

210
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,129
Get off me, get that bloody here.

211
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:54,841
Take your hands off me.

212
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,342
You bloody touch me again,
I'm throwing her out.

213
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:00,837
Don't be so bloody silly.

214
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:01,810
It's my bloody house, isn't it?

215
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,314
- I got rights in my own bloody house.
- Let go me.

216
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:06,976
Now then, now then, now then.

217
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:15,230
What is all this about?

218
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:18,252
- It's all her Mr. Christie.
- Calm down, you just calm down.

219
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:20,457
Well, it's just because
I got Alice staying here a night.

220
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,998
- Staying the night?
- In my bloody bed.

221
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,799
- All right.
- And I'm meant to stay on the bloody floor,

222
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,150
- in the bloody kitchen.
- All right, All right.

223
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,220
There's no need for language.

224
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:33,432
This is an apartment for two persons.
That's quite clear in the lease.

225
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,632
- What lease?
- The statutory regulations.

226
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:38,808
Well, Alice is just staying
with me because I'm not well.

227
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,033
Never mind about that, I know the law.

228
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,115
Now then, you can't
be guaranteed security of tenure...

229
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,646
if you're overcrowded, that is a regulation.

230
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:52,852
That's right my girl, you put your
shoes on and go about your business.

231
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,303
- Why should she?
- It's all right Beryl, I'll go.

232
00:21:56,021 --> 00:22:00,837
Any more of this sort of behaviour,
and out you go, both of you.

233
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:12,572
- I just want a bit of peace Mr. Christie.
- All right then.

234
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:14,232
Beryl.

235
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:19,191
Beryl, if you're not well you shouldn't
be larking around at this time of night.

236
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,072
You should see a doctor.

237
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:41,661
- Lovely day today Mr. Christie, ain't it?
- Very nice, yes.

238
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:29,274
Oh hello Beryl. How are you today?

239
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:33,928
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you Mr. Christie.
- Have you been to see the doctor yet?

240
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,723
The doctor? Oh no.

241
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:44,397
- Well, won't you come in a minute? I...
- Well, I got the, put the kettle on.

242
00:23:57,341 --> 00:24:00,936
Well, sit down Beryl, do in the deck chair.

243
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:13,244
Well now, what is all this
trouble between you and Tim?

244
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:16,482
And don't try and tell me
there isn't any trouble.

245
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:18,569
No.

246
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:21,972
You're very young, you know.

247
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:27,686
Unexperienced and things which may seem...

248
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:31,451
great problems to you...

249
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:35,518
may seem simpler to an older head, you know.

250
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:40,344
But it's just that I,
I'm going to have a baby.

251
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,804
Yes, I see.

252
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,808
Tim, I suppose...

253
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:54,664
is none too keen
on this addition to the family.

254
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:57,325
No.

255
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:02,855
Well, I'm not either, I,
I took some pills yesterday.

256
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:09,226
- Pills?
- Yes, they didn't work though.

257
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,811
You see Mr. Christie, Tim
only gets 7 pounds a week. Well...

258
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,204
we can't afford another baby now.

259
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:22,764
No, I understand that.

260
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:25,394
I...

261
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:33,054
I do know people,
medical people, who could help you out.

262
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,431
But that would cost money, wouldn't it?

263
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,971
- Yes, that's, that's true.
- Yes.

264
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:42,161
That's true, I'm afraid.

265
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:46,872
They are very eminent men,
one particularly I have in mind I...

266
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:52,099
I used to assist him in his earlier days.

267
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:54,336
Studied with him.

268
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:58,830
It's quite a simple matter.

269
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:04,786
You, you mean you know
how to do it Mr. Christie?

270
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:07,938
Oh yes. Oh, that's not a problem.

271
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,559
I seen it done a hundred times.

272
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:16,330
Terminations we call them.
Had to learn about that in the police.

273
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:22,043
Well, I suppose you couldn't...

274
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:24,747
Oh, I...

275
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:28,774
I know it's against the law and everything.

276
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:34,531
Oh no, that's, that's all right.

277
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:38,726
As long as nobody goes telling
tales out at school. Sugar?

278
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:42,012
- No, I wouldn't...
- It's the moral question that concerns me.

279
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,292
I wouldn't tell
a soul Mr. Christie, honestly.

280
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:45,707
The taking of life.

281
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:52,761
- No matter how rudimentary.
- Well, it's not really.

282
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:58,819
I'd be ever so grateful Mr. Christie.

283
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,943
All right, I will.

284
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:22,962
Is such a weight off my mind.
Honestly, Mr. Christie, honestly.

285
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:30,999
When you think you could?

286
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,403
Oh, you think you could?

287
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,911
Well, you have a word with Tim tonight, eh?

288
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,288
- Yes.
- And...

289
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,467
Perhaps we'll be able
to fit you in tomorrow.

290
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:44,468
Yes.

291
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:53,790
What you doing here then Beryl?
Now then, now then.

292
00:27:58,316 --> 00:27:59,916
I thought we go to the pictures.

293
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,368
- Oh, did you then?
- Yes.

294
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:07,265
Now, Mrs. Christie is
looking after Geraldine.

295
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,475
And you and I are going
to have a night out, Ok?

296
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:15,456
- Well, all right then, come on.
- Oh, the bus.

297
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,741
Here now.

298
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,762
- Did you like it? The film?
- Oh, it was all right.

299
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:16,573
- Didn't see too much of it.
- I like Gregory Peck.

300
00:29:16,603 --> 00:29:17,867
He's Ok.

301
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,516
You know, you're a bit like him to look at.

302
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:26,025
- Good God girl, you hardly had one drink.
- No no, you are.

303
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,220
He's about 7 foot 3 for a start off.

304
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:34,072
I know but just around
the eyes, you look like him.

305
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,173
Mr. Christie was talking to me today.

306
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:46,689
- What? About last night?
- Oh no, he was, he was Ok about that.

307
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,808
He...

308
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,469
Well, he said he might be able to help us.

309
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:58,344
- About the baby, you know.
- Oh?

310
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:01,724
So what's he think he can do?

311
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,934
Well, he had experience of things like that.

312
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:13,825
- You mean getting rid of it?
- Termination it's called.

313
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,042
Oh, I...

314
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,439
No, I don't know about that, Beryl.

315
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,441
No, no. I don't think he wants
money or anything like that.

316
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:22,788
That's not what I mean.

317
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,122
Tim...

318
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:28,573
We can't have another
kiddie now, you know we can't.

319
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:33,513
Well I, I know I could always get a...

320
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,219
bigger job, pays more cash.

321
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:39,698
You know I could go to night
school, get qualified in something.

322
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:54,175
- What's he do, anyhow?
- I don't know.

323
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:02,049
Yeah.

324
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:17,645
All right, then.

325
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:22,772
Hey, mind the beer girl.

326
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:41,386
Tim...

327
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:45,125
Will you tell Mr. Christie it's all
right when you go down the stairs?

328
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,405
- I don't like it, Beryl.
- Oh Tim...

329
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:50,954
You can't go back on it now.

330
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,935
Ok, Ok.

331
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:10,498
Mr. Christie?

332
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:17,418
Mr. Christie?

333
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,179
- Oh, there you are Mr. Christie.
- Oh Tim, come in, come in.

334
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:30,324
- Look Mr. Christie, Beryl has been tell...
- Shut the door, will you? Do you mind?

335
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:31,451
Oh, no.

336
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:40,787
Tim...

337
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:46,959
I dislike this business as much as you do.

338
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:50,196
- Well, I don't know Mister...
- It's just that I happen to...

339
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:55,165
had picked up this knowledge whilst I
was in training as a doctor, before the war.

340
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:57,771
Oh, I didn't know you did
all this medical stuff.

341
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,345
Oh yes.

342
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:05,202
Yes yes, unfortunately my
training was interrupted by a motoring...

343
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:07,679
accident and then...

344
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,025
- then the war came and...
- Well, I suppose...

345
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:17,027
I was browsing through
some of my medical texts...

346
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:21,447
Before you came in, as a matter
of fact, perhaps you like to...

347
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:31,451
Yes, well, I, I don't know
about all this stuff, see.

348
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,229
No, no.

349
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:37,924
But how you...

350
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,545
I mean...

351
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:43,849
How do you actually do it?

352
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:49,971
Well, that's something only
doctors and myself know about.

353
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,961
It has to be secret, you understand.

354
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:56,873
We couldn't have every Tom, Dick and
Harry going around doing it, could we?

355
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,530
No, no, I understand that, but...

356
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:06,138
I won't conceal the dangers from your mind...

357
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,923
The...

358
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:13,740
the stuff I use...

359
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:18,519
- one in 10 might die from it.
- Die?

360
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:22,371
Well yes, that's an acceptable
medical risk, that's understood.

361
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:26,000
Mind you, they
probably use too strong a dose.

362
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,673
If only you and...

363
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:35,016
Beryl had come to me earlier,
I could've done it without any risk at all.

364
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:37,038
I...

365
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,314
Oh, I don't know, I don't know Mr. Christie.

366
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:44,528
Well Tim...

367
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:49,668
if you haven't got complete
confidence in my ability...

368
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:56,898
No, no, I, I trust
you Mr. Christie, of course I do.

369
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:01,609
All right then.

370
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:09,020
Good lad. Right, well you cut
along to work, otherwise...

371
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:14,104
you'll be late. And Tim, remember...

372
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,293
- we've never lost a father yet.
- No.

373
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:26,567
Well, thank you Mr. Christie.

374
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:03,929
Ethel?

375
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:05,878
Ethel...

376
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,739
Ethel, I want you to
go to the office for me, will you?

377
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,968
See Mr. Steadman, tell him my back is been
playing me up and I shan't be in today.

378
00:36:13,998 --> 00:36:16,218
Oh Reg, are you going to the doctor?

379
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,543
No, no, I'll be all right.

380
00:36:19,006 --> 00:36:21,456
- I'll phone from the corner.
- No, you better go.

381
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:24,917
They'll want theses bills
of lading and invoices right away.

382
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,518
- Go get your coat darling.
- All right.

383
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,340
I'm ready Reg.

384
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:13,640
- Tell him I ought to be better tomorrow.
- All right.

385
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,331
- Yes, what's it?
- Mr. Christie?

386
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:47,718
- Yes.
- Builders.

387
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,840
Repair roof to outhouse, re-plaster
where necessary and make good.

388
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:57,717
- Now? It's not convenient.
- You are Mr. Christie?

389
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,812
You complained the landlord
about this outhouse.

390
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,888
Well I, I need to be informed in advance.

391
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:09,897
But look mate, I just take
my orders from the owners.

392
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:16,126
- It is just the, the wash-house, is it?
- Just the outbuildings, yeah.

393
00:40:19,107 --> 00:40:20,563
You better come through.

394
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:25,841
Now, thank you very much.

395
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:30,847
I was just having a cup of tea.

396
00:40:31,237 --> 00:40:34,791
Oh, back up here, on the right.

397
00:40:42,497 --> 00:40:45,524
- This is it, the wash-house.
- Right.

398
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:50,878
All this lot will have
to come down for a start.

399
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:53,459
How long will take?

400
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:57,016
Oh, shouldn't take more
than a couple of days.

401
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:22,018
- Be careful, do you mind?
- Yeah, mind the paintwork mate.

402
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,466
And the priceless antiques.

403
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:27,418
Mr. Christie?

404
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,150
Are you?

405
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:35,581
- I got the builders in.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

406
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,712
Here we are then,
brought you a little cup of tea.

407
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:41,052
Oh. Thank you.

408
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:44,809
What are they doing, the builders?

409
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:49,893
Oh they, they won't disturb us.

410
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:55,335
- Baby asleep, is she?
- Yes, she's in the other room.

411
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:56,906
Right, that's well then...

412
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:01,865
we can manage in here then.
Just drink your tea and relax.

413
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:10,481
- Is it going to hurt?
- Just a little twinge but we can help that.

414
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:17,197
Open the window for me 6 inches, will you?
And perhaps you better pull down the blind.

415
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:38,062
Fast asleep.

416
00:43:41,313 --> 00:43:42,315
Right.

417
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:49,361
Just pass me my bag, will you?

418
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:52,443
Thanks.

419
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,292
Oh, what's that for?

420
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:04,373
- Just a whiff of gas.
- Gas?

421
00:44:04,403 --> 00:44:07,666
Like at the dentist.,
take away those little twinges.

422
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:12,433
- But that's poisonous, isn't it?
- Oh no. Not the way we use it.

423
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:16,758
Something we had to learn during the war...

424
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:19,665
for bomb victims...

425
00:44:21,384 --> 00:44:24,190
that needed urgent surgery.

426
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:30,239
It's a chemically compounded filter, you see.

427
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:32,424
The liquid...

428
00:44:33,513 --> 00:44:38,170
takes out the carbon monoxide or CO-2...

429
00:44:39,026 --> 00:44:40,955
as we call it.

430
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,144
There. Right.

431
00:44:49,207 --> 00:44:53,717
Right, just get scrubbed up.

432
00:44:56,767 --> 00:45:01,922
- There isn't any cutting, is there?
- Oh, no no, no no.

433
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:14,554
I'm ever so nervous Mr. Christie.

434
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:19,452
Oh, there's no need to be, no need at all.

435
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:22,143
You have...

436
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:26,712
- undergarments on?
- Yes.

437
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:30,277
Well, just slip them off, will you?

438
00:45:47,605 --> 00:45:52,688
- Oh, should I take my dress off?
- No, no, just the...

439
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,769
And then lie down on the quilt.

440
00:46:08,326 --> 00:46:11,802
- Right down?
- Yes, just lie down and relax.

441
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:21,786
- You ready?
- Yes.

442
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,812
Is a good girl.

443
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:42,019
Now, just a little whiff of the gas.

444
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:49,566
You had gas before at the dentist, have you?
Well, you know what it feels like then.

445
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:53,733
You'll feel just a little
bit dizzy, I expect.

446
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:58,173
Right, now breathe deeply.

447
00:46:58,345 --> 00:47:01,194
Breathe, just relax,
breathe deeply, close your eyes.

448
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:04,469
Close your eyes, that's a good girl.

449
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:06,809
That's a good girl.

450
00:47:07,093 --> 00:47:08,778
Breathe.

451
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,132
Breathe, breathe Beryl.

452
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,321
That's it.

453
00:47:23,752 --> 00:47:28,177
No., no, no, no, no. Quiet. Quiet.

454
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:33,923
Be quiet. Be, be quiet, quiet.

455
00:47:34,627 --> 00:47:35,932
No, I don't want to.

456
00:47:36,214 --> 00:47:39,171
- Please, please. Don't make me hurt you.
- No.

457
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:40,201
Please.

458
00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:50,591
Oh, Beryl.

459
00:48:29,215 --> 00:48:33,817
- Howdy dowdie do?
- Hey come on, come on.

460
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,093
Beryl.

461
00:48:54,451 --> 00:48:55,597
Beryl?

462
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,315
Beryl?

463
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,260
If you don't want to see me,
you've only got to say so.

464
00:49:17,262 --> 00:49:18,336
Beryl?

465
00:49:54,665 --> 00:49:55,982
Mummy.

466
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,944
Mummy.

467
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:40,295
- Oh, hello Mr. Christie.
- It's bad news Tim.

468
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,159
It didn't work.

469
00:50:47,054 --> 00:50:48,500
Well, where is Beryl then?

470
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:51,764
- She's upstairs on the bed.
- Oh, Tim.

471
00:50:51,794 --> 00:50:52,794
Lying down.

472
00:50:56,076 --> 00:50:58,238
Go on up, I'll come up with you.

473
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:14,661
Beryl?

474
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,932
She's got blood all down her chin.

475
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:35,276
That's the concussion I'm afraid,
she would struggle, you see.

476
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:39,331
Concussed her head against the bed head.

477
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,409
It's got sharp corners, that bed head.

478
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,162
Beryl?

479
00:51:56,169 --> 00:51:57,849
She's not alive.

480
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:01,061
I told you it was bad.

481
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:07,425
- But you, you never said...
- One out of 10 die of it, I told you that.

482
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,176
Oh, Christ.

483
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:19,110
I'm sorry Tim, these things happen, though.

484
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:23,004
She should've approached me earlier.

485
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:28,188
Oh God, and she was only young.

486
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:35,076
Yes, it's a terrible thing but she's
about to be in hospital by now, anyway.

487
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:38,269
Doctors couldn't have helped her even.

488
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:43,649
Her tummy was septic poisoned.

489
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,439
All those pills she been
dosing herself up with.

490
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:53,913
- Oh God, Oh God, those damn pills.
- Don't, don't wake the baby Tim.

491
00:52:56,357 --> 00:53:00,581
- What am I going to do?
- Come with me, come on. Come on.

492
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:02,482
Come on.

493
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,062
Sit down.

494
00:53:15,644 --> 00:53:17,076
You'll get the doctor?

495
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:23,491
Doctors can't do much now, I'm afraid Tim.

496
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:28,821
Well, we got to do something,
police or something.

497
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:34,997
- Yes, you may be right.
- Well, that's what I think anyhow.

498
00:53:37,918 --> 00:53:41,226
It will be criminal manslaughter
for me, of course.

499
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,460
Oh, God, I don't want to get
you into trouble Mr. Christie.

500
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:53,941
No, I'm not just thinking about me so
much, I'm not the only one involved.

501
00:53:55,174 --> 00:53:57,236
You knew all about it, didn't you?

502
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:05,684
- Well, of course I knew about it.
- Well, don't get huffy with me my lad.

503
00:54:07,074 --> 00:54:09,293
You knew about it, that's the point.

504
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:12,687
You're an accessory before the act.

505
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:17,916
Well, I done nothing.

506
00:54:19,618 --> 00:54:21,680
Oh, God, I done nothing.

507
00:54:23,842 --> 00:54:27,937
But you knew about it Tim, you consented.

508
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,585
That's all they will want to know.

509
00:54:32,004 --> 00:54:34,634
All right, all right then, I'll...

510
00:54:34,664 --> 00:54:39,014
I'll not tell them nothing, I'll just say I
don't know nothing and just keep clammed up.

511
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:45,136
You better go and see to the baby,
you can't leave her crying like that.

512
00:55:04,598 --> 00:55:06,675
Poor old Timmy.

513
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:13,862
I could get you out of this if
only you didn't keep talking so silly.

514
00:55:16,626 --> 00:55:19,819
I just don't know what to do.

515
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,819
Well, we could keep
quiet about it, couldn't we?

516
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:31,332
She's just lying there.

517
00:55:34,783 --> 00:55:35,783
Well...

518
00:55:36,788 --> 00:55:38,292
there are ways of...

519
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,184
disposing of bodies.

520
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:45,133
What? Not be buried, you mean?

521
00:55:46,225 --> 00:55:50,662
- No proper service?
- What good would a proper service do?

522
00:55:50,692 --> 00:55:56,191
Well, she want it, that's what.
And me too I, I want it.

523
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,477
You want it? She want it?

524
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,311
You want to be hung?

525
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:06,828
Is that what you want?

526
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:31,867
You better see to the baby supper,
she'll be crying for it in a minute.

527
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:42,220
They don't hang you for manslaughter anyhow.

528
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:44,432
No.

529
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:48,100
They do for murder though.

530
00:56:50,964 --> 00:56:54,314
They will just think you killed her
in one of those fights of yours.

531
00:56:54,673 --> 00:56:56,742
She's got that knock on the head.

532
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,801
The whole street knows about
the fights you have all the time.

533
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:03,236
The police know even.

534
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,579
- What do you mean? I...
- I mean...

535
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:13,518
you start going to the police or
whatever and I'm going to have to deny...

536
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:18,415
- I had anything to do with it.
- Oh, they'll know.

537
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:22,137
They will know from the operation you did.

538
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:27,122
Oh, no my lad, there are no
visible signs, not the way I do it.

539
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:32,190
All right then, all right,
I'll tell them and then They'll know.

540
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,980
Who you think they will believe Tim?

541
00:57:36,087 --> 00:57:40,187
Everyone around here knows the stories you
come out with about your father being...

542
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:42,207
an Italian count and everything.

543
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:45,795
Oh, it's just storyfying,
everyone knows that.

544
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:53,089
Anyhow, he was an Italian, my father.

545
00:57:54,068 --> 00:57:57,018
Well, he may not have been a
count, I don't know about that.

546
00:57:57,203 --> 00:57:58,721
An Italian named Evans?

547
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:02,709
He are, it's just a name he used so as
people wouldn't know who he was.

548
00:58:05,021 --> 00:58:09,063
Well, he was in this secret business see?
Well, that's why we were so rich.

549
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:12,751
He had all his money
in shares and everything.

550
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:16,109
Only he lost it, because
he was killed in the war.

551
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:19,733
So who are the police going to believe, eh?

552
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,700
You...

553
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:25,658
or me that was a special
constable for four years?

554
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,218
Well, me of course, me.

555
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:31,084
All right then Tim...

556
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:34,164
Well, you go to the police
and tell them, go on.

557
00:58:35,922 --> 00:58:36,924
Off you go.

558
00:58:37,978 --> 00:58:39,841
All right, I will do.

559
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:42,856
Well, they'll have to believe the truth.

560
00:58:44,786 --> 00:58:46,486
Well, go on then, if you're going.

561
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:51,921
Well, I can't go now, can I?
I got the baby to feed and everything.

562
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:55,963
I'll do that, I'll do that
for you while you're gone.

563
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:10,785
Well, you tell me.

564
00:59:12,545 --> 00:59:15,153
Tell me what to do and then I won't go.

565
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:17,437
No no, you got to do what you think's right.

566
00:59:17,467 --> 00:59:19,864
Well, let's just shut the door and talk, eh?

567
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,826
All right.

568
00:59:29,755 --> 00:59:33,159
- You're going to be guided by me?
- Yes, Ok Mr. Christie.

569
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:37,187
Right, sit down.

570
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:49,116
Now, first of all is
Beryl, I'll look after that.

571
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,413
I'll, I'll dispose of her.

572
00:59:55,002 --> 01:00:01,669
I'll wait till I get a chance, you know the
the big manhole cover by the front door?

573
01:00:02,845 --> 01:00:05,370
- Lay her to rest there.
- Oh, Oh, God.

574
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,941
- Is no time for you to break down.
- Yes, I know, I know, I'm sorry.

575
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:17,127
It would look better if you went away for
a bit. Right away, tonight, out of London.

576
01:00:17,157 --> 01:00:18,632
- I don't.
- Listen to me.

577
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:26,716
Then I could tell people that you
and Beryl had gone away together.

578
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:32,623
And what about the baby? Geraldine?

579
01:00:32,653 --> 01:00:35,708
Oh, she'll be all right.
It's very lucky, as a matter of fact.

580
01:00:36,206 --> 01:00:40,703
There's a young couple over at Acton
I know who will look after her for you.

581
01:00:41,281 --> 01:00:44,690
East Acton to be precise.

582
01:00:45,212 --> 01:00:50,224
They can't have any of
their own so it's handy really.

583
01:00:51,176 --> 01:00:54,435
So you just leave all her things packed up.

584
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:58,109
And I'll get them to come over
and collect her in the morning.

585
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:01,816
But I'll be able to have her back, won't I?

586
01:01:02,554 --> 01:01:08,414
- I mean when, when all this has blown over.
- Oh yes, yes. Yes I daresay.

587
01:01:12,537 --> 01:01:14,619
Right then, you get the baby fed.

588
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:19,703
Oh God Mr. Christie, and she was only young.

589
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:23,625
If she'd come to me earlier...

590
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:10,127
Come and give me a hand.

591
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,185
Grab her, grab her legs.

592
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:42,596
Let her down, let her down.

593
01:02:45,322 --> 01:02:50,432
We'll put her in Kitchener place, the old man
is in hospital, he won't be back for days.

594
01:03:10,056 --> 01:03:12,106
She'll be all right in there for tonight.

595
01:03:13,486 --> 01:03:15,871
- Take this.
- What's this?

596
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:18,995
Wedding ring, sell it.

597
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:23,788
It will make her less easy to
identify, if they do ever find her.

598
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:27,172
Oh...

599
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:33,556
Now you get packed and
then get a night train anywhere,

600
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:35,835
And I'll get those
people over from East Acton...

601
01:03:35,836 --> 01:03:38,236
first thing in the morning for the baby.

602
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:46,289
- You better go and finish feeding her.
- Yes Mr. Christie.

603
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:50,525
Go on, go on.

604
01:06:25,409 --> 01:06:27,932
- Hello Auntie Vi.
- Tim?

605
01:06:28,355 --> 01:06:33,183
Oh, what are you doing down here?
Come in, come in.

606
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:39,532
Carl, it's Tim.

607
01:06:40,428 --> 01:06:45,009
Tim boy, what are you
doing in this neck of the woods?

608
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,263
Sit down Tim, take your coat off.

609
01:06:47,293 --> 01:06:51,477
Well, me and the boss is touring
round trying to find new branches.

610
01:06:51,988 --> 01:06:55,548
- Only the car broke down in Cardiff.
- There's tea, fresh brewed Tim.

611
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:58,612
- You still like egg and fried bread?
- Oh, smashing.

612
01:07:00,753 --> 01:07:03,392
It will be a few days the car.

613
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:06,885
- Big end is gone, they said.
- How is Beryl?

614
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:09,915
We can put you up on the
settee in the back room if you like.

615
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:10,916
Thanks, Auntie.

616
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:12,771
How is Beryl and the baby?

617
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:18,662
Oh fine, fine. They've gone to Brighton
for a bit to stay with Beryl father.

618
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,566
I just been upstairs.

619
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,336
- He's gone.
- Tim?

620
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:34,337
Packed up and left.

621
01:07:35,338 --> 01:07:37,553
His clothes and everything, scarpered.

622
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:42,119
And that's not the worst part.

623
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:45,614
What's the matter Reg?

624
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:49,197
You know what he's gone and done?

625
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:51,470
What?

626
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,764
He's killed the baby.

627
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,570
- I don't believe it.
- I'm telling you, strangled,

628
01:08:00,571 --> 01:08:02,975
- If you must know, with his tie.
- He never do that.

629
01:08:02,976 --> 01:08:05,002
Never mind what he
never do, it's what he's done.

630
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:06,621
He worshipped that child.

631
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:10,287
- When I think of all the things.
- Reg, what we going to do?

632
01:08:15,138 --> 01:08:16,138
Nothing.

633
01:10:08,218 --> 01:10:11,462
Hey, see what I bought Geraldine in Cardiff.

634
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,120
Did you go into the garage about the car?

635
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,361
Oh yes, yes, they say it will be
a bit. They will let me know.

636
01:10:20,058 --> 01:10:21,127
There.

637
01:10:22,443 --> 01:10:25,332
- Woolworth's I got it.
- Oh, it's lovely Tim.

638
01:10:26,838 --> 01:10:30,423
Tim, your uncle and I wrote a
letter to Mr. Thorley on Monday.

639
01:10:31,426 --> 01:10:34,175
- Thorley?
- Beryl's father.

640
01:10:35,424 --> 01:10:39,124
- Oh, what you want to write to him for?
- Because a telegram this morning.

641
01:10:39,478 --> 01:10:42,378
He said he hasn't seen Beryl
and the baby since the summer.

642
01:10:43,329 --> 01:10:48,270
- What you want to go poking around for?
- But where is she Tim? What's happened?

643
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:52,338
I don't want to talk about it
and none of your business anyhow.

644
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:58,039
- She's, she's gone off.
- Gone off?

645
01:10:59,142 --> 01:11:01,845
With some fellow, I don't know, do I?

646
01:11:02,617 --> 01:11:06,262
- In a car.
- But what about little Geraldine?

647
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:09,147
Look, just stop asking
questions at me, will you?

648
01:11:09,272 --> 01:11:11,772
- Now then Tim...
- Don't you now, then me she's...

649
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:14,893
She's gone off with some rich
fellow and that's all there's about it.

650
01:11:14,894 --> 01:11:16,944
- Oh Tim, we're only...
- Never mind that.

651
01:11:16,945 --> 01:11:20,945
- She's not that sort of a girl Tim.
- Well, I'm going out, I'm bloody going out.

652
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:06,399
Yeah, I think that's the number.

653
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:11,171
- Yeah, that's Ok.
- There's the record card.

654
01:12:18,287 --> 01:12:21,121
- I...
- Yes sir?

655
01:12:22,058 --> 01:12:25,498
Is there an inspector
or sergeant or somebody here?

656
01:12:26,317 --> 01:12:30,243
There's nobody available at
the moment sir, can I help you?

657
01:12:32,372 --> 01:12:35,389
I'd like to have a bit of a
chat with you alone like.

658
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:41,356
- All right.
- Excuse me sir.

659
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:47,021
Well now...

660
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:53,511
I want to give myself up
I disposed of my wife.

661
01:12:54,576 --> 01:12:57,176
Now wait a minute.
Do you realize what you're saying?

662
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:01,895
Oh, I know what I'm saying. I can't
sleep for it, I want to get it off my chest.

663
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:06,706
She was expecting, see.

664
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,459
And we have one already.

665
01:13:10,923 --> 01:13:13,466
Anyhow, I met this fellow in Ipswich.

666
01:13:13,496 --> 01:13:16,779
He just come up to me in a cafe
and give me this bottle of stuff.

667
01:13:17,245 --> 01:13:20,595
Why, I told her not to take it but
she said she was going to anyhow.

668
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:24,387
So I come home from
work and there she is dead.

669
01:13:24,653 --> 01:13:30,753
She had the empty bottle beside her
and I didn't know what to do, so I got...

670
01:13:31,196 --> 01:13:34,802
I, I didn't know what to do so 2 in
the morning, I got her downstairs...

671
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:38,539
and I opened the drain outside the
front door and I put her body...

672
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,801
down the drain.

673
01:13:44,735 --> 01:13:46,470
And then I come down here.

674
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:49,938
You want to make a statement, in writing?

675
01:13:53,611 --> 01:13:56,673
Well, I'll tell you about it
and you write it down, eh?

676
01:13:57,717 --> 01:14:00,817
I'm not all that educated.
I can't do this reading and writing.

677
01:14:28,433 --> 01:14:30,813
Yeah, that's what he said.

678
01:14:32,712 --> 01:14:34,112
He's a bit simple, you know.

679
01:14:35,855 --> 01:14:39,594
Yeah Ok. I'll have another go at him.
Yeah, goodbye.

680
01:14:47,694 --> 01:14:48,694
Well now...

681
01:14:50,701 --> 01:14:54,853
The drain where you said you put
your wife body, it's been examined.

682
01:14:56,515 --> 01:14:57,615
There's nothing there.

683
01:15:02,212 --> 01:15:03,893
Well, I put it there.

684
01:15:05,874 --> 01:15:06,937
I see.

685
01:15:08,482 --> 01:15:09,726
It's a manhole, is it?

686
01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:13,725
I expect so.

687
01:15:14,922 --> 01:15:16,522
Who helped you lift the lid off?

688
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,310
I did it myself.

689
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:22,282
Who are you trying to kid?

690
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:25,696
It took three men to lift it.

691
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:28,434
Well, I don't know about that, I did it.

692
01:15:30,986 --> 01:15:33,636
I don't think your wife body
was ever down that drain.

693
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:37,537
All right.

694
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:42,267
All right. I only said that
to protect a man named Christie.

695
01:15:43,387 --> 01:15:45,186
- Christie?
- Yes.

696
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:47,676
It's not true about the man in the cafe.

697
01:15:51,454 --> 01:15:53,017
Now I'll tell you the truth.

698
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:01,997
She wasn't very good with money
I'm afraid, run up a lot of bad debts.

699
01:16:02,343 --> 01:16:04,996
That was one of the reasons
they were always fighting.

700
01:16:11,456 --> 01:16:14,881
This was their little domain.

701
01:16:16,834 --> 01:16:19,734
- What's it? Just the two rooms?
- Just the two rooms, yes.

702
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,454
You'd only have to ask the neighbours
about the fights they had I'm afraid.

703
01:16:29,053 --> 01:16:32,323
One of your chaps from the station had to
come round one night, as a matter of fact.

704
01:16:32,324 --> 01:16:34,559
- You saw them go, did you?
- No.

705
01:16:35,032 --> 01:16:36,794
No, they just crept off.

706
01:16:38,601 --> 01:16:42,208
- Who has the flat below this?
- Mr. Kitchener, an old gentleman.

707
01:16:42,454 --> 01:16:43,943
Worked on the railways.

708
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:57,040
Inspector you, you want to look
at his flat Mr. Kitchener, I expect.

709
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,827
Oh, yes.

710
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,117
Yes well, he's in hospital at
the moment so he'll not mind.

711
01:17:03,197 --> 01:17:04,860
I just found these, sir.

712
01:17:08,112 --> 01:17:10,112
They're all about the torso murder case.

713
01:17:10,864 --> 01:17:13,663
Oh yes, a bit morbid about that case Tim was.

714
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:16,261
Kept all the newspaper cuttings.
Can't think why.

715
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:18,266
I thought he couldn't read.

716
01:17:18,787 --> 01:17:21,812
No, he used to get Beryl to read them to him.

717
01:17:23,137 --> 01:17:24,887
I better take a look in here first.

718
01:17:24,888 --> 01:17:28,341
I, I just left the kettle
on in the kitchen, I'll just...

719
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,544
Shoo, shoo, go, get out, get out, shoo.

720
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:49,099
This is the back garden.

721
01:17:56,489 --> 01:18:00,433
- Can't seem to get this open.
- It gets jammed occasionally.

722
01:18:01,808 --> 01:18:04,149
Go and get the poker, Ethel.

723
01:18:32,857 --> 01:18:35,196
Sort of bundle under the sink here.

724
01:18:35,226 --> 01:18:37,776
What's that Mrs. Christie,
under the sink, you know?

725
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:41,427
Well take a look. It's a bundle of
something, you know what's in it?

726
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:43,198
No.

727
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,723
It's a tablecloth
or something, all wrapped up.

728
01:18:45,753 --> 01:18:48,615
- Is that yours?
- No, I don't think so.

729
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:50,687
Well feel it, feel if you recognize it.

730
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:57,170
- No, I never seen it before.
- Take it out, let's have a look at it.

731
01:18:58,944 --> 01:19:00,192
Weighs a ton.

732
01:19:11,284 --> 01:19:13,908
Better cut the cord, if
you no objection madam.

733
01:19:14,872 --> 01:19:17,454
No, not at all, it isn't mine anyway.

734
01:19:25,767 --> 01:19:28,334
- There's another one here.
- It's a baby.

735
01:19:34,845 --> 01:19:36,245
Did they ask Mr. Christie...

736
01:19:36,246 --> 01:19:39,596
if he could get the baby back
from the people in Acton, do you know?

737
01:19:44,503 --> 01:19:47,893
Well bloody hell, you going to
keep this up all the way to London?

738
01:19:55,623 --> 01:20:00,091
At 11:50 AM today I found the
dead body of your wife Beryl Evans,

739
01:20:00,121 --> 01:20:03,467
concealed in a wash-house at 10
Rillington Place, Notting Hill.

740
01:20:03,964 --> 01:20:08,019
Also, the body of your baby daughter,
Geraldine, in the same outbuilding...

741
01:20:08,049 --> 01:20:09,849
and this clothing was found on them.

742
01:20:10,432 --> 01:20:13,155
Later today, I was present
at Kensington mortuary...

743
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:17,857
when it was established that the cause
of death was strangulation in both cases.

744
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:22,608
I have reason to believe that you
were responsible for their deaths.

745
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,240
Yes.

746
01:20:44,368 --> 01:20:45,368
Right, then.

747
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:52,013
She was incurring one debt after another
and I could not stand it any longer...

748
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:57,460
so I strangled her with a piece of rope
and took her down to the flat below...

749
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:00,721
the same night whilst
the old man was in hospital.

750
01:21:01,658 --> 01:21:05,020
I waited until the Christies
downstairs had gone to bed,

751
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,353
then I took her to the
wash-house after midnight.

752
01:21:08,977 --> 01:21:14,680
Then I strangled my baby in our bedroom
with my tie and took her to the wash-house.

753
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:17,750
Sign there lad.

754
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:23,813
If you don't know how to write
your name just put a cross.

755
01:21:25,757 --> 01:21:28,907
- I know how to write my name.
- Good lad, just sign there then.

756
01:21:55,878 --> 01:22:01,735
Mr. Christie, I've got to suggest to
you and I do not want there to be...

757
01:22:01,765 --> 01:22:03,822
any misapprehensions about it...

758
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:09,316
that you are responsible for the death
of Mrs. Evans and of the little girl.

759
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:13,950
Or if that's not so, that at
least you know very much more about...

760
01:22:13,951 --> 01:22:15,736
those deaths than you've said.

761
01:22:19,005 --> 01:22:20,097
That's a lie.

762
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,141
That is a lie.

763
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:28,735
Did you know that Mrs. Evans was
pregnant in November last year?

764
01:22:29,997 --> 01:22:31,387
My wife told me.

765
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:35,018
Did you have any discussion
with her or Mr. Evans?

766
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:42,237
We understood from what Mrs. Evans
told my wife that she had been taking...

767
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:48,352
pills and various things
to procure an abortion.

768
01:22:49,288 --> 01:22:54,011
Now, I suggest to you that a
little later you said to Evans:

769
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:58,591
If you or your wife had
come to me in the first place...

770
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:02,054
I could have done
it for you without any risk.

771
01:23:03,373 --> 01:23:05,118
No, definitely not.

772
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:07,717
You remember him saying to you:

773
01:23:07,718 --> 01:23:10,569
I didn't think you knew
anything about medical stuff?

774
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:13,834
No, he...

775
01:23:13,843 --> 01:23:17,493
And that you said that you've been
training to be a doctor before the war?

776
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:19,388
No, that's nonsense.

777
01:23:20,282 --> 01:23:24,480
You remember showing Evans
some medical books in your flat?

778
01:23:24,991 --> 01:23:26,541
I've not got any medical books.

779
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:30,963
Except the St. John Ambulance handbook.

780
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:33,074
Did you show this book to Evans?

781
01:23:34,168 --> 01:23:36,218
No, certainly not, it's an obsolete book.

782
01:23:36,267 --> 01:23:38,767
I daresay it's obsolete
but did you show it to him?

783
01:23:38,834 --> 01:23:39,834
No.

784
01:23:40,663 --> 01:23:44,094
Did you not tell Evans that
you had been doing training in...

785
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:48,474
medical matters before the war and that you
stopped the training because of an accident?

786
01:23:48,522 --> 01:23:49,522
No.

787
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:57,160
You gave evidence yesterday that during
the night of Tuesday, the 8th of November...

788
01:23:57,571 --> 01:23:58,720
you heard a thud.

789
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:01,243
Yes.

790
01:24:02,847 --> 01:24:06,677
It seemed rather loud.
It startled us, rather.

791
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,925
- It woke us up.
- This was about midnight?

792
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:12,351
Oh yes, it would be.

793
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:16,705
- You quite sure about that?
- Absolutely certain.

794
01:24:17,944 --> 01:24:22,313
Do you remember giving evidence at
the Magistrate Court at West London?

795
01:24:23,164 --> 01:24:24,341
Yes.

796
01:24:24,767 --> 01:24:29,050
You never mentioned there this noise of
something very heavy being moved, did you?

797
01:24:30,029 --> 01:24:35,761
- Oh yes, I did mention it, I'm certain.
- Well, perhaps it was not taken down.

798
01:24:38,257 --> 01:24:40,785
What happened after the
sound of furniture moving?

799
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,864
I...

800
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:48,726
I went off to sleep again because of the
pain I was having with the fibrositis.

801
01:24:48,756 --> 01:24:53,037
I was taking tablets, it was the
only way I could get to sleep.

802
01:24:53,491 --> 01:24:55,641
I'm still taking them, as a matter of fact.

803
01:24:57,209 --> 01:25:00,060
Are you still suffering
from fibrositis Mr. Christie?

804
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:04,230
Very badly my lord,
I was in severe pain all night.

805
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:09,294
I had to go to the doctor again last
night and he prescribed for me and...

806
01:25:09,324 --> 01:25:11,905
gave me some pills to alleviate the pain...

807
01:25:12,501 --> 01:25:14,973
but I was awake for most of the night.

808
01:25:15,806 --> 01:25:19,125
Would you be more comfortable
giving your evidence sitting down?

809
01:25:21,111 --> 01:25:24,860
- Well yes, I think I would my lord.
- Then you may.

810
01:25:27,097 --> 01:25:28,279
Thank you.

811
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,997
Mr. Christie, yesterday you
remember Mr. Humphreys asking you...

812
01:25:47,027 --> 01:25:49,777
if you had been in the police
force during the last war?

813
01:25:50,387 --> 01:25:51,387
Yes.

814
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,596
But in fact you were a
constable in the war reserve?

815
01:25:54,597 --> 01:25:56,061
Four years, yes.

816
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,749
But you are not, are you,
a man of good character?

817
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:08,557
Well, I have had some trouble.

818
01:26:09,181 --> 01:26:12,731
I apologize for having to ask you
these questions but I'm afraid I must.

819
01:26:13,577 --> 01:26:17,861
On four occasions you've been convicted
of offenses of dishonesty, haven't you?

820
01:26:19,819 --> 01:26:22,457
- Three.
- Not four?

821
01:26:26,116 --> 01:26:28,782
Then perhaps I had better put them to you.

822
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,840
Were you sentenced to...

823
01:26:31,841 --> 01:26:34,863
three months imprisonment
in 1921 for stealing postal orders?

824
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:37,710
Yes.

825
01:26:38,795 --> 01:26:42,111
Bound over for false
pretenses in 1923 at Halifax?

826
01:26:43,163 --> 01:26:44,440
Yes, I remember that.

827
01:26:45,405 --> 01:26:50,469
Nine months hard labor for stealing
material and goods in 1924 at Uxbridge?

828
01:26:51,618 --> 01:26:52,618
Yes.

829
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:58,157
And three months also at Uxbridge
for stealing a motor car in 1933?

830
01:26:59,264 --> 01:27:00,370
Yes, that's right.

831
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:04,908
Well surely Mr. Christie, you could
remember that four offenses for dishonesty.

832
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:09,923
Well, I, I had an idea it was three. I...

833
01:27:10,519 --> 01:27:13,838
I just didn't, I just wasn't quite sure.

834
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:16,328
I see.

835
01:27:17,086 --> 01:27:22,280
But what's perhaps more
important and relevant to this matter...

836
01:27:23,015 --> 01:27:25,951
are there two other
convictions recorded against you?

837
01:27:29,058 --> 01:27:30,058
Yes.

838
01:27:31,314 --> 01:27:36,363
The first of these being
for violence at Halifax in 1923?

839
01:27:37,951 --> 01:27:38,951
Yes.

840
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:42,420
And the second
when you were sentenced to six...

841
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,895
months for malicious wounding in 1929?

842
01:27:46,746 --> 01:27:47,746
Yes.

843
01:27:50,518 --> 01:27:51,518
Yes.

844
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:04,547
Do you appreciate that the medical evidence
in this case which has been called...

845
01:28:05,128 --> 01:28:07,370
is this woman was strangled?

846
01:28:09,711 --> 01:28:11,314
I was informed of that, yes.

847
01:28:11,484 --> 01:28:15,625
Not killed by abortion, of which there's
no sign whatever, but by strangulation?

848
01:28:15,866 --> 01:28:16,866
Yes.

849
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:19,823
Now, a word about your character.

850
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:28,050
- What were you doing in the First World War?
- I was in the army in the First World War.

851
01:28:28,249 --> 01:28:30,178
- Fighting for your country?
- Yes.

852
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:33,838
I, I was gassed, twice.

853
01:28:34,716 --> 01:28:37,085
I was blinded for three months...

854
01:28:37,851 --> 01:28:41,525
and I never spoke for three and a half years.

855
01:28:43,738 --> 01:28:49,937
The last time you were in trouble with the
police for any offense was in 1933, was it?

856
01:28:50,646 --> 01:28:51,646
Yes.

857
01:28:52,859 --> 01:28:55,696
- Seventeen years ago?
- Yes.

858
01:28:56,377 --> 01:28:59,853
In this last war,
in spite of your disabilities...

859
01:29:00,307 --> 01:29:04,455
you served in the war
reserve police for many years.

860
01:29:05,271 --> 01:29:07,654
- Is that right?
- Yes, I did.

861
01:29:08,178 --> 01:29:10,760
And I was commended on two occasions.

862
01:29:12,292 --> 01:29:13,639
Thank you, Mr. Christie.

863
01:29:26,915 --> 01:29:28,191
What you doing?

864
01:29:29,426 --> 01:29:31,497
I'm going to sleep in the front room.

865
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,409
Front room?

866
01:29:37,355 --> 01:29:40,617
- On the sofa from now on.
- What's that in aid of?

867
01:29:42,264 --> 01:29:45,412
Nothing, is just that I'm not
sleeping very well, that's all.

868
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:56,339
Now...

869
01:29:57,284 --> 01:30:02,078
it is you who voluntarily go to the
police on the 30th of November...

870
01:30:02,957 --> 01:30:07,964
after hearing about the telegram which your
aunt had received from Mr. Thorley...

871
01:30:08,347 --> 01:30:09,595
your wife father?

872
01:30:10,787 --> 01:30:11,787
That's right.

873
01:30:12,092 --> 01:30:15,354
It was because your previous lies
were exposed by the telegram...

874
01:30:15,384 --> 01:30:17,634
that you decided to go to the police, was it?

875
01:30:18,323 --> 01:30:19,991
It wasn't because of the lies.

876
01:30:20,976 --> 01:30:23,126
Then why did you suddenly go to the police?

877
01:30:24,096 --> 01:30:25,096
Well...

878
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,438
I was getting worried about my daughter.

879
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,815
Are you saying that seriously to the jury?

880
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:35,829
That you go to the police
and confessed a murder...

881
01:30:36,225 --> 01:30:38,375
because you're worried about your daughter?

882
01:30:38,376 --> 01:30:41,270
With great respect, there
is no confession of murder.

883
01:30:41,828 --> 01:30:46,750
He said, I have disposed of my wife.
I have put her down the drain.

884
01:30:48,268 --> 01:30:50,410
It sounds very like murder.

885
01:30:53,588 --> 01:30:55,276
All he said was he had put her...

886
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,595
it might well be her body, down the drain.

887
01:31:02,114 --> 01:31:06,326
You made a statement to the police,
and this is the first you made...

888
01:31:07,815 --> 01:31:08,921
Exhibit 6.

889
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:13,333
In which you talk
of meeting a man in a cafe...

890
01:31:14,156 --> 01:31:16,652
and of how your wife took these pills...

891
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:21,007
and died of them and you found her dead.

892
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:24,347
Do you remember that statement?

893
01:31:25,248 --> 01:31:29,589
- Yes, I remember that statement.
- That is untrue?

894
01:31:30,822 --> 01:31:32,595
That is untrue, yes.

895
01:31:32,893 --> 01:31:36,638
You then make a statement in
which you set out in some detail...

896
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:40,983
how Mr. Christie gave your wife
something which would cause an abortion...

897
01:31:41,815 --> 01:31:43,162
and she died of that.

898
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:48,893
- You remember that one?
- Yes, I remember that one too.

899
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,722
- Is that one true or untrue?
- That is true.

900
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:59,800
Then you made a statement in which
you confessed to murdering your wife...

901
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:03,943
and your child, is that true or untrue?

902
01:32:05,574 --> 01:32:08,879
I was told of my daughter
death before I made that one.

903
01:32:09,035 --> 01:32:10,340
True or untrue?

904
01:32:15,404 --> 01:32:21,063
- It is true I made the statement.
- Is the statement true or untrue?

905
01:32:24,027 --> 01:32:25,261
Untrue.

906
01:32:25,985 --> 01:32:31,417
And then that's the second statement you've
made to the police, in some detail...

907
01:32:32,523 --> 01:32:37,176
- which is untrue.
- Yes.

908
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:41,704
So would it not be
right to say that you are a...

909
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:46,114
person who's prepared to lie or tell
the truth at your own convenience?

910
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:49,700
Well, why should I tell lies?
My life is at stake here.

911
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,239
Now...

912
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:54,381
we have shown that your story...

913
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:58,920
about Mr. Christie giving your
wife an abortion is nonsense.

914
01:32:59,913 --> 01:33:03,813
Well, you are the person who alleges
Mr. Christie is the murderer in this case.

915
01:33:05,161 --> 01:33:08,764
Can you suggest why he
should've strangled your wife?

916
01:33:13,573 --> 01:33:17,303
Well, he was...

917
01:33:19,785 --> 01:33:21,133
home all day.

918
01:33:22,112 --> 01:33:25,300
Can you suggest why he
should've strangled your wife?

919
01:33:33,912 --> 01:33:34,962
No, I can't.

920
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:41,459
Can you suggest why he
should've strangled your daughter?

921
01:33:49,727 --> 01:33:50,727
No.

922
01:33:53,571 --> 01:33:58,181
I didn't do it Auntie, Christie done it.

923
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:03,359
I didn't even know the baby was dead till
the police brought me in to Notting Hill.

924
01:34:04,408 --> 01:34:06,776
Well, Christie said she was in East Acton.

925
01:34:08,082 --> 01:34:09,472
Get Christie.

926
01:34:10,138 --> 01:34:13,515
Get him here to see me, he's the
only one who can help me now.

927
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:26,611
Timothy John Evans.

928
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:29,987
The court has found you
guilty of willful murder.

929
01:34:30,946 --> 01:34:33,146
And the sentence of the court upon you is...

930
01:34:33,147 --> 01:34:38,961
that you be taken from this place to a lawful
prison and thence to a place of execution...

931
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:42,378
and there you'll suffer death by hanging...

932
01:34:43,286 --> 01:34:46,930
and that your body be buried
within the precincts of the prison...

933
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,048
in which you shall have been last
confined before your execution.

934
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:56,335
And may the Lord have
mercy on your soul, amen.

935
01:35:34,378 --> 01:35:36,719
The one thing that sticks in my mind...

936
01:35:37,371 --> 01:35:39,521
is I'm in for something I haven't done sir.

937
01:35:41,252 --> 01:35:42,552
You must remember Evans...

938
01:35:42,553 --> 01:35:46,153
that we're not here to go into
the rights and wrongs of your case.

939
01:35:46,264 --> 01:35:51,115
- This is purely a medical board.
- Yes, I know that sir.

940
01:35:53,441 --> 01:35:54,441
See...

941
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,115
Christie done it.

942
01:35:58,832 --> 01:36:01,895
You confessed at Notting Hill, why was that?

943
01:36:03,002 --> 01:36:05,414
I broke down at Notting Hill.

944
01:36:05,612 --> 01:36:08,912
I had nothing else to worry about
when I knew my daughter was dead.

945
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:11,931
Why you think your daughter was killed?

946
01:36:15,129 --> 01:36:16,129
Well...

947
01:36:17,427 --> 01:36:19,214
to be out of the way, wasn't it?

948
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:24,775
- I see, any further questions?
- No.

949
01:36:26,179 --> 01:36:27,230
All right, thank you.

950
01:36:31,015 --> 01:36:32,902
Come along then.

951
01:36:35,257 --> 01:36:38,293
But Christie done it. I say Christie done it.

952
01:36:38,323 --> 01:36:40,179
All right, all right.

953
01:36:45,159 --> 01:36:48,152
Well, I don't know. He's not
an unpleasing little fellow.

954
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:54,297
Oh no, primitive sort of creature but
nothing abnormal, medically speaking.

955
01:36:54,904 --> 01:36:58,212
- Rather nicer than average, I thought.
- Yes.

956
01:36:58,992 --> 01:37:00,638
Nothing very much at all really.

957
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:04,779
Certainly no medical grounds for a reprieve.

958
01:38:06,154 --> 01:38:07,154
Oh.

959
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:03,943
Supper is in the meat safe.

960
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:08,812
I should've thought you
could've got it for yourself.

961
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:14,810
I'm going to bed now.
I've taken a sleeping pill.

962
01:39:17,689 --> 01:39:19,675
I'm going to Sheffield in the morning.

963
01:39:23,618 --> 01:39:26,569
- Sheffield?
- To stay with Jessy and Bob.

964
01:39:26,966 --> 01:39:28,653
You can't just leave me here.

965
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:32,114
I can't stand Jessy you know
that, she talks too much.

966
01:39:32,483 --> 01:39:34,205
What am I meant to do then?

967
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:37,842
We no friends.

968
01:39:40,384 --> 01:39:43,646
Not a soul set foot in this
house for two years nearly.

969
01:39:45,093 --> 01:39:49,228
Not since the Evanses, we've no money.

970
01:39:50,413 --> 01:39:53,763
- You haven't worked since I don't know when.
- I can't work, can I?

971
01:39:53,764 --> 01:39:57,364
Not with my back and everything,
the doctor says I should be in hospital.

972
01:39:57,506 --> 01:39:59,177
I know where you should be.

973
01:40:00,472 --> 01:40:04,795
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.

974
01:41:23,454 --> 01:41:24,454
Oh...

975
01:42:15,265 --> 01:42:16,695
You don't mind, do you?

976
01:42:33,852 --> 01:42:35,407
It's migraine.

977
01:42:35,656 --> 01:42:39,689
- I get these terrible headaches.
- Very unpleasant. Oh, very unpleasant.

978
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:41,138
Mind you...

979
01:42:42,285 --> 01:42:49,206
medically speaking of course, it's a very
interesting condition syndrome as we call it.

980
01:42:50,852 --> 01:42:52,956
You're not a doctor, are you?

981
01:42:54,427 --> 01:42:58,153
Well, now how did you know that?
Well, I should've say, I was.

982
01:42:58,183 --> 01:43:01,633
- Was?
- Yes, I...

983
01:43:02,892 --> 01:43:07,975
I did a favor for a friend, a lady friend. I
expect you understand. You know how it is.

984
01:43:08,005 --> 01:43:10,756
Oh yes. Oh dear.

985
01:43:11,243 --> 01:43:13,643
- Can I get you another cup of tea?
- No, thanks.

986
01:43:13,644 --> 01:43:14,887
You sure?

987
01:43:18,201 --> 01:43:21,855
Yes, well of course, they
won't do you any good, mind.

988
01:43:22,468 --> 01:43:26,610
- What does though?
- Well, if only I was free to...

989
01:43:28,392 --> 01:43:30,423
Honestly, I'd do anything.

990
01:44:08,824 --> 01:44:11,374
You certainly do yourself
proud in here, I must say.

991
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:13,476
- My wife is away.
- I don't blame her.

992
01:44:14,124 --> 01:44:17,925
You can keep that mattress for a start.
I've the whole shop running alive.

993
01:44:18,107 --> 01:44:20,057
- What's that meant to mean?
- Bed bugs.

994
01:44:20,729 --> 01:44:23,048
Look, this is mahogany, pure mahogany.

995
01:44:23,078 --> 01:44:25,144
Oh, yeah? Ten quid the lot.

996
01:44:25,802 --> 01:44:27,764
- What? For everything?
- Everything, but that mattress.

997
01:44:27,765 --> 01:44:29,965
- That will walk out by itself.
- Ten pounds?

998
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:32,788
- Surely it must be worth 15.
- Not to me, it isn't.

999
01:44:32,789 --> 01:44:37,498
- Why, I can't work I was wounded in the war.
- That's tough luck, squire.

1000
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,914
Twelve is my top. Yes or no?

1001
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:46,470
- All right.
- I'll have the van round up this afternoon.

1002
01:44:46,471 --> 01:44:50,491
One, two, three.

1003
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:35,493
I was just looking through my papers.

1004
01:45:35,844 --> 01:45:38,115
Cuttings and things, newspaper cuttings.

1005
01:45:38,795 --> 01:45:41,326
Founds in all the papers a few years back.

1006
01:45:44,253 --> 01:45:45,615
Murder trial it was.

1007
01:45:46,511 --> 01:45:49,007
Dreadful business, appalling.

1008
01:45:50,483 --> 01:45:55,090
Of course, I was in the police once so I...

1009
01:45:55,555 --> 01:45:57,496
understand these things.

1010
01:46:02,092 --> 01:46:04,043
I have had a very...

1011
01:46:05,495 --> 01:46:07,538
varied life.

1012
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:11,981
Funny really.

1013
01:46:14,812 --> 01:46:17,616
In all the papers a few years back and now...

1014
01:46:19,998 --> 01:46:20,998
Pig.

1015
01:46:28,123 --> 01:46:30,923
Well of course, if that's
the way you're going to talk...

1016
01:46:32,911 --> 01:46:35,158
It was what I expect, of course.

1017
01:46:51,896 --> 01:46:53,437
Ok, just dump it here.

1018
01:46:55,027 --> 01:46:58,477
- Really smells bad in here.
- We'll soon get it cleaned up.

1019
01:47:54,617 --> 01:47:55,617
Cliff?

1020
01:47:57,136 --> 01:47:58,339
Go and get the police.

1021
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:59,454
What are you doing? Looking for work?

1022
01:49:02,097 --> 01:49:04,878
My employment cards haven't come through.

1023
01:49:05,684 --> 01:49:08,952
- Well, what's your name?
- John Waddington.

1024
01:49:10,325 --> 01:49:12,875
Have you got anything
on you to prove your identity?

1025
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:16,548
- No, nothing at all.
- Take your hat off, will you?

1026
01:49:30,365 --> 01:49:33,633
You're Christie, John Reginald Christie.

1027
01:49:36,832 --> 01:49:38,732
I shall have to take you into custody.

1028
01:49:39,736 --> 01:49:40,736
Come along.
