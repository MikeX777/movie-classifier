1
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,612
Rigo.

2
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,626
Come on, Jackson.

3
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:51,105
Sorry, girl.

4
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,708
BP, this is Jim Hanson.

5
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,379
I've got four or five IAs

6
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,464
heading north out near my ranch,

7
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,134
about a half-mile from the fence.

8
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:19,176
Over.

9
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,430
Copy that, Jim.

10
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,931
Agents on the way.

11
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:41,806
Water.

12
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,542
Easy. Easy.

13
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:57,046
Hanson here. Better send a medic out.

14
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:58,923
Found one left behind. Over.

15
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:02,862
You James Hanson?

16
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,031
Who's asking?

17
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:07,784
Carl Neeham, from Pima
County Merchants Bank.

18
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,748
It's a Notice of Trustee's sale.

19
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,501
Let you know that the ranch is
to be sold at auction in 90 days.

20
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,044
What?

21
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:19,838
Law requires you be notified.

22
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,465
I'd have called, but I couldn't
find a phone listing for you.

23
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,510
I was in last month, explained
my situation to Ned Fremont.

24
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:26,761
- He assured me...
- Yes, well,

25
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:28,180
Ned's no longer with us.

26
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,073
Not sure why he didn't follow it,

27
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,418
but bank policy is to take action

28
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:33,404
if there hasn't been a
payment in over six months.

29
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:36,663
You should also know, Mr. Hanson,

30
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:39,408
that the bank has the right to sell
the property before those 90 days

31
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,685
if it receives a reasonable
offer from a third party.

32
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:49,160
Mr. Hanson?

33
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,662
That hill over there...

34
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:56,457
Spread my wife's ashes
on top of it last year.

35
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:01,213
I'm sorry for your loss.

36
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:03,256
- Look, Mister...
- Neeham.

37
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,259
I'm no deadbeat.

38
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,928
I just a need a little time to
sort things out, get back on track.

39
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,349
Yeah, like I said, you've got
90 days, you know, most likely.

40
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,436
My number's on there
if you have any questions.

41
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:17,937
You have yourself a good evening.

42
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:29,073
Frame's almost built, and I
got to watch my budget and all.

43
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,327
Anyway, don't you have a ranch to run?

44
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:32,911
Sold most of it off.

45
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,580
Down to the last few head of cattle.

46
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,833
Christine's medical bills wiped me out.

47
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,419
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

48
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,923
I can dig that hole for you.
It'll be done by sundown.

49
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:51,554
I wouldn't be asking if
I didn't need the job.

50
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,225
Look, Jim, that kind of
work is not for someone...

51
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,144
Someone my age? Come on, Randall.

52
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:58,895
You know I can outwork any man here.

53
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:02,524
Listen, I got a new
project starting next month.

54
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:05,026
Come see me then, I'll see
what I can find for you, okay?

55
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,695
Yeah. Okay.

56
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,246
I was out your way last week.

57
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,123
Things are looking mighty lean.

58
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:19,291
Tell me about it.

59
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:22,419
At 70 cents per pound,

60
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:26,756
we're talking 17 grand.

61
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:28,425
Could you make it 20?

62
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:31,845
There's not a lot of profit selling
underweight cattle, you know.

63
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:36,392
I'm sorry, Jim.

64
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,352
Let me know what you decide, buddy.

65
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,424
Sorry to bother you, Sarah.
I thought you'd want to know.

66
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,883
I appreciate it, Angie.

67
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:12,927
Yeah. It's been a long time
since I've seen him here.

68
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:19,601
Hey, there, stranger.

69
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,688
Hey, Sarah.

70
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:27,359
- This seat taken?
- It's for you.

71
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:29,611
Drink?

72
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:31,405
No, thanks.

73
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:34,991
Thanks for the call yesterday.

74
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,787
A few more hours, that fella
would've been one for the coroner.

75
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:40,955
His lucky day, I guess.

76
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:44,459
Not sure he sees it that way.

77
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,296
Walked all the way from Honduras,

78
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,298
spent his life savings on a coyote

79
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,591
who left him in the middle of nowhere.

80
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:53,760
All for naught.

81
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,138
Yeah, it's a cruel world.

82
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,518
That pass has kept us busy all week.

83
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:04,646
The cartels are running
everything through there.

84
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:06,815
Drugs, people, guns.

85
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:08,650
What else is new?

86
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:10,236
I worry about you,

87
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:14,072
out there on the front
lines, all by yourself.

88
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:18,327
It would be fine if the government
would get its shit together

89
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:20,078
and figure that mess out.

90
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:27,836
What is going on?

91
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,256
What are you doing back here?

92
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,970
Been wondering that myself.

93
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,307
What the hell am I doing?

94
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:45,229
I guess I'm trying to understand

95
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,646
how you work your whole life,

96
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:49,233
serve your country, pay your taxes,

97
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:52,194
and end up without a pot to piss in.

98
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,989
Lost my home,

99
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:57,532
my livelihood,

100
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:04,497
and the only person that
made any of it worthwhile.

101
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:14,007
Come on, let's... let's get you back.

102
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:17,178
Come on.

103
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,561
There we go.

104
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:44,788
Leave it, Sarah. Just leave it.

105
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:03,807
I like to remember her like this.

106
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,684
Smiling, laughing.

107
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:13,150
I've never seen my mom so happy
as the day she married you.

108
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,653
Wasn't right, her going
out the way she did.

109
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:19,739
Watching her suffer like that.

110
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,618
I couldn't imagine anything worse.

111
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:25,537
Now I know.

112
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,709
Come on.

113
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,712
Let's get you to bed.

114
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,509
Come on, Pops.

115
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:43,888
Rest these old bones.

116
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,858
It wasn't right, Sarah.

117
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,070
I miss her, too.

118
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:00,613
Yeah?

119
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:08,872
Rest up.

120
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:10,123
Yeah.

121
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,693
Who's the best dog in the world?

122
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:14,814
Mom.

123
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:51,701
Who's a good boy?

124
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,330
Jackson is. Jackie...

125
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:05,799
Hey, hey! Wait, wait!

126
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,052
You're never going to make
it through there like that.

127
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,805
It's miles to the nearest road.

128
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:12,872
Do you understand?

129
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,226
You... You will help us?

130
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,353
I'll call the Border Patrol.

131
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,687
No! Sir, sir, sir, please! Please!

132
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:21,440
No. No Border Patrol.

133
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,486
I pay you.

134
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:27,821
What?

135
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,739
To help us, I pay you.

136
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,783
I'm not a smuggler, lady.

137
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,493
Border Patrol will help you out.

138
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,537
- No!
- Listen, get you to a doctor.

139
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,497
Please, sir! No, no!

140
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,877
Please. Please!

141
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:45,672
Please!

142
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:47,715
Dispatch, this is Jim Hanson.

143
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,136
Go ahead, Jim.

144
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:52,595
I've got two IAs,

145
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,639
about a klick south of Stone Ridge.

146
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:57,725
Copy that.

147
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,228
We're spread thin right now.

148
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,520
It'll be a few.

149
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,563
Ten-four.

150
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,774
I'll get you some water.

151
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:05,550
Mom.

152
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:12,699
Jackson, stay.

153
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,445
Speak in English.

154
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,049
I come here to take the woman and the boy.

155
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,637
Sorry, Pancho. These illegals are mine.

156
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:38,808
You are Border Patrol?

157
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,060
Marine Corps.

158
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:46,566
So you are keeping your country safe

159
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:49,486
all by yourself, Marine Corps?

160
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,613
Something like that.

161
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:59,037
I am a soldier, too.

162
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,665
My orders are to take them back with me.

163
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,044
You're no soldier.

164
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:08,963
And I don't scare easy.

165
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:12,091
Now I've already called the cavalry,

166
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:15,887
so I suggest y'all just
turn around and adiós.

167
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,146
I am not going to ask again.

168
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,274
The woman and the boy.

169
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,775
Hand them over.

170
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:35,532
This ain't worth it, boys.

171
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,371
Give them to me!

172
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,273
Get in the truck. Move.

173
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,827
Mom! Mom!

174
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:41,265
Oh, shit.

175
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,308
Stay down.

176
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:47,020
Jackson, quiet.

177
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,104
Jackson!

178
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,773
Dispatch, this is Hanson.

179
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,401
I've just taken heavy fire.

180
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:53,526
I've got a wounded...

181
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,292
Boss.

182
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,717
Your brother...

183
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:36,845
He's dead.

184
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:59,467
Okay, let's...

185
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:01,886
Nice and easy.

186
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:06,641
Sir...

187
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,686
They take him, they kill him.

188
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:12,772
No, look, those guys
are gone. They're gone.

189
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:14,275
No, please.

190
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,402
All I have...

191
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:18,778
It's yours... To help him.

192
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:22,699
This...

193
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:25,660
My cousin...

194
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:27,912
In Chicago.

195
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:31,375
Please.

196
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,418
Mamá.

197
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,280
My love.

198
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:40,534
My love.

199
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:42,952
Come here.

200
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,127
You're going to stay with this man, OK?

201
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,586
Take this.

202
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,111
Sir...

203
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,406
Please.

204
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:05,867
Please.

205
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:09,205
Mamá.

206
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:10,622
Mamá.

207
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:57,961
It doesn't make sense.

208
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:00,256
No point trying to understand the cartels.

209
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:01,714
Better just to avoid them.

210
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,092
What's going to happen to the kid?

211
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,887
Unaccompanied minors are
sent to holding in Nogales.

212
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,028
He most likely will end up in foster care.

213
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,271
Diaz.

214
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,689
What was the boy talking about?

215
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,735
He said if you hadn't stopped them,

216
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:24,363
his mother would still be alive.

217
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,952
Hey, he's just a kid.

218
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:38,460
Jim, I need you to come by the
station and make a statement.

219
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,898
Good boy, Jackson.

220
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:37,144
Good morning, babe.

221
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:42,191
Get some grub?

222
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:43,733
Let's get some grub.

223
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:47,381
Good boy.

224
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:11,696
All I have is yours.

225
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:13,740
They take him, they kill him.

226
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,326
Please. Please.

227
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,618
God damn it!

228
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:11,589
Denny, that kid whose
mother died last night,

229
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:13,842
has he been sent on to Nogales yet?

230
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:16,178
No, he's being deported.

231
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,388
What?

232
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,556
Mexican authorities say he's got a relative

233
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,183
waiting for him on the other side.

234
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:25,103
I need to see him.

235
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:27,564
Sorry, Jim, can't do that.

236
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,107
Just a few minutes.

237
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,608
I already cleared it with Sarah.

238
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,776
Call her and check.

239
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:45,416
- Make it quick.
- Thanks.

240
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,132
Hey, come on.

241
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,429
You're not safe here, comprende?

242
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,181
Let's go, come on.

243
00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:36,508
Come on.

244
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,325
Hey.

245
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,422
Tell the others, we're crossing.

246
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:46,119
Stay here, understand?

247
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:48,955
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

248
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,079
God damn it.

249
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,590
Gentlemen.

250
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,592
Passports and visas, please.

251
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,058
Open the back, please.

252
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:09,869
All clear!

253
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:16,651
Go ahead.

254
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,316
- What the hell you doing?
- Let me go.

255
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,943
Listen to me or you're
going to get yourself killed.

256
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:44,321
They send you back, those
men are there waiting for you.

257
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:45,096
Understand?

258
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:47,782
Come on.

259
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:22,443
What?

260
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,072
I'm doing what your mother asked.

261
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:30,658
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.

262
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,371
You know, Chicago?

263
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:36,315
Family.

264
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:42,795
Hell, you don't understand
a damn word I'm saying.

265
00:35:58,598 --> 00:36:00,892
Hey, you hungry?

266
00:36:02,144 --> 00:36:03,645
Thirsty?

267
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,190
Food.

268
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:07,441
Comida.

269
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:08,691
Yeah?

270
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,539
Hey. What's the matter?
You got to be hungry.

271
00:36:41,308 --> 00:36:43,144
That's what I thought.

272
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:52,491
There's a storm, it's on its way

273
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,567
In the end

274
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,361
Yes, in the end

275
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,753
Everybody's gonna pay

276
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:34,068
- Hey.
- Hello.

277
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:36,405
I need to buy an atlas.

278
00:37:36,446 --> 00:37:37,947
- A what?
- An atlas.

279
00:37:38,365 --> 00:37:41,034
Like a map book. With all the states.

280
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:45,747
You could try looking on
that bottom left shelf over there.

281
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:48,917
We don't really sell maps much anymore.

282
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,669
Everyone pretty much just
googles it on their phone.

283
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:54,340
Hey, hey!

284
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,134
My lucky day.

285
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:58,177
How about that?

286
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:01,596
You going on a road trip?

287
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,224
Yeah, something like that.

288
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:06,310
There's no price on this.

289
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,312
It's probably outdated.

290
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:10,104
You can have it on the house.

291
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:11,648
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

292
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:14,734
Thank you.

293
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:16,611
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

294
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:05,743
Sarah Reynolds.

295
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:07,036
Sarah, it's Jim.

296
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:08,997
Thank God.

297
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,707
You all right?

298
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

299
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,211
Just called to tell you not to worry.

300
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:16,589
What the hell were you
thinking, taking that kid?

301
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:19,674
They were going to kill him,
the ones who killed his mother.

302
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:22,051
They were waiting for him at the border.

303
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,762
So you don't come to me
with that information?

304
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,598
You just take him and leave?

305
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,268
Christ, Jim, you put
my ass on the line here.

306
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:33,771
I can only keep this
thing quiet for so long.

307
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:36,691
I need you to bring back that kid.

308
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,067
Now.

309
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,903
I... I can't do that.

310
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,322
Why not?

311
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:43,282
His mom, she...

312
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:44,949
We made, like, a deal.

313
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:47,203
Jim...

314
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,454
Listen.

315
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:52,166
We sent agents up to your house.

316
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,083
It was burned to the ground.

317
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:57,921
Whoever these guys were at the
border, they're not messing around.

318
00:39:58,214 --> 00:40:00,174
Now tell me where the hell you are.

319
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:02,592
I'll call you later.

320
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:04,469
Jim...

321
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:11,726
God damn it!

322
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:15,147
Why the hell did you
have to cross my property?

323
00:40:15,189 --> 00:40:18,192
You damn well ought to
appreciate what I'm doing for you.

324
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:23,655
I don't even want to be
in your stupid country.

325
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:33,207
Well, well, well. He speaks.

326
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:37,211
Hey, Jackson, you hear that?

327
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,772
I want to go home.

328
00:40:59,649 --> 00:41:01,901
Look, it's not safe for you there.

329
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:03,611
Why are you doing this?

330
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:05,530
Because your mother asked me to help.

331
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:07,782
Why did you call the Border Patrol on us?

332
00:41:07,824 --> 00:41:10,411
Because I didn't want to
find your bodies on my land.

333
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,330
If you want to help me,
you could take me back.

334
00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:14,998
I'll find my own way home.

335
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:18,127
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.

336
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:20,545
After that, I don't
give a shit what you do.

337
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:25,633
Look...

338
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:30,139
It may not seem like it right
now, but this is what's best.

339
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,186
And I'm sorry.

340
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,314
I'm sorry what happened
to your mom and all.

341
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,155
Shit.

342
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:06,758
I gotta go, Mom. Bye.

343
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,288
Do you speak Spanish, queen?

344
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:13,390
No, sorry.

345
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:20,688
I come here looking for a man and a boy.

346
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:23,691
And they drive a...

347
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:25,527
Truck...

348
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:27,404
A pickup truck.

349
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,738
Yeah, he was here.

350
00:42:29,406 --> 00:42:30,740
He was on a road trip.

351
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,033
You know where?

352
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:33,535
No, sorry.

353
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:40,542
Do you know, which direction he go?

354
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,835
I didn't notice.

355
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,586
Sorry.

356
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:51,220
Was he here?

357
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:53,389
That's not... That's not
really what that's for...

358
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,858
Show me.

359
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:48,277
This is just about dry.

360
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,069
You're lucky the block didn't crack.

361
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:52,781
You see, it's leaking around the core.

362
00:43:52,822 --> 00:43:54,866
There's something lodged in here.

363
00:43:55,658 --> 00:43:56,785
Looks like a slug.

364
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,290
Someone using your truck
for target practice?

365
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:04,168
Yeah, something like that.
Can you replace the radiator?

366
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,585
Yeah, sure.

367
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:07,213
Take a day or two to get the part.

368
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,173
We can't wait around that long.

369
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:11,758
I wouldn't drive it the way it
is. You could blow your engine.

370
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:15,429
I suppose I could probably
patch it temporarily

371
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,806
so that you could get where you are going.

372
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:19,015
Great.

373
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,601
- See you tomorrow.
- What?

374
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:25,189
It's after 6:00. We're closed.

375
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:29,567
Pima County Merchants Bank.

376
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,569
You may enter an extension at any time.

377
00:44:33,488 --> 00:44:35,657
You've reached the
voicemail of Carl Neeham.

378
00:44:35,698 --> 00:44:36,825
Please leave a message.

379
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:38,327
Yeah, Mr. Neeham...

380
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:43,374
Mr. Neeham, it's Jim Hanson here.

381
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:45,500
Listen, I was able to work something out.

382
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:48,086
If you can give me
just a few more days,

383
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:51,382
I can come in and make
things current on my loan.

384
00:44:52,258 --> 00:44:53,967
Thanks.

385
00:44:59,306 --> 00:45:02,268
Okay. Double whiskey and a Coke.

386
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:04,270
You boys ready to order?

387
00:45:04,311 --> 00:45:06,230
I'll have the steak. Rare.

388
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:08,440
And for the young man?

389
00:45:10,066 --> 00:45:11,985
Can I have a hamburger?

390
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:14,238
Thank you.

391
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:15,738
Thanks.

392
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,617
Where'd you learn to speak English?

393
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:21,703
School.

394
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:25,498
Must have been a good student.

395
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:29,336
My mom, she made me study a lot.

396
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:33,215
Those men at the border,

397
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:34,883
you know why they were after you?

398
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:37,677
My Uncle Carlos.

399
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,097
He did something that made the cartel mad.

400
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:44,642
Called my mom and said we had to leave.

401
00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:49,481
What about your dad?

402
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,108
He's dead.

403
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:53,319
Died before I was born.

404
00:45:57,739 --> 00:45:58,990
Your name is Miguel?

405
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,618
Yes.

406
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,162
Jim.

407
00:46:14,547 --> 00:46:16,342
I need to go.

408
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,430
Oh, yeah. Go on.

409
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:06,267
Jim.

410
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:09,186
Jim.

411
00:47:17,694 --> 00:47:19,028
Jackson.

412
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:21,240
Good boy.

413
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:12,832
Jackson?

414
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:28,932
Little shit!

415
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:43,571
I'll do the shopping from here on.

416
00:48:53,415 --> 00:48:55,959
Yeah, no guarantees on that, yeah?

417
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,002
If I were you, I'd get
the whole thing replaced

418
00:48:58,044 --> 00:49:00,463
when you get back home, wherever home is.

419
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:01,548
Yeah, will do.

420
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:03,675
How old's your boy?

421
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:08,054
He's not my kid.

422
00:49:33,372 --> 00:49:34,914
You know how to read that thing?

423
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:45,049
We're...

424
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:47,178
We're around here some place.

425
00:50:14,938 --> 00:50:15,689
Hello.

426
00:50:43,442 --> 00:50:44,859
Can I help you?

427
00:50:50,265 --> 00:50:50,974
Boss.

428
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:52,892
Boss.

429
00:50:58,357 --> 00:51:01,109
The card was used 20 miles west of here.

430
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:18,685
If you had a phone,

431
00:51:18,726 --> 00:51:20,326
we could have looked up the fastest way.

432
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:22,939
So I hear.

433
00:51:24,983 --> 00:51:27,444
Why do you not have one?
Is it because you're old?

434
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:29,196
What?

435
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:31,157
Some old people don't like phones.

436
00:51:32,199 --> 00:51:33,741
No, that's not it.

437
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:37,829
Nobody needs to call me,
and I like it that way.

438
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:45,962
Do you think I'll like it in Chicago?

439
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:48,840
Don't know why not.

440
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:53,345
I spent some time there one
summer when I was about your age.

441
00:51:55,222 --> 00:51:56,556
I remember...

442
00:51:57,183 --> 00:51:58,392
I remember how green it was.

443
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:00,977
And the hot dogs.

444
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:02,354
You like hot dogs?

445
00:52:03,605 --> 00:52:05,232
You'll like these.

446
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:07,817
Chicago's famous for them.

447
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,069
No ketchup, though.

448
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,448
Mustard, pickles, that sort of thing.

449
00:52:14,115 --> 00:52:16,285
Never had one as good anywhere else.

450
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:34,594
What the hell?

451
00:52:59,994 --> 00:53:01,330
Stay calm and be quiet.

452
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:07,460
Your license, please.

453
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:12,569
Looks like you had a little incident.

454
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:13,887
Yeah.

455
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:19,639
How are you there today, young man?

456
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:22,934
Okay.

457
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:26,230
Any weapons on you, sir?

458
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:29,691
I've got a .45 under the
seat and a rifle in the back.

459
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:30,775
Both registered.

460
00:53:32,026 --> 00:53:33,528
Step out of the vehicle, please.

461
00:53:35,197 --> 00:53:36,656
I didn't think I was speeding.

462
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:37,991
Is there a problem?

463
00:53:38,032 --> 00:53:39,632
I just want to have a word with the boy.

464
00:53:39,657 --> 00:53:41,158
It'll only take a minute.

465
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,505
Jackson, stay.

466
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:01,848
Walk back to my vehicle, please.

467
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:05,935
Go ahead and have a seat in the back.

468
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:38,135
Conley, you out there?

469
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,224
I got tired of waiting and ate without you.

470
00:55:01,825 --> 00:55:04,828
Go ahead and have a seat in your
truck while I run your information.

471
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:11,335
Can I have my keys so I can run the A/C?

472
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:13,295
It'll only take a minute.

473
00:55:14,003 --> 00:55:15,463
Jackson... Come on.

474
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:16,548
Come on.

475
00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:19,551
You... You didn't talk to the boy.

476
00:55:21,303 --> 00:55:22,346
What?

477
00:55:22,388 --> 00:55:25,141
You said you wanted a word with the
boy, but you didn't speak to him.

478
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:27,725
Get in the truck.

479
00:55:38,027 --> 00:55:39,070
How much?

480
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:40,613
Excuse me?

481
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:43,367
How much are they paying
you to betray that badge?

482
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:44,826
Get in the truck.

483
00:55:44,868 --> 00:55:46,548
You turn us over to them, they'll kill us.

484
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:48,621
Get in the fucking truck!

485
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:25,284
Miguel, back in the truck! Now!

486
00:56:58,317 --> 00:56:59,360
Wait here.

487
00:57:20,214 --> 00:57:21,215
What's up?

488
00:57:26,345 --> 00:57:27,388
Stay down.

489
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:30,790
Where is he?

490
00:57:31,558 --> 00:57:32,600
Hey!

491
00:57:33,335 --> 00:57:33,960
Where is he?

492
00:57:34,353 --> 00:57:36,513
- I don't... What? I don't understand...
- Where is he?

493
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,018
- Where? Where? Where?
- I don't know!

494
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:47,991
Don't look.

495
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:15,001
Let's go.

496
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:39,709
Come on.

497
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:55,475
I'll be right back.

498
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:01,398
That'll be fine.

499
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:06,528
If you're paying cash,
I can do 900 for both.

500
00:59:07,238 --> 00:59:08,530
Ammo is on the house.

501
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:10,448
- Sounds fair enough.
- Need some ID.

502
00:59:12,033 --> 00:59:14,161
Devil Dog?

503
00:59:14,203 --> 00:59:15,578
'Nam?

504
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,788
Two tours.

505
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,582
I had a brother over there.

506
00:59:19,624 --> 00:59:21,252
He didn't make it back.

507
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:23,920
Sorry to hear that.

508
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:25,422
We lost some good men.

509
00:59:25,463 --> 00:59:27,048
We did.

510
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,716
Got to run a background check.

511
00:59:28,758 --> 00:59:31,428
Normally doesn't take too
long, but the computer's down.

512
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:34,223
Might be a few hours,
tomorrow at the latest.

513
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:36,433
I... I can't wait.

514
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:38,852
You see, I'm just passing through, and...

515
00:59:38,893 --> 00:59:42,730
I'm sorry, I can't risk losing my license.

516
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:47,735
Look, I'm no criminal,

517
00:59:47,777 --> 00:59:50,864
but someone's after me,
and I need to watch my back.

518
00:59:50,905 --> 00:59:52,324
The police can't help me.

519
00:59:52,366 --> 00:59:54,576
I know it's asking a lot, but...

520
00:59:54,617 --> 00:59:56,119
It's life or death.

521
00:59:58,205 --> 01:00:00,582
Something bad happens,

522
01:00:00,623 --> 01:00:02,418
these end up in the wrong hands...

523
01:00:06,463 --> 01:00:08,257
I'll report them stolen.

524
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,427
I understand. Thanks.

525
01:00:13,928 --> 01:00:15,889
This trouble you're in...

526
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:17,474
That your own doing?

527
01:00:18,142 --> 01:00:19,185
Not exactly,

528
01:00:19,226 --> 01:00:23,521
but I made a choice, and
I got to live with it.

529
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:25,899
So long as it's for the right reasons.

530
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:34,449
Sarah, Jim's on the phone.

531
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,036
Listen, the DEA says

532
01:00:38,077 --> 01:00:41,373
the man you saw at the
border is Mauricio Guerrero.

533
01:00:41,415 --> 01:00:44,542
Recruited as a kid, soldiering
for the cartel ever since.

534
01:00:44,584 --> 01:00:47,045
And the man that you
shot? That was his brother.

535
01:00:47,504 --> 01:00:49,923
Jeez.

536
01:00:49,964 --> 01:00:52,008
Mexican police have a source that said

537
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,637
that kid's uncle stole money
from the Vasquez Cartel.

538
01:00:55,678 --> 01:00:57,597
Found him hanging from an overpass.

539
01:00:58,556 --> 01:01:01,059
I don't know exactly what
you've got going on here,

540
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,061
but it is not worth it.

541
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,357
This Mauricio will find you,

542
01:01:06,398 --> 01:01:08,317
and when he does,

543
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:11,444
he will kill you and that boy.

544
01:01:14,198 --> 01:01:15,782
It's time to let this go.

545
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,501
Jim?

546
01:01:26,543 --> 01:01:28,337
Yeah, yeah, all right.

547
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:29,796
I'll bring him in.

548
01:01:31,132 --> 01:01:32,507
Where are you?

549
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:35,051
In the Texas Panhandle somewhere.

550
01:01:35,093 --> 01:01:37,346
A town called Weyburn.

551
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:40,557
Okay, find the local sheriff's
office. They'll get you back here.

552
01:01:40,598 --> 01:01:43,227
No, I can't trust them.

553
01:01:43,518 --> 01:01:44,561
Fine.

554
01:01:44,602 --> 01:01:47,063
Then I'll come myself.

555
01:01:47,105 --> 01:01:48,648
Just...

556
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,890
Just stay off the streets,
and lay low till I get there.

557
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,610
Can you please do that for me?

558
01:01:52,652 --> 01:01:53,820
Yeah.

559
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,577
What do you think?

560
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,455
- Okay.
- Yeah?

561
01:02:15,342 --> 01:02:16,926
Here you go.

562
01:02:37,071 --> 01:02:38,199
Why are we parking here?

563
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:41,534
I think it best we stay out of sight.

564
01:02:41,576 --> 01:02:43,077
Come on, take your bag.

565
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:50,543
I'd like a room, please.

566
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:52,296
$39 plus tax.

567
01:02:52,338 --> 01:02:54,381
Credit card and ID, please.

568
01:03:02,806 --> 01:03:03,890
Will this do?

569
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,565
Go on, get yourself cleaned up.

570
01:03:35,964 --> 01:03:37,341
You're welcome.

571
01:03:40,593 --> 01:03:43,805
I'll get some salt for the eggs.

572
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:45,224
Forget the salt.

573
01:03:50,187 --> 01:03:51,729
Do you think they'll marry?

574
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:55,817
I don't know.

575
01:03:57,278 --> 01:03:59,070
I suppose they might.

576
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:02,324
I have a girlfriend at home.

577
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:04,534
Someday, I'll marry her.

578
01:04:07,204 --> 01:04:09,206
Do you have a wife?

579
01:04:09,248 --> 01:04:10,832
Not anymore.

580
01:04:10,874 --> 01:04:12,750
What happened?

581
01:04:13,543 --> 01:04:15,212
She died.

582
01:04:15,254 --> 01:04:17,131
Cancer. Shitty disease.

583
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:23,678
They say you get used to
being alone after a while.

584
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:28,558
That's just crap.

585
01:04:31,811 --> 01:04:33,272
You could get a girlfriend.

586
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:37,525
I don't think so.

587
01:04:37,567 --> 01:04:39,361
I'm not young and handsome like you.

588
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:48,162
When we get to Chicago,

589
01:04:48,204 --> 01:04:51,415
the first thing I want
to do is eat a hot dog.

590
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:00,840
Look, Miguel...

591
01:05:10,058 --> 01:05:13,102
It's late. Maybe you ought
to get some sleep?

592
01:05:35,834 --> 01:05:37,544
Want to go out, boy?

593
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:04,070
Jackson. Jackson!

594
01:06:09,784 --> 01:06:12,120
Miguel, wake up. We have to go.

595
01:06:19,878 --> 01:06:22,131
911, what's your emergency?

596
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:24,674
There's a robbery in progress
here at the Blackwood Motel

597
01:06:24,716 --> 01:06:25,925
on Route 12.

598
01:06:25,967 --> 01:06:27,844
There's at least three men with guns.

599
01:06:27,886 --> 01:06:30,306
Three men, sir? Can you describe these men?

600
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,225
Hello?

601
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:39,356
Go.

602
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:47,781
Hello, sir? Hello?

603
01:06:47,822 --> 01:06:49,741
Sir, are you okay?

604
01:07:15,517 --> 01:07:17,228
Marine Corps!

605
01:07:19,438 --> 01:07:21,648
You killed my brother!

606
01:07:24,734 --> 01:07:28,029
You can't hide forever, Marine Corps!

607
01:07:53,555 --> 01:07:56,057
The truck is right through there.

608
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:59,060
Go get in it and wait for me.

609
01:07:59,102 --> 01:08:01,104
- Okay?
- Where are you going?

610
01:08:01,146 --> 01:08:02,897
I got to get my dog.

611
01:08:02,939 --> 01:08:04,566
Go now. I'll be there in a minute.

612
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,828
Jackson, no.

613
01:09:29,484 --> 01:09:31,528
He's in heaven now.

614
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:33,155
No such thing.

615
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,160
Just something people tell
you to make you feel better.

616
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:42,622
My dog's nowhere but buried,
and that ain't where he belongs.

617
01:09:42,664 --> 01:09:46,168
You might as well get that heaven
crap out of your head right now.

618
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:47,253
You are wrong.

619
01:09:47,294 --> 01:09:48,962
The only thing I was wrong about

620
01:09:49,003 --> 01:09:51,005
was driving your ass across the country.

621
01:09:51,673 --> 01:09:53,007
I'm taking you back.

622
01:09:56,553 --> 01:09:58,347
I know about the money.

623
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:03,352
I looked in the bag.

624
01:10:05,728 --> 01:10:06,729
Get in the truck!

625
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:14,529
Miguel!

626
01:10:18,325 --> 01:10:19,701
Miguel!

627
01:10:41,348 --> 01:10:43,975
911 got a call on a robbery in progress.

628
01:10:44,017 --> 01:10:45,697
We showed up, the owner's neck was broken.

629
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:48,355
Still money in the drawer, though.

630
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,276
A guest says he saw a man and a
boy enter this room last night.

631
01:10:52,318 --> 01:10:53,777
Seems they left here in a hurry.

632
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:56,654
Maybe you can explain
what the hell is going on.

633
01:11:02,994 --> 01:11:04,537
Where are you, Jim?

634
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,861
Look, maybe I should have
said something about the money.

635
01:11:38,405 --> 01:11:40,782
It doesn't matter now, but...

636
01:11:40,824 --> 01:11:42,784
I made a mistake thinking I could help you.

637
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:48,915
We're not going to Chicago?

638
01:12:22,574 --> 01:12:24,117
I'm sorry about Jackson.

639
01:12:25,452 --> 01:12:27,204
He was a great dog.

640
01:12:27,246 --> 01:12:29,456
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

641
01:12:30,457 --> 01:12:34,378
Thanks for helping
give him a proper burial.

642
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:39,466
I hope someday there's
a funeral for my mother.

643
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:15,752
Come on.

644
01:13:20,216 --> 01:13:21,342
Excuse me, sir.

645
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:26,721
I was wondering if you could help...

646
01:13:26,763 --> 01:13:29,183
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord.

647
01:13:30,475 --> 01:13:33,686
May the perpetual light shine upon Rosa.

648
01:13:34,854 --> 01:13:37,399
And may her soul, through the mercy of God,

649
01:13:38,483 --> 01:13:39,859
rest in peace.

650
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:43,280
Amen.

651
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:56,793
Thanks.

652
01:13:57,544 --> 01:13:59,130
It's a lonely experience

653
01:13:59,421 --> 01:14:01,089
to lose someone so close,

654
01:14:02,383 --> 01:14:03,758
especially for a child.

655
01:14:05,427 --> 01:14:07,346
He's your, what? Grandson?

656
01:14:08,389 --> 01:14:10,349
No. I knew his mother.

657
01:14:10,391 --> 01:14:12,642
She asked me to look after him.

658
01:14:13,394 --> 01:14:15,103
That's no small request.

659
01:14:16,313 --> 01:14:18,149
She must have had a lot of faith in you.

660
01:14:33,913 --> 01:14:34,914
Jim?

661
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,458
Yeah, it's me.

662
01:14:36,499 --> 01:14:37,792
Tell me you're safe.

663
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:38,914
- We're okay.
- Is that him?

664
01:14:39,378 --> 01:14:40,545
Find out where he is.

665
01:14:40,587 --> 01:14:42,630
Good. Now tell me exactly where you are.

666
01:14:42,672 --> 01:14:44,192
- I got the sheriff with me.
- Sarah...

667
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:46,319
I got plenty of firepower.
I just need to know...

668
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:47,469
Sarah.

669
01:14:47,802 --> 01:14:51,182
Listen, the kid's not going back.

670
01:14:51,223 --> 01:14:52,849
That's what I'm calling to tell you.

671
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:55,269
I'm doing what his mother asked.

672
01:14:55,311 --> 01:14:57,020
I'm taking him to her family.

673
01:14:58,314 --> 01:15:00,064
That is not up to you.

674
01:15:00,106 --> 01:15:02,901
And what kind of life's he
going to have back in Mexico?

675
01:15:02,942 --> 01:15:05,779
In protection forever,
if he even lasts a week?

676
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,739
He can apply for asylum here.

677
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:09,101
With what happened to his mother,

678
01:15:09,126 --> 01:15:10,545
he'd have a strong case.

679
01:15:10,784 --> 01:15:12,328
Can you guarantee he'll get it?

680
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:14,996
Especially the way things are now?

681
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,043
Tell me what's going on with you here.

682
01:15:21,795 --> 01:15:23,630
Let me help you while I still can.

683
01:15:26,049 --> 01:15:27,259
This kid, he...

684
01:15:27,842 --> 01:15:29,636
He didn't bring any of this on himself.

685
01:15:29,677 --> 01:15:32,055
He just needs someone to give him a chance.

686
01:15:33,556 --> 01:15:35,142
I can't shake the feeling

687
01:15:35,184 --> 01:15:39,146
that your mom is somehow
guiding me through this.

688
01:15:39,604 --> 01:15:41,481
She'd want me to help this kid.

689
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,195
If you do this, there's nothing
more I can do to help you.

690
01:15:47,695 --> 01:15:48,905
I know.

691
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,409
You do what you've got to do.

692
01:15:54,661 --> 01:15:55,912
We're heading to Chicago.

693
01:15:55,954 --> 01:15:58,039
Give me a few hours if you can.

694
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:01,751
See you around, Sarah.

695
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:08,508
So? What'd he say?

696
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:09,592
Where's he headed?

697
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:14,013
I don't know.

698
01:16:18,059 --> 01:16:21,104
{\an8}The killer of a highway
patrol officer yesterday.

699
01:16:21,147 --> 01:16:24,607
{\an8}Officer Jay Conley was
found murdered along Highway 40,

700
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,193
west of Amarillo.

701
01:16:26,235 --> 01:16:27,777
Police say they have little to go on,

702
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,904
and are asking for the public's help.

703
01:16:29,946 --> 01:16:32,615
Anyone who may have
witnessed anything suspicious

704
01:16:32,657 --> 01:16:35,994
is asked to contact the
Texas authorities or the FBI.

705
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:37,495
In other news,

706
01:16:37,537 --> 01:16:39,217
closing arguments are expected to begin...

707
01:16:49,799 --> 01:16:52,093
I guess we'd better buy another map.

708
01:16:55,013 --> 01:16:57,308
Figure out how to get you to Chicago.

709
01:17:24,067 --> 01:17:24,859
Boss.

710
01:17:49,108 --> 01:17:50,194
Hello?

711
01:17:52,321 --> 01:17:53,488
Yeah.

712
01:17:56,574 --> 01:17:57,575
No problem.

713
01:18:10,256 --> 01:18:12,258
Miguel, come here.

714
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:20,473
Want to try?

715
01:18:21,724 --> 01:18:23,101
Look, stand here.

716
01:18:24,436 --> 01:18:25,937
Now, your finger here.

717
01:18:27,897 --> 01:18:28,898
There you go.

718
01:18:30,024 --> 01:18:33,362
Now, line up this with this notch

719
01:18:34,863 --> 01:18:36,489
with that can on the left.

720
01:18:37,324 --> 01:18:38,825
Spread your legs a little.

721
01:18:39,742 --> 01:18:42,537
Now, put your finger on the trigger.

722
01:18:43,663 --> 01:18:45,790
The gun's going to kick back hard,

723
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,542
so brace yourself.

724
01:18:49,211 --> 01:18:52,797
And when you're ready, just squeeze.

725
01:18:54,924 --> 01:18:55,967
Try it again.

726
01:18:56,009 --> 01:18:58,094
Hold it steady, relax your shoulders.

727
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,846
Keep them loose.

728
01:19:00,513 --> 01:19:02,224
Now, take a deep breath,

729
01:19:02,891 --> 01:19:04,351
let half of it out...

730
01:19:05,018 --> 01:19:07,520
And squeeze that trigger.

731
01:19:13,402 --> 01:19:14,736
You're a natural.

732
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:19,699
Press this button here
to remove the magazine.

733
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,702
Pull the slide back to clear it.

734
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:25,997
Now the gun's empty and safe.

735
01:19:36,758 --> 01:19:37,801
You were a soldier?

736
01:19:38,344 --> 01:19:39,552
Yeah. Marine.

737
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:42,389
You fought in a war?

738
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:45,975
You killed other soldiers?

739
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,900
Someday, I will kill those men.

740
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,781
There's absolutely nothing that
feels good about killing another man.

741
01:20:02,492 --> 01:20:05,036
Your mother died to give you
a chance at a better life.

742
01:20:06,788 --> 01:20:07,956
Don't waste it.

743
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,256
This is the spot.

744
01:20:56,338 --> 01:20:58,965
Do you still get sad when
you think about your wife?

745
01:21:01,343 --> 01:21:03,094
I miss that woman every day.

746
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:07,807
Life doesn't always play
out the way you expect.

747
01:21:10,643 --> 01:21:12,604
There are good times ahead for you, Miguel.

748
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:16,107
Your mom's watching over.

749
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:18,526
She'll make sure of that.

750
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:29,246
This belongs to you.

751
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:35,377
I don't want it.

752
01:21:37,003 --> 01:21:38,255
It's cartel's money.

753
01:21:44,594 --> 01:21:49,015
Then I guess we've got no use for this.

754
01:22:39,316 --> 01:22:40,733
You know something?

755
01:22:41,318 --> 01:22:42,735
It's not bad.

756
01:22:48,074 --> 01:22:49,160
Ready?

757
01:23:51,054 --> 01:23:52,181
Where are we going?

758
01:23:53,432 --> 01:23:55,517
Let's take some side roads for a while.

759
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:03,133
Hello.

760
01:24:05,944 --> 01:24:07,321
Exit 209?

761
01:24:08,364 --> 01:24:09,406
You sure?

762
01:24:09,764 --> 01:24:10,724
OK, thank you.

763
01:24:30,034 --> 01:24:32,036
Look! It's him.

764
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:34,664
Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead!

765
01:24:45,984 --> 01:24:47,403
Is that him?

766
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:48,570
Hold on tight.

767
01:25:11,593 --> 01:25:12,802
Shit!

768
01:25:44,251 --> 01:25:45,502
Get out.

769
01:25:55,262 --> 01:25:56,763
We should run. He'll kill us.

770
01:25:57,639 --> 01:25:59,350
Not if I get him first.

771
01:27:00,952 --> 01:27:02,204
Miguel, let's go.

772
01:27:02,246 --> 01:27:03,414
Come on.

773
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,821
Boss, boss.

774
01:27:29,214 --> 01:27:30,590
Where is that bastard?

775
01:27:44,788 --> 01:27:45,789
Come on.

776
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:01,805
Stay down. Here.

777
01:28:04,933 --> 01:28:06,476
If anything happens to me,

778
01:28:06,518 --> 01:28:09,687
you get out of here, and you
run as far away as you can.

779
01:28:09,729 --> 01:28:11,148
Understand?

780
01:29:00,905 --> 01:29:02,408
Miguel, come over here.

781
01:29:05,743 --> 01:29:08,496
I need you to create a distraction.

782
01:29:08,538 --> 01:29:13,042
Count to 30, then fire
two quick shots out there.

783
01:29:13,084 --> 01:29:14,378
It's ready.

784
01:29:16,255 --> 01:29:18,006
Start counting. Now.

785
01:29:43,765 --> 01:29:45,892
10, 11...

786
01:29:50,189 --> 01:29:52,316
14, 15...

787
01:30:12,419 --> 01:30:15,088
28, 29...

788
01:31:20,628 --> 01:31:21,671
Miguel?

789
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:45,404
Marine Corps!

790
01:31:48,072 --> 01:31:49,741
Get in here and let's finish this!

791
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:57,957
Drop your gun!

792
01:32:04,839 --> 01:32:05,882
Drop it!

793
01:32:15,099 --> 01:32:17,560
Let him go, you bastard.

794
01:32:17,852 --> 01:32:20,063
Let him go?

795
01:32:20,104 --> 01:32:21,481
Why?

796
01:32:25,527 --> 01:32:27,445
He's going to make a good soldier one day.

797
01:32:28,988 --> 01:32:30,615
He's going to be trained by the best.

798
01:32:32,075 --> 01:32:33,493
He will never kill for you.

799
01:32:35,162 --> 01:32:36,163
No?

800
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,707
You know, I was...

801
01:32:41,127 --> 01:32:42,710
I was just like him one day.

802
01:32:44,671 --> 01:32:47,590
We all learn to do what
we must do to survive.

803
01:32:48,425 --> 01:32:50,051
Just like you and me, soldier.

804
01:32:50,927 --> 01:32:52,304
We made our choices.

805
01:32:52,346 --> 01:32:53,888
Let him make his.

806
01:32:55,932 --> 01:32:58,435
Do you think I had a choice?

807
01:33:00,895 --> 01:33:02,314
I never had a choice!

808
01:33:04,065 --> 01:33:05,066
Miguel.

809
01:33:09,196 --> 01:33:12,283
Now he's going to kill his first man today.

810
01:33:12,324 --> 01:33:13,783
- Same as...
- Miguel.

811
01:33:13,825 --> 01:33:15,034
Look at me.

812
01:33:59,078 --> 01:34:00,497
Yeah!

813
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,635
Miguel, don't listen to him.

814
01:34:56,303 --> 01:34:57,245
Don't do it.

815
01:34:58,538 --> 01:34:59,456
Kill me.

816
01:34:59,764 --> 01:35:01,433
Give me the gun.

817
01:35:01,474 --> 01:35:02,642
Give me the gun.

818
01:35:03,042 --> 01:35:03,877
Kill me.

819
01:35:20,034 --> 01:35:21,911
Miguel, walk away.

820
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,291
Walk away. Now.

821
01:35:35,134 --> 01:35:36,343
Wait.

822
01:36:38,571 --> 01:36:40,782
Now you have a choice.

823
01:38:37,065 --> 01:38:38,442
This is for you.

824
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,164
Miguel!

825
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:36,845
Miguel!

826
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:31,384
Heaven knows I've seen darkness

827
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:36,000
And I've seen what it can do

828
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:41,019
And heaven knows that I cant stop this

829
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:45,774
Its like a flood is pushing through

830
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:54,866
There's a storm that's on its way

831
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:03,402
And in the end, yes in the end

832
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:06,760
Everybody's gonna pay

833
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:19,432
There will be a retribution

834
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:24,131
Revenge will have its day

835
01:43:24,156 --> 01:43:28,302
And there will be no absolution

836
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:33,321
And all your secrets made
of glass, they will break

837
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:42,831
There's a storm that's on its way

838
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:51,409
And in the end, yes in the end

839
01:43:51,434 --> 01:43:54,722
Everybody's gonna pay

840
01:44:22,715 --> 01:44:27,630
There's a storm that's on its way

841
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:36,328
And in the end, yes in the end

842
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:39,641
Everybody's gonna pay
