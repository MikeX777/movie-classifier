Fire, fire!
- Water! Bring water!

16
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,918
Good day, Petro.
- What do you want from me?

17
00:03:57,047 --> 00:04:01,598
Don´t be so stubborn
and sell the land to me, Petro.

18
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:04,002
No! I won´t sell it!

19
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:08,200
If you don´t sell it,
I´ll have to take it myself.

20
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:12,206
You still owe me money
and I´ll write something off.

21
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:14,716
Don´t be so hard headed!

How much?
- Twenty crowns.

25
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,720
All right, here you are.

26
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:11,241
Look at the man.

27
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,599
Quiet. Wait.
I want to take a photograph of you.

28
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:37,925
Quiet. Stop...
Wait, wait...

29
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:41,005
Never mind.

30
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:45,558
Is there a pub somewhere?
Beer. Bier...

31
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,726
You should´ve built one right here,
if you were smart

32
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:51,839
and knew the ropes...
Goodbye!

33
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,884
What do you want this time?
- Have you made up your mind yet?

34
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:06,159
Will you sell or not?
- No! Never!

35
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:10,883
Don´t be so hasty and think it over.
Happy Shabbat!

36
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:29,600
He doesn´t want to sell but he will.
Happy Shabbat!

37
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,518
Go on.

38
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:09,963
Why do I have to work so hard?
- You have to, Marijka.

39
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,282
That´s why we were born.

40
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:16,166
Hurry up.
Why aren´t you working?

41
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,847
Look at my hands.

42
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:22,084
It´s no good working with you women!
We have a cottage to build!

43
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,404
Hang it!
She doesn´t want to work.

44
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:30,157
You can´t go on like this, Marijka,
or we´ll never finish the cottage.

45
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:34,200
I don´t have time for this,
I have to go to the forest to work.

46
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:37,644
I´d hire someone if had the money.

47
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:41,760
But everyone´s going to the forest.
- If only she were willing to work!

48
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,640
All of us can´t go
and only Danilo will stay here.

49
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,562
It´s no use...

50
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:52,278
Good Lord,
why is our life so hard!

51
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,561
Good day.
- Danilo.

52
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:57,882
Let´s go home.

53
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,440
Praise the Lord.
- Forever and ever.

54
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:04,035
I need a helper.
- To build your cottage?

55
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,839
I could help you out.
- Let´s go.

56
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:09,516
Why don´t you hire me then?
- I could.

57
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:13,036
Let´s talk about it inside.
- Very well.

58
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:16,201
I´ll pay you properly.

59
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,482
And there´s not much work.

60
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:24,807
I need you to work for me
until we float timber.

61
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:31,080
Until then you could work for me
for a reasonable wage.

62
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:35,405
L´ve got enough work of my own
and I don´t want to skin you.

63
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:39,279
I´ll do it for a cheap price.
- That´s settled then.

64
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:44,158
L´m getting married in three weeks
and nothing is ready yet.

65
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:48,119
Let me tell you something.

66
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:53,600
Shabbat is almost over,
so I can tell you now.

67
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:56,799
- What is it?
- L´ve found a nice place for you.

68
00:08:56,887 --> 00:09:02,041
A fine place indeed.
I could build an inn there.

69
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:08,797
The Lord summoned
Princess Sabbath to his throne.

70
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:14,246
I recorded Petro´s debt
on his land in the books.

71
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,803
It is a fine place.

72
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:21,886
Ester and Hershkowitz will have an inn
and a tobacconist´s shop there.

73
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,845
Praise the Lord!

74
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:44,520
Praise the Lord,

75
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,682
Jesus Christ!

76
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:12,122
Brother, don´t let Mother work
on her own at home.

77
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:15,523
Not to worry, brother.
- I know.

78
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:53,527
Come and have a look at my fine goods.
For five crowns only.

79
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:55,718
It´s beautiful!

80
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:08,360
Do you like the scarf?
- It´s very nice.

81
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:42,563
Petro Birchak!

82
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,116
Have you made up your mind?

83
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:50,515
Will you sell?
- I won´t!

84
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,445
Play us a tune, band!

85
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,601
Keron, come here.

86
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:00,964
You´ll dismiss Petro in a week.
- Who?

87
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,885
Petro Birchak.
- Why would I do that?!

88
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:09,718
Do it for me. Dismiss him.

89
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,520
And I´ll write something off
from your debt.

90
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:17,925
He´d kill me if I do that.

91
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:23,201
He won´t kill you.
Do it for me.

92
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:28,242
What´s in it for me?
- I´ll settle with you later.

93
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,085
Very well, I´ll see what I can do.

94
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,877
Let´s get going, fellas!

95
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:40,843
Follow me!
Let´s sing the Red Rose.

96
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:06,679
You´ll be all alone now.
- Olena will be with me.

97
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,478
How are you?

98
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,842
You´re so pretty.

99
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:33,396
May the Lord bless you with good health.

100
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:36,285
How are you?
- Very well.

101
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:39,558
I know, you old fox.

102
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,156
Give me some nuts.

103
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:54,238
How is our young lady?
How about a kiss, huh?

104
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,835
Leave me alone!
- What do you want from her?!

105
00:20:56,967 --> 00:21:00,755
Keep your hands off!
Or do you want to kill me?

106
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,402
You ought to show some respect
to your employer!

107
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:09,355
Don´t be angry at him, Mr. Keron,
he´s still a hot-headed youth.

108
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,762
Shut up! Hush!

109
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:17,800
Is your corn ground?
- Yes, it is. - Very well.

110
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:23,324
Are you still afraid of me?

111
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:29,560
Come on, don´t be afraid...
- Please, don´t...

112
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,565
It´s finely ground.

113
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:36,677
Give it to Khava.
- Take it...

114
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,358
Take it before I buy it...

115
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,160
Have you seen Keron Herzan?
- No.

116
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,845
I don´t believe you!
You´ve paid us less!

117
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,395
Me?
- Show me!

118
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:45,122
I can show you.

119
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,399
You keep ripping us off.

120
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:52,757
Let´s go.
- That´s not true.

121
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,197
Marijka, get some hay.
- Yes.

122
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:41,758
Why aren´t you doing anything!

123
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:46,085
L´m forced to do everything myself.

124
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:53,364
Don´t stare at her like that
and do your work!

125
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:55,045
Go to hell!

126
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:59,325
May the Devil take you!
- Good Lord!

127
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:04,119
A plague on you!

128
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:06,238
And misfortune!

129
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,478
Marijka!

130
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:31,720
Marijka!

131
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:48,721
Adam, you´ll go over there
and Petro will chop the bark off.

132
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:55,722
Why are you giving him such work?
- He´s a lazy and unreliable fellow.

133
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:59,243
I want to get rid of him.

134
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:05,485
Meet me at Rosenthal´s in an hour.

135
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:07,477
Give me a discount, the bacon stinks.

136
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,159
Smell it.
- But you knew about it.

137
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:12,278
You didn´t have to buy it.

138
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:15,439
Cut it out!

139
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:18,479
To hell with you!

140
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:21,326
How are you, Margita?
Where´s Khava?

141
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:23,836
Are you still angry at me?

142
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:25,884
L´ve brought you something.

143
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:28,362
Why can´t you leave me alone?!
- You´re always like that...

144
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:33,403
Go to hell!

145
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:40,161
What do you think of the bacon?

146
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:44,562
Nothing.
- It´s good bacon.

147
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:48,600
If you say so...
- It´s good and cheap.

148
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,596
Do you have some home brew?

149
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:56,003
I have and it´s good and cheap.

150
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:00,997
And strong. Everything I sell is good.
- How much do you want for a litre?

151
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:05,486
A few crowns.
- A few crowns? All right.

152
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:09,800
I may buy more. I´ll leave some money
as an advance.

153
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,518
Very well.

154
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:17,163
I´ll leave the bacon here, too.
Petro Birchak will pick it up.

155
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,243
All right.

156
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:23,404
Khava!

157
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,957
Keron... Keron! Keron!

158
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:32,036
Itska! Keron... Itska!

159
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,078
What do you want?!

160
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:56,525
Here´s some...
- Go to hell!

161
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:59,236
Remember what you have done, Itska!

162
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:05,241
You´ll never see me here again!
- That´s all we needed.

163
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:11,645
You´re such a fool!
Why did you fall out with him?!

164
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:15,082
That´s all we needed!

165
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:22,279
Good day, Rosenthal.
- Good day to you.

166
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:26,798
L´ve come for bacon. Where is it?
- Over there. Take it.

167
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:31,562
Tell him not to bring it
to my house ever again.

168
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:34,321
L´ve got enough troubles of my own.
- L´ve got troubles of my own, too.

169
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:39,683
L´ve got more troubles than you. Go.
- Goodbye.

170
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:47,959
Let´s move out
and leave this place.

171
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:52,003
Let´s leave this place.

172
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,278
Move out.

173
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:11,039
Six...

174
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:13,599
Seven...

175
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:24,685
Here´s bacon for lunch.

176
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:28,763
It stinks.
- What stinks?

177
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,443
Are we supposed to eat it?

178
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,956
This is what Keron buys for us!

179
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:42,277
If we work hard,
we need to be fed properly.

180
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:46,482
It´s Keron´s work! To hell with him!

181
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:50,956
We can´t eat this. Look.

182
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:54,639
Feed it to the Devil! Let´s go!

183
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,602
Look, fellas, if l´m not right...

184
00:31:59,727 --> 00:32:02,321
Let´s find Keron!

185
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:10,443
Keron, your men earn too much.

186
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,518
The price of timber has dropped.

187
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:15,360
We´ll cut their wages by 20 percent.

188
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:18,877
We can´t do that!

189
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:23,479
We must. Some cigarettes, enough to eat,

190
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:26,440
and home brew should fix it.

191
00:32:26,607 --> 00:32:30,600
Only if the men accept it.

192
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:37,396
Give it to them.
- Twenty percent off?

193
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,003
Three percent are for you.

194
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:46,195
I´ll see what I can do.
- Go.

195
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:50,205
And talk to them.
- I will.

196
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:53,564
I´ll count it up.

197
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:58,122
That´s much better now.
- Goodbye.

198
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,965
I bring you money, fellas.

199
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:23,475
You´re going and you too
to make sure that everything goes well.

200
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:26,405
You´ll help them too, Kovacz.

201
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,639
Petro!

202
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:12,004
Petro!

203
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,598
Don´t you hear?

204
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:26,637
You´ll fetch some home brew!

205
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:29,600
We´ve bought tickets to Jaffa, Father.
- What?

206
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:33,158
It´s one of Herzan´s men.

207
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:35,278
Thank God.

208
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,596
He could buy something.

209
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:41,762
May the Lord keep you, Rosenthal.
- Likewise.

210
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:45,482
I need some home brew.
- It´s over there.

211
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:49,236
It´s good and strong. Here.

212
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:52,803
Making good home brew
isn´t easy, is it? - Take it.

213
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,442
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

214
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:18,684
What´s the matter?
- Nothing.

215
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:23,199
Come, let´s have a drink, Petro.
- All right.

216
00:35:56,407 --> 00:36:01,197
It looks like the price of timber
has dropped.

217
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:04,956
They´re cutting our wages by 30 percent.

218
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:07,402
It´s too much for us.

219
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:10,804
I bargained with them
to cut your wages by 20 percent.

220
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:13,487
It´s up to you, fellas.
It makes no difference to me.

221
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:16,440
As long as we get something in turn.

222
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:20,845
It´s better than nothing.
We have to accept it.

223
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,162
We have no choice.
- Very well.

224
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:30,004
Have you heard the news?
- What news?

225
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:32,926
Keron wants to cut our pay.
- Our pay?

226
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:35,204
They can´t do that!

227
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:37,798
We won´t let them do it!

228
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:58,438
Get fire from the neighbour.
- Right away.

229
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:41,715
May the Lord bless you with a young,
pretty, hardworking and pious woman.

230
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:46,477
May the Lord bless you with glory,
new life and keep you.

231
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:51,685
What will she get?
- A fine new inn.

232
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:53,917
Petro Birchak built it.

233
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:58,518
Birchak would be a fool
to build it for you.

234
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:03,397
He won´t give it away for nothing.
- He owes me money.

235
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:05,757
You can see for yourself.
Here´s my book of debts.

236
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:12,235
I have a house, an inn,
and all is good.

237
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:16,838
May you have ten thousand
sheep in your pound

238
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:21,438
and two or three lambs from each ewe.

239
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:31,522
May your wife be happy
and may you lead a happy family life.

240
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:39,481
What will we call our inn?

241
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:43,441
It has to have a name.
- Turistaheim.

242
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:45,603
No.

243
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,359
L´ve got it. Touristhouse.

244
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:33,879
May the Lord keep you.

245
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:38,200
Give me paper and sugar for the eggs.

246
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,563
Here you are.

247
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:54,044
Goodbye.

248
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,359
STATE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

249
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:37,079
Write a letter for me.
- I can write it for you.

250
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:39,402
There´s no need.

251
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:47,958
Dear Petro, Marijka is cheating
on you with Danilo. Olena.

252
00:42:41,807 --> 00:42:44,367
Listen, it´s meal time.
You ought to let them go.

253
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:46,921
Look at what time it is.

254
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:52,718
Break.

255
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:12,803
Is this supposed to be bacon?
And I am to eat it?! Look!

256
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,643
He´s ripping us off! Thief!

257
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,878
We won´t let them cut our wages!

258
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,886
Who is ripping you off? Me?

259
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:33,406
Who bought you the ram?
Who bought you home brew?

260
00:43:33,687 --> 00:43:37,236
L´m not ripping you off, Rosenthal is!
Let´s teach him a lesson!

261
00:43:51,727 --> 00:43:55,720
Run! Pogrom!

262
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:02,604
Talk sensibly, fellow.
Who are the people?

263
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,962
The loggers from the forest.
- I though so!

264
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:12,281
Who is he talking to about it?
- Maybe he doesn´t want to wait.

265
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,718
Is Keron with them?
- He is. - Be careful.

266
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:18,523
Line up!

267
00:44:22,647 --> 00:44:25,923
The rabbi told me:
´´lf you leave, you´ll make God angry. ´´

268
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:31,275
Run, Rosenthal, pogrom.

269
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:33,484
The loggers are coming!

270
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:36,963
Pogrom! Pogrom!

271
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:03,006
Nothing´s the matter,
the men just had too much to drink.

272
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:07,917
Let me take care of it.

273
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:14,603
I´ll put things in order.
By hook or by crook.

274
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:16,877
It´s our right.

275
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:23,763
Let´s go!

276
00:46:24,007 --> 00:46:28,239
Follow me, let´s put things in order.

277
00:48:57,527 --> 00:48:59,563
Petro Birchak!
- That´s me!

278
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,678
L´ve got a letter for you.

279
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:06,197
Where is it from? - From Kolochava.
- Any news?

280
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:09,602
Petro Suhaj!
- That´s me.

281
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:16,080
I´ll read it for you.
- No, thanks.

282
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,162
He´s a strange man.
- Who?

283
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:23,324
Petro, help them carry the log.

284
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:35,762
A 20 percent reduction.

285
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:38,959
How do you expect to achieve it?

286
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:42,363
I managed to cut production
costs by 20 percent.

287
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:43,886
How did you manage that?

288
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:47,397
I reduced the workers´ wages
by a quarter.

289
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:51,239
It wasn´t an easy thing to do.

290
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:54,122
The workers went on strike.

291
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:57,519
And if it weren´t for Keron Herzan...

292
00:49:58,247 --> 00:50:00,602
You´re a true businessman, Hugo.

293
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:04,117
A genuine talent
when it comes to national economy.

294
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:13,635
How dare you come here!
Go to my father.

295
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:23,483
Rosenthal, would you read
this letter for me?

296
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,996
Give it to me, I´ll read it for you.

297
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:36,647
Dear Petro, Marijka is cheating
on you with Danilo. Olena.

298
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,883
Nothing else?
- Nothing.

299
00:50:39,047 --> 00:50:41,083
Give me some home brew.

300
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,757
If you pay for it.

301
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,957
On the slate.
- I can´t.

302
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:48,282
Give it to me on the slate.
- I can´t.

303
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:52,524
What a bargain!

304
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:54,683
What did you read to him, Father?
What was it?

305
00:50:54,807 --> 00:50:58,595
His wife is cheating on him.
He´ll kill her when he comes home.

306
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:01,720
Kill her!
- It happens.

307
00:51:44,087 --> 00:51:46,237
Out of my way!
- What do you want?

308
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:48,562
What are you doing?!

309
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:52,245
It´s Danilo´s oar.

310
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:02,479
What do you want?!

311
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:05,718
What do you want!

312
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:12,324
You´ll get a hundred crowns and leave!

313
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:14,756
You´re fired!

314
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:19,880
Fired or not, the logs are ready.

315
00:52:20,007 --> 00:52:21,486
Danilo will come.

316
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:23,837
Let me go on the raft with him.

317
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:26,765
I´ll settle with fifty crowns.

318
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,285
Very well.

319
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:22,805
They´ve been waiting for you
for quite a while! - L´m coming.

320
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:32,438
What are you doing? Help him out!

321
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:01,560
Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

322
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:05,043
You´ve come just in time,
the logs are ready.

323
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:07,123
I´ll start working right away.

324
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:17,881
Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

325
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,760
How´s Mother?
- She´s well, thank God.

326
00:56:20,887 --> 00:56:23,447
Praise the Lord.
- And what did Marijka say?

327
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:25,364
Nothing.

328
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:29,562
Wait! Wait!

329
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:39,201
You´ve come just in time.

330
00:58:39,327 --> 00:58:42,683
Go now! Hurry up!
Be off!

331
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:24,479
Do you know
what happened to Danilo?

332
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:39,085
What´s the matter with you?
- Nothing.

333
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:14,919
You don´t know
anything, Adam, do you?

334
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:18,835
I know what happened.
- You only think you do.

335
01:02:19,127 --> 01:02:22,164
You´ll never get anything out of them.
One´s like a stranger here.

336
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:25,165
Petro Birchak killed my brother Danilo!

337
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:27,642
In that case, tell me something else.

338
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:30,440
How did you find out?
- I know.

339
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:32,956
I mean whether you have any evidence.

340
01:02:33,127 --> 01:02:36,119
Anything that would prove you right.

341
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:39,398
I don´t, I only know he killed him.

342
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:41,836
You know nothing at all,
no matter what you think.

343
01:02:41,927 --> 01:02:44,680
I can´t prove it before the court
but I...

344
01:02:44,807 --> 01:02:48,197
That´s just it. And where
will you go now? - Home.

345
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,520
Open the door.
I can hardly breathe in here.

346
01:02:52,607 --> 01:02:54,757
It can´t be that bad.

347
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:01,287
You´re drinking too much, dear.

348
01:03:01,407 --> 01:03:05,605
I can´t stand this damned country
any more.

349
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:09,957
Do you know Petr Birchak?
- I see him now and then.

350
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,647
He killed someone today.
- Why?

351
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:15,327
Why? Because he´s an animal.

352
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:17,324
Because this wolf country.

353
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:20,126
Because this country
is still in the middle ages.

354
01:03:20,247 --> 01:03:23,045
It´s horrible.
He´ll end in jail.

355
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:25,522
And who would report him to the police?

356
01:03:25,647 --> 01:03:29,481
Besides, it´s hard to prove.

357
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,998
Maybe it was an accident after all.

358
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:34,163
You always pick the worst,
don´t you?

359
01:03:34,287 --> 01:03:36,721
They eat one another.

360
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:40,806
Animals, Jews, men and their masters...

361
01:03:40,927 --> 01:03:43,043
...and we´ll all end up dead.

362
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:46,477
What blasphemy!
I´d be happy here.

363
01:03:46,607 --> 01:03:48,563
Where are you going?

364
01:03:48,687 --> 01:03:50,518
Never mind.

365
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:56,246
Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

366
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:59,359
Goodbye, my child.

367
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:02,645
You´ll come in a year, Father.
You will see.

368
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:05,202
Let´s go. It´s high time to leave.

369
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:07,522
They´re waiting for us.

370
01:04:11,927 --> 01:04:14,282
Where are they going, Mr. Rosenthal?

371
01:04:14,407 --> 01:04:16,159
To Jaffa.

372
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:21,998
Pour me a glass, Rosenthal.

373
01:04:22,127 --> 01:04:24,766
I don´t have time.
I have to bid them farewell.

374
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:26,923
What for? They are lucky
they can leave

375
01:04:27,047 --> 01:04:30,676
this damned country.
- You´re right.

376
01:04:42,247 --> 01:04:45,922
It such a nice house.
- It costs money.

377
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:49,437
We need an oven.
- Make one yourself then.

378
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:52,880
May the Lord bless you with good health.

379
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:57,759
May the Lord bless you with good health.
- The same to you.

380
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:01,237
What brings you here?
- There´s no help here.

381
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:05,201
This cottage belongs to me.
- Good Lord, how can that be?

382
01:05:05,327 --> 01:05:11,277
How come?
- Your son owes me a lot of money.

383
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:14,121
It´s my house now.

384
01:05:14,247 --> 01:05:18,126
I want to live here
so pack your things and go.

385
01:05:21,727 --> 01:05:24,116
Very nice.

386
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,517
It´s a nice house.

387
01:05:26,647 --> 01:05:28,683
It´s Petro´s cottage.

388
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:29,683
It´s mine now!

389
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:48,165
Good day.

390
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,085
Do you have cigarettes and beer?

391
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:02,680
Our first customer!
- At last.

392
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:09,238
Don´t laugh. It´s a nice sign.

393
01:06:10,207 --> 01:06:13,324
Here´s your beer and cigarettes.
- Open it.

394
01:06:15,807 --> 01:06:17,286
Open it.

395
01:06:20,087 --> 01:06:23,045
A fine business you have. Mazel tov!

396
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:32,643
It was the Czech man who told
us to open our Touristhouse.

397
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:44,486
Pack your things and leave.

398
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:56,562
It serves you right. You can go.

399
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:03,637
He should have left long ago.

400
01:07:07,247 --> 01:07:09,886
Good luck and may the Lord keep you.

401
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:47,117
Petro killed Danilo!

402
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,637
Petro killed Danilo!

403
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:57,761
Petro killed Danilo!

404
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:43,965
Petro owes me more

405
01:08:44,087 --> 01:08:47,636
than his cottage and land are worth.

406
01:09:01,087 --> 01:09:03,999
He´s here! Petro Birchak!

407
01:09:11,607 --> 01:09:14,679
Did you think I wouldn´t come back?

408
01:09:16,047 --> 01:09:19,437
Do you want my cottage?

409
01:09:19,847 --> 01:09:22,486
In that case, you have to pay me.

410
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:29,201
More! More!

411
01:09:31,647 --> 01:09:33,877
More! More!

412
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:39,159
You have to pay me more!

413
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:41,403
My God, you´ll ruin me.

414
01:09:41,527 --> 01:09:42,676
Here´s a thousand crowns.

415
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:47,075
You´ve ruined me.

416
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:49,760
It´s good money.

417
01:09:50,087 --> 01:09:53,318
Take it a leave.

418
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:32,683
Praise the Lord.
- Forever.

419
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,437
Are you hungry?

420
01:11:15,207 --> 01:11:17,596
Do you hear, Marijka?

421
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:31,522
And Petro is building a new cottage.
