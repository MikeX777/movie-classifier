2
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,497
Sleepin' already?

3
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:44,137
Someone must've worn
me out.

4
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,339
That looks good on you.

5
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,608
It's so fancy.

6
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,477
What do you think
we can get for it?

7
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,112
I wanna keep it.

8
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,472
Hey, Marie, stay inside.

9
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,532
Everett?

10
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,802
Did we drink all the beer?

11
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,088
Everett?

12
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,029
Everett.

13
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:40,842
Hello?

14
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,971
Shit, shit, shit.

15
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,072
Hey, hey. We have to
go right now, okay?

16
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,573
Come on.

17
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,741
It found me.

18
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,682
It's inside me.

19
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,054
No!

20
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,136
No!

21
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,807
No!

22
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:19,019
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
this is perfect.

23
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,187
See, this is exactly
the kinda place

24
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:21,856
I was talkin' about, guys.

25
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,724
It's a shame Dennis isn't here.

26
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:24,925
He'd love to see this.

27
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,827
Knowin' the popular
culture behind Bigfoot

28
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,395
is a great way to
learn more about him.

29
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,131
In fact, with any
kind of cryptid-

30
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:33,300
- We just need that
lighter fluid, Oz.

31
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,106
Hello.

32
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,939
Hey, hi. Could you turn
that down for a quick sec?

33
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,143
Hello? Yeah, hey.

34
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,345
Yeah, sorry. I saw you called.

35
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,182
Did you try... Yeah, yeah.

36
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,017
No, did you try the zip file?

37
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,718
Yeah, no problem. Happy to help.

38
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,220
Okay, bye. Bye bye.

39
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,257
Your work know you're going
off the grid this weekend?

40
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,926
Oh, well, Isabelle
said there'd be

41
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,762
service at the cabin, so...

42
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:35,796
Oh.

43
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,697
Shoot.

44
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,835
Well, uh, maybe this
is a good thing, right?

45
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,071
Give my boss a chance to
Google something for a change.

46
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,774
Where is everybody?

47
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,108
Pit stop.

48
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,277
So what class is
this for anyway?

49
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,379
It's called cryptozoology.

50
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:55,015
We study mythical
folklore animals.

51
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:55,883
Wow.

52
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,252
What's your major?

53
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,754
Photojournalism.

54
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:01,455
Oh.

55
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,225
Huh.

56
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,859
We're all just trying
to finish up our masters.

57
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,430
Everyone said this class
was an easy A, so...

58
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,065
Oz in there is our TA.

59
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,800
He'll give you an
earful, if you want it.

60
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,034
Good to know.

61
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,839
So, uh, you and Isabelle, huh?

62
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:19,740
Yeah.

63
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,044
You know, we've only known
each other two months, but,

64
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,145
I don't know.

65
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,982
She's cool, but uh...

66
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,385
A nice guy like you?

67
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,256
Honestly, she'll chew
you up and spit you out.

68
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:40,060
Well, um, I haven't exactly
gotten chewed up yet, so...

69
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:45,766
We're
probably good, right?

70
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,168
Pretty slow today, huh?

71
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,804
Always is in the Dead Month.

72
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:54,308
Every year around this
time, people go missing.

73
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,477
Explains why the
cabin was so cheap.

74
00:12:56,511 --> 00:13:00,080
What do they just get like
lost in the woods or something?

75
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,350
Well, no one knows for
sure what happens, but uh,

76
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:05,553
there is a theory.

77
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,589
- Oh, god.
- Yeah.

78
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:09,923
I thought you told us
that Bigfoot is harmless?

79
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,594
Well, no, he is, he
is. I said it's a theory.

80
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:14,161
It just happens to be a bad one.

81
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,462
Tell you what,
I'll be right back.

82
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,599
Let me try to call Professor
Kasdan again, yeah?

83
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:18,499
Awesome.

84
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,170
Our buddy here
thinks we're gonna

85
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,507
run into Mr. Sasquatch
this weekend.

86
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,408
You ever see anything?

87
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,579
That beast you're lookin' for.

88
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:32,980
It's out there.

89
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:43,190
There's an unspeakable evil
livin' out in those woods there.

90
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:47,961
And you better hope it
doesn't sense your presence,

91
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,598
because if it
knows you're there,

92
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,469
they'll be coming
for ya.

93
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:56,504
Okay, then.

94
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,407
What's the damage?

95
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,275
$52.

96
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,611
75 cents.

97
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:04,512
Yeesh.

98
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,483
Hey, keep the change.

99
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,251
Dead Month and everything.

100
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,554
Safe journeys.

101
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,638
Hey, are you sure
it's okay that I'm here?

102
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:35,342
I didn't realize I'd be the
only non-student tagging along.

103
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,977
Oh, yeah. No, trust me.

104
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,380
Professor Kasdan
is like thrilled

105
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,649
to have another person
forced to listen to him.

106
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,551
Just, you know, relax.

107
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:45,854
Try to have fun.

108
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,160
You didn't wanna
wear your khakis?

109
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,162
Oh!

110
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,498
No, I, I love them.

111
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:02,436
Now?

112
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,575
Yeah, I mean, I got
them for you to wear.

113
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:08,475
Right.

114
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,679
Right, yeah.

115
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:15,683
I mean, I'm not sure they're
exactly meant for hiking.

116
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:20,020
But uh,
I'll give it a shot.

117
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,355
Yeah?

118
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,423
Okay.

119
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,224
- Oh, I have to pee.
- Oh.

120
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,593
Sorry, babe.

121
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,964
You're in for quite
a treat this weekend

122
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:34,001
as we delve into our
new area of study.

123
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,637
In the last 20 years,
there've been over

124
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,272
two dozen sightings in the area.

125
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:42,009
Today is about
exploring the territory!

126
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,311
Finding clues, evidence!

127
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:48,215
And that could be tree markings,
that could be footprints.

128
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,350
That could be feces.

129
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:54,988
Anything that sheds light
on the existence of Bigfoot!

130
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:04,231
Hey.

131
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,735
How did the snowman feel
when he got the flu?

132
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,204
Abominable.

133
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,475
Hey, you know we should probably
catch up with the others.

134
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,243
Oh, yeah. Totally.

135
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,217
My little explorers,
keep your eyes peeled,

136
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,453
and you might wind up
in tomorrow's headlines.

137
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,522
Back in 1811-

138
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,592
- Hey, guys!

139
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,659
I think I'm gonna stick around

140
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,227
and watch this
black-capped Chickadee.

141
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,662
Anyone wanna join?

142
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,466
You know what? We'll just,
we'll wind back around.

143
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,201
Oh, yeah.

144
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,169
Cool beans.

145
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:48,108
Explorers say that
Bigfoot often throws rocks

146
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,477
at trespassers, as a warning.

147
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,048
It's so refreshing
to be with someone

148
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,451
who actually listens for once.

149
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,654
I mean, Chris is literally
the opposite of Dan.

150
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,589
He's such a douche bag.

151
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,124
I mean, you like him, right?

152
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,227
You mean the human
dad joke back there?

153
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:10,798
Maybe that's what I need,
though. Someone uncomplicated.

154
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:11,699
Simple.

155
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,134
Hey, guys.

156
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,435
Let's turn here.

157
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,540
Shouldn't we
stay on the trail?

158
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:22,175
I doubt Bigfoot does trails.

159
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:27,314
Bigfoot doesn't do trails.

160
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:52,574
Hello.

161
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,310
Are you a tourist?

162
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,211
Camera give it away?

163
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,448
What're you lookin' at?

164
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,187
That is a mark
of a goddamn beast.

165
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,424
Bigfoot?

166
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,259
What the fuck else?

167
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,632
Hey, do you mind if
I get a picture of you?

168
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,737
Where are y'all staying?

169
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,638
A cabin.

170
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:26,541
Where at?

171
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,243
The woods.

172
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,150
You know, you
oughta watch yourself.

173
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:40,555
Skinny little girl
off the trail.

174
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:41,455
All alone.

175
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:46,326
It's lookin' like prime
bait, if you ask me.

176
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,429
Especially in Dead Month.

177
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:54,201
Well, hey. This has been
great but I'm gonna head off.

178
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,439
Oh, hey.

179
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:04,411
If you see Squatch,
tell him "hi" from me.

180
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,534
Aw, damn it.

181
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,274
Oh, whatever did this is huge.

182
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:42,550
It's Bigfoot.

183
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,953
What're you
gonna do, taste it?

184
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:48,589
Jeez!

185
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:50,858
Fuck me.

186
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,831
We gotta report this. There
was service near that shop.

187
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,433
Look, let's
just take a second here.

188
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,368
Oz, there's a
fucking dead body.

189
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,004
No, skeleton, all right?

190
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:06,007
It takes eight to twelve
years for a body to decompose.

191
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,009
Great tip. You
should be a doctor.

192
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:09,977
All right, let's go.

193
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:12,880
Guys, guys! There's
no rush to report this.

194
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,281
I mean, whoever this was,

195
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,316
they've been missing
for a very long time.

196
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,317
What's a few more days?

197
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,453
Oz, I know you have a
huge hard-on for Bigfoot

198
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,421
and everything, but we didn't
sign up to fucking obstruct

199
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:22,657
a missing persons case.

200
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,491
Is this ideal? No.

201
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,560
But Dennis and I
have been waiting

202
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,695
all semester for this trip.

203
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,864
I say we stay the weekend.

204
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,834
All right, so, you
prefer to go back

205
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:35,268
and listen to more
lectures instead?

206
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,004
Trust me, I have a lot
to say on this topic,

207
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,973
and without this
hands-on experience,

208
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,908
I'm gonna need twice the
amount of essays from you guys

209
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,711
to make sure you
know your stuff.

210
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:48,482
We report this
the second we leave.

211
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:51,418
The moment the
trip is over, yes.

212
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,922
Okay, yeah. Fine.

213
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:57,491
It probably goes
without saying, but,

214
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,527
we shouldn't mention
this to the others.

215
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,797
Don't wanna stir up
a panic over nothing', right?

216
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,365
And uh, we can't tell Dennis.

217
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,635
Yeah, I mean, god forbid
the loonie professor

218
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,871
with the not-so-secret
alcoholism gets in trouble.

219
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:13,708
I'm serious. The less
he knows, the better.

220
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,362
Hey.

221
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:17,738
Quite the view.

222
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,074
Yeah.

223
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,909
I thought I saw
something in the woods.

224
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:24,377
It could've been a
deer or a moose or-

225
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:25,079
- Or...

226
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:27,715
Something else.

227
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:33,855
I think it's time we head back.

228
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:34,889
All right.

229
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:41,829
So he spit on me,

230
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:44,098
and he was trying to ask me
where we were staying at.

231
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:47,168
- Did you tell him?
- Fuck no, I just left.

232
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:51,471
There's gotta be matches
around here somewhere.

233
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,912
Whoa.
Jake, check this out.

234
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,014
Whoa, buddy. Put that back.

235
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,849
Oh, all right. Okay.

236
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,416
Oh, hey.

237
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,118
Found 'em.

238
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,625
Let's get this fire
started, huh?

239
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:25,806
Oh, man.

240
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,044
You know, it's
really interesting.

241
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,879
Babe, I was just telling you
about this the other day.

242
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:35,516
Do you remember? Do you
remember what I said?

243
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,119
Okay, well, so, correct
me if I'm wrong,

244
00:23:38,152 --> 00:23:42,489
but most people think that
Canadian beer is much stronger

245
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:43,925
than American beer, right?

246
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:47,795
But that's actually false,
so, in Canadia

247
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,831
they use the
alcohol-by-volume method,

248
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:54,936
but in America, we used to use
the alcohol-by-weight method.

249
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:59,040
So, just a cool little
tidbit for you guys.

250
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:01,609
God, I can't do shit
without the internet.

251
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:05,980
Can I have your keys? I
have to make a work call.

252
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:07,949
You hurt her...

253
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:08,649
I swear to god.

254
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:09,850
Oh, babe, I'll come with you.

255
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,552
No, it's okay.

256
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:14,956
It's just a work call, so it's
gonna be like super boring.

257
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,725
So why don't you just stay
and get to know everyone,

258
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:18,826
and I'll back.

259
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,695
- Sorry, babe.
- Yeah, okay.

260
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,664
Coolio.

261
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,636
I'm gonna go shower.

262
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,807
Oh, sure. Get
clean.

263
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:38,045
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the sack.

264
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:45,119
Hey, Professor, are
you not weary that

265
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,755
not one of these guys believe
in anything that we say?

266
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:51,792
As long as we're able to
dismantle people's basic inherent

267
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:56,130
fear of the unknown, even if
it's something as fantastical

268
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,867
as Bigfoot, or any
other cryptid for that matter.

269
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,872
You know, it just means
the world to us, as humans.

270
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:07,541
Hey, cheers to that, right?

271
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:16,617
Hey, um, I know we talked
about this earlier, but,

272
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,054
are you at all worried about
the possibility of, you know,

273
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,789
other sightings?

274
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:24,025
I mean, what if there is
something dangerous out there?

275
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,862
You know, maybe, maybe
a little danger is exactly

276
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:31,632
what's needed for us
to question everything.

277
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:37,204
Enough with all that. So, how's
that thesis of yours goin'?

278
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:40,041
Oh! Oh, hey, it's
comin'.

279
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,575
I hit a little lag last week

280
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,778
because it was my
girlfriend's birthday.

281
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:44,678
Yeah.

282
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,816
Listen, Dennis.

283
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,584
I should let you know that, um,

284
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,053
on our hike earlier, we found-

285
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:54,221
- I, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

286
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:55,122
Excuse me.

287
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,192
Oh.

288
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,060
Okay.

289
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:33,961
- Isabelle.
- Oh, my god.

290
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,796
Professor Kasdan,
you scared me.

291
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,698
I'm so sorry.

292
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:39,967
Listen, uh, do you mind
if I come with you?

293
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,870
'Cause something
unfortunate has come up.

294
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,238
Yeah, what happened?

295
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,341
Well, as it turns out,
it's my wedding anniversary,

296
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:50,711
and no wonder my wife was
short with me before we left.

297
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:52,079
I gotta call her.

298
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:54,281
Yeah.

299
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:57,785
Sure.

300
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,954
Yeah. No, just um, hop in.

301
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:02,656
Thanks.

302
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:06,861
All right.

303
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:08,395
Maybe some reading.

304
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:14,835
Hmm.

305
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,175
What's this?

306
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:29,049
Huh.

307
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:31,819
"Forest Unseen."

308
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:36,657
Wow.

309
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,366
Creepy.

310
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:51,272
"The darkness of
the night brings out

311
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:53,807
the evil that is the wendigo.

312
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,948
But night's end brings the dawn

313
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:03,918
and with the dawn
comes the light."

314
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:38,319
Lilly, I need to go!

315
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:39,954
Give me a minute, man!

316
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:42,022
Come on! I gotta go pee!

317
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:45,159
I swear to god, I'm a
quiet pee'er! Let me in.

318
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:46,327
Jake, you even try,

319
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,828
you'll be walking out
with a concussion.

320
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:50,798
Come on.

321
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,865
Fuck off!

322
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:27,301
Okay.

323
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:46,453
Jake, what did
I tell you, man?

324
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:04,271
Yeah, I know I suppose I
concentrate on my studies

325
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:07,908
a bit too much, but you know,
my wife has absolutely no idea

326
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,910
the concept of budget cuts.

327
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:12,346
I'm the only one supporting us.

328
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,981
Financially, that is.

329
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,294
Have we hit service?

330
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,462
Who is that?

331
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:31,098
Who?

332
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,399
That.

333
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:41,509
So weird.

334
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:46,380
I thought I saw something.

335
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,556
Isabelle.

336
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,090
Are you all right, Isabelle?

337
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,052
Are you all right?

338
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:25,953
Professor?

339
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,528
Oh, shit.

340
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:51,472
Okay, I'm just
gonna pee outside.

341
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:53,508
Yeah, all right.

342
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:58,011
Here we go.

343
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:08,989
What...

344
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:14,562
Yeah.

345
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:18,999
That's why it's here.

346
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,134
Okay.

347
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:31,478
Um...

348
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:35,315
Okay.

349
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,604
Um...

350
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:00,307
Okay?

351
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,419
Oh, my god.

352
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:29,329
Oh! Hey there, tourist.

353
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:33,635
You oughta watch them
showers. They'll get ya.

354
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:37,672
Oh!

355
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:38,573
Hey!

356
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:45,145
Ain't had one of these in years.

357
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:47,615
They'll kill ya.

358
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,895
You ever hear anyone die before?

359
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,466
I have.

360
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:12,840
Every fuckin' night I
still hear those screams.

361
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,545
Yeah, like skin's gettin'
ripped off her bones.

362
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:20,313
You don't forget shit like that.

363
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:23,718
What's that?

364
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,572
If I offended you...

365
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,808
It ain't about that at all!

366
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,843
Look, you already got
your free fucking peep show!

367
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,545
Hey, come on now!

368
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,614
It ain't about
that either, okay?

369
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:56,416
You got your god damn
shirt back on, don't ya?

370
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,852
Hm?

371
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,353
No, you are just my
bait, little lady.

372
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,689
Nothin' personal.

373
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:09,997
It's Bigfoot, he's out
in these woods.

374
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:11,566
Now, you can doubt
him all you want.

375
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,468
He don't give two shits
whether you believe in him.

376
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,771
You can rest assured on that.

377
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:20,007
I can tell you're
not a bad guy.

378
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,810
No.

379
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:24,612
No, you're goin'
for somethin' heavy.

380
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:26,981
I get that, I really do.

381
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:29,016
Whatever you're
planning on doing to me,

382
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,285
things are gonna be bad for you!

383
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:35,355
Your fingerprints are
all over my clothes.

384
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:36,691
Mine are in this truck, I mean,

385
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:40,293
my DNA's on the
fuckin' cigarette!

386
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,597
Yeah, I'mma kill him.

387
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,532
Get that fuckin' rock, too.

388
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:46,601
That's all there is to it.

389
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:47,501
Now.

390
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:51,271
If you die in the
process, well...

391
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:57,410
Shit, so be it. Why don't you
hang onto that DNA for us?

392
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,630
Izzy, where you been?

393
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,071
Izzy?

394
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:26,841
Are you okay?

395
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,778
Hey, you guys seen Dennis?

396
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:34,816
I realized we gotta change
somethin' in the schedule.

397
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,651
Izzy, are you okay?

398
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:38,820
Look at me.

399
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:40,320
Where is my car?

400
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:44,324
I don't remember.

401
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:51,833
Isabelle, dear, what
happened? What's goin' on?

402
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:53,968
- I don't remember.
- Okay, what do you remember?

403
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,403
Just, just calm
down. Just, just...

404
00:38:56,436 --> 00:39:00,074
Isabelle, look at me,
sweetie. Where's Dennis?

405
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:02,610
He's...

406
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:04,679
He's dead.

407
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:11,351
I'm really, I'm really hungry.

408
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:14,889
Jake, where
are the others?

409
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,891
I don't fucking know.

410
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:20,460
Lilly!

411
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:22,563
Chris!

412
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:23,598
Dennis!

413
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:24,932
Hello!

414
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:28,803
- Guys, where are you?
- Why would they answer that?

415
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:37,879
Shit.

416
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,183
Oh, no.

417
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:43,885
Help!

418
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:44,886
Help!

419
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:47,788
Help!

420
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:52,627
One, two, three.

421
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:54,795
Go, go.

422
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,735
Shit.

423
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,769
I saw him.

424
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:03,037
I saw him.

425
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,073
I saw him.

426
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,643
Told you.

427
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:28,062
Guys, this is all my fault.

428
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,462
I knew it was the Dead Month

429
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:30,898
and I still insisted
that we come here.

430
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:33,167
Did you guys bring any
other way of communication?

431
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,669
We actually thought
it'd be a good thing

432
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:36,704
not to have service.

433
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:39,206
Less distractions for everyone.

434
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,075
God, I'm such an idiot!

435
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,944
Okay, okay.

436
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:45,246
Where's the gun?

437
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,814
Oh, I must've dropped it,

438
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,683
while I was getting
dragged through the woods.

439
00:40:48,716 --> 00:40:50,685
All right, all right.
Let's just think, all right?

440
00:40:50,718 --> 00:40:53,621
So, the shop was the last place
that we had service, right?

441
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:56,590
- Now how far was that?
- About an hour's drive.

442
00:40:56,624 --> 00:40:58,960
And if they had such a bad
accident that Isabelle left

443
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:01,228
my car there, then I doubt
it's still fuckin' drivable.

444
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:03,230
Okay, we can walk
until we hit service.

445
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:04,832
What?

446
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:07,168
That's a terrible idea.
That thing almost killed me.

447
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:11,038
Trust me, Chris. If it wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead.

448
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:14,241
- It was trying to warn you.
- Warn me? About what?

449
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:15,843
Spirit of the flesh.

450
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,848
What'd she say?

451
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,083
Wait.

452
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:23,284
Wait, you guys.

453
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:25,019
I found this book.

454
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:28,889
It talks about all kinds of
crazy shit like creatures.

455
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,224
Right.

456
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:31,491
- Bigfoot.
- No.

457
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:33,694
The wendigo.

458
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:38,232
It's this creature that-

459
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:41,268
- Cannibalistic beast
that preys on the selfish.

460
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,170
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know.

461
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:48,142
"The wendigo turns
those overcome with greed

462
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:51,779
into the embodiment
of their weak morals."

463
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,689
That's the spirit.

464
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,991
It's what gets in your head.

465
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:15,036
And that's what you become
once the spirit finds you.

466
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:20,174
He knew.

467
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,178
I brought up the wendigo
sightings to Dennis,

468
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,847
before we even started
planning this trip.

469
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,649
He told me the claims
were phony, but,

470
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,618
he was more worried about
losing his department.

471
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,921
He knew the wendigo was
out there this entire time.

472
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:35,623
God damn it!

473
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:37,191
All right, listen. We need
to get the hell outta here.

474
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,593
- Right now.
- Wait, hold on.

475
00:42:39,627 --> 00:42:42,196
You're telling me that Bigfoot

476
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,665
isn't the only
monster out there?

477
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:46,834
Yes, and it's pure evil.

478
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,670
The torment it inflicts
on those its chooses

479
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:54,275
is beyond anything you can
imagine, and if it finds us...

480
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:58,612
We're better off dead.

481
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:08,557
Isabelle?

482
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:16,030
It knows we're here.

483
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:22,636
They're coming.

484
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,274
Tree.

485
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,611
Turn around.

486
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:33,380
Now...

487
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,383
I'mma tell
you somethin'.

488
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:38,853
Get the fuck off me.

489
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:42,289
Now, I don't want it to be
all bad blood between us, okay?

490
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:44,325
This isn't my intention.

491
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:50,831
I'm Everett Dylan Grunn and
I'm sorry what's happened here.

492
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:52,900
Ow!

493
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,034
You stupid bitch.

494
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:55,102
- Get back here!
- No!

495
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,270
- Come back here!
- No!

496
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,304
God!

497
00:43:57,338 --> 00:43:58,706
- That's it.
- Fuck you!

498
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,407
Get against the
tree. You stay still!

499
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:01,742
Stay still!

500
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:03,711
Give me your fuckin' hands.

501
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:04,879
Jesus, here I was thinking

502
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:08,048
I was only fighting
a Squatch tonight.

503
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,117
Now...

504
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,156
You keep
up that squealin',

505
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:18,792
and that Bigfoot will be
here before you know it.

506
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:27,468
God damn.

507
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,171
Fuckin' psycho
asshole motherfucker!

508
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:31,071
Woo-oo!

509
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,340
Let me hide first.

510
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:49,390
Help!

511
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,148
I couldn't
find any results for,

512
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:25,853
"Kill and consume the blood
and flesh of the others."

513
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:03,083
♪ Fast as you can ♪

514
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:06,987

00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,623

518
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:20,934
That's one stubborn bitch.

519
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:37,130
All right, all right, maybe
Lilly found the crashed car

520
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:38,866
and walked into town for help.

521
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,536
And walks 60 miles into town?

522
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:47,140
Maybe a driver picked
her up or, or maybe...

523
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:53,246
Isabelle?

524
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,315
Jake!

525
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:29,416
Oz.

526
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:35,455
I don't know what's
happening.

527
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:36,223
Oh, shit.

528
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,796
Okay, okay, just stay right
there. Please just don't move.

529
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:49,504
Isabelle, I'm serious,
please! Just stay right there.

530
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:50,605
Don't move!

531
00:52:56,711 --> 00:52:57,779
Please, please, please
don't make me do this.

532
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:59,681
Please don't make me do
this. Don't make me do this!

533
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:00,782
- Oh, god!
- No! No, please don't!

534
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:03,450
No, please don't!
Please don't hurt me.

535
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:07,320
Please don't hurt me.

536
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:08,523
- Come on.
- Please don't hurt-

537
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:10,390
- No, no, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

538
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:11,859
No, no. Shh, shh, shh.

539
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:14,361
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

540
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:16,964
We can fix this, I can fix this.

541
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:18,966
We're gonna figure it out.

542
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,500
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

543
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:22,870
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

544
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:25,773
I'm gonna go find Chris
and, and we'll fix it.

545
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:28,408
We'll get something
together, okay? Just, just...

546
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:34,882
I'm so hungry.

547
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,527
Hello?

548
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:19,894
We need to go, now.

549
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:45,887
What the fuck?

550
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:51,692
Hi, Jake.

551
00:54:55,863 --> 00:54:57,632
I can't find Isabelle.

552
00:54:57,665 --> 00:55:01,068
The other ones are coming,
alright? We are going.

553
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:01,969
Jesus.

554
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:04,238
You know what?

555
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:05,840
I just got here and
it seems like I care

556
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:07,340
so much more about the
others than you do.

557
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:08,743
You don't give a shit
if they live or die.

558
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:10,410
Dude, they would do
the same exact thing.

559
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:11,612
Isabelle wouldn't.

560
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,948
Chris, we don't
have time for this.

561
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,751
Look, you can think I'm
an asshole all you want,

562
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:18,886
but the truth is, I
live in fuckin' reality.

563
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,822
Look, it's great
you got this whole puppy dog

564
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:23,558
thing going on, really,
it's seriously endearing,

565
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:25,458
but you're a fuckin'
pushover, Chris.

566
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:28,495
You sacrificing
yourself here doesn't change that

567
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,531
it just makes you a dumb ass.

568
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:33,100
Let me check the
rest of the house.

569
00:55:33,134 --> 00:55:34,001
Please.

570
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:41,008
Five more minutes.

571
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:45,046
Then I'm gone, whether
you come or not.

572
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:46,681
You're right.

573
00:55:46,714 --> 00:55:49,050
I do think you're an asshole.

574
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,654
God damn it.

575
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:29,790
Hi, babe.

576
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:56,884
Fuck.

577
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:01,989
Lilly?

578
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:08,195
They're inside.

579
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,583
Now are you ready to leave?

580
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:55,062
Run!

581
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:38,832
Let's go.

582
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,203
So here's the plan.

583
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:44,738
We find the creeper that
kidnapped me, grab his keys,

584
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:48,209
get to his car and get
the fuck outta here.

585
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:52,880
What the fuck are these things?

586
01:01:52,913 --> 01:01:53,981
I don't know.

587
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,382
I don't know, it's whatever's
happening to Isabelle.

588
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:57,017
What's happening to Isabelle?

589
01:01:57,051 --> 01:02:00,955
I'm not sure, I think
it's called a wendigo.

590
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,059
Hey.

591
01:02:05,092 --> 01:02:06,193
What?

592
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:08,495
Thanks for not leaving me.

593
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:16,971
Do you hear that?

594
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:18,172
What?

595
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:22,343
Lilly?

596
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:23,444
Where
the fuck are they?

597
01:02:23,477 --> 01:02:26,013
- Lilly, we have to go.
- Not until I find the keys.

598
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:28,082
Lilly, right now.

599
01:02:28,115 --> 01:02:28,983
Got 'em.

600
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:34,788
Come on.

601
01:02:36,223 --> 01:02:37,091
Come on.

602
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:09,584
What the...

603
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:18,392
Lilly! Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

604
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:22,396
Look at me. It's okay.

605
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:27,501
Hey, Lilly? It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

606
01:04:27,535 --> 01:04:29,269
Lilly, stay with me. Come on.

607
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:31,271
Baby, please. Please.

608
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:32,507
Please, please.

609
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:35,142
Lilly. Lilly, Lilly.

610
01:04:37,077 --> 01:04:37,945
Lilly?

611
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,194
Oh, shit.

612
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:04,512
Come on, come on, come on, come
on. Just do it, just drive.

613
01:09:04,545 --> 01:09:06,648
Just drive, please. Come on.

614
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:08,348
They would do the
same exact thing.

615
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:10,450
- Isabelle wouldn't.
- Sorry, babe.

616
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:11,653
Sorry, babe.

617
01:09:11,686 --> 01:09:14,622
You're a fuckin'
pushover, Chris.

618
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:19,694
Hi, babe.

619
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:03,571
I feel like you're
pushing you away, Chris.

620
01:10:03,604 --> 01:10:05,405
No, please. Please.

621
01:10:23,057 --> 01:10:23,925
Shit.

622
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:46,881
Oh, shit. Fuck, fuck!

623
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:52,285
Oh, Jesus.

624
01:10:55,355 --> 01:10:57,525
I hate your fucking khakis.

625
01:11:06,466 --> 01:11:07,334
Fuck.

626
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:47,168
Jesus Christ.

627
01:13:01,481 --> 01:13:02,149

It don't matter anymore.

637
01:13:56,637 --> 01:14:00,574

01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:22,096

to myself about that.

642
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:23,965

A test.

This spirit of flesh.

648
01:14:43,017 --> 01:14:43,884
Wendigo.

649
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:49,590
That wendigo, he knows
me inside and out.

650
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:51,158
He got into my head,

651
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:54,562
and squeezed his way in there.

652
01:14:54,595 --> 01:14:56,496
He made me do things...

653
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:01,535
I ain't proud of.

654
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:08,142
That don't matter none now.
