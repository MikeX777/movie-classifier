1
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,567
- How did I not see that?

2
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,090
- Hey, I'm not here to protect your drink.

3
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,710
While you were gone,

4
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,853
this guy drank it.

5
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,753
- Gimme another.

6
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,877
- I'm sorry, mister,

7
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:03,240
I thought it was free drink.

8
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,490
- Nothing's free anymore.

9
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,383
- I will pay.

10
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,883
I have no money.
- Forget it.

11
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,910
- But I would like to buy you drink.

12
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,190
- I'll buy you one.

13
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,713
What are you having?

14
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,494
- Tequila.

15
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:30,740
- Can we get a shot of Titanium, please?

16
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,220
- Thank you, mister, uh-
- Monroe.

17
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:53,863
- Monroe.

18
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,803
Would you like to see my friends?

19
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,010
- No time, gotta meet someone.

20
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,960
- I will make fast.

21
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,660
- How long you had those guys?

22
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,820
- This one is not guy.

23
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,770
This one is girl.

24
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,333
His girl.

25
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,370
Usually, Putin waits
until Gorbachev is eating.

26
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,890
And then when his back is turned,

27
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,993
he has his way with Ana.

28
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,573
Maybe you can see when you have more time.

29
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,143
Would you like to kiss Ana?

30
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
- No thanks.

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,940
- Make sure you take your
friends with you when you leave.

32
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,773
- Da, Yelena.

33
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,100
I like you, Mr. Monroe.

34
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,403
One more before you go.

35
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,750
- Think I need to take a leak.

36
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,290
Think I'll take it outside.

37
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,268
Thought that you said bye to me.

38
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:44,811
- Next train arriving at Midtown Station

39
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,144
in four minutes.

40
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:56,306
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] 4-1-1-2, standby.

41
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,480
Good evening, Harry.

42
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,473
You have six priority messages
from Chief Inspector Carter.

43
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,572
- Call Carter.

44
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,640
- Harrison?
- Yeah.

45
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,190
- Where have you been?

46
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,600
- Off the grid.

47
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,100
Call it a vacation.

48
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,227
- Next time you go on vacation,

49
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:29,640
do me a favor and let me know.

50
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,350
- Not my job to anymore.

51
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,150
Besides-
- Monroe was hit.

52
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,433
- How bad?

53
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,643
Carter?

54
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,153
- He didn't make it.

55
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,630
Taft wants to meet.

56
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:50,308
- When?

57
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:56,286
- I'll forward you the location and time.

58
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,090
- Monroe's data scan,

59
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,730
came back with traces of Dropa DNA.

60
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,040
- So what brought it out?

61
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,030
- Oh what the hell
are you asking me for?

62
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,373
I mean, survival instincts, I guess.

63
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,670
They're damn flesh pods, Harry.

64
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,670
Who the hell knows why
they do what they do?

65
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,969
- You got a tracker on this Dropa?

66
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,963
- Not yet.

67
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,460
- So what do you need from me?

68
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,610
- Well...

69
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,473
Monroe had this on him.

70
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,730
It's a cell number, untraceable.

71
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,960
So, I want you to go back to the Dry Dock.

72
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,733
Bartender may know something.

73
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,540
Poke around, ask some questions, dig.

74
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,790
It's what you're good at.

75
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,813
That's your gift.

76
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,783
- So...

77
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,813
I'm your tracker?

78
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,990
I'm not even sure I
have that gift anymore.

79
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,340
- If that thing can find Monroe,

80
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,717
it can sure as hell find any one of us.

81
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:15,030
And you better pray it's working alone,

82
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,703
otherwise we are all
in for a world of hurt.

83
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,320
Now, there is one more thing.

84
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,783
I want you to go see Dr. Glenka
at the Leeland Institute.

85
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,903
- A psych test?
- Yeah.

86
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,290
Well, I gotta know if
my dog can still hunt.

87
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,003
You're no good to me otherwise.

88
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,325
- Let us move past the war.

89
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,150
We are going to need to
start the sequence again

90
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,490
if you don't focus.

91
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,503
Please, concentrate.

92
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,960
- Give me a second.

93
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,010
- Your childhood again?

94
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,843
- Yeah.

95
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:20,646
- Was this a good day?

96
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,437
- It was a day.

97
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:26,523
- How are you feeling in that moment?

98
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,272
- Safe, maybe.

99
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:32,313
Protected.

100
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,973
- Come on, stay with the machine.

101
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,760
You were born into a military family, no?

102
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,413
- You already know this.

103
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,570
- Why are you going back to her?

104
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,787
Focus.

105
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,266
- I'm tired of this.

106
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,606
- We are almost done.

107
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:08,606
- We're done.

108
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,613
Well?

109
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,263
- Solid nerves.

110
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,963
- No rust?

111
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,690
- Not exactly.

112
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,250
Your motivation rate is lower

113
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,316
than in your previous tests.

114
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,283
- Well,

115
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,330
it has been eight years
since my last test.

116
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,160
So what does that mean?

117
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,553
- Your mind kept wandering
and that bothers me.

118
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,010
- Uh-huh.

119
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,630
- Considering the nature of your visit,

120
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,873
it could be....

121
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,613
- What?

122
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,293
- Unhealthy.

123
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,183
Today is your birthday.

124
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:05,543
You haven't put in to leave?
- Nope.

125
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,470
- You're going to be over the age limit.

126
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,650
- Look, I could make an
infinite list of complaints

127
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,003
about living in this city,

128
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,160
on this planet too,

129
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,773
but I'd still much rather
be here than up there.

130
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,560
- Are you so sure about that?

131
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,090
- Why didn't you go?

132
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,967
- My husband was too weak for the trip.

133
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,663
He's a virus survivor.

134
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,573
- But if you could?

135
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,210
- The Moon Colony, no.

136
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,413
My job is down here.

137
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,643
Mr. Harrison,

138
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,493
when this is done,

139
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,013
whatever it is,

140
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,700
my advice is for you to leave the city.

141
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,410
- I need employment profile verification

142
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,963
for bartenders at the Dry Dock Bar.

143
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,670

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,650
Three are bartenders,

146
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,390
- How many female bartenders?

147
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,040
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Two.
- Process.

148
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,600
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Based on
the crime scene report,

149
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,610
we are looking for Helen Adamov,

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,740

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,440
Employed nine months and four days.

153
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,420
- I need her education
and employment history,

154
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,820
her cell records for the last 48 hours,

155
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,963
and RFID log.

156
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,040
Well?

157
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,230
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Interesting.
- What?

158
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,440
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Classified
clearance level A12 required.

159
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,780
No additional data available.

160
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,177
Attempting to access.

161
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:50,483
- Hold up, bro.

162
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:55,483
Yeah, you're good.

163
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:26,520
- I'm looking for the bartender
who worked last night.

164
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,117
- Yelena?
- Helen Adamov.

165
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,897
- What?

166
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:36,963
- Helen, Yelena.

167
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,463
- Where is she?

168
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:46,213
- Is she in some kind of trouble?

169
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,166
In dressing room four.

170
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:21,180
- I'd like to have a word with you.

171
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,343
- That's more than a word, genius.

172
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,880
- I'm looking for someone.

173
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,180
He knows a friend of mine.

174
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,923
- Go on.

175
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,320
- He was here last night.

176
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,323
Big Russian guy.

177
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,353
- Hmm, I know a lot of big Russian guys.

178
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,243
- Well, how many were here last night?

179
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,583
- None that I remember.

180
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,223
I think it's time for you to go.

181
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:12,663
Unless you can think of
another reason to stick around.

182
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,081
Hmm, pretty.

183
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,843
Goodbye, mister-
- Harrison.

184
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,433
Your name's Helen Adamov.

185
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,140
Born to Russian immigrant
parents Yuri and Kira Kosov.

186
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,380
Both killed in a train
wreck outside Boston.

187
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,860
Your father's sister,
Dasha Adamov, raised you.

188
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,210
She was assistant

189
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,703
to the Minister of
Socialist American Affairs.

190
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,680
At age fifteen,

191
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,470
you were enrolled in the
Military Intelligence Academy,

192
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,883
and excelled academically.

193
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,920
Eight years later,

194
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,833
you were part of the Moon
Colony's Project Horizon Two.

195
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,270
Then, nine months ago,

196
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,783
you became a bartender in
a dive in the East Sector.

197
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,140
Should I keep going?

198
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,420
- If you know me the way you claim,

199
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,793
then you know it's best to leave me alone.

200
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,440
- October 7th, you left
the city for two weeks,

201
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,613
just disappeared.

202
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,640
There's no record of your transport pass

203
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,073
or RFID being scanned anywhere.

204
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,293
How is that possible?

205
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,450
You know what happened here last night,

206
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,740
so one more time,

207
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,427
where is this man?

208
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:39,240
I need to find him.

209
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,680
- Who are you?

210
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,990
- I'm the guy that's gonna
find the Dropa flesh bag

211
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,895
that killed my friend.

212
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:46,500
- The Dropas are dead,

213
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,933
just like your friend.

214
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,617
- It's a simple question.

215
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:55,774
- Things aren't always what they seem.

216
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,634
- I need to find him.

217
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:00,058
- Who are you?

218
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:02,340
- I'm the guy that's
gonna find the Dropa flesh bag

219
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,225
that killed my friend.

220
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,880
- The Dropas are dead,

221
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,867
just like your friend.

222
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,306
- It's a simple question.

223
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,701
- Things aren't always what they seem.

224
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,060
Did your research happen to mention

225
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,553
that I've had four years
of combat training?

226
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,203
- Eleven years of real combat.

227
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,650
I've killed for a lot less reason.

228
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,213
- This is bigger than us, Mr. Harrison.

229
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,090
Your friend was a part of The Legion.

230
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,433
And my guess is, you were too.

231
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,020
Murders stack up down here
and no one investigates,

232
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,180
unless it was someone that mattered.

233
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,030
How could any of you expect to
walk away from what you did?

234
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,100
- Their cocoons carried the virus spores

235
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,270
that nearly wiped us out.

236
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,250
The only thing that stopped them,

237
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,960
was The Legion.
- Mr. Harrison,

238
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,180
do you know what it's
like to lose everything,

239
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,400
your home, the people you love?

240
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,493
- I don't care about your moral cause.

241
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,340
Where is it?

242
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,780
- I don't know.

243
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,940
- This is not a negotiation.

244
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,860
If you can't help me,
I have other options.

245
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,693
You don't.

246
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,480
- He has a room at the Grand
Hotel in the Lower Quarter.

247
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,980
- I know the place.

248
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,860
- Room 832, name's Mikhail.

249
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,903
No last name, just Mikhail.

250
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,190
- Why did you go there?

251
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,260
- He asked me to contact Mr.
Monroe to leave him a message.

252
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,093
- What message?

253
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,053
- A note with a number.

254
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,373
I left it at his apartment.

255
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,670
- What did the note say?

256
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,653
- There's a traitor in The Legion.

257
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,563
- A traitor?

258
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,743
More!
- That's it I swear.

259
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,093
My father fought for the Dropa's
rights when they came here.

260
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,260
Then The Party killed him for it.

261
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,163
My mother too.

262
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,210
He would tell me that
people were so afraid

263
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,290
that the world was going to end

264
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,543
that they were actually
hoping that it would.

265
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,970
You know, it's easier to
give up, to live in fear.

266
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,000
That's what those in
control want you to feel,

267
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,153
powerless, insignificant.

268
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,580
But the Dropas came here
and they made us realize

269
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,370
that there's more out
there in the universe.

270
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,363
They gave us hope.

271
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,323
What do you believe in?

272
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:12,330
- If the hotel doesn't
check out I'm coming back.

273
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,802
And trust me, you don't
want me to come back.

274
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:16,920
- You won't be back.

275
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,520
Mikhail just may find you
first if he hasn't already.

276
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,380
- That would make my job easier.

277
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,553
- Was it easy before?

278
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,123
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Welcome home, Harry.

279
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,740
Daily status, one missed VidFon call,

280
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,560
eleven unread email transmissions.

281
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,250
Fusion energy bill, 19 days past due.

282
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,793
- Enough already, C.O.N.T.A.G.

283
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:18,293
Can I just have a few minutes?

284
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,293
Alone?

285
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,590
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Harry, I
have something else to say.

286
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,697
- What?

287
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:33,427
- Happy Birthday.

288
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:07,667
- Happy Birthday, baby.

289
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:20,205
- Make a wish.

290
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:34,002
- I make it every day.

291
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,413
- Sometime between 10 and 12.

292
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,280
- DNA sweep?

293
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,950
- Clean.
- Clean?

294
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,100
- Nothing, only established samples.

295
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,990
We're scanning the staff and patrons again

296
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,040
to make sure we didn't overlook anything.

297
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:43,113
- This is professional.

298
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,957
- Does this remind you of something?

299
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:06,101
- Inspector Carter.

300
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,393
- You wanna tell me what
happened last night?

301
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,933
The woman you questioned
last night is dead.

302
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,573
Her eye sockets were crushed in.

303
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,133
I've seen a few Dropas you
finished off look the same way.

304
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,170
- She was breathing when I left.

305
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,540
- Can you explain this?

306
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:26,399
Well?

307
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,090
- She must have removed it
when I was questioning her.

308
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,923
- And?

309
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,930
- She was trying to
manipulate the situation.

310
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,353
She was very, persuasive.

311
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,450
- I've got eyewitnesses
that put you at the Dry Dock

312
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,313
at the same time as the murder.

313
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,960
- What are you implying?
- Implying?

314
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,923
Nothing, except that I
just covered your ass.

315
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,120
Taft can't end up with a trail of bodies,

316
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,590
leading back to this Dropa.

317
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,903
- Yeah, that wouldn't
look good, now would it?

318
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,470
- We're on our own out here.

319
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,263
It's about survival now, ours!

320
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,630
We let these Dropas walk away.

321
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,550
Now they're back to finish us.

322
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,550
- Can you blame 'em?

323
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,600
- I've done some pretty
bad things, Harrison,

324
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,723
things that I can't take back.

325
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,693
- You did them to protect the cause,

326
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,910
like all of us.

327
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,440
- That's The Party's line.

328
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,810
We did it because we had no other choice.

329
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,210
You do what you're ordered to do

330
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,730
and don't ask questions.

331
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,803
- You chose the lesser of two evils.

332
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,500
Just learn to live with it.

333
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,333
I did.

334
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,820
- You're no saint in all of this.

335
00:31:59,066 --> 00:31:59,899
- I know.

336
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,870
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Warning,

337
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,570
two rounds of plasma ammunition loaded.

338
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,858
Restricted use due to potential
thermal burns to civilians.

339
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:07,999
- Coming, I'm coming.

340
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,887
What do you want?

341
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:18,150
- Come on, Jin, play nice.

342
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,040
- I'll play nice up your fucking asshole!

343
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,423
You wrecked my place pretty bad last time.

344
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:22,737
- It was a long time ago.

345
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:24,632
- Come on, get out!

346
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,512
What gives you the right to barge in huh?

347
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,616
Just like that?

348
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:36,510
Geez.

349
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,243
You have no respect for
other people's property!

350
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,183
- You're my eyes down here, Jin.

351
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,040
You always have been.

352
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,950
The Legion needs your help.

353
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,784
- The Legion no more.

354
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:54,060
Those days are gone.

355
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,060
Uh, I don't owe Legion
for nothing, no more.

356
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,110
- Well, consider it a favor then.

357
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,280
- No, your kind of favor,

358
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,230
bad news, bad news.

359
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,690
- I'm looking for the tenant in room 832.

360
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,740
- Don't know nothing.

361
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,140
What number?

362
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,632
- 832.

363
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,503
- Hm, nobody lives there.

364
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
- Catch your breath.

365
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,970
I just need a minute of your time.

366
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,733
- No, no minute for you.

367
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,783
- Make time.

368
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,822
- Ah, now I remember.

369
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:12,070
A big man, a big man, name Mikhail.

370
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,920
What do you want with him?

371
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,330
- It's personal.

372
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,163
Gimme the key.

373
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,870
- Personal?

374
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,460
Everything's personal with you,

375
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,593
means big trouble.
- The key, Jin!

376
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:30,780
- Are you gonna bust
up my place again, huh?

377
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,280
Listen, he's a good tenant, model tenant.

378
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,480
Always pays the rent.

379
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,940
- Your model tenant is a Dropa.

380
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,773
- What?

381
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,200
- And I'm taking him out of
here with or without the key.

382
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,330
You understand?

383
00:38:57,614 --> 00:39:00,869
- I believe you have something
that does not belong to you.

384
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,446
- Come and get it.

385
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,620
- You know a little known fact,

386
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,480
can become a well known fact.

387
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,550
And part of our job, Harry,

388
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,103
is to make sure that don't happen.

389
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:14,040
Now, how in the hell are we gonna do that

390
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,620
if you start trying to blow away Dropas

391
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,203
in front of a damn audience
in the Lower Quarter?

392
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:21,026
Well?

393
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,160
- Got something for ya.

394
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,580
Found that in the Russian's
room at the Grand Hotel.

395
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,900
- Now, why in the hell are you showing me

396
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,733
half a damn cockroach?

397
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,603
This is cybernetic.

398
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,460
That's pretty advanced
technology for a Dropa.

399
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,630
Kinda like them bug bots we
used to use back in the day.

400
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,954
- Yeah, I thought it might
be a surveillance tool

401
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:07,803
or a weapon but it's not.

402
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,440
Took me a moment to figure it out.

403
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,690
- Figure what out?

404
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,930
- It's a decoy, an elaborate decoy,

405
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,430
but decoy nonetheless.

406
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,083
- I'm not following this.

407
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,770
- The Dropas have a
different magnetic makeup

408
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,750
than anything else on this planet.

409
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,160
The magnetic field around them,

410
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,153
throws the compass cells in roaches crazy.

411
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:31,980
- All right, all right,
professor, please, plain English.

412
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,200
- They spin around, get lost.

413
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,140
350 million years of
navigating gone haywire.

414
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,750
Monroe knew this.

415
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,493
He tracked with bugs.

416
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,943
- Okay, so why cybernetic?

417
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,889
- Somehow this Dropa figured this out.

418
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:50,373
He knew Monroe's methods.

419
00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:53,820
He found a way to throw
him off long enough

420
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,740
to let his guard down.

421
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,003
- So, this Dropa is hunting us?

422
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,613
- Monroe anyway.

423
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:05,433
And maybe all of us.

424
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,239
There's one other thing.

425
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,043
The Adamov girl,

426
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,313
said something odd to me last night.

427
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,230
She said the Russian had
a message for Monroe.

428
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,063
- Yeah?

429
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,040
- Said there was a
traitor among The Legion.

430
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,180
Any idea what it's talking about?

431
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,110
- Look, why don't you go home,

432
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,550
get some rest,

433
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,723
take some aspirin.

434
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,393
Hell, take a whole lotta aspirin.

435
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,779
This Dropa knows we're onto it.

436
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,050
- [Madison] Give up that easily?

437
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,533
You've become soft in your retirement.

438
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,690
- What are you doing here?

439
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,163
It's been five years, Madison.

440
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,070
- I came back because someone
killed a member of our team.

441
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,270
Judging by the looks
of you, I'm glad I did.

442
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,643
What happened?

443
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,843
- Retribution.

444
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:06,883
- You look terrible.

445
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,240
- I thought you might have left.

446
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,158
- Someone's gotta keep an eye on you.

447
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:28,623
- I'm fine.

448
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,268
- What's the next move?

449
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,180
- Heading out to the
country in the morning.

450
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,420
- What's out there?

451
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,833
- Hopefully answers.

452
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:46,960
Wanna come along?

453
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,790
You could stay the night.

454
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,133
No strings.

455
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,180
- There never were with you.

456
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,830
- So tell me what you've been
up to the last five years.

457
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,850
- I'm gonna go.
- Look, I...

458
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,093
I just wanna talk.

459
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:12,623
I could really use that right now.

460
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:19,451
- You better dry off first.

461
00:48:43,823 --> 00:48:47,942
- Eva?

462
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,027
I wonder where she could be?

463
00:49:02,157 --> 00:49:05,673
Oh, I must have spent too
long at the shipyards.

464
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:11,080
My beautiful little
girl must have grown up

465
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,536
and moved away.

466
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,473
What am I going to do?

467
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,690
If only she had come to say goodbye.

468
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,523
I miss her so much.

469
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,626
Oh!

470
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,451
You are hiding the whole time.

471
00:49:55,451 --> 00:50:00,051
I knew it.

472
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,203
- So, what happened?

473
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:39,709
- Well,

474
00:50:40,694 --> 00:50:43,743
after The Party disbanded The Legion,

475
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,683
what else was there?

476
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,479
You know we were nothing more
than an embarrassing secret

477
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,693
that just needed to go away.

478
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,283
Taft, Carter, Monroe stayed.

479
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,963
I was out, moving on and you were a wreck.

480
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,030
Guess if I was living in
your skin at the same time

481
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:12,303
I'd be the same way.

482
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,623
Arthur took off to the colony.

483
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,853
It was his time and he wanted
to leave everything behind.

484
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,840
- So what happened to Jackson out there?

485
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,913
- I guess she just
couldn't handle it anymore.

486
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,003
I don't know.

487
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,433
She was on cleanup with me.

488
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,872
It was either us or them
with the Dropa Resistance.

489
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,323
We understood that but the families,

490
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,203
that was different.

491
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,000
A few months later,

492
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,260
Monroe brought in Jackson

493
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,933
to head up the final sweep
of the containment camps.

494
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,460
The Party wanted it finished,

495
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,233
fast and clean.

496
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,693
They poisoned the Dropa water
supply with a DDT derivative.

497
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,803
It only killed the children.

498
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,670
Two months later, I...

499
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,453
I found her dead in a
motel room outside of Waco,

500
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,363
gun still in her mouth.

501
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,760
- Jackson may have been the only one of us

502
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,843
with a conscience.

503
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,073
- Yeah.

504
00:53:50,538 --> 00:53:52,023
And look where that got her.

505
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,023
Still not over her?

506
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,710
Out of all of us,

507
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,160
you had the most reason to
hate 'em after what she did.

508
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,270
- That's enough.

509
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,553
- She betrayed you.
- I said that's enough.

510
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:16,437
Kate's in the past.

511
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,700
- Do you really wanna
know what I've been doing

512
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,173
for the past five years?

513
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,213
Trying to find reasons to stay away.

514
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,827
I never lost faith in you, Harry.

515
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:35,879
- Faith is for the weak.

516
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:09,387
- Thank you, mister-
- Monroe.

517
00:55:09,387 --> 00:55:10,970
- Monroe.

518
00:56:24,954 --> 00:56:28,541
- Come back to me.

519
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,240
- Over seven million
hits on the CityCam network.

520
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,700
I thought you said it was cleared.

521
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,920
- We cut the feed as quick as we could.

522
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,440
I told you not to get Harrison involved.

523
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,090
He's dangerous.

524
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,790
- There's no one better for this job.

525
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:03,723
- Maybe, but he changed
since the accident.

526
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,980
I'm not sure where his
loyalties lie anymore.

527
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,660
- Listen, Harry moves fast.

528
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,610
He'll find this Dropa.

529
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:12,771
- He's unpredictable.

530
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,025
- You're not alone.

531
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,553
Death is not the end.

532
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,203
Death is just another road,

533
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,113
the road in life.

534
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,603
And your soul is the guide.

535
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,940
This is not over, Monroe.

536
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:57,094
- Arthur?

537
01:01:31,507 --> 01:01:35,007
- Want some?

538
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,530
- What made you come back?

539
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,123
- It's quieter here, less
distractions, you know.

540
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,460
- I don't know about that, Arthur.

541
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,750
You wanted outta here pretty bad

542
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,250
after your time in The Legion.

543
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,720
- That's what I thought, too.

544
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,843
But it's worse up there.

545
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,613
You know they're considering
complete isolationism.

546
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:49,923
No, the Colony's no place
for someone like me.

547
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,223
- Seems kinda isolated here.

548
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,253
- It's simpler.

549
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,053
- Yeah, I can see that.

550
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,563
- So, I take it this isn't a social visit.

551
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,583
- No.
- Good.

552
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,200
Let's keep it that way.

553
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,490
Business then?

554
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:27,413
- Dropa hunt.

555
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,683
- [Arthur] Who dragged you into this?

556
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,150
- Taft.

557
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,930
- You just can't say no to that sumbitch.

558
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,490
- It could've been any of us in that bar,

559
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,540
couple of nights ago.

560
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,993
- But it wasn't.

561
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,433
- Yeah, maybe so,
but that doesn't change things.

562
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,123
- Your loyalty's gonna
put you in a body bag.

563
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,963
- This Dropa is not like the others.

564
01:04:30,437 --> 01:04:33,243
They're usually runners not killers.

565
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,240
- We knew this was gonna come back on us.

566
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,100
We should've finished 'em
off when we had the chance.

567
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,930
- There were other
options for dealing with them

568
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:45,693
but The Party chose the easiest way out.

569
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,833
- There's a lot you still don't know.

570
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:53,010
- Maybe it's time you told me.

571
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,363
- Let's go out back.

572
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,892
- Why did it come after you?

573
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:53,670
We really did it, didn't we Monroe?

574
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,853
We took it all back from
those greedy bastards.

575
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,953
Everybody thought we were heroes then.

576
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:46,770
- Back in 2004,

577
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:50,350
we found a stone disc
washed ashore near Rockport

578
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,073
along with several cocoons.

579
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:59,351
The discs told the story of
the Dropas in hieroglyphics.

580
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:00,751
And then there was this one.

581
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,600
You see any pattern in all that?

582
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:07,293
- Not really.

583
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,773
- There are recognizable forms.

584
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:14,373
- Recognizable?
- Symbolic.

585
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,133
Very stylized.

586
01:07:20,463 --> 01:07:24,333
This first one, the oval, is a cocoon.

587
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,233
And this?

588
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,420
- I suppose it's...

589
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,060
First phase Dropa metamorphosis?

590
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:36,893
- Yes.

591
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,153
And next a human form.

592
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,753
And then this.

593
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,713
- What's that?

594
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:53,733
- It's what your hunting.

595
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:27,923
- Who else knew?

596
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,850
- Other than the need-to-know
personnel in The Party,

597
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,863
only Taft, Carter, and me.

598
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:42,480
I suspect Monroe would've
found out sometime later.

599
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:45,390
It was tight-lipped.

600
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:47,739
You have no idea

601
01:08:47,739 --> 01:08:50,733
how much worldwide hysteria
it would've caused.

602
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,443
Even more than the virus.

603
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,250
- What do you mean even
more than the virus?

604
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,233
- It was all a cover, Harry.

605
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:11,807
The virus was spread
through the atmosphere

606
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,803
in small, controlled amounts,

607
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:17,733
in geographically specific locations.

608
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,933
The same pattern as the Dropa migration.

609
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,870
The virus was nothing more

610
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:28,173
than a mutated strain of
a viral hemorrhagic fever.

611
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,443
There was nothing alien about it.

612
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,700
We manufactured the bug to
create just enough fear to-

613
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,903
- Just enough fear?

614
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,680
I knew people who died from that virus.

615
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,553
- We all did.

616
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,033
Calculated risk, unfortunately.

617
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,029
If one of those things got out-

618
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:52,320
- It would've killed over 20
million people like the virus?

619
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,213
That's controllable, measurable?

620
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,140
Who decides who lives and who dies?

621
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,990
- The Dropas were a potential threat.

622
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,570
We just had to disguise the reason why

623
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,793
and use it to create unity,

624
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,253
unity in The Party.

625
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:12,453
- We committed genocide.
- No.

626
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,573
Genocide is for humans.

627
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,290
I preferred...

628
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:20,343
Extinction.

629
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:25,380
It was them or us.

630
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,510
Now, I don't know about you,

631
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:30,120
but I prefer to be on the
us side of the equation.

632
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,343
- I was referring to humans.

633
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:35,883
- We're just pawns.

634
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,183
It's always been that way.

635
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:43,163
You've been around long
enough to know that.

636
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,431
- It's time things changed.

637
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:59,130
- It's not so easy when
the prey fights back,

638
01:10:59,130 --> 01:10:59,963
is it, old man?

639
01:11:05,443 --> 01:11:07,263
- How's that for easy?

640
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,310
- What are you doing?

641
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,570
- Why did you come back?

642
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,267
Or maybe you didn't.

643
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:34,601
- Wakey, wakey.

644
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:39,626
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

645
01:12:42,142 --> 01:12:45,273
- Well, this is embarrassing.

646
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,210
- Where's Arthur?

647
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,593
- It's still me, Harry.

648
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:54,183
It's just a synth body, an android.

649
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:56,673
We're bio-linked.

650
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:00,723
I wasn't safe down there.

651
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:03,960
I'm better off in the Colony,

652
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,283
least for the time being.

653
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,253
I hope you understand.

654
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,470
- I don't know what to believe.

655
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:20,163
- You still don't realize what
we were dealing with here.

656
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,190
The longer it's out there,

657
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,353
the less chance you'll be able to stop it.

658
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,930
- How am I supposed to kill something

659
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:29,523
that constantly evolves?

660
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,333
- Taft picked you for a reason.

661
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,983
You understand the Dropas.

662
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,030
- If that's an off-handed
reference to Kate

663
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,380
then leave her out of this.

664
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,623
- Oh, I didn't mean it like that.

665
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,013
No one blames you.

666
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,073
She fooled all of us.

667
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,240
I've never seen a Dropa

668
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,063
with such complete
human genetic synthesis.

669
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,713
Kate was unique.

670
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,193
She had a great ass too.

671
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,160
- Don't mention her again.

672
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,020
- A little levity is needed
here, don't you think?

673
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:24,093
Helps us keep a level head.

674
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:30,453
Besides, this thing is
much bigger than you or me.

675
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,820
- The girl I questioned about Monroe,

676
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,350
said the exact same thing.

677
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:39,360
- Sure she did.

678
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,043
- What are you telling me?

679
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:43,532
- Yelena Adamov.

680
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,393
The Party had me work an
angle on her for six months.

681
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,080
She didn't know what her
real role was anyway.

682
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,363
She just kept on fighting the good fight.

683
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,520
- She was a part of all this?

684
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:03,567
- Wakey, wakey.

685
01:15:03,567 --> 01:15:05,343
- And you set up Monroe!

686
01:15:07,747 --> 01:15:09,993
- A miscalculation.

687
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:13,533
- Miscalculation?
- The Dropa was the target.

688
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:17,103
Just didn't go as planned.

689
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,403
Didn't know what we were dealing
with until it was too late.

690
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,383
Shame too.

691
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,680
I always liked Monroe.

692
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,443
- Yeah, I can tell you're
all broken up about it.

693
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,513
- More than you know.

694
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,163
It took us six months
to set this thing up.

695
01:15:39,356 --> 01:15:42,810
You have no idea how to
make things so covert.

696
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:44,253
We had to keep quiet.

697
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:49,260
Even Taft was kept in the
dark about most of it.

698
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,763
- And you played both of us.

699
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,719
- I had no intention of bringing you in.

700
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,043
That was Taft.

701
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,553
- And Yelena?

702
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:04,370
- I had to uh...

703
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,840
Quiet her.

704
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,850
- If the Dropas presented
this much of a threat,

705
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:11,016
why didn't we just finish them off?

706
01:16:11,016 --> 01:16:12,120
- If it were up to me,

707
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,920
I would've finished what we started.

708
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,303
But, the females didn't pose a threat.

709
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,933
It was the two bull males.

710
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:26,133
We needed their genetic codes.

711
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,693
Stepwise Evolution.

712
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:34,660
That's what the scientists
back East called it.

713
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:38,070
- Stepwise Evolution?
- Well, something

714
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,774
about adding additional Dropa amino acids

715
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:41,288
to the human genetic code.

716
01:16:41,288 --> 01:16:42,121
- Jesus.

717
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:48,420
- Dropas have incredible
regenerative qualities.

718
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,598
- Where is the other male?

719
01:16:50,598 --> 01:16:53,790
- Tagged.

720
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:55,013
He's dormant.
- Dormant?

721
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,263
Was this one dormant?
- Yes.

722
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:02,030
Until he figured out how
to remove his tracer.

723
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,080
But the other male is not a threat.

724
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:07,913
- Yet.

725
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,673
- Harry.

726
01:17:12,652 --> 01:17:15,513
What do you remember after the accident?

727
01:17:16,824 --> 01:17:18,600
What about all those months you spent

728
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,920
at the clinic with Kate?

729
01:17:34,643 --> 01:17:36,847
- Leave Kate out of this.

730
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:07,665
 What's that?

731
01:18:09,463 --> 01:18:12,463
- It's what you're hunting.

732
01:18:31,598 --> 01:18:35,005
- I wish Mommy was still with us.

733
01:18:35,005 --> 01:18:36,588
- Oh, my solnyshko.

734
01:18:41,672 --> 01:18:43,005
We will be fine.

735
01:18:45,029 --> 01:18:48,930
And I will never let
anything happen to you.

736
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,440
- Where have you been?

737
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,910
- Working a lead.

738
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:06,743
- Taft's dead.

739
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:09,780
This thing knows how to find us.

740
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,000
The coroner's report from Monroe's attack

741
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,022
found small traces of liquid dysprosium.

742
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:16,050
- Dysprosium?

743
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:18,360
- It's an element that was
used in fusion reactors,

744
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,950
prior to balthorium.

745
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:22,740
Outdated now and rarely used.

746
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,343
The data scan found one regional
location where it's stored.

747
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,220
It's a warehouse in the ship channel.

748
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,053
I'm gonna check it out.

749
01:19:30,053 --> 01:19:31,260
- I'll go with you.

750
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:32,400
- I'm on it.

751
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,630
- Just wait until I get there.

752
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,620
- No time for that.

753
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,030
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

754
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:37,150
This could get ugly real fast.

755
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:39,450
- I know what I'm dealing with, Harrison.

756
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:42,306
The question is, do you?

757
01:20:06,684 --> 01:20:07,987
- Oh.

758
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,640
- You okay?

759
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,473
- What's wrong?

760
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:21,857
- Taft's dead.

761
01:20:23,721 --> 01:20:25,679
I was worried.

762
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,729
C.O.N.T.A.G. tried to locate you on RFID.

763
01:20:28,813 --> 01:20:30,843
- I know how to handle myself.

764
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:33,800
I removed the sensor years ago Harry.

765
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,750
- It's not safe here.

766
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,580
You need to get outta the city.

767
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,420
I have to find Carter.

768
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,650
She has a lead on this Dropa.

769
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,300
- I'm gonna go with you.
- Not this time.

770
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,430
Things are different.
- No!

771
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:45,570
You don't need to do this.

772
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,190
Okay, just walk away.

773
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,350
Let Carter deal with it.

774
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,480
- Taft brought me into this for a reason.

775
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,090
- You have no loyalty to him.

776
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,490
- He's the reason I'm still breathing.

777
01:20:56,490 --> 01:21:00,210
- You're alive because you didn't give up.

778
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:02,043
- Not giving up didn't save me.

779
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,323
Between Taft and Kate,

780
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,078
I owe them.

781
01:21:07,078 --> 01:21:08,703
- You owe them nothing.

782
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,640
You gave everything to The Legion

783
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,437
and Taft repaid you by what,

784
01:21:13,437 --> 01:21:15,840
putting you back out there?

785
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,863
And Kate?

786
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,893
Really?

787
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:23,857
You need to understand who
really cares about you.

788
01:21:32,307 --> 01:21:33,480
Open your eyes.

789
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,533
What are you so afraid of?

790
01:21:51,318 --> 01:21:52,151
- Nothing.

791
01:22:28,301 --> 01:22:31,218
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] Harry, she's gone.

792
01:23:13,117 --> 01:23:14,760
- C.O.N.T.A.G.,

793
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,760
give me a report on warehouses
in the ship channel,

794
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,593
reference dysprosium.

795
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,380
- [C.O.N.T.A.G.] One warehouse
matching export records

796
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,180
for dysprosium.

797
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:30,480
Location in Fallout Zone 12.

798
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,400
Potential for rad absorption levels,

799
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,987
200 to 300 units.

800
01:26:49,357 --> 01:26:52,143
- What kind of man are you?

801
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,688
- The killing kind.

802
01:27:24,808 --> 01:27:26,308
- Come back to me.

803
01:27:56,128 --> 01:27:58,461
- What scares you?

804
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:06,393
Perhaps, not knowing who you are.

805
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,060
- You don't know me.

806
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,863
- You were trained for war.

807
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:22,833
Mankind's gift to the universe.

808
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,413
And you're fighting for what?

809
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:30,683
Nothing.

810
01:28:32,658 --> 01:28:33,491
But you,

811
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:42,067
you might be different now.

812
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:44,843
- Different?

813
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:47,063
- Yes.

814
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,093
I am different.

815
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,753
Would you like to see?

816
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,479
Now, do you see?

817
01:29:22,795 --> 01:29:27,100
The Legion has taken everything from me.

818
01:29:28,984 --> 01:29:31,413
And now all that is left is this hate.

819
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:37,360
Just like a human.

820
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:41,253
- You're not human.

821
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:45,483
- No.

822
01:29:47,371 --> 01:29:48,871
I am so much more.

823
01:29:59,073 --> 01:30:01,060
Have you ever lost someone?

824
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:05,570
Then you know what it's like.

825
01:30:07,662 --> 01:30:10,370
- What? Pain?

826
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,780
- No.

827
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,640
Pain is easy to control,

828
01:30:17,555 --> 01:30:19,623
to hide.

829
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:28,010
Revenge, that is not so easy.

830
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:35,943
You are here to kill me
to avenge their deaths.

831
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,563
But part of you does not want to do it.

832
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,693
Why?

833
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:46,563
Perhaps it is because I am more like you

834
01:30:47,955 --> 01:30:49,955
and you are more like...

835
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:15,098
 That's it, little man.

836
01:31:15,098 --> 01:31:17,348
Become that which you hunt.

837
01:31:25,373 --> 01:31:26,373
- That's it.

838
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:29,061
Keep coming.

839
01:31:29,061 --> 01:31:29,894
Come on.

840
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:39,903
- You cannot run away from who you are.

841
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:43,049
- Who's running?

842
01:34:41,373 --> 01:34:43,673
- Told you someone's
gonna keep an eye on you.

843
01:35:49,407 --> 01:35:52,260
- What do you remember after the accident?

844
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:53,840
What about all those months you spent

845
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,113
at the clinic with Kate?

846
01:35:56,322 --> 01:35:58,640
- When this is done,

847
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,660
whatever it is,

848
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:03,630
my advice is for you to leave the city.

849
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,780
- There's a traitor in The Legion.

850
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:08,377
- What scares you?

851
01:36:09,616 --> 01:36:12,366
Perhaps, not knowing who you are.

852
01:36:27,496 --> 01:36:32,496
- Open your eyes.
