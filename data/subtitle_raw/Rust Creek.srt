00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,300
<i>Hi, Sawyer.
It's Cindy Mansfield</i>

3
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:28,802
<i>from Landler-Bayne calling.</i>

4
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:31,170
<i>I just wanted to confirm
your interview this week..</i>

5
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:33,306
- Yes.
- <i>We are looking at a few other candidates.</i>

6
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:35,809
<i>But as you know we were all
very impressed with the work</i>

7
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:39,112
<i>you did last summer and we have
a great feeling about you.</i>

8
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:41,048
<i>I've emailed you
all the details</i>

9
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,016
<i>so we will see you
on Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.</i>

10
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:45,552
<i>at our offices in DC
Safe drive!</i>

11
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:43,142
<i>State police are on the scene</i>

12
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,509
<i>rerouting traffic
to surface streets</i>

13
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,579
<i>that's gonna create a little
bit of chaos here</i>

14
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:48,080
<i>but that's holiday
traffic for you.</i>

15
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:49,749
<i>Yeah, it's a nightmare
down there.</i>

16
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,850
<i>Just in time for Thanksgiving
weekend, unfortunately.</i>

17
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:52,484
<i>Rerouting.</i>

18
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,987
<i>If you're traveling around that
area, your best bet is to stay</i>

19
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,889
<i>as far away from the highway
as possible.</i>

20
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:59,058
<i>We will keep you informed
throughout the day</i>

21
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,895
<i>only on 1270 WLUN, Kentucky.</i>

22
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:06,531
<i>Okay, would you rather have
a room full of pennies</i>

23
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:10,769
<i>or a stack of pennies as high
as the Empire State Building?</i>

24
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:13,505
<i>Uh, I think I'd take
the big stack.</i>

25
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:14,773
<i>I'd be rich.</i>

26
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,110
<i>Weak.</i>

27
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,180
<i>Rerouting to Washington, DC.</i>

28
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:35,052
<i>In 30 miles, turn right.</i>

29
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,518
<i>In 500 feet make a right turn.</i>

30
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,625
<i>Make a right turn.</i>

31
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:31,743
It's not even a road.

32
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,085
Guess we're taking
the next right.

33
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:54,230
<i>Make a U-turn, if possible.</i>

34
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:57,135
Give me better directions,
if possible.

35
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:46,316
<i>Make a U-turn, if possible.</i>

36
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,159
<i>Turn left.</i>

37
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,806
Think they seen us?

38
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:18,681
Okay.

39
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:33,062
This doesn't make any sense.
Just reroute me.

40
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:07,396
Yes!
Suck it, phone!

41
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,567
You need some help there, miss?

42
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:25,370
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I'm just stretching my legs.

43
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,374
Yeah. And your map.

44
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,210
Right. I'm just getting
my bearings.

45
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,811
Yeah, we seen you up
there and thought

46
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,548
maybe you was having
some sort of trouble.

47
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,417
Oh, no. I'm... I'm just passing
through.

48
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,652
You sure you're okay?

49
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:43,622
You look a little upset.

50
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,490
And these woods,
they can be a crazy place

51
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,993
especially
if you ain't familiar.

52
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,496
I guess I'm a little frustrated,
you know.

53
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:53,233
These maps aren't super useful.

54
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:59,203
Ain't that the truth.

55
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:01,473
So... so that's it then?

56
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:05,009
You're just a tourist passing
through here?

57
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:09,146
Yeah? Well shit, if it's directions
you're looking for, me and Buck..

58
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:12,082
That's my brother Buck there.

59
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:15,054
We lived here our whole lives.
So we can get you most anywhere.

60
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:20,424
Uh, well, um, do you know
the best way back to 64?

61
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:22,326
I-64?

62
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,029
That's quite a ways.

63
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:27,231
You're lucky you ran into us.

64
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,666
Yeah.

65
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,534
'Cause there ain't but a couple
roads run through these hills

66
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:34,771
and well, you know, you got
yourself turned around nowhere.

67
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:37,907
Alright. See here? Right here.

68
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,544
You just keep on this way

69
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:43,214
and you'll make yourself
back to the highway, okay.

70
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,382
But you'll be backtracking
quite a bit.

71
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:47,750
Well, guess I'm taking
the scenic route.

72
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:51,754
Yeah. I guess you are.

73
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:56,928
Alright.

74
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:06,135
Oh, hey, hey!
Almost forgot. Your map.

75
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:08,073
Oh, thanks.

76
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:15,445
Say, you won't make it anywhere
before sundown

77
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:17,313
and we live just up a ways.

78
00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:19,582
So how about you come on over
for some dinner?

79
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:22,153
- Holli, shouldn't we just...
- Oh, he ain't going anywhere.

80
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:27,626
What do you say?

81
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,394
Thanks, but I really should be
getting going, so...

82
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:35,098
No.. That... that... that might
not be the best idea.

83
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,934
I mean, you got lost driving around
here and that was in broad daylight.

84
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:41,439
And you don't wanna be out here
after dark, trust me.

85
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:45,974
Listen, no offense, but you are
starting to make me feel

86
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:48,444
very uncomfortable right now.

87
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,613
Is that a fact?

88
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:53,115
Well, listen, we just want you
to, uh... uh, be comfortable.

89
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:54,783
That's all we want.

90
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:57,419
And it's gonna get real cold
out here real quick.

91
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:59,589
So why don't you just
come on back up to our place?

92
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,090
We'll have a drink or two

93
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:04,993
maybe, you know,
smoke a little somethin'?

94
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,397
It'd be like a little party.

95
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:10,065
Yeah? Come on, let's all..

96
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,546
Goddamn! Bitch cut me!

97
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:26,981
Yah!

98
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:29,685
- Now hold on a second, honey.
- Fuck off!

99
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,622
Get that knife away from her!

100
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,572
She's gettin' away.

101
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,122
That way. That way.

102
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:18,427
- You sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

103
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,849
Okay.
I can figure this out.

104
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,718
Yeah.

105
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,558
Definitely.

106
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,066
Shit!

107
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,283
It's going to be fine.

108
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,922
Everything's going to be fine.

109
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,418
Fording County Sheriff's Office,
Deputy Katz speaking.

110
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,754
Hold on.

111
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,323
Sheriff, line one.

112
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,891
This is O'Doyle.

113
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,225
<i>Hey, sheriff</i>

114
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:45,160
<i>this is Penny
from the Charleston office.</i>

115
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,963
<i>I have a stranded vehicle
report</i>

116
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,932
<i>for that two-five-oh
county road.</i>

117
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,699
<i>If we could get
your registration report</i>

118
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,268
<i>as soon as possible, our office
is gonna be closed</i>

119
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,071
<i>due to the holiday.</i>

120
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:57,439
Penny, could you, uh, could you
hold on a minute, honey?

121
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,507
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

122
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,541
What she want?

123
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:00,976
<i>Uh, just an abandoned car.</i>

124
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:02,978
Uh, it got me thinking.

125
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,280
That, uh, hanging fella,
the Hispanic.

126
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,216
- What's his name?
- That's Edwin Garro.

127
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:08,617
Yeah, yeah, that Garro fella.

128
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,353
We should see if he had any
vehicles registered in his name.

129
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:13,722
Check them against
abandon vehicle reports.

130
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:14,990
You think this might be his car?

131
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:17,158
No, no, timeline's all wrong

132
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,095
but maybe something got
picked up last week.

133
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:24,265
Uh, it's a long shot, but,
you know, due diligence and all.

134
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,669
I'm on it.

135
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,737
Hello, Penny.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

136
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,575
Uh, so you say it's up
on 250, huh?

137
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:35,228
Hey!

138
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,220
Okay.

139
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:14,399
Hey! Over here!
Help!

140
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,670
Ah.

141
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:22,442
Ow.

142
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,939
Phew!

143
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:59,577
<i>Well, dangit!</i>

144
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,112
You're just as quiet
as a cottonmouth

145
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:02,413
when you wanna be, huh?

146
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,082
You here on official business,
sheriff

147
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:07,218
or this is just a social call?

148
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,555
I ain't here to take a bunch of
lip, you can count on that.

149
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:12,557
I got a call
about an abandoned vehicle

150
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,859
at the bend,
down by Rust Creek.

151
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:17,829
Well, as you can see, we prefer
to abandon our vehicles

152
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:19,264
right here at home.

153
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:21,866
Well, I just seen you and Buck
tramplin' up from that creek

154
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:23,768
every damn day, so, uh

155
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,303
when I get a call
from the state police...

156
00:22:25,305 --> 00:22:28,206
State? What do the staties
gotta do with it?

157
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,341
Nothing, yet.

158
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:32,210
If we seen something
I'd tell you

159
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:35,313
but the plain fact is
we weren't up there.

160
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:37,115
Now you can come out here
puffing up your chest

161
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:40,517
all you want,
but it don't change the facts.

162
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,223
Boy, you must think I'm some
kinda a prize dummy, huh?

163
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,757
Well I got news for you..

164
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,594
Easy, sheriff!

165
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:52,097
Jesus!

166
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:57,069
You a bit, you a bit jumpy,
Quickdraw.

167
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:02,041
You hurt there?

168
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:05,742
Huntin' accident.

169
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:07,476
Oh, you're bleeding right there.

170
00:23:07,478 --> 00:23:09,012
You should get that stitched up.

171
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,447
It's just a scratch.

172
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:13,817
Did you get that scratch
up by Rust Creek?

173
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:15,688
Like I said..

174
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,524
...we ain't been up there
in days.

175
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,596
Alright, well..

176
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:29,366
I tried.

177
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,802
I tried.

178
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:06,871
Ah.

179
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:59,081
Oh, shit!

180
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:17,933
Ow. Good as new.

181
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:30,246
Everything's fine.

182
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:35,584
Somebody will see the car..

183
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,955
They'll find me here.

184
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,701
I'm in the fucking woods.

185
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:31,522
<i>Whoo! Holy shit!</i>

186
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:34,625
<i>- Ha-ha-ha!
- That was amazing!</i>

187
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:36,729
<i>That shit was amazing!</i>

188
00:29:37,962 --> 00:29:39,962
<i>Did you see that fucker fly?</i>

189
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,803
<i>Come on, Buck.
Let's go check it out!</i>

190
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:06,356
Ho-ly shit.

191
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:10,560
Will you look at this? We
bull's-eyed a goddamn oak tree!

192
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,666
They ain't never gonna send
nobody this far off road.

193
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:19,968
Ah, shit. Now all we gotta do is
find that bitch.

194
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,305
She was cut pretty deep, Holli.

195
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,407
She ain't gonna last
out here too long.

196
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:25,641
Can't we just go back...

197
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:26,975
Not until they find a body
we're gonna have

198
00:30:26,977 --> 00:30:29,144
O'Doyle and the staties
up our asses, Buck.

199
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:31,848
But if they find her, won't they
be all over the place anyway?

200
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,415
No, not all over.

201
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,017
Just around where they find
the body.

202
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,587
Get it? Good.

203
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,321
Come on,
we'll start at the creek

204
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,657
work our way back down the road.

205
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:44,459
- Fuck.
- Move your fat ass. This way.

206
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:46,695
<i>Let's go.</i>

207
00:30:46,697 --> 00:30:48,766
<i>Come on, now watch your steps
there, Buck.</i>

208
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,248
Oh, my God!

209
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:43,717
Oh.

210
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,630
Come on.

211
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,781
Ain't even dry.

212
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:23,992
Come on.

213
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:28,764
Come on.

214
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:18,813
Oh, come on.

215
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:27,621
Come on.

216
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:30,324
There.

217
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:11,922
Mom.

218
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:16,095
Uh, if you ever get this
somehow, I..

219
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,668
...I wanted you to know that..

220
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,238
...I... I should..

221
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:24,088
Who are you?

222
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:27,724
Oh, my God.

223
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,765
What are you doing out here?

224
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:48,529
God!

225
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:52,998
Who the fuck are you?

226
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,233
You were supposed to drink that.

227
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:56,735
Stay the hell away from me.

228
00:39:56,737 --> 00:39:59,707
Put that down. Put that down.

229
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:08,546
Take another step and I'll throw
this in your fucking face.

230
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:10,382
- Careful now. That's my..
- I'm serious, motherfucker!

231
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:11,785
I'll burn your fucking face off!

232
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:28,666
What the fuck..

233
00:40:57,596 --> 00:40:59,831
- Hey! What was all that about?
- Hey.

234
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,265
Oh, just sheriff stuff.

235
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,799
Did you ask them about that SUV?

236
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:06,371
Um, I didn't know you were
taking on "The Big SUV Case."

237
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:09,706
I... I'm just curious. You know,
d... did they have an alibi?

238
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,376
Alibi for... for what?

239
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:13,111
For whatever was going on
with that SUV.

240
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:15,446
Nick, do you, do you have such
an abundance of free time

241
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:18,048
that you need to invent crimes
to investigate

242
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,150
just to stave off the boredom?

243
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:20,418
No, sir, I just...

244
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,919
Because if you do,
I would love someone to tackle

245
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:24,755
"The Case of the Moving
Violations Paperwork

246
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:26,592
That's Backed Up to Early
October."

247
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:30,729
Point taken, sheriff.

248
00:41:38,103 --> 00:41:41,104
But that SUV thing, I mean,
doesn't that seem odd to you?

249
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:44,041
A vehicle like that, abandoned,
in the middle of the day

250
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,810
no driver in sight?

251
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:48,211
Are you second guessing me, son?

252
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:49,946
No, sir. But..

253
00:41:52,317 --> 00:41:53,684
Speak plain.

254
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:59,289
You do have
a way of treating the locals

255
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,723
with a certain deference.

256
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:04,560
Nick... you're a good deputy.

257
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:06,063
You're a good man.

258
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,432
I appreciate your commitment.

259
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,933
So I'm just gonna say this
one time

260
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:12,703
and I think it oughta be enough.

261
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:16,373
Chief.

262
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,909
Indian.

263
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:20,845
<i>Mind your place.</i>

264
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,847
And, uh, as far as them
Pritcherts are concerned

265
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:27,149
I've been arrestin' them boys
since they were in grade school.

266
00:42:27,151 --> 00:42:29,685
And they are trouble,
that's for sure

267
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,720
but they ain't got the brains

268
00:42:31,722 --> 00:42:33,457
between the two of 'em
to be dangerous.

269
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:37,159
And moreover,
that mysterious SUV

270
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:40,429
moved along some time yesterday.

271
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:43,399
- Oh.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

272
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:45,034
Oh.

273
00:42:45,036 --> 00:42:46,102
Yeah.

274
00:42:46,104 --> 00:42:48,003
Likely just run out of gas then?

275
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:49,538
Likely.

276
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,575
Oh.

277
00:42:51,576 --> 00:42:52,609
Okay.

278
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,812
Say, sheriff,
do you have any objection to me

279
00:42:57,814 --> 00:42:59,148
calling the registered owner?

280
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,683
You know, just to put
this whole thing to bed?

281
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:04,652
Uh, if it'll give you some peace
of mind, son

282
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:06,522
go right on ahead.

283
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:07,691
Right.

284
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:30,380
Eat this.

285
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:58,241
Uh-uh. Knock it off.

286
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,481
You lost blood.

287
00:44:05,748 --> 00:44:07,681
You need to eat.

288
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:09,452
I need a hospital
and the police.

289
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,621
Eat.

290
00:44:18,928 --> 00:44:20,863
Suit yourself.

291
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:25,628
What's your name?

292
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:39,007
I'm Sawyer.

293
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:45,913
- <i>Sawyer Scott.</i>
- Shut up and eat.

294
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,419
I go to Centre College.
I'm a senior.

295
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:56,222
I was on my way to DC
for a this big job interview

296
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:58,626
and my stupid GPS got me lost.

297
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:11,472
These two guys jumped me.

298
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:22,049
I'm sure my friends
are worried about me.

299
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,286
<i>And my parents..</i>

300
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,422
Quiet.

301
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:31,724
<i>...and if you could
just untie me</i>

302
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:32,857
<i>and take me to the police,
you'd be a hero.</i>

303
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:34,192
Shh.

304
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:36,161
I wouldn't even mention the..

305
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,431
This.

306
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,001
Might even be a reward.

307
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:53,146
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

308
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:58,452
If they find you here
they'll kill you.

309
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:02,289
Keep quiet,
or I can't help you.

310
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:32,416
There he is.

311
00:47:32,418 --> 00:47:35,855
Serious as ever.
Hello, cuz.

312
00:47:36,555 --> 00:47:39,158
Hollister. Buck.

313
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:41,058
What happened here?

314
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,262
Aw, just some horseplay.
You know.

315
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,196
Sorry we ain't been up
to visit more.

316
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,232
Things just been
kinda crazy lately.

317
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:50,367
- Okay.
- No, no, it ain't.

318
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:54,671
We're family.
No excuse. You know.

319
00:47:54,673 --> 00:47:58,207
- So, how'd the last batch go?
- No problems.

320
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,511
<i>And the yield was what
we thought it would be?</i>

321
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:01,845
<i>More or less.</i>

322
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:03,913
<i>So we should be on target
for S... Saturday?</i>

323
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,883
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

324
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:09,051
<i>I get low on sudo
and some other stuff.</i>

325
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,486
<i>We're all set with that.</i>

326
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,355
<i>We'll be back up tomorrow
with more sudo, ammonia,</i>

327
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:13,389
<i>matches, whatever.</i>

328
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,424
<i>I'm good on ammonia</i>

329
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:17,393
<i>but I'm gonna need more lye.</i>

330
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,830
<i>You burned through that shit
pretty fast, didn't you?</i>

331
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:22,835
Well, hell.
What Lowell wants, Lowell gets.

332
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:27,470
Ask him about the girl, Holli.

333
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:29,639
Oh, yeah, about that.

334
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:33,109
Seems some girl went missing up
here a couple days ago

335
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,178
and Sheriff O'Doyle

336
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,181
he nearly crawled up
our ass about it.

337
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:40,118
I don't suppose
you seen anything?

338
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,652
I ain't seen no girl.

339
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:44,921
Okay. Do you mind
if we take a look around?

340
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:47,358
<i>- Free country.
- Yeah. It is at that.</i>

341
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,312
<i>Nothin'.</i>

342
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,283
What's eatin' you?

343
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,086
Tell me, cousin

344
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,922
how many times me
and Buck been up here

345
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:22,892
since we got
this trailer set up?

346
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:24,326
Dozen or so.

347
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,962
And every time we do,
uh, I mean

348
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:28,029
hell, even Buck
could tell you.

349
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,564
What's the first thing
that we do?

350
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,668
Go in and have a beer.

351
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:33,935
<i>Right.</i>

352
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,537
Right.

353
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,972
But today when we come up here

354
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,473
<i>and you step outside to meet us</i>

355
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,242
<i>and stand there the whole time</i>

356
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:43,245
in the middle
of the fucking rain

357
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:46,182
<i>like you're some kinda
goddamn guard dog.</i>

358
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,494
<i>You got something to say?</i>

359
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,097
<i>I think I'm saying it.</i>

360
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,967
<i>We tracked that girl
up here yesterday.</i>

361
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,237
Trail went cold
not a hundred yards away.

362
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:15,476
You found yourself
some fun, didn't you?

363
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:17,344
Didn't you, huh?

364
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:21,317
I had a accident
with the lye is all.

365
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,620
Place is full of fumes.

366
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:29,425
Lowell..

367
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,460
...it hurts my feelings
when you treat me

368
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:35,731
like I'm some kind
of goddamn idiot.

369
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,334
Now, how about
we go on inside

370
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:41,837
and have a look.

371
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:05,260
She ain't in there.

372
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:27,181
Oh..

373
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:56,434
You shouldn't be here.

374
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:57,903
You're hurting me.

375
00:52:57,905 --> 00:52:59,672
Better me than them.

376
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:04,508
Next time
I tell you to stay put

377
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,011
you stay put!

378
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,633
- Suicide?
- Yeah.

379
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:31,068
So you think
it's just coincidence

380
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,671
that this Hispanic fella
from out of town

381
00:53:33,673 --> 00:53:36,207
offed himself right when
we got Mexican drugs

382
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:37,541
flooding the state?

383
00:53:37,543 --> 00:53:38,943
I... I couldn't say.

384
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:41,979
But in Fording County

385
00:53:41,981 --> 00:53:44,181
suicide seems to make
a lot more sense

386
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:47,084
than some cartel gang thing.

387
00:53:47,086 --> 00:53:49,653
Maybe. That doesn't
sound right to me.

388
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:51,287
So, we gonna wait
on the coroner.

389
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:54,024
Now also, Penny from Dispatch
wanted me to follow up

390
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:55,258
on an abandoned vehicle.

391
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,229
Oh! That wasn't nothin'.
Moved on the same day.

392
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:00,231
Oh, well, uh..

393
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:02,099
Well, you got something
to add, deputy?

394
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:03,833
Uh..

395
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:05,236
Go on, Katz.

396
00:54:05,238 --> 00:54:08,271
That vehicle was registered
to a couple over in Paducah

397
00:54:08,273 --> 00:54:09,405
but they gave
it to their daughter.

398
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,440
Now, she's over...

399
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:12,308
Why don't you
just get to the part

400
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,213
where you tell us the bad news.

401
00:54:15,947 --> 00:54:18,948
The driver's name
is, uh, Sawyer Scott

402
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:22,552
and apparently nobody seems
to know where she is at.

403
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:23,820
She's missing?

404
00:54:23,822 --> 00:54:25,622
Well, her roommates
said that she was going home

405
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,590
for Thanksgiving,
but her folks said

406
00:54:27,592 --> 00:54:29,092
that she was staying
on campus.

407
00:54:29,094 --> 00:54:31,027
When was the last time
she was seen?

408
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:32,962
Monday morning.

409
00:54:32,964 --> 00:54:34,264
Monday morning?

410
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:35,965
I... I just got off the phone
with the mother

411
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:39,569
and she said that the girl's
not answering her phone.

412
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:42,404
Look, that was before you send
out your storm troopers

413
00:54:42,406 --> 00:54:44,741
start trampling out
people's flower beds

414
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:46,709
and kicking down their doors.

415
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:48,812
Let's just make sure
she's not

416
00:54:48,814 --> 00:54:51,114
passed out
in Virginia Beach somewhere.

417
00:54:51,116 --> 00:54:54,050
Jesus Christ, O'Doyle

418
00:54:54,052 --> 00:54:56,652
you think I enjoy
doing your job for you?

419
00:54:56,654 --> 00:54:59,122
I'm not about to send my men
traipsing through the woods

420
00:54:59,124 --> 00:55:01,057
on Thanksgiving
if I don't have to.

421
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:03,927
<i>But you better get a line
on this girl soon</i>

422
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:05,794
or you gonna have
state police choppers

423
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:08,233
<i>blocking out
the sun down here.</i>

424
00:55:10,467 --> 00:55:12,736
- Deputy.
- Sir.

425
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:19,211
- Sorry, sheriff...
- Save it.

426
00:55:20,644 --> 00:55:23,080
We got a picture
of this missing girl?

427
00:55:32,022 --> 00:55:34,357
Pretty clever how you
burned through them ropes.

428
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:39,462
- <i>What is that stuff?</i>
- Lye.

429
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:42,867
- Is that some kind of acid?
- <i>Base.</i>

430
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:45,067
Burns like acid.

431
00:55:45,069 --> 00:55:46,737
Bases burn too.

432
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:51,139
And the milk,
that neutralized it?

433
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:53,708
Milk ain't acid enough
to neutralize lye.

434
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,843
You'd need something like..

435
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:58,080
...like vinegar
to neutralize lye.

436
00:55:58,082 --> 00:56:01,449
So why don't you have
some vinegar handy?

437
00:56:01,451 --> 00:56:05,453
<i>You know what happens when
you mix an acid with a base?</i>

438
00:56:05,455 --> 00:56:07,688
Neutralizes it?

439
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,024
Yeah, with so much heat

440
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:12,526
it burn you worse
than the lye did.

441
00:56:12,528 --> 00:56:14,464
Thought you were
a college girl.

442
00:56:16,633 --> 00:56:18,735
I'm not a chemistry major.

443
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:38,420
Well, that's why milk's better.

444
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:41,190
Less reaction.

445
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,194
Still burned quite a bit,
thank you.

446
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:48,528
Why do you know
so much about this stuff?

447
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,301
I've been cooking meth
since I was 14 years old.

448
00:56:52,936 --> 00:56:55,537
You learn real quick
what all can burn you.

449
00:57:01,677 --> 00:57:03,279
You know..

450
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,050
...if you let me go
I won't tell them anything.

451
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:14,454
You say you're trying to help
me, but you're holding me here.

452
00:57:14,456 --> 00:57:16,324
Can't do it.

453
00:57:16,326 --> 00:57:19,526
I promise I won't
tell anyone anything.

454
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:20,727
If you just let me go.

455
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,563
We're five miles
from the nearest road.

456
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,766
Twenty from any kind of town.

457
00:57:26,768 --> 00:57:28,635
I got no car.

458
00:57:28,637 --> 00:57:31,204
<i>You wouldn't make it a
100 yards the shape you're in.</i>

459
00:57:31,206 --> 00:57:33,907
And even if you did,
the first person you met

460
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,910
would like as not hand you
right over to Hollister.

461
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,445
Bullshit.

462
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:40,981
- You just wanna keep me here.
- Quit it.

463
00:57:40,983 --> 00:57:42,514
You can't keep me here forever!

464
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:44,119
I said quit it.

465
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:52,827
You wanna try your luck out
in them woods, go on.

466
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:02,803
Hollister and Buck are going
into Charleston this weekend.

467
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:06,206
They'll leave their truck
at their mama's house.

468
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:08,109
I'll go down on Saturday
and I'll borrow it.

469
00:58:10,011 --> 00:58:11,746
And then I'll take you
someplace safe.

470
00:58:13,482 --> 00:58:14,949
Out of Fording County.

471
00:58:35,269 --> 00:58:37,509
I might need some help with
this one, heavy as a mother..

472
00:58:42,043 --> 00:58:45,177
Jesus Christ! O'Doyle?

473
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:48,180
I got some plain
questions for you

474
00:58:48,182 --> 00:58:49,849
and I want some plain answers.

475
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,818
- Is this about that car?
- Hell with the car.

476
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,156
Now, I got the state police
asking about a missing girl!

477
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,756
We did what you told us,
sheriff.

478
00:58:58,758 --> 00:59:00,591
Son, if you'd done
what I told you

479
00:59:00,593 --> 00:59:02,093
they would've found
that girl's body

480
00:59:02,095 --> 00:59:04,896
somewhere down
in Jonesboro County by now.

481
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:06,398
I still don't know
what the hell

482
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,565
you dimwits were thinking.

483
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:09,967
I told you,
okay, she come up on us

484
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:11,302
when we was burying
that bag of shit.

485
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:12,570
And we thought she seen
somethin'!

486
00:59:12,572 --> 00:59:14,972
Well, she seen something now.

487
00:59:14,974 --> 00:59:16,307
At this point, don't it figure
she already

488
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:17,809
out there in them woods
froze to death?

489
00:59:17,811 --> 00:59:20,111
It don't matter if she's out
there dead in a gully

490
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:21,913
or singin' on Bandstand.

491
00:59:21,915 --> 00:59:24,615
Without a body, these woods

492
00:59:24,617 --> 00:59:26,517
is gonna be crawling
with state police.

493
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:30,855
Well, she ain't been found,
okay? So, she's likely dead.

494
00:59:30,857 --> 00:59:34,292
The birds will be at her by now.
She'll be easier to spot.

495
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:36,060
We'll go out again tomorrow

496
00:59:36,062 --> 00:59:38,463
after we run this stuff
up to Lowell.

497
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:40,932
How's your cousin doing?

498
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:43,034
Weird.
Like, I don't even know him.

499
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:46,471
What I meant was,
are we still on schedule?

500
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:48,738
Hell, you know that ol' boy
don't do nothin' but cook.

501
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:52,110
Big batch here,
but we'll be right by Saturday.

502
00:59:52,112 --> 00:59:53,679
We'd better be.

503
01:00:13,365 --> 01:00:15,634
Breakfast is peaches
or bologna.

504
01:00:19,238 --> 01:00:20,770
What are you doing?

505
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:23,306
Cuttin' matchbooks.

506
01:00:23,308 --> 01:00:25,676
- What for?
- Cook meth.

507
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,847
I thought meth
was made from, like..

508
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:33,116
...ephedrine and Drano.

509
01:00:33,118 --> 01:00:34,119
And matchbooks.

510
01:00:35,287 --> 01:00:37,220
Why are you making meth?

511
01:00:37,222 --> 01:00:39,158
Isn't everyone doing
heroin now?

512
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:46,797
- I read.
- Can't cook heroin.

513
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:53,637
How many of them do you need?

514
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:55,070
Lots.

515
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:57,106
And what do you do
when you have them all cut up?

516
01:00:57,108 --> 01:00:59,911
- Mix that shit in.
- What's that shit?

517
01:01:01,212 --> 01:01:04,880
Why do you ask so many
damn questions?

518
01:01:04,882 --> 01:01:06,516
Never mind.

519
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:08,286
Just thought I might
learn something.

520
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:12,721
So..

521
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:15,625
...you don't really know
what you're doing.

522
01:01:15,627 --> 01:01:17,661
You're like one of those
European pop bands

523
01:01:17,663 --> 01:01:19,995
that sing in English
but don't actually know

524
01:01:19,997 --> 01:01:21,297
what any of the lyrics mean.

525
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,399
You sure ride high

526
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:25,067
<i>for a girl
who jammed her wet hands</i>

527
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:27,970
in a bucketful of lye yesterday.

528
01:01:27,972 --> 01:01:30,239
I wasn't being condescending.
I'm just saying.

529
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:32,575
You know, it's amazing they got you
doing all this complex chemistry

530
01:01:32,577 --> 01:01:34,512
and you don't even
have to understand it.

531
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,249
That ain't condescending?

532
01:01:40,884 --> 01:01:44,052
So... I've been thinking
about your plan

533
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:45,389
to borrow your truck.

534
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:51,025
I just don't know I should
stay up here for that long.

535
01:01:51,027 --> 01:01:52,461
I mean, it's okay
for a backup plan

536
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:55,230
but, you know, if you can
get me to a phone, then...

537
01:01:55,232 --> 01:01:56,898
Bad idea.

538
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,833
If I'm here when
those guys come back...

539
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:03,104
It's safer to keep you here
than to try and move you.

540
01:02:03,106 --> 01:02:06,241
I'm not really
a sit and wait type.

541
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:08,076
You don't say.

542
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:10,845
Listen, I just think I can come
up with a more proactive way to...

543
01:02:10,847 --> 01:02:12,782
Hey, would you hand me
that pitcher right there?

544
01:02:21,224 --> 01:02:24,961
- Why is it so cold?
- Just pour it in here.

545
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:28,298
<i>Real slow.</i>

546
01:02:33,436 --> 01:02:36,872
It's cold 'cause the acetone
inside, it's evaporating..

547
01:02:38,608 --> 01:02:42,343
...sucking away the energy
from what all it's touchin'.

548
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:46,314
Mix that with the matchbooks,
separate the red phosphorous.

549
01:02:46,316 --> 01:02:48,383
Then I'm gonna mix that
with iodine

550
01:02:48,385 --> 01:02:52,387
to get hydroiodic acid,
which I need to cook meth.

551
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:55,789
So you do all that
for just one ingredient?

552
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:57,592
That's the job.

553
01:02:57,594 --> 01:03:00,193
Like a bunch of little
science projects?

554
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:03,598
Combine this ingredient,
separate that one.

555
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:08,268
Yeah, and just about every one
of them will kill you.

556
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,837
Every one of 'em
is either corrosive

557
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:12,675
flammable, both.

558
01:03:14,276 --> 01:03:17,711
Methanol, acetone,
glycol, butane..

559
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:19,648
You thought
that lye was tough.

560
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,189
We used to cook with this.

561
01:03:28,557 --> 01:03:31,291
Anhydrous ammonia.

562
01:03:31,293 --> 01:03:34,161
In here it's just a liquid

563
01:03:34,163 --> 01:03:36,797
that'll burn your skin
right off.

564
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,466
Room temp, it turns
into poison gas.

565
01:03:39,468 --> 01:03:41,637
One spark..

566
01:03:57,919 --> 01:03:59,854
Hollister will be here soon.

567
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:27,881
- Oh, God.
- Lowell.

568
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,051
Low-ell.

569
01:04:32,553 --> 01:04:35,788
Low-ell. Low-ell.

570
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,790
L-O-L.

571
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,496
L-O-L. Get it?

572
01:04:55,777 --> 01:04:58,245
Hey, L-O-L!

573
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:02,983
Where you at?

574
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,823
- Hey.
- Just put that down there.

575
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,894
- Eh, what's cooking, Lowell?
- Try not to breathe.

576
01:05:15,896 --> 01:05:19,930
- Shouldn't we get masks?
- But I just got the one.

577
01:05:19,932 --> 01:05:23,737
- Best unload quick.
- Jesus Christ.

578
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:45,690
Thought you were gonna wait
around back of the trailer.

579
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,926
<i>What if Hollister
had come down here?</i>

580
01:05:47,928 --> 01:05:49,696
<i>Or Buck?</i>

581
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:53,497
What if they'd come
behind the trailer?

582
01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:57,234
<i>Well, I could have
kept 'em from there.</i>

583
01:05:57,236 --> 01:05:59,171
<i>You gotta learn to sit still.</i>

584
01:06:00,807 --> 01:06:05,609
So, that road I came from
is, is that way?

585
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:07,546
And that little town
is that way?

586
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,151
Yeah, that's Boone.

587
01:06:13,185 --> 01:06:14,918
But the nearest road
is Bishop

588
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,923
that way, to the east.

589
01:06:19,692 --> 01:06:21,627
<i>You fixing to make
a break for it?</i>

590
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:32,905
Your call.

591
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:37,375
<i>But if you're just restless,
I can put you to work.</i>

592
01:06:52,658 --> 01:06:55,759
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

593
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,226
I know what I said but..

594
01:06:57,228 --> 01:06:58,694
Baby, this girl
is still out there

595
01:06:58,696 --> 01:07:01,065
and her mama's been callin',
just worried sick.

596
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:04,100
We'll have plenty
of other Thanksgivings

597
01:07:04,102 --> 01:07:05,801
but this girl won't
if we don't find her soon.

598
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:07,603
- Nick!
- Y... yes, sheriff?

599
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:10,673
What are you still doing here?
It's almost dinnertime.

600
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:12,408
Well, I... I was just..
It's okay, I'm just..

601
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,310
No, no, the hell it is!

602
01:07:14,312 --> 01:07:15,811
It's your first
Thanksgiving together.

603
01:07:15,813 --> 01:07:17,680
You go home have dinner
with your wife.

604
01:07:17,682 --> 01:07:19,515
- But if I don't finish...
- That's an order, deputy.

605
01:07:19,517 --> 01:07:22,251
I think I can muddle through
without you for an hour or two.

606
01:07:22,253 --> 01:07:24,420
Bring me back a plate.

607
01:07:24,422 --> 01:07:27,023
- Go! Go, go go!
- Okay. Okay.

608
01:07:27,025 --> 01:07:30,927
Thank you, sheriff. Uh, babe,
sheriff's sending me home for dinner.

609
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:32,864
Just, uh, give me, give me 20.

610
01:07:38,603 --> 01:07:40,268
<i>You gotta speak up a bit.</i>

611
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,238
Yeah, I'm getting
in my cruiser right now.

612
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,406
Whipped cream?

613
01:07:44,408 --> 01:07:46,074
No, baby, no stores
are gonna be open

614
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:48,543
around here on Thanksgiving.

615
01:07:48,545 --> 01:07:51,546
Well, who says you need
whipped cream with pumpkin pie?

616
01:07:51,548 --> 01:07:53,783
No, I ain't driving all the..

617
01:07:53,785 --> 01:07:55,717
Oh, wait. Hang on, babe.

618
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:58,153
I think I got
some cream in the office.

619
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,090
I said I think I got some c..

620
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:03,858
Jenna, my phone's about to die.

621
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,961
I'll be home soon.

622
01:08:05,963 --> 01:08:07,397
I love you too.

623
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:13,068
<i>..tired of excuses, Hollister.</i>

624
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:17,104
<i>You come up with that fucking
girl's body, alright, or so he..</i>

625
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:20,107
<i>Listen, this is
my goddamn retirement</i>

626
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:24,079
and if you screw it up,
believe me, you will not live

627
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:26,081
long enough to regret it.

628
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,770
Hey, Nick.

629
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,707
Uh, look,
I... I can understand..

630
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:56,577
Just, you know, hearing
maybe half of that conversation

631
01:08:56,579 --> 01:08:58,712
it could be misconstrued.

632
01:08:58,714 --> 01:08:59,815
Right.

633
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:06,687
Come on, really?

634
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:07,855
Nick, look..

635
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:11,158
Well, let's just sit down
and talk about this.

636
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,694
I can hear you just fine
from over here, sheriff.

637
01:09:13,696 --> 01:09:17,131
You're not even gonna give me
a chance to explain?

638
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:18,233
I mean, I..

639
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:27,375
Easy now.

640
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:32,079
You'll have
your chance to explain.

641
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:34,180
But right now
I'm walking out of here

642
01:09:34,182 --> 01:09:35,785
and you're not stoppin' me.

643
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:02,444
It don't have
to be like this, Nick.

644
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:09,949
I'm sorry, sheriff.

645
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:11,951
But whatever you're into

646
01:10:11,953 --> 01:10:13,722
you're gonna
have to answer for it.

647
01:11:07,808 --> 01:11:10,642
Would you rather
have a room full of pennies

648
01:11:10,644 --> 01:11:13,580
or a stack of pennies as tall as
the Empire State Building?

649
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:19,920
Never mind.

650
01:11:25,424 --> 01:11:28,526
- I'd rather have the stack.
- What?

651
01:11:28,528 --> 01:11:30,829
I'd rather have
the stack of pennies.

652
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:32,099
Real tall.

653
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,434
A stack isn't many.

654
01:11:37,303 --> 01:11:39,737
The Empire State Building's
like a 100 stories high.

655
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:42,040
More than that
can fit in a closet.

656
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:44,775
If I had a stack
of pennies tall as that

657
01:11:44,777 --> 01:11:48,379
it'd be the most incredible
thing you ever saw.

658
01:11:48,381 --> 01:11:49,814
Right here, in the middle
of the Blue Ridge

659
01:11:49,816 --> 01:11:51,584
pennies to the sky..

660
01:11:52,752 --> 01:11:54,520
People'd come from miles.

661
01:12:02,495 --> 01:12:04,130
Hey, what day is it?

662
01:12:06,632 --> 01:12:07,900
Thursday.

663
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:11,637
Thanksgiving.

664
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,677
I guess you'd be
with your folks, huh?

665
01:12:19,278 --> 01:12:21,712
Actually,
I was ditchin' them this year

666
01:12:21,714 --> 01:12:23,649
for a stupid job interview.

667
01:12:27,954 --> 01:12:29,222
I know.

668
01:12:31,257 --> 01:12:33,525
And the worst part is
I didn't even tell them why.

669
01:12:35,694 --> 01:12:38,130
I was too embarrassed
in case I didn't get the job.

670
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:45,037
All that scrambling around..

671
01:12:46,805 --> 01:12:48,241
...all my plans.

672
01:12:51,143 --> 01:12:53,078
What does is matter now?

673
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,847
My wife used to say

674
01:12:57,849 --> 01:13:01,017
"Man plans, God laughs."

675
01:13:02,854 --> 01:13:04,322
Yeah.

676
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:09,361
Sounds like something
my mom would say.

677
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,132
Always talking about God's plan.

678
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:20,872
Sure don't seem
like much of one.

679
01:13:22,807 --> 01:13:23,973
Sure don't.

680
01:13:30,382 --> 01:13:31,613
Bury him deep.

681
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:33,548
Don't just run him
out past that Sycamore Line

682
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:36,386
and kick some dirt
on him. You got it?

683
01:13:36,388 --> 01:13:38,720
- What about the girl?
- You still got her wallet?

684
01:13:38,722 --> 01:13:40,722
Mm-hm.

685
01:13:40,724 --> 01:13:43,458
Alright, I got an idea
how to keep the staties

686
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,893
off our ass,
for the weekend at least.

687
01:13:44,895 --> 01:13:46,830
But we still gotta find her.

688
01:13:48,499 --> 01:13:50,666
Do not talk like that, okay?

689
01:13:50,668 --> 01:13:51,833
Don't worry about it.

690
01:13:51,835 --> 01:13:54,102
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this, okay?

691
01:13:54,104 --> 01:13:56,372
I'm sure that,
uh, Nick is fine.

692
01:13:56,374 --> 01:13:59,375
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation..

693
01:13:59,377 --> 01:14:02,277
Hold on, I... I just, I'm in the
middle of something, alright?

694
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,179
Uh, Jenna, uh..

695
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:05,847
I'm gonna go right now
and take care of this.

696
01:14:05,849 --> 01:14:09,483
I will call you soon as I know
somethin'. I promise. Okay.

697
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:11,753
Bye.

698
01:14:11,755 --> 01:14:13,689
Jesus Christ

699
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:15,657
I do not have time
for your foolishness

700
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:16,692
this morning, Douglas.

701
01:14:16,694 --> 01:14:19,227
My deputy is MIA.

702
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:22,164
His wife's been calling me
non-stop all night.

703
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,866
Between her
and Sawyer Scott's mother

704
01:14:24,868 --> 01:14:26,500
I... I cannot go five minutes

705
01:14:26,502 --> 01:14:28,203
without an hysterical
phone call.

706
01:14:28,205 --> 01:14:31,073
- He been gone long?
- He, uh..

707
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:33,342
He left here
yesterday afternoon

708
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:37,578
nobody's seen him since.
I mean, I... I'm concerned.

709
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:41,383
Well, good news is I'm here
to lighten your workload.

710
01:14:41,385 --> 01:14:42,783
I'm taking over
on that missing girl.

711
01:14:42,785 --> 01:14:45,354
Now, my team's heading up
here now to do a proper search

712
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,425
of those woods up by Rust Creek
all the way through to Blackridge.

713
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:52,827
Okay, well, it's no secret
I don't like that

714
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:54,929
but, uh, I guess
it's for the best.

715
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:56,831
Mm-hm.

716
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:59,767
Got my own missing
person to deal with now.

717
01:14:59,769 --> 01:15:02,403
Okay, well, uh,
you just give me a minute

718
01:15:02,405 --> 01:15:03,971
I'll head out with you,
I'll debrief your men,

719
01:15:03,973 --> 01:15:05,373
and I'll catch 'em up
on what we know.

720
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,808
Look, that ain't gonna be
necessary. They got the report.

721
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,810
I got this girl's parents
comin' over from Paducah.

722
01:15:09,812 --> 01:15:11,447
I... it's fine, it'll just
be a minute.

723
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:14,614
Just gonna check
Nick's locker here.

724
01:15:14,616 --> 01:15:17,151
See if he took his civvies with
him or if he's still in uniform.

725
01:15:17,153 --> 01:15:19,253
Really, O'Doyle,
we can handle it, alright?

726
01:15:19,255 --> 01:15:21,255
I appreciate the offer.

727
01:15:21,257 --> 01:15:23,725
Oh, what the hell..

728
01:15:26,828 --> 01:15:28,431
Oh, man.

729
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,803
Well, I'll be goddamned.

730
01:15:47,716 --> 01:15:49,517
Though we have not yet
determined the nature

731
01:15:49,519 --> 01:15:50,617
of the relationship

732
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:53,119
we do believe that
Deputy Katz is involved

733
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:54,988
in Scott's disappearance.

734
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,991
His cruiser was found this
morning in Jonesboro County

735
01:15:57,993 --> 01:15:59,859
so it's a good bet
he's fleeing the state.

736
01:15:59,861 --> 01:16:01,828
So, we're going to extend
our search west

737
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,565
<i>until we find this man.</i>

738
01:16:09,704 --> 01:16:11,603
Now what?

739
01:16:13,008 --> 01:16:14,443
That's it.

740
01:16:16,845 --> 01:16:18,610
In 20 minutes,
you'll be an official cook.

741
01:16:18,612 --> 01:16:21,780
- That ain't so hard.
- Ah!

742
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:25,617
You think you can sit still
20 minutes?

743
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:28,188
I don't know.

744
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:29,922
Well, I think I might be

745
01:16:29,924 --> 01:16:32,327
starting to get used
to the quiet country life.

746
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:50,976
Inside.

747
01:16:50,978 --> 01:16:53,247
Stay by the back door.

748
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:57,218
And if there's trouble... run.

749
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:23,310
Hey there, son.

750
01:17:28,014 --> 01:17:30,783
- How's the cook?
- Fine.

751
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:33,320
Hm.

752
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:39,525
Well, I just thought I'd come
up here to check on ya.

753
01:17:39,527 --> 01:17:42,026
And you done it.

754
01:17:42,028 --> 01:17:43,796
That's close enough.

755
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,001
Wh..

756
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:52,305
What, you're giving orders now,
is that it?

757
01:17:54,642 --> 01:17:58,509
I just don't like nobody
disturbing my cook's all.

758
01:17:58,511 --> 01:17:59,979
Huh.

759
01:18:04,517 --> 01:18:08,254
Well, let me
tell you somethin'.

760
01:18:09,622 --> 01:18:11,989
I got a lot
invested in this here.

761
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:15,193
<i>And, uh, if I wanna
go inside and take a look</i>

762
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:17,197
<i>what y'all up to,
I'm gonna do that.</i>

763
01:18:19,532 --> 01:18:20,799
You ain't.

764
01:18:22,435 --> 01:18:24,370
You forget
who you're talking to?

765
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:31,176
<i>I'm the chief,
you're the Indian.</i>

766
01:18:32,445 --> 01:18:35,379
My kitchen..

767
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:36,681
...my rules.

768
01:18:36,683 --> 01:18:38,784
You know, you ain't
the only cook around here.

769
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:47,625
So, why don't you just
set that gun down and make nice?

770
01:18:55,734 --> 01:18:57,901
Don't kid yourself, boy.

771
01:18:57,903 --> 01:19:00,136
I could put two in you
before you could even

772
01:19:00,138 --> 01:19:02,872
get them barrels
up above your waist.

773
01:19:02,874 --> 01:19:06,144
Lucky for me you're standing
next to a drum full of ether.

774
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:13,350
Too dangerous to keep inside.

775
01:19:13,352 --> 01:19:16,622
One spark from, say, some
buckshot hitting the metal..

776
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:20,392
Hm.

777
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,033
Wow.

778
01:19:31,035 --> 01:19:33,836
A Pritchert with some brains.

779
01:19:33,838 --> 01:19:35,607
Lord help us all.

780
01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:39,377
Alright, well..

781
01:19:41,846 --> 01:19:44,616
You just mind you get
this cook done right.

782
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,352
Next time I come up here..

783
01:19:49,587 --> 01:19:51,522
...I'll know where I stand.

784
01:20:34,532 --> 01:20:36,299
Was that your boss?

785
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:41,504
He sounds like an asshole.

786
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:46,541
He's the worst kind
of snake there is.

787
01:20:46,543 --> 01:20:48,311
Don't rattle before he bite.

788
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:57,854
- Doesn't look like much.
- It'll do.

789
01:20:59,155 --> 01:21:01,091
How much more do we need?

790
01:21:02,826 --> 01:21:05,426
Nine, ten more cooks.

791
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:07,228
That's gonna take all day.

792
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,997
Best get to it then.

793
01:21:12,502 --> 01:21:14,235
But if you get asked,
just remember..

794
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:16,604
Escorting a prisoner
for interview. I got it.

795
01:21:16,606 --> 01:21:18,206
Suspect.

796
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:21,208
Escorting a suspect
for interview.

797
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,710
Don't forget to shave.

798
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:23,877
And keep him in the back seat.

799
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,346
How come I gotta sit in back?

800
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,548
On account of when'd you ever
see someone that wasn't police

801
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,716
riding in the front
of a police car?

802
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:29,883
You ain't police.

803
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,219
That's why
he's got the uniform.

804
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,554
Dangit!

805
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:34,988
Now just remember,
don't give them anything

806
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:35,989
until you get the money.

807
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,023
- I won't.
- You..

808
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,425
You count out
all that money, alright?

809
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:39,827
Don't get lazy
and let 'em short you.

810
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:41,328
Why don't you just come
do the thing yourself

811
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:42,396
if you're so damn nervous then,
huh?

812
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,197
'Cause that's what
I got you for.

813
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,166
So don't screw it up. Alright?

814
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:48,803
We got one chance to show
these boys we can compete

815
01:21:48,805 --> 01:21:50,203
with them Mexicans.

816
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,272
Lowell cooks glass twice
as good as any Mexican.

817
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,775
Yeah, well that's the only
reason he ain't in the ground.

818
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:57,778
You know, he pulled
a shotgun on me today?

819
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,979
It's still burnin' me up.

820
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,381
Yeah, he's been
real touchy lately.

821
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,383
Don't even invite us in
for a drink no more.

822
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:07,788
Alright, well, let's do this.

823
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,224
Alright.

824
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,325
I'mma go inside and change.

825
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,095
I'mma go sit in the back.

826
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:18,365
Not very green.

827
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:21,768
Well, if you dump it on the
land, it stains the ground red.

828
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,372
Like having a big meth lab
sign in your front yard.

829
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,843
The creek
washes it clear away.

830
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:31,946
By tomorrow,
you'd never know it was here.

831
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:43,656
So that's it, huh? All done?

832
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:44,760
Yeah.

833
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:53,634
I thought you'd be relieved.

834
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,838
I am.

835
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:01,909
So, once you got me
out of your hair, then what?

836
01:23:06,714 --> 01:23:08,982
I've been thinking
about what your mama said.

837
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:12,485
And about how
cuttin' up matchbooks

838
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,285
is part of making meth.

839
01:23:15,823 --> 01:23:17,288
You doing a lot of thinking.

840
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,426
I guess so.

841
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,730
I got this idea they're kinda
connected, you know?

842
01:23:25,298 --> 01:23:27,234
I don't got it figured out
in my head yet, but..

843
01:23:28,401 --> 01:23:29,837
...it's like..

844
01:23:31,104 --> 01:23:32,872
Like, in our life,
everyone we meet

845
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,474
is a chemical reaction.

846
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,477
They change us
and we change them.

847
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:42,514
'Cause we changed,
we can go on and have different

848
01:23:42,516 --> 01:23:44,249
reactions with other people.

849
01:23:44,251 --> 01:23:46,353
And we don't always know
how it will end up.

850
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:49,420
We don't.

851
01:23:49,422 --> 01:23:50,956
Like the matchbooks,
they don't know

852
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,559
how they're gonna end up.

853
01:23:54,594 --> 01:23:56,530
But just 'cause
we can't see a plan..

854
01:23:59,299 --> 01:24:01,167
...that don't mean
there ain't one.

855
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:08,475
Anyway, it made me feel
a little better about things..

856
01:24:09,843 --> 01:24:11,978
...thinking it all
fit together somehow.

857
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:38,571
Cousin.

858
01:24:43,776 --> 01:24:45,609
It's nice to see you too.

859
01:24:45,611 --> 01:24:47,379
Hi, L-O-L.

860
01:24:50,482 --> 01:24:52,115
Hey.. See, hey, hey!

861
01:24:52,117 --> 01:24:54,219
Ain't you gonna say
nothin' about my duds, huh?

862
01:24:57,022 --> 01:24:58,490
Nice duds.

863
01:25:11,971 --> 01:25:13,939
We'll be back tomorrow
with your cut.

864
01:25:19,078 --> 01:25:21,013
You're welcome.

865
01:25:44,902 --> 01:25:46,170
So that's it?

866
01:25:47,405 --> 01:25:48,840
All clear?

867
01:25:50,341 --> 01:25:52,908
Well, we should probably
lay low for a little bit.

868
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:54,777
I'll go pick up
the truck around noon

869
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:57,214
and drop you off
with the state police.

870
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:01,519
What'll I tell them?

871
01:26:02,453 --> 01:26:04,221
Tell 'em the truth.

872
01:26:05,857 --> 01:26:09,290
I'll be cleared out
of here by dark.

873
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:11,927
You're leavin'?

874
01:26:11,929 --> 01:26:13,363
It's time.

875
01:26:16,934 --> 01:26:18,468
You can only sit still so long.

876
01:26:22,106 --> 01:26:27,145
Besides, there's too many
ghosts in these woods.

877
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:35,153
I guess I can give
this back now.

878
01:26:43,193 --> 01:26:44,294
Keep it.

879
01:26:46,596 --> 01:26:49,831
A conversation piece,
for all the friends

880
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:51,666
you're gonna make in DC.

881
01:26:51,668 --> 01:26:53,735
Yeah, I'm not so
sure that they're gonna..

882
01:26:55,772 --> 01:26:58,640
You old dog.

883
01:26:58,642 --> 01:27:00,375
<i>This explains everything!</i>

884
01:27:00,377 --> 01:27:02,577
Well, you could've
just told me.

885
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:05,814
- He didn't want to share.
- And he shouldn't have to.

886
01:27:05,816 --> 01:27:07,816
So what if we seen her first?

887
01:27:07,818 --> 01:27:10,185
That don't mean nothin' to me

888
01:27:10,187 --> 01:27:12,020
when it comes
to Cousin Lowell's happiness.

889
01:27:12,022 --> 01:27:16,191
N... now, now, now you just,
you just hold on there, Lowell.

890
01:27:16,193 --> 01:27:19,493
You proven to be
pretty untrustworthy lately

891
01:27:19,495 --> 01:27:20,995
<i>and I don't think
we can leave it up to you</i>

892
01:27:20,997 --> 01:27:22,766
to do the right thing here.

893
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,267
So this little lady..

894
01:27:27,269 --> 01:27:29,705
...is just gonna
have to come with us now.

895
01:27:33,509 --> 01:27:34,942
Take a seat, Holli.

896
01:27:34,944 --> 01:27:38,245
We ain't got time to be havin'
this conversation, Lowell.

897
01:27:38,247 --> 01:27:40,015
Make time.

898
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,863
Won't take long.

899
01:28:06,508 --> 01:28:08,842
<i>Sawyer, honey..</i>

900
01:28:08,844 --> 01:28:11,113
...you mind heating me up
a cup of that coffee?

901
01:28:12,313 --> 01:28:13,749
It's okay.

902
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:19,221
Just fetch the coffee.

903
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,369
I swear I should've known.

904
01:28:37,806 --> 01:28:40,475
We been all through
these goddamn woods.

905
01:28:48,283 --> 01:28:49,884
Here's the thing..

906
01:28:52,086 --> 01:28:54,022
<i>...I know what
has to get done.</i>

907
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,060
And I'll take care of it..

908
01:29:01,229 --> 01:29:02,831
...in my time.

909
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:09,936
But for now..

910
01:29:09,938 --> 01:29:12,772
...would you just
let me have some fun?

911
01:29:12,774 --> 01:29:15,709
<i>I mean, you see how trained
I got her, don't you?</i>

912
01:29:47,808 --> 01:29:50,408
That's it, baby.

913
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:53,013
Now, get over here
and sit on my knee.

914
01:30:02,322 --> 01:30:03,454
<i>Goddamn!</i>

915
01:30:03,456 --> 01:30:05,422
<i>You sure do got some things</i>

916
01:30:05,424 --> 01:30:07,558
<i>to teach me, boy.</i>

917
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,227
And the thing is,
if it was up to me...

918
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:11,762
- <i>Holli?</i>
- H... hang on, Buck.

919
01:30:11,764 --> 01:30:12,898
I think there's
something wrong...

920
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,166
Hang on a second,
the thing is though

921
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,700
it ain't just up to me..

922
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:19,472
But, Holli, the microwave..

923
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:04,381
<i>Come on!</i>

924
01:31:07,853 --> 01:31:08,953
Please!

925
01:31:10,089 --> 01:31:11,288
I can't.

926
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:19,332
You remember Bishop's Road?

927
01:31:22,467 --> 01:31:23,467
I can't..

928
01:31:24,636 --> 01:31:26,602
You're gonna be okay.

929
01:31:32,744 --> 01:31:33,744
Run!

930
01:32:22,559 --> 01:32:23,559
Easy now.

931
01:32:26,697 --> 01:32:28,398
Don't do nothin' stupid.

932
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,534
Yous about all the stupid
this family needs.

933
01:32:31,568 --> 01:32:34,036
Why'd you go and do all this?

934
01:32:34,038 --> 01:32:35,337
For some girl?

935
01:32:37,475 --> 01:32:38,542
What does it matter?

936
01:32:41,745 --> 01:32:42,745
It's done.

937
01:32:48,052 --> 01:32:49,052
Sheriff.

938
01:33:18,282 --> 01:33:21,516
<i>Jesus! That fucking Lowell.</i>

939
01:33:22,519 --> 01:33:24,455
She was here
the whole goddamn time.

940
01:33:28,591 --> 01:33:31,560
- Is the meth..
- The cruiser, down the way.

941
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:32,993
Thank God.

942
01:33:32,995 --> 01:33:34,563
<i>That girl run off, O'Doyle.</i>

943
01:33:34,565 --> 01:33:35,796
Through them woods

944
01:33:35,798 --> 01:33:38,099
headed toward Bishop's Road.

945
01:33:38,101 --> 01:33:40,234
I'mma go after her.

946
01:33:40,236 --> 01:33:42,536
- You circle around the road.
- <i>Okay.</i>

947
01:33:42,538 --> 01:33:43,671
And I'll flush her out to you.

948
01:33:43,673 --> 01:33:44,974
Yeah, yeah, that's, uh..

949
01:33:45,975 --> 01:33:47,276
...good thinkin' there.

950
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,513
Don't forget your gun there.

951
01:33:52,515 --> 01:33:53,515
Right.

952
01:33:55,918 --> 01:33:57,251
Fuck!

953
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,426
Go on, pick it up.

954
01:34:09,865 --> 01:34:10,865
Come on, boy.

955
01:34:13,369 --> 01:34:14,369
O'Doyle..

956
01:34:14,936 --> 01:34:16,102
Ah..

957
01:34:16,104 --> 01:34:17,104
You can't.

958
01:34:17,973 --> 01:34:19,342
We're partners.

959
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:21,510
Go ahead.

960
01:34:22,311 --> 01:34:23,311
I won't.

961
01:34:25,247 --> 01:34:28,281
I won't, I won't do it.

962
01:34:28,283 --> 01:34:30,250
You can't shoot me
if I ain't armed.

963
01:34:32,287 --> 01:34:34,954
You think I'm concerned
with the forensics

964
01:34:34,956 --> 01:34:39,227
on a known felon shot outside
a burning meth house?

965
01:34:42,697 --> 01:34:47,402
Son, I just wanted you to feel
like you had a fighting chance.

966
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:04,352
You didn't.

967
01:36:30,671 --> 01:36:33,237
So you're saying..

968
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:36,340
...this Lowell Pritchert guy..

969
01:36:36,342 --> 01:36:37,743
...was holding you?

970
01:36:37,745 --> 01:36:40,278
No, not holding me.
Hiding me.

971
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,513
Oh, okay, from, uh,
from these other fellas

972
01:36:42,515 --> 01:36:43,813
that was after you.

973
01:36:43,815 --> 01:36:44,814
Why aren't you calling this in?

974
01:36:44,816 --> 01:36:46,150
He could still be alive.

975
01:36:46,152 --> 01:36:47,652
Hold on now there, miss.

976
01:36:47,654 --> 01:36:49,220
No sense in callin' anything in

977
01:36:49,222 --> 01:36:50,523
until I get all the facts.

978
01:36:57,297 --> 01:36:59,232
<i>So these other fellas, uh..</i>

979
01:37:00,733 --> 01:37:02,233
...was it just the two of them?

980
01:37:02,235 --> 01:37:03,401
Hmm.

981
01:37:03,403 --> 01:37:05,569
Buck and Hollister.

982
01:37:05,571 --> 01:37:09,039
They all work for somebody else
but I never saw him.

983
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:10,708
Shouldn't you at least
call an ambulance

984
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,510
or back-up or somethin'?

985
01:37:12,512 --> 01:37:13,810
Well, now, here's the deal

986
01:37:13,812 --> 01:37:16,781
you're just gonna have to trust
my way of doin' things

987
01:37:16,783 --> 01:37:18,683
'cause around here..

988
01:37:18,685 --> 01:37:21,251
Well, I'm the chief..

989
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:22,655
...you're the Indian.

990
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:27,392
So, this third guy,
you never saw him?

991
01:37:28,728 --> 01:37:30,028
Did you get a name?

992
01:37:31,798 --> 01:37:32,798
No.

993
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:39,470
A voice?

994
01:37:41,239 --> 01:37:44,607
- Um, what?
- A voice?

995
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,978
Did you hear him?
What his voice sound like?

996
01:37:49,348 --> 01:37:50,449
Oh..

997
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:53,216
I don't know, just..

998
01:37:53,218 --> 01:37:56,586
...just normal,
just a normal voice.

999
01:37:56,588 --> 01:38:00,590
Hmm. So you wouldn't recognize
him if you heard him again.

1000
01:38:00,592 --> 01:38:01,592
No.

1001
01:38:02,728 --> 01:38:04,028
I definitely wouldn't know.

1002
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:22,046
I think we're gonna walk
the rest of the way.

1003
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:46,836
Come on now.

1004
01:39:05,823 --> 01:39:08,091
Just go on down
a little further there..

1005
01:39:09,025 --> 01:39:10,025
...down by the water.

1006
01:39:18,368 --> 01:39:21,402
<i>They call this Rust Creek..</i>

1007
01:39:21,404 --> 01:39:23,673
...because of all the clay
deposits up the hill.

1008
01:39:25,241 --> 01:39:26,844
Turned the water red.

1009
01:39:29,045 --> 01:39:31,815
And they mined up all the clay
before I was born.

1010
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:35,652
That name stuck though.

1011
01:39:49,799 --> 01:39:51,099
Let's go on now.

1012
01:40:14,089 --> 01:40:15,089
Okay.

1013
01:40:17,426 --> 01:40:18,426
Okay.

1014
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:23,031
You don't have to do this.

1015
01:40:25,334 --> 01:40:26,334
Hm.

1016
01:40:29,204 --> 01:40:30,506
In the water.
