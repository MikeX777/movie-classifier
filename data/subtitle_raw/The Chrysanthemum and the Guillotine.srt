Sorry.

182
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,390
You killed a man and got no money!

183
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,940
What's done is done.
Sorry I couldn't join you.

184
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,610
Where's Kurachi?

185
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I bet he ran as usual.

186
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,870
- Again!
- He's all talk!

187
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,670
Tetsu!

188
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,470
It stinks!

189
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,720
- Don't wash your testicles here!
- Lay off, it hurts!

190
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,770
The police!

191
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,100
Run!

192
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,560
Stop!

193
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,560
Stop right there!

194
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,160
Go now!

195
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,160
Are you OK?

196
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,170
But Tetsu...

197
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,420
I know what I'll do!

198
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,170
What?

199
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,930
Something even Shusui Kotoku
couldn't do!

200
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,510
- Kill the Emperor?
- No.

201
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,480
That wouldn't be worth risking
my life for.

202
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,980
The Regent Prince.

203
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,730
Killing him will
unnerve the Emperor.

204
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,650
Come on, our enemy is in Tokyo!

205
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:35,710
The Chrysanthemum and The Guillotine

206
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,470
Kiku.

207
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,220
What's that smell?

208
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,760
Oh, no...!

209
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,100
Add water and no one will know.

210
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,210
Tokachi River!
You could have taken care of it!

211
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:55,660
<i>A recession followed the earthquake.
Refugees left Tokyo to survive.</i>

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,590
{\pos(315,288)}Navy Funabashi Radio Station
(10 km east of Tokyo)

213
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:20,270
<i>Opportunists sold pig feed
and even compost to the refugees.</i>

214
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,360
<i>They were known as "Food scrappers".</i>

215
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,190
Go away!

216
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,110
l know you can't pay!

217
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,870
Come and get it.

218
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,540
Only 2 sen a bowl.

219
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,670
It has fish, it's nutritious.

220
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,610
The authorities are busy
with the disaster now...

221
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,280
Let some male spectators
wrestle your girls!

222
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,200
Or get the girls to show their tits.

223
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,500
Right.

224
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,290
I agreed to sponsor you in these
hard times.

225
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,550
We should work together to make money.

226
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Sir, we'll do our best to
make it worth your while.

227
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,760
Leave it to me.

228
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,980
Well, I guess you know best.

229
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,900
Don Sakata has a point, Boss.

230
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,610
- Shut up.
- Right.

231
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,750
It's tasteless.

232
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,870
Sorry.

233
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,750
You burned it?

234
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,710
You obviously added water.

235
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,010
Go cook some more!

236
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,060
You ate it up like a pig.

237
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,160
Who said that?

238
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,270
Give her a break.

239
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,900
She learned a lesson.

240
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,570
She's right. Get along, girls.

241
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,270
Says he.

242
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,400
In hard times like this
we have to suck it up.

243
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,160
What's that smirk?
You have an attitude!

244
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,980
<Fuck you.>

245
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,790
You fucking with me!

246
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,290
- You hit me!
- Stop it!

247
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,710
Lay off!

248
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Stop them!

249
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,050
Do something.

250
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,090
Yeah.

251
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,970
By the way, we're not showing our tits.

252
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,930
Sumo is our thing, Boss.

253
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,270
I know!

254
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,310
Sanji, hey!

255
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,320
Sanji!

256
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,320
Damn it...

257
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,320
Break it up!

258
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,070
Stop it!

259
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,160

I'll make a new pot, Plum Country.

263
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,550
Teach me, please.

264
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,810
How to be strong like you.

265
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,150
Please teach me,
I promise I'll do my best.

266
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,230
Attention everyone, from the east
to the west.

267
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,030
We're Tamaiwa Troupe, Imperial Japan's
women's sumo!

268
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,570
We're evergreen pine trees as
seasons change.

269
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,990
We appreciate your support
over the generations...

270
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,540
We will remain unchanged!

271
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,810
They wrestle and their tits
wobble around!

272
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,190
Don't their tits get
in the way?

273
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,820
You look like a spook!

274
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,070
Were you a sideshow freak?

275
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,600
His Majesty Emperor issued the
Proclamation to Lift National Morale.

276
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:56,650
His Majesty disapproves of excess and
harmful ideologies!

277
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,240
The socialists corrupt urban
culture and demand freedom.

278
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,160
It caused heavenly imbalance
and the earthquake!

279
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,210
Farmers make the best soldiers.

280
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,510
Imperial Japan will
surpass the West.

281
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:34,520
We must educate Asia's barbarians!
The Chinese, Koreans and the Taiwanese.

282
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,110
We'll make them
His Majesty Emperor's subjects!

283
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,910
We don't have enough enlisted soldiers
to win an inevitable war.

284
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,710
So us veterans will be called
to the battlefield!

285
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,980
You!

286
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,300
What's going on?

287
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,860
What's this?

288
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,550
No more vigilantes!

289
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Veterans must raise funds
and help with disaster relief.

290
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,100
You know about the order!

291
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:20,560
What about the riots that
the Koreans and socialists caused?

292
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,920
Who's giving these orders?

293
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,260
The higher-ups.

294
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,820
We have foreign pressure.

295
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,060
Our national integrity is at stake.

296
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,660
Break up!

297
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,920
- You have no right!
- Control yourself.

298
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,590
You sold out!

299
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,420
What are you saying?

300
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,010
You're a disgrace to the Emperor.

301
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,530
What?

302
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,580
Wait a minute!

303
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,000
Wait!

304
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,900
They're dressed.

305
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,110
Not when they wrestle, I hope.

306
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,250
I hope they'll be naked.

307
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,200
Hey!

308
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,670
They won't be naked, fools!

309
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,250
Absolutely not.

310
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,880
I, Officer Maruman, won't allow such
a perverse show!

311
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,170
Go on.

312
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,840
Move on!

313
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,540
You missed your breakfast, right?

314
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,000
But...

315
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,670
Before someone sees you.

316
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,850
Is your period regular?

317
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,980
No, but...

318
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,230
Abort it.

319
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,820
You don't need the trouble.

320
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,120
What's that for...?

321
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,580
Did my husband send you?

322
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,560
What?

323
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,170
Kiku, the Boss is looking for you!

324
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,020
It's all muddy

325
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,690
but you can eat it.

326
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,490
Kiku!

327
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,870
Wait!

328
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,670
Hey, who is that man?

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,640

00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,110

<i>He watches me and smirks
disapprovingly.</i>

We're taking over this meeting!

338
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,600
Sakae Osugi's famous meeting takeover.

339
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,600

to capitalists.

340
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,350
Follow us and find a new way to work!

You should
t-t-take advantage of this!

00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,460
Practice a new way of living.

347
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,130
That's not all.

348
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,380
You should also think for yourself!

349
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,720
<i>"Look at his face,
he won't live long," I thought.</i>

350

<i>"That's fine with me."</i>

00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,020
<i>"I want to die before I'm 30."</i>

354
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,660
<i>"You know what that means?" he asks.</i>

355
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:49,870
<i>"It means
I've already outlived you."</i>

356
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,420
Listen to me! We're not their slaves!

357
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,340
Act directly!

358
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,760
Direct action by laborers

359
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,680

360
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,280

Observe the power that we have!

363
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,650
Take him away.

364
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,650
Watch me!
This is the power we have!

365
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:36,460
<i>With that daring smirk, he stares
with eyes of deep white.</i>

366
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,210
Tetsu! I couldn't catch
anything for breakfast.

367
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,180
That's how it is sometimes.

368
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,830
Kyu?

369
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,060
{\pos(316,303)}Genjiro Muraki

370
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,030
{\pos(316,298)}Kyutaro Wada

371
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,700
{\pos(321,370)}Kyu.

372
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,870
You sloth!

373
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,880
Sorry to wake you, Gen.

374
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,050
To avenge Osugi, we'll target

375
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,340
the martial law commander Fukuda.

376
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,700
Tanaka, the Minister of Army

377
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,310
and Shoriki, the National Police
Agency's director.

378
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,290
This just wasn't on my mind.

379
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,480
You're too impulsive.

380
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,400
Come on, Old man.

381
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,570
Good morning, Furuta.

382
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,030
Hello.

383
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,280
Did you two sleep well?

384
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,830
Yes.

385
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,710
Wada.

386
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,630
Yes?

387
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,880
Osugi shouldn't have taken part in
the rice riot in Osaka.

388
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,510
He was targeted because he was
in the papers.

389
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,100
"That's what riots are for!"

390
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,320
"The Bolshevists did nothing
b-b-but watch Osugi in action!"

391
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,570
"Then we ignited it!"

392
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,780
"T-t-t-the nation found us
too menacing to handle!"

393
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,620
Right?

394
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,200
The Bolshevists were arrested.
The time for activism is over.

395
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,000
- That's negative...
- Listen!

396
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,630
The Guillotine Association
plan to kill the Regent Prince.

397
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,550
Are you serious?

398
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,680
Seeing Tokyo's devastation,
I thought...

399
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,980
Nature can be destructive
but it didn't destroy civilization.

400
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,150
Only people can upturn it.

401
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,500
Kyu and Gen. I know you want
to avenge Osugi's murder.

402
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,130
Help us achieve our objective.

403
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:31,880
- Do you realize what's at stake?
- At stake?

404
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,620
- Terrorists kill!
- I know!

405
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,240
I'm not finished.

406
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,250
You never decide, it's boring.

407
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,060
The women's sumo troupe is in town...

408
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:46,800
Let's go.

409
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,690
- You can t!
- Why not?

410
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,490
Because...it's sumo
and they'll be naked.

411
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,660
That's why we'll go, genius!

412
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:15,800
<i>You ask me to quit sumo
But how could I?</i>

413
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:31,440
<i>Sumo is like the most
dashing man in the world</i>

414
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,270
Look at this!

415
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,130
Dai, come on!

416
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,800
<i>Imperial Japan's Women's sumo!</i>
How's that?

417
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,260
Go, Plum Country!

418
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,060
Amazing!

419
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,110
Strip off!

420
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,680
Attention please!

421
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,660
Imperial Japan Certified!
Women's sumo!

422
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:15,670
Let's hear it for our wrestlers,
ladies and gentlemen!

423
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:41,950
Out of the East corner is
Mogami River!

424
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,250
Out of the West corner is
Little Cherry!

425
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,120
They'll strip off...

426
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,290
They're both tiny...

427
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:02,030
What! They're not getting naked?

428
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,580
Go, Cherry!

429
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,240
Destroy all enemies!

430
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:45,430
Go!

431
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,650
That's good!

432
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,860
Cherry, hold on!

433
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,500
Amazing!

434
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,120
Cherry won!

435
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,600
Tokachi River!

436
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,210
Go, Tokachi!

437
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,110
Tokachi!

438
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,610
Look at me!

439
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,570
Look at me.

440
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,660
You're the best, Tokachi.

441
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,740
So good!

442
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,590
Beat her!

443
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,810
Go, Brocade Waka!

444
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,830
Go, Mount Hideri!

445
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,340
My girl won!

446
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,340
Waka, Japan's best!

447
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,340
You did well, Mount Hideri!

448
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,540
Brocade Waka won!

449
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,220
Fun spoilers...

450
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,880
Out of the East corner,
Tiger Katsu!

451
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,350
Kyu and Gen, you might have
been tailed.

452
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,480
Maybe so...

453
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,330
but we lost them.

454
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,820
Yona the spook!

455
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,690
Did you go to Ryukyu?

456
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,820
Yes, it was a propaganda tour to
recruit activists. It was fun.

457
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,080
You planned to kill Hara

458
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,890
so Kyu went to Ryukyu and Osugi
to an entomology lab in Gifu.

459
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,960
To avoid being named as suspects.

460
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,510
Nakaoka killed
the Prime Minister, not us.

461
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:47,560
Tiger Katsu!

462
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,020
Wonderful!

463
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,300
Go back to Ryukyu!

464
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,800
The Emperor's Tokyo is in ruins

465
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,560
and you shamelessly watch
women's sumo!

466
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,540
Shame on you!

467
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,240
We came to offer solace
to the refugees.

468
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,740
We have the legitimate patronage of
Mr. Kantaro Sakata.

469
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,520
Sir.

470
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,610
With his encouragement

471
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,110
we decided to hold a 10-day
tournament here.

472
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,300
You beard him, Chairman.

473
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,180
He's a veteran. Stay low.

474
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,530
Sanji.

475
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:34,360
Out of the East corner, Kiku!

476
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,660
Out of the West corner,
Camellia Tama!

477
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,000
Beat her!

478
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,370
Go, Kiku!

479
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,980
Give us an upset!

480
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,920
Tama won!

481
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,870
Out of the East corner,
Plum Country!

482
00:49:53,710 --> 00:50:00,010
Out of the West corner,
Haguro Cherry!

483
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,580
Listen up!

484
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:19,610
One sign of anything immoral,
I'll shut down this promotion!

485
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,220
Mark my words.

486
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,070
Understood?

487
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,180
- Plum Country won!
- Number one!

488
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,620
I had a great time.

489
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,440
Too bad no one was naked.

490
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,660
Somewhere, friends we've never met
are fighting.

491
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,870
It's good to know.

492
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,530
That's slick.

493
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,870
We've decided on a target.

494
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:42,420
General Fukuda, the
martial law commander.

495
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,050
- We'll join you.
- Now you're talking!

496
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,380
Then...

497
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:48,780
What?

498
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,380
Ready money.

499
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,970
Are you robbing us, Tetsu?

500
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,220
Certainly not!

501
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,770
You're the man!

502
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,610
...With little money.

503
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,520
That's all I have.

504
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,610
We'll wait for our chance.

505
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,700
You know your way back.

506
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,530
Take care of yourself, Gen.

507
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,000
I'm not that frail.

508
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,250
Listen, Furuta.

509
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,970
Whatever you do,
don't waste your life.

510
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,150
Long live anarchy!

511
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:51,820
Hurrah!

512
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,510
Hurrah!

513
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,420
Wanna help us?

514
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,670
Hey, wait!

515
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,590
She's so stuck-up!

516
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,270
Sorry about lunch...

517
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,360
Was the Boss upset?

518
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,620
No. It tasted good.

519
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,670
One day you'll have a gingko-leaf knot.

520
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,550
Like a champion? I hope so.

521
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,520
What did you two talk about?

522
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,240
Watch out for Cherry.

523
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,660
That's right.
She has a thing for women.

524
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,930
Huh?

525
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,080
Watch out.

526
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,750
What's this?

527
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,970
Tokachi. Oh, Tokachi...

528
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:49,440
If you want, you can move
into my place.

529
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,860
Come on, why not?

530
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:58,530
Look.

531
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,410
Look.

532
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,250
OK?

533
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,510
Tokachi.

534
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,010
Who are you?

535
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,850
Help!

536
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:23,990
<i>Siberian Intervention veterans got
a medal of honor and pensions.</i>

537
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,330
<i>Within a year
many of them had committed crimes</i>

538
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,920
<i>and the honor was revoked.</i>

539
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,720
Where have you been?

540
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,060
How about working for a change?

541
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,240
Hatsu.

542
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,860
See if Mom's OK.

543
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,840
Hello!

544
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,600
The sumo wrestlers.

545
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,760
- But sirs...
- Are they here?

546
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,690
- Tetsu!
- Don't worry.

547
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,360
Sorry, wrong room!

548
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,010
Sorry.

549
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,620
Wrestlers!

550
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,910
The wrestlers are here but...

551
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,120
- Thanks.
- Wait!

552
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,870
Hi, there!

553
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,420
Who are you?

554
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:02,210
- They let themselves in...
- I'm Suzuki, a novelist.

555
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,470
I'm working on a novel
at my second house.

556
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,050
He's my assistant.

557
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:13,230
The sumo wrestlers impressed me
so much today.

558
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,270
They are a symbol of today's women!

559
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,770
I want to write about them.

560
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,940
I'd love to interview them.

561
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,860
I see.

562
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:28,240
In particular Tokachi River
and Kiku.

563
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,790
So we'll join you tonight
if you don't mind.

564
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:42,380
We don't even allow
fans to meet our girls.

565
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:43,880
How about them?

566
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,840
They're sponsors.

567
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,100
Oh, come on! I'll sit here.

568
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,430
No you won't, sir.

569
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,430
I'm not moving.

570
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,690
I'm gone!

571
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,490
Forget about them, Chairman.

572
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,450
Have a drink.

573
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:13,950
Pardon me.

574
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:21,250
My fellas worked with you veterans
as vigilantes, remember?

575
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,180
But my boys are all idiots so

576
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:35,100
they harassed anyone
they thought was Korean.

577
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:40,850
I guess some were Koreans but
many were just country folk.

578
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:47,530
They killed them anyway
and were jailed.

579
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,540
None of you got jailed?

580
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:56,750
Tetsu.

581
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,790
You hear that?

582
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:05,750
Imperial Army soldiers
aren't so foolish!

583
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,140
Hey, come on!

584
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,240
Wait!

585
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,690
Why are you so upset?

586
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,820
Drink up and forget it!

587
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,660
It was a miserable show today.

588
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:40,000
It was just a bunch of guys
out to seduce you.

589
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,500
Really.

590
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,170
Your pussy is your attraction,
not sumo.

591
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,930
Say that again!

592
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,010
Sure!

593
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,930
Stop acting like a hooker.

594
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,600
Stop it!

595
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,350
Let go!

596
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,110
Everyone knows

597
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,360
that you turn tricks
wherever we go.

598
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,360
You don't know what it's like!

599
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:17,870
Katsu!

600
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,040
Lay off, you two!

601
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,000
Katsu!

602
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,180
You thief!

603
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:37,350
It's mine!

604
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,430
It's mine!

605
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,560
What's wrong with me
making use of my body?

606
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,530
Sumo is the same thing!

607
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,780
You think you're special?

608
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,280
This money...

609
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,280
Come on, everybody pick it up!

610
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,540
Pick it up!

611
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,370
We share profits.

612
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,380
That's enough!

613
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,460
Katsu!

614
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,550
You're my niece but this is too much.

615
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,300
We all have our troubles!

616
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:23,100
Don't take your frustration
out on others!

617
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,490
It's mine!

618
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:36,530
It's mine!

619
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,950
No one can have it except me!

620
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,910
It's mine!

621
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:56,630
Stop acting like a dad.

622
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,350
Katsu?

623
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,940
What happened?

624
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,650
Get off me!

625
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:21,830
Tokachi must be Korean...

626
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:30,380
The Korean miners in my
neighborhood spoke like her.

627
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,220
You heard her, Cherry?

628
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,390
I don't care

629
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,970
if she's Korean or not.

630
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,560
You don't?

631
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,630
Tetsu.

632
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,050
Huh?

633
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,180
We need bombs.

634
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,600
With explosives, we can't fail.

635
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,820
Guns are no good. We need bombs.

636
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,320
I guess so...

637
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:51,960
Are you thinking about
those sumo women?

638
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,420
We were tailed.

639
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,470
Ouch!

640
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,350
That's not the welcome I hoped for!

641
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,730
Tokachi?

642
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,980
- Are you OK?
- Tokachi!

643
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,980
Did it hurt?

644
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:19,590
I'm fine.

645
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:27,870
So this is the second house
of a novelist!

646
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:38,590
You said you wanted to interview me.

647
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,340
I was bored with my
slow-witted assistant.

648
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:34,100
The moon's beautiful.
We could drink outside.

649
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:41,980
Great idea! Very stylish.

650
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,530
It's cold.

651
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:56,000
- Stay here.
- What?

652
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:06,670
All men like Tokachi.

653
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,190
It's invigorating...

654
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,150
What is?

655
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:32,620
I'm from a fishing village
so the ocean affects me...

656
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,800
It's by Genkai Sea.

657
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,880
Heard of it?

658
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,680
I crossed it from Korea.

659
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,520
Sorry.

660
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,910
I came to Japan on my own.

661
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,330
The Japanese back home treated us bad.

662
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:24,090
I thought that I'd be better
off here.

663
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,510
I was wrong.

664
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,690
I was a hooker in the
red-light district in Asakusa.

665
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,400
I feel dirty.

666
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,950
You aren't dirty.

667
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,670
The earthquake hit

668
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:19,930
and I managed to survive
but then I was mobbed.

669
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:32,860
They made me sing the national anthem
and say difficult words

670
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,280
like <i>15 yen</i> and <i>50 sen.</i>

671
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,290
They thought Koreans would revolt.

672
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:52,170
They gathered us up on the other side
of Ara river.

673
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,590
At around 10 at night

674
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:05,730
vigilantes, fire brigade members and
schoolkids body searched us.

675
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,730
After the body search

676
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,450
they made us line up.

677
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:27,080
They tied us up so we couldn't move.

678
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,090
They said to wait.

679
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:35,130
"Move an inch and you're dead."

680
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,060
Around midnight...

681
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:50,150
I heard gunshots from the other side
of the river.

682
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:57,450
I heard a boy scream, "Mom!"

683
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,780
And then...

684
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,170
At daybreak...

685
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:17,630
The vigilantes started to...

686
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:22,140
chop off the Koreans' heads.

687
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:28,060
I was so scared...

688
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:34,530
I wasn't ready to die.

689
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,580
I broke free and ran.

690
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:52,960
When I got to the foot of the bridge
I noticed

691
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:00,720
I was treading on bodies.

692
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:07,520
The Koreans' bodies were
strewn all over.

693
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:14,610
Damn it!

694
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,570
Why...?

695
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:28,000
I didn't do it but I apologize!

696
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,920
I'm sincerely sorry!

697
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:00,740
Goddamn it!

698
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:09,180
Damn you!

699
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,060
Damn you!

700
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:24,680
Damn... One more bout.

701
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:36,770
You won!

702
01:14:55,170 --> 01:15:01,210
When I first saw women wrestle
I couldn't believe it!

703
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,760
How could women be so strong?

704
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,100
I thought maybe I could
be strong, too.

705
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:14,810
Why did you want that?

706
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:22,110
Farmers aren't happy when
their babies are girls.

707
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:27,450
Some girls were sent
to work at a textile mill.

708
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:31,990
They might die from tuberculosis at
the mill

709
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:35,410
or leave the mill to be saloon girls.

710
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,710
My sister died, leaving behind a
husband and a baby.

711
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,220
I had to replace her.

712
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,810
I thought it wouldn't be so bad
but I was wrong.

713
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,020
So you ran away.

714
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,570
Things change when you're strong.

715
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:15,870
The poor can get rich.

716
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:20,750
And the weak
could become healthy.

717
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:27,090
The dead might have lived
if they were strong.

718
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:34,310
We could live instead of being
resigned to misery.

719
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:43,360
That's what it means for women
to be as strong as men.

720
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:49,110
The weak can't change anything.

721
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,200
I want to win.

722
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,130
Against who?

723
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,170
Let me see...

724
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,800
Those who've looked down on me.

725
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:17,270
That's silly.

726
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,490
Tussle me one more time.

727
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,920
What was that?

728
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,470
Show me that technique!

729
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,760
It wasn't intentional...

730
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:55,010
It's <i>uchimuso</i>!

731
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,850
It's cold!

732
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,900
You won't become <i>Champion</i>!

733
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:07,570
- Women can only be <i>Ozeki</i>.
- Not the Champion?

734
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:09,650
We leave that to men.

735
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:14,450
Tell Ichiko Kamichika.
She'll yell "Liberate women!"

736
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:18,040
You'll catch a cold!

737
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,130
Go, beat him!

738
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,290
Me?

739
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:42,940
<i>Look at Mount Fuji</i>

740
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,440
We're women's sumo.

741
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:53,200
<i>Covered with white snow</i>

742
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,120
Come see women's sumo.

743
01:18:56,470 --> 01:19:04,730
<i>Melting in the morning light</i>

744
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:21,870
<i>Like a man's passion
melts the heart of a maiden</i>

745
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,160
The women's sumo is here.

746
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,160
Say it louder!

747
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:48,460
Women's sumo for the proletariats!
Come see women's sumo!

748
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,710
More cheerfully!

749
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,070
We fight with the working class!

750
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,590
Please come.

751
01:19:55,510 --> 01:20:00,510
We have a full house every day.
Don't miss us!

752
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,760
"Come to Tamaiwa Women's Sumo!"

753
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:39,050
We fight with the working class!

754
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,840
Come see us!

755
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,930
Come on! Pick up these fliers!

756
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,480
Hold on!

757
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:02,830
- Thanks.
- Keep it up.

758
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:13,710
Come to women's sumo.

759
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,890
Women's sumo fights with proletariats!

760
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,060
Women's sumo for the working class!

761
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,980
Come and see women's sumo!

762
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:14,360
Come eat my fish!

763
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,360
I caught them!

764
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:40,440
<i>Beneath Paris, City of Lights</i>

765
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:46,330
<i>Blood-red flowers
bloom in a dark corner</i>

766
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:52,290
<i>In the murk of crime and punishment</i>

767
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:58,360
<i>Evil flowers bloom</i>

768
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:04,180
<i>The dark and cold sewer is their home</i>

769
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:10,040
<i>Where the Apaches grew up
is always wet</i>

770
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:16,080
<i>So deep underground that no light
would reach</i>

771
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:21,960
<i>Where the rogue Apaches were born
and lived</i>

772
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:25,030
I have a dream.

773
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:27,530
I have a dream!

774
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:31,040
I'll build a new country in Manchuria.

775
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,890
Everyone's equal.

776
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,770
Everyone has a job.
No one's rich or poor.

777
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,150
An equal paradise!

778
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,820
Is it possible?

779
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:44,190
Yes.

780
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:46,390
I'll go!

781
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:57,230
Tetsu Nakahama and Tokachi River

782
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,910
You can love anyone you want.

783
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,390
Be selfish.

784
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,370
Be crazy!

785
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,490
Dance!

786
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,410
Dance, Katsu!

787
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,660
Go, Katsu!

788
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:10,280
Never been in the sea?

789
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,730
It's my first time.

790
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,640
Which one's Little Cherry?

791
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:43,840
Haru Oishi from Honjo, Tokyo.
Is that you?

792
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,020
Take her away.

793
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,530
What's going on?

794
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:51,570
Her husband reported her as missing.

795
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,330
I need to ask you questions, too.

796
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,660
Sanji.

797
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:04,000
Take care of the afternoon show.

798
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,230
OK.

799
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,030
Cherry!

800
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,850
Has it been a year that she's
been with us?

801
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,610
You owe your husband an apology.

802
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,900
Are you listening?

803
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,860
I will not apologize to anyone.

804
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:37,030
- I should've burned down the house!
- What?

805
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:38,640
You traitor!

806
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,210
Let her get up!

807
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:46,130
Get up, traitor!

808
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,880
I'm happy to be one!

809
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:54,550
Since I have no hope,
I'll do what I please!

810
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,600
Come on! Shut up!

811
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,660
Cherry!

812
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:03,370
Don't let them beat you!

813
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,300
Get up!

814
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:20,910
Cherry! Don't let them beat you!

815
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:26,860
Cherry, stay strong!

816
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,180
The men with the sumo women
are socialists!

817
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:38,510
There was a Korean wrestler.

818
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,560
The riot never happened!

819
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,770
Listen, Maruman!

820
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:48,150
Don't be pushy, veteran!

821
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,440
The killing of the Koreans...

822
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:58,620
You just followed the orders, OK?
Remember that!

823
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,120
I have an issue with the sumo women...

824
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,960
What's that?

825
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,170
None of your business.

826
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:13,590
I'm busy!

827
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,010
Give me water.

828
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,660
Give me more.

829
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,960
I remember him.

830
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,150
You made me jump.

831
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,360
What is it?

832
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:16,230
Remember the man with the police chief
at the inn?

833
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,840
The bald man?

834
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:22,660
He's Matsutaro Shoriki.

835
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,290
From the Police Agency?

836
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:30,960
He started the rumor about
the Koreans' and socialists' riots.

837
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:45,060
I heard the Army Cavalry killed many
Koreans at the internment camp.

838
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:49,640
I guess Shoriki was reassigned
as part of a cover up.

839
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:57,150
Tetsu, leave that.

840
01:29:58,470 --> 01:29:59,760
Watch this. Let's go!

841
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,450
- Where to?
- Come on!

842
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:23,530
Wait!

843
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,680
Come on, Dai.

844
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:28,930
Dai.

845
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,600
Shoriki is insignificant!

846
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:39,230
- I'll kill him by myself.
- Gen said to get Fukuda!

847
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:41,570
You don't really care.

848
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,860
You're aimless.

849
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:46,950
<i>Guillotine</i>? It's a game for you!

850
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:49,080
Because I'm a poet!

851
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:55,670
Were you really going to learn how
to fly and go to Manchuria?

852
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:58,710
Regular folks won't understand me!

853
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,220
Hey, wait a minute.

854
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:08,260
Come on, listen to me.

855
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:25,700
Yunoshin would be free if you
hadn't made him do it!

856
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:29,030
He volunteered. You were there.

857
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,410
He operates as a free agent.

858
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:37,520
You're all talk and that won't change.

859
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,920
I killed a man.

860
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:46,130
I'll go to hell by myself.

861
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:52,100
Bastard!

862
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,710
You cocky virgin.

863
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:03,840
I fed you all these years!

864
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:06,110
Go screw a girl.

865
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:10,830
For once, give your testicles
some relief.

866
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:14,370
Kiku will be happy
to break you in.

867
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,750
Your brain's addled with syphilis!

868
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:39,650
Hey, you're letting him get away.

869
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,400
Damn...

870
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,950
I'll deal with you later.

871
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:36,660
How will you do it?

872
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,860
I won't need you.

873
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:06,820
Hey!

874
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:17,740
Stay away.

875
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,090
Conductor!

876
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:45,860
Tomorrow may never come.

877
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:48,690
It has to be now.

878
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:51,610
There's no other way!

879
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:56,240
OK. I'll cover for you.

880
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:58,370
Go for it!

881
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:35,470
Come on! Hurry up!

882
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,160
What's going on?

883
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:50,130
What do you want with me?

884
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,880
Stop!

885
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,840
You go around!

886
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,680
Get them!

887
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,700
Hold it there!

888
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:18,990
Let go!

889
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:22,620
Wait!

890
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:26,960
- The show's starting.
- I can't wait.

891
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,710
Please.

892
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,150
Let me go!

893
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,490
You were with the socialist.

894
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:39,680
I'll interrogate you.

895
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,620
You're not the police!

896
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,210
They approve.

897
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:49,480
The police left her alone though!

898
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:51,270
Don't interfere!

899
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,610
Let's stay out of it.

900
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,490
Sanji!

901
01:36:57,610 --> 01:37:00,780
The Boss left you in charge!

902
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,910
It's showtime.

903
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,120
The audience is waiting.

904
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,960
I want to get you girls back next year.

905
01:37:11,290 --> 01:37:14,920
Despite these hard times,
I invited you here.

906
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,590
You're so kind to us, Mr. Sakata.

907
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:26,310
He'll soon release you.

908
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,350
You've done nothing.

909
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,000
OK, then.

910
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,070
Tokachi.

911
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,410
Come back soon.

912
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,630
Let's work!

913
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:00,220
Okay?

914
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:02,640
Guys!

915
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:52,730
Speak!

916
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:02,030
What horrible schemes do you
Koreans have?

917
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,660
<Screw you!>

918
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:32,230
I know you Koreans are arsonists!

919
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,650
You wish we all burned to death

920
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:39,940
so you start fires and poison
our wells.

921
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,150
You did!

922
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:44,490
No...

923
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:54,500
Then prove it.

924
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,590
Say "Long live the Emperor."

925
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:08,220
Japan belongs to the <i>Emperor, the</i>
<i>Living God</i> and even you're his child.

926
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,930
Say it!

927
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:22,110
Long live His Majesty!

928
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:25,780
Long live His Majesty!

929
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Do it.

930
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,030
Let me go!

931
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,370
Why didn't you let me kill him?

932
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,560
Tetsu! Dai! You have to come with me!

933
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:43,610
What's wrong?

934
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,150
Some military men took Tokachi away.

935
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:52,870
- What?
- She was tied up and beaten...

936
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:56,040
Calm down. Show us where they are.

937
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,330
That way.

938
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,500
Come on!

939
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:06,300
I'm useless...

940
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:12,130
A man like me will never achieve
anything in his life...

941
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:17,560
Idiot!

942
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:22,730
The revolution is second
to saving a woman!

943
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:54,510
<i>Speak!</i>

944
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:05,400
You should go back.

945
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:08,270
Won't you call the police?

946
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,610
No police.

947
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:11,440
It's up to us.

948
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:14,530
- But...
- Listen!

949
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:21,750
Become strong and
change the world, Kiku.

950
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,250
Go now.

951
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:42,810
The veterans are torturing a woman!

952
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:46,310
To the old battery!

953
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:58,160
Stop, you bastards!

954
01:43:58,740 --> 01:43:59,780
Are you okay?

955
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:04,620
They're socialists! Arrest them!

956
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,460
Come on!

957
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,760
You bastard.

958
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,230
You fought in Russia?

959
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,190
You wasted 4 years in Siberia.

960
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:37,860
You fought the Russian revolutionary
army for nothing.

961
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:52,130
We wanted to teach barbarians,
like those Westerners.

962
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:55,380
God sent us on a mission.

963
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:59,930
You were shameless bandits.

964
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:04,350
You were busy giving VD to
the Siberian women!

965
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,600
Hold him down.

966
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:15,480
You think you're smart.

967
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,080
You have no idea

968
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:34,210
what it's like to march through
a blizzard, starving.

969
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:41,930
The hunger stops you
questioning orders.

970
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:45,810
But even that

971
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:52,650
is better than the life of
a starving peasant!

972
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:57,400
You socialists

973
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:00,110
understand nothing!

974
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:04,390
The first time I met Dai...

975
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:09,460
It was at the Peasants Association
in rural Saitama.

976
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:12,370
We tried to get the farmers involved

977
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,050
but for the duration of our stay

978
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:20,840
no farmers came.

979
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:28,180
But even now, I strongly
believe that

980
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,440
it isn't the guy next to you...

981
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,860
who's the enemy.

982
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:40,610
We should fight together!

983
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,200
Hold him up.

984
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,750
I'll behead him.

985
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:53,290
No, don't!

986
01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:57,550
Don't do it!

987
01:46:57,710 --> 01:46:59,630
<i>Aigo!</i>

988
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:04,680
Why did you...?

989
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:08,180
I can still hear it...

990
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:11,520
Those Koreans crying "Aigo!"

991
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:14,440
They begged to be shot.

992
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,650
There was a couple together and we
killed the man...

993
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,440
The woman screamed out, "Aigo!"

994
01:47:22,570 --> 01:47:23,780
Get off me!

995
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:30,660
The Cavalry camped nearby

996
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:34,080
and left the villagers to deal
with the Koreans.

997
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:39,550
In some villages, 3 Koreans were
burned to death.

998
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:45,260
We killed 4 with swords and
buried the bodies.

999
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:47,780
- Shut up!
- Let me speak!

1000
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:52,020
The vigilantes made us do it!

1001
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:55,480
They were too scared to do it
themselves.

1002
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:57,560
They just watched.

1003
01:47:57,730 --> 01:48:00,860
Remember what the socialists
said about us!

1004
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,240
They said that we'd drawn
the short straw.

1005
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,780
For a meaningless war!

1006
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,540
They're wrong...

1007
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,340
They're wrong!

1008
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,630
Take this.

1009
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:32,390
Swing this sword and
chop off the socialist's head!

1010
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:56,750
They don't do anything productive.
They just bark.

1011
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:03,030
Come on, do it!

1012
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:36,410
His Majesty...

1013
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,210
His Majesty...

1014
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,220
May he live long!

1015
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:01,520
Long live, His Majesty!

1016
01:50:01,650 --> 01:50:06,340
Long live, His Majesty!

1017
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:11,680
Long live, His Majesty!

1018
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:24,170
Long live, His Majesty!

1019
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:29,800
Long live, His Majesty!

1020
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:34,390
Long live, His Majesty!

1021
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:38,430
Long live, His Majesty!

1022
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:20,100
Out of the West corner,
Tiny Dragon!

1023
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,000
Out of the East...

1024
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:37,160
Kiku!

1025
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,980
I'm here!

1026
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:49,840
There's Kiku!

1027
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:32,530
It's time.

1028
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:42,080
Ready...fight!

1029
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:06,890
East wins!

1030
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:09,810
She won by <i>uchimuso</i>!

1031
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,090
It's uchimuso!

1032
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:15,710
The technique?

1033
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:18,260
- Kiku!
- Way to go!

1034
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:21,010
Great!

1035
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:26,250
Kiku won!

1036
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,980
That was amazing!

1037
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:31,230
That was good.

1038
01:53:52,150 --> 01:53:53,840
Where's Tokachi?

1039
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:56,530
And where are the others?

1040
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:59,300
We can't find them.

1041
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:12,480
You almost became murderers!

1042
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:31,080
Hey! Over here!

1043
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:40,590
I won!

1044
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,700
I finally won!

1045
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:49,370
Long live Kiku!

1046
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:54,190
Long live Japan's working class!

1047
01:54:54,310 --> 01:54:56,860
Long live revolutionaries!

1048
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:22,610
Why?

1049
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:26,550
Why did you leave me out?

1050
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:44,340
Ouch...

1051
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,820

Tumen River, Korea

<Almost there.>

1059
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:44,880
What?

1060
01:59:45,230 --> 01:59:46,610
<The money!>

1061
01:59:47,230 --> 01:59:49,230
OK, show her the money.

1062
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:59,160
You understand <i>bombs</i>? You sure
the guerrillas will sell us some?

1063
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:04,410
That's the 1,000 yen they asked for.

1064
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:10,300
<Japanese soldiers!>

1065
02:00:40,330 --> 02:00:44,250
Oh no, she conned us!

What?

She said the <i>Heroic Corps</i> were allies!

1068

For Koreans...

1069
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:57,760
all Japanese are bad.

1070
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:00,260
I don't believe that!

1071
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:13,400
We can only get explosives
here in Korea.

1072
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:17,150
How? We're broke now.

1073
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:23,120

Act of 1924 on July 1.</i>

1097
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:11,790
<i>With this the world began excluding
the Japanese.</i>

1098
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:12,850
Thrust!

1099
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:15,350
Thrust!

1100
02:04:19,090 --> 02:04:21,630
Focus! Again!

1101
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:28,890
Ready!

1102
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:30,660
Thrust!

1103
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:36,560
<i>This is when Japan began its
military expansionism.</i>

1104
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:46,450
<i>A year after the earthquake
there was a record-breaking drought.</i>

1105
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:54,330
<i>The concerned farmers asked
the women's sumo to visit.</i>

1106
02:04:55,790 --> 02:05:02,280
<i>They hoped it would anger the Gods
and bring on the rain.</i>

1107
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,780
Welcome!

1108
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:29,930
Mr. Tanaka.

1109
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:32,990
You must be tired.
I'm your sponsor.

1110
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:35,390
I'm Iwaki, the Boss.

1111
02:05:35,890 --> 02:05:39,190
Come inside when you're done.

1112
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:12,660
Shut up and eat!

1113
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:19,210
They certainly eat with gusto.

1114
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:22,040
Their bodies need it.

1115
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:26,190
I'm in awe of them!

1116
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:28,460
More!

1117
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:30,220
Give me more!

1118
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:31,300
More!

1119
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:33,010
Hold on.

1120
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:34,450
Wait.

1121
02:06:34,810 --> 02:06:35,930
I said more!

1122
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:38,890
- Wait!
- What's wrong?

1123
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:47,940
Everyone, we're very sorry.

1124
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:51,490
What? I'm far from being full!

1125
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,490
That's all for today.

1126
02:06:57,620 --> 02:07:00,460
I'll make sure you have
plenty tomorrow.

1127
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:02,670
I'm sorry.

1128
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:24,650
The sponsor is penny-pinching.

1129
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:33,700
I'm hungry...

1130
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:36,450
There's a wise saying about that.

1131
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,710
What's that mean?

1132
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:48,000
<i>Any food on a empty stomach
tastes good.</i>

1133
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:50,420
Right, if there's food...

1134
02:07:51,090 --> 02:07:53,260
At least we get to wrestle.

1135
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:59,010
Isn't the sponsor a landlord?

1136
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:02,520
Not like us peasants.

1137
02:08:03,390 --> 02:08:06,600
I don't know. Ask the Boss.

1138
02:08:06,730 --> 02:08:09,270
He's a bit of a buffoon, isn't he?

1139
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:16,990
You say strange things,
like your predecessor.

1140
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:19,410
You mean, the first Cherry?

1141
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:26,750
That's right.
Cherry the First was a strange woman.

1142
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:36,840
This should be enough.

1143
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,890
Tokachi River...

1144
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:52,070
I wonder what happened to her.

1145
02:08:55,070 --> 02:08:58,030
She was a bit of a wanderer.

1146
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:04,410
Right. She disappeared when we
were last here.

1147
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:10,590
Did Kiku join us a year ago?
No wonder I feel old.

1148
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:14,050
You'll soon have wrinkles
and white hair.

1149
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:16,260
You don't!

1150
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:20,050
I don't know. Like my mother
used to say

1151
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:23,970
when you're at school
your life has stages.

1152
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:28,100
In real life,
you work your ass off

1153
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:30,810
and there are no stages.

1154
02:09:31,190 --> 02:09:36,740
10 years pass. And before you
even realize 20 years pass!

1155
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:41,620
Time sure flies.

1156
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:47,250
That saying is painful to hear
at my age.

1157
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:50,830
Everyone ages and that includes
you lot!

1158
02:11:34,770 --> 02:11:35,610
<i>Sanji...</i>

1159
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:50,830
Boss.

1160
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,040
The police!

1161
02:12:01,210 --> 02:12:02,340
Hello.

1162
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:08,260
This is not sleazy, its not even
entertainment really...

1163
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:12,520
The drought has impacted rice
production

1164
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:15,190
so it's like a rain dance.

1165
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:18,110
You were promoted? Congratulations!

1166
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:20,980
After the Captain resigned.

1167
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:27,530
Most promoters left town because
of the recession.

1168
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:29,910
No one has time for sumo.

1169
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:35,810
If you do anything immoral
to promote your show

1170
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:39,770
we'll shut you down.

1171
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:42,960
I hate police bastards.

1172
02:12:56,270 --> 02:13:00,480
Tiger Katsu and Sanji

1173
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:05,740
If any socialist outlaws turn up,
let us know

1174
02:13:06,660 --> 02:13:08,660
immediately.

1175
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:20,380
Ready.

1176
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:28,450
Not yet.

1177
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:34,830
Go, Plum!

1178
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:38,670
Kiku, beat her!

1179
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:48,130
Ready.

1180
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,450
And fight!

1181
02:14:33,390 --> 02:14:35,560
Go, Kiku!

1182
02:15:04,210 --> 02:15:07,300
Plum Country wins!

1183
02:15:15,370 --> 02:15:17,660
You're much stronger now.

1184
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:19,640
I'm not.

1185
02:15:21,190 --> 02:15:22,670
You are.

1186
02:15:22,870 --> 02:15:24,830
Not enough to change.

1187
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:30,590
Where is Tokachi?

1188
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:34,340
We parted at Shimonoseki.

1189
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:38,470
We asked her to come with us
to Korea.

1190
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:41,930
But she declined.

1191
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,900
That was it.

1192
02:15:49,170 --> 02:15:52,110
She must be waiting in Manchuria.

1193
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:54,070
Huh?

1194
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:58,200
Tokachi loved Tetsu's stories.

1195
02:15:58,930 --> 02:16:01,980
About his new country in Manchuria.

1196
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:08,290
Where everyone's equal and has
a job and food.

1197
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:11,010
No one's rich or poor.

1198
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:16,680
Tokachi often said she wanted to
live there.

1199
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:23,310
Tetsu said it'd be possible
in 100 years.

1200
02:16:25,150 --> 02:16:30,360
Tokachi would wait in Manchuria
for thousands of years for that.

1201
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:34,950
Thousands of years...

1202
02:16:38,660 --> 02:16:42,120
But Tetsu can't go anywhere
for years.

1203
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:44,230
Why?

1204
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:45,980
He's in prison!

1205
02:16:46,650 --> 02:16:48,080
Dai.

1206
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,050
The day's almost over.

1207
02:16:54,930 --> 02:16:56,340
I'm going.

1208
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:04,270
I may never see you again...

1209
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:08,560
Take care.

1210
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:21,280
How arrogant! Is that all you've got?

1211
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:25,000
After all those months and that's it?

1212
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:29,750
Forget stupid Manchuria!

1213
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:32,420
Of course Tokachi isn't waiting.

1214
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:36,170
I bet she's screwing men for money.

1215
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:38,760
- You don't mean...
- I do!

1216
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:42,050
I know now.

1217
02:17:43,470 --> 02:17:45,560
We can't change anything.

1218
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:49,600
The weak remain weak.

1219
02:17:57,030 --> 02:17:58,530
I'll be back.

1220
02:17:59,530 --> 02:18:04,120
I won't wait thousands of years
for you!

1221
02:18:20,220 --> 02:18:25,060
The son of a bitch told me
I was useless.

1222
02:18:25,310 --> 02:18:28,560
So I dared him to be straight with me.

1223
02:18:28,770 --> 02:18:31,850
You know what he told me?

1224
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:33,130
No.

1225
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:37,780
He said,
"Do you think we were equal?"

1226
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:42,780
What kind of bullshit is that?

1227
02:18:42,990 --> 02:18:46,410
Tetsu never makes any sense!

1228
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:50,790
Around here?

1229
02:18:50,890 --> 02:18:51,600
OK.

1230
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:55,730
Put it down.

1231
02:19:44,030 --> 02:19:45,450
No good.

1232
02:20:24,430 --> 02:20:26,030
What are you looking at?

1233
02:20:28,430 --> 02:20:30,470
Don't look at me like that.

1234
02:20:32,810 --> 02:20:35,520
You're always so aloof.

1235
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:43,650
- You act superior...
- I don't!

1236
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:49,070
You think I'm a coward
because I ran.

1237
02:20:49,470 --> 02:20:51,080
No, I don't.

1238
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:55,620
I came back!

1239
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,560
I'm all you have.

1240
02:21:17,480 --> 02:21:19,900
You and your stuck-up face!

1241
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:24,320
You look down on me.

1242
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:28,990
You always have.

1243
02:21:31,410 --> 02:21:36,750
When there were more of us,
not just us two

1244
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:43,670
did you ever talk to me?

1245
02:21:47,470 --> 02:21:50,970
Did you come over and talk to me?

1246
02:21:54,220 --> 02:22:00,350
I talked to you but you just
nodded and gave a phony smile.

1247
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:09,700
Did you care about any of
us back then?

1248
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:17,540
Tell you what.

1249
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:23,500
I don't give a shit what you
think of me.

1250
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:29,420
You'll never understand what a
great person l am.

1251
02:22:34,810 --> 02:22:37,140
Don't act like we're friends!

1252
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:52,990
I knew it.

1253
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,290
The tougher the shell
the greater the explosion.

1254
02:22:57,390 --> 02:22:59,020
Damn it.

1255
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:01,290
I don't know...

1256
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:05,710
Cigarette tins don't hold up...

1257
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:07,780
I'll make one.

1258
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:14,180
I don't know what to do
since Tetsu left me alone!

1259
02:23:29,650 --> 02:23:31,610
Did you say "alone"?

1260
02:23:33,870 --> 02:23:34,870
Hey.

1261
02:23:36,620 --> 02:23:38,620
Did you say "alone"?

1262
02:23:41,290 --> 02:23:44,120
You said you don't know
what to do alone?

1263
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:48,920
Did you say "alone"?

1264
02:23:49,630 --> 02:23:52,340
You ignore me!

1265
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:03,460
I don't ignore anyone!

1266
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:05,850
I never ignore anyone.

1267
02:24:06,590 --> 02:24:08,550
I often think

1268
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:12,920
of that son of a bitch, Tetsu.

1269
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:19,370
What if he was executed?
What if he's dead?

1270
02:24:20,310 --> 02:24:25,460
I think about that.
Sometimes all night long.

1271
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:33,510
Then what happens?

1272
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:37,260
How would I feel?

1273
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:41,310
I'm so sad.

1274
02:24:43,710 --> 02:24:46,440
To lose that son of a bitch.

1275
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:50,190
I'd feel so sad

1276
02:24:52,990 --> 02:24:54,990
if the son of a bitch

1277
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:58,870
was executed.

1278
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:05,770
What about me then?

1279
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:10,570
I killed a man.

1280
02:25:11,590 --> 02:25:13,630
I deserve to be executed!

1281
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:20,760
Don't be silly.

1282
02:25:25,210 --> 02:25:27,750
I'd hate it, Dai.

1283
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:31,650
I'd hate it if you died.

1284
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:49,620
Get the police to stake him out.

1285
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:59,680
Kiku, you have to talk.

1286
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:06,770
Sanji is right. We have to
protect our troupe.

1287
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:09,640
I don't know...

1288
02:26:10,250 --> 02:26:11,420
Why?

1289
02:26:13,110 --> 02:26:16,860
The authorities are stronger now.
Do what they ask.

1290
02:26:16,990 --> 02:26:18,200
No way.

1291
02:26:19,150 --> 02:26:22,820
Times have changed and
so should we, Boss.

1292
02:26:22,970 --> 02:26:24,830
We go against the tide!

1293
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:30,460
Wrestling is popular in American
circuses now.

1294
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:33,380
Sumo is so old fashioned...

1295
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:34,380
You punk!

1296
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:35,460
That hurt!

1297
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:37,300
Sure it hurts!

1298
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:41,720
Break up!

1299
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:43,930
Let him go!

1300
02:26:47,390 --> 02:26:50,140
- Come on!
- I'll get you!

1301
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:56,980
Stop!

1302
02:26:57,150 --> 02:26:58,630
Ugh, damn it!

1303
02:26:59,990 --> 02:27:01,660
That's enough, you two!

1304
02:27:04,490 --> 02:27:08,700
Katsu here is like a daughter to me.

1305
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:15,540
If you want to be with her, say it!

1306
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:19,050
I want her!

1307
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:26,430
This has nothing to do with you!

1308
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:29,180
- Stay out of it!
- Sanji.

1309
02:27:31,390 --> 02:27:33,560
You can leave if you want to.

1310
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:39,480
Hello! Excuse me.

1311
02:27:42,490 --> 02:27:43,240
Yes?

1312
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:47,740
I heard you've been taking
care of my wife.

1313
02:28:11,930 --> 02:28:13,350
Kiku!

1314
02:28:13,730 --> 02:28:15,600
Are you sure?

1315
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:19,860
Come back any time!

1316
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:38,710
Take care, Kiku!

1317
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:20,500
Thank God for his rage.

1318
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,740
What?

1319
02:29:31,890 --> 02:29:32,760
Katsu!

1320
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:36,430
Our sumo troupe is history!

1321
02:29:40,190 --> 02:29:42,610
I have an idea for a new sumo group.

1322
02:29:42,860 --> 02:29:46,780
We won't focus on the win but
on the wrestlers.

1323
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:51,870
We'll give the spectators
stories of the wrestlers.

1324
02:29:52,660 --> 02:29:55,950
And you'll be the star!

1325
02:29:57,460 --> 02:29:59,710
I don't know what you're saying...

1326
02:30:04,130 --> 02:30:09,010
I'll tell the police about
the socialists. The troupe is over.

1327
02:30:09,470 --> 02:30:13,810
What did you say?
I can't hear you!

1328
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:47,300
Don't! Stop that!

1329
02:31:13,870 --> 02:31:16,660
What happened to the baby?

1330
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:22,790
It died in my stomach.

1331
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:48,190
Kiku, where are you going?

1332
02:32:33,610 --> 02:32:40,700
She didn't care about the kid when she
went, she's so selfish...

1333
02:32:42,710 --> 02:32:46,210
Do women have to live for children?

1334
02:32:58,350 --> 02:33:03,180
Get over here!
I bet you learned to drink by now.

1335
02:33:56,570 --> 02:34:00,410
I tell you, her sumo is impressive.

1336
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:08,000
I hope you see my point.
Right, Kiku?

1337
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:31,270
Weren't you ashamed to expose
yourself in public?

1338
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:37,740
Women's sumo is for horny men.

1339
02:34:40,490 --> 02:34:43,660
Even if you were right, so what?

1340
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:53,380
- Where are you going?
- To piss.

1341
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:03,970
You got a little tougher?

1342
02:35:08,230 --> 02:35:09,560
Help!

1343
02:35:42,930 --> 02:35:46,140
That hurt, Tomoyo.

1344
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:32,980
<i>Dear, Dai, I'm still active
though I'm in prison.</i>

1345
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:37,980
<i>I'll publish a poem collection
from here</i>

1346
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:43,820
<i>and call it, "My Nation and Freedom,
Special prison issue."</i>

1347
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:49,410
<i>"Black Bread" written by Tetsu Nakahama</i>

1348
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:54,710
<i>I'm sure you know what
Black Bread means.</i>

1349
02:37:00,210 --> 02:37:03,880
Number 136, lights out!

1350
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:21,360
<i>By the way, about Tokachi River.</i>

1351
02:37:22,030 --> 02:37:24,900
<i>If you ever learned her whereabouts
let me know.</i>

1352
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:03,190
<i>Those who trace my footsteps.
Those who follow me!</i>

1353
02:38:07,030 --> 02:38:10,280
<i>Go beyond international borders!</i>

1354
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:20,750
<i>The time will come!
It will all happen in autumn!</i>

1355
02:38:21,790 --> 02:38:24,550
<i>Then what would happen?</i>

1356
02:38:25,380 --> 02:38:26,630
<i>How silly!</i>

1357
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:30,130
<i>Whatever it will be!</i>

1358
02:38:31,390 --> 02:38:33,300
<i>Whatever it will be!</i>

1359
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:07,300
What did you...?

1360
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,180
What did you do to her?

1361
02:39:18,430 --> 02:39:20,480
It's none of your business.

1362
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:24,190
It is my business.

1363
02:39:29,190 --> 02:39:30,570
Speak up!

1364
02:39:33,390 --> 02:39:36,080
I do what I want to my wife.

1365
02:39:38,250 --> 02:39:43,580
You're horrible... You animal!

1366
02:40:15,930 --> 02:40:18,910
I want to be strong!

1367
02:40:19,830 --> 02:40:22,200
I want to wrestle!

1368
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:38,010
<i>Is it an inevitable fact?
Is it a fact?</i>

1369
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:41,560
<i>Is it servile behavior?</i>

1370
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:45,310
<i>Is it a fact? Or reality?</i>

1371
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:52,150
<i>Social justice! Idealism! Freedom!</i>

1372
02:40:58,910 --> 02:41:02,080
<i>We should all be eaten by the devil!</i>

1373
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:21,140
<i>Know that desperation does
not equal extinction!</i>

1374
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:35,950
<i>In the face of desperation</i>

1375
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:38,860
<i>there is but hope, nothing but hope!</i>

1376
02:41:40,910 --> 02:41:43,910
Give Kiku back.

1377
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:47,540
That's enough. Go away!

1378
02:41:48,690 --> 02:41:52,210
Let her go back to sumo.

1379
02:41:58,970 --> 02:42:03,680
You're book smart but what use is it?

1380
02:42:04,330 --> 02:42:05,960
You can't have her.

1381
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:18,030
I love you!

1382
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:26,200
The revolution is second
to saving a woman!

1383
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:53,020
<i>It's "Thank you, Master" or</i>

1384
02:42:53,440 --> 02:42:59,400
<i>"Damn you, you won't get
away with this!"</i>

1385
02:43:01,070 --> 02:43:02,950
<i>One or the other.</i>

1386
02:43:04,580 --> 02:43:07,660
<i>Nothing else is worthwhile.</i>

1387
02:43:08,710 --> 02:43:12,080
<i>Who cares how humans came to be?</i>

1388
02:43:12,650 --> 02:43:14,150
<i>It's too much!</i>

1389
02:43:23,220 --> 02:43:24,350
Come on.

1390
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:34,520
I don't know...

1391
02:43:36,690 --> 02:43:38,650
what got into me.

1392
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:40,880
What?

1393
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:45,600
I'm...

1394
02:43:47,450 --> 02:43:48,740
going back.

1395
02:43:51,790 --> 02:43:53,000
Katsu!

1396
02:43:54,250 --> 02:43:55,250
Wait!

1397
02:43:55,380 --> 02:43:56,790
Let me go.

1398
02:43:57,340 --> 02:44:01,760
It's obvious I'm not going to
be happy with you.

1399
02:44:01,930 --> 02:44:06,050
Katsu, wait just a minute.

1400
02:44:13,850 --> 02:44:19,780
I've never liked weak men like you!

1401
02:44:27,530 --> 02:44:28,910
Katsu!

1402
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:02,820
You have a mean crotch!

1403
02:45:11,490 --> 02:45:16,500
You can't get to her.
Tomoyo is my woman.

1404
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:23,510
No one owns Kiku, except herself.

1405
02:45:39,400 --> 02:45:40,610
It's a bomb.

1406
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:44,010
Die with me.

1407
02:45:44,150 --> 02:45:45,530
<i>After all</i>

1408
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:51,950
<i>we just wanted to live like humans.</i>

1409
02:45:53,950 --> 02:45:59,120
<i>Can't humans survive without
fighting?</i>

1410
02:46:02,250 --> 02:46:10,010
<i>Maybe we can't survive without
fighting because we are humans!</i>

1411
02:46:28,780 --> 02:46:33,450
Tiger Katsu, you're the star though...

1412
02:46:37,540 --> 02:46:38,870
It's just...

1413
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:43,250
something got into me.

1414
02:46:50,140 --> 02:46:53,550
You say such a thing...

1415
02:46:55,390 --> 02:46:57,640
You shouldn't have.

1416
02:47:18,250 --> 02:47:20,100
It's not my fault.

1417
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:58,270
You're to blame, not me.

1418
02:47:58,830 --> 02:48:02,770
I've done nothing wrong.

1419
02:49:28,460 --> 02:49:29,630
Damn you!

1420
02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:46,560
Where do you think you're going?

1421
02:49:46,850 --> 02:49:51,190
I can't hear you!
My hearing's gone.

1422
02:49:52,860 --> 02:49:54,690
Where are you going?

1423
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:57,450
I'll take him to the doctor.

1424
02:49:58,530 --> 02:50:01,830
But they'll find out who you are!

1425
02:50:01,950 --> 02:50:02,760
What?

1426
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:05,770
They'll find you!

1427
02:50:10,210 --> 02:50:15,630
You're strong, Kiku.
Be the best Ozeki in Japan.

1428
02:50:17,380 --> 02:50:22,010
So you have nothing to fear!
Kiku is fearless.

1429
02:50:22,850 --> 02:50:27,060
I don't know what you're
talking about!

1430
02:50:30,650 --> 02:50:38,780
A truly strong person
never has to take lives.

1431
02:50:40,370 --> 02:50:45,830
Kiku, you're different
to me. You'll be stronger.

1432
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:50,790
No! No!

1433
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:52,290
Don't be a baby.

1434
02:50:54,050 --> 02:50:58,970
You have to take care of yourself.
Who knows when we'll meet.

1435
02:50:59,550 --> 02:51:01,640
Maybe never.

1436
02:51:01,740 --> 02:51:09,120
But I'll think of you
when I'm dying.

1437
02:51:09,310 --> 02:51:10,620
No!

1438
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:14,690
That's not what I want!

1439
02:51:16,780 --> 02:51:20,400
The Chrysanthemum and Guillotine

1440
02:51:33,750 --> 02:51:36,210
Let go of Kiku.

1441
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:42,430
Then I'll take you to the doctor
so you can live.

1442
02:51:43,300 --> 02:51:46,180
Or I'll leave you here to die.

1443
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:02,070
Go! Go back to the sumo troupe.

1444
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:05,280
Tell them he changed his mind.

1445
02:52:16,130 --> 02:52:18,550
Go before we are seen.

1446
02:52:40,510 --> 02:52:41,720
Sir.

1447
02:52:44,320 --> 02:52:47,070
Hey, stop!

1448
02:52:51,580 --> 02:52:52,620
Stop!

1449
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:57,830
Katsu!

1450
02:53:50,510 --> 02:53:52,100
Katsu!

1451
02:53:53,980 --> 02:53:55,520
She collapsed!

1452
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:58,350
Tiger Katsu!

1453
02:54:00,480 --> 02:54:03,780
What happened to you?

1454
02:54:04,610 --> 02:54:06,780
Katsu, why?

1455
02:54:12,740 --> 02:54:13,870
Boss!

1456
02:54:16,250 --> 02:54:19,210
Whatever happened to her?

1457
02:54:37,980 --> 02:54:41,130
She's too stiff to fit in.

1458
02:54:42,980 --> 02:54:44,360
Put her down.

1459
02:55:08,050 --> 02:55:13,600
What the hell are you doing?
Stop it!

1460
02:55:14,930 --> 02:55:16,390
Don't!

1461
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:23,360
Let go! I have to because
she doesn't fit in.

1462
02:55:27,530 --> 02:55:32,360
Remember how she used to be so stiff?

1463
02:55:33,570 --> 02:55:35,870
She could hardly open her legs.

1464
02:55:37,750 --> 02:55:39,330
I'll do the other leg.

1465
02:56:03,850 --> 02:56:05,270
I knew you'd come back.

1466
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:11,150
All wrestlers want to die in the ring.

1467
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:17,950
But it never happens.
We die on the side of the road.

1468
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:22,040
It's always miserable.

1469
02:56:29,860 --> 02:56:31,950
Put her in.

1470
02:56:58,160 --> 02:57:00,830
Don't we all wish to die on the road?

1471
02:57:02,410 --> 02:57:04,310
Dump it at a temple.

1472
02:57:05,670 --> 02:57:08,130
Before the sumo god punishes us.

1473
02:57:25,230 --> 02:57:28,730
It's raining again.

1474
02:57:42,120 --> 02:57:45,960
The Sun God has been upset lately.

1475
02:57:52,170 --> 02:57:53,880
We're shutting you down.

1476
02:57:55,050 --> 02:57:57,880
Sanji testified. We're doing a search.

1477
02:57:58,430 --> 02:58:01,760
Go away! This is no place for
the likes of you!

1478
02:58:02,060 --> 02:58:04,020
Our ring is sacred!

1479
02:58:04,430 --> 02:58:06,180
Stay out!

1480
02:58:11,070 --> 02:58:12,310
Go away!

1481
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:17,700
Go away!

1482
02:59:08,540 --> 02:59:18,920
<i>You ask me to quit sumo
But how could I?</i>

1483
02:59:22,180 --> 02:59:34,400
<i>Sumo is like the most
dashing man in the world</i>

1484
02:59:37,690 --> 02:59:47,790
<i>You get thrown doing sumo
You get dumped by a man for sumo</i>

1485
02:59:48,950 --> 02:59:50,290
Kiku!

1486
02:59:50,790 --> 03:00:03,380
<i>Your parents disowned you
You have no home to go to</i>

1487
03:00:06,010 --> 03:00:16,020
<i>Even if you lost your voice
or got skinny</i>

1488
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:31,160
<i>You'd endure it,
it's all for the glory of sumo</i>

1489
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:39,050
Arrest them all!

1490
03:01:23,340 --> 03:01:24,880
Arrest them!

1491
03:01:31,770 --> 03:01:33,680
Don't resist!

1492
03:01:36,850 --> 03:01:37,640
You bitch!
