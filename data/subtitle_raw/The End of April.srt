3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:19,255
Hi, I called yesterday
to inquire about a room.

4
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:21,356
Yes, the tenth floor of the apartment.

5
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:26,660
I'm in the area. Where are you?

6
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:29,669
What?

7
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,125
When will you be back?

8
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,409
I see. Bye.

9
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,983
Scram!

10
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,618
Follow me.

11
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,926
Is it going to be just you?

12
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,951
Are you a student?

13
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,092
No.

14
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:13,968
I work. I'm also studying for
the civil services exam.

15
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:15,621
Is that right?

16
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,646
Government jobs are the best.

17
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:21,772
They complain that it doesn't
pay much, but that's not true.

18
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:26,530
It's stable and comes with great benefits.
Better than any other jobs, no?

19
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,980
The problem is that it's so hard to be one.

20
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:35,286
My son also studied for the exam.

21
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,405
He wasted three years
and a lot of money, but

22
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:41,633
ended up becoming an aerobics teacher.

23
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,980
What is it?

24
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,588
Nothing.

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,120
Why are you insisting on
that apartment though?

26
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:06,190
Just pay 50 bucks more a month, then you
can get a much better room.

27
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,951
I can't afford it.

28
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:10,331
I just need a place to sleep and study.

29
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:13,016
Alright then.

30
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,972
Most of the units are empty, so
it's going to be pretty quiet.

31
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,948
Is that right?

32
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,006
Yeah, the whole building
is practically empty.

33
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:27,205
The owners decided not to rent their
units until the re-development begins.

34
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:31,891
With all the bizarre things happening, you
can't blame them for acting that way.

35
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:35,172
You'll find out soon enough.

36
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:40,094
People here are not so... how do I say?
Not sophisticated.

37
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:44,706
Oh.

38
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,411
Here's the stamp.

39
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:14,330
Hey guys. Do you live here?

40
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,792
See you later.

41
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:07,407
Wait.

42
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:10,431
You got a minute?

43
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,984
Gosh, it's a girl again.

44
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:18,422
I told them so many times
not to rent it to a girl.

45
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:20,549
Sorry?

46
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:23,438
Keep it quiet, okay?

47
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,170
I can't stand noise.

48
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:33,746
I'm telling you this in advance.

49
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,645
Leave us alone, will you?

50
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:41,555
I hate mingling with neighbors.

51
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,512
Do you know what I'm saying?

52
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:54,345
Yeah.

53
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,723
But...

54
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
We just met.

55
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:03,593
Why are you being so rude?

56
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:09,142
So?

57
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:12,646
Are you offended?

58
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:20,101
We're moving to Seoul soon.
Keep it quiet until then.

59
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,368
My husband works for this big company.

60
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,682
He's going to get a promotion soon
and transfer to Seoul branch.

61
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,506
Oh yeah, I was on my way to a dentist.

62
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:34,650
I spoil her too much.

63
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:38,258
Munching those sweets all
day rotted her teeth.

64
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,954
We'll pull out those disgusting
rotten teeth today.

65
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:40,962
Good morning.

66
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:44,772
Oh, are you from the district office?

67
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:46,187
Yes, I'm Park Hyun-Jin.

68
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,735
Good to meet you. Welcome.

69
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:51,764
Excuse me, everyone.

70
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,896
We have a new member joining you today.

71
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,419
She got promoted to the grade 7
from a district office.

72
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:57,838
What was your name again?

73
00:10:58,445 --> 00:10:59,409
It's Park Hyun-Jin.

74
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:01,801
Please welcome Ms. Park Hyun-Jin.

75
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,387
We used to have three social
service employees, but

76
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,954
one of them is on maternity leave.

77
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:14,280
She had to leave when we're the busiest.

78
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:18,903
Happy to have you, Ms. Park.

79
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:23,412
Let me see. Ms. Ahn?

80
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:26,713
Could you go over the
responsibilities with her real quick?

81
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,641
Living wage, neighbor assistance,

82
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,547
disability, housing, and finally
women and child welfare.

83
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:39,814
Everything's organized here.

84
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,105
Thank you. I'll go over it.

85
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,181
You have to visit the
household twice a week.

86
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,828
I'm sorry it's a lot of work.

87
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:53,770
I bet you'll have to do lots of overtime.

88
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,276
Oh my.

89
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,567
He's back.

90
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,282
He's a disabled person who runs a
little shop in the neighborhood.

91
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:08,917
He's known to bother
any women on sight.

92
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:11,573
You'd better be careful
when you visit him.

93
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,533
I think I'm good now.

94
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:20,628
Let me know if you need any help.

95
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Thank you so much.

96
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,994
Focus, control.

97
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:58,362
Focus, control.

98
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,119
Focus, control.

99
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,776
Focus, control.

100
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,066
Focus, control.

101
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,417
Focus, control.

102
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:37,478
Thank you.

103
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,051
You won't regret.

104
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:46,111
Clean this table, yeah?

105
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,078
Your pantyhose is rolled up.

106
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:04,549
Can't even remember whether you're
wearing a skirt or pants, huh?

107
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,425
Always spacing out.

108
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,804
What do you do after work?

109
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:17,628
You want to go get some chicken
soup out in the outer city?

110
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:23,044
No thanks. I have a plan.

111
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:25,069
With who?

112
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:29,526
No need to lie if you
don't want to go.

113
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:33,989
It's fine. I guess I'll
have to take my wife.

114
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:35,412
Oh yeah.

115
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:41,207
Don't pay the alarm company
unless I tell you to, got it?

116
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:42,818
Fine.

117
00:14:43,385 --> 00:14:44,385
Bye.

118
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,209
Why are you still here?

119
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:31,352
Hey.

What do you want?

122
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:17,000
My neighbor is a bit weird.

123
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:18,963
What do you mean?

124
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:23,785
I don't know what kind of animal they have
at home, but it's making too much noise.

125
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:29,191
I don't think they are the kind
of people you can reason with.

126
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:32,996
I was wondering...

127
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:36,035
if you could talk to them for me.

128
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:40,508
They don't have any pets.

129
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,870
I think you're the one causing trouble.

130
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,130
Your neighbor lady came by earlier.

131
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:50,302
She said you're being way too loud.

132
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:52,005
What?

133
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,479
Why would you bang on their
wall in the middle of night?

134
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:58,663
Also, don't leave your garbage in
front of someone else's door.

135
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:01,632
I didn't take you to be such
an irresponsible person.

136
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,424
For Pete's sake!

137
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,464
My, it looks pretty bad.

138
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:24,497
I told you that you should get
it treated sooner than later.

139
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,502
Let's start. Open your mouth wide.

140
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,626
Wider.

141
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:39,559
Good.

142
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:41,798
Hang in there.

143
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:48,348
When I went to high school,
every girl was chubby.

144
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,429
But nowadays, high school girls are
so tall and thin.

145
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,617
Their bodies mature more quickly, I guess.

146
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:58,935
- Isn't that right?
- Right.

147
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,520
Almost done.

148
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,764
Just a little longer.

149
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:11,466
You're doing super.

150
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,781
Did you process the order from Dongwon?

151
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:27,164
Why on earth didn't you tell me?

152
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:29,975
You completely screwed me.

153
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:32,775
Answer me.

154
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:35,736
Fine.

155
00:21:36,374 --> 00:21:38,963
What's the excuse this time?

156
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:43,165
There's something wrong with you.

157
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,312
Normal people don't make
mistakes like this one.

158
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,139
Did you get a boyfriend?

159
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:53,365
Is he fucking you so much
that you lost your head?

160
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,047
Do you fuck good?

161
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:57,307
Yeah, I bet you do.

162
00:21:57,804 --> 00:21:58,804
Yeah?

163
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:03,112
Get the hell out of here.

164
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:06,138
Don't come back.

165
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:49,693
(Speaking foreign language)

166
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:28,786
Excuse me.

167
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:34,292
I think you dropped this.

168
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:41,268
Hey.

169
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:46,655
Why would you take a pipe wrench with you?

170
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:49,453
It was a gift.

171
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:50,663
What?

172
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,445
Who would give a gift like this to a girl?

173
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:01,321
Sorry, but can I go?

174
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:55,106
Guys.

175
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:59,025
Did you see a piglet that went this way?

176
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:02,273
Do you not know how to speak?

177
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,120
Did you see it or not? Answer me!

178
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,919
Bitch!

179
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:38,218
Can I sleep over at your place tonight?

180
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,565
Sorry, but I have things to do.

181
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,818
No?

182
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:50,595
Fine.

183
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:13,325
Can I pay for this?

184
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:23,483
You little thief!

185
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:27,155
Where did you learn to do that?

186
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,858
Do you go to school to learn how to steal?

187
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:35,524
Let me see your face.

188
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:39,558
I'm taking you to the cops.

189
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:41,234
Bitch!

190
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:46,593
Call the cops! See if I care!

191
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,070
Oh my back.

192
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,534
Listen, everyone.

193
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:56,432
Everyone sliced their bread in half, right?

194
00:29:56,457 --> 00:30:01,275
Before we add the ingredients, we're
going to put the sauce on the bread.

195
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,002
Mix mayonnaise and mustard in 7:3.

196
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:12,411
Kang Joo-hee.

197
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:16,968
Didn't you bring the ingredients?

198
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:21,380
Wait, did you get into a fight?

199
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:23,496
No.

200
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,126
Let me see.

201
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,874
It's nothing. It's from popping zit.

202
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:11,873
Do as I say.

203
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,133
If not,

204
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:17,769
my mom's going to...

205
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,593
take you to the cops.

206
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:24,538
You'll go to prison.

207
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,510
So?

208
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,342
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

209
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:35,205
Do as I say,

210
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:36,947
then I will give you all the snacks.

211
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:40,958
I'll give you cigarettes too.

212
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,993
You must be out of your damn mind.

213
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,621
My mom...

214
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,516
she's super mad.

215
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:53,355
When she's angry,

216
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,645
she's real scary.

217
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:03,948
Don't stare at me.

218
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:06,462
I get what you're saying,

219
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:09,141
so you enjoy all the snacks and cigarettes.

220
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,297
Asshole.

221
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:54,219
Swear again.

222
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:56,185
That you won't tell anyone.

223
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,210
Yeah.

224
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
By the way...

225
00:34:00,366 --> 00:34:03,056
did you put on lipstick?

226
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:05,937
I did.

227
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,228
- Do you like that?
- I love it.

228
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:11,791
Lie down.

229
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,816
Hm? Okay.

230
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:25,066
Take off your pants. I'm busy.

231
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:26,152
Okay.

232
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,060
Close your eyes.

233
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:37,622
Don't you look at me.

234
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:38,874
Okay.

235
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:51,546
Come, already.

236
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,224
What the...

237
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:04,526
The deal was a hand job only.

238
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:06,778
Retard.

239
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,610
What?

240
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:15,848
Did you lock the door?

241
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:17,904
Hey, open this door right now!

242
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,178
Stop it!

243
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:34,054
Stop it!

244
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,318
Stop!

245
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,569
No!

246
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:46,595
No!

247
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,097
Stop!

What are you looking at?

250
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:00,003
I'm from the social service.

251
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:01,387
Came to check on a few things.

252
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,831
You're making a round, huh?

253
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:06,647
It used to be someone else.

254
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:08,920
Yeah, she's on a leave.

255
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:10,136
I see.

256
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:15,209
I used to live here.

257
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:18,155
Not much has changed.

258
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:20,577
You lived here?

259
00:37:20,602 --> 00:37:21,602
When?

260
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:23,234
In 2005.

261
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,035
Just for a while.

262
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,334
Let me see.

263
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:32,540
Weren't you studying for
the civil services exam?

264
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:34,432
You lived on the 10th floor, didn't you?

265
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:36,293
That's correct.

266
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:38,176
Don't you remember me?

267
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,148
I rented you the apartment.

268
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,980
Oh I remember.

269
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,709
It's good to see you again.

270
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:10,036
Excuse me.

271
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:16,888
What are you doing?

272
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:41,409
Hello? Anybody home?

273
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,496
Hey, I want to talk to you.

274
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:12,871
What?

275
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,600
Who are you?

276
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
I'm from the social service.

277
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:18,825
Sir, what were you doing over there?

278
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,850
What?

279
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:22,851
What were you doing in front
of someone else's place?

280
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,156
Look at him sweating.

281
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:40,060
As you can see, he's not well.
He couldn't harm anyone.

282
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,989
Say it, if you saw him doing anything bad.

283
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:49,133
Cat got your tongue?

284
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:53,594
Why are you harassing good people?

285
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:55,930
Goddammit.

286
00:39:56,516 --> 00:39:58,552
Get out.

287
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:01,319
Get the hell out of here.

288
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:09,781
Are you studying for the
civil services exam?

289
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,441
You're applying for the grade 9.

290
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,722
Which department?

291
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,747
Social services.

292
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,756
I'm applying for the grade 7.

293
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:26,895
Grade 7 in Legal services.

294
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:35,482
Do you have any study group?

295
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:38,276
It's hard to pass the exam
when you study by yourself.

296
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:41,010
It's more efficient to study together.

297
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:42,901
We can share information.

298
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:45,720
Mind your own business, mister.

299
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,284
Mister?

300
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:50,089
I'm not that old.

301
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:52,999
We're about the same age.

302
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:55,031
How old are you?

303
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:59,917
Shouldn't you be studying
instead of hitting on girls?

304
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,729
Actually...

305
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:10,476
I already passed.

306
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:15,257
I went to do physical
after passing the exam.

307
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:18,142
Guess what? I have tuberculosis.

308
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:24,204
I was deferred for a year. They told
me to get the thing fixed first.

309
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:27,779
Isn't that funny? Who gets
tuberculosis these days?

310
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:32,527
Basically, I have nothing to do until
I go to the sanitarium this Fall.

311
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:38,012
I'm just trying to kill time, taking
English classes and et cetera.

312
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,588
For Korean History,

313
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:49,969
get this one.

314
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:54,322
It's written by a famous lecturer.
It's very well organized.

315
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:58,610
It's better to go over the basic
textbook and get to the workbook later.

316
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:01,819
But you have to spend more
time on workbooks though.

317
00:42:01,844 --> 00:42:04,923
It's pretty obvious what kind of
questions will be on the exam.

318
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:07,035
What else?

319
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:32,691
Why do you always hang out here?

320
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:36,964
Your parents are not home?

321
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,192
Excuse me.

322
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,450
You just moved here, no?

323
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,208
That's right.

324
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:35,683
It's good to finally meet you.

325
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:39,507
I'm swamped with work.

326
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:41,532
My name is Kang In-cheol.

327
00:43:41,974 --> 00:43:44,176
I'm your neighbor.

328
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,862
By the way...

329
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,758
have you seen it?

330
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:58,967
What?

331
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:02,016
I guess you didn't know.

332
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:10,018
When I was promoted to an executive,

333
00:44:10,043 --> 00:44:14,249
I decided I should contribute to society.

334
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:17,338
So I started to raise pigs at home.

335
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:20,974
I know it's a bit peculiar.

336
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,965
But these pigs...

337
00:44:25,338 --> 00:44:27,338
they are no ordinary pigs.

338
00:44:27,685 --> 00:44:32,276
They are very intelligent.
They don't obey human.

339
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:34,301
Fucking pigs.

340
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:40,405
So I stopped feeding them for a while.

341
00:44:40,907 --> 00:44:43,383
Then these pigs ran away.

342
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:52,161
You really haven't seen them?

343
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,621
No.

344
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:04,539
Miss.

345
00:45:05,826 --> 00:45:09,229
How long do you think you can keep lying?

346
00:45:11,326 --> 00:45:14,461
Don't justify yourself.

347
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:23,289
Life goes on with or without you.

348
00:45:35,545 --> 00:45:37,792
My, oh my.

349
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,330
I hope I didn't offend you.

350
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,871
If you'd like,

351
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:49,932
come over to our place for dinner.

352
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:52,840
My wife is a great cook.

353
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,520
It's me, honey.

354
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:02,698
What are you doing?

355
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:04,986
You shouldn't be out here
by yourself at this hour.

356
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,197
What did my mom say?

357
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:09,356
Don't be nosy.

358
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:12,823
You fought with your mom, didn't you?

359
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:14,847
Mind your own business.

360
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,012
Hey.

361
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,740
Why are you being so rude?

362
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:38,672
I'm not being nosy.

363
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,117
It's just that you guys are really loud.

364
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,113
I can't study because of the noise.

365
00:47:45,356 --> 00:47:47,230
What do you want me to do?

366
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,255
Why don't you move out then?

367
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:51,129
What did you say?

368
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:57,472
Wouldn't it be nice if things
worked out the way you wanted them?

369
00:47:58,051 --> 00:48:01,496
I wouldn't have born in that family.

370
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:11,915
Did you know that

371
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,793
a whole family died in our apartment?

372
00:48:18,653 --> 00:48:20,435
I guess you didn't.

373
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:24,101
You wouldn't have moved if you knew.

374
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,739
Are you serious?

375
00:48:29,257 --> 00:48:31,257
It was on the news.

376
00:48:31,484 --> 00:48:33,365
Do you know who did it?

377
00:48:34,738 --> 00:48:35,738
The father.

378
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:38,987
He poisoned them all.

379
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:43,275
The funny thing is...

380
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,167
I'd have understood if my dad did that.

381
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:51,718
What would I become?

382
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:56,013
Don't say that.

383
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:02,141
Every morning when I open my eyes,

384
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:06,439
I pray that the whole apartment is gone.

385
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:12,611
It'd be nice if they tore the
building down with a bulldozer.

386
00:49:13,926 --> 00:49:17,074
They say the re-development is on the way.

387
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:18,832
Re-development?

388
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:20,652
As if.

389
00:49:21,214 --> 00:49:24,406
Then what? Is that going
to change the world?

390
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:28,084
The people living in are losers.

391
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,282
You can't do anything about that.

392
00:49:31,483 --> 00:49:33,483
People don't change.

393
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:46,943
You want to hear a funny story?

394
00:49:48,872 --> 00:49:51,863
There are some people I want to see dead.

395
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:56,725
Last night in my dream, they all died.

396
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:00,510
Their skulls crushed, spouting
blood from everywhere.

397
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,776
Gross.

398
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:10,736
The dream was so vivid.

399
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,360
It felt so real.

400
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:18,914
Who died in your dream?

401
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:31,171
You know the grocery store down there?

402
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,794
Ouch, wait.

403
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,291
I need to poop.

404
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:40,036
I'll tell you later.

405
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:46,704
Get inside. You said it's
dangerous to be here alone.

406
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:57,266
Can I sit here?

407
00:50:57,811 --> 00:50:59,811
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone.

408
00:51:21,894 --> 00:51:23,104
Hyun-Jin.

409
00:51:25,263 --> 00:51:27,263
You scared me.

410
00:51:28,108 --> 00:51:29,515
Do you need a place to sit?

411
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:40,169
I saved the seat for you.

412
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:41,459
Come on.

413
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,040
Mister, are you stalking me?

414
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,870
Stalking you?

415
00:51:57,485 --> 00:51:58,798
No way.

416
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:10,266
Since I saved your seat, how about
you buy me a cup of coffee?

417
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:15,451
Yes?

418
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,690
You're not getting one?

419
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:23,355
I don't like instant coffee.
It has high calories.

420
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:26,478
Oh, I guess it's not up to your standard.

421
00:52:27,597 --> 00:52:32,734
You only drink espresso at cafes?

422
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:35,905
Stop teasing me.

423
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,930
I'm not.

424
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:41,486
I wish I knew how to enjoy those,

425
00:52:42,186 --> 00:52:44,022
but my taste is pretty cheap.

426
00:52:47,827 --> 00:52:49,813
It's good.

427
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:54,657
You should get black coffee next time.

428
00:53:00,064 --> 00:53:01,064
I will.

429
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:03,879
Too much calories.

430
00:53:12,173 --> 00:53:15,767
How did you know my name anyways?

431
00:53:16,704 --> 00:53:17,704
Oh that?

432
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:21,803
It's written on your forehead.

433
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:24,493
Seriously.

434
00:53:27,842 --> 00:53:33,277
The strange thing about names is...
your life resembles your name.

435
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:35,302
When I first saw you,

436
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,381
I could tell you were honest and sincere.

437
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:42,428
Thus, Hyun-Jin. (Chinese characters
mean honest and sincere)

438
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:44,541
Are you being serious?

439
00:53:45,683 --> 00:53:48,077
Is that how you find out my name?

440
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:52,183
Actually, it was written
on your textbook cover.

441
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:57,718
You almost fool me there.

442
00:54:08,858 --> 00:54:10,920
Hi there.

443
00:54:12,225 --> 00:54:13,420
What do you want?

444
00:54:13,445 --> 00:54:15,445
I wanted to talk to you.

445
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:18,933
Can we come inside for a sec?

446
00:54:32,454 --> 00:54:34,590
What did you want to talk about?

447
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,832
I wanted to ask you a favor.

448
00:54:41,972 --> 00:54:45,413
Joo-hee's a high school senior.

449
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:51,208
She's a very smart girl, but
she doesn't put any effort.

450
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:56,645
I saw that you stay up late all the time.

451
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:58,943
What do you do at night?

452
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:01,917
I'm studying for the civil services exam.

453
00:55:03,707 --> 00:55:05,707
I knew it.

454
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:12,104
You're always quiet like a cat.
I knew you were a smart girl.

455
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:14,881
Is there any way...

456
00:55:14,906 --> 00:55:17,537
you can tutor Joo-hee?

457
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:22,351
I'll pay you 500 bucks a month.

458
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,584
500 dollars?

459
00:55:28,336 --> 00:55:31,705
How's that? It's pretty good, no?

460
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:37,109
Okay.

461
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:40,997
Phew, that's a load off my chest.

462
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:45,688
My only daughter, she can
be a handful sometimes.

463
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:47,784
Joo-hee.

464
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:52,590
Your dad said he'd support your study
abroad if you get into college.

465
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,778
Give your best.

466
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:02,340
Where are you going?

467
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,329
To get some air.

468
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:05,354
Hey.

469
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:09,100
Did you go to the dentist today?

470
00:56:32,036 --> 00:56:33,468
JOO-hee.

471
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:37,642
You don't want to study with me?

472
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:44,778
Hey, don't you really know?

473
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:46,734
Know what?

474
00:56:47,163 --> 00:56:49,163
My mom's insane.

475
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:52,114
She always says I'm crazy.

476
00:56:52,483 --> 00:56:55,287
But she's the crazy one.

477
00:56:55,804 --> 00:56:57,445
What do you mean?

478
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,470
I'm not joking.

479
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,374
Maybe this apartment is hunted.

480
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,765
She's lost her mind since we moved here.

481
00:57:06,905 --> 00:57:07,905
Hyun-Jin.

482
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,293
Do you really believe she'll pay you?

483
00:57:14,615 --> 00:57:17,865
We don't even have money to pay the bills.

484
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:26,138
Your father has a job.

485
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:31,400
Says who?

486
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:34,415
He quit when I was still
in elementary school.

487
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:36,291
Why?

488
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:40,696
He said he was going to try something else.

489
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:43,483
But the fact of the matter
is that he got laid off.

490
00:57:43,508 --> 00:57:46,787
They lied that they'd give him
a call once things get better.

491
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:50,031
A bunch of people quit,
believing that bull shit.

492
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:52,056
Some of them committed suicide.

493
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:56,969
Your mom said you guys are moving to Seoul
soon because of your dad's promotion.

494
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,515
Another bull crap.

495
00:57:58,704 --> 00:58:01,399
He hasn't worked a day since then.

496
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:08,070
But the strangest thing is...

497
00:58:08,095 --> 00:58:11,307
he gets up early in the
morning, puts on his suit,

498
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,829
and comes back late at night.

499
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:17,282
He's like a ghost.

500
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,220
Do you get it now?

501
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:27,413
We left Seoul to run away from creditors.

502
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:32,005
My mom started seeing things.

503
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,661
She keeps telling people she'd pay.

504
00:58:34,686 --> 00:58:37,770
As if she were sitting on a heap of money.

505
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,225
Hyun-Jin.

506
00:58:42,265 --> 00:58:44,739
Tell her you changed your mind.

507
00:58:44,764 --> 00:58:47,381
Don't blame me later.

508
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,833
Joo-hee.

509
00:59:08,097 --> 00:59:11,071
It's fine with me as long
as you're okay with it.

510
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:14,818
Come over anytime you want to study.

511
00:59:18,294 --> 00:59:20,404
Don't go back on your words later.

512
00:59:21,864 --> 00:59:22,864
I won't.

513
00:59:38,794 --> 00:59:39,888
Hyun-Jin!

514
00:59:44,055 --> 00:59:45,716
I'm so sorry.

515
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:47,741
It's all right. Don't sweat it.

516
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:53,708
I have no napkins.

517
00:59:55,773 --> 00:59:57,664
What's this?

518
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,723
There's milk in coffee.

519
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:04,505
I thought you were worried about calories.

520
01:00:07,955 --> 01:00:10,570
It's your own fault for stalking me.

521
01:00:11,754 --> 01:00:13,878
Hyun-Jin, wait up.

522
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:45,935
You should go home and wash it.
Otherwise, it'll leave stain.

523
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:48,553
Right.

524
01:00:58,383 --> 01:01:01,517
Isn't it tiring to handwash?

525
01:01:02,484 --> 01:01:05,966
I got used to it.

526
01:01:18,282 --> 01:01:19,923
I am going to...

527
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,970
buy you a washer one day.

528
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:26,485
Why would you?

529
01:01:28,402 --> 01:01:31,087
Because I want to.

530
01:01:42,341 --> 01:01:44,940
You were shocked when you first
came in here, weren't you?

531
01:01:44,965 --> 01:01:45,965
What do you mean?

532
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:51,281
Because it's so dirty and seedy.

533
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:55,385
What do you take me for?

534
01:01:56,164 --> 01:01:59,406
Nobody's first apartment is nice.

535
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:09,123
Still, I like this place.

536
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:13,526
I always wanted to live on my own.

537
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:14,821
How come?

538
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:19,742
Because of that woman.

539
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,371
Who?

540
01:02:22,882 --> 01:02:24,882
My mom.

541
01:02:26,124 --> 01:02:28,124
I hated her.

542
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:36,126
Do you know what I hated her?

543
01:02:37,393 --> 01:02:39,651
She's too nice.

544
01:02:42,674 --> 01:02:46,605
She was too nice that she was dumb.

545
01:02:49,659 --> 01:02:51,659
You don't get it, do you?

546
01:02:53,441 --> 01:02:55,441
What's wrong with being nice?

547
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:58,441
When I was a little girl,

548
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,477
I went to a fortunetellerâs
shop with mom.

549
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:05,967
The fortuneteller was startled.

550
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,820
She said my mom and I have
exactly the same fate.

551
01:03:14,685 --> 01:03:18,878
She said we'd destroy each
other if we stayed together.

552
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:27,394
Daughters are supposed to
take after their moms.

553
01:03:31,164 --> 01:03:34,258
I shudder at that thought.

554
01:03:37,844 --> 01:03:42,342
I made trouble on purpose
to break off from her.

555
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:14,727
Hyun-Jin.

556
01:04:19,764 --> 01:04:21,381
I'm so sorry.

557
01:04:22,204 --> 01:04:25,370
- I guess I'm drunk.
- Don't worry about it.

Come here.

560
01:05:53,627 --> 01:05:55,627
Why are you shaking so much?

561
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:57,916
I'm sorry.

562
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,479
No, not there.

563
01:06:06,492 --> 01:06:08,712
A little below.

564
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:18,632
Do you like me?

565
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:20,862
I like you.

566
01:06:22,372 --> 01:06:25,117
You have to treat me well.

567
01:06:25,673 --> 01:06:26,673
Yes.

568
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,998
You must love and adore me only.
Can you do that?

569
01:06:30,864 --> 01:06:32,242
Yes.

570
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,363
I will do that.

571
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,670
That's why I'm with you right now.

572
01:06:39,764 --> 01:06:43,112
If you do that, I'll be really good to you.

573
01:06:45,118 --> 01:06:47,586
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

574
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,352
Wait.

575
01:07:03,662 --> 01:07:04,936
Wait, Kyung-soo.

576
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:12,556
Get the fuck off, asshole!

577
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:14,821
Why are you butting in?

578
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,916
Cut it out.

579
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:19,033
Fuck you.

580
01:08:22,194 --> 01:08:23,194
Hey.

581
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,243
Fucking bitch.

582
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:42,339
Build a castle with steel everyday,

583
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:44,786
build a wall inside the castle,

584
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:47,223
build a house inside the wall,

585
01:08:48,277 --> 01:08:50,277
put a rice bin inside the house,

586
01:08:50,722 --> 01:08:54,008
put a chest inside the rice bin,

587
01:08:54,376 --> 01:08:57,610
hide me inside the chest,

588
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:04,278
and lock it securely with gold turtle lock.

589
01:09:10,702 --> 01:09:12,702
What kind of poem is this?

590
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,571
I mean, if he misses his ex,

591
01:09:20,116 --> 01:09:23,436
why doesn't he go find her? Loser.

592
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:38,501
What's that?

593
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:40,883
Dope.

594
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:43,868
You want to try?

595
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,614
Say 'ah.'

596
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:01,298
It's just sugar cube.

597
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:05,066
It works great when you feel sluggish.

598
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,955
How's it? Do you feel it?

599
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:12,884
Yeah, it goes straight to my brain.

600
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:15,223
Told you so.

601
01:10:22,245 --> 01:10:23,245
Hyun-Jin,

602
01:10:23,829 --> 01:10:26,104
is it easy to pass the civil services exam?

603
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:28,848
Nothing's easy in this world.

604
01:10:30,765 --> 01:10:32,765
What's great about being a civil servant?

605
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,100
Do they pay you a lot?

606
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:37,044
No, not really.

607
01:10:38,227 --> 01:10:40,779
It's stable and gives you a good pension.

608
01:10:43,662 --> 01:10:47,193
Then, at least you won't
end up like my dad.

609
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:54,639
Should I go for civil services too?

610
01:10:56,326 --> 01:10:58,326
You can think about it
after you go to college.

611
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:00,351
Go study now.

612
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Fine.

613
01:12:18,756 --> 01:12:20,331
Hello.

614
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,756
Hi, Hyun-Jin. It's me.

615
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:25,135
Hey.

616
01:12:25,636 --> 01:12:27,185
Is everything okay?

617
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,210
You don't sound so good.

618
01:12:28,585 --> 01:12:31,024
Yes, I was dozing off.

619
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:36,142
Hyun-Jin, can you come
downstairs for a sec?

620
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:38,095
What's going on?

621
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:40,588
You'll see.

622
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,775
Hyun-Jin!

623
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,554
How are you?

624
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:12,082
What is this?

625
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:16,703
I thought we could go for a drive.
It's such a nice weather.

626
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,555
Let's go.

627
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,820
Actually...

628
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:00,865
I have something to tell you.

629
01:14:09,731 --> 01:14:11,950
It was my first time.

630
01:14:12,183 --> 01:14:14,183
What is?

631
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,778
You know... sex.

632
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:25,793
Are you serious?

633
01:14:26,942 --> 01:14:27,942
Yes.

634
01:14:29,783 --> 01:14:33,179
How is that possible?

635
01:14:34,202 --> 01:14:37,242
You've never slept with your girlfriends?

636
01:14:38,734 --> 01:14:40,734
I've never dated anyone.

637
01:14:42,295 --> 01:14:44,295
Oh my.

638
01:14:45,756 --> 01:14:49,324
But I thought guys go to red district

639
01:14:50,433 --> 01:14:53,730
before enlisting in the army.

640
01:14:54,477 --> 01:14:57,287
You've never been to places like that?

641
01:15:00,952 --> 01:15:02,752
You're embarrassing me.

642
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:05,914
You might not know,

643
01:15:06,388 --> 01:15:10,424
but some guys don't get a chance
to do it until they are over 30.

644
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,811
Unbelievable.

645
01:15:17,328 --> 01:15:19,385
My friend said...

646
01:15:23,194 --> 01:15:26,361
You're my savior.

647
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,346
That's why I took you out today.
To thank you.

648
01:15:31,283 --> 01:15:32,283
What?

649
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,645
- Kyung-soo.
- Yeah?

650
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:49,079
What's your dream?

651
01:15:49,903 --> 01:15:50,903
Dream?

652
01:15:52,216 --> 01:15:53,216
Hm.

653
01:15:57,026 --> 01:15:59,064
I can't think of one. It's too sudden.

654
01:15:59,709 --> 01:16:02,358
You don't have any?

655
01:16:03,093 --> 01:16:07,005
If you can't answer it right away,
it means you don't have one.

656
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:09,809
What kind of a guy doesn't have a dream?

657
01:16:16,575 --> 01:16:17,784
Kyung-soo,

658
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,292
do you know what my dream is?

659
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:27,145
I had no dream, nothing
to look for, all my life.

660
01:16:30,179 --> 01:16:32,734
But since I met you,

661
01:16:33,032 --> 01:16:35,032
I started to want something.

662
01:16:36,606 --> 01:16:37,783
What's that?

663
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:42,198
It's...

664
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:44,924
you know.

665
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,020
I'm not telling you.

666
01:16:52,503 --> 01:16:55,375
Come back here.

667
01:17:50,269 --> 01:17:51,269
Hyun-Jin.

668
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:54,647
It's all right.

669
01:17:55,974 --> 01:17:58,707
I want to do it for you.

670
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:12,426
The house under your name is
valued above the threshold.

671
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:15,554
You're not qualified to be
a basic income recipient.

672
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,166
Excuse me?

673
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:22,456
Please don't get upset, sir.

674
01:18:23,352 --> 01:18:25,198
Sir. Hello?

675
01:18:35,436 --> 01:18:38,029
Ms. Park. Come here for a sec.

676
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,393
What's going on?

677
01:18:49,418 --> 01:18:52,011
We got a call from the
city services auditor.

678
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:53,207
What?

679
01:18:53,598 --> 01:18:55,598
Does a name Kang Hyung-goo ring a bell?

680
01:18:55,971 --> 01:18:59,007
His mother is calling everywhere,
complaining about you.

681
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:01,032
She said you threatened him.

682
01:19:01,057 --> 01:19:02,453
That's not true.

683
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:04,986
He was acting suspicious in
front of someone's apartment.

684
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:07,010
I gave him a little warning, that's it.

685
01:19:07,035 --> 01:19:09,868
Maybe you didn't know about it.

686
01:19:10,282 --> 01:19:12,282
He does that all the time.

687
01:19:12,307 --> 01:19:14,086
He has a disability.

688
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:16,111
He doesn't know what's right and wrong.

689
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:23,409
Just go apologize.

690
01:19:23,768 --> 01:19:26,636
The lady's intense.

691
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,270
I don't think I can do that.

692
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:46,975
Where do you think you're going?

693
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:47,999
Piss off.

694
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:49,996
You need to pay back my cigarette.

695
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:51,089
Get your hands off of me.

696
01:19:51,114 --> 01:19:53,925
It's not my fault that you got caught.

697
01:19:54,402 --> 01:19:56,949
I got caught because YOU
were smoking my cigarette.

698
01:19:56,974 --> 01:19:59,390
Go home and jerk yourself, douchebag

699
01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:01,511
That mouth of hers.

700
01:20:01,653 --> 01:20:02,957
Bitch!

701
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:04,383
Hey.

702
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:06,621
That was too much.

703
01:20:07,175 --> 01:20:09,175
Just payback my cigarette.

704
01:20:11,637 --> 01:20:13,105
The fuck you're looking at?

705
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,501
Get me my cigarette now.

706
01:20:15,526 --> 01:20:17,144
Fine.

707
01:20:17,635 --> 01:20:19,059
I'll give to you tomorrow.

708
01:20:20,277 --> 01:20:23,063
It takes a beating, doesn't it?

709
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,332
Is it true that your nickname is THIS PLUS?
(Korean cigarette brand)

710
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:28,624
- THIS PLUS?
- What's that?

711
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:30,605
You know the retard at the grocery store,

712
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,055
that's her boyfriend.

713
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:33,282
No way.

714
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:35,643
She fucks for the cigarette.

715
01:20:36,559 --> 01:20:38,537
Come on. I don't believe that.

716
01:20:38,873 --> 01:20:41,633
- It's not even Marlboro?
- Go ask him.

717
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:43,864
Marlboro? That was funny.

718
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:46,960
I'll take sex instead of
cigarette, if you'd like.

719
01:20:47,763 --> 01:20:48,610
Come on, man.

720
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:50,581
Fuck off!

721
01:20:51,698 --> 01:20:53,604
Fucking slut.

722
01:20:53,637 --> 01:20:55,637
I wouldn't fuck you even if you offered.

723
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:57,127
Let's go.

724
01:21:48,545 --> 01:21:50,545
Garbage bags, please.

725
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,050
Take your change.

726
01:22:28,064 --> 01:22:29,424
Joo-hee.

727
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,053
I was wondering

728
01:22:33,078 --> 01:22:35,835
where do you get the money
for cigs and makeups?

729
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:38,823
You want to know?

730
01:22:39,904 --> 01:22:41,904
I have a part time job.

731
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,175
Where do you work?

732
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,208
You don't need to know.

733
01:22:49,784 --> 01:22:56,242
I realized that a slight shift in
perspective makes life much easier.

734
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:59,109
What kind of talk is that?

735
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:02,889
You should aspire for bigger things.
You're in your prime.

736
01:23:03,967 --> 01:23:06,740
Right. Everyone says that.

737
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,771
That I'm in my prime to fuck.

738
01:23:10,488 --> 01:23:11,488
What?

739
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:14,409
What did you just say?

740
01:23:47,107 --> 01:23:49,107
Here they go again.

741
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:53,507
- Who's that?
- My mom.

742
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:56,722
She does that when she's drunk.

Hyun-Jin.

745
01:26:16,318 --> 01:26:18,123
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

746
01:26:18,901 --> 01:26:22,175
The folks at the grocery store died.

747
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,760
You came all the way here to tell me that?

748
01:26:26,839 --> 01:26:28,306
Don't you remember?

749
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:30,949
- The dream you had.
- Oh that.

750
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:33,470
What about it?

751
01:26:33,495 --> 01:26:35,072
Maybe dreams come true after all.

752
01:26:35,165 --> 01:26:36,573
Joo-hee!

753
01:26:37,681 --> 01:26:40,962
Stop fooling around. Where
did you go last night?

754
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,950
I was at your place, remember?

755
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,766
After that!

756
01:26:46,316 --> 01:26:48,087
My mom texted me. I went home.

757
01:26:48,144 --> 01:26:49,547
Don't lie to me!

758
01:26:49,572 --> 01:26:52,658
I saw you going into the store.

759
01:26:57,763 --> 01:26:59,495
Fine. I'll tell you the truth.

760
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,132
I did go there.

761
01:27:02,432 --> 01:27:06,604
What's so weird about me
going to the grocery store?

762
01:27:08,217 --> 01:27:09,526
Why did you go there?

763
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:11,551
To buy cigarette.

764
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:14,816
Why did you go there of all places?

765
01:27:15,344 --> 01:27:16,344
Answer me.

766
01:27:17,369 --> 01:27:18,810
What's the matter with you?

767
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:24,329
They don't check my id like
other stores do, that's why.

768
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,970
Where do you get the money for it?

769
01:27:33,725 --> 01:27:35,148
For cigarettes.

770
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:37,871
Did you pay?

771
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:43,922
Tell me.

772
01:27:44,703 --> 01:27:48,359
Do you pay for your cigarette or not?

773
01:27:49,883 --> 01:27:50,883
Hyun-Jin.

774
01:27:52,804 --> 01:27:54,804
I don't know what rumors you heard, but...

775
01:27:59,256 --> 01:28:01,256
You are just like them.

776
01:28:02,522 --> 01:28:04,522
I'm so sick of it.

777
01:28:25,999 --> 01:28:27,351
How are you?

778
01:28:27,556 --> 01:28:29,556
It's awful.

779
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:33,383
Sir.

780
01:28:34,675 --> 01:28:36,675
What happened?

781
01:28:37,384 --> 01:28:38,937
Didn't you see the news?

782
01:28:39,114 --> 01:28:41,114
There was a murder.

783
01:28:41,139 --> 01:28:43,924
The lady and her son both died.

784
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:49,510
The neighborhood's been quiet
for a while, but now this?

785
01:28:52,469 --> 01:28:54,078
Who did that?

786
01:28:54,445 --> 01:28:55,547
Nobody knows.

787
01:28:56,437 --> 01:28:58,493
I'm sure they'll caught the guy soon.

788
01:28:58,988 --> 01:29:01,489
Whoever it is, we've got
a real sick psycho.

789
01:29:01,746 --> 01:29:02,746
Hm?

790
01:29:03,159 --> 01:29:06,540
He smashed their skulls
with something really hard

791
01:29:06,857 --> 01:29:09,637
and put the plastic bag over
their heads to suffocate them.

792
01:29:14,851 --> 01:29:16,293
The thing is...

793
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:19,030
I saw something odd that night.

794
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:22,671
I was taking a walk on this
street after midnight,

795
01:29:23,764 --> 01:29:26,779
and saw someone coming out of the store.

796
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:29,283
Who?

797
01:29:29,683 --> 01:29:33,168
You know the girl who
lives on the 10th floor?

798
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:37,177
I always thought she was a little weird.

799
01:29:40,898 --> 01:29:43,695
Did you talk to the police?

800
01:29:44,906 --> 01:29:46,258
No.

801
01:29:46,283 --> 01:29:49,286
I don't want to get involved
in a thing like this.

802
01:30:39,953 --> 01:30:41,953
Are you coming in now?

803
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:46,123
How did you get in here?

804
01:30:46,155 --> 01:30:48,155
The door was open.

805
01:30:48,592 --> 01:30:50,218
You're forgetful, aren't you?

806
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,458
I was wondering...

807
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:59,150
have you seen Joo-hee?

808
01:30:59,575 --> 01:31:02,024
She didn't come home last night.

809
01:31:04,516 --> 01:31:05,516
No.

810
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:08,490
I haven't seen her.

811
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:13,461
That's strange.

812
01:31:13,957 --> 01:31:15,957
Where did she go?

813
01:31:16,414 --> 01:31:18,414
I thought she was with you.

814
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:23,676
Hey.

815
01:31:25,007 --> 01:31:27,007
Did Joo-hee say anything to you?

816
01:31:29,787 --> 01:31:31,787
About what?

817
01:31:39,555 --> 01:31:42,446
She has a screw loose.

818
01:31:43,219 --> 01:31:46,625
Don't believe whatever she tells you.

819
01:31:47,797 --> 01:31:48,797
Understand?

820
01:31:55,481 --> 01:31:58,083
She's already got an appetite for men.

821
01:31:58,661 --> 01:32:00,661
I wonder what she'll become.

822
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,060
Shit.

823
01:32:03,961 --> 01:32:08,084
That bitch. After all I've done for her.

824
01:32:09,647 --> 01:32:13,882
She's flirting with men her father's age.

825
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,847
What are you talking about?

826
01:32:18,454 --> 01:32:20,257
Guess what she did.

827
01:32:44,579 --> 01:32:46,106
We need to talk.

828
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,239
No we don't.

829
01:32:49,153 --> 01:32:50,817
Joo-hee.

830
01:32:51,896 --> 01:32:54,113
I'm sorry about what I said yesterday.

831
01:32:54,432 --> 01:32:56,432
I was wrong.

832
01:32:57,646 --> 01:32:59,646
But tell me.

833
01:33:00,822 --> 01:33:04,215
What kind of relationship do
you have with your dentist?

834
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,430
I don't believe this shit.

835
01:33:07,812 --> 01:33:09,070
Are you spying on me?

836
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,261
Why would you do such thing?

837
01:33:13,574 --> 01:33:15,574
Don't you know it's wrong?

838
01:33:17,043 --> 01:33:18,498
Who do you think you are?

839
01:33:18,656 --> 01:33:23,427
You're not my mother. Why
do you keep bugging me?

840
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:29,032
I guess you really are like that.

841
01:33:29,259 --> 01:33:30,492
That's right.

842
01:33:30,525 --> 01:33:32,086
I'm like this.

843
01:33:32,405 --> 01:33:35,239
And you're a piece of shit.

844
01:33:37,054 --> 01:33:39,453
Is that really the only way?

845
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:43,780
What else can I do?

846
01:33:45,147 --> 01:33:49,396
Should I quit school and work part
time job that pays $4 an hour?

847
01:33:52,255 --> 01:33:53,991
Then what?

848
01:33:54,429 --> 01:33:57,317
How am I going to live with my
deranged parents with that money?

849
01:33:57,708 --> 01:34:01,365
Since we started running
away from creditors,

850
01:34:02,045 --> 01:34:05,002
I've never received any
allowance whatsoever.

851
01:34:05,027 --> 01:34:07,027
I have to pay for school.

852
01:34:07,535 --> 01:34:11,072
I have to pay for textbooks, gym uniforms,
school trip, everything on my own.

853
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:13,245
Still!

854
01:34:13,525 --> 01:34:16,338
Your mom's worried sick.

855
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:24,233
Hyun-Jin.

856
01:34:26,253 --> 01:34:28,253
Do you...

857
01:34:29,042 --> 01:34:33,159
really think my mom sends me to the
dentist to get my teeth treated?

858
01:35:59,605 --> 01:36:01,605
I am so sorry.

859
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:03,757
Was I too loud?

860
01:36:05,671 --> 01:36:06,671
Right,

861
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:09,250
it's bad manners.

862
01:36:09,423 --> 01:36:14,443
I hear some people even commit
a murder because of the noise.

863
01:36:20,021 --> 01:36:21,021
Are you looking at this?

864
01:36:26,018 --> 01:36:29,213
This is all I have.

865
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:32,458
What are you doing?

866
01:36:36,703 --> 01:36:40,446
I have to go to work in the morning.

867
01:36:41,196 --> 01:36:43,532
That's why I'm doing this now.

868
01:36:46,189 --> 01:36:49,670
I should have asked you first.

869
01:36:50,772 --> 01:36:52,042
The truth is...

870
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:54,371
I killed the pigs.

871
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:59,479
The damn pigs won't get fat no
matter how much I feed them.

872
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:04,214
I like them fat.

873
01:37:05,289 --> 01:37:06,722
That's why...

874
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:08,390
I killed them.

875
01:37:34,841 --> 01:37:36,506
Joo-hee!

876
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,851
Hyun-Jin, what are you doing?

877
01:37:40,294 --> 01:37:41,791
Did I wake you?

878
01:37:41,816 --> 01:37:44,458
Where are you Joo-hee? Are you all right?

879
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:50,629
Joo-hee!

880
01:37:53,544 --> 01:37:55,544
Are you there?

881
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:57,579
Hyun-Jin.

882
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:00,830
Do you hear this?

883
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,389
Yeah.

884
01:38:26,992 --> 01:38:28,992
I hear you.

885
01:38:29,482 --> 01:38:31,482
Try knocking on the wall.

886
01:38:42,173 --> 01:38:44,078
It's so clear.

887
01:38:48,972 --> 01:38:50,395
Joo-hee.

888
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:53,927
Are you all right?

889
01:38:58,237 --> 01:38:59,237
Hyun-Jin,

890
01:39:00,721 --> 01:39:04,385
can I come over?

891
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,440
Sure.

892
01:39:10,096 --> 01:39:11,096
I'll be right here.

893
01:39:39,247 --> 01:39:42,063
Today's my birthday.

894
01:39:42,557 --> 01:39:43,557
But...

895
01:39:44,556 --> 01:39:47,441
you were the only person I could think of.

896
01:39:49,721 --> 01:39:51,768
Aren't you going to say happy birthday?

897
01:39:51,996 --> 01:39:56,010
I need at least one person
to be happy that I was born.

898
01:39:57,807 --> 01:40:00,191
Look! I brought beer.

899
01:40:08,039 --> 01:40:09,039
Wait.

900
01:40:09,854 --> 01:40:12,631
Let's do cake later.

901
01:40:19,955 --> 01:40:20,955
Cheers.

902
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:37,083
Joo-hee.

903
01:40:39,115 --> 01:40:41,504
You sure you're all right?

904
01:40:47,905 --> 01:40:49,425
If you want to talk...

905
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:50,450
Shh.

906
01:40:53,857 --> 01:40:56,659
It's enough that you're here.

907
01:40:57,995 --> 01:40:59,995
I mean it.

908
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,945
Joo-hee!

909
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:50,657
No...

910
01:42:51,853 --> 01:42:53,853
Joo-hee.

911
01:42:55,014 --> 01:42:57,014
Please...

912
01:42:58,084 --> 01:42:59,993
Joo-hee!

Hi, guys.

915
01:44:27,309 --> 01:44:30,527
Do you guys live here?

916
01:45:08,599 --> 01:45:09,901
Take a seat.

917
01:45:37,801 --> 01:45:40,247
Look how much you grew up.

918
01:45:41,191 --> 01:45:45,035
When did you get back?

919
01:45:50,657 --> 01:45:52,657
What are you doing here?

01:45:57,232 --> 01:45:58,959
Nothing.

921
01:45:59,905 --> 01:46:01,436
I was just passing by.

922
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:03,639
So...

923
01:46:04,436 --> 01:46:06,920
what you've been up to?

924
01:46:09,128 --> 01:46:11,380
I work at the community service center.

925
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:13,811
You're a civil servant?

926
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:20,424
Are you married?

927
01:46:22,558 --> 01:46:24,517
- Yes.
- That's good.

928
01:46:25,784 --> 01:46:27,965
I knew you'd make it.

929
01:46:45,604 --> 01:46:47,604
Joo-hee.

930
01:46:53,964 --> 01:46:56,735
I came by today because I
was worried about you.

931
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:02,997
Why would you?

932
01:47:03,911 --> 01:47:05,911
Why would you worry about me?

933
01:47:05,936 --> 01:47:07,388
Are you my mom?

934
01:47:07,864 --> 01:47:09,290
Are you my sister?

935
01:47:09,521 --> 01:47:11,527
What do you want from me?

936
01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:16,710
If you care about me so much, then
where have you been all these years?

937
01:47:17,186 --> 01:47:19,576
Where were you?

938
01:47:20,671 --> 01:47:22,671
- Joo-hee!
- Stop talking about Joo-hee!

939
01:47:30,448 --> 01:47:32,119
Joo-hee.

940
01:47:32,173 --> 01:47:34,852
Calm down and let's talk.

941
01:47:35,354 --> 01:47:36,354
Tell me...

942
01:47:37,263 --> 01:47:39,263
what happened?

943
01:47:40,749 --> 01:47:43,195
Stop it, please.

944
01:47:44,461 --> 01:47:46,461
Why do you keep calling Joo-hee?

945
01:47:46,486 --> 01:47:48,877
She's dead!

946
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:57,267
Dead?

947
01:47:59,377 --> 01:48:01,377
You know Joo-hee.

948
01:48:02,451 --> 01:48:04,451
The girl next door.

949
01:48:05,637 --> 01:48:07,637
She's dead.

950
01:48:12,449 --> 01:48:15,084
You're not dead.

951
01:48:15,487 --> 01:48:19,277
You're right here, talking to me.

952
01:48:44,245 --> 01:48:46,245
Stop lying.

953
01:48:49,188 --> 01:48:51,488
I saw it.

954
01:48:52,431 --> 01:48:55,548
I saw her jumping off the roof.

955
01:48:58,446 --> 01:48:59,923
Joo-hee.

956
01:49:00,773 --> 01:49:02,773
That's not true.

957
01:49:03,346 --> 01:49:04,667
Listen to me.

958
01:49:04,692 --> 01:49:06,692
She's not dead?

959
01:49:11,089 --> 01:49:13,089
That doesn't make any sense.

960
01:51:47,113 --> 01:51:48,657
Fucking bitch.

961
01:52:23,090 --> 01:52:25,238
Hyun-Jin, the washer is here.

962
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:27,968
Hyun-Jin.

963
01:52:39,782 --> 01:52:42,119
Hyun... Jin...
