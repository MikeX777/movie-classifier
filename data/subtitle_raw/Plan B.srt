00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,659
<i> Chess is generally known
as a royal game. </i>

2
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:32,395
<i> But sometimes people overlook the fact </i>

3
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,869
<i> that a few pawns
can seriously kick ass. </i>

4
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,224
Shit, they're all over the place.

5
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,601
Now what?

6
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:14,479
Plan B.

7
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:16,433
- What?
- What is Plan B?

8
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,467
This is Plan B.

9
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,712
That's Plan B?

10
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:24,876
You could have cleaned up.

11
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,164
Let's go, then.

12
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:52,769
Yeah!

13
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:55,148
Can't you carry anymore?

14
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:56,603
A bit too much, huh?

15
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:00,479
Yeah, okay.

16
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,783
Come on, you jerk!

17
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
- Shit, I'm out of ammo.
- Give me a go.

18
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,144
- I'm empty too.
- Great!

19
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:56,292
Watch out!

20
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,129
What's wrong?

21
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:03,654
The boss is in there.
He called us wankers!

22
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:04,993
Shit!

23
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
I see you, you wankers!

24
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,159
What do we do?

25
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,728
- Come on, cocksuckers!
- Do you have a pen?

26
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:14,363
A pen?

27
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,734
I'll shoot you another asshole!

28
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:18,378
Huh?

29
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,280
FUCK YOU

30
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:29,428
Fuck!

31
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,888
That's how it's gotta be, right?

32
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,014
With some shooting, fight action.

33
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,764
It'll be awesome!
Cha, react!

34
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:47,177
Okay...

35
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,975
- You know what I mean, right?
- No.

36
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:52,762
Like... fight action...
Phong, react!

37
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,410
Ah.

38
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:58,297
Yeah.

39
00:06:59,059 --> 00:06:59,855
- Ah!
- Yeah!

40
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,178
That's good, that's good!
That's really good.

41
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,882
Did you bring these guys?
Great.

42
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:06,996
You're fired.

43
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,403
But... the way you want to do it
isn't going to work.

44
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:18,787
It's either that way or not at all.

45
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:22,877
Interesting.

46
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,534
Listen to me, George Michael,
it's going to be exciting.

47
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:33,092
Take Jackie Chan and Jet Li and piss off
from my set before I kick your ass.

48
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:34,188
Got it?

49
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:39,761
Idiots.

50
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,990
<i> These boys were about to become
my best friends. </i>

51
00:07:56,291 --> 00:08:02,222
PLAN B

52
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,380
Subrip and re-edited by: phntalytee

53
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,573
Why can't I be at the funeral?

54
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,524
Aleksey was my brother-in-law.

55
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,406
<i> And this gentleman
is my worst nightmare... </i>

56
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,264
<i>My biggest enemy.</i>

57
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,742
Two days' work for nothing again!

58
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,987
- He knows nothing about action.
- I do the action here.

59
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:17,933
I work my ass off
to get you big jobs, big money...

60
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:20,661
The only big thing on this job
was the make-up girl.

61
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,290
As big as the other jobs before that?

62
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,165
Bullshit.

63
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,858
<i> This is U-Gin, by the way. </i>

64
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,101
<i> The four have been inseparable
since childhood. </i>

65
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:31,889
<i> U-Gin isn't a gifted stuntman
like the others,

66
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:34,294
<i> so he declared himself their manager. </i>

67
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,499
<i> And that despite the fact
that he really sucks at numbers. </i>

68
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:42,386
Are you serious?

69
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,608
If Can keeps playing the diva,
there'll be no more jobs!

70
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:50,138
- "Diva"? We're the best!
- But you're not professionals!

71
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,745
If you were, you'd put your asses on the line
and wait for it!

72
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,828
- So we're whores?
- Do I look like a pimp?

73
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,403
- At least they get money.
- As a beginner you get paid less.

74
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,111
We've been starting up
for six years now!

75
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:03,859
Guys, we can't go on like this.

76
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,019
By the way,
I have something to tell you.

77
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:08,860
Hi, baby.

78
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:12,661
I'm coming home right now.
I'll cook.

79
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:14,200
Sorry, guys.

80
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:16,632
- Phong, I'll help you look.
- For what?

81
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:17,911
Your balls, jackass!

82
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:20,985
Funny!

83
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:23,497
Come on, it wasn't bad.

84
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:29,462
- What did you want to tell us?
- Fuck it.

85
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:33,116
- What's wrong with him lately?
- No idea, man.

86
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:36,319
Oh fuck, that late?
I have to get to the office.

87
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,101
Shit.

88
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:41,866
<i> The queen is the piece
with the most freedom to move. </i>

89
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,007
She can move straight

90
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:46,126
or diagonally.

91
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
But she has to decide on one move.

92
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:55,077
If she leaves the chosen path,

93
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,623
she gets unpredictable...

94
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:03,029
and the king will deem her... useless.

95
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,795
The car is here.

96
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,944
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, sweetie.

97
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,486
INVITATION TO JOB INTERVIEW

98
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:43,262
Yes!

99
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:47,893
How are you two?

100
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:49,483
Great.

101
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:55,604
- I think I hear a heartbeat.
- That's mine, you dope.

102
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,333
- Really? / That loud?
- Yeah.

103
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:12,047
You're the sickness, I'm the cure!

104
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:14,454
You're the sickness, I'm the cure!

105
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:30,084
- You're the sickness, I'm the...
- Can!

106
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:34,491
Can! Did you take out the garbage?

107
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,749
Yes.

108
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:40,645
- Don't forget to get the garbage out.
- Okay, mum.

109
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,861
- Then come and eat.
- Okay!

110
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,163
Are you posing infront of the mirror?

111
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:46,674
Of course not!

112
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:14,926
Yes, we have time for you.

113
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:17,556
Trust me, you're getting
the best for this job.

114
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:18,936
Yep.

115
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:22,184
Shall we say tomorrow at 2pm?

116
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:25,446
Of course. All right.

117
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,951
The hallway's got to be cleaned...

118
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:35,935
No problem.
Remember... We clean up. Ciao!

119
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,678
Fisher's Isle, tomorrow at 2pm.

120
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,939
- Do a good job.
- Am I supposed to do it alone?

121
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:51,743
Great.

122
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,219
Reel Deal Action Design,
U-Gin speaking, how can I help?

123
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:04,161
Yes, that's right.
Yes.

124
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,457
I have the best stuntmen in town.

125
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,599
For the lowest price,
if you get me.

126
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,221
Yes... Today?

127
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:12,517
Okay.

128
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,373
One moment, I'll write it down.

129
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:18,705
Okay.

130
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,446
No, we'll be there.

131
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,833
Yes. Thanks, bye!

132
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,603
Nice!

133
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,984
Private calls on work time...

134
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,799
- That's a pay cut
- What?

135
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,558
If I take a breather, it's pay cut.

136
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:39,142
If I have to pee, it's pay cut!
Can I do something without a pay cut?

137
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,350
If you don't like it...

138
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,649
I can find some new idiot anytime.

139
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:01,333
- Yo! Bro?
- Yo, chilla, what's up?

140
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,349
- Yo.
- Yes, I'll be there in a sec!

141
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:08,192
- Everything okay?
- Yes. I got a great casting call.

142
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,814
- Really?
- Yeah, let's meet up later.

143
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,287
- See you later.
- See ya!

144
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:16,003
Cool!

145
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,721
Help...

146
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,510
Congratulations, you got lucky.
Babysitting Kopp.

147
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,132
Babysitting? He's an old hand.

148
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,194
- He had some bad luck.
- Bad luck? Kopp is a loser.

149
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,648
He's been chasing
this Gabriel for years.

150
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:08,801
Some important files are missing
and the case has to be closed.

151
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:12,412
A lot of bad-mouthing
from you guys over there.

152
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,316
You know why
he's been transferred here, right?

153
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:20,139
He shot his partner.
He was between him and a suspect.

154
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:24,348
Three bullets into the leg,
without blinking!

155
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,864
- You know his nickname?
- RoboKopp. So?

156
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:31,282
So? He may have caught
the suspect, but...

157
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,976
his partner is on the disability pension.

158
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:37,863
He's crazy. Take care he doesn't
get you into the same shit.

159
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,256
See you.

160
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,302
So...

161
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:16,585
since we're forced to work
with each other...

162
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,739
we should talk straight.

163
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:22,783
If you want to know something...
just ask me.

164
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:28,208
<i> And this guy, who is about
to ask my favourite question, </i>

165
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,604
<i> was to be my new partner: </i>

166
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:36,181
Is what Plöger says true?

167
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,413
That you shot your partner?

168
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,973
If we two ever get
into the same situation,

169
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,670
I'll show you how it happened.

170
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,478
Guys, at 4pm,
your lives are gonna change.

171
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:06,609
Can, you and your kebabs!
Next time we get Asian food.

172
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:09,713
- You know I don't like noodles.
- But they're healthier.

173
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,692
Vegetables, fish, lean meat...

174
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,922
I've got vegetables in here.
It's healthy too.

175
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,466
Okay time out! Are we here
to swap recipes?

176
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:21,687
- Should I get you onto a cooking show?
- What's so urgent?

177
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,200
Guys...

178
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,570
I got you into
a top casting!

179
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,075
- Shit. It's going to be a "top casting".

180
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,481
Why don't you listen first?

181
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:35,217
- It's for a German movie.
- Do we get paid?

182
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:38,035
- It's a low-budget thing.
- Shit.

183
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,539
Do you think I can pull the best jobs
out of my ass?

184
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:44,442
Is he being serious?
Is he texting his lady?

185
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,029
- Man, I have to do some shopping.
- Shit, who's eating all that?

186
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,181
You're playing housewife now?

187
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,021
Ulla earns the money,
I can at least do the shopping.

188
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:58,621
What are you laughing at?

189
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,206
Who's still living with Mummy
and gets his undies ironed?

190
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,231
Fair.

191
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,066
Okay guys, what about the casting?

192
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:06,914
If it's as good as you say, I'm in.

193
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,340
- Cool!
- Nice.

194
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,453
Guys, I'm out.
I can't go on like this.

195
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,251
What do you mean?

196
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,170
How many castings do you want to do?

197
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,144
How many have we had
and what have we acheived?

198
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,236
It's over for me.

199
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,141
It ain't over till it's over!

200
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:24,668
Your Stallone quotes
will be over too.

201
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,291
I understand you.
Let's just do it this one time!

202
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:29,867
- Just one more time.
- Come on.

203
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:30,813
Yeah, come on.

204
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:36,802
Come on! Come on! Come on!

205
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,350
Stop it!

206
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,700
Okay, Okay.

207
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:43,977
But I'm telling you...
just this one time.

208
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,068
- Aye! Meet in an hour?
- I'm in.

209
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,693
- Nice.
- And you know what?

210
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,450
I've got a great idea.

211
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,096
Sounds good!

212
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:31,933
Wow.

213
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:43,395
Are you serious!
Going to a fancy-dress ball?

214
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:45,093
Fancy-dress ball?

215
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:46,519
-Bruce Lee.
-Marty McFly.

216
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:47,753
Cobretti.

217
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,049
- Right
- We've got something for you, too.

218
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,190
- I'm not wearing that.
- We're all in the same boat.

219
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:57,069
- Forget it.
- U-Gin, you're one of us, right?

220
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,989
Just shut up and put on the jacket.

221
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:27,597
Nice. Cool location.
Hell of a job again.

222
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:53,289
Hey.

223
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:56,246
Don't give up just yet, blondie.

224
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,404
We're not done yet.

225
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,969
I've already told you everything I know.

226
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:18,746
If you're lying, you dirty little bitch...

227
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:23,309
Gabriel's gonna get you
back in little slices

228
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:26,896
like a fucking Serrano ham.

229
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:28,656
Cool!

230
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:31,457
Guys, we really gotta
leave an impression.

231
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:34,656
- Crap.
- Chill, man. Trust me.

232
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:37,376
No solos this time.

233
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:39,487
Okay, what do you want to do?

234
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,806
We are the sickness, you are...

235
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,256
Shit. Sorry.

236
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:48,162
One moment.
Fuck.

237
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:51,925
Didn't I say "no solos this time?

238
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,021
Are you ready?

239
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,989
- You're the sickness, we are the cure!
- Yeah!

240
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:03,581
Yo! We're Reel Deal Action Design.
We have an appointment at 4pm.

241
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,391
Cool location, huh?

242
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:10,175
Shit! Guys!

243
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,924
Shit!

244
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,313
Oh shit!

245
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:46,183
<i> That's Eddie.
What can be said about him? </i>

246
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:50,535
<i> Small-time crook, megalomaniac,
and really crazy </i>

247
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,212
<i> And pretty ruthless. </i>

248
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:58,129
- Hey.
- Shut up!

249
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:01,842
- Did Gabriel send you?
- Who?

250
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:07,199
We... are here for the casting.

251
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,716
Congratulations. You're about to play corpses.

252
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:13,392
Seems like you idiots
have turned up in the wrong movie.

253
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,228
Roll credits.
Kill them.

254
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,106
No, wait.

255
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:24,181
Eddie, come here...

256
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:32,589
<i>Great. The address is Neues Ufer 96</i>

257
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:37,946
69, a very alluring number.

258
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:41,768
It has almost nothing
to do with 96, except...

259
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:45,162
Well... U-Gin and numbers.

260
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,079
- U-Gin, what did you do?
- I'm sorry, guys.

261
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:50,367
They seem tough. Why not use that?

262
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:51,929
Why get our hands dirty?

263
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:55,754
And what if this bitch lied to us?
Gabriel will come and kill us all.

264
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:57,301
Let's be smart.

265
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Good.

266
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:12,107
Listen up, you clowns.

267
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:14,629
This chick here...

268
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,531
who's sobbing so sweetly...

269
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:21,952
is Gabriel's wife.

270
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:25,972
She told us something very interesting.

271
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:27,830
- Gabriel who?
- Shut up.

272
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,780
Don't you read the papers?

273
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:33,037
He's in all the headlines...

274
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:35,702
He thinks he is the
Tony Montana of Berlin.

275
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,320
This Gabriel has a safe full of cool shit.

276
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:40,457
And we want this cool shit.

277
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:44,904
<i> Yes, Gabriel and his cool shit. </i>

278
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:49,526
<i> For 20 years I'd been trying
to put this guy behind bars. </i>

279
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:53,539
<i> For 20 years this cool shit
has prevented that. </i>

280
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:58,033
<i> In his safe was a whole archive
of compromising documents </i>

281
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,857
<i> that he used to control
his "business partners". </i>

282
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:07,311
<i> Bankers, businessmen,
politicians, prosecutors, etc. </i>

283
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,536
<i> Whether he bought them
or blackmailed them, </i>

284
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,183
<i> everything went into that safe. </i>

285
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:15,238
<i> And those who weren't willing
to play along... well </i>

286
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,424
<i> One thing was clear... </i>

287
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:21,489
<i> The safe would give
anyone great power. </i>

288
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,980
<i> But even though nobody knew about it, </i>

289
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:27,124
<i> Gabriel didn't just hide it
in his bedroom, </i>

290
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:31,099
<i> but at a secret location
somewhere in the city. </i>

291
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,629
<i> But his wife Victoria
or his brother Aleksey... </i>

292
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,773
<i> had to help him if he was arrested. </i>

293
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,358
<i> For that, they needed access
to the archive. </i>

294
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:44,885
<i> Because the paranoid bastard
didn't even want to tell them... </i>

295
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,261
<i> he created a system. </i>

296
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:51,804
<i> He spread the coordinates
and the safe combinations... </i>

297
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:54,429
<i> over several secret locations
that he controlled. </i>

298
00:27:56,173 --> 00:28:00,493
<i> To find the safe, you had to go
from one clue to the next. </i>

299
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:06,047
<i> He only told his wife and brother
the first location. </i>

300
00:28:06,696 --> 00:28:10,496
<i> That way he was prepared
for emergencies... </i>

301
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:13,277
<i> and he made sure
nobody could get near it... </i>

302
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:15,938
<i> without him knowing immediately. </i>

303
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,421
Want to know where you come in?

304
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:21,603
- Not really.
- Shut up.

305
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:25,128
You will get me this cool shit.

306
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,879
- We won't do shit for you.
- I said shut up.

307
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:41,588
Is he gonna be a daddy?

308
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:44,028
So sweet.

309
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:48,177
A real daddy?

310
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,701
- You're gonna be a father?
- I've been trying to tell you.

311
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,725
Fuck.

312
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:01,215
To add drama,
we'll keep him here.

313
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:06,165
You do the job,
then you'll get your daddy back.

314
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:08,162
Cool deal, huh?

315
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:14,449
If our sweet little bitch
hasn't lied to us

316
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:17,074
there are four locations in the city.

317
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:19,459
At each location,
part of the combination is hidden...

318
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:21,879
as well as a clue to the next location.

319
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,559
Like some fucking treasure hunt.

320
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:30,024
On that paper are some numbers.
They're called coordinates.

321
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:32,775
Fascinating things.

322
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:36,693
This is location no.1.

323
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,250
How do we know
you're not having us on?

324
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:41,689
Sweetie...

325
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:46,324
you will have to take that risk.

326
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:49,562
- Man, we won't...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

327
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:58,434
You've got until 8am tomorrow.
If you don't make it by then...

328
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,847
he eats a bullet.
If you talk to the police...

329
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:03,192
he eats a bullet.

330
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:07,871
And if you ask one more stupid question...

331
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:09,984
he eats a bullet.

332
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:12,495
Go.

333
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:24,869
- I wouldn't do that, big guy.
- What you gonna do about it?

334
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,968
You don't wanna know.

335
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:34,318
Stop that shit.

336
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:36,438
Piss off already.

337
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:39,194
Okay.

338
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:44,632
"Come on, Cha, this one last time."

339
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,347
Nice casting!
I hope you're satisfied.

340
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:50,985
- What do we do?
- Go to the cops, of course.

341
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:54,315
Didn't you listen?
Then Phong is fucked.

342
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,380
Got a better idea, Cobretti?

343
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:57,975
We do what we gotta do
and get it over with.

344
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,245
Hello, McFly, anybody home?
They're gangsters, don't trust them.

345
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,470
- Do we have a choice?
- I'm not risking Phong's life...

346
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,063
so you can play Rambo.

347
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:09,418
- It's not a movie!
- What movie?

348
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:11,282
Where is that loser Boris?

349
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:16,038
Do something useful for a change.

350
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:18,832
Keep an eye on those guys.

351
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:22,293
Can is right.
They'll be watching us.

352
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:25,599
If we don't comply,
they'll find out and kill Phong.

353
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:30,303
- That's what I'm saying.
- Boys, believe me, we're making a huge mistake.

354
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:32,504
We need a car.
That way we'll go faster.

355
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:35,063
Where do we get one?
Want to steal one?

356
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,973
U-Gin, nice work.

357
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,819
Easy, wasn't it?

358
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:15,903
Come on, bro.

359
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,250
Great.

360
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:23,251
U-Gin, if you want to get going,
now is the perfect time.

361
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,033
My car!

362
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:39,327
That went well.
He'll call the cops.

363
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:42,711
We're collecting those clues
and that's all.

364
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:46,648
- We're running an errand.
- Delivering pizza?

365
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:49,548
- Did I reverse the number?
- Guys, chill.

366
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:51,465
Where do we go first?

367
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,119
- It's a cafe in Kreuzberg.
- Anything else?

368
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:58,585
The info is engraved
on the handle of a...

369
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:01,053
dagger?

370
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:07,279
1. BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE ISTANBUL

371
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:10,363
WE CLEAN UP

372
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,488
CLÜB for Members Only

373
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:24,953
- What's a "clüb"?
- It's meant to say "club".

374
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,382
They want to be left alone.

375
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:31,343
I'm gonna go in there,
play brother and that's it.

376
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,868
Trust me.

377
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:50,087
You don't get along
with your brothers that well, huh?

378
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:54,161
- Leave it to your manager.
- You want to go in?

379
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:56,236
You could try and play sister.

380
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:58,046
Watch and learn.

381
00:34:03,395 --> 00:34:04,915
Yo.

382
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:07,218
What do you want, doofus?

383
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:09,704
Seems to be working.

384
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,464
- He hasn't copped it yet.
- That guy who was just in here...

385
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:18,184
says you're all fat, ugly sons of bitches.

386
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,580
Wait, wait.
That's not all. The best is coming.

387
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:28,053
The chink that's with him
said he fucked all your mothers.

388
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:29,566
Yours...

389
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,360
Maybe he's not such a bad manager.

390
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:32,264
yours...

391
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:33,329
My words exactly

392
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,680
Not yours,
but yours twice.

393
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:42,997
You know what, Cha?
I've always believed in him.

394
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,135
You're dead, you bastards!

395
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,800
- Shit!
- Fuck!

396
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:53,508
Sons of donkeys?

397
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,815
Fuck it.

398
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,780
It worked!

399
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,725
Shit!

400
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:17,485
- He's a crap manager!
- Shut up and run.

401
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:43,979
That way!

402
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:55,001
- What's up?
- Why are we running away?

403
00:35:55,128 --> 00:35:56,767
Don't make trouble, man.

404
00:35:58,238 --> 00:35:59,198
Come back.

405
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:04,908
Boys, get lost.

406
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:06,769
You better watch yourself.

407
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:16,170
Son of a dog. Get him.

408
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:17,417
Fuck!

409
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:33,269
- Move over, I'm driving.
- What's wrong? Chill man.

410
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,919
- What the hell did you tell them?
- Me? Not a thing.

411
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,030
Kopp.

412
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:53,989
Got it.

413
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:56,737
What's going on?

414
00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:58,719
Work to do. Kreuzberg.

415
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:02,588
Hey, wait for me!

416
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,033
Yeah, what?

417
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:16,917
All right.

418
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,718
You're lucky.
Your boys are making progress.

419
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,980
POLICE

420
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:34,708
Thanks for calling.

421
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,476
- I thought it might interest you.
- What does he mean?

422
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,761
That's Gabriel's cafe.

423
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:43,626
A neighbour reported a brawl
with the guys from the cafe.

424
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:48,707
The witnesses didn't see much.
The guys in there aren't very talkative.

425
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:59,341
<i> Why wasn't Gabriel up on that? </i>

426
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,499
<i> He had other things on his mind. </i>

427
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:07,567
<i> His brother Aleksey recently died
under mysterious circumstances. </i>

428
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:14,212
<i> Gabriel treated him
to a nice new home six feet under. </i>

429
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,780
<i> Since women are as welcom at gangster
funerals as they are at a papal election... </i>

430
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,580
<i> Gabriel had not yet noticed
the kidnapping of his wife Victoria. </i>

431
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:36,972
Yes?

432
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,110
Three guys, you say?

433
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:43,589
You got beaten up by three guys,
you losers?

434
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,711
What did they want?
You don't know?

435
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:50,048
Let me tell you what I know...

436
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:52,148
If Gabriel hears about it...

437
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:54,493
he'll beat the shit out of you.

438
00:39:55,298 --> 00:40:00,458
<i> And without knowing it,
Lionid made a very dumb decision. </i>

439
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,359
You're lucky he doesn't
have time for your shit today.

440
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,409
Losers...

441
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:17,197
Three guys, you say?

442
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,193
Interesting.

443
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,491
Somebody is in excellent form.

444
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,565
And has unfinished business
with Gabriel.

445
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:39,842
They'll give you hell if you
don't forget this Gabriel thing.

446
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:42,641
And me too, by the way.

447
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:52,549
What I don't understand...

448
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:58,266
What kind of idiots
want to mess with Gabriel?

449
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:01,632
That went well, huh?

450
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:04,380
Well? Now we have to pick street fights.

451
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,940
Live for something or die for something .
You decide, Cha.

452
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:13,373
Are you nuts?
Couldn't you just take a picture?

453
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,768
We're carrying a clue to Gabriel safe.

454
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:17,921
Better safe than sorry.

455
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:21,406
Besides, be glad we're doing so well.

456
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:24,611
HEATER

457
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:29,912
Piece of crap!

458
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:33,867
Everything all right, boys?
Need a hand?

459
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:37,865
- Good with cars?
- Well he is.

460
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:41,752
- Let me see.
- It won't start.

461
00:41:42,352 --> 00:41:44,952
Let's see. I think it's the alternator.

462
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:46,216
Let's push-start it.

463
00:41:48,013 --> 00:41:49,413
Put some effort into it.

464
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:52,534
Okay, guys.

465
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,613
A bit faster.

466
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:57,354
Faster.

467
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,409
Little more still.

468
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,747
Hang in there. More.

469
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:04,262
Yeah!

470
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:12,272
Mum's Food Joint

471
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:20,944
I've always thought
I'd die on duty.

472
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:24,140
Looks like the cholesterol
will get me first.

473
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:28,895
- When did you join?
- 20 years ago.

474
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,609
Lousy pay, no time for family...

475
00:42:33,923 --> 00:42:35,323
my dream job.

476
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:37,287
I know.

477
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:42,940
At some point you're not even surprised
that you've slept at the office again.

478
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:45,558
What does Mrs Kopp say to that?

479
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:48,358
Mrs Kopp...

480
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:52,072
She's been called Dombrowski again
for five years.

481
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:57,683
Didn't she want a three-way with Gabriel?

482
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,099
- Toilet?
- Out of order.

483
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:19,515
2. RED HEAT

484
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:26,223
Wait.
You're not getting in like that.

485
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:28,643
- Why not?
- This is a place with style.

486
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:31,347
- What?
- Can, you'd better wait outside then.

487
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,640
Tie is compulsory.

488
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:39,114
Give me yours.

489
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:02,219
Your shades are fucking annoying.
It's like a dick on your face.

490
00:44:02,479 --> 00:44:05,240
Better a dick on the face
than no dick at all, Minnie Mouse.

491
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,237
Guys, the next clue is a heater.

492
00:44:08,478 --> 00:44:09,678
Let's check.

493
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,403
Hey guys, how about
a nice bottle of Petrus?

494
00:44:20,428 --> 00:44:22,028
We're sticking to beer.

495
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:24,120
It's pretty boring here.

496
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:25,985
- We should head.
- Right.

497
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,559
- Stay for a while.
- No, we're hitting it.

498
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:31,937
Ciao.

499
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,600
Guys.

500
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:40,848
This place has no fucking heater.

501
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,959
Great. What now?

502
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:44,762
Let's check that door.

503
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:51,073
Shit!

504
00:44:56,834 --> 00:44:58,155
Let's go

505
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:04,310
Can and I go in.
You go to the bar and keep watch.

506
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,464
Enjoy it. Have one for me.

507
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:31,711
Not bad.

508
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,270
Want to have a contest?

509
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:46,539
Looks like I won.

510
00:45:47,776 --> 00:45:49,456
You're a natural...

511
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:54,042
I can do alot of things
with my mouth...

512
00:45:58,165 --> 00:45:59,565
Champagne.

513
00:46:14,312 --> 00:46:15,472
Got anything?

514
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,310
Nothing.

515
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:20,757
Fuck, that's hot.

516
00:46:22,623 --> 00:46:23,984
Can you help me?

517
00:46:31,297 --> 00:46:32,777
You're the sickness, I'm...

518
00:46:32,897 --> 00:46:34,178
Yo!

519
00:46:38,106 --> 00:46:39,386
Damn it.

520
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:45,453
Okay, I've got it.

521
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:48,439
Nice stuff.

522
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:52,431
- Can you dance?
- Can I dance?

523
00:48:15,177 --> 00:48:17,426
- Looks good.
- Yeah.

524
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:21,267
I told you there's no toilet here.

525
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,920
Sorry.

526
00:48:35,011 --> 00:48:36,731
What's your name?

527
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:41,332
And one to the right, and...

528
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,639
Did you have to ask her name?

529
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:52,999
Don't you see how hot she looks?

530
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,905
What's going on?

531
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,731
We're getting thrashed by a woman.

532
00:50:02,147 --> 00:50:05,490
- I haven't got serious yet. You?
- Not yet.

533
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:10,443
Want some more, you wannabes?

534
00:50:10,735 --> 00:50:12,175
She looks angry.

535
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,000
She's beautiful when she's angry

536
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:47,527
What kinda group sex is that?!

537
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:54,755
Okay, you wanted it this way.

538
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:57,315
Three, two, one.

539
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:00,431
The bill, please.

540
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:02,388
Come back, you...

541
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:04,546
That's mine.

542
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,580
Bastards.

543
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:08,193
Mind your step.

544
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:13,502
It's okay.

545
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,053
Taxi.

546
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,299
Get out.

547
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:26,284
- Well, cuties, where do you want to go?
- Just drive.

548
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:33,767
At least give back the ties, you jerks.

549
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:38,327
You bastards.

550
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:40,911
Fucking hell, we're out of beer.

551
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:45,181
- You morons forgot to stock up.
- We can go to the gas station.

552
00:51:45,308 --> 00:51:48,308
I'll do it myself.
You always buy that mixed shit.

553
00:51:51,663 --> 00:51:53,743
- Hey, I've got to piss.
- Tie a knot in it.

554
00:51:54,218 --> 00:51:57,298
- I can piss right here if you want.
- You're pissing me off.

555
00:51:58,613 --> 00:52:00,653
Take that sissy to the loo.

556
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:02,670
Great.

557
00:52:09,907 --> 00:52:11,075
How can I do it like this?

558
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,939
Or do you want to hold it?
You'll need both hands.

559
00:52:21,177 --> 00:52:22,897
I can't when someone's watching.

560
00:52:23,146 --> 00:52:25,706
- What?
- I can't when someone's watching.

561
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:29,321
Are you shitting me?
Think I want to see your dick?

562
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:31,354
Don't try to fuck with me, idiot.

563
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:45,724
You wanker, I'll get you.

564
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:48,758
Don't think you'll get away
with fucking me over.

565
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:06,375
Look!

566
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:39,167
Stop! Whoa!

567
00:54:42,568 --> 00:54:44,288
Stop! Stop!

568
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:45,832
Cool!

569
00:54:45,857 --> 00:54:48,138
Thanks.
You won't belive this...

570
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,214
I already know this story.

571
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,361
And the ending is pretty shitty.

572
00:54:54,528 --> 00:54:55,928
Fuck!

573
00:55:38,236 --> 00:55:39,636
To Aleksey!

574
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:01,645
If you would come with me now, please.

575
00:56:14,044 --> 00:56:18,524
Oh shit.
I hate these dogs.

576
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,802
What? That's good luck.

577
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:23,999
- Maybe you're heading for good times.
- Funny.

578
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:27,003
That's also one of Gabriel's joints, isn't it?

579
00:56:28,071 --> 00:56:29,911
- Coincidence?
- I don't think so.

580
00:56:30,712 --> 00:56:34,272
Somebody is systematically
trying to piss Gabriel off.

581
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:37,178
A rival?

582
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:40,818
I can't imagine
anyone being so dumb.

583
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:46,017
Plus...

584
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:51,563
Plus what?

585
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,347
Gabriel has a lot of enemies,
everywhere.

586
00:56:58,013 --> 00:57:00,413
Despite that, the bastard
seems to be untouchable.

587
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:05,198
So he has a lot of them
by the balls, or he bought them.

588
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:10,984
And these assholes are sitting around
watching his back.

589
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:15,046
They're sitting around here, too.

590
00:57:15,783 --> 00:57:18,624
You mean Gabriel's meddling
in our stuff?

591
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:21,968
Why do you think my case
went down the drain?

592
00:57:23,847 --> 00:57:26,407
Why did it even go to trial, then?

593
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:31,531
When they arrested Gabriel's brother...

594
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:34,311
for a minor offence, I nabbed him.
Pathetic wimp.

595
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:37,077
Not at all like Gabriel.

596
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:42,274
I told him what they do
to handsome boys like him in prison.

597
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:44,509
And then I had him.

598
00:57:48,462 --> 00:57:51,262
I had him ready to testify
against his own brother.

599
00:57:52,423 --> 00:57:54,543
Gabriel's brother? Really?

600
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:00,713
Well... A chance like that
comes up once in a lifetime.

601
00:58:23,192 --> 00:58:24,272
Yes?

602
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,148
<i> To fuck up. Verb, transitive. </i>

603
00:58:28,407 --> 00:58:33,807
Definition: to conclude something without success;
to execute a task extremely badly...

604
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,539
Not telling Gabriel in time
that three guys are trashing his joints.

605
00:58:47,092 --> 00:58:49,692
I'm glad we've been able
to reach an agreement.

606
00:58:59,796 --> 00:59:04,636
In the Middle Ages,
the bearer of bad news was often beheaded.

607
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:06,280
Pretty excessive.

608
00:59:06,578 --> 00:59:09,297
I wonder what they did if,
in addition,

609
00:59:09,908 --> 00:59:13,188
the bad news was delivered too late?

610
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:21,642
Remind me
to look that up sometime.

611
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,228
I'd really like to know.

612
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:30,908
You're sure it's the same three guys?

613
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:34,527
Yes... and that pig
is snooping around again.

614
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:36,957
Kopp?

615
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:39,645
The guy is a real bloodhound.

616
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:44,078
Let him do the dirty work,
so he's busy.

617
00:59:44,692 --> 00:59:46,052
Okay.

618
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:50,725
And? What now?

619
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:52,997
Well...

620
00:59:53,801 --> 00:59:57,448
It looks like only two guys
can keep up with Gabriel.

621
00:59:58,698 --> 01:00:00,218
God and Superman.

622
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:03,511
So you don't have a clue.

623
01:00:04,088 --> 01:00:05,449
No, Schulz.

624
01:00:05,938 --> 01:00:08,177
I don't have a goddamn fucking clue.

625
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:15,046
- Have you ever thought about quitting?
- Yeah.

626
01:00:15,964 --> 01:00:19,404
As soon as Gabriel is thrown into
the deepest shithole on the planet.

627
01:00:22,422 --> 01:00:25,342
And that shithole
into an even deeper shithole.

628
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:31,517
Yes?

629
01:00:31,614 --> 01:00:33,415
The three guys you're looking for...

630
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,137
I know where they'll turn up next.

631
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:42,978
But you won't tell me who you are?

632
01:00:52,526 --> 01:00:55,606
Someone wants to serve us
our three guys on a platter.

633
01:00:57,649 --> 01:00:59,208
Let's go, then.

634
01:01:02,112 --> 01:01:07,832
3. THRILLER NIGHT

635
01:01:15,886 --> 01:01:19,206
- Keep the change.
- Thanks. Isn't it too late for a visit?

636
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:22,894
Take my card and give me a call
if you need me later.

637
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,234
What visit?

638
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:32,902
Okay, the next hint is
"Frederick Krueger".

639
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:34,471
Who the hell is that?

640
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:36,298
No idea.

641
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:39,007
But he must be
somewhere beyond this wall.

642
01:01:46,232 --> 01:01:47,952
How do we get him over?

643
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:03,393
- Cha, Cha.
- Lift it up.

644
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,695
Cha. Cha, I love you.

645
01:02:06,795 --> 01:02:08,075
Where is Can?

646
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:10,199
Be quiet.

647
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,650
You're my bros.

648
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:15,301
I know, but you stay here
and shut your mouth, okay?

649
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:18,674
I'm sorry, guys.
I've been a shitty manager.

650
01:02:19,662 --> 01:02:22,301
Yeah, that's true.

651
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,704
From now on I'll get you
the best jobs, okay?

652
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:29,769
If you shut your trap now,
you still get to be our manager.

653
01:02:29,825 --> 01:02:31,185
- Okay?
- Okay.

654
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:35,677
- You guys are the best.
- Thanks.

655
01:02:35,832 --> 01:02:37,872
You do this kung fu stuff and all...

656
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:41,582
Bruce Lee, I can do nothing
against you.

657
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:43,935
Lick my tiny yellow balls.

658
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,260
Fuck, man. I hate cemeteries.

659
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:16,003
Stop feeling me up.
Are you scared?

660
01:03:16,274 --> 01:03:17,913
What? Never.

661
01:03:20,459 --> 01:03:21,859
I gotta piss.

662
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:30,705
Ever heard those ghost stories?

663
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,694
What ghost stories?

664
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,970
The one about the White woman
at the cemetery.

665
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:38,179
She drags people
into the graves at night.

666
01:03:38,204 --> 01:03:39,404
You're shitting me.

667
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:42,229
When have I ever done that?
She's real, man.

668
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,210
Shit. Back there.

669
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,311
- What, where?
- Over there.

670
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:49,327
I can't see anything.

671
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:56,122
Ha, ha, very funny.

672
01:03:56,276 --> 01:03:58,716
You fell for it. Ah shit.

673
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,842
- Look, the gravestone.
- Shit.

674
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,390
Search it.

675
01:04:05,627 --> 01:04:07,227
The clue should be around here.

676
01:04:10,808 --> 01:04:12,609
Are you done? Can we go now?

677
01:04:14,961 --> 01:04:16,064
19 BUDDHA STATUE

678
01:04:16,237 --> 01:04:17,317
Got it.

679
01:04:37,566 --> 01:04:39,526
Where's U-Gin?
Wasn't he here?

680
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:43,452
- How will we find him in the dark?
- No idea.

681
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,865
Maybe if he smiles.

682
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,540
Fuck, what was that?

683
01:04:47,618 --> 01:04:49,898
No idea, man.
But it came from back there.

684
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:52,121
- Go and look.
- Go look for yourself.

685
01:05:38,037 --> 01:05:39,997
Untie him, you goddamn freaks.

686
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:16,633
Those are my bros coming for me.

687
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:28,146
Are you done?

688
01:06:45,855 --> 01:06:50,454
Cha and Can. My bros.

689
01:06:50,479 --> 01:06:53,159
I love you, guys.

690
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:03,109
Shit. What the hell is that?

691
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:16,758
I think he wants you.

692
01:07:29,259 --> 01:07:30,579
Shit!

693
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:34,489
Holy shit.

694
01:07:34,605 --> 01:07:38,445
- Man, kick his ass.
- If he wants some, I'll give him some.

695
01:07:50,284 --> 01:07:51,684
Hey Cha!
You can't do shit.

696
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,101
- Come on, Cha!
- Come on.

697
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:41,809
Give'em hell.

698
01:09:10,639 --> 01:09:12,359
I thought this guy was hardcore.

699
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,631
You're the last pussy.

700
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:16,872
Yeah, let's get
the black bloc anarchists back.

701
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,113
No. If you want the hardcore guys
we have to get the Young Conservatives.

702
01:09:30,482 --> 01:09:35,322
I told you the stories
about the white woman were true.

703
01:09:35,687 --> 01:09:37,383
Wasn't that a guy?

704
01:09:37,592 --> 01:09:39,271
What the hell, man?

705
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:41,765
Can we get outta here, please?

706
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:43,641
I think he liked you.

707
01:09:44,048 --> 01:09:45,928
You're so damn funny.

708
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:47,653
You've got a nice butt, though.

709
01:09:58,816 --> 01:10:01,455
Pull yourself together
or someone will call the cops.

710
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:08,442
Well, guys...

711
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:12,479
having fun?

712
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:39,394
Listen up, you clowns.

713
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:42,677
This tour de fuck-up of yours...

714
01:10:43,842 --> 01:10:45,682
might have won you some fans.

715
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:48,270
But you've broken some laws.

716
01:10:50,873 --> 01:10:53,072
24 cases of assault and battery.

717
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:57,242
Property damage. Car theft.

718
01:10:59,675 --> 01:11:01,955
And your mummies
won't like this one...

719
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:04,896
You didn't pay
for the bubbly at the strip club.

720
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:14,004
So let's be clear.
We can put your asses in jail.

721
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:16,640
So how about you start singing?

722
01:11:21,732 --> 01:11:24,545
# Two is not alone. #

723
01:11:26,706 --> 01:11:28,626
Okay.
Separate interrogations.

724
01:11:29,675 --> 01:11:32,155
Spit it out. What was
your business at the cemetery?

725
01:11:32,644 --> 01:11:35,883
- What about the strip club?
- And those thugs at the cafe?

726
01:11:36,186 --> 01:11:39,666
Are there just three of you?
Who are you working for?

727
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:42,501
What do you know about Gabriel?

728
01:11:44,545 --> 01:11:45,545
Hello.

729
01:11:48,086 --> 01:11:51,806
Hi, brother. You look mean.
Your arms are... good.

730
01:11:52,228 --> 01:11:53,868
Do you work out?

731
01:11:55,676 --> 01:11:59,467
Solly, me no speak German.
Me no from here.

732
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:03,504
That's a good-looking beard.
Trimmed. Sweet.

733
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,942
Me get up from bed,
call Can in telephone.

734
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:10,456
And your partner
totally looks like Al Pacino.

735
01:12:14,337 --> 01:12:18,177
Me no fight. No like hurt.

736
01:12:18,379 --> 01:12:22,019
Do you know those guys
"Starsky & Hutch"?

737
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,920
Know them?

738
01:12:25,118 --> 01:12:26,318
Not from here.

739
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:51,200
Hey... did I tell you
I'm having trouble sleeping?

740
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:54,151
That's why I stay up all night now.

741
01:12:56,942 --> 01:13:00,502
I'm having trouble with the old lady.
I'll be staying here.

742
01:13:03,935 --> 01:13:05,496
We've got all night.

743
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,352
We've got all night.

744
01:13:12,566 --> 01:13:14,606
But you don't, right?

745
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,960
Your crusade against Gabriel
started today, whatever the reason.

746
01:13:23,647 --> 01:13:24,962
Mine has been going for 20 years.

747
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,380
You and I,
we want the same thing, don't we?

748
01:13:36,046 --> 01:13:37,727
All right, I'll tell you everything.

749
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:59,753
Okay, let's not waste anytime.
Send the SWAT team.

750
01:14:06,445 --> 01:14:09,565
- God, my head.
- Shit!

751
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,116
What do we do now?

752
01:14:12,886 --> 01:14:15,366
Hey, Cha.
Did you tell them anything?

753
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:19,341
- I told them where the casting office is.
- You what?

754
01:14:20,768 --> 01:14:22,688
Did you think
you could fuck me over?

755
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:32,282
Yeah, what?
Where are you?

756
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:36,427
The cops?
And why didn't you call earlier?

757
01:14:37,249 --> 01:14:40,809
You wanted to wait till the boys
left the station, you fuckwit?

758
01:14:44,139 --> 01:14:48,270
If you come here again,
I'll thrash you...

759
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:50,051
you filthy son of a bitch!

760
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:55,498
- Guys, we've got to get outta here.

761
01:14:55,587 --> 01:14:57,932
- What about these two?
- Shit!

762
01:15:02,548 --> 01:15:04,910
- Shoot them then go.
- Hey, boss.

763
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:08,670
- I'll take care of it.
- Even better.

764
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:17,124
Hands up!

765
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:38,551
Chill out. I told them
where the casting was...

766
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:40,532
- not where Phong is.
- Huh?

767
01:15:47,906 --> 01:15:49,666
What the hell is this? Huh?

768
01:15:50,276 --> 01:15:51,755
Who called you?

769
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,496
Get out of here, you morons!

770
01:15:55,745 --> 01:15:57,705
You're messing up the floor!

771
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,575
I just mopped it!

772
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:02,202
Idiots! You're morons!

773
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:05,974
Why?
The cops might've saved Phong.

774
01:16:07,037 --> 01:16:08,166
I don't think so.

775
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:11,727
When I told those two about Gabriel,
I knew they got all antsy.

776
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:14,520
They didn't care about Phong.

777
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:16,837
Everybody just wants that safe.

778
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:28,911
Oh, Eddie.

779
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:32,395
Didn't you ever wonder who might have
heard about Gabriel's safe?

780
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:37,073
Think it was by chance
that my new partner...

781
01:16:37,437 --> 01:16:39,390
suggested kidnapping me...

782
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:43,290
on the one day that Gabriel
would be at the funeral?

783
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:46,568
You've been lying to me
the whole time, you jerk!

784
01:16:48,726 --> 01:16:52,406
But when you found some suckers
you could blackmail into doing your work.

785
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:56,264
I was surprised, to put it mildly.
Maybe even impressed.

786
01:16:57,867 --> 01:17:00,627
But you see... Eddie...

787
01:17:02,515 --> 01:17:04,156
you are my sucker.

788
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,913
Then again, it's not your fault.

789
01:17:09,853 --> 01:17:12,494
Your brain seems to be
even smaller than your dick.

790
01:17:12,905 --> 01:17:14,745
I swear to you, you bitch...

791
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,570
if I ever lay my hands on you...

792
01:17:17,827 --> 01:17:20,186
I'll slice off your tits...

793
01:17:20,211 --> 01:17:23,171
and feed them to the troll
that shat out your grandma!

794
01:17:23,426 --> 01:17:24,586
Shut up.

795
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:28,954
What about this one?

796
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:39,222
How can they get the codes
if we have the dagger?

797
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,470
Okay.

798
01:17:40,563 --> 01:17:42,163
They need Phong alive.

799
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,485
We might still need him.

800
01:17:53,727 --> 01:17:54,847
So what now?

801
01:17:55,289 --> 01:17:56,461
I haven't thought about that yet.

802
01:17:57,164 --> 01:17:58,684
Guys...

803
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:03,024
This whole time we were chasing
the hottest jobs and the big money.

804
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:06,991
I know what you can do.
This time it's not about money or fame.

805
01:18:08,374 --> 01:18:11,134
It's about helping our brother,
getting together again.

806
01:18:11,266 --> 01:18:13,907
But we don't have
the fourth part of the combination yet.

807
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:17,571
Guys, we're family, right?

808
01:18:19,156 --> 01:18:20,156
Besides...

809
01:18:21,812 --> 01:18:23,812
problems are there to be solved.

810
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,477
- For Phong.
- For Phong.

811
01:18:31,324 --> 01:18:32,723
For Phong.

812
01:18:40,524 --> 01:18:41,924
Yeah?

813
01:18:46,499 --> 01:18:48,379
Thanks for the heads-up.

814
01:18:50,483 --> 01:18:51,922
They tricked us.

815
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:55,768
Those boys are not as dumb as they look.

816
01:19:00,717 --> 01:19:06,358
4. LITTLE BUDDHA

817
01:19:16,728 --> 01:19:18,529
- Dude, I've got to puke.
- Again?

818
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:21,011
Yeah, I'm fucked.

819
01:19:21,641 --> 01:19:24,401
- Okay, we'll go on ahead.
- I'll catch up.

820
01:19:30,942 --> 01:19:32,142
Fuck!

821
01:19:33,441 --> 01:19:34,458
Hello?

822
01:19:37,411 --> 01:19:38,690
All right.

823
01:19:39,809 --> 01:19:41,802
We're on our way.

824
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:48,599
Sorry.

825
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,717
My wife always worries
when I'm gone for the night.

826
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:55,796
We'll get to the bottom of this now.

827
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:00,214
Let's take the back entrance.

828
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:08,169
How do we find a Buddha statue here?

829
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:11,518
No idea. Start looking.

830
01:20:29,065 --> 01:20:30,305
Let me handle this.

831
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:32,660
You want to play the brother now?

832
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,460
Thank you for your welcome.

833
01:20:37,896 --> 01:20:40,335
We wouldn't bother you
if it wasn't really important.

834
01:20:40,982 --> 01:20:42,542
We're Archaeology students...

835
01:20:43,365 --> 01:20:45,966
and we'd like to see your Buddha statue.

836
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:50,466
We're writing a thesis
on the Imperial period,

837
01:20:50,786 --> 01:20:53,627
when the emperors were alive, etc.

838
01:20:55,513 --> 01:20:57,873
Anyway,
we're very interested in your culture...

839
01:20:58,529 --> 01:21:00,849
as it's more than 100 years old.

840
01:21:13,678 --> 01:21:14,928
What's she saying?

841
01:21:15,513 --> 01:21:16,659
No idea.

842
01:21:16,723 --> 01:21:18,484
I'm Korean.
You should know that by now.

843
01:21:19,419 --> 01:21:22,271
- What kind of Asian are you?
- Don't know.

844
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:24,971
Okay. Plan B?

845
01:21:25,629 --> 01:21:26,949
What?

846
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,920
- You can't do this.
- Sure I can.
88 GARDEN ALLOTMENT

847
01:21:37,117 --> 01:21:38,437
Quick work, eh?

848
01:21:39,987 --> 01:21:41,628
Archaeology students?

849
01:21:43,059 --> 01:21:44,179
Really?

850
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:50,104
- Oh!
- Shit!

851
01:22:35,892 --> 01:22:36,932
Come on.

852
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,169
Shit.

853
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:53,242
Hey, I've got something for you.

854
01:22:59,193 --> 01:23:00,433
You got it going on.

855
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,160
Here, I didn't even need them.

856
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:38,549
Not any more maybe.

857
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:45,695
Phong?

858
01:24:00,746 --> 01:24:04,888
You guys have got something I want.

859
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:07,362
Huh?

860
01:24:07,424 --> 01:24:09,264
She's after the goddamn safe too.

861
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,085
Your decision.

862
01:24:23,717 --> 01:24:29,438
You still don't get it,
you're way out of your depth.

863
01:24:34,146 --> 01:24:35,866
- Cha!
- Cha! Cha!

864
01:24:37,033 --> 01:24:39,393
- Fuck!
- Now hand over the coordinates.

865
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:47,535
Bravo.

866
01:24:47,896 --> 01:24:49,375
A grand move.

867
01:24:49,966 --> 01:24:54,966
I see you've learned to write
the rules to your own game.

868
01:24:56,684 --> 01:24:58,524
You really thought I was a pawn...

869
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,793
that you could move around
your chessboard...

870
01:25:01,998 --> 01:25:03,638
Like you did with your brother?

871
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:06,216
We have to do something
or the boys are fucked.

872
01:25:06,594 --> 01:25:08,154
Kopp, there are too many of them.

873
01:25:08,492 --> 01:25:10,252
We're responsible for them.

874
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,230
You know...

875
01:25:12,582 --> 01:25:14,062
I've always expected...

876
01:25:14,653 --> 01:25:17,733
some scumbag
to go after my archive.

877
01:25:18,677 --> 01:25:20,957
That it turned out to be you...

878
01:25:22,856 --> 01:25:24,497
is almost interesting.

879
01:25:26,607 --> 01:25:28,886
But to be honest, you bore me.

880
01:25:29,341 --> 01:25:32,221
Call for backup.
I'll try to hold them up.

881
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:33,862
This is suici...

882
01:25:34,146 --> 01:25:35,346
Police!

883
01:25:37,504 --> 01:25:39,384
Everybody stay calm.

884
01:25:47,506 --> 01:25:49,066
Now it's getting interesting.

885
01:25:50,435 --> 01:25:52,675
Did you tell her how your brother died?

886
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:55,942
What does he mean?

887
01:25:56,839 --> 01:25:59,278
Sweetie,
are you really that naive?

888
01:26:05,534 --> 01:26:08,135
Like I said, lousy pay.

889
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:14,750
Did I ever tell you how the story
with my old partner ended?

890
01:26:15,825 --> 01:26:17,825
He was a corrupt asshole,
just like you.

891
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:19,969
If you have something to say, say it.

892
01:26:20,516 --> 01:26:23,955
Did you really think Gabriel would
let my key witness...

893
01:26:24,449 --> 01:26:26,449
against him and his life?

894
01:26:33,206 --> 01:26:35,166
I guess you've lost sight of one thing.

895
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,301
This is still my game.

896
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:41,061
You've lost sight of one thing too.

897
01:26:42,622 --> 01:26:46,062
Your brother
wasn't only a better person than you...

898
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,300
he was also a better fuck.

899
01:28:19,242 --> 01:28:20,682
Take care of them!

900
01:28:25,483 --> 01:28:26,803
Phong! Get her.

901
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:29,886
Fuck!

902
01:29:52,782 --> 01:29:53,782
Kick his ass, Can!

903
01:30:45,692 --> 01:30:47,051
Shit!

904
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:21,459
I told you it was a bad idea.

905
01:33:40,403 --> 01:33:43,363
- Well? Still alive?
- I'm all right.

906
01:33:44,088 --> 01:33:46,008
- Go and help Phong.
- Sure?

907
01:33:49,237 --> 01:33:52,117
- You're okay? They went that way.
- Yeah.

908
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:02,356
Enough!

909
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,762
You look beat.

910
01:34:24,724 --> 01:34:25,972
Come on, doll.

911
01:34:31,782 --> 01:34:34,181
Phong.
What are you doing here?

912
01:34:38,098 --> 01:34:39,618
You're all so stupid.

913
01:34:44,961 --> 01:34:46,201
Over there!

914
01:34:49,854 --> 01:34:51,814
Playtime is over.

915
01:35:00,215 --> 01:35:02,855
My game, my rules.

916
01:35:03,466 --> 01:35:05,066
Fuck.

917
01:35:13,724 --> 01:35:15,804
Live for nothing or die for something.

918
01:35:16,184 --> 01:35:17,504
You decide.

919
01:35:23,606 --> 01:35:24,846
Can!

920
01:35:29,735 --> 01:35:31,376
Your move.

921
01:35:41,674 --> 01:35:44,754
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

922
01:35:47,684 --> 01:35:49,324
Yippie-ki-ay, motherfucker.

923
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,317
Are you okay, lad?

924
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:14,069
I've been better.

925
01:36:18,802 --> 01:36:20,802
The bullet went right through
don't worry.

926
01:36:22,356 --> 01:36:23,596
We've got something for you.

927
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:26,550
Phong, in her pocket.

928
01:36:28,996 --> 01:36:31,557
- Cha, you all right?
- I'm fine. You?

929
01:36:31,887 --> 01:36:33,246
Yeah.

930
01:36:36,691 --> 01:36:38,571
About time we got rid of this shit.

931
01:36:41,731 --> 01:36:43,412
These are the coordinates.

932
01:36:43,646 --> 01:36:46,327
That's garden allotments near the airport.

933
01:36:46,496 --> 01:36:49,256
There's additional info. C13.

934
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:52,090
That will be the plot number.

935
01:36:57,747 --> 01:37:00,507
Guys, there's something else
for me to do.

936
01:37:01,927 --> 01:37:03,567
I'll send someone.

937
01:37:07,919 --> 01:37:09,239
And...

938
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:13,171
good work, guys.

939
01:37:17,513 --> 01:37:19,074
<i> Think about it... </i>

940
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:23,671
<i> All this time I couldn't get hold
of this pig and his minions... </i>

941
01:37:24,426 --> 01:37:28,506
<i> and then I got a hold of Gabriel's archive. </i>

942
01:37:28,997 --> 01:37:30,436
<i> And with this archive... </i>

943
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:34,584
<i> I would bust the rest
of the corrupt slimebags. </i>

944
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:38,864
<i> If you want to know
what a happy bastard looks like... </i>

945
01:37:39,856 --> 01:37:41,696
<i> just look at me. </i>

946
01:37:42,557 --> 01:37:46,677
<i> I guess that's about it.
What can I say? </i>

947
01:37:47,245 --> 01:37:52,444
<i> After 20 years of rowing up
shit creek without a paddle... </i>

948
01:37:53,054 --> 01:37:57,734
<i> within a day these boys showed
what it all comes down to. </i>

949
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:59,750
<i> They stuck together... </i>

950
01:37:59,814 --> 01:38:02,981
<i> listened to their hearts
and stayed true to themselves. </i>

951
01:38:03,762 --> 01:38:05,201
<i> To the end. </i>

952
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,560
You didn't expect me
to quote "Die Hard", did you?

953
01:38:13,176 --> 01:38:15,637
Here, you deserve to have them back.

954
01:38:17,278 --> 01:38:22,175
Shit. Those bastards.

955
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,080
I'm so fucking hungry.

956
01:38:25,247 --> 01:38:27,686
I'd even eat kebab.

957
01:38:29,661 --> 01:38:32,661
Hey, Phong,
were you crying earlier on?

958
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:34,453
What?

959
01:38:34,644 --> 01:38:37,317
He's right.
You really had watery eyes.

960
01:38:37,589 --> 01:38:39,709
Guys, never!

961
01:38:39,816 --> 01:38:41,656
He didn't think we'd get him out.

962
01:38:42,707 --> 01:38:45,308
- Honestly, did you cry?
- Yeah, sure.

963
01:38:47,513 --> 01:38:49,114
Fuck. My battery's dead.

964
01:38:49,816 --> 01:38:51,296
So what?

965
01:38:51,965 --> 01:38:54,245
This story is our chance to get rich.

966
01:38:54,466 --> 01:38:57,434
I have to find us
a production company real quick.

967
01:38:58,488 --> 01:39:00,368
Over my dead body, man.

968
01:39:00,677 --> 01:39:03,209
What?
It can't get any worse than this.

969
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:04,633
Yeah, man, come on.

970
01:39:04,776 --> 01:39:07,708
- I'm done with this, boys
- Come on, man.

971
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:12,382
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

972
01:39:13,339 --> 01:39:16,839
Subrip and re-edited: Phntalytee

973
01:39:26,768 --> 01:39:28,728
Lick my tiny yellow balls.

974
01:39:35,442 --> 01:39:36,282
Cut.

975
01:39:36,445 --> 01:39:37,965
- Look at me.
- Oh shit!

976
01:39:40,755 --> 01:39:42,234
Cut.

977
01:39:43,135 --> 01:39:45,520
Your shades are pissing me off a...

978
01:39:45,663 --> 01:39:46,614
fuck you!

979
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:49,971
Sorry.

980
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:50,985
A little louder, please.

981
01:39:51,145 --> 01:39:52,385
Hey guys, take it easy.

982
01:39:53,801 --> 01:39:55,362
Where do we...
Where do we...

983
01:39:57,003 --> 01:39:58,524
Where do we...

984
01:40:00,872 --> 01:40:02,793
Where do we...
have to go?

985
01:40:06,692 --> 01:40:08,012
Where do we have to go?

986
01:40:09,113 --> 01:40:10,393
Why did you laugh?

987
01:40:10,576 --> 01:40:13,656
- That's my line, Can.
- Oh, sorry.

988
01:40:13,889 --> 01:40:15,328
Can's right.

989
01:40:19,052 --> 01:40:20,883
- Can we start again?
- It's rolling.

990
01:40:21,038 --> 01:40:22,158
Good.

991
01:40:22,778 --> 01:40:24,938
I mean... he's gotta chill.

992
01:40:28,206 --> 01:40:31,727
If Can keeps playing the diva...
Again please.

993
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,591
- Think I want to see your dick?
- What?

994
01:40:33,616 --> 01:40:35,176
Don't try to fuck with me. Come on.

995
01:40:37,061 --> 01:40:39,021
121-11, take 1.

996
01:40:49,394 --> 01:40:50,800
Sorry, sorry.

997
01:40:51,227 --> 01:40:53,547
If Gabriel hears about it,
he's going to...

998
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:55,722
beat the shit out of you.

999
01:40:55,747 --> 01:40:58,434
He's going to give...
He's going...

1000
01:40:58,459 --> 01:40:59,159
He'll cut you...

1001
01:40:59,549 --> 01:41:00,949
Fuck!

1002
01:41:02,086 --> 01:41:08,182
If I ever get my hands on you,
I'm going to slice off your grandma's tits.

1003
01:41:08,924 --> 01:41:10,284
On two conditions..

1004
01:41:12,954 --> 01:41:14,434
The first...

1005
01:41:15,003 --> 01:41:16,724
I forgot.

1006
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,489
Cut!

1007
01:41:30,175 --> 01:41:31,454
Shit.

1008
01:41:31,738 --> 01:41:33,058
What happened?

1009
01:41:33,339 --> 01:41:34,619
Fuck.

1010
01:41:34,965 --> 01:41:36,805
- Shit.
- Cut.

1011
01:41:41,996 --> 01:41:42,797
Action!

1012
01:41:50,635 --> 01:41:52,555
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.

1013
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,383
"You're the sickness, I'm the cure".

1014
01:41:59,719 --> 01:42:00,756
Yeah.
