1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
"Eleusis keeps always something hidden for
those that will visit her again" Seneca.

2
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:10,600
The Mourning Rock (lit. The
Rock that doens't smile)

3
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:44,115
dedicated to Dafne, Anna and Panayota.

4
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:53,990
In the age of antiquity, thousands of people
came here searching for the happiness

5
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:57,689
that was offered to them by the
participation in the Eleusinian Mysteries.

6
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:02,113
Here the adepts learned that they
can overcome the fear of death.

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,670
Today humanity without knowing anything
more about it, seek happiness elsewhere.

8
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:12,439
As for this place, those who
pass from here avert their gaze.

9
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:26,910
When I came here I knew, like everyone, the
old myth taken place in these low hills.

10
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:31,294
The myth of the abduction of Persephone, at
the hands of god of the underworld, Pluto

11
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:34,274
and the return to her mother's
side Demeter (Ceres),

12
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:36,305
made Eleusis one of
the most famous and

13
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,790
principally one of the
most sacred of places.

14
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:42,281
I even knew of the modern
reality taken place here.

15
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:45,310
And which destroyed even these hills.

16
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:50,272
I started to observe the city from
the point of view of a pilgrim.

17
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:52,296
Eleusis, May, 1988. <i>Good Luck!</i>

18
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,537
The first images.

19
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:58,415
Excavation in the field of
Papagiani Street, North Eleusis.

20
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,039
Irregular shapes, unusual
activities, unusual images.

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,323
From above, the excavation looks like
an open wound in the body of the Earth.

22
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:11,214
This site was a cemetery
in the antiquity.

23
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:15,617
Today it belongs to Mr. Tirlis and a
building is going to be built here.

24
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:18,915
As in all salvaging excavations,
here too, the images

25
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,672
coming out daily are unique
and unfortunately the last.

26
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:26,423
These existed for 2500 yrs
in the arms of the Earth,

27
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:29,714
however today, are being
driven to annihilation.

28
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:36,502
Seeing this image up close, a
feeling of discomfort ensues.

29
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:42,548
Little by little you get used to, as if
this had nothing to do with human destiny.

30
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:50,329
A currency, essential to
cross the lagoon of Acheron.

31
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,255
I encountered today, almost by chance,

32
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:01,412
him who had a secret and peculiar
relationship with all this.

33
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:05,920
His love for the ancient findings, his
figure refer us to a man from another time,

34
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:09,611
persecuted and moonstruck,
that fell into the present.

35
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:20,159
At noon, I was waiting for him on the
docks. There accross of Salamis.

36
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:23,694
Ha appeared suddenly, from the
corner of the supermarket Cronos,

37
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:28,985
And started to search among the most petty
material of this world: The rubble.

38
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:33,534
It's as he gives his own different
meaning in this summation

39
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,360
of incoherent things, that
we call everyday life.

40
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:44,400
A crazy, with a crazy relation with ancient
things, rejected by those around him.

41
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:49,557
In these incidental encounters that I
had with him, he constituted my guide.

42
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:52,859
Today the anthropomorphous larnax
(human-like coffin) was opened.

43
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,483
This type is discovered for
the first time in Αttica.

44
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:00,232
It was a custom of Asia Minor
and the Aegean islands.

45
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:13,958
So, we assume that this tall
man holding in his right hand

46
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:17,515
an iron sword, came from
these lands, from the East.

47
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:20,857
And brought with him this custom.

48
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,617
These days I met Stelios Theologou.

49
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:29,037
He also came from the East, in 1922,
as a refugee, along with many others.

50
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,561
He lives in the refugee
neighborhood, in Northern Eleusis.

51
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:35,857
With children and grandchildren, and
the photo of Plastiras in his wallet.

52
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:39,128
(second lieutenant, right-wing
politician, prime minister of Greece)

53
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:41,839
He had all the qualities
of his homeland.

54
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:46,330
Hard-working, tireless, with a tremendous
thirst for prosperity. Ionian.

55
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:34,788
I followed the milkman.

56
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,543
It's not the quaintness
what attracts me.

57
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:42,300
It's the modesty, the discretion, and
the kindness of his daily route.

58
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:46,852
He could be potentially comparisoned
with the goddess Demeter (Ceres).

59
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:50,307
That's how she came to
Eleusis, endpoint and limit to

60
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,762
her wandering to the world,
searching for Persephone.

61
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:59,496
Therefore, mr Panagiotis, is one of
those who write with their daily route

62
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,587
the word "The End" over
an epoch of the city.

63
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:10,874
A new excavation started
in the winter of '88.

64
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:14,486
It brought to light part
of an archaic cemetery

65
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,777
where mostly childern were buried.

66
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:22,435
These ancient infants, immature children
didn't grow to become handsome teenagers

67
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:27,008
like Kritios Boy, or beautiful girls
as Peploforos. (veiled one).

68
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:30,232
Their stay in this world
was desperately short.

69
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:35,526
Today we find them buried in containers,
or jar-burials in scientific terms.

70
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:42,808
Often devoid of funerary offerings and sometimes
buried with Attican or imported Corinthian pots.

71
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,757
From the type of tombs
and burial customs,

72
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,914
We surmise it to be
cemetary of common people.

73
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:23,662
A new observer was added in the
southern corner of the square,

74
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:25,995
facing the hangout of the adolescents.

75
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,303
The first installation
hapenned years ago.

76
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:32,347
In the ceremony of unveiling the sculpture
of Aeschylus in his birthplace,

77
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:34,971
the president of the Republic attended.

78
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:38,006
When the mayor changed,
the sculpture was

79
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,554
removed in order for the
square to be reformed.

80
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:42,610
Today, after he traversed
the city, he returned

81
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,951
back to his place, this
time without formalities.

82
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:50,042
With the minimum impact possible, like
Panagiotis Farmakis, or the milkman.

83
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:18,441
<i>Petrola (oil company) = DEATH.</i>

84
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:48,505
Everyone knew. Both those
participating in the manifestation,

85
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,979
and those who were stood
behind fences, like the

86
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,910
mister that received the
resolution so disreputably.

87
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,934
Everyone knew.

88
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,945
That the refinery was to be expanded.

89
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,242
Time, and especially envy, accelerated
the disintegration of this excavation.

90
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,499
Persephone Street, Spring 1988.

91
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,257
Here a part of a Roman
baths complex was found.

92
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,460
With underfloor heating,
liquid tanks and mosaic floors.

93
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,031
In the north, an ancient
well was discovered.

94
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,453
Even till this day it gushes.

95
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:35,195
It has been investigated
up to 7 meters depth.

96
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:40,290
Its constrution is exceptional, and
therefore, it was in use for many centuries.

97
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:44,366
It fell to disuse when the city was
deserted during the time of Byzantium.

98
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,397
However, the recordings
from the southwest corner

99
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:49,743
have kept us something
valuable today.

100
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,447
The image of the house next
door, with the palm tree.

101
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:56,138
Now the house has been
demolished, the palm tree sold,

102
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:59,743
and here a large building
is going to be built.

103
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:03,371
Already with the first
excavation a destruction layer

104
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,331
of the Roman times was found.

105
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:14,272
Today, since morning it was
snowing throughout Αttica,

106
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:17,496
You can barely see Salamis,
to the other shore.

107
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:20,825
Going up the Pangalou Str.,
opposite Saint George Str.,

108
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:22,582
we encountered this scene.

109
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:54,124
Towards the evening, it stopped snowing.

110
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,838
As for this work, it had
finished close to noon.

111
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:02,046
Coming back, the image
of that house whose

112
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,203
destruction we saw today
came vividly in mind.

113
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:09,789
In Piraeus, we were not
allowed to disembark.

114
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,900
And we started our way
to Eleusis, at dusk.

115
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,446
So, the place where we did disembark...

116
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,070
- Shall I point at it now?
- Yes, yes.

117
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:26,808
Exactly at this stairway, that's
what I call it, we disembarked.

118
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:32,752
And this mister, mr. Tsigkos,
who owned the factory,

119
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:36,936
illuminated with lantern,
and everyone came out.

120
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,721
Theodoros Tsigkos, who received
them alone with a lantern in hand,

121
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:44,269
was possibly the only one who
understood the magnitude

122
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,226
of the catastrophe (Asia
Minor Catastrophe)

123
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:52,396
Later, I always found
this small party

124
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,651
in the Eleftherios Venizelos
square, in Northern Eleusis.

125
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,306
They came when they
were small children,

126
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,227
they were to live the most tragic
part of the history of Greece.

127
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:06,251
They took many years to understand that
the land of lonia was definitely lost.

128
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,984
In each face the anguish of memory,

129
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:12,092
And instead of a
collective memory,

130
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:15,565
thousands memories of people
who drag their personal drama,

131
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,655
Into the great wound of history.

132
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,146
So, in this oil mill where
pomace oil was produced.

133
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:28,634
I worked ten years as a worker.
From 1925 to 1935.

134
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:33,114
And when I say that
I was a worker,

135
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:38,478
I mean the trolley was made of scantlings,
not planks and the corners were iron.

136
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,816
And it transported 109 kilos normally,

137
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:49,813
Or 167 when it was overloaded. You took
it from there and you sent it there,

138
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:53,497
at the stokehold and the stokers
were working with this.

139
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:58,962
They worked and produced
steam this huge, every year.

140
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,959
The work was very hard, because you
were carrying over your shoulder

141
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,241
from the drier one poke
weighing 90-100 kilos,

142
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:11,532
and there was a cobblestone staircase at
this side and you were climbing them.

143
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:16,532
And whether it was snowing, or it was cold,
you were barefoot and with a single shirt.

144
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:21,167
Among those ruins, you no longer hear
the monotonous sound of machines,

145
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:24,522
the labor, the toil, the
daily anguish of survival.

146
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:25,601
(russian )

147
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:35,502
It may well be the last
time we see this symbol,

148
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:39,059
it will soon be retired in
the dark side of history.

149
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:43,310
What prevails today are terms
like private initiative,

150
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:47,403
economy of the Free Market,
goods of Capitalism.

151
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,560
We will have to say many things.

152
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,746
I only want to say that mr. Panagiotis

153
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:54,977
has stopped distributing milk in the
neighborhoods of North Eleusis.

154
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,785
He told me that his horse grew old, and
it was difficult to cross the highway.

155
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,076
Later, he told me another version.

156
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,020
His children didn't let him.
Nothing is simple.

157
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:10,089
I wonder how can one prove that the city
is a bit poorer without his route.

158
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:15,010
January 16, 1991.
Much cold today.

159
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:18,363
No excavations were taken
place at the plots today.

160
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:20,643
I came across Panagiotis
Farmakis on the farmers' market.

161
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:26,380
He told me he was sick. In fact, he didn't
possess the same agility than in the past.

162
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,953
The students had a gathering and a protest
march today. Among them, the Kourou twins.

163
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:38,634
Later, they closed the National Highway,
at the height of the Steel Company.

164
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,904
In the afternoon, along with Roula, I
visited her grandfather Stelios Theologou.

165
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:47,591
The grandfather struggles
with the angel.

166
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:50,434
Entering the kitchen, I had
this sensation of abandonment.

167
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:55,280
I sensed that in the following steps I would
come up against what I could not avoid.

168
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:58,146
But the image of grandfather
was more comforting.

169
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,837
Him, still attractive, was sitting
in the chair, harmless as a child.

170
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,499
Really, how is the expectation
to be called by your own name?

171
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,656
Late at night, the Persian
Gulf War broke out.

172
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,464
<i>Great rock concert protesting against
the expansion of Petrola! (Oil company)</i>

173
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:19,555
<i>Today at 19.00 at Youth sq.
In North Eleusis!</i>

174
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:26,995
<i>Resolution against the
expansion of Petrola!</i>

175
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:32,850
A little time later, on the
initiative of the city council,

176
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,757
a referendum was held in the city on
whether or not to expand the refinery.

177
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:43,832
The results of the referundum
were: 97% against the expansion.

178
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:52,495
Afterwards, we saw with surprise those images
in the news. (mayor in cahoots with government)

179
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,655
And it came to my mind
that woman in Eleusis

180
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,262
that we saw the day
of the resolution.

181
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:38,354
The excavation in the Tirlis plot ended.

182
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,478
The last time it traversed the town,
it was about 410 B.C.

183
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:50,323
Today, in this anonymous
transport of March 31, 1989,

184
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:52,480
too few a glances gazed upon it.

185
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:56,024
As it walked down Demeter str.
a bit unorthodoxically,

186
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,648
bound to the
archaeological enclosure.

187
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,408
Today I went to to Eleusis
without any particular reason.

188
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:19,787
I search in this place that
which may partly balance

189
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:22,678
the daily routine, the
concerns, the fear.

190
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,655
Here in Aspropyrgos, I
have seen many times

191
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,055
these faces glued in this
melancholic background

192
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,961
sometimes looking right in the eyes, as
if they invited us in another world.

193
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,571
They know well that this world is
fictitious without reciprocation.

194
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:38,528
I would say it's a non-place.

195
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:43,905
Few days later, I have seen what
would be defined as non-faces.

196
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:47,619
In the Rentumi plot,
the excavation is over.

197
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:50,675
The few walls will be
preserved in the basement

198
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:53,899
for the archaelogists of
the fourth millennium.

199
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:58,626
<i>NO TO THE FIRESALE OF THE SHIPYARDS.</i>

200
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,700
In the square, a rally
of shipyard workers.

201
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:04,759
<i>[the] workers through their
mass organizations should</i>

202
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,006
<i>develop their united and
cordinarted struggle...</i>

203
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,001
Soon, Panagiotis Farmakis appeared.

204
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:14,492
He arrived as a hiker, as always.
As if a deity manifested itself.

205
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,020
I followed him to the sea.

206
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:39,055
Here! Can you carry it from the holes?

207
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:48,166
- Now I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

208
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,029
Down - Is there anything there?
May I also come?

209
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:55,720
- I have not seen anything.
- Where down? Are they digging somewhere?

210
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,848
- Will you take a picture of this?
- It's old, isn't it?

211
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:11,605
It's beautiful, yes but they didn't
take it, and it's full of tar now.

212
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:21,491
Wait, I'll come too.

213
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:23,576
With your car?

214
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Wait for me to bring it
because I've left it open.

215
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,920
- Okay, go!
- Where will I find you?

216
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,459
I wander by, aimlessly, like this.

217
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,747
The "Seven Against Thebes" Str. is
possibly the smallest road in the city.

218
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,771
It concerns only three houses.

219
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,504
However, Ms. Antonia
feels very proud to

220
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,992
live on this street, and
not without reason.

221
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:50,616
Right in front of her house the Western
Cemetery of Eleusis is located.

222
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:54,511
A clyster of graves are of
monumental construction.

223
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:57,831
And since the ancient times,
they were believed to belong to

224
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:00,983
the seven generals of Argos who
fought and died in Thebes.

225
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:05,540
According to Aeschylus, the seven
Argeian generals are buried here.

226
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:09,978
This is all that is left of the
"Western Cemetery of Eleusis" area.

227
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,688
It is a pity that the
"TITAN" cement factory.

228
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,352
Has not felt the same pride that Mrs.
Antonia

229
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:18,043
as far as the historical and
mythological aspect of the case.

230
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,297
I started as a 15,16
years old boy in '45.

231
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,470
Working on the first gig
called orbital sander.

232
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:32,046
I continued as air hammer operator and
after 2-3 years I obtain my license.

233
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:39,576
And since then I always filled the
ovens. I was an explosives technician.

234
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,666
I was here in 1946.

235
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,075
- How was this site then?
- All this was a sierra. A mountain.

236
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:55,938
Were you working on the
unit blowing up the hill?

237
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,362
Yeah, I was an air
hammer operator.

238
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:04,363
At this point, right here, there was
the tower measuring 60 meters high.

239
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:11,896
We were refugees.

240
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:15,856
My father was from Asia
Minor, my mother from Aydin,

241
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,245
my brother, who was
killed, born at Piraeus

242
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,529
and I, named Vasilis, born in Eleusis.

243
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,673
I had a father, a mother, a brother...
two brothers,

244
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:34,107
who they both died, one in Germany,
and the other close to 10 years ago,

245
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:38,198
And now I'm alone with my sister,
I do not have anyone else.

246
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:44,279
Mr. Giorgos in Sacred Street,
seems to welcome you

247
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,274
every morning upon
entering the city.

248
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:50,075
He also came, as a refugee,
with a suitcase of memories.

249
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,429
When I arrived today at the Thanou plot,

250
00:21:57,006 --> 00:22:00,798
the clay larnax (coffin) was
already open of this child.

251
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:04,569
Let us borrow for this occasion, an epigram
of Lucian, for the young Callimachus.

252
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:08,836
"As a small child, with a carefree
soul the cruel Hades grabbed me."

253
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,193
"Do not cry for me."

254
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:14,785
"My life was short, but in sufferings
of life, my share was small, too."

255
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:17,134
None of his bones were preserved.

256
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:20,891
All funerary offerings are
preserved along with an egg.

257
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,831
Excavations have started
in a new plot, north of

258
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:31,314
the Ceremonies site in
Kougioumtzoglu street.

259
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:33,938
It was a cemetery in hellenistic times.

260
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,334
Today it belongs to Mr. Dalios.

261
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:42,150
What seems to be the most interesting is
what little Argyro prefers to play with.

262
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,241
Two identical sarcophagi lids.

263
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,572
I was born in 1914.

264
00:22:58,104 --> 00:23:00,504
I was, I think about five years old,

265
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:05,525
when we were moved again as refugees,

266
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:09,611
they took us to the Middle
East, as they call it...

267
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:12,927
In Turkey where the
Armenians were slaughtered.

268
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:16,351
Where the troubles are
happening now once again.

269
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,793
It was called Aydıntepe(?), there.

270
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:22,681
As ancient history
did not mention the

271
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:25,121
craftsman who made the
big amphora of Dipulou,

272
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,361
or the pot with the representation
of the blindness of Polyphemus.

273
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:31,856
Likewise, modern history will
not quote Giorgos Krionas.

274
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,646
<i>"They had slaughtered them".</i>

275
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,767
From Thrace, from Skopos. We are
Thracians. Skopos is our village.

276
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,965
They arrived as persecuted in the difficult
years of the beggining of the century.

277
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,715
And he continued the job of his
father in the furnaces of Eleusis.

278
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:54,903
I met him in Sterna, in one of the
small houses of the neighborhood.

279
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:59,527
<i>They went to Romania, like his
father, like my father and many more.</i>

280
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:12,066
Today I went again to Eleusis, despite
not being any particular reason.

281
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,944
In the coffee shop in front
of the statue of Aeschylus,

282
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:18,726
three elders who were sitting looking
at the square spoke about death.

283
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,441
I do not remember the exact words,

284
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:23,532
But the content was
deeply human and sincere.

285
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:28,395
In the archaeological site a
preserver paid in hourly wages

286
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:30,219
was cleaning a small shell.

287
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:32,839
This vessel was broken
from the antiquity,

288
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:34,901
possibly after a dinner in
memory of the deceased.

289
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,992
This coincidence of size was a
perfect frame for the figure.

290
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:44,676
From the side I watched, I also noticed
that these two faces matched perfectly.

291
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,671
And something else important.

292
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:51,208
This shell, along with others were
discoveries of Panagiotis Farmakis,

293
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:53,917
from the building debris
of the Tirlis plot.

294
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:56,726
The event of these three
small coincidences,

295
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,750
closes a unique cycle of life.

296
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,173
Every man builds his life as a film.

297
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:10,530
This is what cinema is, in essence.

298
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:15,213
Big films put aside the films
that everyone has constructed

299
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:18,414
according to their own life
and reach to life itself.

300
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,744
This is what Christos Vakalopoulos
wrote, for Tarkovsky's films.

301
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,435
These days Christos died.

302
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:29,893
What big films achieve, nowadays I
feel happens mainly with death.

303
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:34,891
We seek in this city all these small
films each one has for his life.

304
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:37,248
Trying to find the cause of things.

305
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,487
An elementary image of the city,

306
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,422
an elementary image of ourselves.

307
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:43,913
It is not always easy.

308
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:49,063
So, this sad occasion today, inescapably
leads us to the Glauco column.

309
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:54,487
He lived in Eleusis 2000 years ago. He was
a priest in the mysteries of Eleusis.

310
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,177
As we read in the inscription.

311
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:59,652
He revealed to adepts the
sacred mysteries for 9 years.

312
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:02,805
In the tenth year he "crossed
towards the immortals".

313
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:09,160
The inscription concludes that for mortals
death is not a bad thing but a good thing.

314
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:11,817
Surely there is great
distance between our era

315
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:14,121
and this meaning of the
mysteries of Eleusis.

316
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:17,539
A few meters from the column
of Glauco Ms. Alexandra

317
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:20,731
at City Hall updates daily
the great book of the world.

318
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:24,304
And if it's a coincidence
that a woman here

319
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:28,429
preserves the memory in this
great existential problem

320
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:30,505
(BOOK OF DEATHS)

321
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:33,176
it's no coincidence at all
that women are desiganted

322
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,000
to preserve the memory of the
dead in the All Souls' Day.

323
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:40,443
In the All Souls' Day
of February you can see

324
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:43,154
pomegranate seeds on the wheat
of the dead (Dead-cake)

325
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:46,776
which Pluto gave to Persephone to force
her to return to the Underworld.

326
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:54,470
In antiquity and as the mysteries
of Eleusis were held here

327
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:56,709
the uninitiated reached up to here.

328
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:59,600
They wre generally slaves
waiting for their master.

329
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:04,674
Here they sat for three days spending
time playing noughts and crosses.

330
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:07,306
Our knowledge today about
the issue of the mysteries

331
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,628
is not in any case greater
than this of the slaves.

332
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:12,723
Perhaps the slaves heard from here

333
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:16,114
the priest's dramatic warning
"Out with the profane".

334
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:19,419
With the passing of the years
the profane increased.

335
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:24,110
And they invaded the sanctuary, as
the water in a boat about to sink.

336
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:30,101
These ruins today are haunted
by a faded ancient myth.

337
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:32,324
Thanks to the signification
of the myth,

338
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:35,887
humanity learned everything related
to the cultivation of Cereal,

339
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:37,412
which assured her survival.

340
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:41,658
But mainly learned everything related
the performance of the mysteries

341
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:44,117
that ensured the cultivation of the soul

342
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:47,341
and granted hope and
blessedness to face death.

343
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:52,436
The shrines were destroyed.

344
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,164
The gods worshiped here setted
(died), except for Persephone

345
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:59,182
who never stopped the
turnings of the cycle.

346
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:03,638
The new religion of Christianity gave
answers to the agonizing questions.

347
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:07,956
Today, 20 November, halfway
through grain planting,

348
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,980
The small church of the Virgin
of midway-sowing celebrates.

349
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,724
Next to the ancient site of ceremonies.

350
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:21,075
♫ Take and eat;
this is My body ♫

351
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,796
♫ which is broken for you
for the remission of sins ♫

352
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,300
♫ Thine own of Thine own, we offer
You, in behalf of all, and for all ♫

353
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:56,892
Again we offer to You this spiritual and
unbloody sacrifice, and we implore and pray,

354
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:04,548
and entreat You, send down Your Holy Spirit
upon us and upon these gifts here present.

355
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:09,286
And make this bread the
precious body of Your Christ.

356
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:15,420
And that which is in this chalice,
the precious blood of your Christ. Amen

357
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:48,459
Neither today the move of
the sarcophagus took place,

358
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:50,985
nor that of the sepulchral
column or the rest

359
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:53,742
of the sculptures from
the Liberis plot.

360
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:56,881
Today I received a card.
It was from Popi Papageli.

361
00:29:57,901 --> 00:30:00,270
She accompanies the
ancient Greek sculptures

362
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:03,716
to the exhibition for the 500 years
of the discovery of America.

363
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
She wrote:

364
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:08,475
"My daughter smiled to me, with
that askew smile of hers."

365
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,566
"Around her uniformed guards,."

366
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:13,080
"Polish operators of lifting machines,."

367
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,171
"American preservers
with gum and ponytail,"

368
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:17,818
"but she smiled at me."

369
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:21,138
" Our craftsmen raised
her with white gloves,"

370
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:23,362
"wrapped her with clean sheets,"

371
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:25,339
"She was placed in the wooden box."

372
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:28,520
"And they closed the space above
with insulating material."

373
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:30,796
"Like a grave said a black guard."

374
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,424
"I followed her in the travel of
the dungeons of National Gallery."

375
00:30:34,448 --> 00:30:36,885
"But she is not anymore a
breath of the Underworld."

376
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:39,376
"She is just the number fifteen box."

377
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:41,839
Many unrelated things
come to my mind.

378
00:30:41,864 --> 00:30:44,172
(NO TO THE TRANSFER OF THE
MUSEUM SCULPTURES TO THE US)

379
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:46,767
I remember that Sunday that
some high school students

380
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:50,658
came to protest so that the
statues won't leave the city.

381
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:06,655
I also remember the image of the girl when
she finally left inside the wooden box.

382
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:26,941
A new face has been added to
the other images in the area.

383
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,303
The face of this handsome man.

384
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:33,741
For advertising purposes an
exotic landscape was inducted

385
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:35,832
and two women looking with awe.

386
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,994
If we needed to add a
word that would be: Melancholy.

387
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,421
I've seen those faces in the past.

388
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:46,575
In Sacred Street, in Skaramagkas,
in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite,

389
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:49,066
In the Reitans' lagoon near Fritoria.

390
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:51,514
In Aspropyrgos, I have
seen them many a times.

391
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:53,919
And if you combine them with this area

392
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:55,963
they could be faces in a tragedy.

393
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:58,120
Or the tombstones of this world.

394
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,986
September 1st 1992, Tuesday.

395
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,771
First day of autumn today.

396
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:08,248
In the morning there was a great
explosion in the Petrola refineries.

397
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:11,539
At first the news spoke
of one burn victim dead.

398
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,965
Few hours later, the
fire was extinguished.

399
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:21,306
I remember an advertising film for
the other refineries of Aspropyrgos.

400
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:25,160
Here a white bird tries to
convince us as a symbol of purity.

401
00:33:25,184 --> 00:33:29,567
However, today in this case, some black
birds, carriers of a bad fortune

402
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:34,724
showed the way for a total of 14 people
losing their lives in this accident.

403
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:40,876
Where to go? Where we used to
eat is now scorched earth.

404
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,940
They cleaned the scrapyard one
day and this thing appeared.

405
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:52,625
Bread?

406
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:53,649
What?

407
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:56,503
There's a bakery here.
Do you want bread?

408
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:25,428
Somewhere here there is a base by
the sea. Can you film it from afar?

409
00:34:34,392 --> 00:34:36,659
Down by there, that's where it is.

410
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:50,036
I started from this sea here and
arrived at the sea in Halkida

411
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,605
and all the way back because
I couldn't go on anymore..

412
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:56,029
You go from one place to another and back.

413
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:04,653
Hey! Is your family in town?
Relatives and such?

414
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:07,951
I've left years ago and I don't know.

415
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,104
But you go occasionally!

416
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,213
I go as a bystander and a passer-by.

417
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:24,148
Sit down for a second. Sit on the
bench so that we can rest a little.

418
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:41,089
Our excavational observations
for these two sarcophagus

419
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:45,046
are that both are of the same
material, marble of Penteli,

420
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:50,639
They are almost equal in size, and
today, with the excavation of the trench

421
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,409
that had been dugged for
the two sarcophagi,

422
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:57,832
we ascertained that the
trench was a common one.

423
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:02,900
One pit had been dugged in order for
the two sarcophagi to be put together.

424
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:06,383
They buried them at the same
time in two same sarcophagi,

425
00:36:06,408 --> 00:36:08,590
in a common pit, at
the same height.

426
00:36:08,614 --> 00:36:11,681
They bought them the
same funerary offerings.

427
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:14,886
When they were opened, we saw they
were left in the same position

428
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,926
looking each other for 24 centuries.

429
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,813
The eastside sarcophagus contained
within a very important finding.

430
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:23,104
A helmet of the cavalry of Thebes.

431
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:27,603
According to a very bold
version, we can presume

432
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:31,960
that these two men of Eleusis
belonged to the cavalry of Thebes.

433
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,667
Maybe they were killed in
the battle of Leuctra.

434
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:39,204
July 19th, 371 B.C.

435
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:46,092
The Thebans defeated the until
then invincible Spartans.

436
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,375
Thanks to the political and
military genius of Epaminondas.

437
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:53,599
And together they won for a brief
time the hegemony of Greece.

438
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:57,133
An old battlefield.

439
00:36:57,193 --> 00:37:00,209
Nature has given it life
once again with her flowers.

440
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:03,900
This is what is left of the
dream of two myriads dead.

441
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:08,902
Towards the sunset, there was a truce,
to collect the dead from both sides.

442
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,183
Many Spartans, not as many Thebans.

443
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:14,066
At this hour they must have taken
the two Theban cavalrymen.

444
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,424
Afterwards, they were
buried in their city.

445
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:20,207
In the cemetery north of the ceremonies
area, now called Dalis plot.

446
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,022
History does not mention the
names of those who make it.

447
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:28,907
Let us be granted the arbitrariness
of naming the two horsemen of Eleusis

448
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:32,520
even though we do not know their
names, as the conditions in their city

449
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:37,411
24 centuries after their death,
forced them into a last exhumacion.

450
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:05,557
Ceres (Demeter) Str.
Sacred Str.

451
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:15,311
February 15th, 1992, Monday.

452
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:20,330
Cold and cloudy, and a rain always about
to start but never actually does.

453
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:24,398
Nothing was recorded today, apart from a
frame of Farmakis Panagiotis in the market.

454
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:28,955
It seems enough as a comment of
what can one expect from this city.

455
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:33,857
The excavation in the Pepa
plot continues rapidly.

456
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,311
Here they also find
coins of the Roman era.

457
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,269
In the Liberis plot a
sepulchral column was found.

458
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:48,426
Placed sideways we can not read
if there is anything written.

459
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:51,718
I passed by the refugee neighborhood.

460
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:55,809
Small houses of a stereotypical
architecture made with adobes.

461
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:59,384
From this place refugees
started again from scratch.

462
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:01,741
But they had a love for
life and prosperity.

463
00:39:02,478 --> 00:39:05,078
Virtues of a superior culture of lonia.

464
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:10,152
On the other hand, shuffling
I must quote Giorgos Krionas

465
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:12,092
who spoke to me yesterday
of his wife who died

466
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,992
the other day, and he
is not very well since.

467
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:16,722
I have to place many
mosaic blocks to create

468
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:19,575
an elementary image of this city.
This I know.

469
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,958
For today, we should keep
this fleeting motion

470
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:23,987
of Panagiotis Farmakis
from the market.

471
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:25,211
A fleeting shadow.

472
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:29,512
Today I passed by Papagianni str.

473
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,169
I saw the Tirlis building.
By now it has been built.

474
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:37,526
The limits of this plot coincided precisely
with those of the archaic cemetery.

475
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:43,754
That woman of the sarcophagus
number nine came to my mind.

476
00:39:44,153 --> 00:39:45,591
She lived in the classical era.

477
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:50,353
They consecrated to her among other
things a personal object. Her mirror.

478
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:53,644
I imagine the image of this
woman through the mirror.

479
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:55,612
I imagine the images of her world.

480
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:58,175
The things we learn
in schools today.

481
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,339
I remember the disappointment
that I felt when

482
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:04,636
we reached the chapter of
the Peloponnesian War.

483
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,744
With great surprise, I saw
today the iridescences of

484
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:13,301
the mirror while coming to
light for the first time.

485
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:18,846
It was as if it was returning the images
that it had saved all those distant years.

486
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,191
These signs, along with
the greatest of this city

487
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:24,341
fly over it in invisible spots.

488
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:36,026
The bridge was brought
into use in late 1994.

489
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:40,835
In January, late in the
afternoon, the trucks from way up

490
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:44,770
cast their shadow over the few
marbles of the helenistic tower

491
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:46,661
that now lies on the ground.

492
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,825
It was once erect, with
white marbles of Penteli

493
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,206
and therefore it was called
Aspropirgos (White Tower).

494
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,830
Otherwise, the name used by
locals is Kalyvia (Huts).

495
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:00,811
If this afternoon all this seems
to you more cheerful than ever

496
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:04,173
It is due to the fact that years ago
a girl passed through here.

497
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,522
She wore the traditional dress of
the area that locals call camisola.

498
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:11,346
Brunette, of medium height,

499
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:15,900
she was so beautiful that this
impeded her from marryimg.

500
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:19,377
Her coevals, even now,
when they mention her name

501
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:24,268
raise slightly the tone of his voice,
followed by an imperceptible sigh.

502
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:29,017
She could not have any
name other than Mary.

503
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:32,508
I got to know her through
descriptions and old photos

504
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,816
taken in the archaeological place
and in the field of Eleusis

505
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,411
when it existed, before the factories
ad the airport were built there.

506
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:44,035
Miss Mary now lives in her
parents' house by the sea.

507
00:41:44,654 --> 00:41:48,503
We found her sitting in her
favorite place by the window.

508
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:51,527
And temporarily disturbed
her daily reverie.

509
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,790
The last south wind endowed us
with these magnificent colours.

510
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:10,246
The blackbird sits here, and every morning
that I leave in these early hours

511
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,606
he climbs here and he flies
around, and also on that stone.

512
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,623
In the evening, at the late
hours, he passes through

513
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:19,914
here and he goes behind
the factories and nests.

514
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:24,455
Yeah, this hare descends every
afternoon at 18.00 or 19.00.

515
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,080
Down from the clock,
passes through the church,

516
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:31,195
goes down these stairs here,
and eats the pasture.

517
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:36,122
And in the morning at 5 or 6am
returns along the same path

518
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:40,368
and he returns to the mountain
to settle down for the day.

519
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:44,274
The snake population has also declined.

520
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:49,211
Two of them had remained. The
female one was burnt with the Fire.

521
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:52,574
I stumbled through the
male one, one night at

522
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:55,668
the clock. It went very
far with great speed.

523
00:42:55,696 --> 00:42:57,963
There are no longer many of these.

524
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:09,191
We found ourselves here
following the Hadrian aqueduct.

525
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:13,615
Nowadays some remains along the
Demeter Str. are still preserved.

526
00:43:14,248 --> 00:43:19,515
A last part was demolished by the council
in 1987, to build the new city hall.

527
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:24,088
Emperor Hadrian visited
Eleusis many times

528
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:26,766
and he was intitiated in
the Eleusinian mysteries.

529
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,701
He contrusted many projects in the city.

530
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:30,992
Thus returning the great
gift of the initiation

531
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:33,046
that was granted upon
him by the sanctuary.

532
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,737
One of these projects was
the aqueduct bringing

533
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:38,485
water from the underflow
of Parnitha to Eleusis.

534
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:42,309
A huge work for its time, a
maximum act of civilization.

535
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:48,516
Here on this farm, the aqueduct
was one of the walls of the barn.

536
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:51,186
The farm also contained a big well

537
00:43:51,811 --> 00:43:57,108
that for over a century watered gardens,
and quenched the thirst of men and cattle.

538
00:43:57,132 --> 00:43:59,132
Today its of no use to anyone.

539
00:43:59,257 --> 00:44:01,566
And since nobody
needs it, let the

540
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,657
archaelogists of the
next millennium find it.

541
00:44:14,803 --> 00:44:18,070
We kept the last image April 5th, 1995.
At 11am.

542
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:31,833
I know that art, and especially literature
has mentioned the great gifts of the well.

543
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:35,179
Along with what happened in
the mouth of the well: Plants

544
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:38,468
were watered, men and cattle
that quenched their thirst,

545
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:41,359
greetings and glances
that were exchanged.

546
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:44,652
But more than anything the
thoughts of the monk come to mind,

547
00:44:44,676 --> 00:44:48,409
When he reached the well when
the waters become cloudy.

548
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:56,615
"I stopped at one of the three wells
and reaching my hand on the wellhead,"

549
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,972
"I leaned over to see if
the water was abundant."

550
00:45:00,238 --> 00:45:03,105
"I saw it half-full and
I said thank God."

551
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:07,394
"So sweet the freshness that the summer
deprives from the bowels of man."

552
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:10,885
"Great his works (are) and great
the ingratitude of man (is)."

553
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:14,303
"And according to the gospel,
how many are the righteous?"

554
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,994
"And contemplating this,
my eyes rested on

555
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:20,018
my hands, which were
place on the wellhead."

556
00:45:23,707 --> 00:45:26,707
Returning we saw the
boats again levitating.

557
00:45:28,578 --> 00:45:32,416
I wish I could thank you little
sparrow for the look you granted us.

558
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,884
Although I saw it correctly
from the camera,

559
00:45:34,908 --> 00:45:36,938
you looked at us a
bit suspiciously.

560
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:41,021
However your presence gives us the
sense of measure and equilibrium.

561
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:44,245
Here on this place where
it has long lost them.

562
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:50,126
October 14th, 1995.

563
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,531
Today the antiquities were placed
below the Karagiannis plot.

564
00:45:55,555 --> 00:46:00,355
Αngel, who we encountered here, is
working occasionaly in construction.

565
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:04,843
No doubt his figure has
potentially existed in

566
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:08,334
containers and marble
sculptures of late antiquity.

567
00:46:08,712 --> 00:46:13,006
It reminds me strongly of this famous
teenager who is in the museum.

568
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,496
Antinoos from distant
Vitynia, favorite of Hadrian

569
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,817
was the last mortal accepted in
the panteon of the ancient world.

570
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:24,708
His supernatural beauty,
recorded in numerous sculptures,

571
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:28,312
shows the condensation of the
meaning of life and death.

572
00:46:28,336 --> 00:46:33,003
In his sad figure of intense realism,
you can see the turn "inwards".

573
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:38,568
The decline of the ancient
world, which ended with a tear.

574
00:47:22,992 --> 00:47:27,058
This noon we find ourselves almost
uninvited in Mrs. Koula's house.

575
00:47:27,082 --> 00:47:29,975
In her small kitchen, with
the exemplary simplicity,

576
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:33,532
you find the archetypical
definition of hospitality.

577
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:36,421
A miniature of the world
the way we dream about it.

578
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:38,394
Where do you frequent at night?

579
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:39,685
I walk around here.

580
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:42,041
I am free, I saunter. I rotate.

581
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,973
Haven't you finished 
(the project about) Eleusis?

582
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:53,981
Where do you live? Where is your house?
Where do you stay at during the night?

583
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:57,672
Above the earth and beneath the clouds.
How can I say it.

584
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:00,717
Is this your address?

585
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:03,280
How did you say it? Above?

586
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:06,733
Above the earth and below the clouds.

587
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:42,890
Mr. Isaac came as a refugee
from Prokopi of Cappadocia.

588
00:48:42,914 --> 00:48:45,271
As one of the population
exchangees in 1924.

589
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:50,162
These few years he lived as a child
in Cappadocia marked his whole life.

590
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:53,216
Events and facts that
he narrated were often

591
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,013
wrapped in the fog of
the myth of the East.

592
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:59,826
He loved Venizelos and Plastiras
as most of the refugees did.

593
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,850
Saint John the Russian was also
from Prokopi of Cappadocia.

594
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:08,633
And as Eneas brought his old father from
Troy same with the residents of Prokopi.

595
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:12,544
The first of the few things they
brought back in their new homeland

596
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:14,321
were from the bones
of the saint.

597
00:49:14,346 --> 00:49:16,588
That's what they regarded
as their fortune.

598
00:49:16,612 --> 00:49:18,412
The only fortune is memory.

599
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:31,437
August 1993.

600
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:37,363
This year's summer has no shortage
of wars, disasters and tensions.

601
00:49:38,173 --> 00:49:41,573
The news these days, as
always, compete to impress

602
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,169
a gaze that is already accustomed
to any kind of atrocities.

603
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:48,060
War in Bosnia, tension
grown by Americans.

604
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:50,859
Turkish provocativeness.

605
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:52,622
Ι already know all this.

606
00:49:52,646 --> 00:49:55,440
But I prefer to talk about
this fishing couple

607
00:49:55,464 --> 00:49:59,064
who have taken their boat
out for repairs these days.

608
00:49:59,117 --> 00:50:01,912
I feel these simple, modest
and archetypical movements

609
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:06,203
balance the heavy and charged
"air" that hovers over our heads.

610
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:28,568
Once more I feel the things that
Chrisa preserves resemble her.

611
00:51:28,592 --> 00:51:31,434
The way she holds the
idol is an assuredness

612
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:34,525
that love has not been
missed from the world.

613
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:43,022
Argyro was this small
girl we had seen playing

614
00:51:43,046 --> 00:51:45,846
on the two sarcophagi
on the Dalios plot.

615
00:51:46,915 --> 00:51:49,961
Today she is in the fifth
grade and she reminds me

616
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:53,545
of another small girl that lived
in Eleusis 2000 years ago.

617
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,302
She was called Nicostrata.

618
00:51:56,892 --> 00:51:59,954
Above the image of St.
Zachary which is kissed by

619
00:51:59,978 --> 00:52:03,911
believers, lies Nicostrata's
inscription, or the opposite.

620
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:10,335
The small church is built with ancient
marbles, scattered around here.

621
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:13,264
It's like that so that we remember
the loans of Christianity.

622
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:15,032
From the Dodecatheon of ancient Greece

623
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:19,989
and mainly from the worship of Demeter
and her daughter, here in Eleusis.

624
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,337
The vesper done in early September.

625
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:28,019
When days start to shorten, and
Persephone prepares for the new journey,

626
00:52:28,043 --> 00:52:30,110
they prefer to hold it outside.

627
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,820
Nicostrata, St. Zachary.

628
00:52:37,729 --> 00:52:42,062
Those two lived about the same
era, serving different religions.

629
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:45,603
St. Zachary, minister of
the Church of Jerusalem.

630
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:48,918
And Nicostrata, as the
inscription tells us,

631
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:51,615
since a young girl, she was
initiated from her home,

632
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:55,603
in the worship of Demeter and
her daughter, here in Eleusis.

633
00:52:55,627 --> 00:52:58,693
Nicostrata: Her name doesn't come
from "nicos" which means hatred

634
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,330
which according to
Empedocles comes out often

635
00:53:01,354 --> 00:53:04,554
and captures the world
in the opposite of love.

636
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:07,329
As for her image, which
we don't possess,

637
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:10,699
we rather must seek it in the
faces of the women today.

638
00:53:10,723 --> 00:53:14,337
There must be some kind of relevance,
otherwise we cannot explain

639
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:18,361
the familiarity with which they
sit on the ancient marbles.

640
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,850
September 23th, day that the Elefsinian
mysteries began was a day like today.

641
00:53:28,658 --> 00:53:32,410
I decided to follow the procession of
the since invisible travelling players

642
00:53:32,434 --> 00:53:36,701
as it started early from Athens
to Eleusis, through Sacred Str.

643
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,790
In the area of Keramikos, there is the
excavation for construction of the subway.

644
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:44,563
Occasionally some gazes escape, fleeting
images that linger on the mind for a while,

645
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:48,854
while you unsuspectingly pass by
Sacred Str. on foot or by car.

646
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:52,018
We have to somehow connect
these fleeting images

647
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:55,139
with what was hapenning thousands
of years ago on a day like today.

648
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:59,905
I'm afraid that the images of the procession
of the initiates to the Elefsinian mysteries,

649
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,511
as they have passed down
to us faded, fragmented,

650
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:06,916
correspond roughly to the same images you
can now see in the same area of Keramikos.

651
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,967
On the same street, the same day.

652
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:10,658
They both are incomplete.

653
00:54:14,994 --> 00:54:16,905
Sacred Str. towards Eleusis Street.

654
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:19,396
A look at some of the favorite sites.

655
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:35,378
On the hill of Egaleo, the monument
of Pythioniki harlot from Corinth.

656
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,739
It has not been found. It
must have been somewhere

657
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:39,730
here near the Public
Psychiatric hospital.

658
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:42,760
Every time I pass by here I am
reminded of a verse from Viziinos.

659
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:46,785
He is also buried here, without been
known where exactly his grave is.

660
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:50,609
"And since I mourn
my blonde, blue and celestial light."

661
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:53,965
"The rhythm of the world
changed inside of me."

662
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,873
The Sanctuary of Aphrodite
is mentioned by

663
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:04,349
Pausanias, the traveler
of second century B.C.

664
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,757
We found that these
"cabinets" in the rock

665
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:15,619
until today, some unknown passengers,
use them to dedicate small offerings

666
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:22,876
hoping for different things
than what ancients hoped for.

667
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,545
But the sanctity of the
place, and the consciousness

668
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:30,847
of the holiness of
the place remains.

669
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:35,138
And so, these "cabinets" in the
rock, are "cabinets" of memory.

670
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:44,883
Towards the afternoon, many hours after
our visit of the sanctuary of Aphrodite,

671
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:47,875
we felt for a moment,
with surprise, that the

672
00:55:47,899 --> 00:55:50,543
sense of guilt and sin
has abandoned us.

673
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:54,376
As if our souls were found in a
world before the original sin.

674
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,067
Here desires can become reality.
even the erotic ones.

675
00:55:58,927 --> 00:56:04,127
That's how it worked for centuries. For
some, that's how it works even today.

676
00:56:04,202 --> 00:56:09,402
This small fenced site in a place which
has suffered. It is a kind of a zone.

677
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:14,001
At night they jump over the wired
fence and leave modern offerings

678
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:18,399
in the "cabinets" wth the conviction
that wishes will come true.

679
00:56:37,947 --> 00:56:40,406
Today I received a letter
from Popi (Persephone).

680
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,430
It was about a new excavation.

681
00:56:42,604 --> 00:56:45,004
November 8th, 1996. Archangels' day.

682
00:56:46,754 --> 00:56:50,487
<i>Philip, the central pluvial
pipe of the modern city met</i>

683
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:55,147
<i>the Sacred Str. Of ancient Eleusis,
and the archaelogists rushed.</i>

684
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:01,024
<i>The mechanical excavator of company
responsible for the work, ripped the</i>

685
00:57:01,048 --> 00:57:05,052
<i>asphalt layer and amidst clouds of
dust brought the antiquities to light.</i>

686
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:08,743
<i>They are being cleaned by
Stratos, George, Hasan from.</i>

687
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,303
<i>Komotini, and Ivan, the
Russian who we call John.</i>

688
00:57:12,482 --> 00:57:15,415
<i>The storeowners complain
because we stopped</i>

689
00:57:15,552 --> 00:57:18,329
<i>the traffic, along with
customer traffic, too.</i>

690
00:57:18,353 --> 00:57:20,420
<i>Elders stand still for a while.</i>

691
00:57:21,016 --> 00:57:25,282
<i>Some schoolkids stop for a moment. They
found antiquitues, says the teacher,</i>

692
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:29,734
<i>while gently pushing the kids to carry
on, so as not to go out of schedule.</i>

693
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:33,316
<i>This Fall, it's mornings like this,
that when I arrive</i>

694
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,148
<i>before going down to the pit, I
stop for a moment and loiter.</i>

695
00:57:37,172 --> 00:57:40,172
<i>I see the stone floor,
smoothed by thousands</i>

696
00:57:40,633 --> 00:57:42,900
<i>of footsteps,
etched by wheelcars</i>

697
00:57:43,171 --> 00:57:48,171
<i>which came to light after so many
centuries, only to disappear again soon,</i>

698
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:53,791
<i>and this time forever. Our age is
relentless. After all, life must go on.</i>

699
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:58,528
<i>I'm standing on the edge of the ditch.
The air smells of acacia.</i>

700
00:57:58,777 --> 00:58:03,488
<i>And for a moment, just for a moment,
it's like invisible travelling players</i>

701
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:08,201
<i>passing by with exquisite music, with
voices heading to the sanctuary.</i>

702
00:58:08,225 --> 00:58:12,661
<i>I sense my extreme fortunate to have
standed where the initiated passed by.</i>

703
00:58:12,685 --> 00:58:15,685
<i>To have cast, in the
blink of an eye, a gaze</i>

704
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:18,788
<i>in the past. A rare
and bitter privilege.</i>

705
00:58:18,812 --> 00:58:21,846
<i>I wonder, what does
rescue archaelogy rescue?</i>

706
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,070
<i>This gaze of ours?</i>

707
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:26,493
<i>One bronze coin that slipped
from someone careless,</i>

708
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:28,988
<i>and we gathered it after
so many centuries?</i>

709
00:58:29,012 --> 00:58:31,201
<i>The pieces of a crock
from some traveler</i>

710
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:33,726
<i>that broke before he
quenched his thirst?</i>

711
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,350
<i>The drawing of it?
The general photos?</i>

712
00:58:37,325 --> 00:58:40,858
<i>The brief publication in the
archaelogical bulletin?</i>

713
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:45,004
<i>The travelling players passed.
The air still smells of acacia.</i>

714
00:58:45,028 --> 00:58:46,495
<i>The acacia is present.</i>

715
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:51,743
Spring has come late this year, fifteen
days much later than other years,

716
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:57,029
So have the swallows done.
Only five days ago, they came.

717
00:58:58,249 --> 00:59:01,784
There are many flowers, the
whole place is very cheerful

718
00:59:01,808 --> 00:59:05,208
but I don't know all the
flowers to describe them.

719
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:09,904
Cause I know them in my language,
Arvanitika from small child.

720
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,463
I don't know where else
could this be written

721
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:23,020
but let me note it
here in this film.

722
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:27,459
Today, Holy Tuesday 1995, April
the18th was the last day that

723
00:59:27,885 --> 00:59:32,085
the guard, John Sotiriou worked
in the antiquities of Eleusis.

724
00:59:32,415 --> 00:59:36,082
I should also note his great
love for the environment,

725
00:59:36,627 --> 00:59:39,360
herbs, flowers, birds
and other animals.

726
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:44,192
Love that stands very far from the
modern ecological trends, but maintains

727
00:59:44,825 --> 00:59:49,358
components of balance, thrift and
wisdom like all things authentic.

728
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,406
When the fig leaf is as thick as
a goose foot, spring arrives.

729
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:59,087
You see it everywhere, while nature
preens herself to welcome Persephone.

730
00:59:59,111 --> 01:00:01,540
Tonight I encounter
Panagiotis Farmakis,

731
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,986
outside the church of Saints
Apostles in the neighborhood.

732
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,684
He had a cosmic innocence
but mainly the

733
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,751
discomfort of the ancient
religion's High Priest.

734
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:13,559
That's why his figure doens't
rub shoulders with the

735
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:17,050
faces of the believers who
go to church these days.

736
01:00:28,427 --> 01:00:31,094
<i>Seeing that the sun
had hidden its rays</i>

737
01:00:31,175 --> 01:00:35,201
<i>and the veil of the Temple had been
rent at the death of the Saviour,</i>

738
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:39,093
<i>Joseph did approach Pilate and did
plead with him crying and saying,</i>

739
01:00:39,117 --> 01:00:43,984
<i>Give me this stranger, who from his
youth hath wandered like a stranger.</i>

740
01:00:44,887 --> 01:00:48,701
<i>Give me this stranger, whom his kinsmen
killed in hatred like a stranger.</i>

741
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:53,023
<i>Give me this stranger at whom I wonder,
beholding him as a guest of death.</i>

742
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:57,914
<i>Give me this stranger who knoweth how
to take in the poor and strangers.</i>

743
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:01,864
<i>Give me this stranger whom the Jews
in envy estranged from the world.</i>

744
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:04,886
<i>Give me this stranger that
I may bury him in a tomb,</i>

745
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,305
<i>who being a stranger hath no
place whereon to lay his head.</i>

746
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:11,876
<i>Give me this stranger, to whom
his Mother, beholding him dead,</i>

747
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,957
<i>shouted crying, “O my Son and my God,
even though my vitals be wounded,</i>

748
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:18,494
<i>and my heart burns, as
I behold thee dead,</i>

749
01:01:18,518 --> 01:01:21,918
<i>yet trusting in thy
Resurrection, I magnify thee.”</i>

750
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,910
<i>The incarnation of Son
and Word of God would</i>

751
01:01:26,345 --> 01:01:29,012
<i>be meaningless if not
for resurrection.</i>

752
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:33,976
<i>Now everything is filled with light,
on heaven, on earth and in hell.</i>

753
01:01:34,669 --> 01:01:39,411
Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and
be ye lifted up, O eternal gates:

754
01:01:39,435 --> 01:01:43,768
- And the King of Glory shall enter in.
- Who is this King of Glory?

755
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,441
Its Him the King of Glory.

756
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,013
Panagiotis Farmakis has died.

757
01:01:57,371 --> 01:02:00,891
Women here in Kleidi, placed a
marital crown upon his head,

758
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:06,735
which until yesterday he covered
carefully not to reveal his halo.

759
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:13,014
Today this wanderer (anc. greek: planet)
goes upwards to Arctos (Ursa).

760
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:17,030
Maybe he is pulled there by the
gravity of another planet.

761
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:21,328
The Boeotian field, the field
of Thriasio, and mainly Eleusis

762
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:24,296
know the unique virtues
of this wanderer.

763
01:03:11,214 --> 01:03:12,214
Aeschylus Str.

764
01:03:22,092 --> 01:03:25,020
He crossed the Thriasio
field with aν incredible

765
01:03:25,044 --> 01:03:27,577
mobility every season
for many years.

766
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:32,856
His only fortune, his coat
which always covered his head

767
01:03:33,626 --> 01:03:36,893
and sometimes a plastic
bag he carried with him.

768
01:03:38,297 --> 01:03:41,230
Of his contemporaries, I
do not know anyone

769
01:03:42,242 --> 01:03:45,575
who has any assets at all
and not worry about it.

770
01:03:45,746 --> 01:03:49,665
On the contrary, he sensed that all
modern and mostly all ancient things

771
01:03:49,689 --> 01:03:52,618
from the Thriasio to the
Boeotian field to belong to him.

772
01:03:52,642 --> 01:03:56,842
With a selfless and cosmic
relationship that God has with men.

773
01:03:57,128 --> 01:04:02,026
He was born in 1930, when Greece suffered
the consequences of the Great Idea,

774
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:03,967
when TITAN had only one chimney

775
01:04:03,992 --> 01:04:07,552
and Kourouniotis was digging
in the archaelogical space.

776
01:04:07,575 --> 01:04:10,442
So he was born in Diramari, present-day Dafni,

777
01:04:11,827 --> 01:04:14,663
one small village on the
slopes of the Boeotian field

778
01:04:14,687 --> 01:04:18,554
of which the only thing worth
mentioning is its cemetery.

779
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:23,339
It was one of those figures that
appeared coming from the Thriasio field

780
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:27,568
in a cloud of dust, the morning of
the crucial naval battle of Salamis

781
01:04:27,592 --> 01:04:31,059
while the outcome was still
hanging in the balance.

782
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:36,068
This same figure is found in the
texts Solomos on Mesologgi.

783
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:42,315
I feel fortunate that my humble art
saved some images of this same figure.

784
01:04:42,339 --> 01:04:47,091
That appeared once again in this tried
place, at the end of the second millennium.

785
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:52,182
Where the current danger we would call
it selfishness, individual interest.

786
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,524
Aeschylus is not in his place.

787
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:08,118
The mayor changed, the
statue's place changed too.

788
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:12,209
Here in Tristrato, he is lost
among a thousand other things.

789
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:18,856
Sometimes you see him escaping too, as a
passenger for Athens, by Sacred Str way.

790
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:29,144
I like to observe the harmony of the lines
while the stones succeed one another.

791
01:05:29,168 --> 01:05:33,192
It was constructed in the archaic period
as a protective wall against the river.

792
01:05:33,216 --> 01:05:36,466
In the afternoon, the sun
makes it relief, as they

793
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:39,545
purposefully left the
external side unfinished.

794
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:43,836
Observing it with atention you
find on it the basic perceptions

795
01:05:44,435 --> 01:05:47,502
that characterize a work
of contemporary art.

796
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,773
I spent many evenings watching the
sun chariot, while setting,

797
01:05:53,797 --> 01:05:57,299
And I always think about how
the sunset looks like in Eleusis.

798
01:05:57,323 --> 01:06:00,323
I know that when the
sun's orbit lowers, one

799
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:03,655
of the antefixes of the
house in Pericles Str,

800
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:09,194
the one looking towards Salamina, it grants
us with a magnificent archaic smile.

801
01:06:09,945 --> 01:06:13,421
This should be the time that Ms.
Helen is preparing to light

802
01:06:13,445 --> 01:06:17,178
candles in the roadside shrine
for memory and eternity.

803
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:21,539
It is also time when the adolescents
begin to gather on the beach.

804
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:27,030
While on the seaside the night comes,
bringing with her this discreet melancholy.

805
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:46,911
We don't know if the current
customers of this chain of

806
01:06:46,935 --> 01:06:49,757
restaurants taste even
figuratively such experiences

807
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:54,714
as the one tasted by this unsuspecting
young man who ordered a hamburger.

808
01:06:55,275 --> 01:06:58,918
Modern nymphs who are mobilized
and they dont live in sacred groves.

809
01:06:58,942 --> 01:07:01,342
Thir place is the television screen.

810
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:04,898
Thus we could not find a
better way to narrate

811
01:07:05,787 --> 01:07:07,633
the brief history of
this plot (as in site),

812
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:11,790
That the unsurpassed philosophy
of our times: The video-clip.

813
01:07:51,553 --> 01:07:56,553
2000 years ago some ceramists earned
their bread working in this workshop.

814
01:07:57,292 --> 01:08:00,987
The furnace where the pots were
baked is the one in the east corner.

815
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:05,589
We do not know their names, but some
works made by their hands were saved.

816
01:08:05,613 --> 01:08:09,946
These marks is avery old greeting
imprinted on these clay plates

817
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,513
who may have been baked
here, in this furnace.

818
01:08:15,465 --> 01:08:19,817
Spiridoula of Plataea, who lives in the
working class neighborhood of Eleusis,

819
01:08:19,841 --> 01:08:22,744
and works in this restaurant
chain was kind enough

820
01:08:22,768 --> 01:08:25,615
today to guide us in the
basement of the building,

821
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:29,269
where next to the boss's office
the furnace has been retained.

822
01:08:29,293 --> 01:08:32,360
Thus Spiridula, Mary,
Despina, Kostas, Nikos,

823
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:35,749
Dionisis and the rest
from other shifts

824
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:39,916
worked in the same place as the
ceramists of the Roman period,

825
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:44,007
close somehow this small circle
of the history of this plot.

826
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,687
(MARLON BRANDO AMONG US!)

827
01:08:48,723 --> 01:08:51,216
These days the journals
are full of reports

828
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,848
about the arrival of
Marlon Brando to Greece.

829
01:08:53,872 --> 01:08:56,651
He has been invited by the
owners of the Petrola

830
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:59,683
refinery and is about to
talk about the environment.

831
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:02,726
For reasons of justice, I
only want to commemorate

832
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,734
with satisfaction that Mrs.
Heleni continues with

833
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:08,836
her modest way to light
every night on the roadsite

834
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:12,260
shrine this small flame
that makes things balance.

835
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:20,031
The city changes faces very
fast, at least externally.

836
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,855
Many times nothing comes out,
neither in mood or images.

837
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:27,508
As for the internal face I
am too ignorant to answer.

838
01:09:27,532 --> 01:09:30,180
That's what I also search,
not always with success.

839
01:09:30,204 --> 01:09:33,049
And if tehy ask me where and how
many times I encountered it

840
01:09:33,073 --> 01:09:36,790
I wiil recall offhand, last year one
afternoon, Giorgos Krionas.

841
01:09:36,814 --> 01:09:38,147
All I can say now...

842
01:09:39,518 --> 01:09:42,985
The mother-in-law of my
grandson came from the USA.

843
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:48,515
She says to me:"Grandpa,
that's how life goes, now

844
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:52,452
(she) is waiting for you...
(she) is waiting".

845
01:09:55,019 --> 01:09:59,486
If it is true that souls meet again...
Religion says that they do.

846
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,723
Do you understand? What is to be done?

847
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,891
Whatever we say now, we are
closer there (to the Underworld).

848
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:16,286
Here I sensed for the
first time, the anguish

849
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,318
of a person to spread
to whole regions.

850
01:10:18,342 --> 01:10:22,275
In those he lived, in those he
worked, in those he dreamt.

851
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,950
His word acquires in teh
end a cosmic value.

852
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:33,393
In the field of separation
lilies will bloom again.

853
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,070
I often buy honey from Ms. Perdica.

854
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,958
You find her her here, too in
the farmers' market every Monday.

855
01:10:45,982 --> 01:10:48,225
She also hails from a refugee family.

856
01:10:48,249 --> 01:10:50,782
However, she was born here in Eleusis.

857
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:55,026
She knows the story of Ms.
Demeter and she passed it on to me.

858
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:02,927
The Turks came and our parents
apparently held our hands,

859
01:11:04,054 --> 01:11:08,921
but there was such a panic that I slipped.
I knew how to go to the beach

860
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,212
where the boats were.

861
01:11:13,643 --> 01:11:17,104
I get up and go alone, among so many
people " she says "I went alone" she says.

862
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:20,328
The Turks kidnapped,
killed, and wrecked havoc.

863
01:11:22,942 --> 01:11:27,542
I reached the beach, I was crying
so an old man took me by the hand.

864
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:33,803
He took me by the hand," he says,
"come here small one what do you wany?"

865
01:11:35,032 --> 01:11:37,399
"My mother," she says.
"I'll take you there", he said.

866
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:41,023
And he took her to the ship
where her mother was. And

867
01:11:41,124 --> 01:11:44,724
she spent the whole night
with the old man till dawn.

868
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:48,400
He took her the other day and
brought her to her mother.

869
01:11:48,424 --> 01:11:51,891
And when she asked "Who
brought you?" She was about

870
01:11:52,543 --> 01:11:55,810
to say "The old man" but
there was no one there.

871
01:11:57,869 --> 01:12:00,259
She was left puzzled.
It was Saint Nicholas.

872
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:04,416
Saint Nicholas, here in Eleusis,
he also hides an old legend.

873
01:12:05,493 --> 01:12:08,360
This small church was
in that period about

874
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:12,351
100-150 m. Further away
from where it is now.

875
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:18,341
They wanted to expand the factory, so they
decided tomove it to this site.

876
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:23,749
When they gave the demolition
order, the mαchines

877
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:26,781
began to work like crazy,
topsyturvy, abnormally.

878
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,738
Nobody wanted to demolish it.

879
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,942
And then they found the
so-called Vranas, who had

880
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:40,179
the courage to demolish
the curch, and he did it.

881
01:12:40,203 --> 01:12:43,270
When he took the bus
home, a passing car took

882
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:47,233
his arm that hanged
from the window bus..

883
01:12:56,197 --> 01:13:00,008
They started performing litanies
and with the help of the

884
01:13:00,032 --> 01:13:04,165
clergy they demolished it and
brought it to its current site.

885
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:11,830
In evening song, on December 5th, you will
always find the old workers of TITAN.

886
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:13,845
It's like a vow.

887
01:13:15,827 --> 01:13:20,427
In '47, we came, as I remember and
we signed a contract on 21 March.

888
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,534
And now only 10 people are left.

889
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,268
Yeah it, of course, they all died.

890
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:36,292
Cement. They built another part
of the factory, The KAOLIN.

891
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,140
Yeah, yeah. All who went to
work there ended up dead.

892
01:13:43,858 --> 01:13:46,396
- Their stomach.
- All Who went to work came back dead.

893
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,687
In the lungs. And there
was no way to get it out

894
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:53,572
(tumor). ♫ blessed,
immortal O Jesus Christ ♫

895
01:14:08,798 --> 01:14:11,171
The lady from the neighbourhood
that the day before yesterday

896
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:13,647
asked for a small bone from the
sarcophagus no.10 as an talisman

897
01:14:13,671 --> 01:14:15,791
came back today, and this
time she didn't ask for

898
01:14:15,815 --> 01:14:18,151
anything because yesterday
they told her lightheartedly.

899
01:14:18,175 --> 01:14:20,175
Wha for? These were idolaters.

900
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:27,927
But she is watching thoughtfully,
trying to understand

901
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:32,044
how Hades grew so big, and maybe
she was saying in her own words.

902
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,468
As Pindar said in a unique way said:

903
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:40,100
Creatures of a day! What is a man? What
is he not? Man is the dream of a shadow.

904
01:14:43,867 --> 01:14:47,291
The copper boiler, a very
valuable object in its day

905
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:49,507
was also a prize in chariot races.

906
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:53,264
A satisfaction for today's
discovery, certainly smaller

907
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:56,838
than that of the chariot
winner who would claim it.

908
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:02,217
From the hill I saw the new
part of the port progressing.

909
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:05,602
I also noticed the cyclamens
in the cracks of the rocks,

910
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:09,626
a sign that Persephone is on her
journey to the underworld.

911
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:18,943
I encountered Antonis, the fisherman
from Samos in the market pass.

912
01:15:18,967 --> 01:15:20,839
That's where he sells his fish.

913
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:22,886
For a monent, he told me the unexpected.

914
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:26,084
Do you remember my wife?
She is not alive anymore.

915
01:15:26,108 --> 01:15:29,441
And alas, I sensed that I
had seen all this dfrom

916
01:15:29,605 --> 01:15:32,472
the few images that we
have of this woman.

917
01:15:33,533 --> 01:15:37,333
A person brings the oars with
which paddle his own life.

918
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:39,514
She waits at the corner,

919
01:15:42,408 --> 01:15:44,008
she is lost in the city.

920
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:58,750
What exaxtly was I looking
for today first day of 1999?

921
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,871
Maybe remorse, because in
the year that passed I

922
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:04,728
didnt occupy myself
sufficiently with Eleusis.

923
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:08,342
On entering the city, I first
glance the statue of Aeschylus.

924
01:16:08,366 --> 01:16:10,499
Lost in a thousand other things,

925
01:16:10,956 --> 01:16:13,693
Although I prefer the other
corner overlooking the.

926
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:17,317
Redumi building where now
the Pisteos Bank is housed.

927
01:16:18,844 --> 01:16:22,826
In the port a ship is sailing among
others anchored and mute.

928
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:26,183
No movement. Niether by
workers, nor by machines.

929
01:16:27,826 --> 01:16:29,693
Only these images for today,

930
01:16:29,914 --> 01:16:34,781
Insufficient sample of a daily agony
that seeks solutions in this place.

931
01:16:37,397 --> 01:16:41,066
Now I contemplate I'm partly on the
territory of Panagiotis Farmakis.

932
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:43,490
Maybe his soul still roams among us,

933
01:16:43,802 --> 01:16:46,469
strolling the spaces like us, aimlessly.

934
01:16:47,678 --> 01:16:51,186
Panagiotis and Charikleia
Kodoliou have died long ago.

935
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:54,433
I look again at the first images
that we have of this couple.

936
01:16:54,457 --> 01:16:58,724
The faces reflect the reconciliation,
the kindness, and decency

937
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,761
you find imprinted on the
sepulchral columns.

938
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:04,829
I also remember when we spoke with
them for the exodus (from Smyrna).

939
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:08,586
70 years have passed. How long are we here?
Since 1922?

940
01:17:08,627 --> 01:17:11,294
Well, I don't know what anyone else does

941
01:17:12,413 --> 01:17:15,880
but my big complaint is that
we can not unite, son.

942
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:25,867
Despite all these tortures,
all this suffering was left in the dustbin.

943
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:30,161
Giorgos Krionas has also died.

944
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:34,389
I remember that afternoon
of July 28th, 1994, when

945
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:37,895
wetook us to his cousin's home, at Mrs.
Tolina's.

946
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:40,734
She gladly spoke of the
adventures of her life.

947
01:17:40,758 --> 01:17:44,558
About the familiarization of
man with sadness and death.

948
01:17:44,722 --> 01:17:49,855
On the right (this) was ours, my father's.
He had built it, new, this house.

949
01:17:51,016 --> 01:17:54,883
He had inside barrels, we had
an oven and we baked bread.

950
01:17:56,187 --> 01:18:00,654
There was a gardenn inside with
many trees, almond trees, flowers.

951
01:18:01,288 --> 01:18:02,310
It was all happiness.

952
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:05,534
Poverty can be endured.
If you do not have meat

953
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,327
you'll eat olives, you'll
eat bread with olives,

954
01:18:10,763 --> 01:18:11,763
The fear...

955
01:18:13,094 --> 01:18:17,494
"Fear" was the last word she
told us, while it began to get dark.

956
01:18:20,151 --> 01:18:24,379
Nikos Kiriazelos works as an oil
painter in the city of Eleusis.

957
01:18:24,403 --> 01:18:28,403
What he mainly incarnates is
the type of cynic philosopher.

958
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,657
He had a unique sense of humor.

959
01:18:30,731 --> 01:18:34,131
I have often heard him to
come down ruthlessly and

960
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:37,694
brightly on all kinds of
powers and petty interests.

961
01:18:39,331 --> 01:18:44,398
My name is Nikos Kiriazelos, I am an
ex-oil painter of the City of Eleusis,

962
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:46,656
And I now guard the cemeteries.

963
01:18:47,778 --> 01:18:51,911
This is the Venetian tower on
the hill west of the sanctuary.

964
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:54,565
The gill was blasted
into pieces in 1954 and

965
01:18:54,589 --> 01:18:57,322
turned into cement by
the TITAN factory.

966
01:18:57,849 --> 01:19:00,734
The tower was destroyed to be
rebuilt again someday elsewhere.

967
01:19:00,758 --> 01:19:05,233
The marbles are housed for40 years
now inside the archaeological site.

968
01:19:05,257 --> 01:19:08,057
The human-like sarcophagus
form is in the

969
01:19:08,107 --> 01:19:11,408
archaeological site, like
that of Lica and Pliny.

970
01:19:11,432 --> 01:19:15,840
The helmet of the Daliou plot, is the
second of its kind found worldwide.

971
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:18,197
The other was found in Mesopotamia.

972
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:22,820
It went there along with the
armies of Alexander the Great.

973
01:19:23,635 --> 01:19:26,902
Tania, or more correctly
Sultana, is that little

974
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:30,041
girl we saw that day in
1992, in the museum.

975
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:32,770
Today, eight years
after, works in her

976
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:36,434
mother's company and
will marry in November.

977
01:19:38,035 --> 01:19:43,290
We saw again the Kourou twins in the same
house, in the same house ten years later.

978
01:19:43,314 --> 01:19:48,914
Dora studied journalism and Despoina is a
graphic artist now, as she always wanted.

979
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:54,110
Sotiris finished his studies and continues
as a postgraduate student in England.

980
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:56,674
I first saw Mary in the
archaelogical site in the

981
01:19:56,698 --> 01:19:59,291
role of Eurydice in the
play of Sofocles, Antigone.

982
01:19:59,315 --> 01:20:02,648
A play performed by the
theater group of Eleusis.

983
01:20:02,736 --> 01:20:07,833
She had something of the greatness that the
chthonic deities of this place possessed.

984
01:20:07,857 --> 01:20:09,983
In other respects, Mary
is a person like the

985
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:11,942
rest of us, with the
same modest concerns

986
01:20:11,966 --> 01:20:16,499
and who the narrow limitations of
this city prevent her developing.

987
01:20:17,147 --> 01:20:21,547
We saw her 10 years later in the
same city with her two children.

988
01:20:22,205 --> 01:20:24,444
Panagiotis Vasiliou
works here at the port.

989
01:20:24,468 --> 01:20:29,935
As an amateur player he has played many
roles. Aegisthus in Aeschylus' Agamemnon,

990
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:35,206
Koryphaio in Antigone of Sofocles,
Agamemnon in "Iphigenie in Aulis".

991
01:20:35,337 --> 01:20:40,100
I remember him telling me that he learned
his roles in the holds of the ships.

992
01:20:40,124 --> 01:20:43,686
The water tube pased under the
Sacred Street. The work is finished.

993
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:47,510
The images of the ancient
Sacred Street no longer exist.

994
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:52,230
Neither the images of the excavations
we've seen all these years.

995
01:20:52,254 --> 01:20:54,769
The building in the Vasiliou
plot has been built.

996
01:20:54,793 --> 01:20:56,660
The wall is in the basement.

997
01:20:57,518 --> 01:21:01,851
We met Ms. Andro here in the
neighborhood in the summer of 1994.

998
01:21:02,259 --> 01:21:04,806
It was the typical image
of a woman from Smyrna.

999
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,963
Lordly height, beauty, kindness.

1000
01:21:09,068 --> 01:21:11,195
She told me: "I do not remember
anything of what happened yesterday."

1001
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:14,819
"I remember everything
we experienced in Asia Minor."

1002
01:21:15,492 --> 01:21:16,559
Did you like it?

1003
01:21:21,522 --> 01:21:26,255
This is the tree where Panagiotis
tied his horse when delivering milk.

1004
01:21:26,343 --> 01:21:31,143
Papa-Kostas, was a priest in the Church
of the Holy Apostles in Eleusis

1005
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,713
for more than 50 years.

1006
01:21:33,591 --> 01:21:37,058
Often he paraphrased a verse
of the hymns of David:

1007
01:21:37,472 --> 01:21:41,164
"I shall be unworthy if I forget
about you my dear Smyrna."

1008
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:44,923
The sepulchral column of the Liberis
plot, after the cleaning, has

1009
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:49,080
proved to have belonged to another
priest, famous in history.

1010
01:21:50,303 --> 01:21:51,370
(Kalias, priest)

1011
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,362
In the new city hall Ms.
Alejandra continues

1012
01:21:57,386 --> 01:21:59,919
updating the great
book of the world.

1013
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:05,230
Sorry Martha, sorry Kostas, sorry
Politimi, sorry Orsalia, sorry Αngel,

1014

sorry Michael, sorry
Demetrius, Giorgos, sorry Mrs.

1015
01:22:08,889 --> 01:22:12,422
Koula, sorry girls in the
church of Saints Apostles,

1016
01:22:12,477 --> 01:22:16,277
And the church of St. George
that you adorn the epitaph,

1017
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:18,784
sorry Peter, Helen,
Mary, Antigone,

1018
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:22,478
sorry Niniun, sorry Ermias,
sorry Aminoklia, Antiphon,

01:22:22,811 --> 01:22:26,478
sorry Nicostrata, Kleokratia,

1020
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:33,143
Sorry Popi, sorry Stratos, Vaggelis, sorry
Chrysa, sorry Stela, sorry Panagioti.

1021
01:22:34,443 --> 01:22:37,631
I couldn't occupy as much
time as needed with you.

1022
01:22:37,655 --> 01:22:40,364
Sorry Eleusis, the last
time I passed by the.

1023
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,521
National Highway, I didn't
even glance at you.
