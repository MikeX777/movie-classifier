1
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,011
No. Alaric, no!
Forgive me

2
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,643
Unfaithful bitch!
You must die

3
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,687
But simple death
is too good for you

4
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,097
Her lungs are fine

5
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,136
The problem is something else

6
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,438
The last tests were not good

7
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,987
Paul...
Your wife is not well

8
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,081
Her heart has become weakened

9
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,721
And getting worse every day

10
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,927
I'm afraid it's serious

11
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,427
What can I do?

12
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,804
Get her out of the city

13
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,266
She needs rest and fresh air

14
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,276
And to relax

15
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,438
I'll give her a strict routine
that she must follow

16
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,272
Will it cure her?

17
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,384
I'm afraid not.
It's very serious

18
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:27,691
But if she takes care of herself,
she should live for many years

19
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,589
You have a big part to play

20
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,924
Yes. I know what I must do

21
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,934
She's my number one priority now

22
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,467
I couldn't live without her

23
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,609
Do you still have that house
near Perrouze?

24
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:45,577
Yes...

25
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:50,847
I almost had to sell it.
The last remains of the Marnac estate

26
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,319
My family's final resting place

27
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,851
Now, of course,
I don't need the money

28
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,989
Me, once a poor architect...

29
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,425
Marrying one of the
richest women in the country

30
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,691
Remember how they behaved
at the wedding?

31
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,966
Like I was an ignorant peasant

32
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,564
A fortune seeker

33
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,502
Paul, you have to move on.
Forget about them

34
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,511
Really...
You think it's that easy?

35
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:24,710
You've done well for yourself.
Made a lot of money

36
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,215
Everyone respects you

37
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,613
Come, come...

38
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:32,215
Stop tormenting yourself.
Now listen...

39
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,253
That house is ideal for your wife

40
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,222
It's quiet there, the air is clean

41
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,865
It's in the mountains,
but not too far above sea level

42
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,834
She might not like it

43
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,269
It's not exactly luxurious there

44
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,970
But it would be good for her.
Try to convince her

45
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,241
I will, but she never
went there before

46
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,212
I always had to go alone

47
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:04,015
You know, to check
the state of the place occasionally

48
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,816
...that sort of thing

49
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:10,060
Don't worry, we'll think up
some way of getting her there

50
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,795
Paul...

51
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,968
Pierre says that you need
peace and quiet

52
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,270
He suggests my holiday home

53
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,443
So I get to see that place at last

54
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:32,209
We'll leave tomorrow.
Soon you'll forget all about Paris

55
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,886
Very good, Mr Marnac, sir.
Whatever you say...

56
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,100
What a face that guy has.
Not what you'd call handsome

57
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,100
Sort of mean looking

58
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,607
Auntie, those old stories about him,
are they true?

59
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,312
Of course they are

60
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,551
Your grandmother herself
saw those weapons...

61
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:07,947
...covered in blood

62
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,558
Blood stains that stay fresh
for 500 years?

63
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,384
Hard to believe

64
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,723
The legend says Alaric de Marnac
slew his wife...

65
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,230
and three of her five children

66
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,596
Only the two he spared were his

67
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,963
What a monster

68
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,371
Then he took to witchcraft
and devil worship

69
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,841
Finally he went mad

70
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,805
He committed many horrid crimes

71
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,549
He even drank human blood

72
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,181
And his disciples did
as he commanded

73
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:49,224
Finally he was brought to trial
and the king ordered him imprisoned

74
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,191
There was a huge battle

75
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,195
Alaric was killed
by his wife's brother...

76
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,431
...with an arrow through his heart

77
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,131
He was damned then to eternal torment

78
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,067
Just an old wive's tale

79
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:04,976
Why?

80
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,974
Really auntie,
it's too ridiculous

81
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,374
What's so terrible about her
having a lover?

82
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:18,021
I'm not trying to excuse him,
but he found her in another man's arms

83
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,120
So?
If every man killed his wife...

84
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,952
because their marriage
wasn't working...

85
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,291
Where would we be?

86
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,859
And that beast killed children

87
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,604
No matter whose they were,
they were innocent kids

88
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,466
He died in mortal sin

89
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,472
His soul can never find peace

90
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,806
People must have been really dumb
back then

91
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,408
Enough talk

92
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,548
We have a lot of work to do
upstairs

93
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:47,610
Come on!

94
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,018
Don't you give me that look

95
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,056
I'm not your wife!

96
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,962
Tonight we'll be in Perrouze

97
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,203
I'm happy, Genevieve

98
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,769
At last you'll see my holiday home

99
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,107
I have such happy memories
of childhood days there

100
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,477
Memories I want to share
with you

101
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,915
Maville's great.
She's been like a mother to me

102
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,961
I know you'll like her

103
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,832
Genevieve, my love,
I know you'll get better here

104
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,092
We can walk in the woods,
visit the sights

105
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,032
We'll be really happy here

106
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,368
Paul, as long as you're here,
that's all that matters

107
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,980
- Is this him?
- Yes, that's right

108
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,955
Not bad looking

109
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,326
What's he like now?

110
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,723
Like that picture

111
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,922
It says 1965...

112
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,858
He looks about 30

113
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,998
I'm good at ages

114
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,298
So he's getting on now

115
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,273
You know...

116
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,575
He looks a bit like that man
in the painting

117
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,375
I hope he's not
such a beast

118
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,584
Look, I brought you here to help me

119
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,578
Not to gossip all day

120
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,951
All right! Keep your hair on

121
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,919
Get to work

122
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,291
I want everything gleaming!

123
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,759
I'm glad the house
will finally be lived in

124
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,440
Maville wrote and asked if her niece
could move in with her

125
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,670
She's a young girl
with no other family

126
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,505
We can use some help
around the place

127
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,082
I'm glad I agreed to come

128
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,481
I feel we're going to be very happy
here

129
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,951
I wish I'd come before

130
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,016
Don't worry.
We'll make up for lost time

131
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,921
Now I'm starting to see
how shallow my life was in the city

132
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:51,001
Surrounded by false friends
only there for the money... not for me

133
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,704
It was all so superficial

134
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,634
This is our new life

135
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,243
But for how long?

136
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,705
We'll work it out together

137
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,877
Now what's up?

138
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,688
I think we're out of gas

139
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,756
What a disaster.
What are we going to do?

140
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,893
There's a town not far back

141
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,326
I'll get some there

142
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,158
I'll come

143
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,594
No, it's too far for you

144
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,469
Can't we wait?

145
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,896
A car might come by

146
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,798
Not much traffic come this way

147
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,911
It's the scenic route.
That's why I chose this road

148
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:34,909
Damn it...

149
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,306
Don't leave me here

150
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,916
I won't be long.
Relax

151
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,218
Don't worry

152
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,310
Put the radio on.
Just close your eyes and relax

153
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,478
You'll be fine

154
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:07,908
See you soon

155
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,978
So his wife's really ill?

156
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,159
Heart problems.
She's coming here to rest

157
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:26,459
She'll stay here
when he goes to Paris on business

158
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,424
Then we'll have to look after her

159
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:36,068
Great! Not just servants
but nurses too

160
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,143
Listen, we don't do what we want,
but what we're paid to do

161
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,214
Maybe I was better of
in that school in Toulouse...

162
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,075
That school was a jail

163
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,487
Now you're my responsibility

164
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,481
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to upset you

165
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,491
Think before you speak

166
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,963
You're just like your mother.
God rest her

167
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,600
Tell me about her

168
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,771
She was my sister,
but totally different from me

169
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,638
Auntie,
I promise I'll try to be good

170
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,314
Really

171
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,279
I know, Julie.
Deep down you're a good girl

172
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,966
Don't you dare move

173
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,028
Get out

174
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,542
Just behave and you'll be fine

175
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,877
Get the luggage out

176
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,384
Are you mad, stopping out here?

177
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,883
This place is like the jungle

178
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,087
Survival of the fittest

179
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,894
Come on lady

180
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:15,537
We only want to see
if you've got anything worth having

181
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,841
You're rich and we're poor

182
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,637
We're just trying
to even out the odds

183
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,048
Shit! Let's go

184
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,145
This way, come on

185
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,425
Paul! Be careful

186
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,461
I'm worried

187
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,636
They should be here by now

188
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:58,941
It's very late

189
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,107
Midnight...

190
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,713
Listen to that wind

191
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,978
All through the house

192
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:13,653
The sort of night when
Alaric de Marnac rises from his tomb

193
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,755
There's someone

194
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,232
Downstairs...
at the servant's door

195
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,436
Who could it be?

196
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:33,203
Who else? Obviously the master.
He's here

197
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,804
He finally arrived.
Come on

198
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,394
I'm so glad to see you at last.
What happened?

199
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,166
- We had an incident
- An incident?

200
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,342
I had to go to the police
in town

201
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,609
Police!

202
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,610
Maville, don't worry.
It's all sorted now

203
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,511
And your wife?

204
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,577
In the car.
Waiting with the luggage

205
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,350
This is my niece, Julie

206
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,893
Pleased to meet you, Julie

207
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,892
Me too, sir

208
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:35,966
Let's go

209
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,897
I really like Maville

210
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,333
I know we'll get along great

211
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:07,931
I told you so

212
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,505
She'll take really good care of you

213
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,401
You'll see

214
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,474
Her niece is a pretty girl

215
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,303
But I didn't like her

216
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,749
Give her a chance.
We only just met her

217
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,379
I know, but there was something
I didn't like about her

218
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,454
Something deep down inside her

219
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,521
Maville has her faults too

220
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,128
Like what?

221
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,458
She tells stories

222
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,063
Stories of ghosts
and horrible monsters

223
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,335
Used to give me nightmares
when I was a kid

224
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,835
Lots of them
were about this ancestor of mine

225
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:51,505
Sounds like that book Rebecca.
Do you remember it?

226
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,117
Except here,
Maville is a good housekeeper

227
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,778
In the book, the monster was
a beautiful woman

228
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,956
Here it's the ghost of a knight
who turns up every now and then

229
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,822
I never saw him, of course

230
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,428
Who was he?

231
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:10,324
Alaric de Marnac.
The man in the painting

232
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,194
He looks like you

233
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:17,298
Hardly surprising,
since we are related

234
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,804
Maville used to scare me with him

235
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,737
He has a satanic look

236
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,778
It freezes the soul

237
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,150
Nothing like you, thank God!

238
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,547
Well, let's talk about happier things

239
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,994
I have no problems
with old legends

240
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,722
What happened earlier was real

241
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,198
I thought those thugs
were going to kill us

242
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,493
It was horrible

243
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,801
Darling, I'm here to protect you

244
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,132
Yes...

245
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,276
And as long as you are,
I won't worry

246
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,418
Julie, calm down

247
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,061
It's me... Paul

248
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,960
You were screaming

249
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,203
I had a nightmare

250
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,032
That man in the painting
came to life

251
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,799
He tried to kill me

252
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,281
I heard a scream
and came to see what it was

253
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,720
I know.
I heard it too

254
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,627
I dreamed about that picture

255
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,888
It's you and your horror stories

256
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,397
Well... good night

257
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,865
Goodnight.
I'm sorry, sir

258
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,401
Good night

259
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,182
It's wonderful

260
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,390
Julie, every day I feel better

261
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,732
A month since we came
and it seems like yesterday

262
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,466
How time has flown by

263
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,599
I'm glad you feel better

264
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,537
I feel stronger every day

265
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:26,844
And I'll tell you a secret...

266
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,581
I'm falling in love with my husband
all over again

267
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:40,318
Maville is nice, of course
but do you know what?

268
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,024
I didn't like you at first

269
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,059
Now I feel really close to you

270
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,664
I didn't like you either

271
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,598
I hope you do now

272
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,571
Of course I do.
I'm really glad we met

273
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,682
<i>Dear Pierre...I am happy to say
that Genevieve is getting better</i>

274
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:10,316
<i>The clean air, the slow pace of life,
it really seems to be good for her</i>

275
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,086
<i>Every day she gets stronger</i>

276
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,356
<i>I really hope it lasts</i>

277
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:23,330
<i>On the way here something happened
that could have been serious</i>

278
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,729
<i>I was worried about Genevieve
and didn't think she would recover</i>

279
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,148
<i>But to my great surprise
she didn't ask to go back to Paris</i>

280
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,473
<i>But she's really enjoying it here now</i>

281
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,052
<i>Truly, my life has never been better</i>

282
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,495
I think things really started
to go wrong for me at school

283
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,662
My dad worked in a factory
in Toulouse

284
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,327
He got in a mess
and killed himself

285
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,741
My mother was an alcoholic
who died in a car crash

286
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,736
They put me in a reform school

287
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,740
A bad place.
Worse than jail

288
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,780
My aunt came and rescued me

289
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,418
Julie, you poor girl

290
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,552
I've wasted too much time.
Now I want to do things

291
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,653
I won't be a maid all my life

292
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,992
Look at Maville, she's grown old here

293
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:33,430
She's wasted the best years
of her life in this place

294
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,403
Her ambitions never went
beyond these mountains

295
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,104
Julie, I want to help you
find your dreams

296
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,474
Thank you, madame

297
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:54,619
Hello?

298
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,189
Ah, yes

299
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,319
OK...
The day after tomorrow

300
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,928
Yes...
I'll come to Perrouze

301
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,036
Anything wrong?

302
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:20,049
It's the police. They have
some information about that robbery

303
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,955
They want to see me.
I have to go into town

304
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,321
I've never come here before

305
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,889
It's a gloomy place

306
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,289
This is where Alaric de Marnac
is buried

307
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,061
The man in the picture?

308
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:36,933
Yes

309
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,793
He was a total monster

310
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:43,407
This house is the site
of his former castle

311
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,545
All I know about him
is what my husband told me

312
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,474
He killed his wife
for being unfaithful

313
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,883
The legend says
he rises from his tomb

314
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,312
to punish any Marnac woman
who lives here

315
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:03,554
He comes back every hundred years

316
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,428
What a horrible story

317
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,900
They say he's due to return soon

318
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,132
I suppose you'd be his first victim

319
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,433
But don't worry

320
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,832
It's only a legend

321
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,539
An old wives' tale...

322
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,768
Come on,
I want to show you something

323
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,027
Here's his grave

324
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:48,365
Alaric de Marnac.
1515 to 1565

325
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,873
"Only he
will hear the trumpet of Hell..."

326
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,772
"Only the Devil will be his friend"

327
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,210
Here, take this

328
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,280
I don't understand

329
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:37,914
I told them to stop all this nonsense
about Alaric de Marnac

330
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,088
And now this

331
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,355
It was horrible... that snake.
It was such a shock

332
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,892
That stupid girl's fault!

333
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,464
I'm kicking her out

334
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,167
Paul, please don't

335
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,870
Pail, let's make love tonight

336
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,836
Well... I don't know

337
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,212
Go on! Get out of here!

338
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,286
What did the police want?

339
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,632
To show me some pictures

340
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,300
See if I could identify
those thugs

341
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:00,594
Did you?

342
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:05,008
Yes...
seems they were quite well known

343
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:09,445
Looks like they might
catch them soon

344
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,271
Maybe even tonight

345
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,283
Paul, how long will you be in Paris?

346
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,815
Shouldn't be more than
3 or 4 days

347
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,555
I won't stay long

348
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,721
Please, darling.
Don't worry

349
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,528
I'll be back before you know it

350
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,523
And you've got Maville

351
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,998
I know. I'm being silly

352
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,576
I'll be as quick as I can be

353
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,382
I won't be gone long

354
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,478
Please don't be.
I need you

355
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,215
Genevieve, just take care of yourself

356
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,984
Remember, I love you

357
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:01,429
Paul, it's just that sometimes...
I get depressed

358
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,223
But darling...

359
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,793
Don't worry, I'll be all right

360
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,497
But hurry back

361
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,933
I will

362
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,512
Where's Julie?
I haven't seen her all day

363
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,649
She's in bed.
She had a headache

364
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,613
I think she's got a cold

365
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:01,823
Dear me, what a night.
It's going to be stormy

366
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:09,722
Storms round here can be bad.
Sometimes the power goes down

367
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,399
I think I'll go up to bed

368
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,802
I'll go with you

369
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,008
No, please. I'm all right

370
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,745
Very well.
But if you need me for anything...

371
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,776
...just call

372
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:26,411
The bell in your room
also rings in the kitchen

373
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,412
Thank you, Maville.
Goodnight

374
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,052
Goodnight. Sleep well

375
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:36,717
The knight...

376
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,090
Death...

377
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,965
God bless us

378
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,556
How is she doctor?

379
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,799
I think she's over the worst of it

380
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,367
I gave her a sedative

381
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,871
It's a heart problem

382
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,631
That's out of my league

383
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,272
When's Mr Marnac back?

384
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,673
Probably tomorrow

385
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,949
I'll talk to him about it

386
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,820
She might have to see someone
in Paris

387
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:57,885
Well, I must be off.
I have another call to make

388
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,324
I'll show you out

389
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,365
Stay here till I get back

390
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:29,554
She says it was a snake in her bed.
And she saw the knight

391
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,455
Then the lights went out

392
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:36,599
But the electric company say
there was no power cut last night

393
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,098
So it's impossible

394
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:41,831
I told you and Julie
to keep an eye on her

395
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,202
Julie was ill in bed

396
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,639
And where were you, Maville?

397
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,813
She didn't want me with her.
I stayed in the kitchen

398
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:54,915
I tried to keep awake,
but somehow I still fell asleep

399
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,817
This is all wrong.
I don't like it at all

400
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:04,952
Julie, sick; you asleep.
And my wife left alone here

401
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,193
What do you mean?

402
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,799
Nothing, I'm just thinking out loud

403
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,195
But I don't like it

404
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,264
Good evening, sir

405
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,470
Hello, Julie.
How's my wife?

406
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,038
Much better. She's asleep

407
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,911
Believe me, Paul. It wasn't a dream.
It was real

408
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,723
That's impossible.
That story is just a legend

409
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,416
I saw him, I tell you

410
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,627
It was just a nightmare.
Forget it

411
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,764
Don't take it so seriously...
please

412
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:47,063
I know you're right.
I'll try to be strong

413
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,639
Good. We'll go back to Paris soon

414
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:53,137
I'll have Pierre run some more tests

415
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,713
Tomorrow I must see the police
in Perrouze again

416
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:58,609
Again?

417
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,250
I think it's just routine

418
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,163
Come in

419
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,070
Here's your dinner

420
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,802
I'm not hungry

421
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,070
But you must eat

422
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,707
And Maville's made something special

423
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,777
Why did my husband have to go
back to the police?

424
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:43,558
I think they might have found
those men who tried to rob you

425
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,527
They've been arrested?

426
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,630
Not exactly, no

427
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:48,961
What do you mean?

428
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:54,103
I believe they were killed
resisting arrest

429
00:42:54,705 --> 00:43:00,575
Maybe he went to identify
the bodies

430
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,712
Now try to eat something

431
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,077
Come on, I know you'll like it

432
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:12,582
It's your favorite.
And Maville cooked it specially

433
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:19,795
Blood!

434
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,497
What is it, Madam?
What's wrong?

435
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,030
It's only...
Only a fish

436
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,334
Take it away!

437
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,614
Go on, take a look.
It's nothing...

438
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,778
Mireille, you shouldn't have come.
It's crazy

439
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,141
People know me here

440
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,575
I had to come.
I had to know what was going on

441
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,586
I told you not to contact me.
Not to follow me

442
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,156
You left so suddenly

443
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,586
I'm sorry, but you must be patient

444
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,122
Listen, Paul Marnac...

445
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:30,230
I know about you.
I could cause you a lot of trouble

446
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:34,598
I've worked for you
for a long time

447
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,000
I know all about your business

448
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:41,142
Maybe more than I should

449
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,207
Are you threatening me?

450
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,841
A friendly warning

451
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,811
Just don't forget about me.
Alright?

452
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:49,317
Blackmail...

453
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:50,976
Call it what you like

454
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,252
You've got no class

455
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,291
I found you in the gutter
and you're still trash

456
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,659
I gave you five years of my life

457
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,263
You always knew what I wanted

458
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,204
Just be patient

459
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:16,007
Soon we'll have everything
we planned for

460
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:16,770
I promise

461
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:25,521
Maville, I have a bad feeling

462
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,388
I sense that my life
will soon be over

463
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,523
Oh, Madam...

464
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,827
When I die,
I'm going to die alone

465
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,032
Please don't say such things

466
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:43,505
My heart is sick
and now my mind is too

467
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,506
I see things that aren't really there

468
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,107
- Maybe I'm going mad, Maville
- Come now...

469
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,750
Completely mad

470
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,438
It's 9 o'clock.
Where's Paul got to?

471
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:55,873
Don't worry,
I'm sure he'll be back soon

472
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,510
Poor Paul.
I've not been easy to live with

473
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,945
First of all my moods
and depressions

474
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,616
And now this illness

475
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:10,717
But I do love him

476
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,787
I always have...
I always will

477
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,323
And he loves you too

478
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,580
Paul? Is that you?

479
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:29,718
Paul! Maville...
Please help me!

480
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,333
Take the body upstairs

481
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,335
We'll settle up later

482
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,809
From Paul to Genevieve,
with all my love

483
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,343
On our fifth wedding anniversary

484
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:38,695
I couldn't do anything.
She never even woke up

485
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,362
Cardiac arrest in her sleep

486
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:45,635
At least she didn't suffer.
I'll fill out the death certificate

487
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:00,055
Now what can I do?
I feel so empty

488
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:01,982
I'll take care of things

489
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,286
Thank you, doctor

490
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:06,225
It's no trouble

491
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:37,752
Poor lady.
How sad to die alone

492
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:22,763
Paul, do I look good?

493
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,402
Fantastic

494
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,038
Better than her?

495
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:32,206
Well?

496
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,651
Of course, much better

497
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,748
You look great

498
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:28,228
That first time I saw you I knew
my life would be empty without you

499
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,903
And I knew I would kill
to make you mine

500
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,606
How long will you be in Paris?

501
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,941
Long enough to arrange things

502
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:43,952
Getting the funeral sorted.
Telling all the friends and family

503
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,653
Then the legal stuff
has to be sorted

504
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:51,390
The factories, the houses,
the business, the bank accounts

505
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:52,789
It's all mine now!

506
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,831
Soon it will be all ours

507
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,730
Yes, very soon.
When you're my wife

508
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:58,321
Hello lover

509
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,689
I knew you'd be back

510
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,261
I have some things to pick up

511
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,590
Your pyjamas?

512
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,904
The silk robe I gave you
on your birthday?

513
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,163
I told you, it's not good
for us to meet right now

514
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,769
Nobody saw me.
I'm very discrete

515
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:16,542
The perfect mistress

516
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,771
But I'm tired of being perfect

517
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:25,379
At least say you're happy to see me

518
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:30,625
Listen, Mireille,
it's all going according to plan

519
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:35,459
In a few days I must return
to the country

520
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:39,495
A few things to sort out there.
Then we can be together at last

521
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:04,621
<i>Just a body.
No class...no style</i>

522
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:08,322
<i>What a mess I'm in</i>

523
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,111
<i>You sleep well, my girl</i>

524
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:06,588
<i>You think you've finally got me
where you want me...</i>

525
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,090
<i>But your death will solve my problems</i>

526
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,090
<i>Your death...</i>

527
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,661
Paul, can't you sleep?

528
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:25,064
No... l'm a little restless

529
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:54,096
Maurice, at last

530
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,431
Drink some coffee.
It'll do you good

531
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:08,013
Christ in heaven knows,
I'm dying inside

532
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:09,114
What's wrong, Paul?

533
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,920
Nothing. Just thinking out loud

534
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:15,848
I know this is hard for you.
Let me help

535
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,093
It's like a poem

536
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,426
A poem that doesn't rhyme

537
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,494
Death is the only solution

538
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,294
I'm trapped

539
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:26,665
But I must be myself

540
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,334
I don't understand you.
What is it?

541
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,196
Sometimes I'm hard to understand

542
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:35,240
But if the poem doesn't rhyme...
If it doesn't fit in the house...

543
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,975
Now the house is empty

544
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,079
I'm here for you.
I'll always be here

545
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,510
We'll work it out together

546
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:45,577
Yes, of course we will

547
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,020
Paul, please...

548
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:50,320
Can I come to the country with you?

549
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:51,252
No, Mireille

550
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,662
It's not possible right now

551
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:54,928
We have to wait

552
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,237
We're safe here

553
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,166
My aunt sleeps like a log

554
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:09,068
I usually slip some pills
in her milk

555
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,871
Knocks her out for hours

556
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,016
So it's just you two?

557
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,821
The gardener comes every two weeks

558
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,218
But he never talks

559
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:26,026
Apparently he's worked here
more than 30 years

560
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,026
He's deaf as a post

561
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:36,195
Maurice, I really want this

562
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,631
lt'll take time,
but we can be rich

563
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:40,873
Really rich...

564
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:42,738
Important people

565
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,340
I hope so

566
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:46,373
Trust me

567
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,890
<i>Mireille, damn her!</i>

568
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,153
<i>What to do?</i>

569
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,891
<i>I must find a way out</i>

570
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,370
Where's Maville?

571
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,509
In town. She'll be a while

572
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:23,368
Then we have time

573
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:46,758
It's all fine.
Nobody suspects anything

574
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,632
When I first heard that story
of the knight

575
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:55,731
I had nightmares
- do you remember?

576
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,771
Now he's like an old friend

577
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:05,314
The perfect partner in crime.
A partner who makes no demands

578
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,310
What shall we do about Maville?

579
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:11,484
Nothing.
She won't be a problem

580
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:18,156
If she is, just give her some pills
and she'll sleep like a baby

581
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:21,888
I don't know.
You might be right

582
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:26,227
Of course I am.
I've known her since I was a kid

583
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:33,466
Your wife was a tough bitch,
she took a lot of scaring

584
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:39,080
Julie, I bought something from Paris

585
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,047
What?

586
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:46,684
I hope you like it

587
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,386
Paul! It's beautiful

588
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,126
Anything for you, Julie

589
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:12,572
How could you do such a thing, sir?

590
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:17,485
I don't know.
Sometimes we act on impulse, Maville

591
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,554
Julie is a bad girl.
She has no conscience

592
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:24,051
I think she drove her father
to suicide

593
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:28,357
She's taken drugs,
been a prostitute

594
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,162
She used to hang around
with a thug called Maurice

595
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,393
A drug addict
who'd been in jail many times

596
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:38,363
He was her lover.
She ended up in reform school

597
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,108
I convinced the judge
to let her stay with me

598
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:42,934
I thought I could change her

599
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,405
I really did try

600
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:49,741
But all I did
was bring evil into this house

601
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:55,455
I decided to kill my wife
long before I set eyes on Julie

602
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,190
I hated her...

603
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,519
Her superior ways, her demands,
her impossible moods

604
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:03,961
How her friends used to laugh at me

605
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,865
She deserved to die

606
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:10,471
But she really loved you.
She told me that many times

607
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:15,806
When she got ill she changed,
because she needed me

608
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,669
Then I hated her even more

609
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,941
But her illness gave me
the perfect solution

610
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,744
You've changed.
I no longer know you

611
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,679
You're not yourself

612
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:29,389
So what are you going to do?

613
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,116
You're like a son to me

614
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:34,192
I watched you being born
and growing up

615
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,325
But I don't think I can forgive this

616
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:38,500
I can't...

617
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:12,129
Yes? No, he's already left

618
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:17,462
I don't know. I told you

619
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:21,805
All right, I'll give him the message

620
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:23,469
Mireille?

621
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:27,476
Yes. Says she's coming here
to see you

622
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,211
Damn bitch!
She's real trouble

623
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,011
Don't worry.
Just let her come

624
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:24,170
I hated doing that.
Maville was a good woman

625
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,238
But she had a conscience

626
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,035
And because of that,
she was dangerous

627
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,446
We should call the ambulance

628
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:43,519
Tell them about Maville's...
terrible accident

629
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:50,565
Wait, she's not dead yet

630
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:56,865
Now what can we do?

631
01:13:58,367 --> 01:13:59,959
I'll get that

632
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:33,357
Is Mr Marnac in?

633
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,536
No, he's not

634
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:36,637
I'll wait. I need to see him

635
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:37,701
It's important

636
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:53,283
Hold on, where are you going?

637
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:43,870
Clean it all well.
There must be no traces

638
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,809
The doctor and the police
might be dumb...

639
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,874
But we can't take chances

640
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:51,973
Don't worry. I'll do a good job

641
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:56,046
I'll dump the car in the lake
tonight

642
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:58,349
Could anyone know she's here?

643
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:04,518
She was always very discrete.
Never discussed our affair

644
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,823
No, there's nothing to worry about

645
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:07,528
OK...

646
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,064
First I'll hide the car

647
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:12,393
Then we'll put Maville
back on the stairs

648
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:13,759
And call the cops

649
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,930
Along come
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson...

650
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,574
and believe everything we tell them

651
01:16:20,843 --> 01:16:23,903
Keep calm, Julie,
and everything will be fine

652
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:25,546
Our luck's in

653
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,883
I am calm, lover...

654
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,349
...very calm

655
01:16:36,392 --> 01:16:38,383
<i>I thought the honeymoon
would never end</i>

656
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:40,518
<i>Thank God it has</i>

657
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:44,566
<i>That bastard wanted it
day and night</i>

658
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,828
<i>And every time I felt more sick</i>

659
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:48,603
<i>Every time I just hated him more</i>

660
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,696
<i>He's such a kid,
he's easy to fool</i>

661
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,606
<i>I can make him do anything</i>

662
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,879
<i>Soon we're going to be very rich</i>

663
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:03,384
<i>After the honeymoon,
I made him come back here</i>

664
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:05,581
<i>That makes ourjob easier</i>

665
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:08,513
<i>Soon we can be together, Maurice</i>

666
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:10,818
<i>I love you...Julie</i>

667
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,793
Thanks, it's cold in this house

668
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,563
It's been empty for a long time now

669
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,526
Tomorrow I'll call the engineer in

670
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,408
To see if we can
get the heating fixed up

671
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:06,613
Come on, get in the bath with me...

672
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,908
You're all wet! Stop it

673
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:15,019
The big bad dragon will leave you be,
but you have to scrub my back

674
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:25,664
Julie, we'll always be together,
know why?

675
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:26,490
Why?

676
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:30,635
Because you and me, we're both alike
- two monsters

677
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,397
Aren't I right?

678
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,365
Well... maybe you are

679
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:38,103
And sometimes
even monsters need love

680
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,574
You're very deep tonight

681
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:50,020
Fuck you!

682
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:12,310
We're both evil...
But I'm more evil than you, idiot

683
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:58,342
Maurice?

684
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,413
It's all over, my love

685
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,717
I played the part
of the grieving widow

686
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:07,560
I was perfect

687
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:09,731
Do you have the tickets?

688
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:13,530
Tomorrow then,
to New York

689
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,294
I really need a holiday

690
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:18,263
I earned it, right?

691
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:21,440
I'll be waiting

692
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,310
Yes... at dawn

693
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,303
Best no-one sees us

694
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:27,706
Bye now. I love you

695
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:14,486
What's going on?

696
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,756
I'm starting to see things

697
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,752
Must get out of here

698
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:13,634
Hello? Who's there?

699
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:15,503
Say something

700
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,979
Somebody's trying to scare me,
that's it!

701
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:26,345
Trying to drive me crazy

702
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,552
It's all in my mind

703
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:35,986
This is my house

704
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,556
They can't get me

705
01:25:41,203 --> 01:25:43,603
Maurice! It must be...

706
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:10,755
I must escape

707
01:26:11,066 --> 01:26:12,328
Get out of here...
