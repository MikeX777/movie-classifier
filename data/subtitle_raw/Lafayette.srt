1
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:19,580
1776.

2
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,970
The British colonies of America
revolted against the crown.

3
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:30,944
Under a very young American
flag, which still has 13 stars,

4
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:33,540
those who are called rebels,

5
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:37,117
fiercely fighting for
their independence.

6
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:48,139
But a powerful and
organized British army

7
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,370
American General Washington

8
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:55,584
can oppose only the militia -
poorly equipped and poorly trained.

9
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:17,294
Catastrophically there is not
enough weapons, food, clothes.

10
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:24,604
Despite the courage and enthusiasm,

11
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:28,118
the insurgents pursue
defeats and setbacks,

12
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:30,683
and many of them have
already been exterminated.

13
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:33,665
- Ephraim Patnam!
- Missing!

14
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,365
- James Thomas Hight!
- Missing!

15
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,846
- Fight Halston!
- It's gone!

16
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:39,473
- Jonathan Mitchell!
- Killed for freedom!

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,893
But the desire to win
has not gone anywhere.

18
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:48,086
The young nation, led by its leader Washington,
was giving birth to its first heroes.

19
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:52,309
{\ a9} Nathan Hale,
convicted of treason...

20
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:57,909
and sentenced
to death by hanging.

21
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:02,706
Nathan Hale, do you want to
say something before the execution?

22
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,806
Yes!

23
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:07,565
I'm sorry that I have only one
life to give it for my Motherland.

24
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,442
Bring the sentence to execution!

25
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:28,128
However, in the evenings
after some battles,

26
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,485
Washington felt like
overwhelming responsibility.

27
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:35,510
Heavy pressure on his strong
shoulders the former farmer.

28
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,313
Lord, give me strength,

29
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,343
to withstand all these
troubles and cruelties.

30
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,477
Lord, support the faith
in me of my compatriots

31
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:56,720
and help us achieve peace.

32
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,438
Forgive me, sir, your presence
in the General Staff is required.

33
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:10,755
General Washington.

34
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,049
My name is Saylis Dean, sir.

35
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:16,177
Hello, sir.
Do you want to sit down?

36
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,908
Thank you sir.

37
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:26,954
General Washington,
Congress is sending me to France.

38
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:30,864
Mr. Benjamin Franklin, of course -
their official representative.

39
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:34,738
My work is the purchase of weapons, ammunition
and the recruitment of officers for the army.

40
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:39,806
So, as you can see, my task -
more in the shadows... inconspicuous.

41
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:42,726
May God help you
in your endeavors, sir!

42
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,838
If there is a country that can help us, -
this is France.

43
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,836
They said that our business
there is very supportive.

44
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,922
But...

45
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,936
Did Congress send you
to me with this good news?

46
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,022
No.

47
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,287
No, I came to you of my own free will.

48
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,727
I would be very surprised.

49
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:08,163
These gentlemen do not
know the rules of courtesy.

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,037
It's much better to have a people
on your side, not its representatives.

51
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:14,665
And the people are on your side, sir.

52
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,385
Mr. Dean,

53
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:21,130
Tell me, in France, that the
situation here can not be worse.

54
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:23,507
But also tell them...

55
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,593
without a fleet,

56
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,378
officers, without weapons,

57
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,849
provisions...

58
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,311
We will fight to the end!

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,929
God willing!

60
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:41,454
<i>LAFAYETT.</i>

61
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:23,542
"LA FAYETT"

62
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:55,749
In Paris, in the famous
tavern "Wooden Sword",

63
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,857
gathered a brilliant noisy youth,
carried away with new ideas.

64
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:13,559
Now it's your turn,
my dear marquis!

65
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:19,129
Thank you. You have discouraged
me from drinking, dear Count.

66
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:20,628
Gentlemen!

67
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,622
Taking advantage of the freedom
of opinion that is so dear to us,

68
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:29,323
I declare that the Marquis de La
Fayette, who is so bold on the tongue,

69
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:32,203
not so strong in two other things:

70
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,153
In wine and in women!

71
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:36,624
No more than one glass,
no more than one woman!

72
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:39,429
His wife is charming, but
she is still a child!

73
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,567
Challenge accepted!

74
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,684
He drinks! He drinks!

75
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:50,931
Bottoms Up! Bottoms Up!

76
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,380
He drank it!

77
00:06:58,313 --> 00:06:59,867
This must be washed!

78
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,550
This must be washed!

79
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,792
Gentlemen, good evening!

80
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:12,161
I brought you a gift from our
friend, Benjamin Franklin.

81
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:17,406
Portrait of the army commander of the rebels,
General George Washington in his youth!

82
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:19,335
Bravo!

83
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,307
Long live America!

84
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,136
Uh, no! No! It's impossible!

85
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,818
I have already allowed you and your friends
to hang here Rousseau, Diderot and Voltaire!

86
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,926
Writers do not care about the police. But
not the general! I will have problems!

87
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,074
Silence, friend!

88
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,192
The golden words of our innkeeper!

89
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:45,205
Thank God, the idiot police
is not afraid of writers.

90
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:47,416
But do not be writers -
there would be no generals!

91
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:50,179
The pen offers - the sword does!

92
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:55,278
The place of General Washington - between
Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Mr. Voltaire.

93
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,958
Let there and remains. Freedom!

94
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:03,381
Mr. Marquis, you know that every evening spies
come here, disguised as petty bourgeoises.

95
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,201
Because of you they will
throw me into the Bastille!

96
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:09,189
I'll go with you and ask for
the same camera as you.

97
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:11,399
"Er, no, listen..."
- Equality!

98
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:15,539
Friends! Raise the glasses
for the heroic rebels

99
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,499
and for General Washington!

100
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,961
If he is so rich, why
is he a revolutionary?

101
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:25,247
So it is necessary! Otherwise, what
will we do to make a revolution?

102
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:30,826
Mr. Marquis, there is a bastard!

103
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:33,026
Come here, mister gendarme!

104
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:38,114
Despite your clothes of a petty bourgeois,
we, as you can see, have found out! Come on!

105
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:42,682
Go, swing with us for the
victory of the rebels!

106
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,048
Brotherhood!

107
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,873
And then report to Mr. Morp.

108
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:49,585
You are mistaken, monsieur!
My name is Sayles Dean.

109
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,587
I am a citizen of America.

110
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,621
I report only to
General Washington.

111
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,009
Welcome! Welcome!

112
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:00,825
Well, tell me, Mr. Dean!

113
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:03,380
I came to Paris to
recruit volunteers.

114
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:06,300
I was correctly informed
by sending here.

115
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:09,292
Yes, monsieur, we are all volunteers here.
When are we going?

116
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:12,973
That's it, monsieur!
You are in a hurry even more than me!

117
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,467
I must draft contracts for
the service of Mr. Franklin,

118
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,011
find a ship, weapons...

119
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:20,158
How are you doing?

120
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:23,369
General Washington asked me to
convey that everything is very bad,

121
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,654
but we will fight to the last.

122
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,211
Mr. Dean, my friends and I are officers
of His Majesty the King of France.

123
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,025
For us here, too, everything will be bad.

124
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:36,320
We will be prevented from
leaving, but we will leave!

125
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,573
Where, Mr. Marquis?

126
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:42,118
To America, Mr. Gendarme!

127
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:46,039
Your honesty facilitates my task, Mr.
Marquis.

128
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:48,166
Your task is to spy and report!

129
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:49,824
So go, report!

130
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:52,660
Here you are in a public place.

131
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:55,465
While there is order, you
have no right to interfere.

132
00:09:56,737 --> 00:10:00,293
Washington! "He's an English general...
he's an Englishman."

133
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,453
"Are you taking me for a fool?"
"How can you do that!"

134
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:04,808
Dispose of!

135
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:15,840
Tell me thank you, mister gendarme.
You almost committed a crime.

136
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:17,988
It's you, monsieur, now you are doing it!

137
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:21,509
Wearing one of the most notable names of the
kingdom and serving as a sword to the king,

138
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:23,473
you have no right
to dispose of it!

139
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,954
Lift it up, monsieur.

140
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:28,614
Want to teach me a lesson?
I will teach you another.

141
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:32,024
I can not fight with
His Majesty's officer.

142
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,610
But I can arrest him!

143
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,466
Patrol, to me!

144
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,097
Your sword, monsieur!

145
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,953
And it's at the same time!

146
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:02,263
Well, it's started again!
I knew it! I warned!

147
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:05,037
For help! Help!

148
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:08,916
And all because of the picture!

149
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:15,277
Oh, it's well defended,
your Washington!

150
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,761
Leroy, leave it to me!
Leave him to me!

151
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:23,619
The killers! The executioners!

152
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:26,497
Death to the derzhimordam!

153
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:30,480
Gentlemen patrol,
raise your commander!

154
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:33,014
Who loves me - for me!

155
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,861
See you soon, Mr. Dean!

156
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:38,436
As you can see, the
beginning has been made!

157
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,380
I hope Segur wins!

158
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,242
Hooray!
"This is Count d'Artois!"

159
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,390
- I lost 100 crowns.
- And I'm 200!

160
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,768
And I'm 300. I'm even
a flatterer than you!

161
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,396
The king is so pleased that
we put on his losing brother.

162
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,234
I put 1000 ECU on it!

163
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,508
Father, I lost.

164
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,323
I, too, it seems.
All of us are good flatterers.

165
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:22,847
I confess, I did not think about that.

166
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:25,766
I'm going to pay for the wager.
Do not join Adrienne?

167
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,445
Certainly, my son-in-law.

168
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,733
The hat of Madame de Simian prevented
me from seeing the finish.

169
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,506
Me too, my father.

170
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:39,864
It's strange! This foreigner
just arrived at the races.

171
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,429
How could Gilbert
make a bet with him?

172
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,160
What ship?

173
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,100
Arrived yesterday in Le Havre.

174
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,998
This is Sussex.

175
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,646
With rifles?

176
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:53,691
With pugachami. But yes, with guns...

177
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:55,568
And what about the police?

178
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,718
Vergencin closes his eyes.

179
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,407
"Vernen!" "Sire?"

180
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:04,369
Who is this talking to the
Marquis de La Fayette?

181
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:08,790
I do not see from here, sire.

182
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:11,001
I have very poor eyesight.

183
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:15,067
This is Sileas Dean, an agent
of the Americans, sir.

184
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:18,029
You, Morpas, on the contrary,
have excellent eyesight!

185
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:21,491
Thank God, despite the years,
I'm still pretty far away.

186
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,993
Which is very useful for the minister.

187
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,642
On board the baron Kalb will rise.

188
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,185
And I?

189
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:32,669
Your contract, Mr. Marquis,
Franklin, too, signed.

190
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,129
Thank him.

191
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,548
Tell the baron of Kalbu
that I am sailing with him.

192
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,362
And what about your wife?

193
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:41,657
I'll talk to her.

194
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,368
Look at Gilbert's glowing look.

195
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,184
Do you like losing
so much, dear?

196
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:49,770
One nuance -
I like hopeless things.

197
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,837
In that case, you have
a chance, my dear!

198
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,338
Excuse me.

199
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:57,663
Gilbert!

200
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,052
Because of your fault, Aglaya and
I are treated like two horses!

201
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,680
- What does it mean?
- We are betting on, imagine!

202
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:06,308
Which will arrive...
Will arrive where?

203
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,560
Do not pretend, monster!

204
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:12,470
Excuse me. I have already arrived.

205
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:16,714
Father, I'm kidnapping my wife from you.
I need to talk to her.

206
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,424
About love! I know.

207
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,989
But first - the king.

208
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,491
Now that we've all lost to him,

209
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,244
let's see if we like him.

210
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:50,458
Do you like racing, gentlemen?
"I find them fascinating, sire."

211
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:53,044
Then why did not you participate
in them as a rider?

212
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:55,984
I have the honor of being a
royal musketeer, Your Majesty.

213
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:58,278
I'm a good rider with
only a sword in my hand.

214
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,572
Worthy answer musketeer, sir.

215
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:03,033
And what do you say, Morpah?

216
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:07,016
It will be a pity if your Majesty
will lose such officers.

217
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:10,749
Why should I lose them?
As far as I know, we are not at war.

218
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,794
No one can know whether Sire,
we are fighting or not.

219
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,213
By the way, I imposed an embargo today

220
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:18,925
on a ship loaded with
weapons for Americans.

221
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,822
I inform your Majesty.

222
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:24,159
You have chosen the wrong moment
to tell me about it, Morpah.

223
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:26,453
"Not so bad."
"Forgive me, Your Majesty,

224
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:29,435
in which case I must
inform Your Majesty,

225
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:32,147
that for my part I
gave permission!

226
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,213
Oh, gentlemen! We're here at the races!
They play, but do not decide.

227
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:39,946
Why do we need 2 ministers if they
need to be separated all the time?

228
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:42,261
Oh, Your Majesty will
be very cheerful now!

229
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,634
It is necessary to choose between
Washington and Cornwallis.

230
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,641
Again!
"Explain yourself, countess!"

231
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:50,228
In the next race Count Segur appears
under the name of Washington, and...

232
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,605
I presume, Morpa, do
you bet on England?

233
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,318
The Minister of Finance is obliged to
make reliable investments, monsieur.

234
00:15:57,527 --> 00:16:00,155
Then... 500 on Washington.

235
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,553
Good! 500 on Cornwallis.

236
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:06,036
I do not know what Washington looks
like, Sire, but Segur is so charming!

237
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,892
I put 1000 ECU on it.

238
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:10,436
And I, Madame,
should put on both.

239
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,876
This is very sensible, sir!

240
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,255
"And you, M. De La Fayette?"
"You must excuse me, Your Majesty,

241
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:20,426
I do not trust great ideas to horses.
Be they even English.

242
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,749
King, who dreams only to sleep,
the queen - just have fun,

243
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:33,356
The English, whom we
hate, but imitate,

244
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:36,838
and the war in America, which
turned into horse races!

245
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:39,633
Sire, I was just thinking...

246
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,876
This is a great opportunity
for you to make a decision!

247
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:45,858
What solution?
"About that ship!"

248
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:48,632
If Noahle wins, you will
stand on the side of Morp;

249
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,884
If Segur - on the side Verzhenna.

250
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,181
Really, madam, you always
give excellent advice.

251
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,559
Washington.

252
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:10,550
Sire, you must follow
Vergenna's advice!

253
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,010
Gilbert!

254
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,228
"A hot young man!"
"Forgive me, sire."

255
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:18,746
I told your Majesty:
Horse racing is my passion.

256
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,072
Races and rebels.

257
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,814
All 20-year-old young people,
Sire, in fact - rebels.

258
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,192
The king was joking, monsieur.

259
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:29,414
Not at all! What is said, it is said.
The ship can swim.

260
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:41,895
"The Romans had races in chariots."
"And they bet, too?"

261
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,678
Oh no. It's an English idea.

262
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,661
Do you think there is a future
for such entertainment?

263
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:49,163
This is what Mr. de Conflans maintains.

264
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:54,127
Sire! The English General Howe
led the 33,000-strong army,

265
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:56,191
defeated the insurgents.

266
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,965
Oh shit...

267
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,947
What an obliging person!

268
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,939
He saved me trouble.

269
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:07,484
It is better to bet on the
army than on one horse.

270
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:09,726
I stand on the side of Morp,

271
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,343
whose vision is definitely
better than yours.

272
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:16,056
I looked through my fingers
at secret help to the rebels.

273
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,569
From now on, I forbid it.

274
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:20,362
Gilbert!

275
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,942
<i>On the outskirts of Passy -</i>

276
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,830
<i>a small secluded house,</i>

277
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,627
<i>the house of Benjamin Franklin, the
main man of the American Revolution.</i>

278
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:39,382
Virginia and New York.

279
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:47,838
Forgive me for being late, gentlemen.

280
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:49,350
Police? "Oh, no, it's worse."

281
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,800
My father-in-law!

282
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:53,845
The news of the defeat of the Americans -
is it true or not?

283
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:55,263
True!

284
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,924
"I'm sorry, Baron, I did not notice you."
This is my role. Kalba no one notices.

285
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,335
All the bad news is true: Howe defeated
Washington, Morpa - Verzhenna.

286
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,003
And farewell, ship!

287
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:10,351
We will not have the opportunity to make
this journey together, Mr. Marquis.

288
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:13,094
"Quickly, you lose hope, Baron!"
Fast?

289
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:16,305
I waited 30 years for the
general's epaulettes,

290
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,777
no difference - German,
English or French!

291
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,019
Color is not important,
it's important to rank!

292
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:23,156
But even American
people are eluding me!

293
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:26,284
And for me, not rank is important,
but struggle, Mr. Kalb!

294
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:29,388
Better a soldier in the rebel army than
a general in the army of the king!

295
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:33,021
It's because of your age.
You will still find yourself other battles.

296
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:36,628
And this... is over!

297
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,702
<i>Finished!</i>

298
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:41,748
I do not share the opinion
of Baron Kalba here?

299
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:43,782
Not all, Gilbert.

300
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:48,610
Not you, Dean!

301
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:53,552
The defeat can be a
victory, only...

302
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,189
Only...?

303
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,370
"Franklin is not here."
I noticed. Where is he?

304
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,186
In the next room with an
ambassador who came from America.

305
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,397
Only I'm afraid, M. De La Fayette,

306
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:06,420
that in that message -

307
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,057
"Everything is over!"

308
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,923
<i>It's over!</i>

309
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:18,067
Gentlemen!

310
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:22,155
Congress of Boston

311
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:26,555
proclaimed the independence
of the American colonies!

312
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,787
Long live the Congress!

313
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:31,195
Mr. Franklin,

314
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:34,720
independence does not
proclaim, it is conquered!

315
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:36,868
It's true, Mr. Kalb.

316
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:39,516
But they do not lose it either.

317
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:41,341
In one single battle!

318
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,427
Lose! If she's the last!

319
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:46,430
The last battle will be the one
where the British will be defeated!

320
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:49,652
"You, Mr. Marquis?"
Me! And you, General Kalb!

321
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:51,644
All of you who will go with me!

322
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:54,626
- On the air balloon?
- On the ship! On my!

323
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,869
"Can you get the ship?"
"Ships are bought."

324
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:02,728
"They cost more than conscience," monsieur.

325
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:07,410
You are rich, but is the price
of the ship known to you?

326
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:09,756
Load with weapons? A?

327
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:12,227
Freedom of price does not matter, monsieur!

328
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:15,449
But now it is freedom

329
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:20,486
you run the risk if the king finds
out that you want to buy a ship!

330
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:22,863
When he finds out, I'll be
on the high seas already.

331
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,688
One moment!

332
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:28,213
Are you serious,
Monsieur de La Fayette?

333
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:31,685
Can you find 100-120
thousand livres?

334
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:33,395
And even 2 times more!

335
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,158
I do not want to offend anyone,

336
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:39,787
but we all sail with a contract in your
pocket and epaulettes on your shoulders.

337
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:42,623
But you - you do not ask for anything,

338
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,969
but offer a ship and weapons?

339
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:48,223
"But on one condition."
Ah, all the same! What?

340
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,486
That this ship was
called "Victory".

341
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,571
Bravo, Gilbert! Bravo!

342
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:58,264
"And in the evening he goes to her."
"Are you sure about that?"

343
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:01,330
Is he a secretive person?
No, that's it!

344
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:05,147
He himself confessed: "I rush
to ideas, flags, women"...

345
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:08,807
So what? 2 chances out
of 3 that you are wrong.

346
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:13,270
But I love him.

347
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,754
And if only he loved you?

348
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:21,320
If he did not like ideas, flags,

349
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:23,582
if women did not love him?

350
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,407
Would you love him?

351
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,618
I think yes.

352
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:32,081
For me, love is so simple...
For him, too! And even too much!

353
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,343
He needs fame.

354
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:38,483
And this woman can make you
suffer more than others.

355
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,441
You are not asleep?

356
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,409
Do not touch me, Gilbert!

357
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:09,015
Adrienne...

358
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:12,414
How could I embrace you if I had
been in the arms of another before?

359
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:14,833
Answer!

360
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:18,796
I'm sure that Countess
de Simian likes you!

361
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:22,456
Yes, I like it. I do not deny.

362
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,864
I also like Aglaya.

363
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:28,535
Only they both have what
plays against them.

364
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,600
What?

365
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,518
You!

366
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:37,148
My soul!

367
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:40,944
But then where do you go in the
evenings under the cover of secrecy?

368
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:44,176
To one old gentleman -

369
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:46,355
To Benjamin Franklin.

370
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,118
Why are you hiding this from me?

371
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:51,955
"Because you're a little girl."
I'm a spouse and mother!

372
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,623
Yes, and it is also!

373
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,252
A little girl, wife, mother.
Is this not enough?

374
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:00,380
Is it worth it to load these
charming little hangers?

375
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:07,148
If I was sure of your love, you
could do whatever you want!

376
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,650
Even leave?

377
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,350
To leave?

378
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,936
Not sure if I'll be back?

379
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,752
To the rebels!

380
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:19,181
So?

381
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,163
Yes, my soul, so.

382
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,638
And that is not all.

383
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:30,682
You do not need to stop me:

384
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:33,248
You heard the king.

385
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:36,762
They are following us openly.
Especially for me.

386
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:40,630
And you are close to the most
severe of my supervisors.

387
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,310
- Who is it?
- Your father.

388
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:49,452
Shikua! "Yes, Mr. Duke?"

389
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,033
Where did Mr. de La Fayette come from?

390
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:52,903
You can choose.

391
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,854
To be with him against
me, to keep me.

392
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:59,963
Or with me against
him, to lose me.

393
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:04,405
See what I'm asking my girl?

394
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:07,387
Just like the heroine Corneille.

395
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:24,989
What, including this bill, is
the sum of 112 thousand livres.

396
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:26,897
And 29 days of waiting.

397
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:31,130
Körgret, Mr. Marquis, was one
of your most beautiful estates.

398
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:33,039
I was not going to sacrifice them.

399
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:37,032
It was necessary to play in competition.

400
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,338
I would prefer to sell 2
estates, but wait 2 times less.

401
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:46,678
Mr. Marquis, you did not deem it necessary
to entrust the old notary and family friend,

402
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:49,451
what are you going to
do with this money.

403
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:54,790
Yes, it's a fortune, but
the one who gets it,

404
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,928
can and wait.

405
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:00,536
There are cases, monsieur, when
to force to wait is a crime.

406
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:10,484
"Well, dear master?"
"He raised the sum."

407
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:13,257
But I still do not know what
he's going to do with her.

408
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:16,062
- Only a mysterious phrase.
- What?

409
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:19,482
What to force to wait.
Sometimes it's a crime.

410
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:31,370
I will not be until
the evening, my soul.

411
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:33,789
This melody will accompany me.

412
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,198
Together with the one who plays it.

413
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,909
"Have you collected the full amount?"
Yes.

414
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,969
Until evening, Mother.

415
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,682
"Is it gold there?"
"Forget it, forget it."

416
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,996
Here I am stupid!

417
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:57,438
When the husband leaves his wife with pockets
full of gold, then he goes for gifts.

418
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,858
That's right, mother,
I'm going to get gifts.

419
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:10,931
"Sit down, Gilbert."
"I have a meeting, Father."

420
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:14,185
I know. I'll take you there.

421
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,209
I ask you to.

422
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:28,585
My dear Mr. Dean, I am
only a peasant son,

423
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:30,452
like your mischief from Missouri.

424
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,433
But I knew many noblemen.

425
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:36,312
A glass on the chest - and they are
ready to go broke for a noble purpose.

426
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:38,856
Sober they too are ruined,
but for the sake of women.

427
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:41,442
"But not La Fayette, Mr. Kalb."
"That's what I thought."

428
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,529
But look - he pulls a week,
and this is the limit.

429
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:48,116
If today I do not leave for Bordeaux,
I will not make it there by Monday.

430
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:50,931
And on Monday everything will be over -
there will be no more ship.

431
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:52,954
He said - at 4 o'clock.

432
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:54,351
The latest.

433
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,207
And now - without 15 four.

434
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,126
112 thousand livres that you have here...

435
00:27:58,314 --> 00:27:59,961
You are well informed.

436
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:03,048
Then you probably know who
this gold is intended for?

437
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:05,321
Yes. "Countess de Simian?"

438
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:07,907
No. The rebels.

439
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:12,684
Only one woman could
inform you so well.

440
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,138
You have your secrets, I have mine.

441
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:15,828
"But if it's Adrienne..."
"What is Adrienne?"

442
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:17,688
She is my wife!
"She's my daughter!"

443
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:22,464
This is your state, you want.
Give it to the rebels,

444
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:25,175
but give it away secretly
and do nothing else.

445
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,511
Your sword belongs to the king.

446
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:31,285
"One day, he may be happy."
"But while he is careful."

447
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:35,556
Do you think you are leaving Noahle for America's sake?
But, it may be that for the sake of the Bastille!

448
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,813
"She does not frighten me."
And me yes.

449
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:41,337
For my daughter's husband, I wish
for a better fate than a prison.

450
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:45,300
So, before we go to your meeting,
we will first go to another one.

451
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,094
Let's try to put the king's
suspicions to sleep.

452
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,034
Are you taking me to the king?

453
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:52,463
"No, to his brother."
- To whom?

454
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:54,559
To the eldest.

455
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:58,126
Let in Mr. de La Fayette.

456
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:00,003
Give me this.

457
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:02,255
And then your clothes are deformed.

458
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,195
I do not confiscate it,
but I am depositing it.

459
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:10,263
Thank you.

460
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:16,082
Welcome, Monsieur de La Fayette

461
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:18,355
under this roof, which
will become yours!

462
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:19,314
Mine?

463
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:22,672
My First Junk Camera
lives in my house.

464
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:26,801
But, it seems, for you it is news?

465
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,554
Yes, forgive me, monsignor.

466
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,037
Mr. D'Aién probably
wanted to surprise me.

467
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:35,268
As I see, he succeeded.

468
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:37,750
But he should consult me!

469
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,931
Yes, this title is a high honor, monsignor,
and I feel that it is not worthy.

470
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:45,133
Your name, your uniform,
your condition -

471
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:47,760
make you just very even worthy!

472
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,533
Thank you, monsieur.

473
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,329
But in addition to these
merits, which you listed,

474
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,498
I have weaknesses that
I cherish even more:

475
00:29:56,853 --> 00:29:58,063
My ideas!

476
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,607
Oh, yes... I forgot.

477
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,402
To have ideas today is
considered a good form.

478
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:05,591
What's an idea!

479
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:08,219
As if the origin of
this does not save!

480
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:12,338
Youth, name, fortune and wife -

481
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,058
this is not enough for you?

482
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:18,751
Leave ideas to those
who need them to live!

483
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,961
They also need me to live.

484
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,109
And my ideas prevent
me from serving you.

485
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,904
I would like, monsieur, to
judge this you left to me.

486
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:28,094
"They're built on one word, monsieur."
Which?

487
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:30,784
- Freedom!
- Oh yeah! Only a word!

488
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:33,787
"But it raises the world!"
"Only a part, the most modest."

489
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:35,435
The youngest!

490
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:37,145
Monsieur de La Fayette!

491
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:41,170
Your honesty is another
virtue to be in my court.

492
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:47,530
Your father-in-law did not hide from me
your sympathy for the colonists of America,

493
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:50,575
but treat these
filibusters as...

494
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,973
how women treat their hair!

495
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:56,310
Do not build your life in fashion,

496
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:59,230
because in France everything
comes out of fashion.

497
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:00,982
And nothing changes.

498
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:04,611
Everything will change, I hope!
Otherwise, France should be sorry if...

499
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:07,134
And the king? How is the king, monsieur?

500
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,397
And the people, monsignor?
What about the people?

501
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,780
The people will be only
happy if several hot goals

502
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:13,453
will stop grinding tongue!

503
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:16,039
These people do not speak language!
They're fighting!

504
00:31:16,102 --> 00:31:18,875
Against dishonesty of ministers,
against corruption of judges,

505
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,128
for reducing the slavery
of this "happy" people!

506
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:24,548
This is a program of
revolution, monsieur!?

507
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:28,719
And you will understand, monsieur, that a
revolutionary can not be the First Junker Chamber...

508
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:31,576
I'm not a king, but
someday I can become one!

509
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:32,765
Yes!

510
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:37,937
And from now on I believe that a revolutionary is
dangerous not only for France, but also for my home!

511
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:40,001
I warned you, monsieur!

512
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:48,239
Monsignor awaits the Duke of Aiens.

513
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:50,700
Well, what did you tell him?

514
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:52,848
You will learn from his own lips.

515
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:56,372
Oh, your clothes are
completely deformed.

516
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:58,145
Oh, I'm sorry!

517
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:13,181
I had just been appointed First Cavalry
Officer of the King's brother.

518
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,186
I need you for an urgent
and secret mission!

519
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:24,068
In Bordeaux! Everything is over!

520
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:25,611
And here he is!

521
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,703
Between two gendarmes?

522
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,520
Thank you, gentlemen!
I do not need you anymore!

523
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,840
You are cool, Monsieur de La Fayette!

524
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,346
Bye!

525
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:54,120
And soon come back!

526
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:08,697
The first mission of your son-in-law
is successfully completed.

527
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:09,698
Sorry?

528
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:13,552
The King's brother entrusted him the delivery of a large
sum of gold, and I had the honor of escorting him.

529
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:18,124
Honor?! This honor can
lead you to the Bastille!

530
00:33:37,206 --> 00:33:38,895
I already despaired...

531
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:45,464
Well?

532
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,927
It was the Countess
de Simian, Herr Duke.

533
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:52,054
Again...

534
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,622
A scene from Marivo, dear.
"Is it my fault?"

535
00:33:56,726 --> 00:34:01,168
My father-in-law began to worry if I throw rebels
for the sake of your beautiful eyes, the countess.

536
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:06,194
God grant. At least my beautiful eyes
will not bring you to the Bastille.

537
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:09,781
Gilbert, we're going to the queen.
In honor of what is it?

538
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,597
Your comedy can not
deceive anyone.

539
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:15,641
With all the inconveniences
of your mistress's situation,

540
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,644
I also have privileges.

541
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:22,857
One merciful soul, in secret
from Morp, warned me.

542
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,004
About what?

543
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,289
M. De La Fayette.

544
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:46,319
We first see you at a concert
of chamber music, monsieur?

545
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:47,445
It is so, Your Majesty.

546
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:51,720
Or maybe you just want to meet
here with dear Mr. Lozan?

547
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,671
Or with the sweet Maurois?

548
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:59,895
Or with this glorious Segur,
whom I also rarely see?

549
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,941
No, M. De La Fayette came
to see your Majesty,

550
00:35:04,046 --> 00:35:05,589
on my advice.

551
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:09,551
You turn my salon into
a place of conspiracy!

552
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:11,866
But it's so entertaining.

553
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,120
And people who amuse me are
worthy of my condescension.

554
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:16,830
I am embarrassed...

555
00:35:17,122 --> 00:35:19,207
But your Majesty knows
my sincerity...

556
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:21,126
And I know your
problems, monsieur.

557
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:25,359
And I'm betting that you came to
listen to my music to talk about them.

558
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:27,038
Yes, Your Majesty!

559
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:30,531
God, what a funny man he is!

560
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:32,283
Nothing will escape
from Your Majesty!

561
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:34,452
Oh, no... Alas!

562
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:37,413
Gentlemen! King!

563
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,561
Sire, let me...

564
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:43,274
What you need?

565
00:35:43,336 --> 00:35:44,838
Your signature, sir.

566
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,279
I'm going to the queen.
Your signature will wait until tomorrow!

567
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:49,989
You persevere!

568
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:52,325
Sire, persistence -
the main duty of the Minister.

569
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:53,393
But not before 9 am!

570
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,788
Speak. But fast.
I adore this arietta.

571
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,979
I'm afraid it's too late, Your Majesty.

572
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,878
Morpas chases me even
from you, madam.

573
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:07,319
You are my last refuge
from this annoying person.

574
00:36:07,486 --> 00:36:09,238
Last thing.

575
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:13,034
Sign? I decided
that at such a time

576
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:16,641
I want to make only
one decision: Sleep!

577
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:19,811
So use this immoderate
love to sleep!

578
00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:23,190
What are you doing?
"Quiet, please do not be afraid!"

579
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:30,322
I'm afraid, sir, that these
signatures are urgent.

580
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:33,972
Listen, my friend!
So I take refuge or study?

581
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:37,580
You are right, madam.
Start the music.

582
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:39,832
Get it over with, monsieur.

583
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,425
You look puzzled, Louis.

584
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,199
Is from what.
These are warrants for arrest.

585
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:54,305
You look at the surname!

586
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,385
How, monsieur! Arrest the nobles
who came to me as friends?

587
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:05,171
They just came to your Majesty,
because they must be arrested.

588
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:08,987
I take you as a witness, sir:
Your Minister accuses me of conspiracy!

589
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:10,739
Watch the words, Morp!

590
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:13,763
Take your files.
Queen is right, this is not the right time.

591
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:18,935
Your Majesty will not reproach me, if I
soon bring you a new decree for signature?

592
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,156
"What Decree?"
- About war.

593
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:25,838
About war...
"England is losing patience."

594
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,883
And the departure to America of Mr.
La Fayette and his friends

595
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:31,677
will be the last straw...
England...

596
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:34,722
You should let me
listen to the music.

597
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:41,563
I'm sorry, madam, but the friendship of England
demands that we choose our friends well.

598
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,419
Wait, Sire!

599
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:45,421
Interested persons are all here!

600
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:49,258
Unless of elementary politeness
should not they be informed?

601
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:52,595
I'm in your quarters,
madam, I obey.

602
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:57,266
Gentlemen!

603
00:37:57,433 --> 00:38:00,686
The Queen disgusts that we decide
your fate behind your back.

604
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:04,524
I note that you yourself decide
the fate of France for mine.

605
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:08,153
So, to make it pleasant,
I will inform you,

606
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:11,427
that I sign the arrest
of all four of you.

607
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,931
And now - music.

608
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:17,214
Sire, I was just thinking...

609
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:21,176
Is there no more... elegant
way to appease England,

610
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:23,773
than to imprison Mr. de La Fayette?
What kind?

611
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:25,692
Yes, send it to them!

612
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,131
A delightful idea!

613
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:31,155
Monsieur de La Fayette is not an
ambassador, but in London his uncle Noail.

614
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:35,014
Relatives call each other to visit,
especially if the king advises.

615
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:39,998
Oh, madam, why do I need two ministers,
if you are alone, stand ten?

616
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,337
You will go to London, monsieur.

617
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,548
Moreover, it's time
for me to go to bed.

618
00:38:49,946 --> 00:38:51,990
"Your Majesty..."
"That's enough, Morpah!"

619
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:54,304
You saw, it's already 10 pm!
This is madness!

620
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:57,829
If they will not let me
sleep, where France will go!

621
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:02,813
How can I thank Your Majesty?

622
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,191
Having turned heads to English women.

623
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,381
"Be patient, though..."
I do not like to endure.

624
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:10,801
Good luck in London!

625
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,021
My dear Noail, at the risk of
shocking our glorious Germein,

626
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:26,817
I repeat to you: We should not
have taken Canada away from you.

627
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,738
You forget, Your Grace, that
England lives by trade.

628
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:34,262
And what does this trade live?
His colonies.

629
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:37,870
But if you take away from
friends their colonies,

630
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,707
one fine morning you can wake up

631
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,024
without trade, without colonies...
and without friends!

632
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:48,517
What a pity for France, that on
the throne you were not seated,

633
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:51,322
but your brother.
I like everything in France:

634
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:53,657
Her ideas, her spirit

635
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,409
and her wine!

636
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,307
What shall we drink, gentlemen?

637
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:58,725
But...

638
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:01,238
for France, of course!

639
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,543
"For England!"
- For both!

640
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:06,296
Ah, you are very timely,
my dear d'Aijen!

641
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:07,943
Your Highness.

642
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:10,581
France - the subject of our gossip.

643
00:40:11,134 --> 00:40:13,762
But did not you promise to bring Mr.
De La Fayette?

644
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,910
He's here, Your Grace.

645
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:18,016
Oh, excuse me, monsieur.

646
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,187
I've heard a lot about you, but I
did not expect you to be so young!

647
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:23,647
I also!

648
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:26,254
Your youth makes
you even prettier.

649
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:27,922
And less dangerous.

650
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:33,052
Will you raise this glass with us?
For the alliance?

651
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:36,900
"What alliance?"
"Our two countries!"

652
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:41,102
With pleasure, Your Grace, but when
there will not be a third between us.

653
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:42,625
Which one?

654
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,314
America.

655
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:48,923
America, monsieur, is not a country.
This is an English colony.

656
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,634
Lord Germaine, the Minister of Colonies.

657
00:40:51,738 --> 00:40:52,990
Monsieur.

658
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:57,015
I've heard a lot about you, Mr.
De La Fayette.

659
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:01,081
Did you want to cross the Atlantic?
And crossed only the English Channel.

660
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:04,147
I thought you understood
who the winner is?

661
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:07,588
The ministries are always in a hurry
to declare victory, Your Excellency.

662
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:09,934
The rebels did not
surrender, as far as I know?

663
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:13,938
Gold, which is distributed by Mr.
Sales Dean and Franklin in Paris,

664
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:16,451
not for a long time delay this fact.

665
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:20,205
Not gold calls for the action of
friends of freedom, Your Excellency.

666
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:23,204
What can not you say about the German
mercenaries fighting for you...

667
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:26,795
It's better than the bandits from the
big road, who are recruited in France!

668
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,215
If the French volunteers -
just a rabble,

669
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:31,175
How could they stop
the British army?

670
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:33,751
You forget who you are visiting!

671
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,200
No, no, leave it.

672
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:37,306
I also like French fervor.

673
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,142
Major General Cornwallis.

674
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:41,290
- And here is our guest of honor!
- Yes.

675
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:45,315
Mr. de La Fayette, you will
receive the latest news

676
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,296
about your rebel friends.

677
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,725
Gentlemen, I have the honor and
pleasure to present to you.

678
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:59,037
Major-General Cornwallis, who
has just returned from America.

679
00:41:59,074 --> 00:42:00,455
Sir! Sir!

680
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,825
Are you French, monsieur?

681
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,934
Forgive me, but my English ears
have not heard your name well.

682
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,852
The Marquis de La Fayette.

683
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,773
Do you like hunting?

684
00:42:25,856 --> 00:42:28,442
So much so that I keep
souvenirs about her.

685
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:31,487
I spent all my childhood in Auvergne.
They hunt a lot.

686
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,013
A! As in the west of England,
in the Duchy of Cornwall.

687
00:42:36,117 --> 00:42:38,849
I hope to return there
when the war is over.

688
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:41,289
Is it not said in London
that it is coming to an end?

689
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:43,312
In London? Maybe.

690
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,254
Do you think the
insurgents will last long?

691
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,195
While they have a leader
like Washington, yes.

692
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,344
And his army, monsieur?

693
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:57,577
Does it deserve the
honor of Lord Zhermeyn?

694
00:42:57,723 --> 00:43:01,268
You are young, monsieur, but
you are a military man.

695
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:04,855
Gang partisan with bare feet,

696
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:08,150
armed with hunting rifles
and without officers,

697
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,653
deterrent to the onslaught
of the British army

698
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:13,635
does not deserve anything
other than contempt?

699
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,116
Oh yeah.

700
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,951
Victory!

701
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,288
Monsieur de La Fayette,

702
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:25,314
I heard that the rebels have
many friends in France.

703
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,961
Are you one of them?

704
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,589
You are a military man, monsieur.

705
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:31,909
I'm sure you do not
need to explain.

706
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:37,118
For a young man and a spiritual, is there a
better reason for fighting than freedom?!

707
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:40,392
If I understood you correctly,
but I think I understood...

708
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:44,333
next time we will meet
with a weapon in hand...

709
00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:46,085
just like now.

710
00:43:46,836 --> 00:43:50,611
Perhaps on different sides
of the battlefield.

711
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,988
I'm afraid you're right.

712
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:54,615
Certainly!

713
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:57,451
Attention!

714
00:43:57,555 --> 00:43:59,849
"Your bird, sir!"
"No, it's yours!"

715
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:07,837
Sorry, you just messed her up.

716
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:15,386
In any case, I will
remember your frankness.

717
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:17,284
With pleasure.

718
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:20,246
And I - your courtesy.

719
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:51,966
I'm from Kalba.

720
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:15,907
Mister Bancroft!

721
00:45:16,262 --> 00:45:18,139
At your service, monsieur.

722
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:21,267
"Are you staying in London?"
Till.

723
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:23,206
Can I trust you with one errand?

724
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,375
You see that yes.

725
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:29,943
I will give you a letter for my
father-in-law of the Duke of Aiens.

726
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:32,549
But you will give it
to him only in a week.

727
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:39,306
"Mr. Bancroft?"
- Right.

728
00:45:39,724 --> 00:45:42,789
They say you have a letter
from my son-in-law for me?

729
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:44,687
Right.

730
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,084
Why did not he give it to him?

731
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:50,568
When we write to someone, it means
we do not want to meet with him.

732
00:45:59,494 --> 00:46:01,517
I suppose you know everything?

733
00:46:01,934 --> 00:46:04,165
Not true. Nothing.

734
00:46:04,493 --> 00:46:07,106
But you serve as a messenger
of my son-in-law?

735
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:10,297
I like to provide services.

736
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:12,497
This is a farewell letter.

737
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:14,885
This is what you knew?

738
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:16,491
Right.

739
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,160
But it's not my business.

740
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:22,643
There is one thing that you
may be able to explain to me.

741
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:23,978
Maybe.

742
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:25,750
My brother-in-law writes to me:

743
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:29,275
<i>"When you receive this letter, it
will take a week from my departure."</i>

744
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:30,338
Yes.

745
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:32,737
But my son-in-law left
London only yesterday!

746
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,988
Yes.

747
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:36,574
He did not ask you
to wait this week?

748
00:46:37,554 --> 00:46:39,848
Right. "Why did not you do it?"

749
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:44,749
I already told you -
I like to provide services.

750
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:47,565
You are such a curious character, Mr.
Bancroft!

751
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:48,712
Right.

752
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:51,631
I know how interested you are in Mr.
La Fayette.

753
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:54,113
Why make you wait a whole week,

754
00:46:54,238 --> 00:46:57,502
to find out all the
details of his journey?

755
00:46:57,596 --> 00:47:00,453
What details?
"Did not he tell you?"

756
00:47:00,557 --> 00:47:04,978
Usually travelers in farewell
letters give some details?

757
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:08,565
For example?
"Oh... I know so little."

758
00:47:08,628 --> 00:47:12,309
I only know that your son-in-law must
meet in Paris with a certain Baron Kalb,

759
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,969
with whom he will rise in Bordeaux
aboard the ship "Victory",

760
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:18,054
immediately sailing to America,

761
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:21,391
where Mr. La Fayette will fight
in the ranks of the rebels

762
00:47:21,454 --> 00:47:23,894
in the rank of general
of the American army.

763
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:27,522
As you can see, I do not know
much, let's just say - nothing!

764
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:29,958
It was necessary to give
me this letter right away!

765
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:31,485
Well no!

766
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,093
A week later.

767
00:47:35,176 --> 00:47:39,076
"It's either too early or too late."
No, if you urgently send a person,

768
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,643
he will make it to Paris in time.
Believe me, I figured it all out.

769
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,083
You are playing a strange game, monsieur!

770
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,460
Right.

771
00:47:47,585 --> 00:47:49,879
I lead even 2 games. As you can see.

772
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:52,256
- Counting on a double win!
- That's not true.

773
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:54,217
To win for sure.

774
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:57,136
And how much do I owe you?

775
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,858
Wait for the win, Mr. Duke.

776
00:48:00,014 --> 00:48:01,579
Soon!

777
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:47,506
- Stop!
- Miss it!

778
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:50,191
Courier from London for
royal intelligence!

779
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:15,989
Is this a good time
to bother people?

780
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:17,407
Give here an envelope.

781
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:31,839
Let the messenger be
sent to me immediately.

782
00:49:32,652 --> 00:49:34,007
Adrienne...

783
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:39,972
Now listen to me.

784
00:49:41,682 --> 00:49:43,434
I did not return.

785
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:45,728
I'd like to check out.

786
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,650
Yes, my soul.

787
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,028
"When?"
- Now.

788
00:49:57,219 --> 00:49:59,065
No choice.

789
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:01,578
I would cease to respect myself.

790
00:50:02,057 --> 00:50:03,601
You too.

791
00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:08,647
I'll be waiting for you!
"My little girl..."

792
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:13,840
You will be mocked.

793
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,503
You will also have your own war.

794
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:23,871
Against the father, against
the king, against all...

795
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:28,710
It is much harder to fight against
friends than against enemies.

796
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:35,029
You, too, must know one thing...

797
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,074
- Yes?
- Dad...

798
00:50:38,407 --> 00:50:40,931
It was not I who told him.

799
00:50:41,807 --> 00:50:44,184
You suspected me, I know.

800
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:46,655
But I did not say anything to him.

801
00:50:48,856 --> 00:50:51,567
Always call me your girl.

802
00:50:51,984 --> 00:50:54,048
But when you are there...

803
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:57,928
remember that you
have a real wife!

804
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:16,384
Run!

805
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:18,011
Faster!

806
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:21,452
I'll detain them.

807
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,717
What's wrong, monsieur?

808
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,180
Madame, by order of the King, we must make sure
of the identity of the Marquis de La Fayette.

809
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:41,973
But the Marquis in London!

810
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:43,725
Upstairs it should know.

811
00:51:43,808 --> 00:51:45,935
The order of the king
is categorical, madam.

812
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,585
Let us verify that Mr. de La
Fayette is not here for sure.

813
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:51,671
Show me this order.

814
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,163
Perform your duties, monsieur.

815
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,343
Well, did you find him?

816
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:21,305
You should be better,
madam, if I could find it!

817
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:34,402
Ugh, barely escaped!
To me the bloodhounds of Morp!

818
00:52:34,439 --> 00:52:35,862
We immediately leave!

819
00:52:35,904 --> 00:52:39,111
You do not know, Gilbert, but Morpas woke
the king in the middle of the night!

820
00:52:39,136 --> 00:52:40,513
Heck! What did he say to him?

821
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,016
I warn you, everything will be
done to prevent your departure.

822
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,666
Dear Dean, I never thought that
it would be a pleasure trip.

823
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:51,378
And what do you say when your king
will consider you a deserter?

824
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:55,153
The deserters are the losers.
And I'm going to win!

825
00:52:55,716 --> 00:52:57,801
Monsieur de La Fayette,

826
00:52:58,052 --> 00:52:59,595
listen to me.

827
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:04,715
You must understand what I should
give you this advice, but...

828
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,978
stay!

829
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:10,502
Mr. Franklin, I'm sorry,
but I can not follow.

830
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:13,255
What should I say to
General Washington?

831
00:53:13,797 --> 00:53:16,654
What do you think of all of France.

832
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:30,043
We go! I already did not believe it.
"You will be a general, Baron!"

833
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,879
"A funny team, Mr. Marquis."
What?

834
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:37,196
These horses, we are with you...
I'm German, you're French.

835
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,618
But I cultivate prudence, and you...
how can I say...

836
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,891
fanatic!

837
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:45,622
A fake baron, a real marquis.

838
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:49,434
A former poor man who will become a rich man
and a rich man by birth who may become poor.

839
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,628
But under the American flag!

840
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,443
You will see, we have a common.
What?

841
00:53:54,527 --> 00:53:55,945
We are free!

842
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:14,506
Your mascot?

843
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:17,008
Yes, my talisman.

844
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:20,575
And this is yours?

845
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,920
Yes, it's mine.

846
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:36,237
Dragoons are catching up! Faster!

847
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:05,996
Faster Faster! We will be caught up!

848
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:14,026
Take the horses off the route!
Quickly!

849
00:55:52,461 --> 00:55:53,817
Where are they?

850
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:57,174
I advise you to tell everything!

851
00:55:57,258 --> 00:55:59,677
Where are the ones you drove?
I do not understand anything!

852
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:31,689
We are heading towards the Antilles.
I said "aside"...

853
00:56:32,169 --> 00:56:35,276
Why are they laughing?
We are not sailing to the Antilles?

854
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:37,987
Captain Loco Barsolino.

855
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:39,531
Hello Captain!

856
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:43,556
You see, the Antilles -
it was for Commander Bordeaux.

857
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:46,997
And you will go to America.
In America? As to America?!

858
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,770
With a stop in the Antilles?
No, without any stops.

859
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:52,127
"And my cargo?" "What load?"

860
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,234
A little cloth, a bit of
junk to sell on the islands.

861
00:56:55,297 --> 00:56:57,674
It was not stipulated in
our contract, Captain!

862
00:56:57,716 --> 00:57:00,010
America was not there too!

863
00:57:00,094 --> 00:57:04,098
Captain, you can sell
your goods in America.

864
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,097
If it is seen by the British, they
will not buy, but will be taken away.

865
00:57:07,122 --> 00:57:08,675
He's right.

866
00:57:09,729 --> 00:57:12,043
Then I'll buy it.

867
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:13,816
"The whole?"
- That's all.

868
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:17,111
What will you do with all this cloth?
You know how many of them!

869
00:57:17,174 --> 00:57:20,177
But not enough to dress
the entire rebel army.

870
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:23,055
Come on, captain, get off
the anchor immediately.

871
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:26,079
"Immediately?
And your luggage, Mr. Marquis?"

872
00:57:26,162 --> 00:57:28,456
My luggage?
We will not wait for him.

873
00:57:28,623 --> 00:57:30,917
Yes, but I have to wait for something.

874
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:33,315
- What?
- The tide!

875
00:57:33,399 --> 00:57:35,088
2 hours more.

876
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,237
2 hours?
But in 2 hours there will be dragoons!

877
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:42,304
What can you do? The tide can not
be here before, mister marquis!

878
00:57:42,366 --> 00:57:43,367
Impossible!

879
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:46,788
Pray, Marquis.
And I believe only in the devil!

880
00:57:49,895 --> 00:57:51,918
And I'm in Madonna.

881
00:57:51,981 --> 00:57:56,298
The Madonna heard you, Mr. Marquis.
The calm begins.

882
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:06,443
Stop!

883
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:11,250
It's late, Captain.

884
00:58:13,273 --> 00:58:15,296
<i>Damn it!</i>

885
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,965
Do not be afraid, Baron.

886
00:58:31,897 --> 00:58:35,015
If I am found on board,
Victory is confiscated

887
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:37,569
together with all weapons and provisions.

888
00:58:37,653 --> 00:58:39,947
"Yes, like Sussex."
- No!

889
00:58:40,072 --> 00:58:42,366
"Victory" must swim!

890
00:58:42,637 --> 00:58:45,682
Captain! Comes calm,
and you sail away!

891
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:47,455
Without me.

892
00:58:47,517 --> 00:58:49,932
- But this is impossible...
- No, without you we will not sail!

893
00:58:49,957 --> 00:58:52,773
Swim! This is my first order!

894
00:58:53,607 --> 00:58:55,087
And last.

895
00:58:56,902 --> 00:58:59,342
Change me there as best you can.

896
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:08,226
Your talisman turned
out better, Baron.

897
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:34,253
It was necessary for you
to run, mister marquis!

898
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:36,338
But, finally, I caught up with you.

899
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:38,862
I had a message for you.

900
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:40,989
Message from the King.

901
00:59:41,114 --> 00:59:43,804
That's how then do not
believe in the devil?

902
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:47,120
I will make your route
myself up to Marseilles.

903
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,813
Do not be offended by the precautions
that we are forced to take against you.

904
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,776
Remember, on the contrary, we will not do
anything about the team and the cargo.

905
00:59:57,006 --> 01:00:00,217
As you can see, you are not
under arrest, Mr. Marquis.

906
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:02,490
Your carriage is waiting for you.

907
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,099
He was not arrested.

908
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:09,519
No. But he is put in a carriage.

909
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,366
Wait! By the order of the king!

910
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,223
Tell me, please, who are you,
monsieur, and where are you going?

911
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:49,622
Marquis de La Fayette, I go to
Marseilles by the order of the King.

912
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,703
Is that what you wanted to know?
All right, monsieur.

913
01:01:51,728 --> 01:01:54,481
Sorry for the precautions...
Let's hit the road!

914
01:02:06,911 --> 01:02:09,476
Cut off the road! Stop it!

915
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:25,002
Maurois!

916
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,161
You did not leave? Without
you I will not go!

917
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,663
But nothing hindered you!
You were free.

918
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:32,479
I did not come to accompany you, Gilbert.
I came for you.

919
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:35,461
To return to the "Victory."
Swim?

920
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:39,194
Listen, without us, our
departure does not make sense.

921
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,364
So I offered to drop anchor
in Spain, in Los Pasajes.

922
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:44,992
Everyone agreed, I jumped
into the first boat and...

923
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:49,059
And you want me to hug you tight
and follow you to Pacheases?

924
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:51,749
On, read it.

925
01:02:54,564 --> 01:02:57,046
The king orders me
to go to Marseilles,

926
01:02:57,192 --> 01:02:58,673
and I'm going.

927
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:02,281
But I order you
to go to America!

928
01:03:02,406 --> 01:03:05,847
Fight 2 times more and win!

929
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,787
Leave, Maurois! Leave!

930
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:13,302
"Farewell, Gilbert!"
- Goodbye!

931
01:03:17,275 --> 01:03:18,766
Maurois!

932
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:38,651
It is he!

933
01:03:38,797 --> 01:03:41,571
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am sure! It is he!

934
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,344
Boat! Faster!

935
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:05,554
Prepare to sail!

936
01:04:10,664 --> 01:04:13,020
Sailors starboard - ready!

937
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:15,627
Give up the moorings!

938
01:04:17,963 --> 01:04:20,924
Lift the jib and the mizzen!

939
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,291
Congratulations, Morpah!

940
01:04:23,343 --> 01:04:25,679
Just in vain, day and night
watching for Mr. La Fayette.

941
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:28,140
If Your Majesty
listened to me...

942
01:04:28,453 --> 01:04:29,996
Why are you laughing, madam?

943
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,978
Agree that he beautifully
guided you around your finger!

944
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,086
I do not know if it will be
considered beautiful England!

945
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:40,799
What is the temperature in the
English Embassy, Vergeon?

946
01:04:41,154 --> 01:04:43,030
Frosty, sir.

947
01:04:43,135 --> 01:04:45,908
This proves, Sir, that
England does not consider

948
01:04:45,971 --> 01:04:49,975
the help of La Fayette to the
rebels is so insignificant.

949
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,828
Do not you think, madam, that a
young man who does not have 20,

950
01:04:52,853 --> 01:04:54,855
will change the course
of history in America?

951
01:04:54,897 --> 01:04:56,461
How to know!

952
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:59,126
Monsieur de La Fayette disobeyed
me, and you are having fun, madam!

953
01:04:59,151 --> 01:05:02,676
No! But if he, on the
high seas, heard you...

954
01:05:02,718 --> 01:05:04,657
he would surely be cheerful!

955
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:22,008
Looking for English frigates, Mr.
Marquis?

956
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:24,845
Your assistant thinks that
we can meet them here.

957
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:30,100
We can not even meet a miracle.
But I do not really believe in a miracle.

958
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:33,979
Have you ever been inspected at sea?
No never.

959
01:05:34,188 --> 01:05:37,441
The frigate raises a red
flag, and you are white.

960
01:05:37,545 --> 01:05:39,255
Never!

961
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:43,134
On the 1 st demand,
you quickly raise it.

962
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:44,615
Never!

963
01:05:45,053 --> 01:05:47,722
On the 2nd requirement,
if "No way!" - "Fire!"

964
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:50,725
Do you know how many cannons
are in small English frigates?

965
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:52,561
- 12!
- And we have 2.

966
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:54,375
So no sea fights!

967
01:05:54,459 --> 01:05:57,211
Well, that's nice.
You are sensible, Mr. Marquis.

968
01:05:57,649 --> 01:06:00,465
You will go to the
frigate full sails.

969
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:03,989
Abortage and attack on swords!

970
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:10,141
We in the sea trade
often transport swords.

971
01:06:10,558 --> 01:06:13,624
But we do not touch them.
I'll give you lessons.

972
01:06:13,812 --> 01:06:16,419
I sold you my ship, Mr. Marquis,

973
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:19,881
but not your own skin!

974
01:06:24,198 --> 01:06:25,908
On swords... Aha!

975
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:32,081
At the same English frigate on the horizon,
untie the boat from the port side!

976
01:06:32,227 --> 01:06:34,813
We calmly go to the sea!

977
01:06:35,522 --> 01:06:38,379
Count to 20 and then - bang!

978
01:06:40,861 --> 01:06:43,613
For the ship has already been paid.

979
01:06:47,034 --> 01:06:49,933
<i>"Being a defender of
freedom, which I worship,"</i>

980
01:06:50,037 --> 01:06:52,519
<i>being himself free
more than anyone else,</i>

981
01:06:52,581 --> 01:06:56,439
<i>in a friendly manner, offering its
services to this so interesting republic,</i>

982
01:06:56,564 --> 01:07:01,069
<i>I offer her only my
sincerity and my good will.</i>

983
01:07:08,702 --> 01:07:12,383
<i>No special interest,
no ambition.</i>

984
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:17,023
<i>Working for my glory, I
work for their happiness.</i>

985
01:07:22,696 --> 01:07:25,438
<i>Adrienne, my soul,</i>

986
01:07:25,907 --> 01:07:28,931
<i>and one more day has ended.</i>

987
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:37,065
<i>"The night does not allow me to continue, for I have
forbidden any light on my ship for several days."</i>

988
01:07:37,273 --> 01:07:40,255
Sometimes I ask myself,
but does it exist?

989
01:07:40,339 --> 01:07:41,402
Who!

990
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:43,071
America!

991
01:07:43,342 --> 01:07:44,948
We, probably, passed it.

992
01:07:45,052 --> 01:07:48,055
La Ruyri was lucky.
He is fond of birds.

993
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:49,890
Only after all they are all the same.

994
01:07:49,995 --> 01:07:51,705
And here not!

995
01:07:51,872 --> 01:07:55,292
These things are different.
Yes? And what?

996
01:07:56,293 --> 01:07:58,274
They are American.

997
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:02,966
Yes, these are no longer seabirds.
The earth is near!

998
01:08:03,237 --> 01:08:04,989
Thank God!

999
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:09,014
<i>Let's drink to this!</i>

1000
01:08:09,202 --> 01:08:11,725
Oh, obvious progress
in English, Marquis!

1001
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:15,292
But I never drink for success
"before", it's a bad omen.

1002
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:18,232
The ship is straight
ahead on the port side!

1003
01:08:18,316 --> 01:08:19,546
You see!

1004
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:22,549
What makes you think that he is English?
"I'll bet on my epaulet."

1005
01:08:22,633 --> 01:08:24,197
Agreed, Baron!

1006
01:08:27,429 --> 01:08:29,504
This is the English forte.

1007
01:08:30,766 --> 01:08:31,955
I won.

1008
01:08:36,564 --> 01:08:39,650
Believe me, Mr. Marquis,
raise the white flag.

1009
01:08:41,798 --> 01:08:43,383
Just touch it,

1010
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:45,802
and I will make you forget
the taste of tobacco!

1011
01:08:46,053 --> 01:08:47,638
Here I command!

1012
01:08:48,326 --> 01:08:50,286
Raise the alarm!

1013
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:57,898
The rest - stand around me.

1014
01:09:01,527 --> 01:09:02,914
The Baron!

1015
01:09:03,863 --> 01:09:07,304
My contract with the rebels does
not provide for sea fights.

1016
01:09:07,345 --> 01:09:08,701
Them - too!

1017
01:09:09,306 --> 01:09:10,724
Look at them!

1018
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:13,414
If you go with me,
then they too!

1019
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:16,876
Oh, I do not give you orders, Baron.
But you're an American officer!

1020
01:09:18,273 --> 01:09:21,589
And I'll die like a banal sailor?
I,

1021
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:23,967
which the sea can not stand!

1022
01:09:25,197 --> 01:09:27,929
Okay. Take the weapon!

1023
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:34,040
Come on!

1024
01:09:37,356 --> 01:09:38,565
Let's!

1025
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:41,819
Foreman!

1026
01:09:44,655 --> 01:09:47,157
Get ready for boarding!

1027
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,451
In the hold!

1028
01:09:50,494 --> 01:09:52,204
Prepare for battle!

1029
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:55,770
Unfasten the guns, prepare the
cores and pots with fire!

1030
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:59,003
To fight on both sides!
The Gunners are ready!

1031
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,630
Straighten Mars!

1032
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:03,779
Turn them a little bit so
they can see our flag!

1033
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:11,954
The ship is American!

1034
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:14,832
Hooray! American!

1035
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:22,048
"Hey, American ship!"
- ABOUT!

1036
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,424
4...

1037
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,239
5, 6,

1038
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:29,013
7, 8,

1039
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:30,702
9...

1040
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:38,888
Madonna... this is a miracle!

1041
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:41,192
I lost!

1042
01:10:44,446 --> 01:10:46,271
This is for you. I already have mine.

1043
01:10:46,302 --> 01:10:48,304
Oh thanks. Hooray!

1044
01:10:49,284 --> 01:10:52,558
Ahead of the earth on the starboard side!

1045
01:10:58,147 --> 01:11:00,285
My friends, this is America!

1046
01:11:00,337 --> 01:11:01,547
America!

1047
01:11:01,695 --> 01:11:04,592
We freely arrived here, so that the
young country could live freely!

1048
01:11:04,654 --> 01:11:07,053
We swear to either
win or perish!

1049
01:11:07,115 --> 01:11:08,763
We swear!

1050
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:13,351
PHILADELPHIA
THE AMERICAN CONGRESS.

1051
01:11:13,476 --> 01:11:16,521
<i>We will not let emotions dazzle ourselves!</i>

1052
01:11:16,687 --> 01:11:20,196
A large number
of so-called volunteers

1053
01:11:20,233 --> 01:11:23,966
of the French who are
sent to us by Mr. Dean,

1054
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:27,928
joined us exclusively
for the sake of money.

1055
01:11:28,116 --> 01:11:33,126
Their little interest in
our goal, they go here for work,

1056
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:38,043
for the sake of salaries and titles, which
they would not receive in their own country.

1057
01:11:38,272 --> 01:11:43,069
In my opinion, and I declare
this to you without obstructions,

1058
01:11:43,105 --> 01:11:46,406
such people here are undesirable!

1059
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:49,492
We do not need them!

1060
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:52,808
"Undesirable"...

1061
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,373
I'm asking for the floor!

1062
01:11:59,336 --> 01:12:00,670
Who are you, sir?

1063
01:12:00,712 --> 01:12:02,594
One of them is "undesirable"!

1064
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:06,447
Mr. Chairman...
I have not finished my speech yet!

1065
01:12:06,635 --> 01:12:09,450
When I'm done, I'll give the word to you.

1066
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:11,703
I'm sorry, sir.

1067
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:17,855
But I'm the Marquis de La Fayette.

1068
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,670
I arrived here with my friends,

1069
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:23,298
so... it's hard for me, sir.

1070
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:26,989
We crossed the sea on a ship
that I bought with my own money,

1071
01:12:27,073 --> 01:12:29,137
to help you in your war.

1072
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:33,089
My friends, my ship, my money -
YOUR war!

1073
01:12:34,163 --> 01:12:37,980
That's what we are "undesirable", Mr.
Chairman.

1074
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:39,278
Sorry.

1075
01:12:39,315 --> 01:12:42,881
May Lord Marquis
forgive my frankness,

1076
01:12:43,006 --> 01:12:46,614
but we need more
skilled artillerymen,

1077
01:12:46,676 --> 01:12:50,941
rather than in young aristocrats,

1078
01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:55,206
Hardly speaking our language!

1079
01:12:55,561 --> 01:13:01,900
Therefore, we can not approve your
contracts signed with Mr. Dean in Paris.

1080
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,223
Mr. Chairman...

1081
01:13:06,259 --> 01:13:08,949
...you do not understand
what your words mean for us!

1082
01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:11,994
For those who have overcome
so much to join you!

1083
01:13:12,098 --> 01:13:13,621
We left everything!

1084
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:15,081
<i>Threw it all!</i>

1085
01:13:15,206 --> 01:13:19,210
Our houses, our wives,
our children - everything!

1086
01:13:19,398 --> 01:13:22,234
To help you make
your country free!

1087
01:13:25,779 --> 01:13:27,719
Forget about the contracts of Mr. Dean.

1088
01:13:27,844 --> 01:13:29,278
Forget our contracts.

1089
01:13:29,314 --> 01:13:31,744
Forget my ship, forget my name.

1090
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:34,434
The only service, about
which we ask this assembly,

1091
01:13:34,517 --> 01:13:37,208
be soldiers!
Without contracts, without pay!

1092
01:13:37,244 --> 01:13:40,086
Without payment... but in your army!

1093
01:13:40,336 --> 01:13:43,235
Let us fight alongside you!

1094
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,625
The attractiveness of democracy
is that one can always explain.

1095
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:00,357
And not only to someone
one, but to all!

1096
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:02,108
Everyone has the right to speak.

1097
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:05,685
The Assembly passed a decision.
You can come back, gentlemen.

1098
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:24,215
<i>Speaks English.</i>

1099
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,927
"In view of the fact that
the Marquis de La Fayette"

1100
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:31,973
with such zeal perceived freedom,

1101
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:35,998
for which the United States is fighting,

1102
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:41,608
that he left his family and relatives
and at his own expense came here,

1103
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:48,615
to offer their services to the US,

1104
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:51,868
not requiring any content,

1105
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:55,017
nor a special status,

1106
01:14:55,122 --> 01:14:58,917
ready to risk his
life for our cause,

1107
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:03,380
The Congress decided...

1108
01:15:03,493 --> 01:15:05,695
...accept his services...

1109
01:15:07,447 --> 01:15:10,221
"Given his zeal,"

1110
01:15:10,283 --> 01:15:14,913
as well as the nobility of
his kind and his allies,

1111
01:15:18,604 --> 01:15:23,380
he will be promoted to the rank of
Major-General of the US Army...

1112
01:15:45,862 --> 01:15:47,301
Thank you.

1113
01:16:02,358 --> 01:16:03,672
Stop!

1114
01:16:05,465 --> 01:16:08,030
We came to General Washington.

1115
01:16:47,133 --> 01:16:50,856
Washington, what kind of person is he?
"A man rather than a general."

1116
01:16:51,014 --> 01:16:53,139
I can not stand babbling and flattery.

1117
01:16:53,202 --> 01:16:56,435
The man is very simple,
almost ascetic.

1118
01:16:56,539 --> 01:16:59,333
But his handshake
will break your hand!

1119
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:02,503
Even when he was a child,
he threw a coin in 1 dollar...

1120
01:17:02,545 --> 01:17:05,110
...to the other side of the Potomac.
- Braggart, then!

1121
01:17:05,194 --> 01:17:06,925
Oh, no, not at all!

1122
01:17:06,987 --> 01:17:10,094
Once he confessed that
he tore up the cherry.

1123
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,138
To which the father,
having forgiven him, said:

1124
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:15,350
"Better than 1,000 cherries torn
from the roots, than just one lie."

1125
01:17:15,412 --> 01:17:16,893
And he remembered that.

1126
01:17:16,994 --> 01:17:21,544
Never lie -
this should make life very difficult.

1127
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:25,485
With their people - no.
With politicians - yes.

1128
01:17:25,548 --> 01:17:27,727
They say he is very religious?

1129
01:17:27,779 --> 01:17:29,239
Yes very...

1130
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,152
On the shoulder!

1131
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:41,189
Free!

1132
01:17:44,401 --> 01:17:47,592
Welcome, Monsieur de La Fayette!

1133
01:17:47,821 --> 01:17:50,991
No, General. La Fayette is he.

1134
01:17:53,848 --> 01:17:56,517
"Are you La Fayette?"
Yes, monsieur.

1135
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,896
But you are so young!
You are my son's fit!

1136
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:02,680
"Like many of your soldiers."
This is yes...

1137
01:18:02,732 --> 01:18:05,277
But they are also the sons of America.

1138
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:09,030
And you are a Frenchman.
With a great fortune, from a noble family.

1139
01:18:09,322 --> 01:18:12,325
What can not be said
about most of my "sons".

1140
01:18:12,617 --> 01:18:15,057
Greatness does not come by birth, monsieur,

1141
01:18:15,141 --> 01:18:17,435
but in the struggle for great goals.

1142
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,272
Yes. And you already have a
good fight against Congress.

1143
01:18:21,606 --> 01:18:24,630
But the British -
even more uncompromising.

1144
01:18:25,652 --> 01:18:27,842
And you saw my troops.

1145
01:18:28,843 --> 01:18:31,846
I ask you to judge them
only after the battle.

1146
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:35,078
I came here not to
judge, but to study.

1147
01:18:35,641 --> 01:18:36,924
Good.

1148
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:41,168
Well, first you can study this.

1149
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:47,570
Cornwallis received reinforcements of
5 thousand Brandenburg mercenaries.

1150
01:18:47,758 --> 01:18:50,928
General Howe - 120 new guns.

1151
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:56,600
And General Clinton is a new
regiment of mountaineers.

1152
01:18:57,664 --> 01:19:01,001
And you, monsieur, a 20-year-old marquise,

1153
01:19:01,147 --> 01:19:05,130
Prussian baron, their field
assistants - that's all!

1154
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:08,071
Exactly.

1155
01:19:08,696 --> 01:19:10,969
And at the same time, I do not know why,

1156
01:19:11,345 --> 01:19:14,223
but I would not change.

1157
01:19:14,786 --> 01:19:16,225
Thank you, monsieur.

1158
01:19:16,809 --> 01:19:21,188
I think that the main thing in the war is to
have a commander for whom you are ready to die.

1159
01:19:22,773 --> 01:19:27,591
- Ha, they say he's a general!
- They are recruited right in the cradle.

1160
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:31,011
Smir-no!

1161
01:19:38,978 --> 01:19:41,819
- Hold it. 6 cartridges per person.
- Oh no!

1162
01:19:41,856 --> 01:19:45,359
- This is the order.
- "Do they want us to hunt squirrels?"

1163
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:48,341
Between 6 squirrels and
6 recruits, I put on recruits.

1164
01:19:48,378 --> 01:19:51,595
Exactly! 6-That's what I said.

1165
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,707
We do not go into battle, but we go back.

1166
01:19:54,744 --> 01:19:57,830
General Sullivan needs
all available ammunition,

1167
01:19:57,872 --> 01:20:00,270
to cover our retreat from the enemy.

1168
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:06,172
Here and so.

1169
01:20:07,132 --> 01:20:10,427
- "What command do you entrust to me?"
- "Not yet.

1170
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:12,351
But I have the rank of Major-General!

1171
01:20:12,387 --> 01:20:14,744
Yes, Major-General, who
did not smell gunpowder.

1172
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:16,829
But he imagined so many times!

1173
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:19,613
Command requires more
than imagination.

1174
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:22,366
"I can join Sullivan's army."
No.

1175
01:20:23,503 --> 01:20:25,588
I've taken care of you...

1176
01:20:26,214 --> 01:20:27,580
...my militiamen.

1177
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:30,948
Look at them.

1178
01:20:33,471 --> 01:20:35,870
Barefoot, hungry,

1179
01:20:35,974 --> 01:20:38,143
6 cartridges per person.

1180
01:20:38,247 --> 01:20:39,728
They have nothing.

1181
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:42,502
There is nothing to be proud of.

1182
01:20:43,273 --> 01:20:47,267
But if I give them commanders of
the famous Marquis de La Fayette,

1183
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:51,615
who came for three seas
to lead them into battle,

1184
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:56,203
I think this will raise their fighting
spirit more than shoes and ammunition.

1185
01:20:56,287 --> 01:20:57,872
Yes. But when?

1186
01:20:58,748 --> 01:21:00,499
Patience, my boy.

1187
01:21:00,854 --> 01:21:03,690
In war everything happens
faster than we think.

1188
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:06,360
Except, probably, a victory.

1189
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:11,615
Brandywine is not far, sir.

1190
01:21:13,092 --> 01:21:17,179
I heard that Washington received
reinforcements from France.

1191
01:21:17,216 --> 01:21:19,907
- Troops?
- "No, no, officers."

1192
01:21:19,932 --> 01:21:23,648
Soon we will fight
with some generals.

1193
01:22:00,236 --> 01:22:02,126
There they are, sir!

1194
01:22:04,595 --> 01:22:06,560
Wade is not guarded, sir!

1195
01:22:06,596 --> 01:22:08,924
- All right. Forward!
- Come on!

1196
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:43,543
Neither of our intentions. If
he remains in his positions...

1197
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:48,090
We will go to the back of Sullivan and
attack with the arrival of darkness.

1198
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:56,678
What's the matter, soldiers?

1199
01:22:56,703 --> 01:22:59,252
We're the intelligence
of Sullivan's army, sir!

1200
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:01,721
We could not go back,
the Scots cut us off.

1201
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:03,919
- Which side of the river?
- "On this one, sir."

1202
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:06,049
Cornwallis crossed the river.

1203
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:10,800
- Are they coming at us?
- No, sir, they're attacking Sullivan's army.

1204
01:23:12,202 --> 01:23:15,756
It looks like our intelligence
service was pierced.

1205
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,080
- What are we going to do for Sullivan?
- We will come to his aid!

1206
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:22,050
Our young friend answered
your question, Baron.

1207
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:24,699
- "Are we not leaving?"
-  Let's try.

1208
01:23:24,982 --> 01:23:27,431
Do you want to help Sullivan
with 6 cartridges per person?!

1209
01:23:27,493 --> 01:23:29,379
The necessary is
never impossible.

1210
01:23:29,441 --> 01:23:33,153
You have to do everything to save Sullivan's
artillery, because I do not have the other.

1211
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:35,155
General, do I command the militia?

1212
01:23:35,181 --> 01:23:38,517
Yes. Now you can take command.

1213
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:43,522
Youth - how wonderful it is!

1214
01:23:49,082 --> 01:23:52,552
I know you only have 6 rounds.

1215
01:23:52,582 --> 01:23:55,355
But I myself - only this!

1216
01:23:55,518 --> 01:23:57,099
Behind me!

1217
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:06,066
You were told, 2,000
people, monsieur?

1218
01:24:06,096 --> 01:24:08,515
There are 10 thousand of them, if not more.

1219
01:24:08,519 --> 01:24:12,385
Kalb, with your dragoons you are
defending the rearguard artillery.

1220
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:14,784
But still you must protect the bridge,

1221
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:19,180
for perhaps Cornwallis will want to
cut us off from the path to retreat.

1222
01:24:19,234 --> 01:24:21,395
Good luck, Baron!

1223
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:23,417
Thank you, monsieur.

1224
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:48,464
Hurry, you sons of bitches!

1225
01:24:51,059 --> 01:24:54,512
At this rate, you
will not be overtaken!

1226
01:25:01,828 --> 01:25:04,689
- "This is the avant-garde of Cornwallis."
- At last!

1227
01:25:05,336 --> 01:25:07,567
Gentlemen, good luck!

1228
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:43,917
{\ a9} They attack us on the right flank.
And they go into the bayonet!

1229
01:25:43,954 --> 01:25:46,806
{\ a9} So they do not have enough ammunition.

1230
01:25:47,066 --> 01:25:49,986
{\ a9} Put all the infantry into battle.

1231
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,489
{\ a9} And let the artillery be at full force.

1232
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,882
{\ a10} Punch cold.

1233
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:10,695
The first line, forward!

1234
01:26:11,206 --> 01:26:12,687
Fire!

1235
01:26:22,165 --> 01:26:24,459
Fire!

1236
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,700
Fire!

1237
01:26:56,638 --> 01:26:58,839
Get in line!

1238
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,790
Get in line!

1239
01:27:07,691 --> 01:27:11,946
This is the gentleman who
deserves to be considered closer!

1240
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:22,081
Do not run! To be built!

1241
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:24,699
Do not give up!

1242
01:27:25,919 --> 01:27:28,452
Group!

1243
01:27:33,103 --> 01:27:36,648
I thought so! This is La Fayette!

1244
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:38,411
- Marquis?
- Yes.

1245
01:27:38,589 --> 01:27:42,102
- How do you know?
- "I met him in England." On the hunt.

1246
01:27:42,217 --> 01:27:44,151
On a different kind of hunt.

1247
01:27:44,188 --> 01:27:48,536
Terrific! And I knew his father.
In the Battle of Mirindene.

1248
01:27:48,713 --> 01:27:52,196
Not for long - just to kill him.

1249
01:27:52,821 --> 01:27:56,669
It seems that the
same fate awaits his son.

1250
01:27:57,118 --> 01:27:59,026
Fire!

1251
01:27:59,704 --> 01:28:02,571
Gilbert! Are you hurt?

1252
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,500
{\ a10} Sorry!

1253
01:28:05,731 --> 01:28:08,494
- Give up!
- Never!

1254
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:33,488
Doctor...

1255
01:28:35,157 --> 01:28:37,190
You said French, sir?

1256
01:28:37,847 --> 01:28:39,390
Yes.

1257
01:28:39,568 --> 01:28:42,102
There are several of them.

1258
01:28:42,696 --> 01:28:44,990
You said he's a major?

1259
01:28:45,084 --> 01:28:48,196
Major General, Sergeant.

1260
01:28:48,233 --> 01:28:51,272
But he's almost a boy!

1261
01:28:51,309 --> 01:28:54,156
There are no ranks here...

1262
01:28:54,192 --> 01:28:57,002
Yes, they do not matter here.

1263
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:31,204
It's not as bad as it seems, sir.
But he lost a lot of blood.

1264
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:33,290
This is one of the French.

1265
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:36,387
Very stubborn.

1266
01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:38,707
Refuses to go to the hospital.

1267
01:29:38,743 --> 01:29:42,195
Let him be transported to Mount Vernon.
Immediately!

1268
01:29:42,435 --> 01:29:44,312
- To your house, sir?
- Yes.

1269
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:49,045
- I doubt that he will agree.
- "And you do not say where he's being taken."

1270
01:29:53,088 --> 01:29:55,257
Calb! Is he...

1271
01:29:55,319 --> 01:29:58,159
Yes! Yes.

1272
01:29:58,339 --> 01:30:01,288
He managed to cross.

1273
01:30:16,862 --> 01:30:18,739
Where are you taking me?

1274
01:30:18,802 --> 01:30:21,287
Where? Where are we going?

1275
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:38,879
Casper! Casper!

1276
01:30:40,474 --> 01:30:42,320
Quickly!

1277
01:30:57,798 --> 01:31:01,589
Welcome to Mount Vernon!

1278
01:31:01,626 --> 01:31:03,915
Thank you very much, madam.

1279
01:31:07,846 --> 01:31:12,351
Your husband played a joke with me.
I should not be here.

1280
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:14,436
I'm ashamed!

1281
01:31:14,613 --> 01:31:17,679
Shameful? Why are you ashamed, monsieur?

1282
01:31:17,716 --> 01:31:19,558
Get in bed!

1283
01:31:19,595 --> 01:31:21,402
Do not be so upset!

1284
01:31:21,495 --> 01:31:25,604
This risk threatens only the brave!

1285
01:31:26,584 --> 01:31:29,686
Oh! Adrianna? Is this your wife?

1286
01:31:29,723 --> 01:31:32,788
Do I correctly pronounce her name?

1287
01:31:32,825 --> 01:31:35,583
Yes... fine.

1288
01:31:36,302 --> 01:31:39,045
Stay here, I'll be right back.

1289
01:31:40,134 --> 01:31:47,804
My husband said that you are allowed
only one lesson - writing to Adrianne.

1290
01:31:47,887 --> 01:31:49,488
Is that all he said?

1291
01:31:49,524 --> 01:31:54,947
No. He said that I should
treat you like his own son.

1292
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,397
Madame...

1293
01:31:58,648 --> 01:32:01,234
Tell him I'm grateful.

1294
01:32:06,511 --> 01:32:09,045
<i>"Because you are the wife
of an American officer,"</i>

1295
01:32:09,128 --> 01:32:11,902
<i>I must give you my instructions.</i>

1296
01:32:13,641 --> 01:32:15,593
<i>You will be told:</i>

1297
01:32:15,624 --> 01:32:18,544
<i>"They were again defeated at Philadelphia."</i>

1298
01:32:18,938 --> 01:32:20,338
<i>You'll answer:</i>

1299
01:32:20,421 --> 01:32:24,978
<i>"It's true, but on the plain, with
two armies of the same strength,</i>

1300
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:28,054
<i>experienced soldiers always have
an advantage over newcomers. "</i>

1301
01:32:28,137 --> 01:32:30,077
Nothing will undermine his spirit!

1302
01:32:30,171 --> 01:32:33,862
And he says that nothing will also
undermine the spirit of the rebels.

1303
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:38,513
<i>"Seeing the courage of these people, I
tell myself that if the king saw them..."</i>

1304
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:40,442
King, madame!

1305
01:32:41,161 --> 01:32:44,196
I asked His Majesty to come.

1306
01:32:44,373 --> 01:32:46,375
Do not hide the letter, madam.

1307
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:50,066
I, for my part, also have news from M.
De La Fayette,

1308
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:53,017
but the letter sent to
you, I'm also interested.

1309
01:32:53,132 --> 01:32:56,709
He is in America against
your will, but he is there!

1310
01:32:56,886 --> 01:33:01,599
Can you have a better observer
than an American major general?

1311
01:33:01,891 --> 01:33:04,873
What does he say about Philadelphia?

1312
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:11,338
<i>"You will be objected:" This is a disaster!
It's the capital of America! "</i>

1313
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:15,061
<i>This is a boulevard of freedom..."
No one for his tongue pulls.</i>

1314
01:33:16,854 --> 01:33:19,597
<i>You will politely answer:</i>

1315
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:21,495
Well?

1316
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,414
<i>"You're stupid!"</i>

1317
01:33:25,488 --> 01:33:28,564
Speeches without blunt!

1318
01:33:30,462 --> 01:33:32,339
Why?

1319
01:33:32,881 --> 01:33:36,781
<i>"Philadelphia is a sad city,
its port is already closed.</i>

1320
01:33:36,948 --> 01:33:41,849
<i>Only Congress made it famous. But
it has no strategic significance. "</i>

1321
01:33:42,162 --> 01:33:43,841
And Washington?

1322
01:33:44,112 --> 01:33:46,854
About half the letter, sir.

1323
01:33:46,938 --> 01:33:52,005
<i>He says that this is "the greatest military
and wisest statesman in the world."</i>

1324
01:33:52,068 --> 01:33:55,884
He admires and loves
him as his father.

1325
01:33:57,104 --> 01:34:00,670
Your husband, in addition
to the American uniform,

1326
01:34:00,764 --> 01:34:03,121
there is a heart.
-"Oh, no, Sire."

1327
01:34:03,444 --> 01:34:06,989
He always repeats to me
that he fights for France.

1328
01:34:08,147 --> 01:34:09,972
And how is his health?

1329
01:34:10,274 --> 01:34:12,235
He does not write to me, sir.

1330
01:34:13,163 --> 01:34:14,737
Good.

1331
01:34:20,097 --> 01:34:22,036
He was wounded.

1332
01:34:22,787 --> 01:34:25,550
He hides it.
Do not say anything, sir!

1333
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:31,004
Do not be afraid. He disobeyed me, but I
respect the courage of him and his wife.

1334
01:34:31,275 --> 01:34:33,924
And I'm not jealous of him for Washington.

1335
01:34:41,369 --> 01:34:44,476
Oh, my dear! How's your boy?

1336
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:46,499
Oh, he's more obedient now.

1337
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:49,627
Proof: I could have escaped, but
I'm sitting, waiting for you.

1338
01:34:49,742 --> 01:34:52,099
So I'm doubly glad to see you.

1339
01:34:52,213 --> 01:34:55,821
You do not have to wait
any longer, my boy.

1340
01:35:00,587 --> 01:35:03,402
No, La Fayette, it's
too early to walk!

1341
01:35:03,475 --> 01:35:05,560
No, no, it's okay.

1342
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:09,168
I received a letter.
I want you to read it.

1343
01:35:09,262 --> 01:35:11,702
- From France?
- No. Hence.

1344
01:35:11,796 --> 01:35:13,965
From a member of Congress, Conway.

1345
01:35:14,267 --> 01:35:17,364
Conway? "Read it, please."

1346
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:31,629
He proposes to you, to summarize,
to open a second front.

1347
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:34,580
Yes. Personally lead the
expedition to Canada.

1348
01:35:34,643 --> 01:35:37,677
What, if successful, could
bring Canada back to France.

1349
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:39,710
Exactly. What do you think of it?

1350
01:35:39,794 --> 01:35:43,819
Oh, this offer is very beneficial
for you personally and for France.

1351
01:35:43,913 --> 01:35:47,541
Yes, maybe... But I made
inquiries about this Conway.

1352
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:56,540
A! My wife alarmed you for no reason.
Do not believe in women.

1353
01:35:56,572 --> 01:35:57,969
Yours, I believe.

1354
01:35:58,209 --> 01:36:01,785
Conway started intrigues against you.
"Intrigue" is a big word.

1355
01:36:01,869 --> 01:36:03,902
Maybe.
But this is the right word.

1356
01:36:03,954 --> 01:36:06,373
He made me this offer
to tear off from you.

1357
01:36:06,436 --> 01:36:08,574
Yes, but you can find pros here.

1358
01:36:08,667 --> 01:36:11,441
Politics does not
end with the war.

1359
01:36:11,556 --> 01:36:14,569
And, first of all, you are a Frenchman!

1360
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:18,792
Monsieur, if the United States has already begun
to disengage, what is the point of fighting?

1361
01:36:19,032 --> 01:36:21,889
And I do not fight so that the
British give Canada Canada,

1362
01:36:22,077 --> 01:36:24,183
and to give America to the Americans!

1363
01:36:24,204 --> 01:36:26,185
I've been thinking a lot, monsieur.

1364
01:36:26,331 --> 01:36:28,542
We still can not
beat the English.

1365
01:36:28,688 --> 01:36:32,296
They should be harassed,
pulled, until the day,

1366
01:36:32,442 --> 01:36:36,884
When we can call them to battle and
in a place that we choose ourselves!

1367
01:36:38,313 --> 01:36:42,181
I'm sorry if I said stupid.
No, it's not stupid.

1368
01:36:42,358 --> 01:36:47,812
I myself have been thinking for some time about
a campaign of attacks, skirmishes with them.

1369
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:51,660
And, frankly, I even thought
of entrusting it to you.

1370
01:36:51,774 --> 01:36:55,142
"Then I'm coming with you!"
"Only when you can walk."

1371
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:59,428
But look! I go! I can walk!

1372
01:37:00,888 --> 01:37:04,016
La Fayette, I was also young.

1373
01:37:04,141 --> 01:37:06,342
I like this self-confidence,
this passion.

1374
01:37:06,435 --> 01:37:11,920
But I can advise you one thing that has
been very useful to me since my youth:

1375
01:37:12,066 --> 01:37:14,840
Patience!

1376
01:37:16,269 --> 01:37:18,114
Patience...

1377
01:37:18,145 --> 01:37:21,691
La Fayette was capable of
everything except patience.

1378
01:37:21,805 --> 01:37:23,881
And the same evening...

1379
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:30,773
<i>Thank you!
Your grateful son, Gilbert.</i>

1380
01:37:42,514 --> 01:37:45,340
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

1381
01:37:51,211 --> 01:37:52,942
Friends!

1382
01:37:56,039 --> 01:37:58,604
But the Iroquois were for the English?

1383
01:37:58,656 --> 01:38:01,763
- They were. La Fayette lured them.
- Clear.

1384
01:38:01,847 --> 01:38:04,475
Yes, there are victories
worth talking about.

1385
01:38:04,767 --> 01:38:06,769
Listen to me carefully, Kirov.

1386
01:38:07,123 --> 01:38:09,626
Here's the plan I'm offering you.

1387
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:12,608
Tonight you and your warriors...

1388
01:38:33,724 --> 01:38:37,060
Do not shoot, these
are friendly Indians!

1389
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:41,826
Friendly?
And what then are the enemy?

1390
01:38:51,721 --> 01:38:54,047
Ambush!

1391
01:39:14,568 --> 01:39:17,790
Forgive me, gentlemen,
I have finished cognac,

1392
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:21,012
but I'm waiting for the
delivery of the magnificent port.

1393
01:39:21,544 --> 01:39:23,452
Ah, there he is!

1394
01:39:23,953 --> 01:39:27,769
We have been waiting impatiently
for you, Phillips, for you and port.

1395
01:39:27,806 --> 01:39:29,818
- I'm sorry, sir, but he's not.
- What?

1396
01:39:29,855 --> 01:39:33,285
Are you all drunk?
All the provisions have been taken from us.

1397
01:39:33,322 --> 01:39:35,991
My dear Phillips, but it's a disaster!

1398
01:39:36,028 --> 01:39:42,399
Give the entire port to the enemy
headquarters - this is a tactical error!

1399
01:39:42,513 --> 01:39:45,047
And who is responsible for this blow?

1400
01:39:45,141 --> 01:39:48,087
- Monsieur de La Fayette.
- Oh no! Again he!

1401
01:39:48,123 --> 01:39:52,711
I can not wait until it's over, and I
can tell this boy what I think about him!

1402
01:39:52,748 --> 01:39:56,851
- This is a small war and a small officer.
- "Neither, Phillips."

1403
01:39:57,174 --> 01:40:02,326
Refusing a pre-losing battle -
this is sanity.

1404
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:06,653
But La Fayette pulls us to
the left, then to the right...

1405
01:40:06,689 --> 01:40:08,525
and never - face to face.

1406
01:40:08,561 --> 01:40:13,264
He learned to leave us with
an unquenchable thirst for battle...

1407
01:40:16,069 --> 01:40:18,207
and booze!

1408
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:34,004
<i>"What a long wait, beloved..."</i>

1409
01:40:34,088 --> 01:40:37,049
<i>And you are so far away,
surrounded by such dangers,</i>

1410
01:40:37,112 --> 01:40:40,532
<i>that every moment I tremble
for your precious life.</i>

1411
01:40:40,636 --> 01:40:43,681
<i>I am supported only by the
actions that I take to help you</i>

1412
01:40:43,743 --> 01:40:45,933
<i>before the king and queen.</i>

1413
01:40:46,017 --> 01:40:48,665
<i>She is a woman, she
understands my fears.</i>

1414
01:40:48,728 --> 01:40:52,523
<i>"But its location does not quench
my thirst for your embrace..."</i>

1415
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,759
You are summoned to General Washington,
Gilbert. It is very important.

1416
01:41:04,014 --> 01:41:05,405
Pass this order.

1417
01:41:05,495 --> 01:41:08,248
Ah, mister marquis! I've
been waiting for you.

1418
01:41:08,602 --> 01:41:11,772
So, gentlemen.
The threat from the north fades.

1419
01:41:11,898 --> 01:41:16,569
Burgoyne walked away. And I
order General Gates to start moving.

1420
01:41:17,195 --> 01:41:19,218
It's time to attack.

1421
01:41:19,447 --> 01:41:21,991
We will attack Burgoyne here!

1422
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:23,514
In Saratoga!

1423
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,559
Here, where we lured them...

1424
01:41:27,455 --> 01:41:30,438
there we will break them!

1425
01:41:32,168 --> 01:41:36,173
The rebels won a crushing
victory over the British,

1426
01:41:36,235 --> 01:41:38,529
capturing the city of Saratoga!

1427
01:41:43,451 --> 01:41:46,871
- Long live what?
- Saratoga, sir.

1428
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:51,689
The city taken by the rebels, after the
complete defeat of the British army.

1429
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:54,504
"City"! Rather, the settlement.

1430
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:58,175
As for the British army, it can not
be defeated in one single battle.

1431
01:41:58,341 --> 01:42:02,471
And why are they shouting under our
windows? This is not a French victory.

1432
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:06,454
The people, Sire, want to show
you who his sympathies are with.

1433
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:09,958
If you follow the sympathies of the
people, where will it lead us?

1434
01:42:10,145 --> 01:42:13,857
And if we follow the antipathies of the
minister, where does this lead us?

1435
01:42:13,962 --> 01:42:17,215
Washington! "Now Washington..."

1436
01:42:17,474 --> 01:42:21,720
This is a fact: The people are
fascinated by this war. First.

1437
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:23,180
This is their war, sir.

1438
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:26,224
No, this is not a war. This is an uprising.

1439
01:42:26,287 --> 01:42:28,915
And even more, monsieur:
This is a struggle for independence.

1440
01:42:28,977 --> 01:42:32,356
- In which France is completely neutral.
- No, not perfect.

1441
01:42:32,481 --> 01:42:33,962
Mr. de La Fayette is a Frenchman.

1442
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:37,027
Now you will say that we must follow Mr.
De La Fayette?

1443
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:39,421
"It's not me talking, it's the people!"
"But the people..."

1444
01:42:39,446 --> 01:42:43,596
You are not here to argue,
gentlemen, but to give me advice.

1445
01:42:45,557 --> 01:42:47,350
I'm listening to you.

1446
01:42:48,456 --> 01:42:53,148
The victory at Saratoga
fills our hearts with joy.

1447
01:42:53,795 --> 01:42:57,277
But we will not make the same
mistake as our opponents.

1448
01:42:57,382 --> 01:42:59,947
Do not underestimate their army.

1449
01:43:00,677 --> 01:43:03,471
We need other victories.

1450
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:08,247
And for this we need
the help of France.

1451
01:43:09,561 --> 01:43:13,210
I express my gratitude
to Madame de La Fayette,

1452
01:43:13,294 --> 01:43:17,454
which struggles to get this
support from the queen.

1453
01:43:17,715 --> 01:43:20,343
What is equivalent to the
support of the king.

1454
01:43:20,447 --> 01:43:23,012
A letter from the King, Mr. Ambassador.

1455
01:43:28,414 --> 01:43:29,623
Excuse me, ma'am.

1456
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:42,574
Hold it.

1457
01:43:42,637 --> 01:43:44,430
Read it, madam.

1458
01:43:44,493 --> 01:43:47,454
This victory is bigger
than under Saratoga!

1459
01:43:47,809 --> 01:43:51,500
Without you and your husband,
we would not have won it.

1460
01:43:51,834 --> 01:43:56,276
"Draft allied treaty between
France and the United States!"

1461
01:44:01,615 --> 01:44:05,681
From the ship "Alliance"
La Fayette again saw the coast of France.

1462
01:44:05,765 --> 01:44:07,715
But it was not a return.

1463
01:44:07,767 --> 01:44:12,438
The young Major-General of the American
Army went on this trip with a special task.

1464
01:44:34,753 --> 01:44:37,277
Stand on the roadside, this
is the royal carriage.

1465
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:46,474
My soul!

1466
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:53,137
Let me look at you.

1467
01:45:00,676 --> 01:45:02,323
Gilbert...

1468
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:12,730
To Versailles!

1469
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:14,252
The first thing is the king!

1470
01:45:15,712 --> 01:45:18,465
Hey, now slow.
We have plenty of time.

1471
01:45:26,598 --> 01:45:29,789
Mr. Marquis de La Fayette, the
envoy of General Washington,

1472
01:45:29,852 --> 01:45:31,885
and Madame de La Fayette!

1473
01:45:40,571 --> 01:45:43,282
My dear, I always believed
that my son-in-law

1474
01:45:43,449 --> 01:45:45,993
real hero.

1475
01:45:47,779 --> 01:45:50,056
Mr. De La Fayette, the envoy
of General Washington.

1476
01:45:50,198 --> 01:45:51,666
Let him come in.

1477
01:46:06,681 --> 01:46:10,540
I will be grateful to you, monsieur, if you
do not come to me in a foreign uniform.

1478
01:46:10,623 --> 01:46:14,335
"I remained loyal to you subjects."
"Devotees"?

1479
01:46:14,523 --> 01:46:17,151
When you like it.

1480
01:46:17,839 --> 01:46:20,758
Your case is very serious, monsieur.
And delicate.

1481
01:46:20,842 --> 01:46:22,823
As your Majesty
decides, it will.

1482
01:46:22,865 --> 01:46:26,191
That's it!
Decide in such a difficult matter!

1483
01:46:26,556 --> 01:46:28,808
I should arrest you.
As you tell me, sir.

1484
01:46:28,892 --> 01:46:30,435
As you tell me, as you say...

1485
01:46:30,581 --> 01:46:33,021
And how will Mr. Washington order?

1486
01:46:33,313 --> 01:46:35,565
But we have an
alliance with him now.

1487
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:37,422
That's right, sir.

1488
01:46:38,485 --> 01:46:40,300
And what say you, madam?

1489
01:46:40,904 --> 01:46:44,429
It is quite clear that M. De La
Fayette deserved punishment.

1490
01:46:44,533 --> 01:46:45,972
If that's what the queen says...

1491
01:46:46,035 --> 01:46:49,079
If I were you, my friend, I would put Mr.
De La Fayette under arrest...

1492
01:46:49,184 --> 01:46:51,394
Is not it!
"In the estate of de Noeille."

1493
01:46:51,853 --> 01:46:54,523
Tet-a-tet with his charming wife,

1494
01:46:54,606 --> 01:46:57,088
which he so unworthily abandoned.

1495
01:47:00,654 --> 01:47:02,573
I would notice to Your Majesty...

1496
01:47:02,635 --> 01:47:04,804
No! Do not look at me!

1497
01:47:04,867 --> 01:47:06,702
The queen has a tremendous
political flair.

1498
01:47:06,785 --> 01:47:09,204
If Mr. de La Fayette remains
locked in the Noail estate,

1499
01:47:09,246 --> 01:47:11,863
he can not be a triumphant
in the salons of Paris,

1500
01:47:11,916 --> 01:47:13,542
and this is the main thing.

1501
01:47:15,795 --> 01:47:19,236
So, monsieur, you are placed
under strict arrest. At home.

1502
01:47:19,861 --> 01:47:21,968
And I forbid you to
leave your wife.

1503
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:23,865
I will personally track it.

1504
01:47:24,074 --> 01:47:25,993
You are too kind, sire.

1505
01:47:26,264 --> 01:47:28,996
And now, Mr. Major General,

1506
01:47:29,913 --> 01:47:32,666
tell me a little about
these Americans...

1507
01:47:36,024 --> 01:47:38,652
La Fayette told the king
about the Americans,

1508
01:47:38,797 --> 01:47:41,383
and even a lot and a long time.

1509
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:44,866
For many months -
King, Queen, Morp...

1510
01:47:44,971 --> 01:47:48,161
England also has a
sire, a powerful ally:

1511
01:47:48,245 --> 01:47:49,788
"Hunger."
- Hey!

1512
01:47:49,913 --> 01:47:52,645
Hey, the stagecoach, guys!

1513
01:47:53,584 --> 01:47:57,317
With the arrival of each stagecoach,
they hope that he is carrying food and money.

1514
01:48:00,007 --> 01:48:02,218
Stagecoach from Baltimore.

1515
01:48:05,221 --> 01:48:07,723
I hope that delegates from
Congress are coming with him.

1516
01:48:07,807 --> 01:48:10,601
But first of all I hope for
a letter from M. De La Fayette.

1517
01:48:10,638 --> 01:48:13,125
- But it's been 7 months since he left.
- So what?

1518
01:48:13,187 --> 01:48:16,842
You've received many emails from him.
But that's all.

1519
01:48:16,879 --> 01:48:20,820
They are more useful to me
than all the help from the Congress.

1520
01:48:21,029 --> 01:48:25,054
Bad General
Washington feeds his horses!

1521
01:48:26,055 --> 01:48:27,786
And your people too.

1522
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:58,150
- "From La Fayette?"
- No.

1523
01:48:59,902 --> 01:49:01,889
Welcome, gentlemen.
Thank you sir.

1524
01:49:01,925 --> 01:49:05,408
My name is William Livingstone,
the elected congressman from New Jersey.

1525
01:49:05,491 --> 01:49:06,701
Congratulations!

1526
01:49:06,743 --> 01:49:08,891
And once again united in a new struggle:

1527
01:49:08,974 --> 01:49:12,978
Washington against the Congress,
La Fayette v. Versailles.

1528
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:14,271
<i>Poverty, sir...</i>

1529
01:49:14,355 --> 01:49:17,483
<i>The captain can not even buy a
pair of boots for his salary!</i>

1530
01:49:17,587 --> 01:49:19,777
<i>And loans for which
Congress votes?</i>

1531
01:49:19,881 --> 01:49:21,862
<i>They do not cost French gold.</i>

1532
01:49:21,946 --> 01:49:24,907
<i>French gold should serve
primarily France!</i>

1533
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:28,828
<i>May your Majesty forgive me, but the
gold spent on one Versailles castle,</i>

1534
01:49:28,849 --> 01:49:31,013
<i>it would be enough to dress
the entire American army.</i>

1535
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:35,543
<i>For my part, I will give all my fortune, until
the last lyroid, until the last centime!</i>

1536
01:49:35,627 --> 01:49:38,901
<i>Washington will be able to win
only if it has ships, more ships,</i>

1537
01:49:38,943 --> 01:49:40,819
<i>a soldier, a soldier,</i>

1538
01:49:40,861 --> 01:49:42,853
<i>money, more money!</i>

1539
01:49:42,905 --> 01:49:45,470
Money, money, money...

1540
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,270
I would like to remind you, sir,

1541
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:56,690
But you must understand Congress!

1542
01:49:56,836 --> 01:50:00,340
Give us victory, we
will give you money!

1543
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:03,843
Give me money, and
I will give you victory!

1544
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:11,163
After Saratoga, much time passed.

1545
01:50:11,622 --> 01:50:14,250
And we're all waiting.

1546
01:50:16,231 --> 01:50:17,795
Are you waiting?

1547
01:50:20,048 --> 01:50:21,533
Waiting for what?

1548
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:23,702
- When you start the attack!
- "Attack?" Where?

1549
01:50:23,739 --> 01:50:26,080
- I do not know where, but the attack!
- Attack to what?

1550
01:50:26,116 --> 01:50:30,412
- I do not know what. Attack!
- "Do not attack on an empty stomach, sir!"

1551
01:50:33,124 --> 01:50:37,128
Until cardinal changes occur,

1552
01:50:37,232 --> 01:50:40,756
my army will shrink
because of three things:

1553
01:50:40,882 --> 01:50:42,425
Hunger,

1554
01:50:42,592 --> 01:50:47,472
decomposition and flight.
And there's nothing to be done about it.

1555
01:50:52,769 --> 01:50:55,981
I think it's time to
inspect the troops, General!

1556
01:50:58,441 --> 01:51:02,279
<i>American troops are not just Americans.
There is enough of everything.</i>

1557
01:51:02,425 --> 01:51:05,532
<i>For lack of reinforcements, Washington
has to take everyone in a row.</i>

1558
01:51:05,615 --> 01:51:08,702
<i>Adventurers for a long time can not
withstand deprivation and discipline.</i>

1559
01:51:08,738 --> 01:51:10,459
This is disgusting!

1560
01:51:10,496 --> 01:51:12,831
How can you so neglect people?!

1561
01:51:12,998 --> 01:51:16,585
You said three battalions?
Where is the third?

1562
01:51:21,132 --> 01:51:23,947
- Where is the third battalion?
- "Here, sir."

1563
01:51:24,573 --> 01:51:27,080
Ah... where are the others?

1564
01:51:27,117 --> 01:51:29,161
They all deserted, sir!

1565
01:51:30,892 --> 01:51:35,229
My duty, sir, to report to Congress

1566
01:51:35,334 --> 01:51:37,565
sentences.

1567
01:51:37,753 --> 01:51:40,172
What exactly do you mean, sir?

1568
01:51:41,402 --> 01:51:44,301
I will propose to
change the higher command.

1569
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:48,493
Do you have any wishes
that I could give to Congress?

1570
01:51:48,530 --> 01:51:50,328
Yes, there is.

1571
01:51:50,516 --> 01:51:55,396
Tell your beautiful congressmen that I'm not
fighting for them, but for the American people!

1572
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:59,901
And that I will continue to do
this, whether they agree with me or not.

1573
01:52:00,401 --> 01:52:04,447
And I beg you to read this letter
from Mr. Benjamin Franklin to Congress.

1574
01:52:04,539 --> 01:52:08,331
Read them all, especially
the place where he says:

1575
01:52:08,368 --> 01:52:14,478
<i> "Monsieur de La Fayette fights with all
zeal with the whole royal court for America."</i>

1576
01:52:14,515 --> 01:52:18,759
Hmm, fighting against the
Versailles court should be very pleasant.

1577
01:52:18,795 --> 01:52:24,364
Pleasantness, sir, will be when La Fayette
will receive for us 60 million livres

1578
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,003
and so we need reinforcements.

1579
01:52:27,158 --> 01:52:29,895
I'll give your letter
to Congress, General.

1580
01:52:29,932 --> 01:52:34,103
Despite my strong doubts about Mr.
Marquis...

1581
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:39,150
and his well-known
wishes, issued for reality.

1582
01:52:39,588 --> 01:52:41,256
Have a nice day, sir!

1583
01:52:45,677 --> 01:52:48,472
You are also a good lawyer, monsieur.

1584
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:53,456
We will send to Mr. Washington 4 thousand
people and 60 ships, as you asked.

1585
01:52:53,519 --> 01:52:56,730
Americans are also a
generous people, monsieur.

1586
01:52:57,064 --> 01:53:01,318
They will never forget the help of
France if France needs their help.

1587
01:53:01,381 --> 01:53:04,593
The help of America?
In any case, not in victory in the war.

1588
01:53:04,634 --> 01:53:05,886
In the war, monsieur.

1589
01:53:05,948 --> 01:53:08,764
Soldiers of freedom are the best of all.

1590
01:53:08,826 --> 01:53:10,182
Maybe.

1591
01:53:10,265 --> 01:53:13,164
But ours, being only
soldiers of the king...

1592
01:53:15,938 --> 01:53:19,566
must be under an experienced command.

1593
01:53:22,507 --> 01:53:26,866
This is the Count de Roshambo. He will
command the ground forces in America.

1594
01:53:32,559 --> 01:53:37,898
You understand, monsieur, that the king can not entrust
such responsibility to the 20-year-old lieutenant.

1595
01:53:38,774 --> 01:53:41,673
Let the general of the American army.

1596
01:53:42,006 --> 01:53:44,571
I can only command with
your help, monsieur.

1597
01:53:44,717 --> 01:53:46,490
Full and sincere.

1598
01:53:47,032 --> 01:53:49,827
But, maybe I broke
your ambitions?

1599
01:53:49,994 --> 01:53:52,684
I have no other ambitions
than to serve!

1600
01:54:27,866 --> 01:54:29,639
General, here I am!

1601
01:54:41,297 --> 01:54:44,279
And... not alone!

1602
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,567
French fleet?

1603
01:56:01,651 --> 01:56:04,007
So does France have a fleet?

1604
01:56:04,132 --> 01:56:07,532
Do England want to take away not
only the colonies, but also the sea?

1605
01:56:07,615 --> 01:56:09,977
Under the command of Admiral Grass.

1606
01:56:10,013 --> 01:56:14,435
They say more about the
reinforcement of 4 thousand Frenchmen.

1607
01:56:14,768 --> 01:56:17,062
- For La Fayette?
- "Oh, no, sir."

1608
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:19,210
Commander General de Roshambo.

1609
01:56:19,523 --> 01:56:22,047
The devil's a boy.

1610
01:56:22,234 --> 01:56:25,133
I prepared a surprise for him.

1611
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:27,281
Does he like to run?

1612
01:56:27,573 --> 01:56:29,450
He will have to run very fast.

1613
01:56:29,515 --> 01:56:32,578
And this time he will not leave me.

1614
01:56:49,054 --> 01:56:51,598
Captain Spears, returned from Yorktown.

1615
01:56:52,015 --> 01:56:55,811
- What's the news, Spears?
- "The squadron has entered the Shakespeare Bay."

1616
01:56:55,999 --> 01:56:58,397
The frigate dropped anchor.

1617
01:56:58,522 --> 01:57:00,962
- French?
- "No, sir, English."

1618
01:57:04,507 --> 01:57:07,364
- You must have been mistaken!
- "I do not think so, sir."

1619
01:57:07,552 --> 01:57:10,388
General La Fayette himself saw the ships.

1620
01:57:10,597 --> 01:57:12,307
A lot of them.

1621
01:57:13,934 --> 01:57:15,274
English!

1622
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:18,438
The situation is critical.
The ship's guns will get it.

1623
01:57:18,564 --> 01:57:20,274
He's waiting for your instructions.

1624
01:57:51,910 --> 01:57:54,059
Return to General La Fayette.

1625
01:57:54,351 --> 01:57:58,793
Tell them that Roshambo's army will step out
from the north, and mine from the west.

1626
01:57:58,829 --> 01:58:03,089
Without waiting for us,
General La Fayette is ordered

1627
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:05,758
remove redoubt,
covering Yorktown.

1628
01:58:05,946 --> 01:58:09,700
But General La Fayette risks falling into
a vice between the English fleet and Cornwallis!

1629
01:58:12,807 --> 01:58:16,874
But like La Fayette himself, I'm
counting on the arrival of the French fleet.

1630
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:19,230
Or Cornwallis will be blocked here,

1631
01:58:19,502 --> 01:58:21,524
or we will be broken...

1632
01:58:43,088 --> 01:58:44,407
Follow me!

1633
01:58:44,444 --> 01:58:47,739
We'll go along the
forest, behind the redoubt.

1634
01:58:47,864 --> 01:58:49,804
Let's go through my style.

1635
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:58,146
It seems. They're going
to attack Phillips's position!

1636
01:58:58,390 --> 01:59:00,919
Strange idea!

1637
01:59:01,399 --> 01:59:03,422
What does Washington want to do?

1638
01:59:04,506 --> 01:59:07,515
The fleet anchored
in Shakespeare Bay.

1639
01:59:07,551 --> 01:59:13,370
If they capture our fleet, the
ship's guns will not be able to help us.

1640
01:59:13,974 --> 01:59:17,436
Perhaps this is a maneuver
to smoke you out of Yorktown, sir?

1641
01:59:17,473 --> 01:59:20,898
Look, they only
used a handful of people.

1642
01:59:21,357 --> 01:59:24,261
I agree. I will not move.

1643
01:59:24,298 --> 01:59:28,177
Washington and
Roshambo can not beat me.

1644
01:59:28,213 --> 01:59:30,492
I'll wait for their frontal attack.

1645
01:59:47,676 --> 01:59:48,912
Well, what?

1646
01:59:48,948 --> 01:59:51,054
This is General La Fayette, sir.

1647
01:59:51,326 --> 01:59:53,453
La Fayette?!

1648
01:59:53,536 --> 01:59:55,413
Damn boy!

1649
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:59,751
Already here we are attacked?
What a smart one!

1650
02:00:00,168 --> 02:00:02,441
Maybe too smart!

1651
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:07,697
Hoping to drive us,
like a chicken from a perch.

1652
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:12,222
A will find a trap here.

1653
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:15,496
Fire!

1654
02:00:19,542 --> 02:00:20,919
Fire!

1655
02:01:13,556 --> 02:01:16,539
The situation of expensive
Phillips is complicated.

1656
02:01:16,575 --> 02:01:20,042
I hope he cope.

1657
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:35,183
Behind me! To battle!

1658
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,993
General La Fayette in a mousetrap!

1659
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:54,286
Go!

1660
02:02:06,945 --> 02:02:11,095
On right! A company of grenadiers!
To battle!

1661
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:44,213
This madman will break
his neck about my grenadiers.

1662
02:03:30,448 --> 02:03:34,098
Phillips killed his father La Fayette.

1663
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:38,060
It's a shame if she kills her son.

1664
02:03:58,957 --> 02:04:00,667
Washington!

1665
02:04:34,076 --> 02:04:37,121
Sorry, sir, but
Yorktown is 3 miles away!

1666
02:04:37,225 --> 02:04:40,395
- Order to speed up the step.
- "Speed up the pace!"

1667
02:04:40,729 --> 02:04:42,919
Accelerate the step!

1668
02:04:52,992 --> 02:04:54,848
Turn the gun!

1669
02:04:58,351 --> 02:05:01,000
Gentlemen of the English,
accept my compliments!

1670
02:05:12,929 --> 02:05:14,410
Damn boy!

1671
02:05:14,597 --> 02:05:16,725
From our guns!

1672
02:05:16,954 --> 02:05:19,003
Let's go to the shelter.

1673
02:05:19,039 --> 02:05:21,646
I have no desire to be killed.

1674
02:05:21,751 --> 02:05:24,295
Especially English cannons!

1675
02:05:33,283 --> 02:05:34,701
Fire!

1676
02:05:40,645 --> 02:05:42,053
Fire!

1677
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:46,985
Look!

1678
02:05:51,073 --> 02:05:53,971
French or English?
Their minimum is 30.

1679
02:05:59,456 --> 02:06:01,166
This is an English squadron.

1680
02:06:07,756 --> 02:06:08,883
Sir!

1681
02:06:13,137 --> 02:06:15,035
The French fleet!

1682
02:06:15,514 --> 02:06:18,851
Gentlemen, this is the
greatest day of the war!

1683
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:27,861
Yes it's de Grasse!

1684
02:06:31,573 --> 02:06:35,639
The French fleet!

1685
02:06:41,437 --> 02:06:43,257
Are they crazy?

1686
02:06:43,293 --> 02:06:44,842
This is the French squadron, sir.

1687
02:06:44,878 --> 02:06:48,132
French? And how many
ships do they have? Two? Three?

1688
02:06:48,168 --> 02:06:49,570
About 30, sir.

1689
02:06:49,737 --> 02:06:51,322
30?!

1690
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:58,601
Sir! General
Roshambo's army surrounds us.

1691
02:07:03,606 --> 02:07:05,149
Behind me, Rangers!

1692
02:07:33,387 --> 02:07:35,243
I will not see the sea.

1693
02:07:35,618 --> 02:07:38,559
Be of good cheer, Kalb!
The carriages will soon arrive.

1694
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:40,383
The orderlies!

1695
02:07:40,602 --> 02:07:44,127
There will never be a general Kalb.

1696
02:07:44,315 --> 02:07:47,464
Will be! Without us, we
would all be captured!

1697
02:07:47,985 --> 02:07:49,351
Got it?

1698
02:07:51,593 --> 02:07:54,763
You, who are so fond of freedom...

1699
02:07:55,681 --> 02:07:59,247
Marquis, I'll die
for this bitch too!

1700
02:07:59,288 --> 02:08:00,352
Yes, Kalb.

1701
02:08:01,666 --> 02:08:03,981
"You know that, do not you?"
Yes, Kalb.

1702
02:08:05,357 --> 02:08:08,068
Do not look at me anymore, Marquis.

1703
02:08:30,237 --> 02:08:32,323
Looks like this mousetrap...

1704
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:34,742
was set for me.

1705
02:08:38,975 --> 02:08:40,644
On the shoulder!

1706
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:53,574
Mission accomplished, Monsieur!

1707
02:08:56,493 --> 02:08:58,412
Weapons on the ground!

1708
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:15,929
My sword, sir.

1709
02:11:16,263 --> 02:11:19,558
Until now, she
only knew victories.

1710
02:11:19,594 --> 02:11:21,122
I know that, sir.

1711
02:11:21,372 --> 02:11:26,711
We and our allies
are very proud of this.

1712
02:11:28,213 --> 02:11:31,028
Military fortune is capricious.

1713
02:11:31,341 --> 02:11:34,136
You broke the English general,

1714
02:11:34,323 --> 02:11:38,161
and I congratulate you on that.
But the English army does not give up.

1715
02:11:38,197 --> 02:11:41,998
The English army has always
shown us an example of fortitude.

1716
02:11:42,144 --> 02:11:47,274
But you have to admit that
we in America follow your example.

1717
02:11:47,608 --> 02:11:49,407
As for me, I hope,

1718
02:11:49,443 --> 02:11:53,906
this victory will put an end
to this brutal and unjust war.

1719
02:12:11,925 --> 02:12:14,657
Can I ask you a favor, sir?

1720
02:12:14,782 --> 02:12:16,825
Of course. About what?

1721
02:12:17,847 --> 02:12:21,288
General La Fayette?
Something I do not see it.

1722
02:12:21,539 --> 02:12:24,917
He kept slipping
away from me all the time.

1723
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:27,315
Can I finally meet with him?

1724
02:12:27,352 --> 02:12:30,047
I think that this time...

1725
02:12:30,193 --> 02:12:32,633
he will wait for you.

1726
02:12:51,862 --> 02:12:55,324
I paid dearly for the
right to meet with you.

1727
02:12:55,678 --> 02:12:58,327
Can I ask you to
speak privately?

1728
02:12:58,363 --> 02:12:59,891
With pleasure, monsieur.

1729
02:12:59,953 --> 02:13:03,916
I always kept the hope of
receiving you in my tent.

1730
02:13:14,114 --> 02:13:17,096
I am always at my meetings, Mr.
La Fayette.

1731
02:13:17,133 --> 02:13:20,412
- Me too, sir.
- "Even on the unpleasant."

1732
02:13:20,871 --> 02:13:23,379
They made me run.

1733
02:13:23,415 --> 02:13:27,127
They undoubtedly
remembered how I love hunting.

1734
02:13:27,232 --> 02:13:31,653
Unfortunately,
as before, you killed.

1735
02:13:31,841 --> 02:13:34,072
You are to be congratulated.

1736
02:13:34,406 --> 02:13:35,537
Thank you sir.

1737
02:13:35,574 --> 02:13:40,641
But by the way, your success to a
large extent depended on my high command.

1738
02:13:40,892 --> 02:13:45,375
Lord Clinton will not let me win the battle
until he himself does not win at least one.

1739
02:13:45,813 --> 02:13:49,004
{\ a9} Then, probably, I
should congratulate you

1740
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:51,528
with the fact that you lost this one?

1741
02:13:51,861 --> 02:13:55,448
Not so long the general
to understand such things.

1742
02:13:55,485 --> 02:13:59,035
Our army has always been
the strongest, as you know.

1743
02:13:59,072 --> 02:14:01,121
Only ours - more deserved.

1744
02:14:02,143 --> 02:14:04,520
No one will argue
with you, I'm sure.

1745
02:14:05,625 --> 02:14:08,384
But you were alone
against General Washington,

1746
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:12,174
Count Roshambo, Count
de Grasse, Baron Vomenil...

1747
02:14:12,257 --> 02:14:13,738
And you!

1748
02:14:13,967 --> 02:14:17,179
Do not put yourself in the last place.

1749
02:14:17,325 --> 02:14:19,807
You were the most dangerous for us.

1750
02:14:19,994 --> 02:14:23,060
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1751
02:14:23,227 --> 02:14:24,687
Yes.

1752
02:14:25,125 --> 02:14:30,505
Please make sure that my soldiers, and
your prisoners, are treated like human beings.

1753
02:14:30,542 --> 02:14:32,591
You do not have to worry, sir.

1754
02:14:32,799 --> 02:14:37,613
Americans have been captured
for too long to abuse others badly.

1755
02:14:39,619 --> 02:14:43,039
Let me have one more word, sir.

1756
02:14:44,687 --> 02:14:47,252
Your army was not the strongest.

1757
02:14:47,794 --> 02:14:53,064
The strength of the army is not in
numbers, but in the case that it defends.

1758
02:15:07,281 --> 02:15:11,485
The war was not over yet, but the battle
at Yorktown turned out to be decisive.

1759
02:15:11,652 --> 02:15:13,717
The path to victory was opened.

1760
02:15:13,863 --> 02:15:17,074
And La Fayette could keep the way
to France with an easy heart.

1761
02:15:17,158 --> 02:15:19,848
Now, Mr. Marquis,
we are parting.

1762
02:15:20,265 --> 02:15:22,622
Victory brings and parting.

1763
02:15:22,768 --> 02:15:25,312
Nothing can separate the
front-line comrades.

1764
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,129
Your wife, your children, your friends...

1765
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:32,736
and glory... A lot of you are waiting.

1766
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:35,197
And most importantly - France.

1767
02:15:36,073 --> 02:15:38,722
The uniform will change, but not the case.

1768
02:15:39,201 --> 02:15:41,600
The Lord made it so that
you were born a Marquis.

1769
02:15:41,704 --> 02:15:45,437
But each of us will
remember that freedom

1770
02:15:45,625 --> 02:15:46,980
was born Frenchwoman.

1771
02:15:47,043 --> 02:15:49,587
But she was taught to walk by America.

1772
02:15:49,671 --> 02:15:52,361
Without you, I would remain
an officer - a troublemaker,

1773
02:15:52,403 --> 02:15:54,905
a talker from a tavern.

1774
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:58,450
Congress made me a general,
you are a soldier.

1775
02:16:01,036 --> 02:16:03,904
I hope you will come
back to us someday.

1776
02:16:05,187 --> 02:16:07,501
Yes. And perhaps the
ambassador of the new France.

1777
02:16:07,585 --> 02:16:09,034
Maybe.

1778
02:16:09,483 --> 02:16:12,152
But when? And will I still be here?

1779
02:16:15,593 --> 02:16:17,387
Farewell, son.

1780
02:16:18,096 --> 02:16:19,556
Good-bye, monsieur.

1781
02:16:26,125 --> 02:16:27,626
God bless you!

1782
02:16:27,710 --> 02:16:29,274
Thank you sir.

1783
02:16:29,712 --> 02:16:30,963
Thank you!

1784
02:16:50,275 --> 02:16:52,110
Damn the boy!

1785
02:16:57,895 --> 02:17:01,682
<i>"I'm waiting for you.
You will return, I know.</i>

1786
02:17:01,808 --> 02:17:05,874
<i>But only when America's
independence is securely secured. "</i>

1787
02:17:05,958 --> 02:17:08,523
It is done, beloved.
Independence is assured.

1788
02:17:08,669 --> 02:17:11,130
Mankind has won this process.

1789
02:17:11,234 --> 02:17:14,404
Freedom now has a
refuge on Earth.
