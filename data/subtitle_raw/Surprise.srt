1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,960
(Laughing)

2
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Hows the writing going?

3
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,840
I can't escape it.

4
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,200
The ghosts of my former self come back to haunt me.

5
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
They follow me, as I write in peace

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,320
with the backdrop of so much pain...

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,960
Your'e one of the greatest

8
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,040
horror writers of our time.

9
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
... I was.

10
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,360
I have a new story to tell the world...

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,200
But even my ghost’s cast shadows.

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Our Father, who art in heaven

13
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,600
hallowed be thy name

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,680
thy kingdom come

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,800
thy will be done in earth

16
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
as it is in heaven.

17
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
Give us this our daily bread

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
And forgive us our trespasses

19
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,480
as we forgive them what trespass against us

20
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,200
And lead us not into temptation

21
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,160
but deliver us from evil

22
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,480
For thine is the kingdom

23
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,840
the power and the glory

24
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,520
forever and ever

25
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Amen

26
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,840
Still a believer?

27
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,640
A man of faith cannot be a rational man...

28
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,080
You’ve had an early start to the day

29
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Too early

30
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
as they say.

31
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
And you come all this way

32
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
just for me?

33
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,760
I’ve been walking by your side for quite sometime.

34
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,120
You must be exhausted.

35
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,600
Of all the places you thought of to hide from me

36
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
You are no recluse

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,960
even when in the company of strangers.

38
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,960
I thought I was familiar with this place.

39
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
But people move on

40
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,280
And boy, have you tried.

41
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,040
Shall this be over soon?

42
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,040
Am i to be silenced before i speak?

43
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
I’ve made a few amendments.

44
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,080
If I cannot inspire love

45
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
I will create fear.

46
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,080
and im far better at my job

47
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
than you are

48
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,880
I try to inspire people

49
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,600
how?

50
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,440
when you can’t even inspire yourself?

51
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Your in my story now

52
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
and these

53
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,600

54
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,240
there all mine now...

55
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,080
(laughing)

56
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,640
You a member?

57
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Ahh of course..

58
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Ten pound love

59
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Thanks Dad!

60
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360

61
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,160

They got wine on tap.

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,240
Homey isnt exactly the word id use to discribe it

116
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Speaking of which does any one want a drink?

117
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,880
Still time for ones pleasantries

118
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
before the others arrive.

119
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,440
How many are expected?

120
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,080

121
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,440

135
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,240

we didn't know how many people would be here?

300
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880

322
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680

323
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,480

324
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,680

326
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,520

327
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
The film that

328
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,960
i want to put forward this evening is erm

329
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,040
Its not really the style

330
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,240
i want to be remembered for making

331
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
i was very proud of it

332
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
at one point.

333
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,280
So what are you hoping to catch today then?

334
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
A shark.

335
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
A shark?

336
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,600
I don't think your nets big enough for a shark.

337
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm gonna put it back silly.

338
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Ahh well of course.

339
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
Besides

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,640
daddy hasn't got enough room

341
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,440
in his freezer for a full shark i don't think.

342
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,320
Why would you put a shark in the freezer?

343
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,800
we can put it in the fishtank with George.

344
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,120

390
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,920
hanging up on the wall in the office.

391
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,800

We need to talk.

417
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,720
In situations like this

418
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,560

419
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,720

Lou

422
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,640
You never take anything serious.

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Her name

432
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
is Penny.

433
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,680

434
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
We went for a drink.

Everything was fine we'd you know we'd

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,880
i did the gentlemanly thing i tried to call her.

451
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,280
Call her a few time actually.

452
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
She never picked up my calls.

453
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Not seen anything of her

454
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
she disapeared.

455
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Untill now.

00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Correct.

457
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,400

No.

463
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm scared my wife will find out.

464
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Ahh.

465
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Yeah.

468
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Your'e in trouble.

469
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,480
You forgot to fix the washer.

470
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,600
Jesus.

471
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,320

473
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,520
This for you being home from the gym?

474
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,640
Again.

475
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,760
I'm sorry love but something came up at work.

476
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,480
I thought you was off this week?

477
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,000
So did I.

478
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,880
Oh poor you.

479
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
I know what you want.

480
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,200
That new place down the road.

481
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,360
Lets have a lovely evening dinner down there..

482
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
A bit tired are we?

485
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Late night?

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,800

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,800
I still have to be at the Hospital in an hour.

491
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,800
There's pizza in the fridge

492

493
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920

Ehh?

502
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,920
Robert.

503
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
You know this one as well?

504
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
When did you last see her?

505
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Yesterday.

506
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Yesterday?

507
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,360
The nurses outfit is this any

508
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,880
significance?

509
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
(Phone ringing)

510
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
My brother comes here.

511
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,240
Sorry love theres been an incedent at the gym.

512
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
What's going on mate?

513
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,800
There's about to be one at home to.

514
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,600
You not working tonight honey?

515
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,200
What are we going to do to you?

516
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,600
That's a rhetorical question

517
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
I'm really not expecting an answer.

518
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,080
It will take hours for that substance to wear off.

519
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
And by that time

520
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
I'll be the only one here.

521
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,880
Well i don't know.

522
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,240
You start off trying to conquer the world

523
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,280
and you end up six feet under it.

524
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
You've

525
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,600
been a very bad boy

526
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Mr Faraday.

527
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Be mine?

528
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Well.

529
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,120
We tried that didn't we?

530
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Guess who?

531
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,080
I wonder who that could possibly be?

532
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,120
The girl at the bar?

533
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Maybe?

534
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
or

535
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,080
the girl at the gym?

536
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,200
Your Fucked.

537
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Mr Tinder.

538
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Is he still alive?

539
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,400
Depends on what you class as alive?

540
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,720
A see the knifes came in handy.

541
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,880
How many goes did you have at him?

542
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,320
Evidently not enough.

543
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Daddy what a pop?

544
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,680
mmm no

545
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll deal with the aftermath.

546
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,760
Did it make you sad Robert?

547
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,600
Knowing

548
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,040
that every year

549
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,640
from this date forward

550
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
I'll have your disapearance

551
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
to remember.

552
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,080
You was always to good for him.

553
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,600
You've got mail!!

554
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,080
Expecting it to rain, are we?

555
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,200
It's very peculiar here.

556
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,520
You’ve just figured that out.

557
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,480
Could i just have a water please?

558
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,520
I'm alright thanks.

559
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What's that smell?

560
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
They had samples in the toilet.

561
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Fuckin sunblock?

562
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
It's moisturiser.

563
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,040
I think I know what sun cream smells like.

564
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,080
Don’t be fooled by this pigment

565
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,240
It's the middle of fucking autumn.

566
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Ahhh.

567
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,800
Here take a fresh one.

568
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,200
I'm sorry about that.

569
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,520
No don't worry about it.

570
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,040
I do apologise.

571
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
It’s fine, just a small cut.

572
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,600
What happened?

573
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,640
I’m fine, really.

574
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,080
Just a bit of a shock that's all.

575
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Well

576
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,560
back to the main narrative of this evening then.

577
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,560
Care to invest a tale to this event Laura?

578
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,520
So anyway erm.

579
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,640
when you had it off with Denzel Washington right.

580
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,360
Come on hurry up and take the fuckin picture

581
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
Yeah of course.

582
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
You get there time in a minute.

583
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,560
Collecting flies the poor las.

584
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,240
Make her look pretty.

585
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
Alright sweetheart.

586
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Here we go.

587
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,920
Chuck us a big smile.

588
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Erm?

589
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
Can we try.

590
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Just smile with your eyes.

591
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Okay.

592
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
Just smile with your eyes

593
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,040
That's better.

594
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
Oh that's better.

595
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Huhh..

596
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,280
Tacete! Canes!

597
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
What?

598
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,040
Shut up! You fuckin dogs!

599
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,120
You speak Latin?

600
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,600
Only when it’s convenient, apparently

601
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,720
And you thought

602
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
now

603
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
to be that time?

604
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,560
A dead language.

605
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,560
Reflecting what?

606
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
Your career?

607
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Your anxiety?

608
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
Humour me.

609
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,360
They say you only die twice.

610
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
Once when your body fails and

611
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
twice when

612
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,880
your names spoken to for the last time

613
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,000
And in what order will that benefit you?

614
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,560
You have aspirations

615
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,280
on what you want to accomplish in this life.

616
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
Correct?

617
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,280
So why is it?

618
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,280
That this shoot

619
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,560
is dramatically put on hold

620
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,160
because you cannot keep your tongue pressed

621
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,720
firmly against those teeth?

622
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,800
Well your photographer...

623
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,080
One takes a picture of a rose,

624
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,760
regardless of the equipment or the skill

625
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
behind it.

626
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,240
It is still a rose.

627
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,040
Correct?

628
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
I’m sorry if I’ve insulted you in some way.

629
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
I just wanted some...

630
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,680
direction.

631
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
professionalism...

632
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
Direction?

633
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,680
Professionalism?

634
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,920
Mannequin?

635
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,240
Do you know what a mannequin is?

636
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,360
Yeah.

637
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,960
Mannequin does not talk,

638
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,160
you see, a mannequin

639
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,040
is a blank canvas

640
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,040
that one can showcase clothing

641
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,000
You are here to sell the items you are wearing,

642
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,120
not what is underneath them.

643
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,440
It doesn’t matter who we get,

644
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,520
the clothing sells itself.

645
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,720
A mannequin is for display purposes only,

646
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,880
you bring as much to this shoot

647
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
as a fucking clothes-horse.

648
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,080
You stop to ask for direction?

649
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,920
Can I ask you a question real quick?

650
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,760
Am I telling you how to do your job,

651
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,800
or are you telling me how to do mine?

652
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,280
Because we’re not doing the latter

653
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,160
ON MY FUCKING TIME!!!

654
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,600
Here

655
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,200
take one for the road.

656
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,280
Now get the fuck out of my studio.

657
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Do i know you?

658
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,080
It's possible we met once before.

659
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,760
But.

660
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,600
as you've no recolletion.

661
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,720
Then collectively..

662
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,080
no.

663
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,560
Well you obviously

664
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,920
didn’t leave a good enough impression

665
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
did you.

666
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,440
We never do.

667
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,320
Come around.

668
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,760
I knew you’d be here

669
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,240
What would you do if I wasn’t?

670
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,680
Wait, you’d come eventually

671
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,120
I didn’t want to be alone tonight

672
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,280
But you are.

673
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,320
Let's begin

674
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,320
Don't shut it out.

675
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
Let it in.

676
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,840
Let if feed on your darkest thoughts,

677
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,920
and desires.

678
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,560
Your hatred.

679
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,720
It is bound to you,

680
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,200
as you are to it.

681
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
Come

682
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
let it out.

683
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,640
Let it breath

684
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,640
yes ..having to entertain these fucking models

685
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,640
your sending me.

686
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,600
Amateurs

687
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,160
all thinking they’re going to be the next Cara...

688
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,360
They'll only be good enough for toilet selfies

689
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,360
when i'm done with them.

690
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Gumtree!

691
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,320
You insult me with Gumtree!

692
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,360
calling themselfs freelancers

693
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,360
They haven't even got the decency

694
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,840
to come through a proper agency.

695
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,440
I don't give a fuck who they

696
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,640
advertise themselfs as.

697
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,720
It's just Craigslist without the STI.

698
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,680
I know I know

699
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,680
just being facetious

700
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
Yep

701
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,000
Yep I got the delivery.

702
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,320
Yep.

703
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,920
Fucking Yank.

704
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,680
Tacete!

705
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,800
The last your name will be spoken.

706
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,120
Byron.

707
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,160
A warm welcome ladies and gentlemen

708
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,880
to The Old Familiar.

709
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,520
For a very special evening.

710
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,520
My names Archie.

711
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,800
I'm your announcer and your Bouncer

712
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,440
You can heckel but i'll kick your teeth in.

713
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,520
Hello.

714
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,720
Hello sweetheart.

715
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,520
Hello Shania.

716
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,360
I've shagged her.

717
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,000
Let herself go a little bit.

718
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Haven't we all?

719
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,840
And now without further ado

720
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,840
Sorry i missed this one.

721
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,600
Each writer is going to come up

722
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,840
display his talents for you.

723
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,160
Please.

724
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,840
Show your appreciation to them.

725
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,600
We'll get on with the evening.

726
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,040
So...HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!

727
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,240
What you doing man?

728
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,480
What was that?

729
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
(laughing)

730
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Relax.

731
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,440
Are screams not the soundtrack of halloween?

732
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,280
The very ambience of this evening?

733
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,800
They are merely gunshots to bonfire night.

734
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,760
The sounds that dwell

735
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,640
in familiarity of darkness.

736
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,960
Excactly.

737
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,920
So don't be scared Laura.

738
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,120
You won't feel a thing.

739
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,160
I promise you.

740
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,320
You see

741
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,280
I am really the ONLY writer in attendance

742
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
this evening.

743
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,160
You are my

744
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,320
my characters

745
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
my puppets

746
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,560
my pawns.

747
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,800
For me to do with what ever i wil.

748
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,760
Your not here to tell your stories.

749
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,520
YOU ARE THE STORIES.

750
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,400
SURPRISE!!!!

751
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,400
HAHAHAHA!!
