1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,040
When the lamb opened the sixth seal,
there was a great earthquake.

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,999
The sun turned black like sackcloth.

3
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:39,707
The whole moon turned blood red.
The stars in the sky fell to earth, -

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,374
- as figs drop from a fig tree
when shaken by a strong wind.

5
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:57,874
PEOPLE IN THE SUN

6
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,540
-For you, my love.
-Oh, thank you!

7
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,249
-Svein, why do you never do that?
-Do what?

8
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,874
-You never give me roses anymore.
-Anymore?

9
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,082
I've never given you roses.

10
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,457
Are we going to the beach, or not?

11
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,207
This looks like a good spot.

12
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,582
Svein?

13
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,707
Svein!
Careful you don't have a heart attack.

14
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,707
Are you out of your mind?

15
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,540
-Come on, give me a kiss.
-Cut it out! This is a public beach!

16
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,332
Didn't you shave?

17
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,082
You look like a monkey.

18
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,957
I didn't have time.

19
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,082
Really?
You're on vacation, aren't you?

20
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,540
Stig, look at this lovely weather!

21
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,415
Don't you agree that it's lovely?

22
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,332
I told you to book early
to get the best view.

23
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,665
-I know, I'm sorry. My mistake.
-Yes.

24
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,624
-Candy?
-Yes, please.

25
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,165
God, this feels good!

26
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,749
-Can you feel the sun burning?
-Yeah.

27
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,249
It's probably the greenhouse effect.

28
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,582
I'm not sure I'm against that.

29
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:25,249
If you rent a cabin for two weeks,
you want the weather to be hot, right?

30
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,707
In 2000 years
everything will be desert anyway.

31
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,249
I used factor 12,
so I can lie here for 12 hours.

32
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,374
With all that hair,
you don't need sunscreen.

33
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,790
True.

34
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,874
-Ingrid, don't sing.
-Sorry.

35
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,915
-Can we go to that Midsummer party?
-Someone was mugged again.

36
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,624
-Where?
-In town.

37
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:12,582
"A gang of kids
beat a 35-year-old man unconscious."

38
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,749
-Why do you read things like that?
-"They stomped on his head."

39
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,915
"He is still in a coma."
Well, there you go.

40
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,040
I wonder...

41
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,374
I wonder what their brains look like.

42
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:33,040
I mean, stomping on the head
of someone you don't even know?

43
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:39,790
-Would it help if they knew them?
-I could at least understand that.

44
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,457
-Fucking view.
-I know. I'm sorry.

45
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,582
Stig?
I'm sorry!

46
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,582
-Hey.
-What?

47
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:44,999
This doctor said it's OK
for white people to lay in the sun, -

48
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,832
- but only for half an hour a day,
or they'll die.

49
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:54,499
A half-hour in the sun,
after last winter? We'd die anyway!

50
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,832
Only Negroes should live in
Scandinavia. They can handle the sun.

51
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,707
We whites can't handle anything.

52
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,457
Christ!
What the hell?

53
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,332
What's that?
A fish?

54
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:14,499
Look, Simon has caught a fish.
He has a disgusting fish...

55
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,790
What are you going to call it?

56
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,915
Nemo, maybe?

57
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,665
Didn't you like
that Nemo movie, Simon?

58
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,290
Didn't they tell us
he liked that Nemo movie, Svein?

59
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,665
Simon, who do you love more?

60
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,749
Mommy or daddy?

61
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:42,665
Mom comes first, then dad, right?

62
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,957
Come on.
Give mommy a kiss, Simon.

63
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,874
Yech!
What's that in your nose?

64
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,499
A booger! God, that's gross!
Get rid of it!

65
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,832
Did you get rid of it?
Is it gone?

66
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,040
Where did you put it?
In your mouth?

67
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:09,499
Gross! I can't deal with this.
Don't kiss mommy. Kiss daddy instead.

68
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,082
I feel nauseous.

69
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,874
-When's the bus leaving?
-There's still time.

70
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,707
Stig, everyone's leaving
for the party!

71
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,249
Stig!

72
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,332
Ingrid?

73
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,207
Beach tennis?

74
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,790
This will be fun!
It isn't stupid at all.

75
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,165
-It's a blast! Come on.
-But I'm no good at it.

76
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,749
-This is a good spot.
-I'm no good at ball games.

77
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:12,207
-Take this. Don't be silly.
-I don't know how to play.

78
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,582
Nonsense. It doesn't matter
if you're good or bad.

79
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,665
-Don't get mad.
-I won't.

80
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,540
-This is about having fun!
-Just don't get mad.

81
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,915
-I won't get mad.
-You will get mad.

82
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,874
-I won't!
-Now you're mad.

83
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,207
-Christ!
-I'm sorry!

84
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,999
Just shut up, you stupid cow!

85
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,999
Jesus!

86
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,290
Stig!

87
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,165
I apologize.

88
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,707
Stig!

89
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,999
Cut that out!

90
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,874
Stop it.
Fix the radio instead.

91
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:16,332
-It's probably just the batteries.
-We got new ones yesterday.

92
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:20,874
Maybe it's that knob?
That one, back there?

93
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,040
-Fix it!
-We can enjoy ourselves in other ways.

94
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,665
We're on a public beach!

95
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,999
Stop...

96
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,290
-Simon's right there!
-Hi, Simon. What's up?

97
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,499
Why don't you go buy some ice cream?
Here's some money.

98
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,707
-Off you go!
-No, Simon.

99
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:54,165
-Have you lost your mind?
-Christ! Please, Siv!

100
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,582
The therapist said that we...
That we need to try. Right?

101
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,040
Svein?

102
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,915
What are you doing?

103
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,207
I'm being erotic.

104
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,665
This is...new, Svein.

105
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,999
It's just you and me.
And the sea.

106
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,082
Stig!

107
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,707
-Hi.
-You coming to the dance?

108
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:52,082
-No, I'm looking for my husband.
-This is the last bus. Join us!

109
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,665
It would have been nice, but...

110
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,415
-OK. Have fun.
-You, too.

111
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,124
-Anything else before we close?
-No, thank you.

112
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:36,624
Stig?

113
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:43,165
Stig!

114
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:02,290
I'm sorry! I didn't see anything.
I didn't think anyone was here.

115
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,082
I'm looking for my husband.
Stig.

116
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,874
Have you seen him?
He's about this tall.

117
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,332
-Have you seen him?
-No.

118
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:17,082
-You're Norwegian too?
-Yes, there are a few here.

119
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,332
You renting, or camping?

120
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:24,040
We're renting a cabin.
Maybe we're neighbors.

121
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,915
We've been here many times.
I'm not really sure why.

122
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:33,499
But you have to do something
during summer vacation.

123
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,915
I teach primary school.

124
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,415
-And your husband?
-He's a professor.

125
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,249
-Interesting. What does he teach?
-Psychology.

126
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,665
There he is!
Stig!

127
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,832
I'm sorry I shouted!
Stig says my voice is so ugly.

128
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,332
-Stig, look what I found.
-Hello.

129
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,165
-Svein.
-Stig.

130
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,082
-We also have a cabin.
-Which one?

131
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,957
The one with the gorgeous view.

132
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,332
-So you're in our cabin.
-That's the one we always rent.

133
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,499
But I forgot to book it.
I'm sorry.

134
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,749
Well, better luck next time.

135
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:23,040
It doesn't matter where we live.
We're outdoors all day, anyway.

136
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,665
So we can take your cabin?

137
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,790
-Do you come to the beach much?
-Oh, yes.

138
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,332
-There are lots of flies.
-That's true.

139
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,374
-But it's nice and warm.
-In the sun.

140
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,999
That's true.

141
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,665
Yeah.

142
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,499
Right, Stig? Stig is very concerned
about climate change.

143
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,124
-Global warming.
-That's what I told Svein.

144
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:56,915
I'm not sure it's a bad thing.
We like warm weather.

145
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,249
The end of the world is near, and all
the ladies worry about is getting tan!

146
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:07,040
Look, there's Simon
with his ice cream!

147
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,499
Can mommy have a taste?

148
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,540
-Simon. Mommy's little darling.
-Hi. Ingrid.

149
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,832
-This is Stig.
-Hi, I'm Stig.

150
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:21,749
Let mommy have a taste.
We paid for it!

151
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,832
Give me a break, Simon!

152
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,374
Fine, then say please.

153
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,540
Say please!

154
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,915
He's a quiet bastard.

155
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,915
He actually hasn't said a word
in three years.

156
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,874
He's not retarded,
he just doesn't talk.

157
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,790
You're not stupid, are you?
Just on the quiet side?

158
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,082
Fine.
Take it.

159
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:51,957
He's a wise boy. People are full
of shit, anyway. Isn't that right?

160
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:57,290
Would you like to play beach tennis
with Uncle Stig?

161
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:09,749
It's Midsummer Eve, and since
we have a nice view and you don't...

162
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:15,707
Why don't you bring some food
and celebrate the evening with us?

163
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,582
-Want to?
-Sure.

164
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,124
-We have to eat, anyway.
-Great!

165
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:27,790
Six o'clock, sharp.
Make sure everybody "cums" on time.

166
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,540
Get it?

167
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,665
-Svein...
-I said "cum".

168
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,582
-Svein...
-It was a joke.

169
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,749
There sure are lots of flies here.

170
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,957
-You got it, right?
-What?

171
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,124
The joke.
"Cum" on time?

172
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,749
I'm so slow on the uptake.

173
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,540
See you.
Stig!

174
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,040
Great.
Cum as you are!

175
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:07,874
-What the hell did you do that for?
-It'll be fun. Trust me.

176
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:13,457
-Simon? Where is Simon?
-Probably playing somewhere.

177
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,457
Simon?

178
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,499
-Do we have everything we need?
-I'm sure we do.

179
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:27,040
-Do we have parsley?
-Do we really need parsley?

180
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:31,915
-Maybe there's parsley at the store.
-Don't make a fuss.

181
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,040
Remember to hang up the towels
when we get back.

182
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,874
Hi there.

183
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,082
Hi.

184
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,665
You eating wild strawberries?

185
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,790
I'm not sure they're ripe yet.
You don't want a tummyache, do you?

186
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,749
Where are mommy and daddy?

187
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,957
Are you lost?

188
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,457
You don't know where you are!
Here. Uncle Stig will help you.

189
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,582
Look at this.
Here is...

190
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,290
Here's Europe.
And tiny Norway.

191
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,832
And across the border is Sweden.
Where we are.

192
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,832
So now you can run on home!

193
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,749
"You can't have my swim ring!"

194
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,415
You sure don't talk much!

195
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,290
Well, you're probably better off.

196
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:09,374
This was fun!
Here, have some candy. Go on!

197
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,582
Have some candy!

198
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,582
-Is a storm on its way?
-There isn't a cloud in the sky.

199
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,582
Right.
Never mind.

200
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,749
Do you have parsley?
Fresh parsley?

201
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,874
Parsley?
Sure.

202
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,790
There aren't many people here tonight,
so it will probably be...quiet.

203
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,457
Would you like anything else?

204
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,790
Ouch!

205
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,999
CLOSED

206
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,665
-Hi, Stig.
-Hi.

207
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,582
Some view, isn't it?

208
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,499
Stig, check out the view!

209
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,332
-Stig?
-Fucking view!

210
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,457
I'm sorry.

211
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,540
-Have you seen Simon?
-No.

212
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,499
-Darling, look at this.
-Is it Simon?

213
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,374
Look!
The sea!

214
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,499
What?
What about it?

215
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:43,332
It's the sea. It makes you
feel so small. And humble.

216
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,082
Simon?

217
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,874
-Simon?
-Siv, look at the sea.

218
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,707
The view.
All the blueness.

219
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,165
-I feel like painting.
-You can't paint.

220
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,624
-I'd like to.
-No, you wouldn't.

221
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,457
-No, maybe not, but...
-Simon?

222
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:05,499
-There must be something I'd like to do.
-Look at postcards?

223
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:09,249
-Yeah. With pictures of the sea.
-Right. Simon?

224
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,832
There you are.
Be careful not to fall down.

225
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:24,207
Siv, if I just swam
straight out here...

226
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,707
-You can't even swim.
-Just imagine!

227
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:33,082
You cheated to get your swim badge.
You walked on the bottom.

228
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,749
-But still...
-Did you hang up those towels?

229
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,665
-I haven't had time.
-Haven't had time?

230
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,374
Were you planning on letting them
marinate in the bag until tomorrow?

231
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,249
Come on, Siv!

232
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:54,165
-Relax. We're on vacation!
-You might be!

233
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,124
Should we bring some food?

234
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:05,790
We could bring a melon
and the bread rolls.

235
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,999
That Svein is quite a flirt,
have you noticed?

236
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,707
Stig!

237
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,624
Stig?

238
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,290
Simon, come here.

239
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:50,957
Simon, what do you think
if daddy swam straight out here?

240
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,957
Where do you think I'd end up?
Scotland?

241
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,124
America, maybe!

242
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,582
I don't know, either.

243
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:02,290
Simon, are you still wearing
that swim ring?

244
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:08,207
There's no risk of drowning
here on shore, so you can take it off.

245
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,124
-Talk to him, Svein.
-Simon, take it...

246
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:17,040
-Just let him wear it.
-He's had it on since we got here.

247
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:21,332
Sometimes it feels like
he's drifting away from us.

248
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:25,957
He's going to be with us 24/7
for the next four weeks.

249
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,457
-It isn't our fault he's like this.
-I know! It's nobody's fault!

250
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:38,582
I just want him to take off that ring
because it looks so damned idiotic!

251
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,207
Siv.

252
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:45,290
-Siv...
-Never mind!

253
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,874
What is it?

254
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,665
Your eye is drooping.

255
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,290
Drooping?

256
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,332
Don't say it's drooping!
Is it drooping a lot?

257
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:16,457
-You should see a doctor.
-There aren't any doctors here.

258
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,415
There aren't any doctors here!

259
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,499
Fine.
Let it droop.

260
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:37,165
Svein? Isn't it weird that
that cabin isn't in use?

261
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,540
-Maybe someone will come next week.
-Do we have everything we need?

262
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:47,082
Melon, ham, sausages, shrimp...

263
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,957
-Are you wearing that?
-What do you mean?

264
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,707
That!

265
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:59,249
There's hair sticking out everywhere!

266
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,207
If only some of that hair
was on your head.

267
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,499
-Hi! Welcome.
-Thank you!

268
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,749
What an amazing spread!

269
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:16,665
We didn't have a lot.
Just a melon and some bread rolls.

270
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:22,457
-Are you on your own?
-No, Stig's...there!

271
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,832
Look at this spread!

272
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,582
-Welcome!
-Thanks.

273
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:35,665
-He's so incredibly cute.
-Thank you.

274
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,665
-Simon, would you like some melon?
-No, he wouldn't.

275
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,624
He hates it.

276
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:49,040
Have a seat! I gave you the view,
since you don't have one of your own.

277
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:56,332
Let me propose a toast.
There's schnapps for everyone.

278
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,957
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

279
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,582
Svein, 16.

280
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,790
What do you mean by that?

281
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:08,957
We always say how old we are,
when we were born, stuff like that.

282
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,290
I thought we could reveal
when we had our sexual debut.

283
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,915
We need an ice-breaker.
It'll be fun!

284
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:20,499
Come on, let's toast.
Svein, 16.

285
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,374
Cheers!

286
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,874
You're next, Siv.

287
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,832
Siv, 18.

288
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,540
Really?
That was late!

289
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:37,415
-Stig, go ahead.
-Stig. Cheers.

290
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,207
Stig, you party pooper!

291
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,415
Ingrid, your turn.

292
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,249
Ingrid, 14.

293
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,124
-Christ!
-That early? How did that come about?

294
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,290
I was raped.

295
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:06,457
Well, shit happens.
All right, let's sit down.

296
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,832
-Maybe we shouldn't do this.
-No, it's fine.

297
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:15,290
She says it's fine. Sit down.
We can handle this.

298
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,707
-I remember Midsummer as a child.
-Really?

299
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,165
Dad was always drunk
and mom always cried.

300
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,874
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

301
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:32,540
-Anyone know any summer songs?
-No, no.

302
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:35,415
-I know one.
-Let's hear it.

303
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,832
Ingrid...
Don't sing.

304
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:51,915
-Did I sing out of tune?
-No, it was great!

305
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,582
-I'm sorry.
-Don't bite your fingernails.

306
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:58,374
-Christ!
-She does it constantly.

307
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:03,249
She always does it in public.
Doing it in your room is fine, -

308
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:08,457
- but in the company of others,
you must realize it looks idiotic?

309
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,040
-Sorry, I do it all the time.
-It's OK, Inger.

310
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:17,624
- Ingrid.
-That's what I said. Inger...id.

311
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:21,457
-Cheers, everybody.
-Cheers.

312
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:27,415
Do any of you have any hobbies?

313
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,499
Mine are smoking and tanning.
Both give you cancer.

314
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,082
Just my luck.

315
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,665
I gave up smoking.

316
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,790
But I keep thinking
about starting up again.

317
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:50,832
Especially if something bad happens,
like Stig dying.

318
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,874
-But I can't hope for that.
-Why not?

319
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,832
Yeah, why not!

320
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:06,374
I'm sorry. I apologize, Stig.
I don't know what came over me.

321
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,665
Dig in before the flies do!

322
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,040
-Is that bread fresh?
-Yes, sir.

323
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:16,374
-Stig, no white bread for you.
-One slice is OK.

324
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:22,915
He's on a gluten-free diet.
White bread makes him angry.

325
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,999
I've never heard of that before.
Anyway, help yourselves.

326
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:33,499
-Maybe this was a bad idea?
-No, it'll be fun.

327
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:39,249
Nothing will happen. Trust me,
I know what I'm talking about.

328
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,415
-What was that?
-Nothing. Eat!

329
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,790
-Maybe they need help?
-No one here needs help.

330
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,457
Help!

331
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,957
-There's someone there.
-Just eat.

332
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:57,665
-Don't look at me, I don't work here.
-Button your shirt.

333
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,957
-Can someone help me?
-Crap, she's Danish.

334
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,124
Hello!

335
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,582
-See what it is, Svein.
-Why me?

336
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,499
-Because you're a man!
-Of course.

337
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:16,415
Hello?

338
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,915
-Finally!
-We thought we heard something.

339
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:27,332
-The reception is closed.
-They closed early today.

340
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:33,249
That's OK. I'm staying in Cabin 11.
Do you know where it is?

341
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,582
-You are very kind.
-My pleasure.

342
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:43,832
-They're quite heavy. Need help?
-No, I'm fine.

343
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:58,582
Would you like a caramel?

344
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,374
Simon doesn't accept candy
from strangers.

345
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:06,749
Of course not.
How silly of me.

346
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:11,124
Svein, what's that old hag doing here?

347
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:16,415
I'm staying in number 11.
We're neighbors. Won't that be nice?

348
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,124
I'll just lift -

349
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:31,582
- these suitcases onto my terrace.

350
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:37,290
Please keep eating.
My name is Mrs. Sorensen.

351
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,124
It's strange -

352
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,040
- that they weren't waiting for me
at the reception.

353
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,707
They knew I was coming.

354
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,165
They must have been busy.

355
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,874
OK...

356
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,915
Here I am.

357
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:08,915
With a locked cabin and no key.

358
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:13,165
-Don't you have a key?
-No, but that's OK.

359
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:19,290
The reception will open in the morning.
It's warm out, so I'll be fine.

360
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:30,165
-You going to sit there all night?
-What?

361
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:36,582
-Are you going to sit there all night?
-Yes, I'm fine.

362
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:44,957
30%% of all people get cancer
at some point in their life.

363
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,540
-Should we invite her over?
-Why?

364
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,207
It isn't our fault she has cancer.

365
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,874
Please dig in.
We have salmon, shrimp, ham...

366
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:04,499
-I'd love some salmon.
-I told you this would be nice!

367
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,165
-Cheers, everybody.
-Cheers!

368
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,207
Svein, 16.

369
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:14,332
Isn't it incredible how the sun
is shining, even though it's so late?

370
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:19,582
-Isn't it lovely?
-Yes, the sun is wonderful.

371
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:25,165
I read in the paper that a man was
scorched to death lying in the sun.

372
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,707
It's true.
He was actually fried to death.

373
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:36,832
Please eat!
Don't let me disturb you. Eat!

374
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:43,415
-Why don't we invite her over?
-No way!

375
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,082
She can buy her own life,
like everyone else.

376
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:52,040
Some people
simply lack social antennas.

377
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,124
This is the Midsummer from hell!

378
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,124
Simon, come eat!
Come on.

379
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,624
Come and eat, Simon!

380
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:04,290
My love, he isn't a dog.

381
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,332
Here.

382
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,874
You look so nice.

383
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,915
Families are a great thing.

384
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,749
But I'm sure it's very demanding
to have children.

385
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:27,790
Simon doesn't live at home
during the school year.

386
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,999
We couldn't handle
that responsibility.

387
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,124
But he's with us every weekend.

388
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:46,457
Help yourselves!
We have ham here, too.

389
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,290
Go easy on the shrimp, Simon.

390
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,915
Simon, easy on the shrimp.
Put some back.

391
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,624
I said no more shrimp!
You'll get a tummyache.

392
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:06,999
Mommy wants to party and have fun
for once, not take care of you!

393
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,249
Do as mommy says.

394
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:15,249
Don't put all of them back!
You have to eat!

395
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:19,374
-Svein, do something!
-Do as mommy says.

396
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:23,832
It's hotter out now
than it was at midday.

397
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:29,040
And take off that swim ring!
You can't eat with...

398
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:33,499
Take it off, dammit!
Let me pull it over your head.

399
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,290
Take it off!
Don't move!

400
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,915
Calm down, Siv.

401
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,999
Don't just sit there!
Talk, chat, converse!

402
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:46,249
-Is that too much to ask for?
-Not at all.

403
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:50,415
Imagine that it's summer.
Time sure does fly!

404
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,624
-Last summer wasn't long ago.
-A year.

405
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,832
Has it been that long?
There you go!

406
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:59,832
We can't do this all summer.
He needs to eat.

407
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:02,957
-Don't worry. He'll be fine.
-Fine!

408
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:07,540
Simon, you just ruined
mommy's Midsummer Eve.

409
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:12,582
Now mommy will be upset all night.
I hope you're happy!

410
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,749
Time sure does fly!
I think it does, at least.

411
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,374
-We're getting older.
-Yeah.

412
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,915
Saturday night
is no longer parties and fun.

413
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:29,999
-Instead, it's doing laundry.
-Don't be so cynical.

414
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:35,749
Your only worry is what kind
of charcoal the barbecue needs!

415
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,874
Simon, come taste this lovely ham.

416
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:41,624
Open your mouth, Simon.
Open it.

417
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:44,915
Just open it.
Open it!

418
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,999
Open your mouth, Simon.

419
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,665
I said, open it!

420
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,290
You will eat this ham!
Open your mouth!

421
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:58,707
-Can't you see you're hurting him?
-He would have said so.

422
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,707
-But he can't talk.
-Yes, he can! He just chooses not to.

423
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,707
Let's see if this hurts!

424
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,165
Stop it!
He doesn't have to eat right now.

425
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:14,457
Fine, but it's your responsibility if
the doctors ask why he doesn't eat.

426
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,374
Fine by me.
You're witnesses.

427
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,665
-Where were we?
-Time flies.

428
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,665
Nothing works out as planned and all
you want to do is die. Cheers!

429
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,707
Cheers, everybody.

430
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,832
Svein, 16.

431
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,457
-Take me, for example.
-Not now, darling.

432
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,874
I never got to attend art school.

433
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:47,540
Instead, I took the safe route
and worked in an office for 17 years.

434
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,749
Not that it was my dream.

435
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:55,249
Then I mustered up the courage to
quit my job and apply to art school.

436
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:58,457
400 applicants.
Six were admitted.

437
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,499
I was one of them.

438
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:08,207
Then what happened?

439
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,540
I got pregnant.

440
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:16,999
I got pregnant
with mommy's little Simon.

441
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,332
Mommy's little Simon.

442
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,040
-Remember what you said, Svein?
-No.

443
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:30,582
"You always get a second chance."
But I didn't.

444
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,165
Stop biting.

445
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,249
Anyway...
Cheers, everybody.

446
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:48,999
Cheers!

447
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:57,874
She's actually right.
We never have enough time.

448
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:03,540
Yesterday was Christmas,
today it's Midsummer, you know?

449
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,082
Cheers.

450
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:11,665
Perhaps God is in heaven
pushing the fast-forward button.

451
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,332
What did you say?

452
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:18,540
God is tired of the world.

453
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:22,749
So he's fast-forwarding us to the end.

454
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,165
What a horrible thing to say.

455
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,165
-I can't understand Danish.
-Who can?

456
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,582
Look at the sky.
Look at the clouds. Look at that sky!

457
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:37,457
This is what it looks like when
God arrives with his heavenly host.

458
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,332
-Down the hatch!
-There's that rumbling again.

459
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,832
-It's done that for days.
-Probably just thunder.

460
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,749
Probably just a phenomenon.

461
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:56,082
Look at the sky! The clouds! Imagine
how exciting if he came tonight.

462
00:41:56,166 --> 00:42:00,540
That would suck.
We have three weeks of vacation left.

463
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,999
Like I care, with the view we have.

464
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,290
Who's this "he" you referred to?

465
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,624
God!

466
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:17,124
That's either Mozart or Beethoven.

467
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:23,332
Aren't we humans extraordinary?
We always think we have a choice.

468
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,374
Just like the Jews.

469
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:32,582
First, they await their savior
for thousands of years.

470
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:38,040
And when he finally arrives,
they crucify him!

471
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,499
Then they sit and wait
for another 2000 years! Great odds!

472
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:51,749
Like someone will volunteer when they
know what happened to the last one!

473
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,624
I don't get it!

474
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:01,040
-Are you talking about Jews?
-Some characters, huh?

475
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:03,874
-I'm Jewish.
-I see.

476
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,374
-A Polish Jew.
-Polish!

477
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:15,082
I live in Denmark. But don't think
I clean houses for small change.

478
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:19,207
I was in Auschwitz as a child.
You could call that an experience.

479
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,040
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.

480
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:25,582
Auschwitz isn't your fault.
You weren't even born.

481
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:29,999
You got that right.
It actually isn't our fault.

482
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,249
Right.

483
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,915
But the Serb concentration camps
in Bosnia, -

484
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:39,499
- or Guantanamo,
are harder to dismiss.

485
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,665
Give me a break!

486
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:46,874
It isn't our fault
that they keep bickering!

487
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,415
Fine.
Have it your way.

488
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:56,082
But I can understand God
fast-forwarding, to find the culprits.

489
00:43:56,166 --> 00:44:00,790
-Excuse me, what damned God?
-God! You know who!

490
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,957
Here we're expected
to believe in a God -

491
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:08,374
- who will return to judge
the living and the dead.

492
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:12,249
-I don't believe in God.
-Me neither!

493
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:18,790
What do you believe in, then?
If you don't mind me asking.

494
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,124
I have no clue.

495
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,790
I don't know what I believe in.

496
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:30,499
-What about you?
-I... It's difficult to explain.

497
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,582
I believe in...

498
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,415
Summer?

499
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:47,249
Fine.
So that's what you believe in.

500
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:50,082
I guess that's settled.

501
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:55,207
I just felt a raindrop.

502
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:58,290
It can't start raining now!

503
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:03,374
She was mistaken.
I guarantee it won't rain. Trust me!

504
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,624
Christ!
The food. The food!

505
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,415
Ingrid!

506
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:30,249
Ingrid, don't sing!

507
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,624
Don't sing!

508
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,374
I'm sorry.

509
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:43,832
-Where are you going?
-To take a shower.

510
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,165
Where did Simon go?
Simon!

511
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,457
-Simon?
-Simon!

512
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,332
-Simon, where are you?
-Simon!

513
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:59,790
Simon?

514
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:03,082
-There he is!
-Has he been there all along?

515
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:07,082
-I don't know.
-At least he's here now.

516
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,874
It was raining blood!
Talk about bad weather.

517
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,832
They didn't mention that
in the brochure.

518
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:24,707
They could have put that under
miscellaneous: "Rains blood".

519
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:28,915
I'm sure it was just
some...phenomenon.

520
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,832
What kind of phenomenon?

521
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:37,457
Probably iron particles in the air
that turn the rain red.

522
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:42,540
-Seriously? Could that explain it?
-Yes, I think so.

523
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:45,290
What a relief!

524
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:49,499
In that case
I'll go in and get some more food.

525
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,707
-It's so light out.
-Maybe it's the midnight sun.

526
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,624
This far south?

527
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:02,207
Look!
A shooting star!

528
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,582
Look how beautiful!

529
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,874
Finally something nice.

530
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:12,582
It's just a meteorite
hitting our atmosphere.

531
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,624
Sorry.
I didn't know.

532
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:19,249
Or it could be a space station
that dropped something.

533
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:23,207
Like a bag of astronaut excrement?

534
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,124
Give me a break!
Astronaut crap?

535
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:32,332
Some people say all that space debris
is dangerous for space shuttles.

536
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:37,665
If a bag of crap hits a shuttle,
the shuttle will be disintegrated!

537
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,957
-Come on!
-Isn't that funny?

538
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:45,790
I'm sure you're right, but I've always
felt there was someone out there.

539
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:51,499
Whether it's God, Buddha
or a spaceship, I don't know.

540
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,957
It's probably Elvis.

541
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:58,915
-Did you know Elvis had a brother?
-He did?

542
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,915
Twelvis!

543
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,165
Get it?

544
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,665
Elvis, twelvis, thirtis...

545
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:12,165
-Sure you need more to drink, darling?
-Go screw yourself, darling.

546
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,832
-Hear that?
-What?

547
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,582
Locusts.

548
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:25,915
Weird, they normally occur
later in the year.

549
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,332
Look!

550
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,999
-The lady!
-The lady!

551
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,832
Hey, lady!

552
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:40,124
Lady!

553
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,749
Hey, lady!

554
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:49,999
-Maybe she's asleep?
-No, she'd fall off the chair.

555
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:53,749
-We can't leave her there.
-Maybe she isn't asleep.

556
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:58,082
-Maybe she's had a heart attack.
-You mean she's dead?

557
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:03,332
Typical! We're finally having some fun
and the old hag dies on us.

558
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,832
That is so typical!

559
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:09,499
In this heat she'll start smelling.

560
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,915
-Svein, do something.
-Why me?

561
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,999
Because you're a man.

562
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:19,207
-I'll wake her up.
-Good for you, Stig.

563
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,665
Hello.

564
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,249
Wake up!

565
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:32,082
Rescue me from the mire.

566
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,999
Deliver me from those who hate me.

567
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:38,832
Do not let the floodwaters engulf me -

568
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:41,457
- or the pit close its mouth over me.

569
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,457
Answer me, Lord,
out of the goodness of your love.

570
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,457
In your great mercy turn to me.

571
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,999
Do not hide your face
from your servant.

572
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,874
Answer me quickly,
for I am in trouble.

573
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:57,082
Make haste to answer me....

574
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,665
Is it you?

575
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,457
All of you?

576
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,582
She wasn't dead.

577
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,665
Cheers, ma'am.

578
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,707
-Are you going to drink more?
-Till there's nothing left, my dear.

579
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,582
Sometimes I wish I didn't know you.

580
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:49,874
Look! Another shooting star.
Or whatever it is.

581
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:56,415
And the stars in the sky fell to
earth, as figs drop from a fig tree -

582
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,499
- when shaken by a strong wind.

583
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,124
What is that?

584
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:04,957
I watched as he opened the sixth seal.

585
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,874
There was a great earthquake.

586
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:15,124
The sun turned black like sackcloth,
the whole moon turned blood red.

587
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:18,040
That's so beautiful.

588
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,165
-Don't sing!
-Sorry.

589
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,832
What seal is that?

590
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,624
When he opened the seventh seal, -

591
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:28,957
- there was silence in heaven
for about half an hour.

592
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,124
The Book of Revelation,
chapter 8, verse 1.

593
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:38,415
I have no clue what
that old hag is talking about.

594
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:43,332
I have a great idea.
Let's go for a swim! A midnight dip.

595
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,499
Give me one good reason.

596
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:50,790
It's a sinful summer night.
A little bare skin. Come on, Stig!

597
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:55,290
Let's do it now!
It's Midsummer and all!

598
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,124
See some pussy and titties,
know what I mean?

599
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:05,124
Yeah, fuck it!
Let's go cool off.

600
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:09,415
Go ahead, so Ingrid and I
can get some peace and quiet.

601
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:16,082
You can't stay here! It can't just be
us two. You have to join us.

602
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,457
I'd love to join you.

603
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:24,207
-You?
-We won't need bathing suits, will we?

604
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,374
Hang on.
I feel a little queasy.

605
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:33,457
A little weak. And my throat's sore.
Maybe I shouldn't swim.

606
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,415
I'm ready!

607
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,832
Stop!
I know what you're up to.

608
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,332
I don't understand.

609
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:44,915
I know your type.
A lonely old hag like you.

610
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,790
You rent a cabin and expect
everything to be nice.

611
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:51,124
You couldn't be more fucking wrong!

612
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:54,790
We've rented cabins,
but we're not together!

613
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:58,207
-I thought we were swimming.
-Like hell!

614
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,290
The line goes right here.
You're there, and I'm here.

615
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:06,624
-Enough is enough!
-I didn't mean to upset you.

616
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:11,832
-Don't take it that way.
-Don't be so fucking sentimental.

617
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:15,374
And stop biting! That's how
you put someone in their place.

618
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:21,040
Are we going swimming, or not?
Grab that bottle. Come on.

619
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:27,415
-Jesus Christ.
-I know. I'm sorry.

620
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:30,040
How can you stay with him?

621
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:35,290
Mother always said
you eat what's on your plate.

622
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:39,749
That's how she lived her life,
and the same goes for me.

623
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:45,499
We live 70-80 years. It's just
a matter of enduring those years.

624
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:47,624
Give me a break!

625
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:54,124
Never mind what he said.
Come and eat with us.

626
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:58,832
If there's some left over,
I wouldn't mind a little bite.

627
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,374
Weren't you a little harsh with her?

628
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:09,332
-Don't be so sentimental.
-I'm sorry.

629
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:19,790
-Holy shit! That's disgusting.
-And they say there isn't enough fish?

630
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:23,457
-What are we waiting for?
-Nothing.

631
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:38,040
So have you known each other long?

632
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:42,499
Who, us?
No, we just met today.

633
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:45,332
You don't know each other?

634
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:49,874
I've been married to Svein
for 20 years and hardly know him.

635
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:51,999
But you love him.

636
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:54,249
Love Svein?

637
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:59,874
I don't know.
I guess I do. Probably.

638
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:04,290
He was the one I chose,
so he became my life.

639
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:09,832
He was the one that ended up
on my plate, so to speak.

640
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:16,124
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

641
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,790
-It sure is hot.
-Yeah.

642
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:29,582
It's like a free jacuzzi!

643
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:35,874
-Doesn't it smell strange?
-The water, you mean?

644
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:39,457
I was just thinking...
No, never mind.

645
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,165
-Ready?
-Sure!

646
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,582
Three, two, one!

647
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:02,207
-Strange light!
-Maybe it's...

648
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:06,040
-Astronaut poo!
-That hit a space shuttle?

649
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:09,499
What did you call those little red...

650
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,790
-Iron particles.
-Right! Iron particles!

651
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:18,790
And you don't have any children?

652
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:23,124
No, we've tried many times
but without success.

653
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:28,207
I think there's something wrong
with me. Ever since my abortion...

654
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,915
I didn't mean to...

655
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:35,207
It's OK.
It was a long time ago.

656
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:38,499
It's all right.
I was only...

657
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,665
17 years old.

658
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,999
The doctor said
everything would be OK.

659
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,915
When I came to,
they gave me a glass of juice.

660
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,540
And two sandwiches, cut diagonally.

661
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:03,582
Then the doctor came and said
there had been some complications, -

662
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:07,832
- but that she thought
everything was OK.

663
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:11,665
But I don't think everything was OK.

664
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,790
I never was able
to get pregnant again.

665
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:18,457
Fuck!
That doctor should have been killed!

666
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,499
Maybe you're right.

667
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,040
What about you?

668
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,999
It's a long story.

669
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:35,082
We have plenty of time.
Don't we, Ingrid?

670
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:38,915
Yes, perhaps we do.

671
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,040
Or perhaps not.

672
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,915
It's sticky.

673
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,665
-It's so damn quiet.
-Yeah.

674
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:59,457
-Like being alone in the world.
-Yeah. Imagine if we were!

675
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,915
If that were the case,
we should swap wives -

676
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,665
- and nail both of them. To get
more genetic variation, I mean.

677
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,624
What did your wife see in you?

678
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:18,207
I worked in the home help service
for 30 years.

679
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:26,124
And for 15 of those 30 years
I took care of a woman called Karin.

680
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:30,915
Karin would wait for me
at her kitchen table.

681
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:36,040
She'd sit there
with her big, black, inquisitive eyes.

682
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:42,707
Every morning,
she got out of bed and got dressed.

683
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:45,999
And then she sat down and waited.

684
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:52,207
When I came she would smile,
as if saying, "Have you come for me?"

685
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:59,165
And one day it hit me.
I could never go back to Karin again.

686
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:03,040
Because it wasn't me
she was waiting for.

687
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:09,374
She was waiting for someone
to come for her, but no one came.

688
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:16,249
Like it says in the Bible. This is
what the end of time will be like.

689
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:23,457
Two men will be in the field.
One will be taken and the other left.

690
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:28,749
Two women will be at a mill.
One will be taken, the other left.

691
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,624
What are you talking about?

692
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:39,832
Two men at the beach.
Two women at a table talking.

693
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:45,749
It may be too late. God has come
for those who belong to his flock.

694
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:49,499
Do you understand what I'm saying?

695
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:02,749
I don't understand anything.
But that's nothing new.

696
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,999
Ingrid, let's go inside
and do something nice.

697
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:22,457
This weather
is totally fucking unreliable.

698
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,249
-Where's Stig?
-Stig and Svein went swimming.

699
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:31,457
-Where did the lady go?
-The lady... I don't know.

700
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,582
I'm so scared.
Siv, hold me!

701
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:40,915
Sorry, but I'm not
a very cuddly person.

702
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:46,665
Maybe you'd rather...
Maybe I can get you a sweater?

703
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,749
Or a blanket?
How about some cognac?

704
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:53,457
Let me get some cognac.
Stay here.

705
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:02,124
-It wouldn't take long.
-Shut up.

706
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:05,582
We're talking about
the future of mankind.

707
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:09,874
-You're not fucking my wife!
-I'd consider it my duty.

708
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:12,707
I can't fuck,
I have prostate cancer!

709
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:17,749
It's spreading rapidly.
I can't bring myself to tell her.

710
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,707
I'm sorry to hear that.

711
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:23,957
-Don't be so sentimental.
-I'm sorry.

712
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:29,540
But on average,
intercourse only lasts two minutes!

713
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:38,290
Simon?

714
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,957
Help!

715
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,165
Get them off me, Siv!

716
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,707
That's all I needed.

717
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,540
-Do something!
-Like what?

718
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:09,124
Get them off me!

719
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:17,165
Get them off me!
They're disgusting

720
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,165
Cognac.
Cheers, nice to meet you.

721
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,790
Likewise.

722
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,332
Stig!

723
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:36,540
Oh, Stig!

724
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:46,207
What a mess!

725
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,707
This party sucks.

726
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,749
Is something wrong?

727
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,040
I'm turning in.

728
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:08,874
-Did you put Simon to bed?
-Didn't you?

729
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:12,540
Cut it out.
You put him to bed.

730
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:17,457
-Is that my job, suddenly?
-I'm asking if you put him to bed!

731
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:23,249
What the fuck?
You talk like it's my responsibility.

732
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:27,749
It's just as much yours.
You blame me for everything!

733
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:33,457
-Simon isn't there.
-What are you talking about?

734
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:38,540
-He isn't there.
-Of course he is! For fuck's sake.

735
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:52,249
-Simon!
-Simon, answer us!

736
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:56,040
-What happened?
-Simon's gone.

737
01:06:56,125 --> 01:07:00,374
-He was sitting on that rock.
-Simon!

738
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:05,165
-Simon!
-Wait! We have to think rationally!

739
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:11,124
Think rationally! There must
be a reasonable explanation, OK?

740
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:15,457
-Let's start with where!
-He might be hiding.

741
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,290
Where?

742
01:07:57,333 --> 01:08:02,207
-Jesus Christ.
-We have to think. Think.

743
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:04,624
He can't be far off.

744
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:08,874
The lady!
The lady took him!

745
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,915
-The lady!
-To the reception!

746
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,540
Stig!

747
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,415
Where is the reception?

748
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,457
Did we run the wrong way?

749
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,415
No, this is right.

750
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,165
Simon!

751
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,040
Stig, hold me.

752
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:15,915
-Simon, my boy! Are you here?
-Oh, my God.

753
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,665
-I want my baby!
-Simon!

754
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,124
Simon, where are you?

755
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:24,374
Maybe they're down by the cabins.

756
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:27,374
-I wouldn't know!
-But maybe they are!

757
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:29,207
Svein!

758
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:35,374
Svein, you have to wake up!
We have to look for him!

759
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:38,499
-Find him!
-What the hell is going on?

760
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:42,790
I don't know.
I'm not a scientist, I'm a humanist.

761
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,499
Simon!

762
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:47,999
Answer when mommy and daddy
call for you!

763
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,790
Don't go.

764
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:52,290
Don't go!

765
01:09:57,666 --> 01:10:01,124
I've never felt safe on my own.

766
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,582
What is it?

767
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,249
-Stop biting.
-Sorry.

768
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:33,999
Simon!

769
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,624
Simon, where are you?
Simon!

770
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:42,790
Simon!

771
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:48,165
-I don't understand this.
-Everything's gone!

772
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:06,082
Daddy's beloved boy, come out!
This isn't funny anymore.

773
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,124
Daddy loves you, Simon.
I love you so much!

774
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:15,915
-Simon!
-That isn't how you pronounce it.

775
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:20,374
-You pronounce his name wrong!
-What are you talking about?

776
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:26,124
-You can't pronounce your son's name!
-What is your problem?

777
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,832
Our Father, who lives in...

778
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,999
Our Father, who art in...

779
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,749
-Where was he again?
-In heaven.

780
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:55,499
In heaven.

781
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,665
So this is where you are.

782
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:00,499
Come.
It's time to go.

783
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:06,332
Hold my hand, and you'll see
that everything will be just fine.

784
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:13,374
-I'm holding your hand.
-Indeed you are.

785
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:17,124
You are holding my hand.

786
