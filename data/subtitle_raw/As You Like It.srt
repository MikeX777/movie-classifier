1
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,895
As I remember, Adam.
It was upon this fashion.

2
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:53,249
My father bequeathed me by will
but poor a thousand crowns.

3
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,559
And charged my brother on his
blessing to breed me well.

4
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:58,630
And there begins my sadness.

5
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,982
He stays me at home unkept.

6
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:05,677
For call you that 'keeping'
for a gentleman of my birth.

7
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,185
That differs not from
the stalling of an ox?

8
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:12,319
He lets me feed with his hinds.

9
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,817
Bars me the place of a brother
and as much as in him lies.

10
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,667
Mines my gentility with my education.

11
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,261
This is it, Adam, that grieves me.

12
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,243
And the spirit of my father
which I think is within me.

13
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:28,667
Begins to mutiny against this servitude.

14
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:30,712
I will no longer endure it.

15
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,408
Psst. Master Orlando.

16
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,154
Yonder he comes.

17
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:42,313
Stay apart, and thou shalt hear
how he will shake me up.

18
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:52,037
Now, sir. What make you here?

19
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,261
Nothing. I am not taught
to make anything.

20
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,512
Marry, sir. Be better employed.

21
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,923
Shall I keep your hogs
and eat husks with them?

22
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,132
Know you where you are, sir?

23
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:03,013
I know you are my eldest brother.

24
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,945
And in the gentle condition of
blood you should so know me.

25
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,528
I have as much of my
father in me as you.

26
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:09,922
What, boy.

27
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,837
Come, come, elder brother.
You are too young in this.

28
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,451
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
- I am no villain.

29
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,612
I am the youngest son
of Sir Rowland de Boys.

30
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:20,522
And he is thrice a villain that
says such a father begot villains.

31
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:23,704
Wert thou not my brother, I would
not take this hand from thy throat ..

32
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,118
Till this other had pulled out
thy tongue for saying so.

33
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:27,840
Sweet masters, be patient.

34
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:30,552
For your father's
remembrance, be at accord.

35
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,285
Let me go I say.

36
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,682
I will not till I please.
You shall hear me.

37
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,567
My father charged you by his
will to give me good education.

38
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:39,773
You have trained me like a peasant.

39
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:43,697
And the spirit of my father grows strong
within me. I will no longer endure it.

40
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:47,988
Therefore, give me the poor allottery
my father left me by testament.

41
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,235
With that I will go buy my fortunes.

42
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,387
Well, sir. Get you in.

43
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:57,959
I will not long be troubled with you.
You shall have some part of your will.

44
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,000
I pray you leave me.

45
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,809
I will no further offend you
than becomes me for my good.

46
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,457
Get you with him, you old dog.

47
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,977
Is 'old dog' my reward?

48
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:25,050
Most true, I have lost my
teeth in your service.

49
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,610
I will physic your rankness.

50
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:39,002
And yet give no thousand crowns neither.

51
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,057
Holla. Dennis.

52
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,413
Calls your Worship?

53
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,915
Was not Charles, the Duke's wrestler,
here to speak with me?

54
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,645
So please you, he is here at the door.

55
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:06,507
Call him in.

56
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:16,957
Good morrow, your Worship.
- Good Monsieur Charles.

57
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,393
What is the new news of the new court?

58
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:24,214
There is no news at the court,
sir, but the old news.

59
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:28,407
That is, the old duke is banished
by his younger brother the new duke.

60
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,297
Where will the old duke live?

61
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,541
They say he is already
in the Forest of Arden.

62
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,204
And many merry men with him.

63
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:39,284
And there they live like the
old Robin Hood of England.

64
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,888
You wrestle tomorrow
before the new duke?

65
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:46,993
Marry, do I, sir.

66
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,604
And I came to acquaint
you with a matter.

67
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,402
I am given, sir, secretly to understand
that your younger brother Orlando ..

68
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,630
Comes against me to try a fall.

69
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,313
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit.

70
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,674
And he that escapes me
without some broken limb.

71
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,038
Shall acquit him well.

72
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,110
Therefore, out of my loved to you.

73
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,892
I came hither to acquaint you.

74
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,432
That you might stay him.

75
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,217
Charles.

76
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:21,069
I thank thee for thy love to me.

77
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:24,627
Which I will most kindly requite.

78
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll tell thee, Charles.

79
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:32,556
My brother.

80
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:35,187
Is the stubbornest
young fellow of France.

81
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,845
A secret and villainous
contriver against me.

82
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:40,974
His natural brother.

83
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,225
Therefore, use thy discretion.

84
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:50,679
I had as lief thou didst
break his neck as his finger.

85
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:56,597
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.

86
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,202
If he come tomorrow.

87
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:02,416
I'll give him his payment.

88
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:05,675
If ever he go alone again.

89
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:09,162
I'll never wrestle for prize more.

90
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:13,135
And so keep good, your Worship.
- Farewell, good Charles.

91
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:25,766
I hope I shall see an end of him.

92
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,064
For my soul.

93
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,420
Yet I know not why.

94
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:36,690
Hates nothing more than he.

95
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,934
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz.

96
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:07,487
Be merry.

97
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:11,693
Dear Celia, I show more
mirth than I am mistress of.

98
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:17,238
Unless you could teach to
forget a banished father.

99
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:21,967
You must not learn me how to
remember any extraordinary pleasure.

100
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,855
Herein I see thou lov'st me not with
the full weight that I love thee.

101
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:30,282
If my uncle, thy banished father.

102
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:33,428
Had banished my uncle,
the Duke thy father.

103
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,874
So thou hadst been still with me.

104
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:39,394
I could have taught my love
to take thy father for mine.

105
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,056
So wouldst thou.

106
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:47,109
If the truth of thy love to me were so
righteously tempered as mine is to thee.

107
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,261
Well.

108
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,762
I will forget.

109
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,487
You know my father hath no child but I?

110
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:58,267
And truly, when he dies,
thou shalt be his heir.

111
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:01,138
For what he hath taken away
from thy father perforce.

112
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,558
I will render thee again in affection.

113
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,388
By mine honor I will.

114
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,982
And when I break that oath,
let me turn monster.

115
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,906
Therefore, my sweet Rose.

116
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:13,674
My dear Rose.

117
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:15,014
Be Merry.

118
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:16,989
From henceforth I will, coz.

119
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,625
And devise sports.

120
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:21,350
Let me see.

121
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,286
What think you .. of falling in love?

122
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:28,542
Marry, I prithee do.
To make sport withal.

123
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,595
Love no man in good earnest.

124
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:35,642
Nor no further in sport neither
than with safety of a pure blush.

125
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:39,073
Thou mayst in honor come off again.
- What shall be our sport then?

126
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:42,224
Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.

127
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:44,446
With his mouth full of news.

128
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,663
Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau.
What's the news?

129
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,506
Fair princess.
You're going to lose much good sport.

130
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,248
Sport? Of what color?

131
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:01,749
What color, madam?

132
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:03,806
How shall I answer you?

133
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:05,507
As wit and fortune will.

134
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:07,579
Et bien, j'allais justement vous dire.

135
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,407
Good wrestling, ladies.
And they are ready to perform it.

136
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:13,890
Let us see it, coz.

137
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:02,744
Come on.

138
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:07,774
Since this youth will not be entreated,
his own peril on his forwardness.

139
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,072
Is yonder, the man?

140
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:17,886
Even he madam.

141
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,886
Alas, he is too young.

142
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:22,150
How now, daughter and cousin?

143
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,385
Are you crept hither
to see the wrestling?

144
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:25,765
Ay, my liege.

145
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:28,126
So please you give us leave.

146
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:31,885
You will take little delight in it I can
tell you. There is such odds in the man.

147
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,680
In pity of the challenger's
youth I would fain dissuade him.

148
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:36,431
But he will not be entreated.

149
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:40,084
Speak to him, ladies.
See if you can move him.

150
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:41,469
I'll not be by.

151
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,994
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

152
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,857
Monsieur the challenger.

153
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,067
The Princess calls for you.

154
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,727
I attend them with all respect and duty.

155
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,116
Young man.

156
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:11,784
Have you challenged
Charles the wrestler?

157
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,143
No, fair princess.
He is the general challenger.

158
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:18,916
I come but in as others do, to try
with him the strength of my youth.

159
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:22,820
Young gentleman, your spirits
are too bold for your years.

160
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:26,157
We pray you for your own
sake to give over this attempt.

161
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:28,460
Do, young sir.

162
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,868
I beseech you, punish me
not with your hard thoughts.

163
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:36,569
Wherein I confess me much guilty to deny
so fair and excellent ladies anything.

164
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,077
But let your fair eyes and gentle
wishes go with me to my trial.

165
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,370
Wherein, if I be foiled.

166
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,276
There is but one shamed
who was never gracious.

167
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:49,722
If killed, but one dead
that is willing to be so.

168
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,439
I shall do my friends no wrong.

169
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:54,274
For I have none to lament me.

170
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,478
The world no injury.
For in it I have nothing.

171
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,344
Only In the world.

172
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:02,473
I fill up a place which may be better
supplied when I have made it empty.

173
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:09,648
The little strength that I have,
I would it were with you.

174
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,645
And mine, to eke out hers.

175
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:22,475
Come.

176
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,088
Where is this young gallant ..

177
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:29,295
That is so desirous to lie
with his mother Earth?

178
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:31,286
You mean to mock me after?

179
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:33,973
You should not have mocked me before.

180
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:35,579
But come your ways.

181
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:53,883
Now Hercules be thy speed, young man.

182
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:57,326
I would I were invisible.
To catch the strong fellow by the leg.

183
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:11,272
No more. No more.

184
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:23,877
How dost thou, Charles?

185
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:29,168
He cannot speak, my lord.

186
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:30,750
Bear him away.

187
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,373
What is thy name, young man?

188
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:05,811
Orlando, my liege.

189
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,023
The youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

190
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:15,055
I would thou hadst been
son to some man else.

191
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:19,015
The world esteemed thy father honorable.

192
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:21,545
But I did find him still mine enemy.

193
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:25,675
But fare thee well.
Thou art a gallant youth.

194
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:32,109
I would thou hadst told
me of another father.

195
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,382
Were I my father, coz.

196
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:51,758
Would I do this?

197
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:56,634
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul.

198
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,807
Gentle cousin.

199
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,589
Let us go thank him and encourage him.

200
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:10,407
Sir.

201
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,906
You have well deserved.

202
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:16,815
If you do keep your
promises in love, but justly.

203
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:20,245
As you have exceeded promise.
Your mistress shall be happy.

204
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,027
Gentleman.

205
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,949
Wear this for me.

206
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,887
One out of suits with Fortune.

207
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,151
That could give more.

208
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:31,816
But that her hand lacks means.

209
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,810
Shall we go, coz?

210
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:37,298
Fare you well, fair gentleman.

211
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:42,211
Can I not say 'thank you'?

212
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,204
He calls us back.

213
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,846
My pride fell with my fortunes.

214
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,001
I'll ask him what he would.

215
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:55,589
Did you call, sir?

216
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,349
Sir, you have wrestled well.

217
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,902
And overthrown more than your enemies.

218
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,812
Will you go, Rosalind?

219
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,393
Have with you.

220
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,312
Fare thee well.

221
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:25,738
What passion hangs these
weights upon my tongue?

222
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:29,092
I cannot speak to her.

223
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,399
Yet she urged conference.

224
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,088
O poor Orlando. Thou art overthrown.

225
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:41,953
Or Charles or something
weaker masters thee.

226
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,532
Good sir, I do in friendship
counsel you to leave this place.

227
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:52,460
Albeit you have deserved
high commendation.

228
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:53,729
Yet.

229
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:58,003
Such is now the duke's condition that
he misconstrues all that you have done.

230
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,345
I thank you, sir.
And pray you tell me this.

231
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:05,746
Which of the two was daughter of the
duke that here was at the wrestling?

232
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:07,912
Indeed, the taller is his daughter.

233
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,471
The other is Rosalind,
daughter to the banished duke.

234
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:15,675
I can tell you. Of late this duke takes
displeasure against his gentle niece.

235
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,793
Grounded upon no other argument.

236
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:22,178
That people praise her for her virtues
and pity her for her good father's sake.

237
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:26,683
And on my life, his malice against
this lady will suddenly break forth.

238
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:28,875
Sir. Fare you well.

239
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,032
I rest much bounden to you.

240
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,095
Fare you well.

241
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,895
Thus must I from the
smoke into the smother.

242
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:55,960
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.

243
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:04,207
But heavenly Rosalind.

244
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,611
Rosalind.

245
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,334
Why cousin.

246
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,780
Why Rosalind.

247
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:30,382
Cupid have mercy.

248
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:31,715
Not a word?

249
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,810
Not one to throw at a dog.

250
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:36,647
But is all this for your father?

251
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:37,572
No.

252
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:41,270
Some of it is for my father's child.

253
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:44,937
Come, come.
Wrestle with your affections.

254
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:48,359
O, they take the part of a
better wrestler than myself.

255
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,070
Is it possible on such a sudden ..

256
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,879
You should fall into so strong a liking
with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

257
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,940
The Duke my father.

258
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,900
Loved his father dearly.

259
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,011
Doth it therefore ensue that you
should love his son dearly?

260
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:03,954
No.

261
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,012
By this kind of chase I should hate him.

262
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,395
For my father hated his father dearly.

263
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:10,182
Yet I hate not Orlando.

264
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:13,531
No, faith. Hate him not for my sake.

265
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,370
Look.

266
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,012
Here comes the Duke.

267
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,060
Mistress, dispatch you
with your safest haste.

268
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,757
And get you from our court.

269
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:35,800
Me, uncle?

270
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:36,913
You, cousin.

271
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:39,764
Within these ten days if
that thou beest found ..

272
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,346
So near our public
court as twenty miles.

273
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:44,035
Thou diest for it.

274
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:48,103
I do beseech, your Grace.

275
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:52,025
Let me the knowledge of
my fault bear with me.

276
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:56,877
Never so much as in a thought
unborn did I offend your Highness.

277
00:22:57,818 --> 00:22:59,086
Thus do all traitors.

278
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,779
Thou art thy father's daughter.
There's enough.

279
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:03,857
So was I.

280
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:06,916
When your Highness took his dukedom.

281
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:10,438
So was I when your
Highness banished him.

282
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:14,226
Treason is not inherited, my lord.

283
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:18,870
Or if we did derive it from our
friends, what's that to me?

284
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:22,127
My father was no traitor.

285
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:27,005
Then, good my liege,
mistake me not so much.

286
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:29,747
To think my poverty is treacherous.

287
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:32,454
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
- Ay, Celia.

288
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:35,509
We stayed her for your sake, else had
she with her father ranged along.

289
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:37,758
If she be a traitor, why so am I.

290
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:39,970
We still have slept together.

291
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,894
Rose at an instant.
Learned, played, eat together.

292
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:45,857
Still we went coupled and inseparable.

293
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,217
Thou art a fool.
She robs thee of thy name.

294
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,502
And thou wilt show more bright and
seem more virtuous when she is gone.

295
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:54,304
No, my liege.
- Open not thy lips.

296
00:23:54,803 --> 00:23:57,384
Firm and irrevocable is my doom.
She is banished.

297
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:00,964
Pronounce that sentence
then on me, my liege.

298
00:24:01,494 --> 00:24:03,326
I cannot live out of her company.

299
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:05,757
You are a fool.

300
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,282
You, niece. Provide yourself.

301
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,553
If you outstay the time.

302
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:11,932
Upon mine honor.

303
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:14,058
And in the greatness of my word.

304
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:15,359
You die.

305
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:41,805
O, my poor Rosalind.

306
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,387
Whither wilt thou go?

307
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,306
Wilt thou change fathers?

308
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,961
I will give thee mine.

309
00:24:58,058 --> 00:24:59,352
I charge thee.

310
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,207
Be not thou more grieved than I am.

311
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,569
I have more cause.

312
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:08,979
Thou hast not, cousin.

313
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,182
Prithee, be cheerful.

314
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,255
Know'st thou not the
Duke hath banished me ..

315
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:15,792
His daughter?

316
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,319
That he hath not.

317
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:19,033
No.

318
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:20,546
Hath not?

319
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:24,750
Rosalind lacks then the love
which teacheth thee that thou ..

320
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,299
And I am one.

321
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:29,537
Shall we be sundered?

322
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,115
Shall we part?

323
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:36,435
Sweet girl.

324
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:37,735
No.

325
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,757
Let my father seek another heir.

326
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:44,399
For, by this heaven,
now at our sorrows pale.

327
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,278
Say what thou cans't.

328
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:47,935
I'll go along with thee.

329
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:49,116
Why.

330
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,837
Whither shall we go?

331
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,814
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.

332
00:26:00,564 --> 00:26:03,416
<i>What shall he have that killed the deer?</i>

333
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,848
<i>His leather skin and horns to wear</i>.

334
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:10,237
<i>Take thou no scorn to wear the horn</i>.

335
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:14,057
<i>It was a crest ere thou was born</i>.

336
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:17,697
<i>Thy father's father wore it</i>.

337
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,008
<i>And thy father bore it</i>.

338
00:26:21,818 --> 00:26:25,009
<i>The horn, the horn, the lusty horn</i>.

339
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:29,129
<i>Is not a thing to laugh to scorn</i>.

340
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:34,319
Now my co-mates and brothers in exile.

341
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,736
Hath not old custom made
this life more sweet ..

342
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,789
Than that of painted pomp?

343
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:44,236
Are not these woods more free
from peril than the envious court?

344
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,226
Here feel we not the penalty of Adam.

345
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,440
The seasons' difference.

346
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:53,417
As the icy fang and churlish
chiding of the winter's wind.

347
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:56,570
Which, when it bites
and blows upon my body.

348
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:58,916
Even till I shrink with cold.

349
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:01,129
I smile and say:

350
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,223
'This is no flattery'.

351
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,302
These are counselors.

352
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:07,776
'That feelingly persuade me'.

353
00:27:08,391 --> 00:27:09,431
'What I am'.

354
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:13,616
Sweet are the uses of adversity.

355
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:17,012
Which like the toad, ugly and venomous.

356
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,083
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.

357
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:23,911
And this our life,
exempt from public haunt.

358
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,369
Finds tongues in trees.

359
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,542
Books in the running brooks.

360
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:30,836
Sermons in stones.

361
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,451
And good.

362
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,580
In everything.

363
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:36,863
I would not change it.

364
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,637
Happy is your Grace.

365
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:43,997
That can translate the stubbornness
of fortune Into so quiet ..

366
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:46,393
And so sweet a style.

367
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:56,366
<i>Blow, blow, thou winter wind</i>.

368
00:27:57,668 --> 00:28:01,305
<i>Thou art not so unkind</i>.

369
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,715
<i>Thou art not so unkind</i>.

370
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:09,753
<i>As man's ingratitude</i>.

371
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:16,678
<i>Thy tooth is not so keen</i>.

372
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:21,414
<i>Because thou art not seen</i>.

373
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:26,212
<i>Thy tooth is not so keen</i>.

374
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:31,840
<i>Because thou art not seen</i>.

375
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:37,287
<i>Although thy breath be rude</i>.

376
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,304
<i>Although thy breath be rude</i>.

377
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:48,362
<i>Although thy breath be rude</i>.

378
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:14,564
Alas.

379
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:16,615
What danger will it be to us.

380
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,495
Maids as we are.

381
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,979
To travel forth so far?

382
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:26,877
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire.

383
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,994
And with a kind of umber smirch my face.

384
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,897
The like do you.

385
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:35,017
So shall we pass along and
never stir assailants?

386
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:37,845
Were it not better.

387
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,565
That I did suit me.

388
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:45,479
All points like a man?

389
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,345
And in my heart.

390
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:51,979
Lie there what hidden
woman's fear there will.

391
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,380
We'll have a swashing
and a martial outside.

392
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:57,969
As many other mannish cowards have.

393
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:00,794
That do outface it with
their semblances.

394
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:04,328
What shall I call thee
when thou art a man?

395
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,078
I'll have no worse a name
than Jove's own page.

396
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,058
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.

397
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:13,295
But what will you be called?

398
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:16,082
Something that hath
reference to my state:

399
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:18,289
No longer Celia.

400
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:20,449
But Aliena.

401
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,746
But cousin.

402
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:27,989
What if we assayed to steal the clownish
fool out of your father's court?

403
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,753
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

404
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,137
He'll go along o'er the
wide world with me.

405
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,856
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away.

406
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:10,011
Now go we in content.

407
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:13,764
To liberty, and not to banishment.

408
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:20,528
Can it be possible that no man saw them?

409
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:22,237
It cannot be.

410
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:26,664
Some villains of my court are of
consent and sufferance in this.

411
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:30,006
I cannot hear of any that did see her.

412
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:32,116
My lord.

413
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,656
The roinish clown at whom so oft Your
Grace was wont to laugh is also missing.

414
00:31:46,717 --> 00:31:48,818
Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman.

415
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:51,275
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard ..

416
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:55,552
Your daughter and her cousin did commend
the parts and graces of the wrestler ..

417
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:58,382
That did but lately foil
the sinewy Charles.

418
00:31:58,781 --> 00:31:59,830
And she believes.

419
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:03,775
Wherever they are gone,
that youth is surely in their company.

420
00:32:05,052 --> 00:32:07,382
Send to that wrestler.
Fetch that gallant hither.

421
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:11,440
If he be absent,
bring his brother to me.

422
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:13,593
I'll make him find him.

423
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:15,918
Do this suddenly.

424
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,572
And let not search or inquisition quail.

425
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:24,313
To bring again these foolish runaways.

426
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:45,014
O my gentle master.

427
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:46,908
O my sweet master.

428
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:50,091
O you memory of old Sir Rowland.

429
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:52,126
Why, what's the matter?

430
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:53,952
O unhappy youth.

431
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:55,828
Within this roof.

432
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,257
The enemy of all your graces lives.

433
00:32:58,818 --> 00:32:59,818
Your brother.

434
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:04,400
This night he means to burn the
lodging where you use to lie.

435
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:06,062
And you within it.

436
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,175
This house is but a butchery.

437
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:10,302
Abhor it. Fear it.

438
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:12,429
Do not stay in it.

439
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:16,290
Why whither, Adam,
wouldst thou have me go?

440
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:19,738
No matter whither, so you stay not here.

441
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:22,930
What, wouldst thou have
me go and beg my food?

442
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,537
I have five hundred crowns.

443
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,078
The thrifty hire I saved
under your father.

444
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:32,988
Here is the gold.

445
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:35,749
All this I give you.

446
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:38,238
Let me be your servant.

447
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:41,057
In all your business and necessities.

448
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,454
O good old man.

449
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:52,533
How well in thee appears the constant
service of the antique world.

450
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,561
When service sweat
for duty, not for meed.

451
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:59,319
Thou art not for the
fashion of these times.

452
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:02,196
Where none will serve but for promotion.

453
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:04,594
But come thy ways.

454
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:06,583
We'll go along together.

455
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,945
And ere we have thy
youthful wages spent.

456
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,466
We'll light upon some
settled low content.

457
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:46,220
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits.

458
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,428
I care not for my spirits.

459
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:50,768
If my legs were not so weary.

460
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:55,917
I could find in my heart to
disgrace my man's apparel.

461
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:58,290
And to cry like a woman.

462
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,907
I pray you bear with me.
I can go no further.

463
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,673
For my part, I had rather
bear with you than bear you.

464
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,805
Well, this is the Forest of Arden.

465
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:14,598
Ay, now am I in Arden.

466
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,476
The more fool I.

467
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:19,647
When I was at home
I was in a better place.

468
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:23,423
But travelers must be content.
- Ay.

469
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,340
Be so, good Touchstone.

470
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:17,556
O Corin.

471
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,924
That thou knew'st how I do love her.

472
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:25,173
I partly guess, for I
have loved ere now.

473
00:36:26,237 --> 00:36:31,317
How many actions most ridiculous hast
thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

474
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,131
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.

475
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,777
O, thou didst then
never love so heartily.

476
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,097
If thou remember not the slightest folly
that ever love did make thee run into.

477
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:46,730
Thou hast not loved.

478
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:51,454
Or if thou hast not spoke as I do now.

479
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,777
Wearing thy hearer
with thy mistress' praise.

480
00:36:55,543 --> 00:36:57,114
Thou hast not loved.

481
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:01,902
Or if thou hast not broke from company.

482
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:04,623
Abruptly, as my passion now make me.

483
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,533
Thou hast not loved.

484
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:09,936
O Phoebe.

485
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:11,952
Phoebe.

486
00:37:12,835 --> 00:37:14,179
Phoebe.

487
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:17,275
O Jove, Jove.

488
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:22,467
This shepherd's passion
is much upon my fashion.

489
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:24,542
And mine.

490
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:27,514
But it grows somewhat stale with me.

491
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:28,771
I pray you.

492
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,588
One of you question yond man if
he for gold will give us any food.

493
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,990
I faint almost to death.

494
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,839
Holla, you clown.

495
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:44,283
Peace, fool. He is not thy kinsman.

496
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:46,345
Who calls?

497
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,026
Good morrow, to you friend.

498
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,079
And to you, gentle sir.

499
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:52,573
And to you all.

500
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:55,140
I prithee, shepherd.

501
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:59,495
If that love or gold can in this
desert place buy entertainment.

502
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:01,420
Here's a young maid.

503
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:03,315
With travel much oppressed.

504
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:05,361
And faints for succor.

505
00:38:05,808 --> 00:38:07,450
Fair sir, I pity her.

506
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:12,022
But I am shepherd to another man and
do not shear the fleeces that I graze.

507
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:16,046
His cote, his flocks, and bounds
of feed are now on sale.

508
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:18,252
But what is, come and see.

509
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:21,022
And in my voice, most
welcome shall you be.

510
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:22,404
I pray thee.

511
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:26,018
If it stand with honesty, buy thou
the cottage, pasture, and the flock.

512
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:28,177
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.

513
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:32,503
I like this place and willingly
would waste my time in it.

514
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:35,628
Assuredly the thing is to be sold.

515
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:37,459
Go with me.

516
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:42,708
And if you like, upon report the soil,
the profit and this kind of life.

517
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:45,755
I will your very faithful feeder be.

518
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:06,431
Why, how now, monsieur?

519
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:10,920
What a life is this that your poor
friends must woo your company?

520
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:16,243
You look merrily. A fool, a fool.

521
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:19,042
I met a fool i' th' forest.

522
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,562
A motley fool.

523
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:24,913
A miserable world.

524
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:28,565
As I do live by food, I met a fool.

525
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:32,219
Who laid him down and
basked him in the sun.

526
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:35,088
And railed on Lady
Fortune in good terms.

527
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:36,721
In good set terms.

528
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,085
And yet a motley fool.

529
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,034
'Good morrow, fool', quoth I.

530
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:45,696
'No, sir', quoth he.

531
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:48,814
'Call me not 'fool' till
heaven hath sent me fortune'.

532
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:54,387
And then he drew a dial from his poke.

533
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:57,689
And looking on it with lack-luster eye.

534
00:39:58,368 --> 00:39:59,586
Says very wisely:

535
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,411
'It is ten o'clock'.

536
00:40:02,408 --> 00:40:04,012
'Thus we may see', quoth he.

537
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:06,102
'How the world wags'.

538
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:08,914
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine.

539
00:40:09,778 --> 00:40:12,318
And after one hour
more 'twill be eleven.

540
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:15,987
And so from hour to
hour we ripe and ripe.

541
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,770
And then from hour to
hour we rot and rot.

542
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,676
And thereby hangs a tale.

543
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,853
A noble fool. A worthy fool.

544
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:30,417
Motley's the only wear.

545
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,432
What fool is this?
- O worthy fool.

546
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,950
Would that I were a fool.

547
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:39,724
I am ambitious for a motley coat.

548
00:40:41,553 --> 00:40:42,870
Forbear and eat no more.

549
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:47,956
Why, I have eat none yet.
- Nor shalt, till necessity be served.

550
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:51,300
Of what kind should this cock come of?
- Forbear I say.

551
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,274
He dies who touches any of this fruit
till I and my affairs are answerèd.

552
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,411
An you will not be answered with reason.

553
00:40:58,161 --> 00:40:59,247
I must die.

554
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:01,242
What would you have?

555
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:03,597
Your gentleness shall force ..

556
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:06,453
More than your force
move us to gentleness.

557
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:08,477
I almost die for food.

558
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:10,302
Let me have it.

559
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,622
Sit down and feed.

560
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:15,572
And welcome to our table.

561
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:21,978
Speak you so gently?

562
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:27,081
Pardon me, I pray you.

563
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,854
I thought that all things
had been savage here.

564
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,495
And therefore put I on the
countenance of stern commandment.

565
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:36,203
But whate'er you are.

566
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,668
If ever you have looked on better days.

567
00:41:39,194 --> 00:41:41,688
If ever been where bells
have knolled to church.

568
00:41:42,451 --> 00:41:44,307
If ever sat at any good man's feast.

569
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:50,051
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
to know what 'tis to pity and be pitied.

570
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,240
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be.

571
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,982
In the which hope I blush.

572
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:58,212
And hide my sword.

573
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:01,850
True is it that we
have seen better days.

574
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:04,938
And have with holy bell
been knolled to church.

575
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,057
And sat at good men's feasts.

576
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,475
And wiped our eyes of drops.

577
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:12,112
That sacred pity hath engendered.

578
00:42:13,026 --> 00:42:13,875
Therefore.

579
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:16,388
Sit you down in gentleness.

580
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,875
Yet but forbear your
food a little while.

581
00:42:19,222 --> 00:42:20,436
There is a poor old man.

582
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:23,737
Who, after me hath many a
weary step limped in pure love.

583
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:28,925
Till he be first sufficed, oppressed
with two weak evils, age and hunger.

584
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:30,754
I will not touch a bit.

585
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:32,175
Go seek him out.

586
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:34,738
And we will nothing
waste until your return.

587
00:42:34,963 --> 00:42:35,851
I thank you.

588
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:38,225
And be blessed for your good comfort.

589
00:42:40,755 --> 00:42:43,644
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.

590
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:46,569
This wide and universal
theater presents ..

591
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:49,190
More woeful pageants than the scene ..

592
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,194
Wherein we play in.

593
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:54,811
All of the world's a stage.

594
00:42:57,112 --> 00:42:58,452
And all the men and women.

595
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,173
Merely players.

596
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,327
They have their exits
and their entrances.

597
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:06,370
And one man in his
time plays many parts.

598
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,913
His acts being ..

599
00:43:10,149 --> 00:43:11,306
Seven ages.

600
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,362
At first .. the infant.

601
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:18,451
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.

602
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:24,592
Then the whining schoolboy with his
satchel and shining morning face.

603
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:28,683
Creeping like snail
unwillingly to school.

604
00:43:31,118 --> 00:43:32,607
And then the lover.

605
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:35,598
Sighing like furnace.

606
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:39,975
With a woeful ballad made
to his mistress' eyebrow.

607
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:43,751
Then a soldier.

608
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:48,461
Full of strange oaths and
bearded like the pard.

609
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,486
Jealous in honor.
Sudden and quick in quarrel.

610
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:54,361
Seeking the bubble reputation.

611
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:56,587
Even in the cannon's mouth.

612
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:00,409
And then.

613
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:05,420
In fair round belly.

614
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:07,706
With good capon lined.

615
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:11,734
With eyes severe and
beard of formal cut.

616
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:14,663
Full of wise saws and modern instances.

617
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:16,706
And so he plays his part.

618
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:19,783
The sixth age.

619
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:23,735
Shifts into the lean and
slippered pantaloon.

620
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:26,892
With spectacles on nose
and pouch on side.

621
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:29,834
His youthful hose, well saved.

622
00:44:30,465 --> 00:44:33,249
A world too wide for his shrunk shank.

623
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:35,873
And his big manly voice.

624
00:44:36,598 --> 00:44:39,331
Turning again toward childish treble.

625
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:43,569
Pipes and whistles in his sound.

626
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,026
Last scene of all.

627
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:54,959
That ends this strange eventful history.

628
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,795
Is second childishness.

629
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,562
And mere.

630
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:01,381
Oblivion.

631
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,582
Sans teeth.

632
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:06,654
Sans eyes.

633
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:09,014
Sans taste.

634
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:11,738
Sans.

635
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:15,035
Everything.

636
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:55,976
If that you were the
good Sir Rowland's son.

637
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:58,300
As you have whispered
faithfully you were.

638
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,948
Be truly welcome hither.

639
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:01,307
Good old man.

640
00:46:01,748 --> 00:46:03,809
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.

641
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:05,887
I am the duke.

642
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,024
That loved your father.

643
00:46:14,717 --> 00:46:15,956
Not see him since?

644
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:18,863
Sir, sir, that cannot be.

645
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:20,437
But look to it:

646
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,444
Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is.

647
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:26,405
Seek him with candle. Bring him dead
or living within this twelvemonth.

648
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:29,598
Or turn thou no more to seek
a living in our territory.

649
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:31,403
Thy lands.

650
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:36,758
And all things that thou dost call thine
worth seizure, do we seize in our hands.

651
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:41,359
Till thou can quit thee by thy brother's
mouth of what we think against thee.

652
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:43,862
O, that your Highness
knew my heart in this:

653
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:46,499
I never loved my brother in my life.

654
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:49,584
More villain thou.

655
00:46:50,793 --> 00:46:52,198
Well, push him out of doors.

656
00:46:52,986 --> 00:46:57,043
And let my officers of such a nature
make an extent upon his house and lands.

657
00:46:58,062 --> 00:46:59,995
Do this expediently and turn him going.

658
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:24,616
Hang there my verse,
in witness of my love.

659
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:29,248
And thou, thrice-crownèd
queen of night ..

660
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:33,067
Survey with thy chaste eye,
from thy pale sphere above.

661
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,438
Thy huntress' name that
my full life doth sway.

662
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:41,124
O Rosalind.

663
00:47:42,073 --> 00:47:43,674
These trees shall be my books.

664
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:47,185
And in their barks my
thoughts I'll character.

665
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:52,815
That every eye which in the forest looks
can see thy virtue witnessed everywhere.

666
00:47:55,398 --> 00:47:56,027
Run.

667
00:47:56,905 --> 00:47:58,134
Run, Orlando.

668
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,878
Carve on every tree
the fair, the chaste.

669
00:48:04,104 --> 00:48:06,007
The unexpressive she.

670
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:46,538
'From the east to western Ind'.

671
00:49:47,422 --> 00:49:49,840
'No jewel is like Rosalind'.

672
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:54,245
'Her worth being mounted on the wind'.

673
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:58,056
'Through all the world bears Rosalind'.

674
00:49:59,098 --> 00:50:02,241
'All the pictures fairest lined'.

675
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:05,915
'Are but black to Rosalind'.

676
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:10,056
'Let no face be kept in mind'.

677
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,962
'But the fair of Rosalind'.

678
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:17,731
I'll rhyme you so eight years together.

679
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:20,141
Dinners and suppers and
sleeping hours excepted.

680
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,983
Out fool.
- For a taste.

681
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,301
If a hart do lack a hind.

682
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:27,689
Let him seek out Rosalind.

683
00:50:28,424 --> 00:50:29,086
Stop.

684
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:33,230
If the cat will after kind,
so be sure will Rosalind.

685
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:34,595
Stop fool.

686
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:36,642
Wintered garments must be lined..

687
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:38,830
So must slender Rosalind.

688
00:50:39,888 --> 00:50:42,221
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind.

689
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:44,468
Such a nut is Rosalind.

690
00:50:45,863 --> 00:50:50,339
He that sweetest rose will find,
must find love's prick and Rosalind.

691
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:52,428
Peace, you dull fool.

692
00:50:53,038 --> 00:50:56,442
This is the very false gallop of verses.
Why do you infect yourself with them?

693
00:50:57,396 --> 00:50:58,675
I found them on a tree.

694
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:01,634
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
- Peace.

695
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,854
'Helen's cheek, but not her heart'.

696
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:09,153
'Cleopatra's majesty'.

697
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:12,241
'Atalanta's better part'.

698
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:14,743
'Sad Lucretia's modesty'.

699
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,108
'Thus Rosalind of many parts'.

700
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:21,031
'By heavenly synod was devised'.

701
00:51:21,657 --> 00:51:24,278
'Of many faces, eyes, and hearts'.

702
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:27,741
'To have the touches dearest prized'.

703
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:31,702
'Heaven would that she
these gifts should have'.

704
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:35,383
'And I to live and die her slave'.

705
00:51:35,745 --> 00:51:38,509
O most gentle Jupiter.
- How now? Back, friends.

706
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:42,319
Shepherd, go off a little.

707
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:45,187
Shepherd, go off a little.

708
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:46,742
Go with him, sirrah.

709
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:55,151
Didst thou hear without wondering ..

710
00:51:55,385 --> 00:51:57,808
How thy name should be hanged
and carved upon these trees?

711
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:02,165
I was seven of the nine days out
of the wonder before you came.

712
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:04,863
For look here what I
found on a palm tree.

713
00:52:05,518 --> 00:52:09,330
I was never so berhymed
since Pythagoras' time.

714
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,915
When I was an Irish rat.

715
00:52:12,445 --> 00:52:14,312
Which I can hardly remember.

716
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,524
Trow you who hath done this?

717
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:18,124
Is it a man?

718
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:21,138
And a chain you once
wore about his neck.

719
00:52:22,795 --> 00:52:24,008
Change you color?

720
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:25,715
I prithee, who?

721
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,786
Is it possible?

722
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:31,487
Nay, I prithee now.
With most petitionary vehemence.

723
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:33,129
Tell me who it is.

724
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:37,624
O wonderful, wonderful.

725
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:41,600
And most wonderful, wonderful.
And yet again wonderful.

726
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:43,696
And after that out of all whooping.

727
00:52:44,058 --> 00:52:45,377
Good my complexion.

728
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,747
Dost thou think though I am
caparisoned like a man ..

729
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:49,772
I have a doublet and
hose in my disposition?

730
00:52:49,997 --> 00:52:53,481
One inch of delay more is
a South Sea of discovery.

731
00:52:53,845 --> 00:52:56,834
I prithee, speak apace.
I would thou couldst stammer.

732
00:52:57,393 --> 00:53:00,095
That thou might'st pour this
concealed man out of thy mouth.

733
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:02,392
As wine comes out of a
narrow-mouthed bottle.

734
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:04,486
Either too much at once or none at all.

735
00:53:04,994 --> 00:53:08,303
I prithee take the
cork out of thy mouth.

736
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:11,138
That I may drink thy tidings.

737
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:14,138
So you may put a man in your belly.
- What manner of man?

738
00:53:14,537 --> 00:53:17,122
Is his head worth a hat?
Or his chin worth a beard?

739
00:53:17,952 --> 00:53:18,581
Nay.

740
00:53:19,383 --> 00:53:20,755
He hath but a little beard.

741
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:23,717
Why, God will send more
if the man will be thankful.

742
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:28,326
Let me stay the growth of his beard, if
thou delay me not knowledge of his chin.

743
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:30,144
It is.

744
00:53:32,138 --> 00:53:33,800
Young ..
- Young who?

745
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,944
Orlando.

746
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:39,872
Orlando?

747
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:41,827
Orlando.

748
00:53:44,005 --> 00:53:45,962
Alas the day.

749
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:50,567
What shall I do with
my doublet and hose?

750
00:53:53,392 --> 00:53:55,123
What did he when thou saw'st him?

751
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,430
How looked he? Wherein went he?

752
00:53:59,828 --> 00:54:02,104
He asked for me?
When shalt thou see him again?

753
00:54:02,457 --> 00:54:03,904
Answer me in one word.

754
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:06,737
You must borrow me
Gargantua's mouth first.

755
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:10,817
But take a taste.

756
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:15,492
I found him under a tree.

757
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:17,325
Like a dropped acorn.

758
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,694
It may well be called Jove's tree.

759
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:22,834
When it drops forth such fruit.

760
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:27,835
There lay he, stretched
along like a wounded knight.

761
00:54:28,419 --> 00:54:30,539
Though it be pity to see such a sight.

762
00:54:31,232 --> 00:54:32,812
It well becomes the ground.

763
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:35,015
Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee.

764
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:36,832
Thou bring'st me out of tune.

765
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:45,109
Do you not know I am a woman?

766
00:54:45,538 --> 00:54:47,191
When I think, I must speak.

767
00:54:48,075 --> 00:54:50,247
Sweet, say on.
- You bring me out.

768
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:15,480
I thank you for your company.

769
00:55:15,844 --> 00:55:18,011
But good faith, I had as lief
have been myself alone.

770
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:19,156
And so had I.

771
00:55:19,546 --> 00:55:22,053
But yet for fashion sake I
thank you too for your society.

772
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:23,710
God be wi' you.

773
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:25,711
Let's meet as little as we can.

774
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,963
I do desire we may be better strangers.

775
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:29,701
I pray you ..

776
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:33,127
Mar no more trees with writing
love songs in their barks.

777
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,876
I pray you mar no more of my verses
with reading them ill-favoredly.

778
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:40,860
Rosalind is your love's name?
- Yes, just.

779
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,623
I do not like her name.

780
00:55:43,145 --> 00:55:45,507
There was no thought of pleasing
you when she was christened.

781
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,771
What stature is she of?
- Just as high as my heart.

782
00:55:50,998 --> 00:55:52,681
You are full of pretty answers.

783
00:55:53,368 --> 00:55:54,450
I am weary of you.

784
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:58,228
I'll tarry no longer with you.
Farewell, good Signior Love.

785
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:00,105
I am glad of your departure.

786
00:56:00,495 --> 00:56:02,029
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.

787
00:56:07,557 --> 00:56:08,884
Forester. Do you hear?

788
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,305
Very well. What would you?

789
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:16,084
I pray you, what is 't o'clock?

790
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,041
You should ask what time o' day.
There is no clock in the forest.

791
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:23,823
Then there is no true
lover in the forest.

792
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:26,234
Else sighing every minute.

793
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:29,026
And groaning every hour.

794
00:56:29,884 --> 00:56:33,074
Would detect the lazy foot
of time as well as a clock.

795
00:56:35,168 --> 00:56:36,637
Where dwell you, pretty youth?

796
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,087
With this shepherdess, my sister.

797
00:56:43,706 --> 00:56:46,993
Here in the skirts of the forest.
Like fringe upon a petticoat.

798
00:56:47,759 --> 00:56:51,207
Your accent is something finer than you
could purchase in so removed a dwelling.

799
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,860
I have been told so of many.

800
00:56:58,554 --> 00:57:01,521
But indeed, an old religious uncle
of mine taught me to speak.

801
00:57:02,843 --> 00:57:05,062
Who was in his youth an inland man.

802
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,119
One that knew courtship too well,
for there he fell in love.

803
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,808
I have heard him read
many lectures against it.

804
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:17,315
And I thank God I am not a woman to be
touched with so many giddy offenses.

805
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:21,208
Can you remember any of the principal
evils he laid to the charge of women?

806
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:24,499
I prithee recount some of them.
- No.

807
00:57:27,016 --> 00:57:28,915
I will not cast away my physic.

808
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,052
But on those that are sick.

809
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:35,276
There is a man.

810
00:57:36,092 --> 00:57:37,293
Haunts the forest.

811
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:40,822
That abuses our young plants.

812
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:44,572
With carving 'Rosalind' on their barks.

813
00:57:45,973 --> 00:57:48,820
Hangs odes upon hawthorns.

814
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:52,247
And elegies on brambles.

815
00:57:54,323 --> 00:57:55,992
And all forsooth.

816
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:59,915
Deifying the name of Rosalind.

817
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:05,431
If I could meet that fancy-monger
I would give him some good counsel.

818
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:09,152
For he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him.

819
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,774
I am he that is so love-shaked.

820
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:13,729
I pray you tell me your remedy.

821
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:20,646
There is none of my
uncle's marks upon you.

822
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:23,319
He taught me how to know a man in love.

823
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,284
What were his marks?

824
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:28,989
A lean cheek, which you have not.

825
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:31,199
A blue eye.

826
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,356
And sunken. Which you have not.

827
00:58:33,749 --> 00:58:35,879
A beard neglected. Which you have not.

828
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,151
Then your hose should be ungartered.

829
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,476
Your bonnet unbanded.

830
00:58:42,572 --> 00:58:44,726
Your sleeve unbuttoned.
Your shoe untied.

831
00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:49,980
And everything about you
demonstrating a careless desolation.

832
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:52,569
But you are no such man.

833
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:56,938
You are rather point-device
in your accouterments.

834
00:58:58,049 --> 00:59:01,051
As loving yourself than seeming
the lover of any other.

835
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:04,214
I swear to thee, youth, by
the white hand of Rosalind.

836
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:06,068
I am that he.

837
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:07,944
That unfortunate he.

838
00:59:08,383 --> 00:59:10,770
But are you so much in love
as your rhymes speak?

839
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:13,781
Neither rhyme nor reason
can express how much.

840
00:59:15,063 --> 00:59:15,725
Love.

841
00:59:16,174 --> 00:59:17,487
Is merely a madness.

842
00:59:18,344 --> 00:59:19,975
Yet I profess curing it by counsel.

843
00:59:20,878 --> 00:59:22,463
Did you ever cure any so?
- Yes.

844
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:23,847
One.

845
00:59:25,334 --> 00:59:26,580
And in this manner.

846
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:29,223
He was to imagine me his love.

847
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:30,612
His mistress.

848
00:59:31,102 --> 00:59:33,933
And I set him every day to woo me.

849
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:36,134
At which time, I.

850
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:38,444
Being but a moonish youth.

851
00:59:38,905 --> 00:59:41,378
Would now like him, now loathe him.

852
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,947
Then entertain him, then forswear him.

853
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,815
Now weep for him. Now spit at him.

854
00:59:47,265 --> 00:59:50,557
That I drave my suitor from
his mad humor of love.

855
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:53,521
Into a living humor of madness.

856
00:59:54,464 --> 00:59:55,780
And thus I cured him.

857
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:59,328
And this way will I take upon me.

858
00:59:59,783 --> 01:00:03,675
To wash your liver as clean
as a sound sheep's heart.

859
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,550
That there shall not be
one spot of love in 't.

860
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,592
I would not be cured, youth.

861
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:11,890
I would cure you.

862
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:15,040
If you would but call me Rosalind.

863
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:17,925
And come every day to my cote.

864
01:00:18,588 --> 01:00:19,528
To woo me.

865
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,520
Now, by the faith of my love, I will.

866
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,512
Tell me where it is.

867
01:00:24,737 --> 01:00:26,336
Go with me and I will show it you.

868
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:29,520
And by the way, you can tell me
where in the forest you live.

869
01:00:30,198 --> 01:00:31,086
Will you go?

870
01:00:31,633 --> 01:00:33,016
With all my heart, good youth.

871
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,172
Nay.

872
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,800
You must call me 'Rosalind'.

873
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:40,724
Rosalind.

874
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:44,278
Come, sister. Will you go?

875
01:00:50,742 --> 01:00:53,884
<i>And therefore take the present time</i>.

876
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,444
<i>With a hey, and a ho,
and a hey-nonny-no</i>.

877
01:00:59,227 --> 01:01:02,600
<i>For love is crownèd with the prime</i>.

878
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,649
<i>In springtime, in springtime</i>.

879
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:10,561
<i>The only pretty ring time</i>.

880
01:01:11,128 --> 01:01:14,067
<i>When birds do sing,
hey ding a ding, ding</i>.

881
01:01:14,622 --> 01:01:16,532
<i>Hey ding a ding, ding</i>.

882
01:01:16,947 --> 01:01:20,104
<i>Sweet lovers love the spring</i>.

883
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:23,519
And how, Audrey? Am I the man yet?

884
01:01:24,073 --> 01:01:26,512
Doth my simple feature content you?

885
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:29,767
Lord warrant us. What features?

886
01:01:32,028 --> 01:01:34,697
Truly, I would the gods
had made thee poetical.

887
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:38,299
I do not know what 'poetical' is.

888
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:43,866
Is it honest in word and deed?

889
01:01:44,299 --> 01:01:48,370
Nay, truly. For the truest
poetry is the most feigning.

890
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:50,948
Do you wish then, that
the gods had made me ..

891
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:52,799
Poetical?

892
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:54,432
I do, truly.

893
01:01:54,857 --> 01:01:56,834
For thou swear'st to me thou art honest.

894
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,113
Now, if thou wert a poet ..

895
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:02,512
I might have some hope thou didst feign.

896
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:05,087
Would you not have me honest?

897
01:02:05,665 --> 01:02:06,819
Nay, Truly.

898
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:09,986
Unless thou wert hard-favored.

899
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:19,371
Never talk to me. I will weep.

900
01:02:20,438 --> 01:02:21,390
Do, I prithee.

901
01:02:22,934 --> 01:02:26,160
But yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man.

902
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:28,344
But have I not cause to weep?

903
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,953
As good a cause as one would desire.

904
01:02:31,459 --> 01:02:32,444
Therefore weep.

905
01:02:33,037 --> 01:02:34,030
His very hair.

906
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,442
Is of the dissembling color.

907
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,825
Even browner than Judas's.

908
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:42,001
Marry, his kisses are
Judas's own children.

909
01:02:42,414 --> 01:02:43,819
His hair is of a good color.

910
01:02:44,926 --> 01:02:46,040
An excellent color.

911
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,726
Your chestnut was ever the only color.

912
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:52,406
And his kissing is
as full of sanctity ..

913
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,797
As the touch of holy bread.

914
01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:57,526
The very ice of chastity is in them.

915
01:02:57,992 --> 01:03:02,811
But why, why did he swear he would
come this morning, and comes not?

916
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:05,848
Nay. Certainly, there's no truth in him.

917
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,755
Not true in love?

918
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,586
Yes, when he is in.

919
01:03:10,223 --> 01:03:11,531
But I think he is not in.

920
01:03:11,861 --> 01:03:13,870
You have heard him
swear downright he was.

921
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,643
'Was' is not 'is'.

922
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:20,638
Besides, the oath of a lover is no
stronger than the word of a tapster.

923
01:03:25,115 --> 01:03:27,796
He attends here in the forest
on the Duke your father.

924
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:36,477
<i>What shall he have that killed the deer?</i>

925
01:03:37,065 --> 01:03:39,517
<i>His leather skin and horns to wear</i>.

926
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:42,514
<i>Take thou no scorn to wear the horn</i>.

927
01:03:43,058 --> 01:03:45,671
<i>It was a crest ere thou wast born</i>.

928
01:03:46,016 --> 01:03:48,625
<i>Thy father's father wore it</i>.

929
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,633
<i>And thy father bore it</i>.

930
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:54,328
<i>The horn, the horn, the lusty horn</i>.

931
01:03:54,787 --> 01:03:56,712
I met the Duke yesterday.

932
01:03:57,945 --> 01:04:00,206
He asked me of what parentage I was.

933
01:04:02,733 --> 01:04:05,593
I told him, of as good as he.

934
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:08,573
He laughed and let me go.

935
01:04:10,136 --> 01:04:11,731
But what talk we of fathers ..

936
01:04:12,773 --> 01:04:15,631
When there is such a man as Orlando?

937
01:04:16,433 --> 01:04:17,957
Mistress and master.

938
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:22,292
If you will see a pageant truly played.

939
01:04:22,777 --> 01:04:25,533
Between the pale
complexion of true love.

940
01:04:25,996 --> 01:04:29,096
And the red glow of
scorn and proud disdain.

941
01:04:29,724 --> 01:04:30,911
Go hence a little.

942
01:04:31,341 --> 01:04:33,493
And I shall conduct you.
- O come.

943
01:04:34,424 --> 01:04:35,500
Let us remove.

944
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:39,549
The sight of lovers
feedeth those in love.

945
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:47,979
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Do not, Phoebe.

946
01:04:49,706 --> 01:04:52,589
Say that you love me not,
but say not so In bitterness.

947
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:55,278
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.

948
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:58,023
Thou tell'st me there
is murder in mine eye.

949
01:04:58,755 --> 01:05:00,450
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable.

950
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:04,548
And if mine eyes can wound,
now let them kill thee.

951
01:05:05,262 --> 01:05:07,103
Now counterfeit to swoon.

952
01:05:07,674 --> 01:05:09,238
Why, now fall down.

953
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,529
Or if thou canst not.

954
01:05:12,217 --> 01:05:14,267
O, for shame, for shame.

955
01:05:14,797 --> 01:05:17,000
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.

956
01:05:17,629 --> 01:05:19,446
O dear Phoebe. If ever ..

957
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:21,166
As that ever may be near.

958
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,465
You meet in some fresh
cheek the power of fancy.

959
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:28,845
Then shall you know the wounds
invisible that love's keen arrows make.

960
01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:31,168
But till that time,
come not thou near me.

961
01:05:32,107 --> 01:05:34,917
And when that time comes,
afflict me with thy mocks.

962
01:05:35,491 --> 01:05:36,379
Pity me not.

963
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:39,144
Until that time I shall not pity thee.

964
01:05:40,681 --> 01:05:42,647
And why, I pray you?

965
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:46,808
Who might be your mother.
That you insult, exult.

966
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:48,780
And all at once over the wretched?

967
01:05:49,928 --> 01:05:52,908
What, though you have no beauty.

968
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,546
Must you therefore be
proud and pitiless?

969
01:05:58,029 --> 01:05:58,901
Why.

970
01:05:59,991 --> 01:06:01,267
What means this?

971
01:06:02,529 --> 01:06:03,996
Why do you look on me?

972
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,628
'Od's my little life.

973
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:10,623
I think she means to
tangle my eyes, too.

974
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,450
No faith, proud mistress.

975
01:06:15,419 --> 01:06:16,874
Hope not after it.

976
01:06:17,735 --> 01:06:21,188
'Tis not your inky brows,
your black silk hair.

977
01:06:21,646 --> 01:06:25,798
Your bugle eyeballs,
nor your cheek of cream.

978
01:06:26,432 --> 01:06:28,809
That can entame my spirits.

979
01:06:29,696 --> 01:06:30,734
To your worship.

980
01:06:31,516 --> 01:06:32,786
You foolish shepherd.

981
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:38,356
Wherefore do you follow her, like foggy
south puffing with wind and rain?

982
01:06:38,944 --> 01:06:42,138
You are a thousand times a
properer man than she a woman.

983
01:06:42,852 --> 01:06:46,210
'Tis not her glass but
you that flatters her.

984
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:50,751
But mistress, know yourself.
Down on your knees.

985
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,845
Thank heaven, fasting.
For a good man's love.

986
01:06:55,505 --> 01:06:59,110
For I must tell you
friendly in your ear.

987
01:06:59,955 --> 01:07:01,663
Sell when you can.

988
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:03,988
You are not for all markets.

989
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:08,353
So take her to thee, shepherd.

990
01:07:09,272 --> 01:07:10,273
Fare you well.

991
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:13,955
Sweet youth, I pray you
chide a year together.

992
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:17,171
I had rather hear you
chide than this man woo.

993
01:07:19,362 --> 01:07:21,831
I pray you do not fall in love with me.

994
01:07:22,582 --> 01:07:26,182
For I am falser than vows made in wine.

995
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:28,432
Besides.

996
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:30,508
I like you not.

997
01:07:30,995 --> 01:07:32,771
Come, sister. Let us go.

998
01:07:44,997 --> 01:07:46,725
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.

999
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,521
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.

1000
01:08:07,406 --> 01:08:08,713
Why, how now, Orlando.

1001
01:08:09,973 --> 01:08:11,648
Where have you been all this while?

1002
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,327
You a lover?

1003
01:08:15,242 --> 01:08:18,654
An you serve me such another trick,
never come in my sight anymore.

1004
01:08:19,824 --> 01:08:22,130
My fair Rosalind, I come
within an hour of my promise.

1005
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:25,282
Break an hour's promise in love?

1006
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:30,580
He that will divide a minute
into a thousand parts.

1007
01:08:31,145 --> 01:08:35,379
And break but a part of a thousandth
part of a minute in the affairs of love.

1008
01:08:36,407 --> 01:08:39,192
It may be said of him that Cupid
hath clapped him o' th' shoulder.

1009
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:41,486
But I'll warrant him heart-whole.

1010
01:08:42,157 --> 01:08:43,393
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

1011
01:08:43,618 --> 01:08:44,294
Nay.

1012
01:08:45,175 --> 01:08:48,034
An you be so tardy,
come no more in my sight.

1013
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,044
I had as lief be wooed of a snail.

1014
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:52,928
Of a snail?

1015
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:54,866
Ay, of a snail.

1016
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:59,600
For though he comes slowly,
he carries his house on his head.

1017
01:09:00,496 --> 01:09:02,855
A better jointure, I think,
than you make a woman.

1018
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:07,691
Besides, he brings his destiny with him.

1019
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:08,941
What's that?

1020
01:09:12,841 --> 01:09:13,836
Horns.

1021
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:16,894
Virtue is no hornmaker.
And my Rosalind is virtuous.

1022
01:09:17,335 --> 01:09:18,931
And I am your Rosalind.

1023
01:09:19,561 --> 01:09:20,471
Come, woo me.

1024
01:09:20,696 --> 01:09:21,521
Woo me.

1025
01:09:21,987 --> 01:09:25,563
For now I am in a holiday humor
and like enough to consent.

1026
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,029
What would you say to me now?

1027
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:32,200
An I were your very, very Rosalind?

1028
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:34,551
I would kiss before I spoke.

1029
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,119
Nay.

1030
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:40,831
You were better speak first.

1031
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,576
Very good orators, when
they are out, they will spit.

1032
01:09:46,855 --> 01:09:48,639
And for lovers lacking matter.

1033
01:09:49,129 --> 01:09:50,602
The cleanliest shift is to kiss.

1034
01:09:50,964 --> 01:09:53,063
Who could be out, being
before his beloved mistress?

1035
01:09:53,446 --> 01:09:56,529
Marry, that should you
if I were your mistress.

1036
01:09:57,649 --> 01:09:59,010
Am not I your Rosalind?

1037
01:09:59,339 --> 01:10:01,838
I take some joy to say you are
because I would be talking of her.

1038
01:10:02,256 --> 01:10:04,704
Well .. and in her person.

1039
01:10:05,684 --> 01:10:06,718
I say.

1040
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:08,833
I will not have you.

1041
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,885
Then, in mine own person I die.

1042
01:10:11,266 --> 01:10:12,120
No, faith.

1043
01:10:12,814 --> 01:10:14,172
Die by attorney.

1044
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,475
The poor world.
It is almost six thousand years old.

1045
01:10:17,954 --> 01:10:21,975
And in all this time there was not
any man died in his own person.

1046
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:23,668
In a love cause.

1047
01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:27,387
Men have died from time to time.

1048
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,598
And worms have eaten
them from time to time.

1049
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:33,649
But not for love.

1050
01:10:34,504 --> 01:10:36,406
I would not have my right
Rosalind of this mind.

1051
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:38,359
For I protest her frown might kill me.

1052
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:41,497
By this hand.

1053
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,104
It will not kill a fly.

1054
01:10:45,643 --> 01:10:46,434
But come.

1055
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,128
Now I will be your Rosalind in
a more coming-on disposition.

1056
01:10:50,732 --> 01:10:53,117
And ask me what you will.

1057
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:56,677
I will grant it.
- Then love me, Rosalind.

1058
01:10:57,506 --> 01:10:58,361
Yes, faith.

1059
01:10:58,646 --> 01:10:59,372
Will I.

1060
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,787
Fridays, Saturdays, and all days.

1061
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,272
And wilt thou have me?
- Ay.

1062
01:11:05,715 --> 01:11:07,792
And twenty such.
- What sayest thou?

1063
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:09,529
Are you not good?

1064
01:11:09,754 --> 01:11:10,577
I hope so.

1065
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:14,077
Why then, can one desire
too much of a good thing?

1066
01:11:15,123 --> 01:11:16,754
Sister. Sister.

1067
01:11:17,123 --> 01:11:19,314
You shall be the priest and marry us.

1068
01:11:22,785 --> 01:11:24,361
Give me your hand, Orlando.

1069
01:11:24,969 --> 01:11:26,988
What do you say, sister?
- Pray thee marry us.

1070
01:11:27,848 --> 01:11:29,091
I cannot say the words.

1071
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:32,133
You must begin.

1072
01:11:32,697 --> 01:11:34,761
'Will you, Orlando ..'

1073
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:37,370
'Have to wife this Rosalind'?

1074
01:11:37,731 --> 01:11:38,425
Go to.

1075
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:44,233
Will you, Orlando, have
to wife this Rosalind?

1076
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:45,983
I will.
- Ay, but when?

1077
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:47,903
Why now, as fast as she can marry us.

1078
01:11:48,427 --> 01:11:51,835
Then you must say:
'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife'.

1079
01:11:54,219 --> 01:11:56,221
I take thee Rosalind, for wife.

1080
01:11:57,454 --> 01:11:59,472
I do take thee, Orlando.

1081
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:01,312
For my husband.

1082
01:12:08,017 --> 01:12:09,250
Now tell me, Orlando.

1083
01:12:09,994 --> 01:12:13,353
How long would you have her
after you have possessed her?

1084
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:15,513
Forever and a day.

1085
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:17,829
Say 'a day' without the 'ever'.

1086
01:12:18,385 --> 01:12:19,596
O no, Orlando.

1087
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:22,541
Men are April when they woo.

1088
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,029
And December when they wed.

1089
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:28,481
Maids are May when they are maids.

1090
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:32,376
But the sky changes when they are wives.

1091
01:12:32,926 --> 01:12:34,300
But will my Rosalind do so?

1092
01:12:34,525 --> 01:12:36,059
By my life, she will do as I do.

1093
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:38,068
O, but she is wise.

1094
01:12:39,268 --> 01:12:40,598
She is wise.

1095
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,737
But the wiser, the waywarder.

1096
01:12:44,397 --> 01:12:46,513
For these two hours, Rosalind,
I will leave thee.

1097
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,636
Alas, dear love.

1098
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:51,218
I cannot lack thee two hours.

1099
01:12:51,579 --> 01:12:54,470
I must attend the Duke at dinner.
By two o'clock I'll be with thee again.

1100
01:12:55,602 --> 01:12:56,199
Ay.

1101
01:12:56,694 --> 01:12:58,643
Go your ways. Go your ways.

1102
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,764
I knew what you would prove.

1103
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:04,695
My friends told me as much.

1104
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:07,175
And I thought no less.

1105
01:13:09,382 --> 01:13:12,551
That flattering tongue of yours won me.

1106
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,162
'Tis but one more cast away.

1107
01:13:17,297 --> 01:13:19,326
And so come, death.

1108
01:13:22,647 --> 01:13:23,955
Two o'clock is your hour?

1109
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:27,429
By my troth, and in good earnest.

1110
01:13:28,343 --> 01:13:31,695
And so God mend me, and by all
pretty oaths that are not dangerous.

1111
01:13:32,331 --> 01:13:36,452
If you break but one jot of your promise
or come one minute behind your hour.

1112
01:13:36,911 --> 01:13:40,913
I will think you the most pathetical
break-promise and the most hollow lover.

1113
01:13:41,357 --> 01:13:43,755
And the most unworthy of
her you call Rosalind.

1114
01:13:44,547 --> 01:13:46,650
Therefore, beware and keep your promise.

1115
01:13:47,037 --> 01:13:49,476
With no less religion than if
thou wert indeed my Rosalind.

1116
01:13:50,062 --> 01:13:51,625
So, adieu.
- Adieu.

1117
01:14:00,619 --> 01:14:01,903
Adieu.

1118
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:03,833
Adieu.

1119
01:14:09,586 --> 01:14:11,149
At two.

1120
01:14:12,049 --> 01:14:13,174
Two o'clock.

1121
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:20,065
At two o'clock.

1122
01:14:21,473 --> 01:14:22,546
Two o'clock.

1123
01:14:25,992 --> 01:14:28,455
At two o'clock.

1124
01:14:29,658 --> 01:14:32,064
At two. At two.

1125
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,798
Two o'clock.

1126
01:14:37,257 --> 01:14:40,236
At two o'clock. At two o'clock.

1127
01:14:41,946 --> 01:14:46,241
You have simply misused
our sex in your love-prate.

1128
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:48,490
O coz, coz, coz.

1129
01:14:48,848 --> 01:14:50,780
My pretty little coz.

1130
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:53,007
That thou didst know.

1131
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:56,760
How many fathoms deep I am in love.

1132
01:14:57,877 --> 01:15:00,129
O but it cannot be sounded.

1133
01:15:00,759 --> 01:15:04,044
My affection hath an unknown bottom.

1134
01:15:04,658 --> 01:15:07,394
Like the Bay of Portugal.

1135
01:15:08,948 --> 01:15:10,925
I'll tell thee, Aliena.

1136
01:15:11,454 --> 01:15:14,257
I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando.

1137
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:16,154
So I'll go.

1138
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,396
Find a shadow.

1139
01:15:19,588 --> 01:15:22,946
And sigh till he come.

1140
01:15:26,309 --> 01:15:27,294
And I'll sleep.

1141
01:16:21,897 --> 01:16:27,207
<i>Tell me where is fancy bred.
Or in the heart or in the head</i>.

1142
01:16:27,645 --> 01:16:29,813
<i>How begot, how nourishèd?</i>

1143
01:16:30,817 --> 01:16:32,233
<i>Reply, reply</i>.

1144
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:37,635
<i>It is engender'd in the eyes
with gazing fed and Fancy dies</i>.

1145
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:40,184
<i>In the cradle where it lies</i>.

1146
01:16:40,748 --> 01:16:42,352
<i>Let us all ring Fancy's knell:</i>

1147
01:16:42,782 --> 01:16:45,837
<i>I'll begin it, ding-dong bell</i>.

1148
01:16:46,825 --> 01:16:50,396
<i>Ding-dong, ding-dong bell</i>.

1149
01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:54,115
What say you now?

1150
01:16:55,786 --> 01:16:57,335
Is it not past two o'clock?

1151
01:16:57,931 --> 01:16:59,394
And here much Orlando.

1152
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:00,962
I warrant you.

1153
01:17:01,307 --> 01:17:04,308
With pure love and troubled brain
he hath ta'en his bow and arrows.

1154
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:06,531
And has gone forth to sleep.

1155
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:09,228
Good morrow, fair ones.

1156
01:17:09,643 --> 01:17:11,338
Are you not the owners of this house?

1157
01:17:12,898 --> 01:17:14,925
It is no boast, being
asked to say we are.

1158
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:23,323
Orlando doth commend him to you both.

1159
01:17:24,638 --> 01:17:26,430
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind.

1160
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,349
He sends this blood-stained napkin.

1161
01:17:28,801 --> 01:17:29,656
Are you he?

1162
01:17:30,473 --> 01:17:31,216
I am.

1163
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:34,096
What must we understand by this?

1164
01:17:34,906 --> 01:17:35,955
Some of my shame.

1165
01:17:36,263 --> 01:17:37,943
If you will know of me what man I am.

1166
01:17:38,168 --> 01:17:40,288
And how and why and where
this handkercher was stained.

1167
01:17:40,513 --> 01:17:41,627
I pray you tell it.

1168
01:17:42,227 --> 01:17:44,128
When last the young
Orlando parted from you.

1169
01:17:44,353 --> 01:17:46,501
He left a promise to return
again within the hour.

1170
01:17:47,353 --> 01:17:49,692
And pacing through the forest.
Lo, what befell.

1171
01:17:50,169 --> 01:17:51,089
Under an oak.

1172
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,530
A wretched, ragged man
lay sleeping on his back.

1173
01:17:54,266 --> 01:17:57,092
About his neck a green and gilded
snake had wreathed itself.

1174
01:17:57,742 --> 01:18:00,958
Suddenly, seeing Orlando, it unlinked
itself and slipped away into a bush.

1175
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:04,427
Under which bush's shade,
a lioness lay couching.

1176
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:06,437
Head on ground, with catlike watch.

1177
01:18:06,863 --> 01:18:08,623
When that the sleeping man should stir.

1178
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,043
This seen.

1179
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:11,864
Orlando did approach the man.

1180
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:13,771
And found it was his brother.

1181
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:15,942
His elder brother.

1182
01:18:16,582 --> 01:18:18,770
O, I have heard him speak
of that same brother.

1183
01:18:19,169 --> 01:18:22,047
And he did render him the most
unnatural that lived amongst men.

1184
01:18:22,957 --> 01:18:24,232
And well he might so do.

1185
01:18:25,057 --> 01:18:26,791
For well I know, he was unnatural.

1186
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:28,624
But for Orlando?

1187
01:18:29,278 --> 01:18:30,521
Did he leave him there?

1188
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:32,701
Twice did he turn his
back and purposed so.

1189
01:18:33,181 --> 01:18:35,696
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge.

1190
01:18:36,302 --> 01:18:39,000
Made him give battle to the lioness.
Which quickly fell before him.

1191
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:42,029
In which hurtling, from
miserable slumber I awaked.

1192
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,983
Are you his brother?
- Was 't you he rescued?

1193
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:48,194
Was 't you that did so
oft contrive to kill him?

1194
01:18:48,419 --> 01:18:49,177
'Twas I.

1195
01:18:49,711 --> 01:18:50,696
But 'tis not I.

1196
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,603
I do not shame to tell you what I was.

1197
01:18:54,211 --> 01:18:57,256
Since my conversion so sweetly
tastes being the thing I am.

1198
01:18:59,463 --> 01:19:00,944
But for this bloody napkin?

1199
01:19:01,476 --> 01:19:02,364
Bye and bye.

1200
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:05,302
When from the first to
last betwixt us two.

1201
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:07,902
Tears our recountments
had most kindly bathed.

1202
01:19:08,378 --> 01:19:11,807
As how I came into that desert place.
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke.

1203
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,169
Who gave me fresh array
and entertainment.

1204
01:19:14,465 --> 01:19:16,160
Committing me unto my brother's love.

1205
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:19,430
Who led me instantly unto his cave.
There stripped himself.

1206
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:21,185
And here upon his arm.

1207
01:19:21,774 --> 01:19:23,363
The lioness had torn some flesh away.

1208
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:25,191
Which all this while had bled.

1209
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:27,057
And now he fainted.

1210
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,059
And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.

1211
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,570
Why, how now, Ganymede.

1212
01:19:32,983 --> 01:19:33,968
Sweet Ganymede.

1213
01:19:34,285 --> 01:19:36,044
Many will swoon when
they do look on blood.

1214
01:19:36,269 --> 01:19:37,770
There is more in it. Cousin.

1215
01:19:38,175 --> 01:19:38,966
Ganymede.

1216
01:19:39,597 --> 01:19:40,679
Look, he recovers.

1217
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:50,393
I would I were at home.

1218
01:19:51,402 --> 01:19:52,645
We'll lead you thither.

1219
01:19:52,911 --> 01:19:54,871
I pray you, will you
take him by the arm?

1220
01:19:56,238 --> 01:19:57,513
Be of good cheer, youth.

1221
01:19:57,978 --> 01:19:58,854
You a man?

1222
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:01,002
You lack a man's heart.

1223
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:02,380
I do so.

1224
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:04,747
I confess it.

1225
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,028
I pray you, sir.

1226
01:20:09,697 --> 01:20:11,807
Tell your brother how
well I counterfeited.

1227
01:20:12,473 --> 01:20:13,748
This is not counterfeit.

1228
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:17,164
There is too great testimony in your
complexion. It was a passion of earnest.

1229
01:20:17,564 --> 01:20:19,300
Counterfeit, I assure you.

1230
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:22,525
Well then, take a good heart.

1231
01:20:22,835 --> 01:20:24,240
And counterfeit to be a man.

1232
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,378
So I will. I do.

1233
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:32,843
But, i' faith, I should have
been a woman by right.

1234
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,769
Come you. You look paler and paler.

1235
01:20:36,368 --> 01:20:37,643
Pray you draw homewards.

1236
01:20:38,073 --> 01:20:39,390
Good sir, go with us.

1237
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:41,095
That will I.

1238
01:20:47,947 --> 01:20:48,835
Counterfeit.

1239
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:50,472
I assure you.

1240
01:20:55,555 --> 01:20:56,490
Audrey.

1241
01:20:57,305 --> 01:21:00,398
There is a youth in the forest
here lays claim to you.

1242
01:21:00,993 --> 01:21:02,487
Ay, I know who 'tis.

1243
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:04,828
He hath no interest in me in the world.

1244
01:21:05,911 --> 01:21:07,484
Here comes the man you mean.

1245
01:21:08,093 --> 01:21:08,722
Aha.

1246
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:11,798
It is meat and drink to
me to meet a clown.

1247
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,024
We shall be flouting.

1248
01:21:14,512 --> 01:21:15,861
We cannot hold.

1249
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:21,414
Good ev'n, Audrey.

1250
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:23,580
God gi' good ev'n, William.

1251
01:21:28,023 --> 01:21:31,333
And good ev'n to you, sir.
- Good ev'n, gentle friend.

1252
01:21:31,938 --> 01:21:34,758
Cover thy head, cover thy head.
Nay, prithee. Be covered.

1253
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,195
How old are you, friend?

1254
01:21:37,817 --> 01:21:38,974
Five-and-twenty, sir.

1255
01:21:39,704 --> 01:21:40,559
A ripe age.

1256
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,946
Is thy name William?

1257
01:21:44,139 --> 01:21:45,208
William, sir.

1258
01:21:45,956 --> 01:21:46,844
A fair name.

1259
01:21:47,253 --> 01:21:48,976
Wast born i' th' forest here?

1260
01:21:49,658 --> 01:21:51,597
Ay, sir, I thank God.

1261
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:53,769
'Thank God'. A good answer.

1262
01:21:54,566 --> 01:21:55,636
Art thou wise?

1263
01:21:56,187 --> 01:21:58,254
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

1264
01:21:58,987 --> 01:22:00,553
Why, thou sayst well.

1265
01:22:01,264 --> 01:22:02,686
I do now remember a saying:

1266
01:22:03,013 --> 01:22:04,858
'The fool doth think he is wise'.

1267
01:22:05,584 --> 01:22:08,387
'But the wise man knows
himself to be a fool'.

1268
01:22:10,544 --> 01:22:12,114
You do love this maid?

1269
01:22:15,505 --> 01:22:16,517
I do, sir.

1270
01:22:17,222 --> 01:22:18,473
Give me your hand.

1271
01:22:20,073 --> 01:22:21,203
Art thou learned?

1272
01:22:22,036 --> 01:22:24,135
No, sir.
- Then learn this of me.

1273
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,935
To have is to have.

1274
01:22:26,338 --> 01:22:27,840
For it is a figure in rhetoric.

1275
01:22:28,074 --> 01:22:30,887
That drink, being poured
out of a cup into a glass.

1276
01:22:31,591 --> 01:22:33,747
By filling the one,
doth empty the other.

1277
01:22:34,224 --> 01:22:37,404
And all your writers do
consent that <i>ipse</i> is 'he'.

1278
01:22:37,991 --> 01:22:40,510
Now, you are not <i>he</i> for I am he.

1279
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:42,235
Which he, sir?

1280
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:44,203
He, sir, that must marry this woman.

1281
01:22:44,787 --> 01:22:45,993
Therefore, you clown.

1282
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:48,316
Abandon the society of this female.

1283
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:51,335
Or, clown, thou perishest.

1284
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:54,343
Or, to thy better understanding.

1285
01:22:54,915 --> 01:22:55,609
Diest.

1286
01:22:55,928 --> 01:22:57,463
Or, to wit, I kill thee.

1287
01:22:57,869 --> 01:22:58,868
Make thee away.

1288
01:22:59,294 --> 01:23:00,763
Translate thy life into death.

1289
01:23:01,258 --> 01:23:04,534
I will kill thee a
hundred and fifty ways.

1290
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:08,279
Therefore, tremble and depart.

1291
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:09,840
Do, good William.

1292
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:11,465
God rest you merry, sir.

1293
01:23:24,574 --> 01:23:26,657
Is 't possible that on so
little acquaintance ..

1294
01:23:27,107 --> 01:23:29,093
That, but seeing Aliena,
you should love her?

1295
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:31,510
And loving, woo?
And wooing, she should grant?

1296
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:34,531
Neither call in question my sudden
wooing, nor her sudden consenting.

1297
01:23:35,118 --> 01:23:37,248
But say with me: 'I love fair Aliena'.

1298
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:40,530
<i>Tell me where is fancy bred</i>.

1299
01:23:40,941 --> 01:23:43,695
<i>Or in the heart or in the head</i>.

1300
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:47,336
<i>How begot, how nourishèd?</i>

1301
01:23:55,182 --> 01:23:56,619
Let your wedding be tomorrow.

1302
01:23:57,045 --> 01:23:59,672
Thither will I invite the Duke
and all his contented followers.

1303
01:24:02,308 --> 01:24:03,655
Go you and prepare Aliena.

1304
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:15,794
God save you, brother.
- And you, fair sister.

1305
01:24:19,585 --> 01:24:22,848
O my dear Orlando, how it grieves me.

1306
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,459
To see thee wear thy heart in a scarf.

1307
01:24:25,988 --> 01:24:26,954
It is my arm.

1308
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,529
I thought thy heart had been
wounded by the claws of a lion.

1309
01:24:31,911 --> 01:24:33,833
Wounded it is.
But with the eyes of a lady.

1310
01:24:34,138 --> 01:24:36,625
Did your brother tell you how
I counterfeited to swoon ..

1311
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:38,420
When he showed me your handkercher?

1312
01:24:38,645 --> 01:24:41,718
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
- O, I know where you are.

1313
01:24:42,117 --> 01:24:44,919
Nay, 'tis true.
There was never anything so sudden.

1314
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:47,405
For your brother and my sister.

1315
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:52,164
They are in the very wrath of love,
and they will together.

1316
01:24:52,637 --> 01:24:54,060
Clubs cannot part them.

1317
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,134
They shall be married tomorrow.

1318
01:24:56,557 --> 01:24:58,317
And I will bid the Duke to the nuptial.

1319
01:24:59,953 --> 01:25:03,603
O, how bitter a thing it is to look into
happiness through another man's eyes.

1320
01:25:04,338 --> 01:25:07,303
By so much the more shall I tomorrow
be at the height of heart-heaviness.

1321
01:25:08,811 --> 01:25:12,149
By how much I shall think my brother
happy in having what he wishes for.

1322
01:25:12,948 --> 01:25:13,849
Why, then.

1323
01:25:14,937 --> 01:25:18,282
Tomorrow I cannot serve
your turn for Rosalind?

1324
01:25:22,049 --> 01:25:23,616
I can live no longer by thinking.

1325
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:27,807
I will weary you then no longer.

1326
01:25:28,349 --> 01:25:29,619
With idle talking.

1327
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,935
Know of me then.

1328
01:25:32,665 --> 01:25:34,746
That I can do strange things.

1329
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:37,614
I have.

1330
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,852
Since I was three years old.

1331
01:25:41,746 --> 01:25:43,967
Conversed .. with a magician.

1332
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:49,421
And if you do love Rosalind so near
the heart as your gesture cries it out.

1333
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,467
You shall marry her.

1334
01:25:51,829 --> 01:25:53,418
When your brother marries Aliena.

1335
01:25:53,945 --> 01:25:55,457
It is not impossible for me.

1336
01:25:55,894 --> 01:25:58,412
To set her before your eyes tomorrow.

1337
01:25:58,884 --> 01:26:00,330
Human as she is.

1338
01:26:00,796 --> 01:26:02,155
And without any danger.

1339
01:26:03,002 --> 01:26:04,471
Speak'st thou in sober meanings?

1340
01:26:04,813 --> 01:26:05,475
I do.

1341
01:26:06,173 --> 01:26:07,167
By my life.

1342
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:09,381
Which I tender dearly.

1343
01:26:10,044 --> 01:26:11,745
Though I say I am a magician.

1344
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,115
Therefore, put you on your best array.

1345
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,618
Bid your best friends.

1346
01:26:17,163 --> 01:26:19,553
For if you will be married
tomorrow, you shall.

1347
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,142
And to Rosalind.

1348
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,770
If you will.

1349
01:26:24,628 --> 01:26:26,936
Youth, you have done
me much ungentleness.

1350
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:28,780
I care not if I have.

1351
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:32,943
It is my study to seem despiteful
and ungentle to you.

1352
01:26:34,047 --> 01:26:36,068
You are there followed
by a faithful shepherd.

1353
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:37,485
Look upon him.

1354
01:26:37,888 --> 01:26:39,565
Love him. He worships you.

1355
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:42,937
Good shepherd, tell this
youth what 'tis to love.

1356
01:26:44,676 --> 01:26:47,849
It is to be all made of sighs and tears.

1357
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:50,925
And so am I for Phoebe.

1358
01:26:51,528 --> 01:26:53,079
And I for Ganymede.

1359
01:26:54,053 --> 01:26:55,219
And I for Rosalind.

1360
01:26:55,946 --> 01:26:57,763
And I for no woman.

1361
01:26:58,587 --> 01:27:01,904
It is to be all made
of faith and service.

1362
01:27:02,732 --> 01:27:03,978
And so am I for Phoebe.

1363
01:27:04,369 --> 01:27:06,103
And I for Ganymede.

1364
01:27:07,231 --> 01:27:08,345
And I for Rosalind.

1365
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:10,971
And I for no woman.

1366
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:14,244
It is to be all made of fantasy.

1367
01:27:14,905 --> 01:27:17,553
All made of passion and
all made of wishes.

1368
01:27:18,382 --> 01:27:20,605
All adoration, duty, and observance.

1369
01:27:21,114 --> 01:27:23,135
All humbleness, all patience.

1370
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:24,679
And impatience.

1371
01:27:25,446 --> 01:27:28,584
All purity, all trial and all obedience.

1372
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:31,713
And so am I for Phoebe.

1373
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:34,375
And so am I for Ganymede.

1374
01:27:35,236 --> 01:27:36,692
And so am I for Rosalind.

1375
01:27:37,145 --> 01:27:38,380
And so am I.

1376
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:40,523
For no woman.

1377
01:27:41,628 --> 01:27:43,575
Pray you, no more of this.

1378
01:27:44,203 --> 01:27:47,852
'Tis like the howling of Irish
wolves against the moon.

1379
01:27:49,275 --> 01:27:51,046
I will help you if I can.

1380
01:27:52,432 --> 01:27:54,481
I would love you if I could.

1381
01:27:56,228 --> 01:27:58,281
Tomorrow. Meet me all together.

1382
01:27:59,586 --> 01:28:00,905
I will marry you.

1383
01:28:01,579 --> 01:28:03,412
If ever I marry woman.

1384
01:28:04,187 --> 01:28:06,053
And I'll be married tomorrow.

1385
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:09,939
I will satisfy you.

1386
01:28:10,615 --> 01:28:13,421
If ever I satisfy man.

1387
01:28:14,473 --> 01:28:16,422
And you shall be married tomorrow.

1388
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:19,432
I will content you.

1389
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:22,610
If what pleases you contents you.

1390
01:28:23,427 --> 01:28:25,659
And you shall be married tomorrow.

1391
01:28:26,862 --> 01:28:29,171
As you love Rosalind, meet.

1392
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:32,716
As you love Phoebe, meet.

1393
01:28:34,031 --> 01:28:35,656
And as I love no woman.

1394
01:28:36,476 --> 01:28:37,299
I'll meet.

1395
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:40,594
So fare you well.
I have left you commands.

1396
01:28:42,289 --> 01:28:43,770
I'll not fail, if I live.

1397
01:28:45,295 --> 01:28:46,072
Nor I.

1398
01:28:53,894 --> 01:28:54,588
Nor I.

1399
01:30:10,633 --> 01:30:12,410
Good duke, receive thy daughter.

1400
01:30:13,315 --> 01:30:14,930
Hymen from heaven brought her.

1401
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:17,484
I brought her hither.

1402
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,983
That thou mightst join.

1403
01:30:20,683 --> 01:30:22,340
Her hand and his.

1404
01:30:23,828 --> 01:30:25,914
Whose heart within his bosom is.

1405
01:30:27,538 --> 01:30:30,644
If there be truth in sight,
you are my daughter.

1406
01:30:32,067 --> 01:30:33,684
If there be truth in sight.

1407
01:30:34,505 --> 01:30:35,729
You are my Rosalind.

1408
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,184
If sight and shape be true.

1409
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:40,617
Why then, my love adieu.

1410
01:30:41,991 --> 01:30:43,604
I'll have no father.

1411
01:30:44,253 --> 01:30:46,326
If you be not he.

1412
01:30:49,992 --> 01:30:51,739
I'll have no husband.

1413
01:30:52,428 --> 01:30:54,448
If you be not he.

1414
01:30:58,695 --> 01:31:01,183
Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

1415
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,759
O my dear niece.

1416
01:31:05,694 --> 01:31:07,363
Welcome thou art to me.

1417
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:13,129
Even daughter,
welcome in no less degree.

1418
01:31:18,762 --> 01:31:21,356
I will not eat my word.
Now thou art mine.

1419
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:24,770
Thy faith, my fancy to
thee doth combine.

1420
01:33:06,459 --> 01:33:08,527
Let me have audience for a word or two.

1421
01:33:10,303 --> 01:33:14,178
Duke Frederick, hearing how every day
men of worth resorted to this forest.

1422
01:33:15,252 --> 01:33:18,190
Addressed a mighty power, which
were on foot In his own conduct.

1423
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:21,961
Purposely to take his brother
here and put him to the sword.

1424
01:33:23,226 --> 01:33:25,180
And to the skirts of
this wild wood he came.

1425
01:33:26,729 --> 01:33:30,591
Where, meeting with an old religious
man, after some question with him.

1426
01:33:31,599 --> 01:33:34,454
Was converted both from his
enterprise and from the world.

1427
01:33:35,849 --> 01:33:38,073
His crown bequeathing
to his banished brother.

1428
01:33:38,741 --> 01:33:41,859
And all their lands restored to them
again that were with him exiled.

1429
01:33:51,235 --> 01:33:52,720
Welcome, young man.

1430
01:33:53,184 --> 01:33:55,203
Thou offer'st fairly to
my daughters' wedding.

1431
01:33:55,722 --> 01:33:58,389
Meantime, forget this
new-fall'n dignity.

1432
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,344
And fall into our rustic revelry.

1433
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:04,478
Proceed.

1434
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:05,840
Proceed.

1435
01:34:06,305 --> 01:34:07,743
We will begin these rites.

1436
01:34:08,436 --> 01:34:10,107
As we do trust they'll end.

1437
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:12,842
In true delights.

1438
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,965
If it be true.

1439
01:34:56,842 --> 01:34:58,684
That good wine needs no bush.

1440
01:35:00,294 --> 01:35:02,834
'Tis true that a good play
needs no epilogue.

1441
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:06,365
Yet to good wine they
do use good bushes.

1442
01:35:06,947 --> 01:35:08,804
And good plays prove the better.

1443
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:11,012
By the help of good epilogues.

1444
01:35:13,108 --> 01:35:15,747
What a case am I in then.

1445
01:35:16,916 --> 01:35:18,535
That am neither a good epilogue.

1446
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,863
Nor cannot insinuate with you.

1447
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:23,767
In the behalf of a good play.

1448
01:35:24,649 --> 01:35:26,447
I am not furnished like a beggar.

1449
01:35:27,419 --> 01:35:28,734
Therefore to beg.

1450
01:35:29,712 --> 01:35:31,275
Will not become me.

1451
01:35:32,339 --> 01:35:34,905
My way is to conjure you.

1452
01:35:35,852 --> 01:35:37,085
And I'll begin.

1453
01:35:37,959 --> 01:35:39,128
With the women.

1454
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,806
I charge you.

1455
01:35:43,593 --> 01:35:44,639
O women.

1456
01:35:45,803 --> 01:35:47,774
For the love you bear to men.

1457
01:35:49,302 --> 01:35:51,583
To like as much of this play.

1458
01:35:52,995 --> 01:35:55,176
As please you.

1459
01:35:56,336 --> 01:35:58,003
And I charge you.

1460
01:35:59,293 --> 01:36:00,223
O men.

1461
01:36:01,205 --> 01:36:03,175
For the love you bear to women.

1462
01:36:04,557 --> 01:36:07,234
That between you and the women.

1463
01:36:08,124 --> 01:36:10,645
The play may please.

1464
01:36:23,397 --> 01:36:24,403
..w-g..
