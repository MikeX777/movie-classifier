1
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:04,930
(gentle music)

2
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:42,495
(dramatic music)

3
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,396
(speaking in foreign language)

4
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:34,850
- You have done well.

5
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,063
Merlin's spell is weakening.

6
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,753
I can feel the bonds on my cage breaking.

7
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:47,630
- Your suggestions were useful,

8
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,610
the theories all check out.

9
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,160
Now it's just a matter of practical work

10
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,960
setting up the machines.

11
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,443
A few days, a week at
most, and we'll be ready.

12
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,860
- Excellent, hmm.

13
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,883
Good.

14
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:04,003
There had better not be any mistakes.

15
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,720
- We have a deal.

16
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,953
As long as you stick to it,
there won't be any mistakes.

17
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:15,638
- Of course.

18
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,616
(woman gasping)

19
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:46,292
(man gasping)
(man groaning)

20
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,460
- What's happened? How is it going?

21
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,893
Is Maxwell ready for us?

22
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:52,696
- Don't grief, Mother.

23
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:55,196
Why don't you give me a
chance to catch my breath?

24
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,270
This isn't easy, you know.

25
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,893
- Wine, bring wine, quickly.

26
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,423
You, Guinevere, revere
us and pass that wine.

27
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,603
- Yes, wine, yes, yes, yes.

28
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:17,752
(Merlin gasps)

29
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:21,856
Merlin.

30
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,541
- Merlin.

31
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:28,244
- Stop him!

32
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,414
- [Guinevere] Run, Merlin!

33
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,028
- [Mordred] Help me up.

34
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:45,861
Get him.

35
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,528
(men screaming)

36
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:00,413
- Are you all right?

37
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:03,609
Would you like something to drink?

38
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:05,340
- Oh, no, thank you.

39
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,220
Did I get through to
the spirits this time?

40
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,420
- I'm afraid not, mother's
being a little stubborn.

41
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,750
- I'm sorry, Ms. Maxwell,
I don't understand,

42
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,900
normally I get through
without any trouble.

43
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,283
- Don't worry yourself,
Megan, we'll try again.

44
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,105
Hi, Kate, how are you?

45
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:25,180
- Fine, thank you.

46
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,013
- Kate!

47
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:28,685
- It's all right.

48
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,500
- Kate, that was not very polite.

49
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,850
- Well, I don't like her and I
don't like her upsetting you.

50
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,650
- That is no excuse for bad manners.

51
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,020
- I am too old for this.

52
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,406
Oh, no!

53
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:16,137
- [Lancelot] Guinevere.

54
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:17,140
- Lancelot.

55
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,630
- What's going on?

56
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,770
- [Guinevere] Merlin's here.

57
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,603
- Merlin?

58
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:21,750
- Yes.

59
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,660
- You're joking?

60
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,020
- No.

61
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,883
Maybe he's come to free us.

62
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,950
- Free us after all this
time, what's changed?

63
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,893
- Maxwell.

64
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,173
- Maxwell?

65
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:37,237
Come on.

66
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:48,819
- Hello, Merlin.

67
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:58,532
Caught you like a rat in a trap.

68
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:06,160
- Merlin!

69
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,839
Merlin, come on, Merlin!

70
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,361
- After them.

71
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:35,793
(tires screeching)

72
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:44,380
- Well, Richie, what do
you think of our mountains?

73
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,407
Bet you got nothing like them in Iowa,

74
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:49,777
you'll just love it here,
there's never a dull moment.

75
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,060
Pity your father isn't here.

76
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,400
- Everlyn, Hank's dead,

77
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,510
he didn't decide to go to Hawaii.

78
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,343
Oh, no!

79
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:03,658
(vehicle honking)

80
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,534
- Stupid woman.

81
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,734
(water splashing)

82
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,422
- Merlin.

83
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,172
- [Merlin] Guinevere.

84
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,223
- Come on, we've all got jobs to do.

85
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:55,131
(car rumbling)

86
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,740
- Everlyn, look.

87
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,818
(woman groaning)

88
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:23,524
- Come on, Merlin, stop being so pompous.

89
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,087
- Pull it, Merlin, we need to start,

90
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,087
we don't have much time.

91
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,762
- Thank you.

92
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:31,262
- You are welcome.

93
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,536
- Wow.

94
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
- What are you doing?

95
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,500
- Keeping an eye on Mordred.

96
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,950
- What, after all this time,
don't you ever give up?

97
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,630
- How can I, my spell is
breaking, dark forces stir,

98
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,420
the world balance is on
the brink of disaster.

99
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,540
- What, again?

100
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,100
- Yes, again.

101
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,910
- Just because you've
given up fighting Mordred

102
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,270
doesn't mean we all have.

103
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,364
(man screaming)

104
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,737
- What, come on, quick, we must go now.

105
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
- [Merlin] This way, Guinevere, come on.

106
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,950
- Well, that's taken care of them,

107
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,213
but I don't know how
to get you out of here.

108
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,293
- That's all right, I
can take care of myself,

109
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:36,170
now that I have a few
moments to concentrate.

110
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,993
- Can't you take me with you?

111
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,074
- I'm sorry.

112
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,700
So far the spell's only weakened,

113
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
it still holds you all here.

114
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,590
- But I so want to see the sky again.

115
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,107
- Oh, I think you might.

116
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:55,640
In fact, if I can't
stop Mordred and Maxwell

117
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,450
from completely wrecking my spell

118
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,640
everyone here will see the sky.

119
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,723
Now, I must go.

120
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,074
- [Guinevere] No, wait.

121
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:09,123
- What, what is it?

122
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,293
- How's Arthur?

123
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:17,283
- Well, asleep, I hope.

124
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:20,260
Though, the spell holding him

125
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,310
is weaker than the spell holding Mordred.

126
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:26,150
To tell you the truth, I don't know.

127
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,983
I must check.

128
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,686
Thank you.

129
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,660
- Give him my...

130
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:44,591
Love.

131
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:57,274
(people screaming)

132
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:02,890
(Everlyn laughing)

133
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,160
- Mary, dear, you remember Merlin?

134
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,993
- Oh, yeah, hi.

135
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,983
- I'm too old for this.

136
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:18,793
- [Everlyn] See, dear,
nothing's changed, welcome home.

137
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:26,280
- How are you feeling now?

138
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,113
- Better.

139
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,300
What's going on outside?

140
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,210
- Everlyn nearly run down Merlin.

141
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,960
He was out jogging in his underwear.

142
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,360
See you later, mum.

143
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,193
- Bye.

144
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,105
(drumming)

145
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,850
- What do you think, Gawain?

146
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,343
The young beast is large.

147
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,740
- Aye, sire, and stronger.

148
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,553
- Strong, but slow.

149
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,093
And my muscles ache for action.

150
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,030
- Had we better just lie low
until we know where we are?

151
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,493
- Get the others ready.

152
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,620
Come on, get him, get him.

153
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,700
(truck wheezing)

154
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,000
(truck honking)

155
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,191
No.

156
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,608
No, Gawain, stop.

157
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,757
(men screaming)

158
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:40,514
- The beast didn't feel a
thing, it just kept going.

159
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,913
Sire, look.

160
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,613
- [Arthur] What is it?

161
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:53,708
- What's going on there?

162
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,714
- I don't know.

163
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:55,760
- You don't think that...

164
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,593
- What?

165
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:57,743
- They will attack us.

166
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,600
- You don't think it could
be the big beast's cub.

167
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,703
- Aye, maybe.

168
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,960
- I think we'd better go.

169
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,823
- Okay.

170
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,366
- Well, go on, hurry up.

171
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,310
- All right.
- Hurry up.

172
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,210
- I'm doing my best.

173
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,543
- Pump it, they're coming down here now.

174
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,710
Why don't you put it in gear?

175
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:01,980
- Merlin.

176
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,813
- Arthur.

177
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,826
(somber music)

178
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,563
- Everything okay, honey?

179
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:22,730
- Yeah, great.

180
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,260
- I know it's hard, Richie,
but give things a go,

181
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,053
you'll like it here, I promise.

182
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:43,900
- I'm hungry.

183
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,180
- [Merlin] Everything's wrong

184
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,900
and if you're awake,
Mordred's almost free,

185
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,500
and the whole village thinks
I'm some crazy old man.

186
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:59,741
- [Arthur] Hurry up, Merlin.

187
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,300
- [Merlin] I'll be with you in a minute.

188
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,770
I'll be with you in a minute.

189
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,603
Dammit.

190
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,443
It's Maxwell I blame,

191
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:10,949
meddling in things she doesn't understand,

192
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:13,940
her damn experiments
messing up all my spells,

193
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,910
then look at my robes, no one knows which-

194
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,433
- Stop dithering, Merlin, and pick one,

195
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,703
they're all the same.

196
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,640
- You and your damn fool
knights could've killed me.

197
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,733
- I still might if you don't
tell me what's going on.

198
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,440
- What do you remember?

199
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,473
- Camelot.

200
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:36,456
Lancelot.

201
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:38,435
Guinevere.

202
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,293
Mordred.

203
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:47,580
Stonehenge.

204
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,933
I was dying.

205
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,933
- So you were.

206
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,460
Mordred had all but won.

207
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,493
Our army was routed,
it's remnants dispersed.

208
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,243
We were trapped.

209
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:26,482
(people shouting)

210
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,893
Only the power of the stones
was keeping Mordred at bay.

211
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:47,730
(lightning crackling)

212
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,983
Mordred's magic was too strong.

213
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,763
- Can you hold, Merlin?

214
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,983
- No.

215
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:56,414
They come.

216
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,463
- Why do they wait?

217
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,860
- They wait for their lord.

218
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:47,619
Death.

219
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:51,235
Mordred.

220
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,077
(horse whinnying)

221
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:04,910
- Ah, Arthur.

222
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,290
You look surprised, Merlin.

223
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,360
Did you really think your pathetic efforts

224
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,130
could keep me out?

225
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,823
- Leave, Mordred, you'll destroy us all.

226
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,740
(Mordred chuckling)

227
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,063
- [Merlin] I thought I
learned to control the spell

228
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:29,853
but what cared he if
he destroyed the world.

229
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,633
- Looks like we were just in time.

230
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,080
- In time to die, witch.

231
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,423
- You fool.

232
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,600
Haven't you learned anything yet?

233
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,623
Your day is over, you're finished.

234
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:00,469
- Guinevere.

235
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,670
- Yes, that's right, Arthur, Guinevere,

236
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,789
and she's mine now, she's all mine.

237
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:08,622
- No.

238
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,600
- [Merlin] The powers I hold in my staff,

239
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,260
I released at Mordred,

240
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,803
but in vain.

241
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,333
- Bravo, Merlin, bravo.

242
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,990
Just a few days ago, that
blast would've killed me,

243
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,909
but not now.

244
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:32,157
Not now.

245
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,793
I have this.

246
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,983
- Excalibur.

247
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,160
How did you?

248
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,513
- Never trust a lady,
Arthur, least of all a queen.

249
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:48,320
- What?

250
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,153
- Arthur.

251
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,960
What's a queen to do on long cold nights

252
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,223
when her husband is away playing king?

253
00:22:58,866 --> 00:22:59,720
- Lancelot.

254
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,123
- [Mordred] Explain to
your king, Sir Knight.

255
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,113
- [Merlin] All seemed lost.

256
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,650
Again, I released the energies
I had gathered at Mordred,

257
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,343
but Mordred had Excalibur.

258
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,773
- Merlin, hold.

259
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:22,974
Hold.

260
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,860
- [Merlin] No, I can't.

261
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:32,923
- You'll never defeat Excalibur, Merlin.

262
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,645
No!

263
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:48,478
- No!

264
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,083
- For the dragon!

265
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:04,867
- Stonehenge was broken.

266
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,084
(thunder cracking)

267
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,192
It's been broken for 1500 years.

268
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:22,158
- 15?

269
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,723
- Just be grateful that
Lancelot did what he did.

270
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,270
- Lancelot.

271
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,960
I'll kill him.

272
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,640
- I trusted him with
my wife and Excalibur.

273
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,883
- He saved your life.

274
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
I couldn't destroy Mordred.

275
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,990
He's too powerful, but

276
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,853
thanks to Lancelot's little diversion,

277
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,253
I managed to banish Mordred
to another dimension.

278
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,613
- And Guinevere?

279
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,290
- She's with Mordred.

280
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,460
I'm afraid he's using
his magic and a medium

281
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,603
to make contact with a
scientist from this world.

282
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,103
- Scientist?

283
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:22,463
- Oh, alchemist.

284
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,870
She's been experimenting

285
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,400
with the magnetic flows of the earth

286
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,453
which is where I get my power.

287
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,430
It's bad enough that she's already broken

288
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,930
the spell holding you,
if we don't stop her,

289
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,143
she'll break the spell
holding Mordred, too.

290
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,133
- 1500 years and nothing's changed.

291
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,560
If we couldn't defeat them then,

292
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,950
how are we going to defeat them now?

293
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,863
- I wish I knew.

294
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,603
- We need Excalibur.

295
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,457
What happened to Excalibur?

296
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,460
- Mordred has it.

297
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,445
(electronic whirring)

298
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,042
- So, how are we doing?

299
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:40,959
Yes, that's good, good.

300
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,940
Oh, Roz, I've got a meeting,

301
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,450
make sure we stay on schedule.

302
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,400
- [Roz] Yeah, sure.

303
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:07,820
(Game Boy beeping)

304
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,130
- Your mum seems happy to be
back home, don't you think?

305
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,613
It's not easy for her, Richie.

306
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,890
She misses your dad, she needs her family.

307
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,640
You can't blame her for
wanting to come home.

308
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,440
- Not easy for her, what about me?

309
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,150
I didn't ask to come here.

310
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,060
This place is a dump, I've got no friends.

311
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,110
- You'll soon make new friends, Richard.

312
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,263
- Oh, sure, where?

313
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,533
- [Kate] Hi.

314
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:50,366
- Hi.

315
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,610
- Mom asked if you could
post these for her.

316
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,968
- No problem.

317
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:56,118
- [Kate] It should come
to three pounds 87.

318
00:27:57,585 --> 00:27:58,660
I think that's the right money.

319
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,493
- Thank you.

320
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:02,560
Kate, meet my nephew, Richie.

321
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,393
- Hi.

322
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:04,226
- Hi.

323
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,826
- Dungeon Keeper, I've got
Breakup on my PlayStation.

324
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:09,869
- Yeah?

325
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,130
- Yeah, you fancy a game?

326
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,073
- [Richie] Sure, there's
nothing else to do around here.

327
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:21,448
- Everlyn, you're a genius.

328
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:22,813
- How long are you staying for?

329
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,250
- For good, I guess, my mom was born here.

330
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,300
Aunt Everlyn's the only family we've got.

331
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,500
- [Kate] Rats.

332
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,530
- What's wrong

333
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,930
- Mum's working.

334
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,190
- What does she do?

335
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,693
- Oh, she's a medium.

336
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,443
- Cool.

337
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:44,830
(Kate gasping)

338
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,663
What's wrong?

339
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:48,183
- Shh, something's not right.

340
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,430
- Do you think that's a good idea?

341
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,494
What is it, what?

342
00:29:11,494 --> 00:29:12,433
- [Kate] Look.

343
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,875
- I don't believe it, what is it?

344
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,018
- Shh, can't you be quiet?

345
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:26,270
- [Maxwell] I hope you
have good reason for this,

346
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,811
I'm needed at the lab.

347
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:28,693
- Quiet, wench.

348
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,230
How ready are you, can
you complete it tonight?

349
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,850
- No, I don't know, why the rush?

350
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,863
- There are other forces at work.

351
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,200
If I am to move my army
through the gate unopposed,

352
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,603
it has to be now.

353
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,730
- I'll try, it won't be
easy, there's a lot to do.

354
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,983
- If you want the power that you crave,

355
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,510
you will do more than try.

356
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:16,700
- We have to stop them.

357
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,020
Come on.

358
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,853
- What are you doing?

359
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:21,147
- I told you we have to stop Maxwell.

360
00:30:22,075 --> 00:30:23,908
Are you coming or not?

361
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:59,850
- All right, my pet, you'll
soon be at your room,

362
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,413
just think how good it'll be

363
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:04,571
when you switch places with
Arthur leaving him to rot.

364
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,406
- Put a sock in it.

365
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,989
- What, sweetheart?

366
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,806
Will Maxwell open the gate tonight?

367
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:11,639
- Yes.

368
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:12,810
- Don't you get touchy with me?

369
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,713
- Just shut up.

370
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,720
- Those two deserve each other.

371
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,673
- We must warn Merlin and Arthur.

372
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,760
- I don't think Arthur will believe

373
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,780
anything we have to say, do you?

374
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,400
- Maybe.

375
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,010
Maybe not.

376
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,163
We've got to try.

377
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:33,690
There's too much at stake not to.

378
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,090
- Believe me, when that
gate opens tonight,

379
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,608
we're going through.

380
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:38,253
On that you have my word.

381
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,124
Come.

382
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,320
- Will the lady of the
lake come if you call her?

383
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,983
- No, I can't reach her.

384
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,949
I have no idea whether Lancelot destroyed,

385
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:28,300
all I know he destroyed Stonehenge.

386
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
- So, what do we do?

387
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,173
- Trust in luck, jump.

388
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,633
- And hope she catches me?

389
00:32:43,947 --> 00:32:46,580
- The sword is in Mordred's throne room

390
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,963
embedded in the lodestone,
just where Lancelot left it.

391
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,743
Neither he nor Mordred can pull it free,

392
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,523
only you can do that.

393
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,053
You are the chosen one for Excalibur.

394
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,393
- Gawain.

395
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,130
I leave you in charge whilst I'm gone.

396
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,053
- Is this necessary?

397
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,660
- I can't stop Mordred without Excalibur.

398
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,360
It's our only defense against him.

399
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,763
And don't do anything rash.

400
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,840
Are you sure there's no other way?

401
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,690
- Fairly sure.

402
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:06,841
(heartbeat thumping)

403
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:32,340
- She didn't catch him.

404
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,173
- No.

405
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,610
But she let him in.

406
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:44,197
- [Gawain] Merlin.

407
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:56,184
(car honking)

408
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,417
- Morning, Ms. Maxwell.

409
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:10,180
- Where are we?

410
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,013
- Maxwell's lab.

411
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,420
- Well, it should be
happening next week sometime.

412
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,590
- Yeah, can we talk about it then?

413
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,500
Get the rotors sorted out.

414
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,333
- Right.

415
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,764
- What's he doing here?

416
00:35:43,764 --> 00:35:44,597
- Don't know,

417
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:46,210
but he sure has a habit of popping up

418
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,690
in the strangest of places.

419
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,820
- I knew we couldn't trust him.

420
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,870
- [Richie] You don't know that.

421
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,150
- Anyway, if he wasn't
working for Maxwell,

422
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,283
why would he be here?

423
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,293
- Shh!

424
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,523
Come on.

425
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,827
(sneaky music)

426
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,458
This way.

427
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:56,799
- [Kate] There's Maxwell.

428
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:57,861
- [Richie] What is that?

429
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:58,944
- [Kate] Shh!

430
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,443
- Okay, Sherri, now.

431
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:14,723
(eerie whirring)

432
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:26,935
Oh my god, it's working.

433
00:37:28,698 --> 00:37:30,281
- What's happening?

434
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,135
- You.

435
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:01,338
Stop him.

436
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:02,618
Get him.

437
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:04,035
Get him, someone.

438
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,263
- We have to help him, come on.

439
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:24,479
This will stop them.

440
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:26,704
Turn it.

441
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:34,906
- Get them.

442
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,815
- You can't stop me.

443
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:13,815
My strength has grown tenfold
since my imprisonment.

444
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:17,425
No!

445
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:20,844
No!

446
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:24,086
You little runt.

447
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:30,688
- Now.

448
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:32,888
- Stop them.

449
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:36,552
Protect the gate.

450
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:38,528
- Go.

451
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:47,526
- Merlin.

452
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,681
- [Lancelot] Guinevere.

453
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,320
Good luck.

454
00:39:58,663 --> 00:39:59,496
(alarm blaring)

455
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:01,125
- No!

456
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:01,958
Stop them.

457
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,010
Stop them, you idiots.
- Come on, come on.

458
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,433
- Someone.
- Let's go.

459
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:10,652
- They're ruining everything.

460
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:11,485
Stop them.

461
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:14,395
- Throw it at them.

462
00:40:17,692 --> 00:40:18,525
Come on.

463
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:37,036
- Oh, you'll pay for that.

464
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:38,203
- Really, how?

465
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,391
Guinevere's gone.

466
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,993
Hello, mother.

467
00:40:53,476 --> 00:40:54,726
- Look at that.

468
00:40:57,493 --> 00:41:00,076
(eerie sounds)

469
00:41:02,756 --> 00:41:03,800
- Yes.

470
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,633
Yes.

471
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:08,175
The old man is weakened.

472
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:11,653
He cannot close the rift.

473
00:41:23,055 --> 00:41:25,790
Mother, dear, I will
take every spell maker

474
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,583
and witch here now.

475
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:37,645
(water babbling)

476
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,873
- God, it's good to be
free, to drink fresh water,

477
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,163
to feel the wind, to see the trees.

478
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,943
So green.

479
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:21,113
Look at the stars.

480
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:24,711
They're beautiful.

481
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:30,230
- If Mordred gets out, the
trees won't stay green for long.

482
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,530
- Well, we'll just have to make sure

483
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,703
that he won't get out.

484
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,580
- How?

485
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,433
- I don't know.

486
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,703
Maybe Arthur will.

487
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,093
- I'm afraid Arthur isn't here.

488
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,485
- He's not?

489
00:42:44,485 --> 00:42:46,185
- No, he went to go get Excalibur.

490
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,332
- You mean I've come here
to warn him about Mordred

491
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:53,513
and he's gone in to get the sword.

492
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,113
- Yes.

493
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,052
- We sure gave Mordred a shock

494
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:03,433
when we hit him with the water.

495
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:07,683
- [Merlin] First bath he's
had in a thousand years.

496
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,430
- [Kate] Listen, Merlin.

497
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,263
- [Merlin] Yes?

498
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:16,433
- I owe you an apology.

499
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,220
I thought you were on Maxwell's side.

500
00:43:20,345 --> 00:43:21,940
- Oh, that's all right, Kate.

501
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,143
I've always been misunderstood.

502
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,333
There's no harm done.

503
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,690
Well, it's been a long day.

504
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,453
I suggest we all get some sleep.

505
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,803
And decide what to do tomorrow.

506
00:43:57,108 --> 00:43:58,350
(dog barking)

507
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,730
- Cheer up, at least your
mom will be all right now.

508
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,317
Maxwell won't come near her.

509
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,773
- Yeah, guess you're
right, see you tomorrow.

510
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,673
- See ya.

511
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,503
Hey, aunt.

512
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,370
- Richie, are you all right?

513
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,690
- Fine, just great.

514
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,253
You were right, aunt,
it ain't so bad here.

515
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,613
Goodnight.

516
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,530
- What's got into him?

517
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:42,383
- Who cares, as long as it lasts.

518
00:44:45,908 --> 00:44:46,991
- [Kate] Mom.

519
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:53,837
(eerie chanting)

520
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:04,082
- You know what to do.

521
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:13,537
Do not fail me.

522
00:46:46,924 --> 00:46:49,757
(woman shrieking)

523
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:28,769
- Hey.
- Hi.

524
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:04,537
- [Man] Drink this.

525
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:05,537
- Thank you.

526
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:08,924
- Get warm, I won't be long.

527
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:21,288
(dogs barking and howling)

528
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:44,336
Edmund?

529
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,044
(howling)

530
00:49:55,044 --> 00:49:58,294
(eerie ominous sounds)

531
00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:05,479
(man humming)

532
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:15,996
(television crackling)

533
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:18,663
(man screaming)

534
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:39,354
- Mom.

535
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,832
Mom.

536
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:03,804
- [Mom] Let me go.

537
00:53:03,804 --> 00:53:04,783
- [Man] Quit stalling, woman.

538
00:53:04,783 --> 00:53:05,924
- Hold it right there.

539
00:53:05,924 --> 00:53:07,300
- Kate!

540
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,383
Let me go, take whatever
you want, but let me go.

541
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,869
(Kate screaming)

542
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:32,016
(Richie groaning)

543
00:53:36,148 --> 00:53:36,981
- Kate!

544
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:40,037
What?

545
00:53:41,961 --> 00:53:42,794
What?

546
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,426
- Get off me, get off me.

547
00:53:52,484 --> 00:53:53,734
- Oh, no, Kate.

548
00:53:59,983 --> 00:54:01,881
What are you doing?

549
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:03,383
Let go of me.

550
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:04,550
Help, stop it.

551
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:22,854
What do you want?

552
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:28,410
- I want you to help me.

553
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,733
- Never.

554
00:54:32,543 --> 00:54:33,376
- Never?

555
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,880
Never?

556
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,437
My young friend, you
have absolutely no idea

557
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,993
how long never can be.

558
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,763
- Why, why should we help you?

559
00:54:48,324 --> 00:54:53,324
- Well, that's a very good
question, very good question.

560
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,090
How about because you have misunderstood

561
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,043
shall we say my point of view?

562
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,603
No?

563
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:14,130
Well, then what about out
of respect for your betters?

564
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,320
Well, then I guess that leaves
us with the obvious choice,

565
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,283
blackmail, imprisonment.

566
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,123
Torture.

567
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:38,563
I see I'm getting closer
to what motivates you.

568
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,843
- You'll never make us do anything.

569
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:45,883
- There's that never again.

570
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,693
I would love to teach you about never,

571
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,020
but I haven't the time.

572
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,640
That's a joke, Richie, my
god, don't you get anything?

573
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,083
Time, never.

574
00:56:13,017 --> 00:56:14,952
(Mordred clapping)

575
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:17,140
Have a look at this, Richie.

576
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:17,973
- Mom!

577
00:56:19,348 --> 00:56:20,181
- Mom!

578
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,157
Look at your face now.

579
00:56:26,852 --> 00:56:28,680
Shall I have her killed?

580
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,300
- No, let her go, please.

581
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,883
- Help me, please, Richie.

582
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,650
- Richie, help me, please.

583
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,483
- Let her go.

584
00:56:39,615 --> 00:56:42,763
- Your mother's life belongs to me now.

585
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,373
- What do you want us to do?

586
00:56:48,436 --> 00:56:49,736
- It's very simple really.

587
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,743
I just want you to kill Merlin.

588
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:11,390
- Here.

589
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,233
- What is it?

590
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,660
- Well, for what it's worth,

591
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,823
it's an irregular magnetic pulse switcher.

592
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,700
You push this button here as you point it

593
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,980
and it releases a frequency

594
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,583
that causes waves in the
earth's magnetic field.

595
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,622
I'm rather proud of it.

596
00:57:27,622 --> 00:57:30,372
(gadget beeping)

597
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,010
Careful, you could cause
a small earthquake.

598
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,610
- So, what's it for?

599
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:47,190
- Well, you wait until
Merlin's casting spell,

600
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:50,640
preferably a big one, then
you point this at him.

601
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,740
As it's the earth's magnetic
field that powers his spells,

602
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,920
this little gadget will disrupt the flow,

603
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,160
the spell will turn back on itself,

604
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,293
poof, Merlin goes up in smoke.

605
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,293
- Well, if it's that simple,
why haven't you used it?

606
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,260
- I'm not a murderer.

607
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,633
- Of course, he could always
turn it on Mordred instead.

608
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,463
- I'm sure his dear mother
would thank him for that.

609
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:47,770
- I knew you'd come.

610
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,803
- So, traitor.

611
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,790
You didn't have the nerve
to stab me in the back.

612
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,223
- I betrayed no one.

613
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,663
I fell in love.

614
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,453
- I trusted you.

615
00:59:06,654 --> 00:59:08,443
You were my friend.

616
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,383
- I'm sorry.

617
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,990
- Sorry?

618
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,280
- [Lancelot] Yes.

619
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,720
- Sorry?

620
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,923
- Yes, I'm sorry.

621
00:59:21,034 --> 00:59:23,867
(swords clanking)

622
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,082
Arthur.

623
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,990
- I'm gonna kill you, piece by piece.

624
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:43,057
- If you do, you won't
reach Excalibur, will you?

625
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:49,878
Listen to me.

626
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:58,259
I was right.

627
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:02,463
- Not only to me, but
the whole round table.

628
01:00:05,016 --> 01:00:05,966
- You need my help.

629
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:21,554
You need me.

630
01:00:21,554 --> 01:00:22,387
- Never.

631
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,736
- Arthur, listen to me.

632
01:00:33,302 --> 01:00:34,135
- Stop it.

633
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,587
Does she still love you?

634
01:00:41,462 --> 01:00:42,295
- No.

635
01:00:46,865 --> 01:00:49,448
- [Arthur] Oh, all right, then.

636
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:09,447
- Missed.

637
01:01:17,036 --> 01:01:17,869
Shh!

638
01:01:25,658 --> 01:01:26,658
- All right.

639
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,053
You had to tell them.

640
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,577
- You didn't want it easy, did you?

641
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:11,483
Arthur!

642
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:17,106
(men yelling and screaming)

643
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,460
- We're trapped.

644
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,343
- We can jump it.

645
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,180
- [Arthur] We'd never make it.

646
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:30,193
- Do you wanna live forever?

647
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:31,210
- Yeah.

648
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:32,043
Okay.

649
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,120
- When the flame drops.

650
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,953
You first.

651
01:02:37,413 --> 01:02:38,746
- I'm your king.

652
01:02:50,457 --> 01:02:52,040
- [Mother] Mordred!

653
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:53,851
Mordred.

654
01:02:55,513 --> 01:02:56,346
Mordred.

655
01:02:58,033 --> 01:02:59,594
King Arthur's here.

656
01:02:59,594 --> 01:03:00,975
- What?

657
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:02,308
- Arthur's here.

658
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,110
- I know, mother.

659
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:08,173
- You don't seem to be
too bothered about it.

660
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,893
- Look around you.

661
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,910
Do you really think a couple
of tired old has-beens

662
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,470
can make their way through my whole army?

663
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,870
- What if he gets the sword?

664
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,230
- Don't you listen to anything I say?

665
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,340
Arthur's no threat to us

666
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,350
and if he's here, he
can damn well stay here.

667
01:03:32,114 --> 01:03:33,713
But let's not fall out.

668
01:03:35,759 --> 01:03:36,592
Get out!

669
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,603
Get out now.

670
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,336
My plan is going well.

671
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:54,389
We will soon be free.

672
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,203
- Force the rat to kill Merlin.

673
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,163
- Precisely.

674
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,203
- Ye gods, Merlin,

675
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,620
can't I even eat without you badgering me?

676
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,770
- I didn't say anything.

677
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,663
- The sleep has addled his brain.

678
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,763
- How many times do I have to say this?

679
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,110
Arthur left me in charge not you.

680
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:27,403
- I am queen.

681
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,533
- In name.

682
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,413
- [Merlin] Will you two stop wasting time?

683
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,021
We have to find Mordred.

684
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:39,790
- What are we going to do?

685
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:44,273
- I don't know, but we mustn't
let on about this, not yet.

686
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,573
We need time to think.

687
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:48,813
Come on.

688
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,070
- Mordred is not going to wait
for Arthur to get Excalibur,

689
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:58,634
we have to stop Maxwell ourselves now.

690
01:04:58,634 --> 01:04:59,967
- [Kate] Merlin!

691
01:05:02,922 --> 01:05:03,922
- Now, what?

692
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,173
- Mordred's attacked the village,

693
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:10,761
he's taken everyone prisoner.

694
01:05:10,761 --> 01:05:13,903
- I know, I was just
explaining that to Gawain.

695
01:05:13,903 --> 01:05:14,780
- Well, are you going to help

696
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,470
or leave it to me,
Merlin, and two children?

697
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:19,330
- All right, all right.

698
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,460
Do you know where they've taken them?

699
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,593
- Stonehenge.

700
01:05:25,738 --> 01:05:26,740
(indistinct shouting)

701
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,573
- Stop this.

702
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,503
It's all right, you'll be okay.

703
01:05:57,862 --> 01:05:59,529
- Are you all right?

704
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,513
I've been a fool, Merlin.

705
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,520
Mordred's power may corrupt,

706
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,163
but it will never again
cloak my mind, I'm with you.

707
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,267
Can you save her?

708
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:18,102
Oh, I think she'll live.

709
01:06:28,203 --> 01:06:30,250
- Bury these men with full honors,

710
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:33,373
t'was Mordred's demons we fought
not the men they possessed.

711
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:36,809
Rouse the camp.

712
01:06:39,323 --> 01:06:43,243
We know our enemy and
he awaits our swords.

713
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:44,660
- [Knights] Yeah!

714
01:06:47,163 --> 01:06:50,496
(indistinct whispering)

715
01:07:13,142 --> 01:07:16,360
- You look pleased with yourself.

716
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,750
- Of course, why shouldn't I be?

717
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,973
Things are going well.

718
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,783
Mordred's plans will soon
see him free and Merlin dead.

719
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,293
- Really?

720
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,990
And how do you think
you're going to fit in

721
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:35,500
with Mordred's plans
once he's free that is?

722
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,420
- We have a deal.

723
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,120
I'm a scientist.

724
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,530
Mordred will give me free
reign with my research

725
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:44,210
and all the help I'll
need for my experiments,

726
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:46,280
soon I'll be free of all
the small-minded fools

727
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,357
who think science should
controlled by rules.

728
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:53,220
- Of course you can trust
Mordred to keep his word.

729
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,010
It wouldn't worry him that your science

730
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,860
might one day become a threat to him.

731
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,873
- I think I'm needed.

732
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,550
- [Mom] Just something to think about.

733
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,453
- Where are you, where
are you, where are you?

734
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:14,779
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

735
01:08:14,779 --> 01:08:17,020
Oh, it's always the same.

736
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,830
You can never find
something when you want it.

737
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,098
- What?

738
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,167
- I said you can't-

739
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:30,710
- Oh, yeah, sorry, I
heard, is it important?

740
01:08:31,843 --> 01:08:34,110
- Is it important?

741
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,010
Interesting question.

742
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:38,340
Is anything important?

743
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,630
It depends on the circumstances

744
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:42,310
and to what it relates, I suppose.

745
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:45,120
To a man who's drowning, air is important,

746
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,083
to a fish that's watching, the water.

747
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:51,453
Good question.

748
01:08:53,264 --> 01:08:55,180
- Well, can I help you?

749
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,013
- Help what?

750
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,400
- Tell me what you're looking for

751
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,750
and I can help you find it.

752
01:09:00,963 --> 01:09:05,063
- No, no, no, no, no, that's
all right, I'll find it.

753
01:09:05,905 --> 01:09:08,655
(stone scraping)

754
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,433
- Penny for them.

755
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,150
- I was thinking how strange life can be.

756
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,273
And how short.

757
01:09:22,443 --> 01:09:23,860
- What do you mean short?

758
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,340
- Well, I was thinking
of all the friends I had

759
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,170
when Arthur was king,

760
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:31,570
their hopes, their children, their dreams,

761
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:35,023
all crammed into a few short
years of furious living.

762
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:37,980
- You didn't have that with Lancelot,

763
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,210
you had all the time you could ever need.

764
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,210
- Yes, perhaps too long.

765
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,740
- Have you seen Richie?

766
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,910
- Yes, he left with Merlin
to collect a few things

767
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:47,710
from Merlin's house before we leave.

768
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,230
- He's been acting quite strange,

769
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,893
think I'd better go and fetch him.

770
01:09:57,302 --> 01:09:58,570
- Kate.

771
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:01,540
Think about what I said, life is short,

772
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,740
you make the most of it.

773
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:07,793
(birds crowing)

774
01:10:27,921 --> 01:10:31,019
- [Merlin] Well, if it's not
in there, it's gotta be in here

775
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,936
and of course it's not.

776
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,653
- Is that magic?

777
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:40,580
- What?

778
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:43,793
- Your staff, have you
cast a spell to make shine?

779
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,713
- Yes.

780
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:50,373
- Is it a large spell, does
it take a lot of power?

781
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,713
- All spells take a lot of power,

782
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,560
but how much depends on
the person casting them.

783
01:11:02,297 --> 01:11:04,497
It can't be in there,
so it has to be there,

784
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:08,640
and it can't be in here
because it's never in here.

785
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,913
Come on, come on, no, no, no, no.

786
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:15,104
Found it.

787
01:11:16,078 --> 01:11:17,210
- That's it?

788
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,193
A pipe?

789
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,953
Is that what all the fuss was about?

790
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,763
- I keep a pipe, but I never smoke it.

791
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,940
It's my little test to
myself, so far I've passed,

792
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:35,940
but tomorrow is a new day, a new test.

793
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:42,063
Like you, Richie, I will
have a choice to make.

794
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,203
Now.

795
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,083
I think we will both make the right one.

796
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,203
- [Kate] Merlin, Richie, are you there?

797
01:11:52,362 --> 01:11:53,803
- Shall we go?

798
01:11:53,803 --> 01:11:56,427
- [Kate] Are you in there?

799
01:11:56,427 --> 01:11:57,823
- [Richie] Oh, he knows.

800
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:01,140
- [Merlin] Come in, Kate.

801
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,653
- God, he knows.

802
01:12:05,499 --> 01:12:06,696
- He knows what?

803
01:12:06,696 --> 01:12:07,723
- About this?

804
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:08,556
- How can he?

805
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:09,420
- I don't know.

806
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,253
- Shall we go?

807
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:22,975
(metal jingling)

808
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:02,321
- There's Maxwell.

809
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,623
- [Scientist] Carbon
dating results are ready.

810
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:11,373
- This is gonna be a
great day for science.

811
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,560
- [Scientist] Yeah, as
soon as you can, please.

812
01:13:16,081 --> 01:13:17,483
- Yes, this is a big night.

813
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,080
- Make the most of your
next hour, Maxwell,

814
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,700
when Mordred arrives he might
see to it being your last.

815
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,970
- Oh, I don't know,

816
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:38,693
I may have an ace or two up my own sleeve.

817
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,430
How are the levels?

818
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:07,027
Are we close?

819
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:09,277
- [Scientist] Radio online.

820
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,267
- [Scientist] All right,
everyone, here we go.

821
01:14:18,267 --> 01:14:21,600
(electricity crackling)

822
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:35,473
(machine thundering)

823
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:40,683
(high-pitched whirring)

824
01:15:55,543 --> 01:15:56,376
- Mordred.

825
01:15:58,027 --> 01:15:58,860
Look.

826
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:03,840
It's working.

827
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,460
Your magic's working.

828
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,257
- Everyone in place.

829
01:17:21,749 --> 01:17:22,832
- We're free.

830
01:17:29,387 --> 01:17:33,304
(speaking in foreign language)

831
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,766
- Not this time, Merlin.

832
01:18:02,102 --> 01:18:04,352
You're getting old, Merlin.

833
01:18:07,427 --> 01:18:08,643
- [Mother] And tired.

834
01:18:23,372 --> 01:18:24,539
- Not so fast.

835
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,259
- We have the machine, Merlin.

836
01:18:35,259 --> 01:18:36,283
- Good.

837
01:18:36,283 --> 01:18:37,116
Good.

838
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:03,813
- Lancelot.

839
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:08,430
Look, they're through, gotta
cut 'em off from the gate.

840
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:11,040
- Sire, forgive me, but that's a bad idea.

841
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,340
- Trust me.

842
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,690
- Are you sure?

843
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,433
- Yeah, wanna live forever?

844
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,813
- Yes! I got ya.

845
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:33,363
Boy, your time's up.

846
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:37,638
I'll take care of Mordred,

847
01:19:37,638 --> 01:19:40,523
you, don't let anyone through that gate.

848
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,763
- Ready, now.

849
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,265
Cover me.

850
01:20:01,265 --> 01:20:04,098
(swords clanging)

851
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:06,363
- We have to do something.

852
01:21:06,363 --> 01:21:07,196
- I know.

853
01:21:09,344 --> 01:21:12,261
(Mordred groaning)

854
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:26,166
- Do it now.

855
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:27,583
- What about you?

856
01:21:31,369 --> 01:21:32,202
- Come on.

857
01:21:32,202 --> 01:21:33,452
- Richie, wait.

858
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:37,867
- No, Richie, it's too dangerous.

859
01:21:37,867 --> 01:21:38,865
- Richie!

860
01:21:38,865 --> 01:21:39,885
- Come back.

861
01:21:39,885 --> 01:21:40,882
- Quiet!

862
01:21:40,882 --> 01:21:42,549
- No, stop that, no.

863
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:48,953
Rat, I knew you couldn't be trusted.

864
01:21:51,046 --> 01:21:52,963
- Richie, do it, quick.

865
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:06,869
- Your mother dies.

866
01:22:10,705 --> 01:22:12,205
Off with her head.

867
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:18,461
- [Mother] Richie, help me.

868
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:28,138
- [Richie] Let her go now.

869
01:22:28,138 --> 01:22:31,777
- Kill Merlin now or she dies.

870
01:22:31,777 --> 01:22:33,277
- [Mother] Oh, no.

871
01:22:37,575 --> 01:22:40,611
(Richie's mom crying)

872
01:22:40,611 --> 01:22:42,361
- Arthur, just do it.

873
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:52,148
(triumphant music)

874
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:01,709
- Arthur.

875
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:05,713
- Guinevere.

876
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:14,403
- [Kate] Richie.

877
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:23,664
- Give me the sword or the woman dies.

878
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:38,626
- Take it.

879
01:23:41,193 --> 01:23:44,110
(Mordred groaning)

880
01:23:57,836 --> 01:23:58,836
- I'm sorry.

881
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,443
- Everything is ready.

882
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:40,270
- Are you sure about taking
your knights through to there?

883
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:43,913
- We are men out of our time,
Richie, where else can we go?

884
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:49,820
And besides, there's a whole new dimension

885
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:51,600
out there for us to conquer.

886
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:58,563
Kneel.

887
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,743
Arise, Sir Richard,

888
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:28,710
the youngest and last
knight of the round table.

889
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:32,552
- Bravo, young man.

890
01:25:32,552 --> 01:25:33,885
- [Knights] Aye!

891
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:36,759
- [Knight] Well done.

892
01:25:36,759 --> 01:25:39,592
(people clapping)

893
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:52,940
- Kate.

894
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:56,503
This was, is my wedding ring.

895
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,130
You be careful who you give it to.

896
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,550
- [Kate] Thank you.

897
01:26:12,279 --> 01:26:13,440
Will you be okay?

898
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,323
- I think so, it won't be
easy, but I am a queen.

899
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,203
I belong with the king.

900
01:26:25,783 --> 01:26:27,283
- You always have.

901
01:26:32,723 --> 01:26:34,173
You are my queen.

902
01:26:48,378 --> 01:26:49,211
Sire.

903
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:56,633
- Are you still adamant about staying?

904
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:58,703
- Yes.

905
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,763
Well, I've had 1500
years to think about it.

906
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:05,480
That's long enough for any man.

907
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,363
Hope you can look after
yourself without me around.

908
01:27:19,223 --> 01:27:20,073
Good luck to you, sire.

909
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,833
- Good luck.

910
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,593
- It is time, clear the stone.

911
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:48,263
- Don't worry.

912
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,880
We're going to have lots of fun.

913
01:27:56,099 --> 01:27:57,516
- For the dragon.
