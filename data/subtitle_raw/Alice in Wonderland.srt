1
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,532
Oh, you are late.

2
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,053
Forgive me, one moment.

3
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:29,884
Far be it from me, sir.

4
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:32,471
I'm going to raise hell when I ..

5
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,001
Exactly my dear sir. Good morning.
─ Oh, good morning.

6
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:39,826
Well, Francis?

7
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,718
A small matter, Henry. A small matter.

8
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:45,543
Nevertheless, I detect the
sound of distant thunder.

9
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,763
It is my distasteful duty to
speak of Dodgson again.

10
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:51,654
Oh .. he's been attacking
the theatre in London.

11
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,913
I gave him permission.
─ Oh!

12
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:56,781
Come come, Francis.

13
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,205
It all depends on which
way you want to go.

14
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:02,767
You like Duchesses.
He prefers the theatre.

15
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:04,484
In his case, it is a diversion.

16
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:05,861
He has many.

17
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:11,402
His last literary impertinence is a poem
if you please, addressed to the Queen.

18
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,420
Suggesting that the bell.

19
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:16,838
Our bell. Great Tom.

20
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:20,067
Be removed. After 200 years.

21
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,583
Where has it been published?
─ It hasn't yet.

22
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,442
For all we know he was planning to
recite it to the Queen when she arrives.

23
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:29,057
The man is mad.

24
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,167
Downright dangerous.

25
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:33,037
Judge for yourself.

26
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,763
How did you come by this?

27
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,286
Oh .. it found its way to me.

28
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:40,013
Such things often do sometimes.

29
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,207
Shall we send for him?

30
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:46,090
No, no. I'll attend to it presently.

31
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:48,023
Presently?

32
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:55,615
He is out there capering
with your children.

33
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:01,935
Keep still, Alice.

34
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,940
Alice, do keep still.

35
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,297
I can't help it.
There is a fly on my nose.

36
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,189
There are no flies in China.

37
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,584
Only dragons and gryphons.

38
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:12,963
Now.

39
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,056
You must sit on the grass,
just as we planned.

40
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,964
I then take my place
among you heathens .. so.

41
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:22,829
I now count to ten.

42
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:26,919
That is I shall grunt ten times under
my breath precisely as we practiced it.

43
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:27,918
Ready?

44
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:31,007
But Mr Dodgson ..
─ No buts .. no changes.

45
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:33,180
Eyes on the lens .. ready?

46
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:36,671
[ Grunt .. grunt .. grunt ]

47
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,532
[ Grunt .. grunt .. grunt ]

48
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:42,303
[ Grunt .. grunt .. grunt ]

49
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,128
[ Grunt ]

50
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,250
Papa, we are Chinese.

51
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:48,116
Charming costumes.

52
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,846
Yes. They were leant
me by a theatrical friend.

53
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,994
Just a moment, Dodgson.
I want a word with you.

54
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:58,293
I gather you've been
thinking of leaving Oxford.

55
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:01,697
Oxford is an anchor you know, Dodgson.

56
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,732
Without it, you might be
battered by the four winds.

57
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,408
I shall be very sad indeed
if you drifted away.

58
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:11,895
Without once stopping to think how in
the world you can ever get back again.

59
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:14,252
Perhaps you don't feel like that?

60
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,603
Oh yes I do, Dean.

61
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:17,646
Or are the children becoming tiresome?

62
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:19,299
On the contrary.

63
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:24,436
I don't want to leave Oxford .. only ..

64
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:26,216
Go ahead.

65
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:30,669
Nothing .. ever changes here.

66
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,800
If it did, it wouldn't
be Oxford any longer.

67
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,698
"Great Tom" for example.

68
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,335
I gather you suggest some changes there.

69
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,564
You know it was a gift from Charles II?

70
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:44,875
Charles II hasn't personally been ..

71
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:47,905
Disturbed by it since 1685.

72
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:51,247
You consider it a noisy nuisance?
─ Everyone does.

73
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,604
Everyone says so .. in private.

74
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,414
But we haven't the courage
to tell the Sovereign.

75
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:57,368
Exactly, sir.

76
00:05:57,897 --> 00:06:00,285
I think somebody should.
After 200 years.

77
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,581
Very well then.

78
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:04,648
You tell her yourself when
she visits us next week.

79
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,979
And what is the Dean's name?

80
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,383
Doctor Liddell.

81
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:34,697
Doctor Liddell.

82
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,144
He has three little girls.
Lorina Edith and Alice.

83
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,768
Lorina and Edith. And Alice.

84
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:42,593
He writes Greek lexicons.

85
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:45,747
He has a collection of
incunabula in his library.

86
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:47,640
Incunabula?

87
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,486
Old books.

88
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:12,949
Nervous, Dodgson?

89
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:14,924
Not a bit, sir.

90
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:16,675
Dean Liddell.

91
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:20,069
Mrs Liddell wishes you to come at once.

92
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:21,743
Most important.

93
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,649
It concerns the arrangement
of the tarts.

94
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:26,020
And by the way.

95
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,449
I think it would be more orderly if
the children remained in their rooms.

96
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:44,053
Your children, sir.

97
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,485
They will be dreadfully
disappointed not being present.

98
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,902
If they promise faithfully to behave ..

99
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,079
Impossible, Dodgson.
They'll have to stay in their rooms.

100
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,210
But don't worry. We'll have an
excellent view of the proceedings.

101
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:10,855
I say, Dodgson.

102
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,123
If what I hear is true,
our ears will be grateful.

103
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,708
I've suffered with
that bell for 18 years.

104
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:27,535
Alice.

105
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:32,453
Do I have to stay in my room? Do I?

106
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,639
The Vice Chancellor says so.

107
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:39,073
But I <i>want</i> to see the Queen.

108
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:43,902
Hello, Dinah.

109
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:46,925
Dinah wants to see her, too.
─ Oh, that would never do.

110
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,714
A cat may look at a Queen.

111
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,882
You told me that yourself.
─ Merely a figure of speech.

112
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,489
And I'm sure I said .. at a King.

113
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:57,064
Oh, I'll never believe you again.

114
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,272
You are <i>not</i> my friend.

115
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:01,809
That being the case.

116
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,358
I'll take this .. back.

117
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,917
You stole it!

118
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:10,956
You stole one of the Queen's tarts.

119
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,074
Is it cherry?

120
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:12,378
May I present the Dean, Doctor Liddell.

121
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,112
How do you do?

122
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:17,369
And how are Lorina,
Edith and Alice, Dr Liddell?

123
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,442
Very well, thank you, ma'am.

124
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:22,956
I am honoured that Your Majesty
shows an interest in my children.

125
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:27,494
May I present Mr Smith of the
faculty literary luminaries.

126
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,527
Our lecturer in mathematics,
Mr Charles Dodgson.

127
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,507
Otherwise known as Lewis Carroll.

128
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,097
I've read some of your
verse in the Illustrated News.

129
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,996
Charming. Perfectly charming.

130
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,783
And what is the subject
of your latest poem?

131
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:48,493
Well, ma'am .. it concerns tradition.

132
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,759
It is a poem about the bell.

133
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,800
Our bell of Christchurch .. "Great Tom".

134
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:58,015
Yes, that magnificent bell.

135
00:10:58,461 --> 00:10:59,978
It is stimulating to know.

136
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:03,366
That come what may, Great Tom
will ring throughout the ages.

137
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,458
[ Bell rings ]

138
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:08,660
Most impressive.

139
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,148
It <i>is</i> impressive, isn't it.

140
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:12,658
Most impressive.

141
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,203
Come to think of it, nothing quite so
impressive in the whole university.

142
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,265
The voice of Great Tom deserves it.

143
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,062
Would madam like some tea?

144
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:25,796
Ah, tea. We shall be <i>very</i> pleased.

145
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:28,802
After that, we should like
to go to the library ..

146
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:31,330
And see your collection of incunabula.

147
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:47,605
You'll see the Queen's carriage straight
ahead as it drives across the bridge.

148
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:50,721
The Queen herself is still at the house.
─ Yes, but in the library.

149
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,423
We've seen the library dozens of times.
─ Not with the Queen in it.

150
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:55,569
Precisely.

151
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,972
That's why I couldn't possibly
tell you a story there.

152
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,071
A story?

153
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,730
A story about a little girl named ..

154
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:03,391
Alice.

155
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:04,658
I don't want to hear it.

156
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,049
What does Alice do?

157
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:08,116
She visits a strange land.

158
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:11,810
Where strange people do strange things.

159
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,955
Alright. I won't tell it.
─ Yes, tell it. Tell it.       ─ No.

160
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:19,438
The ayes apparently have it.

161
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:21,435
Then I hope there is some animals in it.

162
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:22,682
And nonsense.

163
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,732
What could be pleasanter?

164
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,090
Very well. It happened like this.

165
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:33,438
Alice was beginning to get very tired
of sitting by her sister on the bank.

166
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,458
And of having nothing to do.

167
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:44,680
Suddenly a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her.

168
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,581
Burning with curiosity,
she ran after it.

169
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:03,402
And was just in time to see it
pop down a large rabbit hole.

170
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,120
"Either this well is very deep."

171
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,990
"Or I am falling very slowly."

172
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,197
"Well."

173
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,923
"After such a fall as this."

174
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,814
"I shall think nothing
of falling down stairs."

175
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,526
"How brave they'll
all think me at home."

176
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:07,098
"Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,
even if I fell off the top of a house."

177
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:11,715
"I wonder how many miles
I've fallen by this time."

178
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:16,191
"I wonder what latitude
or longitude I've got to."

179
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,133
"I must be getting somewhere
near the centre of the earth."

180
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:24,638
"Curiouser and curiouser.

181
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:56,643
Oh!

182
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:12,703
Oh my ears and whiskers.
How late it is getting.

183
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,847
What will the queen say.

184
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,543
Don't go splashing
paint over me like that.

185
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:31,446
I couldn't help it.
Seven jogged my elbow.

186
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:34,525
That's right Five. Always
laying the blame on others.

187
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:35,985
You better not talk.

188
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:38,808
I heard the Queen say yesterday
you deserved to be beheaded.

189
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:41,855
What for?
─ That's none of your business, Two.

190
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:45,656
I'm sure the Queen would be
interested in what you are doing.

191
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:48,426
Why are you painting those roses?

192
00:17:48,764 --> 00:17:50,731
Well, the fact is you see, sir.

193
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,404
This here ought to have
been a red rose tree.

194
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,868
And we put a white one in by mistake.

195
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,007
And if the Queen was to find it out.

196
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:00,320
We should have all our heads cut off.

197
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:01,754
So you see, sir ..

198
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,264
Yes. I see.

199
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:05,554
You won't tell the Queen, sir.

200
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,657
She'll have us executed, sir.

201
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,368
Please sir, you were once in our shoes.

202
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:12,876
But I was clever enough
to get out of them.

203
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,375
And today I play croquet with the Queen.

204
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,174
[ Singing ]
"I was the very least,
of the very largest litter."

205
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:23,659
"Of the very fullest
family in the wood."

206
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,381
"My troubles never ceased
and my life was very bitter."

207
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:31,670
"Until I learned the knack
of grabbing what I could."

208
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:36,698
He follows all the rules.
For right, for wrong.

209
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:41,567
"The rules? I Make them as I go along."

210
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,351
"I play the game."

211
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:54,538
"If it advances my own chances."

212
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,512
"I play the game."

213
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:01,893
"I've heard a woman say day is night."

214
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:04,337
"I thought, what an awful dunce."

215
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:10,757
"To say that day is night is silly.
I'll tell her so .. at once."

216
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:17,642
"But .. when I saw that the woman was
the Queen, the case was not the same."

217
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,872
"But she said it once again."

218
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:20,750
Yes.

219
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:22,951
"And I cried <i>Your Majesty</i>".
─ Yes.

220
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:26,755
I .. absolutely agree with you.

221
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,106
That's what made the game.

222
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:36,972
What does it get us?

223
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:41,229
If I gain my ends.

224
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:43,993
Only from my friends.

225
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:46,936
It will spoil until I'm thwart.

226
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,614
I will play until I'm caught.

227
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:57,470
"I play the game!"

228
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,718
I'm much too big.

229
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:07,586
I wish I could shut up like a telescope.

230
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,778
"It's all very well to say <i>drink me</i>."

231
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,555
"But I've heard that if you drink
from a bottle marked poison."

232
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,279
"It's almost certainly to disagree
with you sooner or later.

233
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:33,345
"This bottle is not marked poison."

234
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,835
"It tastes like a mixture of cherry tart,
custard, pineapple, roast turkey .."

235
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,487
"And hot, buttered toast."

236
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:50,992
"What a queer feeling."

237
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:56,131
"I must be shutting up
like a telescope."

238
00:20:57,866 --> 00:21:01,899
"Now I'm just the right size for
going into that lovely garden."

239
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:05,172
"I can't be more than ten inches high."

240
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:14,979
Ouch!

241
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:01,208
"I must be nine feet tall."

242
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,144
Oh, my ears and whiskers.

243
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,861
If you please, sir.

244
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,900
"I'm getting smaller and smaller again."

245
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,940
"Why, it's a fan."

246
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,022
"It's salty."

247
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:26,040
"I must have fallen into the sea."

248
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,209
"This isn't the sea."

249
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:37,758
"It's the tears I wept
when I was so big."

250
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:40,048
"I wish I hadn't cried so much."

251
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:41,459
Outrageous!

252
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:46,430
A mouse!

253
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:49,238
Oh mouse, do you know the
way of getting out of this pool?

254
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:52,168
I'm so very tired of .. swimming.

255
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:54,536
A girl!

256
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:00,436
Don't let her get at me.

257
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,729
She'll do something to somebody.

258
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,996
Please mouse, don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

259
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:07,924
I love animals dearly.

260
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:09,284
You do?

261
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,357
I love Dinah and she's an animal.

262
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:13,422
Such a dear, quiet thing.

263
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,359
And she sits so nicely
by the fire purring.

264
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,798
How picturesque. How <i>very</i> picturesque.

265
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:21,811
By the fire. Purring.

266
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,376
Purring?

267
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,212
Did you say .. "purring"?

268
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:28,909
Yes.
─ Purring!

269
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:30,847
Dinah is a cat!

270
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:02,087
Where .. where am I?

271
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:03,875
What happened?

272
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:09,902
Please come back. Don't be afraid of me.

273
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,963
Why shouldn't I be afraid of you?

274
00:26:13,493 --> 00:26:16,817
I've never heard of a girl in the ocean
sitting on a bottle talking to a mouse.

275
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,838
"Everything is getting curiouser."

276
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:21,543
"And curiouser."

277
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:25,374
"And it's not the way I planned."

278
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,897
"Adventures all around me."

279
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:30,232
"Delight me and astound me."

280
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:33,754
"In this topsy-turvy land."

281
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,644
"Curiouser."

282
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:39,596
"And curiouser."

283
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,787
"I'm upside down."

284
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:44,694
"I'm downside up."

285
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:47,953
"It started early today."

286
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:51,911
"I felt like dancing on the ceiling."

287
00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:55,268
"And I've a feeling I may."

288
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:59,241
"I'm upside down, I'm downside up."

289
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:02,552
"At last I'm having my way."

290
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:10,452
"The rules I once thought
important are unimportant today."

291
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:15,093
"Life was strong when long was long."

292
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:18,772
"And high was always high."

293
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:22,491
"Until I found that over the ground."

294
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:25,607
"The fields are in the sky."

295
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:30,470
"I'm upside down, I'm downside up."

296
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,691
"As far as I can foresee."

297
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:42,005
"This most incredible, hardly
terrible Wonderland will be."

298
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:47,953
"Upside down like you and me."

299
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:49,447
Child.

300
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,590
What is the capital of London?

301
00:27:51,947 --> 00:27:52,954
The house!

302
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:27,902
How exasperating.

303
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:30,665
I know I shall catch my death of cold.

304
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,949
The last tidal wave was ten years ago.

305
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,714
It was a cloudburst.
─ Tidal wave.

306
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:40,487
Cloudburst!
─ Tidal wave.

307
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,570
The question is, how shall we get dry?

308
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,185
Do I hear a motion?

309
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:49,303
One at a time, please.
─ Why, one at a time?

310
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:51,443
All at the same time. It goes faster.

311
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,109
We'll all speak when we please.

312
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:10,332
Order!

313
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,584
Order .. order!

314
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:14,139
Order, please.

315
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:19,958
The committee on floods
and tidal waves will report.

316
00:29:20,612 --> 00:29:23,308
Now then .. who turned on that flood?

317
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,804
None of us would have done it.

318
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:27,663
So unprecedented.
─ So undignified.

319
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,772
The obvious conclusion is that it
must have been done by a stranger.

320
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:32,499
There's a stranger.

321
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:45,529
Order!

322
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,065
Order!

323
00:29:47,343 --> 00:29:49,866
The question is: how to get dry.

324
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:09,306
Order .. order .. order!

325
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,006
Order, please.

326
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:12,836
I'll soon make you dry enough.

327
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,495
Are you all ready?

328
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,777
This is the driest thing I know.

329
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:21,436
William the Conqueror.

330
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:23,201
William the Conqueror.

331
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,004
Who's cause.
─ Who's cause.

332
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:29,282
Was favoured by the Pope.
─ Was favoured by the Pope.

333
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:32,556
Was soon to fight the English.
─ Was soon to fight the English.

334
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:35,575
Edwin and Morcar.
─ Edwin and Morcar.

335
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:38,263
The Earls of Mercia.
─ The Earls of Mercia.

336
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,628
And Northumbria.
─ And Northumbria.

337
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,983
I beg your pardon? Did you speak?

338
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:51,515
Not I.

339
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:53,612
In that case I move that
the meeting adjourns.

340
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:55,810
With the immediate adoption
of more energetic remedies.

341
00:30:56,373 --> 00:30:57,218
My dear.

342
00:30:58,129 --> 00:30:59,613
What are you doing out here?

343
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,593
Run along this moment and fetch
me a pair of gloves and a fan.

344
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:05,570
Quick now.

345
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:09,192
I'd better hurry, before
he finds out who I am.

346
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,019
"He must have taken
me for his housekeeper."

347
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:15,270
"How queer it seems to be
doing messages for a rabbit.

348
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:33,270
What a lovely house.

349
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:38,527
It's just right for a rabbit.

350
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:45,448
If I grow any smaller.

351
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:47,777
I shall disappear altogether.

352
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,946
This must make me grow big.

353
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,247
Whatever can be keeping the girl.

354
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,487
Man here. Man here.

355
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:19,626
Oh, my dear paws.
Oh, my fur and whiskers.

356
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:34,352
Pat, Mack, Mick. Where are you?

357
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:37,131
I'm here, Your Honour.
Digging for apples.

358
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:40,224
Digging for apples, indeed.
Come here at once.

359
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:42,740
What's that in the window?

360
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:49,664
It's her arm, Your Honour.

361
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:51,612
An arm, you guess?

362
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:53,850
Whoever saw one that size?

363
00:32:58,247 --> 00:33:00,306
It's an arm, for all that.

364
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:02,671
Well, it's got no business there.

365
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,986
Take it away.

366
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,787
Do as I tell you, you cowards.

367
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,360
No, no, no. Get me out of this!

368
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:15,192
Now fetch .. the ladder.

369
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:16,919
Bring the large one.

370
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,005
No. That ladder is too short.

371
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,958
"Oh dear. I wonder what they'll do."

372
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:24,887
"I wish I hadn't gone
down that rabbit hole."

373
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:27,252
That's it, men.

374
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:29,817
Now then, it's down the chimney.

375
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:32,681
Who is it to be?

376
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:34,413
Volunteers?

377
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,410
What's that?

378
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,225
There goes Bill.

379
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,138
There goes Bill!

380
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:36,702
My house! My house! What shall I do?

381
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:38,507
Only one thing to do.

382
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:40,702
Burn down the house.
─ No!

383
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:42,979
Burn it down .. down!
─ No!

384
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:49,127
Oh .. a pebble.

385
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:51,584
Throw it, you coward.

386
00:34:58,169 --> 00:34:58,942
Eat me.

387
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,889
Oh, if only it makes me smaller.

388
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,637
After her.

389
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,651
"I don't know why these
creatures chase after me so."

390
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:37,689
"I had to kick Bill a little. And I
didn't mean to turn on that flood."

391
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:21,244
I'm afraid she wants to play.

392
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:29,636
Fetch this stick.

393
00:37:17,524 --> 00:37:19,563
Here ye .. here ye!

394
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:22,484
The Queen's tarts have been stolen.

395
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:23,693
Stolen?

396
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,488
The Queen's tarts.

397
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:27,751
Who could have done it?
─ Who indeed?

398
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,390
The Queen's tarts?
─ Who would dare?

399
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:31,172
I can't imagine.
─ Outrageous.

400
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,919
The criminal classes.
─ Without law.

401
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:34,748
No sense of honour.
─ Call the guards!

402
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:38,081
So unprecedented.
─ So undignified.

403
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:40,710
Unprecedented.
─ Undignified.

404
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,523
Unprecedented!

405
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,110
Undignified.

406
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:46,942
Obviously.

407
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:49,837
It must have been a stranger.

408
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:53,198
And when that stranger is
brought before the Queen.

409
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,687
Off with his head.

410
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:56,802
His?

411
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,075
Or .. <i>her</i> head?

412
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,194
Her?

413
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,590
Look.

414
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:05,099
A girl. A girl.

415
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,424
I told you she did it.

416
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:08,711
A female criminal.
─ That's what she is.

417
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:11,580
So young and yet so vast.
─ She don't look it.

418
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,965
If she were my daughter ..

419
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:14,667
In the name of the Queen.

420
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,329
Forward!

421
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:28,720
A curious voice.

422
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:34,344
Curiouser and curiouser.

423
00:38:44,118 --> 00:38:45,585
Who are you, madam?

424
00:38:47,898 --> 00:38:49,743
I hardly know sir, just at present.

425
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:51,492
Explain yourself.

426
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,179
I can't explain myself, sir.
Because I'm not myself you see.

427
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,150
I don't see. Not at all, ma'am.

428
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:00,838
I'm afraid I can't put
it much more clearly.

429
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:04,082
Being so many different sizes
in a day is very confusing.

430
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:06,050
What size do you want to be?

431
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:08,963
Well, I should like to
be a little larger, sir.

432
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,389
Three inches is such a wretched height.

433
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,611
It's a very good height
indeed .. three inches.

434
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:15,695
Wretched?

435
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:18,063
I wish you creatures
wouldn't be easily offended.

436
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:21,600
You .. who are you?
─ I don't know.

437
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:23,473
I can't seem to remember things.

438
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:25,545
Can't seem to remember things.

439
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:28,962
Recite: "You are old, Father William".

440
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:41,090
"You are old Father William,
the young man said."

441
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:44,431
"And your hair has become very white."

442
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:48,996
"And yes you incessantly
stand on your head."

443
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,533
"Do you think at your age it is right?"

444
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:54,741
It is right.

445
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:59,589
"In my youth, Father William
replied to his son."

446
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:03,044
"I feared it might injure my brain."

447
00:40:03,891 --> 00:40:07,514
"But now that I am perfectly
sure I have none."

448
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:11,261
"Why, I do it again and again."

449
00:40:12,363 --> 00:40:16,869
"You are old said the youth,
one would hardly suppose."

450
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:21,164
"That your eye was as steady as ever."

451
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,442
"Yet you balanced an eel
on the end of your nose."

452
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:32,256
"Which makes you so awfully clever."

453
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:37,635
"I have answered 3 questions.
And that is enough."

454
00:40:37,832 --> 00:40:41,015
"Said his father:
don't give yourself airs."

455
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,010
"Do you think I can listen
all day to such stuff?"

456
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:48,877
"Be off, or I'll kick you downstairs."

457
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,708
"Be off, of I'll kick you downstairs."

458
00:41:33,543 --> 00:41:35,127
"We're footmen, we're fish."

459
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:37,446
"We're fish and then we're footmen."

460
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:39,332
"We're footmen, then we're fish."

461
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,208
"We're glassy-eyed, we gratify
the master's every wish."

462
00:41:43,478 --> 00:41:46,541
"For when there is work to be done."

463
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:50,409
"When there's a task to assign."

464
00:41:51,423 --> 00:41:53,368
"The first tells the second."

465
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:55,291
"The second tells the third."

466
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:57,206
"The third tells the fourth."

467
00:41:57,506 --> 00:41:58,956
"The fourth tells the fifth."

468
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:02,057
"And so on down the line."

469
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:05,964
"When someone trips with the roast."

470
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,831
"When there's a fly in the wine."

471
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,784
"The first blames the second."

472
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:14,857
"The second blames the third."

473
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:16,735
"The third blames the fourth."

474
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:18,326
"The fourth blames the fifth."

475
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,334
"It's someone's fault, not mine."

476
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:26,267
"And so on down the line."

477
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:30,199
"Although we all look similar,
the difference lies in rank."

478
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:32,654
"Apart from these ahead in line."

479
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,599
"Until you all deserve the law."

480
00:42:36,904 --> 00:42:38,612
"The footman protocol."

481
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,434
"We think towards .. this protocol."

482
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:45,848
"It's small .. but all we've got."

483
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:49,967
"So, every fish in his place."

484
00:42:51,563 --> 00:42:54,014
"Works by the time for design."

485
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:57,026
"The first works the second."

486
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,083
"The second works the third."

487
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:00,822
"The third works the fourth."

488
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:02,530
"The fourth works the fifth."

489
00:43:02,715 --> 00:43:05,984
"And so we all comply."

490
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:09,145
"Through all ninety-nine."

491
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:12,440
"The last one down the line."

492
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,780
"Down the line!"

493
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,664
For the Duchess.
An invitation from the Queen.

494
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:28,092
To play croquet.

495
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:30,780
From the Queen?
An invitation for the Duchess?

496
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,109
To play croquet.

497
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:37,145
"We're fish and then we're footmen."

498
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:39,503
"We're footmen, then we're fish."

499
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,282
Footmen.

500
00:43:41,612 --> 00:43:42,408
Fish.

501
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:43,753
Footmen.

502
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:45,037
Fish.

503
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,094
Those couldn't be the queen's
tarts by any chance?

504
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:15,023
Please sir, you won't tell Her Majesty.

505
00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:17,388
Tell her what?

506
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:19,613
You didn't steal them.

507
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:21,646
Haven't you heard?

508
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:23,989
They were stolen by a stranger.

509
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:32,272
There is no sort of use in knocking.

510
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,318
That's for two reasons.

511
00:44:38,945 --> 00:44:41,963
The first is because I'm on the
same side of the door as you are.

512
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:51,869
Secondly, because they're
making such a noise inside ..

513
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,338
No-one can possibly hear .. hear you.

514
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:57,321
Perhaps you can tell me?

515
00:44:57,801 --> 00:45:00,452
[ Whistling ]

516
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,588
There might be some sense in your
knocking if we had the door between us.

517
00:45:05,974 --> 00:45:09,621
For instance, if you were inside you may
knock and I could let you out you know.

518
00:45:09,861 --> 00:45:12,121
It's really dreadful the way
all you creatures argue.

519
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,788
I shall sit here.

520
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,169
Here until tomorrow.

521
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,421
Or next day, maybe.

522
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,342
How am I to get in?
─ Are you to get in at all?

523
00:45:22,046 --> 00:45:24,032
That's the first question, you know.

524
00:45:24,985 --> 00:45:27,156
What am I to do?
─ Anything you like.

525
00:45:27,632 --> 00:45:29,566
It's enough to drive one crazy.

526
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:56,207
"Speak roughly to your little boy
and beat him when he sneezes."

527
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:02,444
"He only does it to annoy."

528
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:09,769
"Because he knows it teases."

529
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:13,917
Wow! Wow! Wow!  Wow! Wow! Wow!

530
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,337
Wow! Wøw! Wow!

531
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:20,047

01:01:17,911 --> 01:01:19,477
Play the game!

710
01:01:25,323 --> 01:01:26,465
Off with his head.

711
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:30,610
I can't cut off a head unless
there is a body to cut it from.

712
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,095
I've never had to do
such a thing before.

713
01:01:33,175 --> 01:01:35,640
And I'm not going to
begin at my time of life.

714
01:01:36,148 --> 01:01:38,497
Anything that has a
head can be beheaded.

715
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:39,726
All I say is ..

716
01:01:39,806 --> 01:01:42,293
If something isn't done about
it in less than no time ..

717
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,981
I'll have everybody executed!
All round!

718
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:49,792
There my dear. It's head is off.

719
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,501
Are you like the Queen?

720
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,937
Not at all. She's so extremely ..

721
01:02:09,223 --> 01:02:11,969
Likely to win that it's hardly
worthwhile finishing the game.

722
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,889
You may have a cherry tart my child.

723
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:22,627
Why, there are no
tarts there, Your Majesty.

724
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:24,782
Nonsense. There must be.
I made them myself.

725
01:02:25,168 --> 01:02:26,945
But they are gone, my dear.

726
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:31,075
Of course the tarts have gone
Your Majesty. They have been stolen.

727
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:32,765
Stolen?

728
01:02:33,322 --> 01:02:35,296
My tarts stolen?

729
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:37,803
Someone shall suffer for this.

730
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:40,529
Off with his head! Off with his head!

731
01:02:40,905 --> 01:02:43,030
Off with his head! Off with his head!

732
01:02:43,518 --> 01:02:44,876
Off with his head!

733
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:48,090
Before we are entirely
depopulated my dear.

734
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:49,893
Hadn't you better find out who did it?

735
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:52,499
Yes, yes. Who did it? Who did it?

736
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:54,369
She did it!

737
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:56,043
Off with her head!

738
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,042
My dear, she has to stand trial first.

739
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:09,386
Why do we need a trial?
All I want is to chop off her head.

740
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,639
Not without a trial.

741
01:03:12,007 --> 01:03:13,313
Fair play, you know.

742
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,623
She shall stand trial.

743
01:03:16,124 --> 01:03:18,931
And then .. we'll chop off her head.

744
01:03:19,555 --> 01:03:21,235
Yes .. that's fair.

745
01:03:21,429 --> 01:03:23,649
Up .. you lazy thing.

746
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:32,686
What fun .. come on.

747
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:57,072
What fun.

748
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:05,154
What fun.

749
01:04:05,932 --> 01:04:06,986
What <i>is</i> the fun?

750
01:04:07,066 --> 01:04:10,914
Why, you are going to be
executed at sunrise, you are.

751
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:12,607
Sunrise?

752
01:04:12,687 --> 01:04:15,994
Yes, they always execute
people at sunrise. They do.

753
01:04:17,294 --> 01:04:20,433
Who will help me? I've got
to tell my story to someone.

754
01:04:20,697 --> 01:04:21,811
Tell it to him.

755
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:23,455
Ha ha ha ha.

756
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:28,085
She wants to tell you her story, she do.

757
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:29,993
You see, I ..

758
01:04:30,123 --> 01:04:32,331
First, I will tell you mine.

759
01:04:32,913 --> 01:04:34,343
Don't speak a word.

760
01:04:34,699 --> 01:04:37,391
Either of you, until I've finished.

761
01:04:39,412 --> 01:04:41,958
I don't see how he can ever
finish if he doesn't begin.

762
01:04:52,162 --> 01:04:54,830
Who are you?
─ I was a real turtle.

763
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,344
Now, I'm a mock turtle.

764
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,019
What is a mock turtle?

765
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:02,977
The thing mock turtle soup is made of.

766
01:05:13,588 --> 01:05:16,719
"Beautiful soup."

767
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:22,336
"So rich and green."

768
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:26,823
"Waiting in a .."

769
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:31,366
"Hot tureen."

770
01:05:32,198 --> 01:05:36,636
"Who for such dainties .."

771
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:41,810
"Would not stoop?"

772
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:48,997
"Soup of the evening."

773
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:53,653
"Beautiful soup."

774
01:05:55,883 --> 01:06:02,266
"Soup of the evening."

775
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:06,512
"Beautiful."

776
01:06:07,312 --> 01:06:11,171
"Soup."

777
01:06:25,638 --> 01:06:31,182
"Beautiful soup."

778
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:39,319
"Beautiful soup."

779
01:06:39,891 --> 01:06:50,188
Soup .. of .. the .. evening."

780
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,356
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."

781
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:08,384
"Beautiful."

782
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:16,509
"Soup."

783
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:27,125
"Will you walk a little faster",
said the whiting to a snail."

784
01:07:27,296 --> 01:07:30,760
"There's a porpoise just behind us,
and he's treading on my tail."

785
01:07:30,938 --> 01:07:34,275
"See how eagerly the lobsters
and the turtles all advance."

786
01:07:34,537 --> 01:07:38,000
"They are waiting on the shingle.
Will you come and join the dance?"

787
01:07:38,452 --> 01:07:41,673
"Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you, want you join the dance?"

788
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:45,480
"Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you, will you join the dance?"

789
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:53,292
[ Trumpet ]

790
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:05,563
King and Queen of Hearts.

791
01:08:17,946 --> 01:08:19,936
Consider our verdict.

792
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:23,638
Not yet. Not yet. There is a great
deal to come before that.

793
01:08:23,903 --> 01:08:25,545
I will read it out.

794
01:08:30,185 --> 01:08:32,593
"The Queen of Hearts,
she baked her tarts."

795
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:35,374
"All on a summer's day."

796
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:38,174
"The Queen of Hearts,
she baked her tarts."

797
01:08:38,734 --> 01:08:41,275
"All on a summer's day."

798
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:46,380
Gentlemen of the jury.

799
01:08:46,635 --> 01:08:49,547
The tarts have been stolen.

800
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:51,342
Who stole them?

801
01:08:52,626 --> 01:08:54,304
Call the first witness.

802
01:08:54,675 --> 01:08:56,249
First witness.

803
01:09:02,189 --> 01:09:04,144
I beg pardon, Your Majesty.

804
01:09:04,592 --> 01:09:06,053
For bringing this in.

805
01:09:07,274 --> 01:09:10,546
But I hadn't quite finished my
tea when I was sent for.

806
01:09:10,872 --> 01:09:13,452
Write that down. It's very important.

807
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,624
Give your evidence.

808
01:09:16,704 --> 01:09:19,489
And don't be nervous,
or I'll have you executed.

809
01:09:19,692 --> 01:09:20,697
Hold these.

810
01:09:21,586 --> 01:09:25,385
I hadn't begun my tea,
not over a week or so.

811
01:09:25,665 --> 01:09:28,516
And what with the bread
and butter getting so thin.

812
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:32,000
And the March Hare said ..
─ No I didn't.

813
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,035
You did.
─ I didn't.

814
01:09:34,331 --> 01:09:36,716
He denies it. Leave out that part.

815
01:09:37,446 --> 01:09:39,608
What happened after that?
─ After that?

816
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,719
I cut them more bread and butter.

817
01:09:41,942 --> 01:09:43,289
Here, here.

818
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:45,294
You may go.

819
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:52,363
"Twinkle, twinkle little bat."

820
01:09:52,944 --> 01:09:56,220
"How I wonder what you're at."

821
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,077
Off with that dormouse's head!

822
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:05,059
Allow me.
─ Thank you.

823
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:06,493
Perfectly alright.

824
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,599
Gentlemen of the jury.

825
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:14,530
Call the next witness.

826
01:10:15,743 --> 01:10:18,791
Never mind the witness.
Let's get to the execution.

827
01:10:18,984 --> 01:10:21,315
Very well. Bring in the accused.

828
01:10:22,037 --> 01:10:23,133
Alice, I believe.

829
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:24,369
Here.

830
01:10:26,146 --> 01:10:28,532
Now then, what do you
know about this business?

831
01:10:28,778 --> 01:10:29,564
Nothing.

832
01:10:29,644 --> 01:10:31,761
Write that down. It's very important.

833
01:10:31,988 --> 01:10:34,602
"Unimportant" Your Majesty
means, of course.

834
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:36,885
"Unimportant" of course I meant.

835
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:38,567
Important. Unimportant.

836
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:40,624
Important. Unimportant.

837
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:52,212
Rule 42.

838
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,539
All persons more than a
mile high to leave the court.

839
01:10:54,619 --> 01:10:56,040
I'm not a mile high.
─ You are!

840
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,598
Nearly two miles high!
─ That's not a regular rule.

841
01:10:58,813 --> 01:11:01,113
You invented it just now.
─ It's the oldest rule in the book.

842
01:11:01,193 --> 01:11:02,626
Then it ought to be number one.

843
01:11:02,706 --> 01:11:05,551
Here, here.
─ Throw that dormouse out!

844
01:11:11,277 --> 01:11:13,436
Your Majesty, this paper
has just been picked up.

845
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:14,482
What's in it?

846
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,870
I haven't read it yet, but
it's written by the prisoner.

847
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,296
That isn't my handwriting.

848
01:11:18,771 --> 01:11:21,215
She must have imitated
someone else's hand.

849
01:11:21,648 --> 01:11:24,965
That proves her guilt. Off with ..
─ Read it.

850
01:11:25,898 --> 01:11:28,777
Where shall I begin
please, Your Majesty?

851
01:11:29,478 --> 01:11:31,398
Begin at the beginning.

852
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:34,139
Go on until you come to the end.

853
01:11:35,153 --> 01:11:36,649
Then .. stop.

854
01:11:40,628 --> 01:11:42,834
They told me you had been to
her and mentioned me to him.

855
01:11:43,072 --> 01:11:45,253
She gave me a good character
but said I could not swim.

856
01:11:45,632 --> 01:11:48,032
He sent them word I had not gone.
We know it to be true.

857
01:11:48,112 --> 01:11:50,382
If she should push the matter on,
what would become of you?

858
01:11:50,462 --> 01:11:52,846
I gave her one, they gave him two.
You gave us three or more.

859
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:55,386
They all returned from him to you.
Though they were mine before.

860
01:11:55,466 --> 01:11:57,921
If I or she should chance to
be involved in this affair.

861
01:11:58,089 --> 01:12:00,475
He trusts you to set them
free, exactly as we were.

862
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:03,231
My notion was that you had
been before she had this fit.

863
01:12:03,429 --> 01:12:06,024
An obstacle that came between
him, and ourselves, and it.

864
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,758
Don't let him know she liked
them best, for this must ever be.

865
01:12:08,919 --> 01:12:11,371
A secret, kept from all the rest,
between yourself and me.

866
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,037
That's the most important
piece of evidence.

867
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:16,305
And you know what that means!

868
01:12:16,519 --> 01:12:18,820
I don't believe there is
an atom of meaning in it.

869
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:21,606
Let the jury consider the verdict.

870
01:12:21,798 --> 01:12:24,400
No. Let them consider the charge.

871
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:33,314
"The Queen of Hearts, she baked
some tarts, all on a summer's day."

872
01:12:33,675 --> 01:12:36,474
"The Knave of Hearts,
she stole the tarts."

873
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:39,057
"And took them quite away."

874
01:12:39,367 --> 01:12:41,475
It's perfectly true what she says.

875
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,351
The Knave of Hearts <i>did</i> steal the tarts.

876
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:46,203
He did?

877
01:12:47,003 --> 01:12:50,485
Only .. <i>she</i> .. is the Knave of Hearts.

878
01:12:50,672 --> 01:12:51,837
Then, who are you?

879
01:12:52,361 --> 01:12:54,263
I am .. Alice.

880
01:12:55,929 --> 01:12:56,980
Stuff and nonsense!

881
01:12:57,138 --> 01:12:58,812
Hold your tongue!
─ I won't!

882
01:12:59,056 --> 01:13:00,112
Off with her head.

883
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:02,153
"Off with her head, off with her head!"

884
01:13:04,617 --> 01:13:06,389
No! Who cares for you?

885
01:13:06,959 --> 01:13:08,589
You are nothing but a pack of cards.

886
01:13:14,947 --> 01:13:18,422
At this, the whole pack rose up into
the air and came flying down upon her.

887
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:22,279
She gave a little scream.
Not of fright nor with anger.

888
01:13:23,038 --> 01:13:23,699
Oh.

889
01:13:25,906 --> 01:13:27,333
Then, what happened to Alice?

890
01:13:28,384 --> 01:13:29,171
Well.

891
01:13:29,884 --> 01:13:32,019
Alice found herself lying on the bank,

892
01:13:32,312 --> 01:13:33,943
Her head in the lap of her sister.

893
01:13:34,687 --> 01:13:39,117
And was gently brushing away dead leaves
that had fluttered down upon her face.

894
01:13:40,186 --> 01:13:43,119
"Oh, I've had such a
curious dream", said Alice.

895
01:13:43,862 --> 01:13:44,591
A dream?

896
01:13:45,357 --> 01:13:46,086
A dream?

897
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:49,997
No, no. It was real, it was real.

898
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,656
But Mr Dodgson.

899
01:14:03,414 --> 01:14:05,201
It <i>was</i> all real, wasn't it?

900
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:07,874
Naturally.

901
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:59,223
T-G
