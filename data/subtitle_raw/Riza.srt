1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,644
To my father...

2
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,730
Couldn't you sleep again?

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,010
Count the sheep!

4
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,841
- So what do you want me to do?
- That's it. There is no money.

5
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,521
The truck is lying there.

6
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,922
So?

7
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,246
I couldn't find the money.

8
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,485
You couldn't find it?

9
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,644
So you're telling me,
'If I can't find the

10
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,407
money from somewhere and can'!
make..

11
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,961
...The truck repaired I
will lose the truck'

12
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,088
- Is it right?
- That's right.

13
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,522
Right...

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,047
You also have promissory note.

15
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,961
Mortgage.-

16
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,807
You have promissory note?
Did I get it correctly?

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes, I have.

18
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,011
For how many years
do you know me?

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,041
- I don'! know. 10 years, I guess.
- Probably.

20
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,651
Or maybe more.

21
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,086
So...you know me well.

22
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,846
I know you too.

23
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,202
And I know you as
<i>a</i> man with good memory.

24
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,122
Why?

25
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,721
Why?

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,328
Look, your name is written here.
Do you remember'?

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,601
Don't you?

28
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,281
You remember your
debts to other people, though.

29
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,529
The crank is broken.
On the way to Istanbul.

30
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,964
I swear to God,
the crank is broken.

31
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,609
We dragged it here like a corpse.

32
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,127
It awaits to be repaired in the garage.

33
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,562
Brother, he doesn't
repair if I won'! pay 10 thousand.

34
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,807
He wants all in cash.

35
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,804
He wants the money first. Otherwise,
the mechanic doesn't start to repair.

36
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,691
Brother, I know.
I have to pay you, too. I know.

37
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,182
Brother, listen, I know
I delayed the payment.

38
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:43,003
I have done it before, too.

39
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,724
Truck is full with all goods.

40
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,604
I can'! take my money, either.
I'm begging you.

41
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,371
Mahmut, bro. You don'! listen.
I swear to God.

42
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,121
The crank is broken.

43
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,363
What can I do?
Did I brake it myself or what?!

44
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,651
Bro, I know, I'm late for the payment.
Wait another month, please.

45
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,010
Just a month.

46
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,124
Can'! you postpone just <i>a</i> month?

47
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,761
OK, bro. All right.

48
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Lottery tickets.

49
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,128
Lottery tickets.
Anybody else?

50
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,564
<i>There will be a prolongation.</i>

51
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,687
<i>Portugal is attacking.
Simao hit the ball.</i>

52
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,566
<i>No one is following the ball.</i>

53
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,443
Selam Aleykoum.
ls Selahattin here?

54
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,847
He is dead.

55
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,921
Selam Aleykoum people.

56
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,121
- Selam Aleykoum.
- Well?

57
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,641
- The mechanic asks for 10 thousand.
- Too much. What are you going to do?

58
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,571
The truck is there,
like <i>a</i> corpse.

59
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,565
I don't know what to do, either.

60
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,121
Are you making calculation?

61
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,890
I can'! calculate <i>a</i> shit.

62
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,682
You're right.
You can't.

63
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

64
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,728
Find somewhere else to sleep.

65
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,566
I'm going to bed

66
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,248
- What brought you here?
- I just came.

67
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,971
I brought some
goods from Adana.

68
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,404
- You brought some goods?
- Yes, I did.

69
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,087
Why did you come here?

70
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,761
Laundry.

71
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,721
Aren't you going to weigh it?

72
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,640
Are you surprised to see me?

73
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,284
- You have no shame, don't you?
- You're surprised.

74
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,801
I am.

75
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,890
- You haven'! changed a bit. You know?
- Bastard.

76
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,247
You haven'! changed at all.

77
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,607
- Fuck you!
- You haven'! changed at all.

78
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,681
So, I just came into your head.
Is that so? After all this time?

79
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,601
I told you not to
come here in the first place.

80
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,242
- Don't you think it was long before?
- You forgot, of course.

81
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,089
- I didn't forget everything.
- Nor did I.

82
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,083
I told you not to come here.
Never.

83
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,001
What? Your paralyzed husband
got well or what? He comes here now.

84
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,042
Fuck off!

85
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,809
- I never forgot, you know?
- Gel the hell out of here!

86
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,410
I say go! Go to hell!

87
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,484
3 kilos. 4,5 Liras.

88
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,686
- Name?
- Ali.

89
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,009
You're here finally.
I thought you would never come

90
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,084
- Traffic. I was stuck in the traffic.
- Same old story.

91
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,890
I swear I was.
It started at Aksaray.

92
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,884
They came to pick
Kadakal Hotel's laundry up.

93
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,041
Then, the guy called and
said there were two sheets missing.

94
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,968
I'll take care of it.

95
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,683
- What?
- Why? What happened?

96
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,929
- Why are you staring at?
- Who is staring?

97
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,242
Your mother.

98
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,723
- Do I look bad?
- No, why?

99
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,961
You look at me as I look bad.

100
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,529
No, I didn't look like this.

101
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,204
Didn't you quit smoking?

102
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,402
You repeal the same thing every time.
I didn't quit.

103
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,247
- Do it then.
- OK. I will.

104
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,724
- Is there something wrong?
- No. Why did you ask?

105
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,330
I don't know.
It seems so.

106
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,930
No, there is nothing wrong.

107
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,130
Do you need anything? Money?
Something else?

108
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,209
No. I need nothing.
I just came to see you.

109
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,804
- Really?
- I swear, I don't.

110
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,482
Why don't you sell that store?
A launderette among guys.

111
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,607
You are stuck there.

112
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,321
Don't start again

113
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,082
Bekir asks you
if you need anything or not.

114
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,980
- Thank him for me.
I like my brother-in-law.

115
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,880
- He says you should
come to us more often

116
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,086
OK. I will.

117
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,261
- Look. I put my cigarette
out as you asked.

118
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,081
- It's bad for you, not for me.

119
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,325
Bad for your lungs.

120
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,361
I better leave
and you go back to work.

121
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,209
I'm sure foreman
has already started to complain

122
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,329
- The workshop will be closed.
- What?

123
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,011
They are closing it.
Al the end of this month.

124
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,928
Really?

125
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,881
- I'm going to be unemployed again.
Again.

126
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:19,321
- You find another one.
Don't worry.

127
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,365
When?
Who knows when?

128
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,728
No. Not like this, mom.
Fine, everything is fine. Thank God.

129
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,362
I'm going to send you
some money next week.

130
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,763
Hopefully next week.
OK? I told you, I

131
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:27,085
will start to work in
the factory, anyway.

132
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,725
They told me to begin in two weeks.

133
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,050
The foreman saw me.

134
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,181
He said OK and also told me to
wail for <i>a</i> little bit.

135
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,961
He said no problem for the job.

136
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,962
They offer insurance
and everything, mom.

137
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:44,044
Don'! say anything to dad yet.

138
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,888
First, I start to work,
we will inform he, then

139
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,563
No, mom,
I'm not living in the streets.

140
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,967
Don'! worry.

141
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,884
The phone costs too much.

142
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,806
Yes, I'm hanging up, now.
Pass my regards to everyone, mom.

143
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,485
I kiss you and all.
Say hello to everybody.

144
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,005
All right, Hang up, now.

145
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,682
- How much?
- Look what is written on the counter.

146
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,121
4. ..5. ...
- 4,5 Liras.

147
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,800
It's too much.
Outside calling costs 3 Liras maximum.

148
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,363
Don't call, then.
Or call from somewhere else.

149
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,248
Listen.
What's this job in the factory story?

150
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,924
Everyone finds his match, right?

151
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,681
- What? Do you think so?
- Yes, I do.

152
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,923
If you say so, all right then.

153
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,371
- You're <i>a</i> driver, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

154
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,011
I used to be <i>a</i> driver. I quit.

155
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,406
- Why?
- I crashed someone like you did now.

156
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,165
I can't sleep, you know?

157
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,642
No, I don't know.

158
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,246
My friend, no!

159
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,160
Do you want some tea?

160
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,641
The old man upstairs,
is always watching TV, you know?

161
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,203
- You mean Uncle Muhittin?
- Yes, he is.

162
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,168
When you watch TV,
you forget everything else.

163
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,131
He is wailing for his son to come
and pick him up, you know?

164
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,683
- So, he'll wait for.
- What are you waiting fol'?

165
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,282
Nothing.

166
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,367
There are so many drivers come
and go, you know?

167
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,726
I have been in this hotel
more than anybody else.

168
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,087
Brother?
ls your truck big?

169
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,209
You're cheerful again,
aren't you, Brother Musa?

170
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,965
What?
The ship didn't return yet?

171
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,001
He's <i>a</i> nice guy.

172
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,484
He got the tape and the goggles
in gambling from a Russian.

173
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,760
He travels the seas like this.

174
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,090
He's going to take me
on his ship, you know?

175
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,850
I swear.
He travels the seven seas.

176
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,327
He's going to take me.

177
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,201
- Do you think we will
enter to European Union?

178
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:09,522
- What?

179
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,130
If we will,
there would be jobs.

180
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,845
There won'! be a shit.

181
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,249
- Brother Riza, come to drink tea.
- Friend. Come.

182
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,881
Come to drink tea.

183
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,687
Selam Aleykoum.

184
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,203
Their tea is different.
Drink it. It's good.

185
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,046
- Chauffeur.
- Chauffeur.

186
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,806
Name?

187
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,124
He's asking your name.
Tell him.

188
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,847
Riza.

189
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,246
His name is Gulam.

190
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,008
He came from Kabul.
He has a store.

191
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,810
He owns <i>a</i> restaurant in Kabul.

192
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,561
His son.

193
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,242
They are illegal immigrants.
He has his daughter-in-law with him.

194
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,679
His son ?ed to Italy.
They came here.

195
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,523
They will go after him

196
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,081
Poor people.
They have <i>a</i> desolate life.

197
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,040
Lottery.
The big day is tomorrow.

198
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,646
- Give me one.
- Good appetite.

199
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,887
- Good luck. Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

200
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,811
Are you crazy, or what?
Let me go!

201
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,607
Let me go!

202
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,124
Let me go. Are you nuts?
Let me go!

203
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,880
Shout out so the neighbors
can hear you well!

204
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,928
Fuck!

205
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,485
- Didn't you miss me?
- Fuck off!

206
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,248
Fuck you!

207
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,881
I need money.

208
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,168
Money?

209
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,010
My truck...it's broken.
I couldn't find money.

210
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,927
Your truck?!

211
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,324
Yes, my truck...
the crank is broken.

212
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,402
I'll lose it if I can't
find ten thousand.

213
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,481
I went everywhere.
I knocked every door.

214
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,970
I wouldn't have come to you
if it weren't my last hope.

215
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,767
You're talking about your truck!

216
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,804
You're telling me your truck,
without any shame!

217
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,960
I have nothing else.

218
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,811
Selam Aleykoum

219
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,650
Give me the money!
Give it to me! All of it.

220
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,243
You're surprised, aren't you?!
You, motherfucker!

221
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,408
- Selam Aleykoum, my friend.
- Aleykoum selam.

222
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,407
- Selam Aleykoum Gulam.
- Aleykoum selam. Friend.

223
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,767
What's up?
What are you doing?

224
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,927
20...

225
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,645
40, one more 60. It's OK

226
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,002
Good night.

227
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,487
Friend.

228
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,130
Friend?

229
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,925
It's been late and you're still in bed.
Are you sick?

230
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,805
- What time is it?
- Five.

231
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,643
I was worried about you as
I didn't see you up until now.

232
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,006
- Tell again what time it is.
- Five. Five in the afternoon

233
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,302
- I have a terrible headache.

234
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:22,804
- Do you want me to
bring you some aspirin?

235
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,682
Here.

236
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,128
All right.

237
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,127
- You have fever?

238
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,209
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

239
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,641
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat something?

240
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,845
Listen, I'm here.
If you need something...

241
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,207
OK, come back in 10 days.

242
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,769
- One week.
- I'll try.

243
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,322
You'll try what?
One week.

244
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,522
I hope so.

245
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,331
You don't need to hope.
One week.

246
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,648
- What? Are you leaving?
- Yes.

247
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,320
Why is this rush?

248
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,603
The truck is repaired.
I'm loading goods tonight.

249
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,402
So, you're loading goods.
Fine.

250
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,331
Give me the bill.

251
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,644
Brother Feyzullah!
Feyzullah!

252
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,124
- What? What happened?
- Come here, brother!

253
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:46,250
I haven't seen him for a couple of days
But I didn't see it coming.

254
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,130
You haven'! checked them?
You should have worried.

255
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,728
Why should I?
I'm not going to control them, am I?

256
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,643
She doesn't go out anyway.

257
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,164
She is sick.
I have already told you.

258
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,366
Where is this alleged father?

259
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,290
He just got the fuck out
of her and left her to us

260
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,648
- Maybe he is in Italy now.
- He is certainly is.

261
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,562
He didn't seem to be such <i>a</i> guy.
It never came to my mind.

262
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,408
I don't know.
Maybe something else happened.

263
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,920
Maybe the cops caught him.

264
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,208
Aren't they illegal?
All illegal.

265
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,487
The oops might have caught him.
They are illegal immigrants, anyway.

266
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,131
Certainly something else happened
He will come back.

267
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,407
You say so?

268
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:37,761
Yes, something else should
have happened. Isn't she sick?

269
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,886
What if she will again...

270
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,405
<i>Should we call a doctor'?</i>

271
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,490
What doctor'?
Don'! be silly. Freak!

272
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,250
What if she dies?

273
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,728
Come on.

274
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,007
She is hungry.

275
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,564
Look she is fine.
She is all right.

276
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,724
I warn you anyway.

277
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,246
Fuck!

278
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,802
She peed in it.

279
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,130
Yes, she did.
She didn't go out of her room.

280
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,767
My goodness!
What am I going to do with her now?

281
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,007
Let's call the police.

282
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,531
Right. Let's call them,
so they could close this place.

283
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,608
You nuts!

284
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,405
Don't you know anybody?
An acquaintance or something?

285
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,766
How should I know?

286
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,763
You were chatting with the
bastard all the time.

287
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,091
Nonsense.
There was no chat or anything.

288
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,931
MY goodness!

289
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,045
What am I going to do with it?

290
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,611
Fuck! Are you still here?

291
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,401
Why are you here?

292
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,967
I don't have money.

293
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,001
- I didn't come for the money.
- Why did you come then?

294
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,242
- To see.
- To see what?

295
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,248
Nothing.

296
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,841
I'm sorry.

297
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,440
I'm sorry, OK?

298
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,129
I don't want anyone
but Russian broads.

299
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,850
- But how was the broad of last night?
- God bless you.

300
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,564
- Listen, call me, OK?
- Bye.

301
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,844
Isn't the cleaning finished yet?

302
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,202
What's up?

303
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,850
- Why did the cop was here?
- He's my friend.

304
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,851
- Why did you come back?
- It had to be like this.

305
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,605
Do you believe in sin?

306
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:36,848
What?

307
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,246
Well, I do.

308
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,566
So?

309
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,245
There is a place called hell.

310
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,007
I don't know.

311
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,042
I'm sorry if I bother you, OK?

312
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,645
Do you understand?

313
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,006
I came to say well...

314
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,487
Do you understand me?

315
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,963
I thought you
would go back to your home.

316
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,806
You would, wouldn't you?

317
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,126
Would you want to
go back home? Home.

318
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,321
To Afghanistan?

319
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,566
Would you
want to go to Afghanistan? Home?

320
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,442
Do you understand me?
Would you?

321
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,368
Go home?

322
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,002
Do you understand me?

323
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,087
Home?

324
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,602
Would you go if
I buy your ticket? Home?

325
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,567
Afghanistan?

326
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,840
My name is Riza.

327
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,767
What's yours?

328
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,564
I buy <i>a</i> ticket and...
you go home.

329
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,162
You better go back.

330
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,482
Is that your husband?

331
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,088
Enough!
Aren't you going to stop following me?

332
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,964
- I'm sorry. I came to talk to you.
- About what?

333
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,800
I'm sorry. Al the moment
I'm a bit confused. Well, I'm...

334
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:57,768
You what?

335
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,885
Bad. I'm really bad.
Shall we drink tea over there?

336
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,481
- I've got things to do.
I have to go home.

337
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:05,562
- Just for five minutes.

338
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,959
Tell me whatever
you have to say, here.

339
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,485
What can I say to you
in the middle of the street?

340
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,649
Let's sit somewhere.
Just for five minutes.

341
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,722
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes.

342
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,326
- How is your husband? Is he well?
- What do you care?

343
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,209
- I just wondered.
- You wondered about Necip?

344
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:43,285
- Is this why you brought me here?
- No. I just wondered.

345
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,240
- How are you?
- And now is it my tum?

346
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,680
I'm fine. OK?

347
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,841
- I'm not, you know?
- It's obvious.

348
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,651
Sometimes, it seems to me, the more I
run, the more I go to opposite side.

349
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,289
- I couldn't escape. I'm not fine.
- Nobody is.

350
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,583
- Are you staying in
this filthy hotel again?

351
01:15:23,584 --> 01:15:24,965
- Yes.

352
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,083
- Feyzullah the bastard is still there?
- Yes he is. Everything is the same.

353
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,644
Faggot. He doesn't give
the linen any more. Asshole!

354
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:49,122
I told you before
but I want to say it again.

355
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,603
- I'm sorry, OK?
- What the hell are you talking about?

356
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,850
Nothing.
I just wanted to share with you.

357
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,647
To share?
What are you going to share with me?

358
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,687
I asked you to share with you before.
And what happened?

359
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,166
You got the hell
out of here one morning.

360
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,968
Did you care about me
as much as you do about your truck?

361
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,486
Tell me.

362
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,848
Did you? You forgot about me.
You left me and went away.

363
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,531
You are talking about sharing.
Fuck sharing!

364
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,486
- You're right, actually.
- Yes, I am right.

365
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,727
Of course I am So what?

366
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,762
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

367
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,521
- Where is your master'?
- He left.

368
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,483
- Where did he go?
- He said he has things to do.

369
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,928
- When will he come back?
- I don't know.

370
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,406
What's going on with my truck?

371
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,639
I don'! know exactly.

372
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,881
But I guess he's waiting for some
spare pieces or something.

373
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,320
Fuck the spare pieces.

374
01:18:17,321 --> 01:18:18,560
When is it going to
finish this bloody truck?

375
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,361
I don't know, I swear.
But I'll ask him when he comes

376
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,690
Stop it! Stop!

377
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,442
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

378
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,206
The guy here is
making very good tea.

379
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:39,723
- I give him my own tea to make.
- No, thanks, we won't have any.

380
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,086
That's the one
who will go, right?

381
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,561
Yes, that's her.

382
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,406
- What about you?
- No, she is the only one going.

383
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,726
Sorry to ask but who is she?
Does she understand what we're sharing?

384
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,927
She is someone.

385
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,326
- Is she Afghan?
- Yes. Her husband is in Italy.

386
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,649
- OK. Her husband is in Italy.
- Yes.

387
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,919
Our responsibility
is just to make them disembark.

388
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,127
After that,
it's the responsibility of other people.

389
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,408
- How could she go all alone?
- She won'! be alone.

390
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,326
There will be eighty people.
Half of them are women and children.

391
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,405
She'll take her food with her.

392
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,483
- Well, how much?
- 3,500 dollars.

393
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,485
Really?!

394
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,965
- And when will it be?
- In two days. On the 12th.

395
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:00,766
Sorry to ask but what is
the relationship between you two?

396
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,963
It's none of your business.
Why do you keep asking?

397
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,561
I'm sorry.
Just wondered.

398
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,321
This is the situation, my brother.

399
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,728
Good.

400
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,329
I wish you had never come here.

401
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,408
Hello?
Just a minute.

402
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,168
Hello.

403
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,282
Brother Riza.

404
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,330
You have <i>a</i> call.
Someone is asking for you.

405
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,488
Hello.

406
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,608
Of course,
I recognized your voice.

407
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,210
Hello.
I'm fine.

408
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,482
What?

409
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,206
Where?
Understood.

410
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,202
OK.

411
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,441
All right.
See you. OK.

412
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,968
Were you surprised
when I called you?

413
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,122
Yes, I wasn't expecting this.

414
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,865
- I just called.
And then, I regretted it.

415
01:26:25,866 --> 01:26:28,089
- Why?

416
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,249
I don't know. I thought 'What
would he think of it, now?

417
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,291
I didn't think of anything.

418
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,847
Didn't you?

419
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,007
No, I didn't

420
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,890
- Necip is dead.
- Necip is dead?

421
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,804
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

422
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,201
I didn't tell you.

423
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,888
I don't know.
I'm confused.

424
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,526
And then when
you came out of the blue...

425
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,440
I felt weird after he died

426
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,003
I felt relieved from wiping him up.

427
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,762
It's a shame, isn't it?
But I felt like this.

428
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,687
When I went home,
I found him dead.

429
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,809
I went later than usual.

430
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:44,206
I wandered around for a while.
It's like I fell it, you know?

431
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,964
But I didn't go home.
I didn't want to.

432
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,170
My feel didn't take me home.

433
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,881
Maybe he would be
alive if I went earlier.

434
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,329
He fell from bed,
he died in agony.

435
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,281
I knew it,
I knew at that moment.

436
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,083
I said to myself that he'd died.
That he'd died.

437
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,606
I had enough to wash
and dry his dirty pants

438
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,768
I always wanted to hang
out laundry that...

439
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,724
...I wouldn't be sick of its smell
I wanted to hang clean t-shirts.

440
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,760
...Sheets free from the urine to dry.

441
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,969
I know it's a sin
but that's the way it is.

442
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:44,051
- Why do you tell me all of this?
- I feel like I killed him.

443
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,288
What?

444
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:58,887
I killed him...but I don't feel
like it's a sin. I can't feel.

445
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,362
- You have changed.
- Have I?

446
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,641
Yes indeed.

447
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,041
Otherwise, I wouldn't
want to tell.

448
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:20,441
I couldn't tell anybody.
It's like a secret.

449
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,042
A <i>secret?</i>

450
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,008
I have no one to share with.

451
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,529
You don'! have either.
You don't even have a friend. Do you?

452
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:40,643
No, I don't...
So did you tell me your secret?

453
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,204
It's difficult to live with a sin

454
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,451
What are you doing now?

455
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:07,249
- Nothing.
- You look tired.

456
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,168
I don't know. Do I?

457
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,411
'Fired. I'm very tired too,
you know?

458
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,767
I got tired.

459
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,644
I want everything to change.

460
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:25,563
- Don'! you? Don't you seek for peace?
- What?

461
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,564
Don't you want
everything to be better?

462
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,522
Of course I would

463
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,402
Aren't you tired of driving?
You used to say you were.

464
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,041
I'm very tired.

465
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,647
Then sell this truck.
Do something else.

466
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,126
I can't sell it.
Everything is mortgaged.

467
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,963
This life will never change.
Ever. It won'! change.

468
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,729
Brother Riza, come.

469
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,850
- What happened?
- The Afghan is dead. He was killed.

470
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,929
He was killed in the street. Poor guy.

471
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,119
- How did it happen?
- They killed him.

472
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,929
How should I know?
It's unknown.

473
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,571
You didn't go to work.
They said you are sick.

474
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:07,486
- You didn't forget my address.
- I didn't.

475
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,207
I was.. .
I was <i>a</i> bit sick today.

476
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,804
That bastard said you were ill.

477
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,882
No, I'm fine now, actually.

478
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,289
- Do you want some tea?
- What? If it's already made.

479
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,042
It's boiling. I'll bring it.

480
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,731
Why did you come?

481
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,008
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

482
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:08,043
I'm scared, I guess.

483
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,008
Are you scared? Why?

484
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,202
I don't know.

485
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,686
- I'm going to ask from you something
if you don'! mind. -What?

486
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:26,880
- Can I sleep here?
- What?

487
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,642
Here, for <i>a</i> short while.

488
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,126
What's going on with the truck?

489
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:00,928
It's repaired.

490
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,122
Are you going to leave?

491
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,442
In the morning.

492
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,281
Brother Musa has left.

493
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,482
Good.
