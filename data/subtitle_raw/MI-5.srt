Shoot me or get out. I'm not taking that.

That's why I've taken the decision
out of your hands.

I had the rib of beef, too.

1017
01:36:15,012 --> 01:36:17,723
Tell me you're lying, Harry.

1018
01:36:18,266 --> 01:36:19,809
Please.

1019
01:36:19,892 --> 01:36:22,353
Tell me you didn't betray your country.

1020
01:36:25,898 --> 01:36:27,900
It's been four hours already, Geraldine.

1021
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,986
You can spend the last
two in a hospital bed,

1022
01:36:29,986 --> 01:36:34,657
but if I were you, I'd go and play
with that beautiful niece of yours.

1023
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:30,171
PEARCE: I hear Mace offered you a job.
Are you taking it?

1024
01:37:30,213 --> 01:37:32,006
HOLLOWAY: Thinking about it.

1025
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,260
Your message said
you had something to tell me.

1026
01:37:40,181 --> 01:37:43,684
They've put surveillance on Ruth's grave.
You can't go there any more.

1027
01:37:52,693 --> 01:37:56,823
I have something which, by rights,
should be yours.

1028
01:38:05,623 --> 01:38:08,376
Your father was wearing
it the night he died.

1029
01:38:09,168 --> 01:38:12,255
The Stasi stripped his body
of everything that could be useful

1030
01:38:12,338 --> 01:38:15,842
and it found its way
into an FSB archive somewhere.

1031
01:38:17,677 --> 01:38:20,221
He was wearing a wedding ring
on the night of his op?

1032
01:38:20,221 --> 01:38:22,223
Ordinarily, he wouldn't have.

1033
01:38:22,306 --> 01:38:24,976
But he'd just found out
he was to have a son.

1034
01:38:29,355 --> 01:38:33,025
I didn't decommission you
because you weren't good enough.

1035
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:35,194
After your father, I couldn't...

1036
01:38:36,696 --> 01:38:38,614
I had to protect you.

1037
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:42,744
The good ones tend not to last, Will.

1038
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:47,749
Then who does?

1039
01:38:50,334 --> 01:38:52,670
The ones like me.
