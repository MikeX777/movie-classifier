1
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,389
What about it, Komorov?

2
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,473
We're in deep shit.

3
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:50,237
Yes.

4
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,519
Blessed I'll be to receive God's gift.

5
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,459
His gift of free will
which makes us the master

6
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,323
of our own destiny.

7
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,250
But be careful, my children.

8
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't let ambition and
the thirst for knowledge

9
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,393
turn into arrogance.

10
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,863
We can not strive to
win over the holy power.

11
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:36,944
Those who are longing
for it will pay the price

12
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,453
and their soul will only be the beginning.

13
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,873
Such power is reserved
for God himself only.

14
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:02,559
And there will be no
absolution for those

15
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,473
who claim such power for themselves.

16
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,219
Hell itself will rise

17
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,936
and through the Four
Riders of the Apocalypse

18
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:17,433
become the whip of mankind.

19
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,700
I looked and behold a pale horse

20
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,460
and its name that
sat on him was Death,

21
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:35,578
and Hell followed with him.

22
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,187
Amen.

23
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:57,773
How did you find me?

24
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:03,323
Well, you're not
exactly invisible, are ya?

25
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,483
You shouldn't have come.

26
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,702
I wouldn't have come if I
didn't need your help, Heinrich.

27
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:10,849
This name belongs to
a life I left behind.

28
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,400
You should know that.

29
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,199
Yeah, but this is important.

30
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,683
I need your help.

31
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,010
Nothing you can
say will make me leave.

32
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,149
Komorov.

33
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,673
Victor's killer?

34
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,459
Hm, impossible.

35
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,233
It's possible.

36
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,669
My leads are reliable.

37
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,917
I just need you there
to help identify him.

38
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,649
This here is my mission
now, my last mission.

39
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,053
Bullshit.

40
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,459
You're tryin' to
save one soul at a time

41
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,329
to wash the blood off your hands.

42
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:51,819
You wanna save souls?

43
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,869
Come with me and save all the souls

44
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,823
on this goddamn godforsaken planet.

45
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,829
That makes us even.

46
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,203
You won't ever see me again.

47
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,799
Maybe.

48
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,010
I heard that.

49
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,673
Blessed are those
who long for justice.

50
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,450
They shall be pleased.

51
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,028
I'll be back.

52
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,680
Never underestimate your opponent

53
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:21,709
and never lose your concentration,

54
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,513
even when you think
the battle has won.

55
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,903
Your opponent may take
advantage of your mercy.

56
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,323
This is where knowing your
enemy becomes very important.

57
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,159
Appear weak when you are strong

58
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,869
and strong when you're weak.

59
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,273
All warfare is based on deception.

60
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,857
Sun Tzu, "The Art of War."

61
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,153
Stoker.

62
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,908
Class dismissed.

63
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:12,813
Hup!

64
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:26,672
Darwin.

65
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:40,885
For you.

66
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,680
All right, honey.

67
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,402
Run along now.

68
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:48,736
Okay, Daddy.

69
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,009
Well now who the hell's that?

70
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,689
Ain't nobody got this number.

71
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,190
Ain't got no idea.

72
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,431
It's me.

73
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,213
Well, horseshit.

74
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,163
What you want, Stoker?

75
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:27,459
Long time no see.

76
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,989
Not since the Espiritu Santo.

77
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,199
What's up, Zimmerman?

78
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,603
Look like you
gained a little weight.

79
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:38,839
Look who's talkin', old man.

80
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,549
I'm surprised you aren't
wearing any glasses.

81
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,079
Well, I usually hit what I aim at.

82
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,945
I don't need to see it.

83
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,279
How 'bout you?

84
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,710
Hey, I never doubted
you for a minute.

85
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,013
Hey, John.

86
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,228
Are you finally finished here?

87
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,333
Gimme 10 minutes.

88
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,603
Well let's say 15.

89
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,083
Yeah, yeah, right.

90
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,449
What do you think?

91
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,053
Yeah, yeah, you still
got it, baby girl.

92
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,819
That's the newest
explosives from our company.

93
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,069
No shit?

94
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,229
That big explosion came
from a little girl like you?

95
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,989
I figure with the
right gear we could carry

96
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,369
more explosives than
on our last mission.

97
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,703
We?

98
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,289
Who said anything about we?

99
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,009
I just came here to say goodbye.

100
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,529
We went over this last time.

101
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,299
You can't keep protecting me.

102
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,269
No, no, this mission
is much too dangerous.

103
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,069
How can you tell me
you're going to capture

104
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,909
my father's killer and then
expect me to just sit at home?

105
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,460
You know something?

106
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:25,447
You're just like your
father, ornery and stubborn.

107
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,657
You coming or not?

108
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,187
So, you wanna play, little man?

109
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,933
I gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed.

110
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,447
You can take a lot more
than most other people.

111
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,313
Maybe you're into pain.

112
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,253
Whatever.

113
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,583
We got all the time in the world.

114
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,177
And then at the end,
I will break you.

115
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:51,910
You are gonna tell
me whatever I want.

116
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:57,616
Please, can I have my gag back?

117
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:03,663
Your wish is my command.

118
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,003
You want more pain?

119
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,830
You shall have it.

120
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,949
What you doing
laying around here for?

121
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,413
We've got work to do.

122
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,543
Yeah, tell me about it.

123
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,859
Uh-huh.

124
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,063
Oh, you don't have to be
able to travel into Belgium.

125
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,790
Way too known over here.

126
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:54,026
No, we got all the people we need.

127
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,329
Howdy, y'all.

128
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,986
Darwin.

129
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:44,029
In the flesh.

130
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,573
Look around ya.

131
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,099
Everything of what
you see is nowhere,

132
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,329
and y'all in the middle of it.

133
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,663
Here.

134
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,013
Synchronize now.

135
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,549
Radiation's got it so that we

136
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,449
can't be here longer than 36 hours.

137
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,219
Of course, unless you
wanna glow in the dark.

138
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,039
What kind of place is this?

139
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,769
This used to be a
Soviet mining facility.

140
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,229
Guess they were excavating
shit until that one

141
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,699
fine April day when they
decided to quit outta the blue.

142
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,100
The catastrophe?

143
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,039
Well, whatever happened
happened a couple of days

144
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,039
before the disaster.

145
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,559
Whatever it is they found in there,

146
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,053
they didn't want
nobody lookin' for it.

147
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:35,623
Of course that ain't gonna
stop us now, ain't it?

148
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,483
Watch this.

149
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,779
Nice.

150
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,113
Thanks, cowboy.

151
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,999
God dang it, I'm gonna
shoot the next person

152
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,469
that calls me cowboy.

153
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,759
I done told you, no
nicknames, butter knife.

154
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,410
Where are the others?

155
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,969
John's up at the lookout.

156
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,149
Stoker and the
priest are out and about

157
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,629
meetin' up with a contact
and gettin' somethin',

158
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,439
I don't know what.

159
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,863
But come on, I'll show ya the rest.

160
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,383
What's that?

161
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,849
This is all you, Reiko.

162
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,297
Stoker wants to see what's inside.

163
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,639
What do you think?

164
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,129
This is Soviet made, not
the usual American trash.

165
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,059
Which means it might take
me a while to open it.

166
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,793
I can blow it up.

167
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,659
Well, I like the
cut of your jib, little lady,

168
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,119
but this here ain't
no Barbie doll house.

169
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,297
Whatever's inside Stoker
wants in one piece.

170
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,863
Hey.

171
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,630
Aren't you on guard duty?

172
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,479
Look around.

173
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,649
Who is going to find us here, hm?

174
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,219
This here is dynamite
left over from the Soviets.

175
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,623
Check it out.

176
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,809
Well, that leaves you and me
with the equipment on the bus.

177
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,143
Come on.

178
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,793
By the way, who's the little one?

179
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,992
Laurie?

180
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:11,299
Mm.

181
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,699
I'll warn you,
mate, she's explosive.

182
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,033
Trust me, I have
no idea what I'm doing.

183
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,319
Now you listen up.

184
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,329
I don't care who
you are, or who you know,

185
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,319
or what you think
you know about me.

186
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,729
I'm not a little girl.

187
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,273
Who do I have to fuck to get
some respect around here?

188
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,303
I need some help.

189
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:11,510
Give me 15 minutes.

190
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,819
Oh man, fuck off.

191
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,083
Too bad you ran, man,
at Spiritu Santu.

192
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,446
Come on.

193
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,593
Ah, we were getting worried.

194
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,013
Meeting in five.

195
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,463
Hey, you look like you
could use a drink, amigo.

196
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:29,869
Too weak for me.

197
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,820
That's something for pussies.

198
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,589
Hey, may I?

199
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,290
I really could use some.

200
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,673
Thanks.

201
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:47,179
What is this?

202
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,425
Where the hell does
this shit come from?

203
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:54,663
Brewed in
Texas, just like me.

204
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,183
Say hello to your new
best friends, Komorov.

205
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,109
This man is our phantom.

206
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,439
I've been looking
for him for a long time

207
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,763
with no success till now.

208
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,849
Underneath us is
a vast tunnel system

209
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,729
built by the Nazis
during World War II.

210
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,739
What was its purpose?

211
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,989
A command center underground
in case of another war,

212
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,347
invisible to the skies.

213
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:50,849
All right, and what's that
go to do with this asshole?

214
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,229
This man knows these tunnels.

215
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,653
He's going to be our tour guide.

216
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,793
This man killed my father.

217
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,989
Where did you find this guy?

218
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,939
My friend, Sergei, he bumped
into him in the Ukraine.

219
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,183
I want to see his face.

220
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,933
Okay.

221
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,443
Wait.

222
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,040
He is Komorov.

223
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,837
You have no fuckin' idea
who this man is, do you?

224
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,649
We're in deep trouble.

225
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,329
Where you going?

226
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,739
Get my rifle.

227
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,079
Hey, Stoker, what the fuck?

228
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,879
What about it, Komorov?

229
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,493
We're in deep shit.

230
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,199
Yes.

231
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,533
Why is that?

232
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,996
Take cover!

233
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:00,764
Oh shit.

234
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,182
Holy shit.

235
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:39,419
What the hell's goin' on out there?

236
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,869
Everybody all right?

237
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,279
I'm fine.

238
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,112
I'm okay.

239
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,863
Still here.

240
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,499
What do you see?

241
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,100
More than two dozen.

242
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,953
Armed, masked.

243
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,673
They don't look military.

244
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,868
All right, everybody take
whatever you can carry.

245
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,648
Let's get the hell outta here.

246
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:13,220
You're with me, little lady.

247
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:15,079
Don't you want a weapon?

248
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,880
I got everything I need.

249
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:46,780
The name of the Father, the Son,

250
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,449
and the Holy Ghost.

251
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,412
Amen.

252
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,313
You really think this is
the right time for that?

253
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,420
Hell, didn't know
there was a wrong time.

254
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:21,480
My God.

255
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:59,319
Drop the gun.

256
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:59,043
There are more coming
in on the west end.

257
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,113
Cowboy, Laurie need support.

258
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,840
Copy that.

259
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,116
Hold your position.

260
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:15,400
Goodbye.

261
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,629
Shit, there are too many of them.

262
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,869
Stoker, nice of you to join us.

263
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,914
I just finished talkin'
to John on the radio.

264
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,999
Well, it sounds like
these guys are outta ammo.

265
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,250
There's only one way to find out.

266
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,473
Right behind ya.

267
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,273
Hey.

268
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,863
Don't mess with Texas.

269
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,732
And stay down.

270
00:34:57,698 --> 00:34:59,865
Cute.

271
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,703
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

272
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:38,656
We lose anyone?

273
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,740
John and Brenner.

274
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:47,050
Damn.

275
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:48,551
Good people.

276
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,929
We killed at least
30 of them, maybe more.

277
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,879
However, I count about 50
more on this side alone.

278
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,320
Holy shit.

279
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,883
Who are these guys?

280
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,089
All right, time to tell the truth.

281
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,290
I want to know why the fuck
people are dying out here.

282
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,900
What's this mission about, Stoker?

283
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,453
All right.

284
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,443
The Nazis were working
in one of these tunnels,

285
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,719
creating a secret weapon.

286
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,393
It was designed to help
Hitler win the war,

287
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,853
but fortunately he didn't
get a chance to use it.

288
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,593
This project was
called Atomic Eden.

289
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,223
The ultimate weapon
of mass destruction.

290
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,591
The power of God.

291
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:04,149
Doomsday device.

292
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,576
I mean, that's what we're
talkin' about, ain't it?

293
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,499
A motherfuckin' doomsday device?

294
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,223
Stay calm, soldier.

295
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,070
We believe the
Soviets found this weapon

296
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,573
and they created
a explosion on purpose.

297
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,069
It created a radioactive fallout.

298
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:27,570
The tunnels were blocked and
the area became uninhabitable.

299
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,560
Then why the fuck are we lookin' for it?

300
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,899
Things changed.

301
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,079
Since the disaster, radiation leakage

302
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,543
has minimized significantly.

303
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,709
Now, we can walk
through certain areas

304
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,179
for small amounts of time.

305
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,513
Komorov knew where the weapon was.

306
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,549
He was selling it to the highest bidder.

307
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,389
That's why we have to find this weapon.

308
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,299
Weapon can not fall
into the wrong hands.

309
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,683
Who's ever out there, they are after it.

310
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,269
What equipment do we have left?

311
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,149
Some weapons, but we are low on ammo.

312
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,299
There's the generator,
cable, and a few floodlights.

313
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,629
The rest is still in the car.

314
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,849
Still got that Soviet
dynamite in that old box.

315
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,899
Too dangerous.

316
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,459
The stuff is way too old.

317
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,889
Who knows if it's still reliable.

318
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,409
But I saw several chemicals
in the lab upstairs.

319
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,423
I could create something
similar to napalm.

320
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,329
Without enough ammunition
we won't stand a chance.

321
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,230
We can gather some
ammunition from the bodies.

322
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,079
Whoever they are, they
know our strengths now.

323
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,709
Maybe we should use that against them.

324
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,409
We secure the main
entrances by lighting them.

325
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,119
We have everything we need for that.

326
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,959
Nobody likes to sneak up when
an area is bright as day.

327
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,009
And if they take out the floodlights,

328
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,360
we'll know where they're coming from.

329
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,259
What about the main entryways?

330
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,809
I mean, hell, they could
get in through the windows.

331
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,489
We could secure the main entrances

332
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,453
with my explosive traps.

333
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,160
That should stop them for a while.

334
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,149
All right, people,
let's get on this now

335
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,389
before the sun sets.

336
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,359
Yeah, they could hit us
anytime from dusk till dawn.

337
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,949
Keep radio silence.

338
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,799
Let's move it.

339
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,420
David, would you gimme a hand?

340
00:41:44,575 --> 00:41:46,499
It's a woman.

341
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,883
Who are they?

342
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:31,269
What are we looking for?

343
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,199
I don't know, I don't know.

344
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,859
Anything that we can
find that help us find

345
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,060
the exact position of this weapon.

346
00:42:37,444 --> 00:42:38,589
I mean, I have one half of the map.

347
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,373
Komorov shows up, it's possible
he has found the other half.

348
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,693
A key.

349
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,160
I have a date with the vault.

350
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,733
Hey, Laurie.

351
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,773
I got one for ya.

352
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,700
Okay, what has 40 teeth
and holds back a monster?

353
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,013
My zipper.

354
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:29,693
All right, what the hell
do you know about funny?

355
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,580
Hey, will it work?

356
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:48,389
Bam.

357
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,599
The key fits.

358
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,583
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

359
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:04,229
How do we know this damn
thing is not gonna go kaboom?

360
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,429
It's a women's intuition.

361
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,473
If you are afraid, step back.

362
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,700
All we need now is the third part.

363
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,193
Well, maybe this is important.

364
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,587
Let's go join the group.

365
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:11,628
Son of a...

366
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:16,312
Okay.

367
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:30,533
You gonna help me with these
goddamn bodies or what?

368
00:47:36,307 --> 00:47:37,640
Yeah.

369
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,920
We're getting close,
Heinrich, I can feel it.

370
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,309
Be careful what you wish for.

371
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,643
I have.

372
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,480
What the hell,
you wanna live forever?

373
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,570
If it is God's will.

374
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,783
I pray for you.

375
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,633
I need that.

376
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,213
Find any ammo?

377
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,699
Just a few clips.

378
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,750
Most of their weapons were out.

379
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,913
They unloaded on us so they
could better detect us.

380
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,313
Goddamn death wish.

381
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,053
Who the fuck
are these guys anyway?

382
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:01,620
Maybe they
find peace in death

383
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:04,177
that they never found in life.

384
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,143
Amen.

385
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:09,899
Aw, hell, Jesus wouldn't
have said it like that.

386
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,400
All right, cowboy.

387
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,690
Why don't you show me
what Jesus would say.

388
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,083
He'd say, rest in peace.

389
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:26,455
It was a damn good fight.

390
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,306
And stop callin' me cowboy.

391
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,578
Touching.

392
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,403
Waiting sucks, huh?

393
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,553
Hang tight there, little lady.

394
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,063
Nothing's moved.

395
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,773
Why doesn't Stoker advance?

396
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,243
May I, cowboy?

397
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:44,653
Wow, that's definitely the best
moonshine I've ever tasted.

398
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,260
Not too strong, not too weak.

399
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,963
Just perfect.

400
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:52,083
Well, hell.

401
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,800
Might finally get
a use outta these.

402
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,479
Can I ask you somethin'?

403
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,093
If it's about my father, then no.

404
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,673
Sorry you didn't get
to kill Komorov yourself.

405
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,513
Thanks.

406
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,329
To us.

407
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,593
To life.

408
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:47,850
How bad is it?

409
00:56:48,332 --> 00:56:49,665
Deadly.

410
00:56:51,873 --> 00:56:54,456
Forgive me, Father, my...

411
00:57:00,802 --> 00:57:03,321
Goodbye, my friend.

412
00:57:03,322 --> 00:57:05,155
God go with you.

413
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,519
We can't keep
this up much longer.

414
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,099
We won't make it
through another attack.

415
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,463
She's right.

416
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,279
We are running
out of ammunition.

417
00:57:18,612 --> 00:57:20,100
We're running out of luck.

418
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,010
And we're running out of time.

419
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,673
Our Alamo.

420
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,399
It's time to go.

421
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,693
There's no shame in a
strategic retreat, sir.

422
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,003
To give them this
device is not an option.

423
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:48,189
It will cost too many lives.

424
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:51,019
Seems like an awful high price

425
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,053
for somethin' nobody wants.

426
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,930
You got something to say to me?

427
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,133
No, sir.

428
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:04,053
You know I follow orders and
lay down my life for you,

429
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,629
but this mission's been
desperate from the get go.

430
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:11,433
I'm all for tryin' to keep
this thing out of wrong hands.

431
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,519
All's I'm sayin' is, how do we know

432
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,773
who has the right hands?

433
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:57,833
Aw, shit.

434
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,929
Look, there's no
point in dying here.

435
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,509
Not now, not like this.

436
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,379
We'll get reinforcement,
new equipment.

437
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,129
We can come back.

438
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:14,949
If we leave, we come
back, it won't be here.

439
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:18,409
Then we will find them and
we will take it from them.

440
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,273
But now we have to get out of here.

441
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:26,419
Ethan, remember what
you promised my dad?

442
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,623
He wouldn't want us to die here.

443
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:32,441
It's not my plan to die here.

444
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:34,499
It wasn't my plan to
bring you here either.

445
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,719
You know you wouldn't
have been able to stop me.

446
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,020
Yeah, yeah, you're probably right.

447
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,559
All right, we can
escape through a tunnel

448
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,119
underneath the city.

449
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,619
Tunnel?

450
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,833
Why the hell didn't they use that?

451
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:51,579
I don't think they knew about it.

452
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,549
I saw it on Komorov's map.

453
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,659
If that's true, they have
nothing to do with Komorov,

454
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,839
which means they are here for us.

455
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,840
Son of a bitch.

456
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,223
They could follow us
through the tunnels.

457
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,699
Not if Laurie does her thing, right?

458
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,039
There's nothing in the
world I can't blow up,

459
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,083
but it's gonna take a while.

460
01:01:17,585 --> 01:01:20,003
This stuff is really unstable.

461
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,579
All right, I say we move out.

462
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,579
They're probably planning
another attack on us right now.

463
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,570
All right, move out.

464
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:58,973
Careful, this stuff
doesn't like friction.

465
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,999
Well, I like friction, don't you?

466
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,753
Sure, makes me explode, too.

467
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:11,453
Gonna have to remember that.

468
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,563
Little lady.

469
01:03:43,577 --> 01:03:45,409
So how does this thing work?

470
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,619
With adjusted time triggers.

471
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,659
They won't be too precise,
but they'll do their job.

472
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,869
We have 15 minutes.

473
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,499
And the tunnel?

474
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,499
I used my last bit
of napalm containers

475
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,109
and some wires for the entrances.

476
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,239
It's old school but it'll work.

477
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,789
Just be careful with
the wires, though.

478
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,979
When does the countdown start?

479
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,743
About two minutes ago.

480
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:10,167
Then let's get out of here.

481
01:04:12,612 --> 01:04:13,945
Sniper.

482
01:04:27,118 --> 01:04:29,868
I'm sorry I let you down.

483
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:35,972
Sir.

484
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:42,526
They will pay for this.

485
01:04:42,527 --> 01:04:44,027
They'll pay.

486
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:46,929
Sir!

487
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,680
We have to get out of here.

488
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:55,106
Let's go.

489
01:05:05,343 --> 01:05:07,843
Darwin, let's move it.

490
01:05:29,143 --> 01:05:31,393
Good luck, partner.

491
01:05:50,432 --> 01:05:52,349
Where's Darwin?

492
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:55,912
Didn't make it.

493
01:05:56,814 --> 01:05:58,147
Let's go.

494
01:06:12,483 --> 01:06:13,816
Attack!

495
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:45,723
Give me five minutes.

496
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,503
Fuckin' hero.

497
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:58,660
David, don't keep me waiting.

498
01:07:18,095 --> 01:07:21,095
Haven't I killed you before?

499
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:25,239
Where was that again?

500
01:07:26,217 --> 01:07:28,134
Espiritu Santo.

501
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:33,667
Yeah, you're right.

502
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:53,851
Shit.

503
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:02,563
Wait, we should wait for David.

504
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,389
I wouldn't worry about David.

505
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,340
He can take care of himself.

506
01:08:50,614 --> 01:08:53,947
Take care of your mother, honey.

507
01:09:34,665 --> 01:09:35,998
To me.

508
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,243
What is it?

509
01:09:53,217 --> 01:09:55,609
I don't know, I don't
know, something's wrong.

510
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:58,553
I remember from the map,
the tunnel stops here.

511
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,500
But that's not true.

512
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:02,799
It continues.

513
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,133
We have to go.

514
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,643
It's here.

515
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:51,691
It has to be.

516
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,083
How is there power down here?

517
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:20,945
When the Germans build something,

518
01:11:20,946 --> 01:11:22,863
they build it to last forever.

519
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,199
Mein Kampf?

520
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,413
I don't think so.

521
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,793
It's here.

522
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,187
I know it's here.

523
01:13:35,813 --> 01:13:37,806
He can still make it.

524
01:13:37,807 --> 01:13:40,017
Time's up, let's go.

525
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,519
Maybe the dynamite was too old.

526
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,079
No, no, trust me.

527
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,649
It's Laurie's way
of saying goodbye.

528
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:05,709
What?

529
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,486
Head down.

530
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:23,130
You da bomb, Laurie.

531
01:14:24,051 --> 01:14:25,601
You're the real bomb.

532
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:29,896
David.

533
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,169
So, that's why all
those people had to die?

534
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:14,389
For a Nazi secret
in an old suitcase?

535
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:18,149
They sacrificed their lives
for the future of mankind.

536
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,959
Then why do I have the feeling

537
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,369
this should have remained where
it was, lost and forgotten?

538
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:25,289
Sooner or later Komorov
would have found it,

539
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,439
or somebody like him.

540
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,415
That's why we had to secure it.

541
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:30,803
And what are
you gonna do with it now?

542
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,880
You guys waiting for me or what?

543
01:15:36,483 --> 01:15:38,566
And here you are.

544
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,250
One second, just hold on.

545
01:15:47,259 --> 01:15:49,284
Is this what I think it is?

546
01:15:49,285 --> 01:15:51,309
That's what we came here for.

547
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:52,499
You sure you won the fight?

548
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,650
You should see the other guy.

549
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:57,363
Yeah, right.

550
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,179
I hear traffic.

551
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,253
Home is that way.

552
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,203
Let's see.

553
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:42,299
The last time I saw you, you
were twice as big and black,

554
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,829
which means that
either the last mission

555
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:48,449
that you were on
completely changed you,

556
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,173
or you're not Stoker.

557
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,920
He couldn't make it.

558
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,203
Couldn't make it.

559
01:16:58,828 --> 01:17:00,161
Well.

560
01:17:01,889 --> 01:17:02,999
Ya see, I was really
hoping that you were

561
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,013
a white midget Stoker,
'cause we have a problem.

562
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,603
A big fucking problem.

563
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,359
You see, I had a date with Stoker

564
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,143
and you're telling me
that you're not Stoker,

565
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,467
and I really wanna
believe that you are.

566
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,153
So who the fuck are you?

567
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,429
Insurance.

568
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,373
Well, at least ya
did the right thing.

569
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,752
I hope so.

570
01:17:41,753 --> 01:17:43,880
A lot of good people died for it.

571
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,590
Do you have any idea what this is?

572
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:54,383
This is the beginning and
the end of everything.

573
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,389
This is what every man craves.

574
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:59,373
This is what every man fears.

575
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,233
This is the power of God, man.

576
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,693
This is Atomic Eden.

577
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,793
Stoker trusted you.

578
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,119
He found out who Komorov
was, didn't he, goddamn it?

579
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,309
Goddamn the fuckin' Russians!

580
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:36,289
You'd think after years
of espionage they'd know

581
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,573
how to fuckin' keep a secret.

582
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,683
So that's why Sergei is off the map.

583
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:54,529
Now it's all starting
to come together.

584
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,530
Stoker thinks he's got the
upper hand, doesn't he?

585
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,337
Maybe not, but it's the right hand.

586
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:06,653
Where the fuck do you
think you're goin', punk?

587
01:19:07,387 --> 01:19:10,229
Huh, you think this is a game?

588
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:11,969
Do you know how many
people are gonna die

589
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,813
to try to get that?

590
01:19:14,627 --> 01:19:17,659
Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

591
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:21,819
Atomic Eden is ours.

592
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,489
You're gonna tell me
where I can find it

593
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:25,223
and gonna tell me now.

594
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:29,577
You can't kill me, not
if you want to find Stoker.

595
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:36,915
You tell Stoker if
it's war that he wants,

596
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,553
it's war he's gonna get.

597
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:44,533
Greatest victory is that
which requires no battle.

598
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,519
Sun Tzu.

599
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,069
Yeah, I know, "The Art of War."

600
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:57,017
Fuck you!

601
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,283
Yeah, it didn't go so well.

602
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,413
I was stood up.

603
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,219
Don't worry, we'll find him.

604
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,520
I got the best chefs in the kitchen.

605
01:20:26,713 --> 01:20:28,046
Yes, sir.

606
01:20:32,295 --> 01:20:33,878
I understand.

607
01:20:40,943 --> 01:20:43,776
You're fuckin' mine, Stoker.

608
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,249
He won't stop until
he gets what he wants.

609
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,923
He's coming after you.

610
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,713
All right then, be prepared for war.
