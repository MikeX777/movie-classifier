1
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,768
There are a lot of handsome boys today

2
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,272
This one is really handsome

3
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,230
Come on

4
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,948
Are you blind? Should be more careful

5
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,874
There are many devil women on the beach

6
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,721
Come here

7
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,727
Give you a penny if you can catch me

8
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,629
Give me back my uniform

9
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,405
Come on

10
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,277
Don't

11
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,239
God damn you!

12
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,553
'Crazy woman chasing after the cop'

13
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,159
What an incident!

14
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,379
That police woman looks pretty nice
It's a pity that she wears glasses

15
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,391
You again!

16
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,324
Don't you think I'll not recongnize you
if you don't wear glasses

17
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,326
Good-day, Lady!

18
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,592
I beg you, please don't come
for further questioning

19
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,724
Every time you finish your questioning
we have to do first-aid for the criminals

20
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,702
I am just being loyal to the police force

21
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,461
Fine, I go to tell the doctor

22
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,799
Sex Maniac!

23
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,812
You go to hell

24
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,879
Son of bitch

25
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,544
That's not true, I have not even tried

26
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:43,911
Give it back to me

27
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,146
Let me try

28
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,751
Not bad!

29
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,495
You're not gonna get it back
if you don't say 'YEs'

30
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,784
I am not in mood, you'd better admit

31
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,809
Admit what?

32
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,856
Have roses got stings or not?
Yes, it has stings

33
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,757
Why all these laughs?

34
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,672
Too bad, it's you. Who is 'Seducer Wong'

35
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,590
Is it so funny to trap the'madam'?

36
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,064
Playing the role of a fool? Still again?

37
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,828
Jesus, I'm dying of laughing

38
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,900
What are you doing?

39
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,065
Injection

40
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,906
You are a nurse?
No

41
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,744
Doctor, she abuses me, I gonna sue her

42
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,907
Sue me? Have you got witnesses?

43
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,384
There are only two of us here. Are there
anybody else to witness against me?

44
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,444
You are murdering patient, are't you?

45
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,491
No, he laughed himself to death
I didn't even touch him

46
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:31,188
He laughed himself to death?

47
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,497
You saw it, tell him

48
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,104
Right, there are only two of us here

49
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,265
I said it's you who murder him

50
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,276
You are the murderer

51
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,379
Jesus! Got 'returns' now

52
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:28,782
Madam, this money note is mine

53
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,016
What evidence have you got that this is yours?

54
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,682
Did you see what kind of note it is?

55
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,654
Indian money note

56
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,532
This Indian money note is yours?

57
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,761
If you don't believe, you can smell it

58
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,070
Just the same smell as my pile of notes here

59
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,871
Just now when I went to
the toilet, I counted it

60
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,680
Beauty, want any? Give you two pieces

61
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,175
Fake

62
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:05,347
Rings are real. I want to make love with you

63
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,859
You go to hell

64
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,988
I love money but I never
make love with a watchman

65
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,500
Boss, your brief case

66
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,440
Going to cricket today?
Ya

67
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,670
Play hard! Let's get to the car

68
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,780
You said to give me rings

69
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,554
Now, no ring
You are too greedy

70
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:45,753
You are degrading the integrity
of our race, get moving

71
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,443
6080, come over here, got a seat here

72
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,619
I reserved a seat specially for you
Thanks

73
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,430
Our Father, who art in Heaven

74
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,624
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven

75
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,726
Give us this day, our dialy bread
Forgive us our trepasses: As we gorgive them

76
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:25,767
Who trepasses against us

77
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,068
Lord, lead us not into temptation.
But save us from devil. Amen

78
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,646
The killer comes here for dinner?

79
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,019
GOOD AFTERNOON SIR

80
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,359
I beg you. Don't do that again
The Lord will punish you

81
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,600
Our Father who are in heaven. Hallowed be thy name

82
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,371
Thy Kingkom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

83
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,812
Give us this day, our daily bread
Forgive us our trepasses as we forgive them

84
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,477
Who trepass against us
forgive us our trepasses Lord, lead us not into temptation...

85
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,076
What do you want?

86
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,288
Oh nothing, I just cover up your dish
so that they won't eat it

87
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,419
Pretending to be good

88
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,934
Someone's beating the cop
cop fighting against cop!

89
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,662
Help

90
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,678
More sideways! Please!

91
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:54,089
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it
No, Superintendent

92
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,521
No, killer sir

93
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,964
No Superintendent Wong

94
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:11,973
Although my hand has been hurt
I'm still working hard

95
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,005
Duty on street, dull as a cloud

96
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,975
You have to remain extremely alert

97
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,900
Trying to fool me by pretending to be as leep

98
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,666
Stand up for those who have fooled me

99
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,403
Stand up for those who have not fooled me

100
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:17,476
PC5198,PC5198

101
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,411
Now I am looking at you, I'm Mr Lau
Mr Lau

102
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,486
He I looked at me right in front of me. He
would have noticed if I opened my eyes wide

103
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,719
Can you see me?

104
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,825
Yes, I can. I'm looking at you too

105
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,091
PC5198, wipe the blackboard immediately

106
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,622
YES, SIR

107
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,257
Hurry up

108
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,634
There is no brush

109
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,175
The brush is in my hand
Thank you

110
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,643
Why doesn't this brush work?

111
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:11,324
Sorry

112
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,698
How come you are pinched all over by the crab pincers

113
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,671
Yes, here, and there too

114
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,113
Everybody has been pinched by him
But nobody dares make a noise

115
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,945
I made a complaintjust when he is at around

116
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,474
Come in

117
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,515
I have not complained you

118
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,381
Sir Cho
Take a seat please

119
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,924
Want some walnuts
Thank you

120
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,696
Do you know your nickname?

121
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,164
Crab-pincers

122
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,476
Somebody complaint that they are pinched
by you. Is that really true?

123
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,706
I hate one who treats others badly

124
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:10,144
Are you going to witness against her, PC6393

125
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,886
She alreadygestured 'No'

126
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,394
Do you like very much to pinch others?

127
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,128
Sometimes I do like to, butjust
pinched very gently

128
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,167
Full of love and care, incidental contact only

129
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:31,332
It should be described as gentle
touch rather than pinch

130
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,439
Good. I figure that you have
worked for me so many years

131
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,307
Forget it, 6393 doesn't rally sue you

132
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,752
Sir Cho, you are really a nice guy

133
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,120
O.K. Thank you

134
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,187
Darling, what brings you here?

135
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,398
Mrs Cho
Yes

136
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,767
Your son? So lovery

137
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,838
You...
So funny

138
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,033
Crab-pincers, you are really something

139
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:13,941
ATTENTION

140
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,015
GOOD MORNING, SIR

141
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,592
The result of the appeal are all here

142
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,454
And so are the seven of you

143
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,123
1,2,3,4,5,6. Only six?

144
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,156
Only six? Where is the other one?

145
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,649
I am sorry. My car broke down

146
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,549
I'm sorry

147
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,663
Get back to your seat gently
YES, SIR

148
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,991
Really smart

149
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,310
Good, got results. You wait to accept
the cruelty of fate

150
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,379
Everybody gets his share. This is yours

151
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,509
That is yours

152
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,724
Fired, too bad
Fired!

153
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,162
Ho Pik Sai, PC6017

154
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,524
It's lucky that it's not me
who is 6017?

155
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,857
Me

156
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,472
You're not lucky enough got fired, take it

157
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,909
Fatty, don't get happy too soon.
All seven letters are the same

158
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,213
Be calm

159
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,020
I think something uncommon will happen

160
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,950
Everybody knows, get out

161
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,245
ATTENTION

162
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,346
I think you all know me
Yes, we do

163
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,453
You are Inspector Tam. Who wouldn't know you

164
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,685
Chief Superintendent Tam

165
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,522
He is the typical gambling addict
throughout the police station

166
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,089
Sit down, please

167
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,870
The incident of all of you being fired
today is an arrangment of mine

168
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,839
Four bar-girls are separately murdered last month

169
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,779
The cause of death and places of
the four cases are different

170
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,012
Superficially, there seems no
connection among the cases

171
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,685
But personally, I feel they are
all done by the same person

172
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:11,427
The common factor for the 4 bar-girl is that
they all look cheap and wear very little

173
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,225
The commander orders to keep it confidential
and find out the murderer as soon as possible

174
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,999
I have even no time to play Mah-jon

175
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,635
If the murderer kills more club girls, then
it would make the case open to the public

176
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,436
The bar-girls wouldn't get
back to work, What then?

177
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,804
The wives wouldn't be afraid of husbands
fouling around in the night-clubs

178
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,848
Certainly they can turn to the call-girls.
No, to call the prostitutes

179
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,976
That is even worse

180
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:40,283
The night-life business will be affected
if the bar-girls wouldn't get to work

181
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,351
Then how can be still have
horse races and dances?

182
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,690
And how to maintain the stability
and prosperity of Hong Kong

183
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,991
The problem is really serious

184
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,636
I have already got an idea
for unweaving the case

185
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,669
I have made arrangements that
you are going to be a spy bar-girl

186
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:03,044
You are going to the most luxurious Crime
City Night Club to be a team of bar-girls

187
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,112
And your team number is 169
raise your hand one by one

188
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,782
Shut up! If you have any opinion,

189
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,523
Although everybody agrees that
I still have a good look

190
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,203
However, to be a bar-girl at my age...

191
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:31,966
Right, You are not going to be a bar-girl.
You're the mom of this team of girls. Next

192
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,440
Would it be possible if I don't do it?

193
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,476
I'm a Catholic. I'm afraid that
the lord would not forgive me

194
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,044
Is the Lord your boy-friend?

195
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:44,384
Call him to come to see me, sit down. Next

196
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,387
Why wouldn't you give us a little guidance on
how to be a bar-girl?

197
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,820
Don't worry, I prepared to teach you tonight

198
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,069
Who is it? Darling?

199
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,377
Soup again? I can't come home for dinner

200
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,611
I have some important thing to do

201
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,521
Three short of one, original cast
I'll come back immediately

202
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:24,559
This time, I must win back all my money

203
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:31,635
About your mission, talk less
and act smartly, that's all

204
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:37,173
Sir Tam, I don't know what a bar-girl is like

205
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,375
Sergeant, go back and read some further
reference, then teach them

206
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,434
OK, SIR

207
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,614
Yes, Sir Tam, we are all so beautiful
others would doubt

208
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,352
You average out with 6 ft3, then
nobody's gonna suspect anymore

209
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,251
Sir Tam, can we go to bed with customers?
Of course not

210
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,784
How about make love?
What's the difference?

211
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,496
To make love doesn't necessarily
have to be in bed

212
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,566
If there is no need to go
to bed, or to make love

213
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,062
But then the customer voluntarily
gives us money, can we accept it?

214
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,995
If you have this client, introduce me, please

215
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,500
Thank you sir. Thank you for picking me

216
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,504
Let me tell you the way I chose you

217
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,648
The night I chose you is just as tonight
I'm hurrying up to play Mah-jon

218
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,742
What has it got to do with out selection

219
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,150
Then what has Catholicism got to
do with being a bar-girl

220
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,386
You just treat what I said was crap
just that I have said nothing

221
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,156
Sir...

222
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,491
The case tonight is straightly confidential
Only eight of us in the world know this case

223
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,965
Absolutely no other people
should know, got it?

224
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,032
UNDERSTAND?
YES, SIR

225
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,435
Tonight, I must launch my revenge

226
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,034
I suppose we as the police force should catch
call-girl who knows we are becoming one now

227
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,838
What can i do?

228
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:21,907
Mum, it's all dynamite
You know, I'm treating you well

229
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,051
Get up, fattie

230
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,157
What's the matter, mum?

231
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,585
Are these magazines yours?
Those obsence magazines?

232
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,889
Gosh, you read these obsence magazines

233
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,425
What do you say?

234
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,627
You seemed like a law enforcer
while not being a chick

235
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,902
Not being a chick. It is stealing a chick
It's so simple: How come you don't know

236
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,310
What do you learn in school?
You are a good for nothing, Fattie

237
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,711
Bye, mum

238
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,783
Now we start our weekly self-study schedule

239
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,620
After my kid has gone to school
and before he is back

240
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,258
We must speak carefully. Let's use symbols

241
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,192
The project we received today
is 'Action of Hell'

242
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:24,970
We are 'Angels'. The killer's
named 'Melon Peeler'

243
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,478
We have to work hard to accomplish our task

244
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,474
OK, follow me to cry out a logan
ATTENTION

245
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:36,220
'Hell and Angels will win
Melon Peeler will finish'

246
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:41,692
'Hell and Angels will win
Melon Peeler will finish'

247
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:48,064
'Hell and Angels are the best
Melon Peeler will cry to death'

248
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,634
Now we start the first part of our training

249
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,298
Which is the information that I found out.
These are jargon og the club girl

250
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:01,035
Every night they speak to their clients
They always ask them like this

251
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,571
Listen, Mr. What is your names?

252
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,448
What is your name?

253
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,749
You've been here long?
You've been here long?

254
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,817
What's yourjob?
What's yourjob?

255
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:15,620
Where do you go for leisure?
Where do you go for leisure?

256
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,359
Don't talk in such a fierce manner be softer

257
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,060
Do you want to smoke? No?

258
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:28,872
Do you want to smoke? No?
I want a pack of Marlbore

259
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:37,177
I want a pack of Marlboro. OK?

260
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,540
Now it's time for practice

261
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:46,919
You want some honey melon? No?
Why haven't you shown up for such a long time?

262
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,589
Why not stick with other bitch?

263
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,704
Now I give each of you a background
I trust you've all learnt it by heart

264
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:06,109
PC3341, recite your part
YES, MADAM

265
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,113
I am'Chie Yin', no 8 group 169
of Crime City Club

266
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,307
I live in Lamma Island

267
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,713
My dad is a gambler and
my mother seduce another man

268
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,307
My elder brother has absconded
and my sister-in-law is pregnanted

269
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,012
We need money badly for theirs books

270
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,884
What aslo can I do other
than club girl? That's it

271
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,953
However, you speak in a policewoman's way.
It's a complete failure

272
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,420
I know you are being loyal
to the police force

273
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,526
Now is only the training, you
should dress like a club girl

274
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:31,991
YES, MADAM

275
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:42,008
You only care for sleeping. Go and
recite it for a thousand times

276
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,403
YES, MADAM

277
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:51,018
I'm a club girl named 'Chie Kuan'.
No 7 group 169 of 'Crime City Club'

278
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:51,817
She is my mother

279
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,518
Speak up
YES, MADAM

280
00:24:55,227 --> 00:25:00,995
I'm a bar girl named 'Chie Kuan'.
No7 group 169 of 'Crime City Club'

281
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,000
You are my mother, and I'm
your girl. I'm a club girl

282
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:08,634
I know you are a club girl
You fool, why don't you go on TV

283
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,341
You are quite without shame

284
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,701
Part four is dancing

285
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,802
6'3" come out and domostrate

286
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,902
It's OK. Go on with your dinner

287
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,467
I don't know the pattern of this dance

288
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,813
Tood bad, earthquake

289
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,316
God, what shall I do?

290
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,769
Believe in Jesus can get a bull?

291
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,598
Believe in fish can get a bull

292
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:22,413
My god. Believe in bull?

293
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:29,280
Sis, go get the BB glue fast
Stick it

294
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,258
What? You know nothing about dancing?

295
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,462
Who said it? There is a certain dance...
That I have won a prize for

296
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,093
Really?
Show us

297
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:53,535
Come worship our God

298
00:26:54,879 --> 00:27:04,151
Our mighty God. Holy Mother, your voice
of saint will always...

299
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,549
Take care of one

300
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,169
Lord, forgive me, hatred has
completely occupied my mind

301
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,699
Clergyman, those words are stuck
well. They'll never fall

302
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,868
Thanks

303
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,177
Believe in bull can get Jesus

304
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,784
The last lesson today is...
To practice wine drinking

305
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,986
You find yourself in a very disadvantageous
position if you get drunk very easily

306
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,587
So be ready to drink when I count 1,2,3

307
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,944
The devils come again

308
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,285
God, your kindness

309
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,900
You are too noisy upstairs

310
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,634
Jesus would be angry too

311
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,306
You got Jesus annoyed
Sorry: I think Jesus will gorgive me

312
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,243
If you don't go, you'll see Jesus very soon

313
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,654
Are you ready?

314
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,192
You all must not laugh if the truth pops out

315
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:28,323
I'm your protective angel. What do you wish?

316
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:37,833
Miracle! Lord, I have sinned
I gonna be a club girl after I have got drunk

317
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,577
Please help me be the hottest
and most beloved bar girl

318
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:47,980
And don't help those women cops in my team
Help them serve nobody

319
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,717
Fly, I goona fly to heaven

320
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,924
You're so insidious. Throw her stones

321
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,391
Hypocrite

322
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,107
Open the door

323
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,908
I come to warn you

324
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,751
I want to warn you

325
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,751
What are we accused of?

326
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,057
No. I mean I beg you

327
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,363
Do you wear underwear?

328
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,296
Why don't Clergy Ho come back yet?

329
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,970
Miracle, Jesus

330
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,940
No, I'm Clergy Ho

331
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,243
Clergy Ho

332
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,048
Don't worry. God will be with you

333
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:03,582
Why is he tied up?

334
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,095
God bless one who is tied up

335
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,631
You don't go to hell, who goes?
I don't go to hell

336
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,306
Forced to be a prostitute

337
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,479
What's your name, sir?

338
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,755
I'm from the Saint Church

339
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,821
What do you do?

340
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:35,823
I preach

341
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:41,655
Where can you find more fun?

342
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,933
We can't foul around everywhere
We usually foul around with ourselves

343
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:51,672
Just playing with oneself

344
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,307
Do you mind if I watch you with this stuff

345
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:02,117
No, that's OK

346
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,114
You watch carefully, I have
already phoned the police

347
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:14,090
We are not afraid of cops. We are cops

348
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:21,404
No, we are with the 169th team
of the Crime City Club

349
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,537
We are club girls

350
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,910
Oh, My God! It's crazy

351
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,215
Come follow me

352
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,423
This place is really big.
There is even a canteen

353
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,666
And even boutiques
Don't touch

354
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,916
Jesus, what if some of them recognize us

355
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,512
Calm down

356
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,917
Disgusting

357
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,427
Talk, say something

358
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,867
Dear Sisters

359
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:28,638
We are the newcomers, team no 169.
I'm their mamashan

360
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,304
Wendy Cheung also named as W.C.

361
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,375
Itjust doesn't seem alright.
Your name sounds so smelly

362
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:47,854
Miss WC, since you first come here.
I'll remind you of one thing

363
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:52,820
According to our rules here
all newcomers must...

364
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:53,761
Worship 'Kwan Gong'

365
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,958
'Kwan Gong', I know that god well

366
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,102
We worship together in the
police station very often

367
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,605
I mean when we are arrested
to the police station

368
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,840
I can read from your face

369
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,378
Let's worship

370
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,811
I'm Catholice, and I don't worship Chinese Gods

371
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,248
What are you afraid of?
Your God will condemn you?

372
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:22,114
Pray to him when you get back home, OK

373
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,090
You must stretch it over your head
to show your sincerety

374
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,294
Right?
Make wishes

375
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:39,001
'Kwan Gong', help our names sweep through
the whole of Tsim Sha Tsui East

376
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,146
Customers pour in well before seven

377
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,876
Customers bring us out even
before we get changed

378
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,010
Money, money and money each round the circle

379
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:54,351
Notjust supper but also money from the bed
And plenty of private pocket money

380
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,019
All things done and it's only 3 a.m.

381
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,028
Wish we could have comfortable bath
better than hearing your murmur

382
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,699
Bathe, and comfortably

383
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,042
Hurray
Hurray

384
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,704
Look, this one's trembling as in a cold

385
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,914
Maybe the omuth is blocked
and water flows over here

386
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,519
That's impossible. It that's true
water would have jetted down

387
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,454
It stuffed

388
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,193
Am I right?

389
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,801
Why isn't there anything jets out?

390
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,737
Waterfall

391
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,281
Why it takes so long for mamashan
to send for the client

392
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,819
We are the only two remains here

393
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,186
All other girls are out

394
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:09,566
Duck-beak-tart, a regular client has come.
Your wishes come true

395
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,324
Who?

396
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,335
There are altogether two only

397
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,698
'Crook-backed 7' & 'Lame-ming'

398
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,534
Don't stick around

399
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:25,443
I got to go to work. Can't be
as comfortable as others

400
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,180
God damn it. Even the leavings
are so arrogant

401
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:33,452
Though we are leavings, it's still better
than those good-for-nothing beast

402
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,254
Don't stir up troupble, get out

403
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:45,199
Mr, do me favour, calll my girls

404
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,432
Sir...

405
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,607
A real good-for-nothing beast

406
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,250
Nobody here doesn't know that I, Ko Tin Wai
like tall and musclar girls

407
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,150
All these girls don't suit me

408
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,916
Mamashans here are getting incapable.
Go get her fast

409
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,296
Hurry up
I'm sorry, Mr Ko

410
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,366
Sisters, everyone gets a table

411
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:24,402
Hurray Mamashan. Angel win all the way

412
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,476
Who got the nerve to swallow my table?

413
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,119
You are the Mamashan of team 169?

414
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,815
Calm down

415
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,582
You already know she is

416
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,193
I asked on purpose. Otherwise
where could I start from scolding her

417
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,489
You know who I am?

418
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:53,366
You are the most popular
Mamashan Queen Elizabeth?

419
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,194
Q. E

420
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:00,072
It's not I who want to take your tables
that short client requested

421
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,736
He asked you to swallow my tables

422
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,714
No, he asked for a very tall girl
and we've got one in our team

423
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,676
Which one is the tallest, let me have a look

424
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:21,225
She is really tall, my god! My hands shake

425
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,633
Don't get impetuous, sit down

426
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,563
THIS AN ORDER

427
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,470
King of groovy ha! So obedient

428
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,237
Stop laughing

429
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,913
THIS IS AN ORDER
Order!

430
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,419
What are you laughing at? Stop it

431
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,094
Everybody has limit for patience
Got any nerve to play with me

432
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:54,753
Villainous

433
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,393
Really something

434
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,271
Nothing here, better get to the tables

435
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,043
Go out

436
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,948
She asked for it
It wouldn't work if you don't play tough

437
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,557
Hurray! Mamashan

438
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,289
Just now, I'm so awe-inspiring

439
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,628
Just now you asked me to concede the tables.
Then you'll compensate for the hour

440
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,134
Since I don't know you will.
Better pay me now

441
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,433
Don't try to pretend. Pay it fast

442
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,702
What is even stronger than money

443
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,101
Pay her

444
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,246
Don't be so tough, we are sisters anyway

445
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,685
What? Don't keep your promise?
Take out the money or you'll try my fist

446
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,981
Bitch. You know who she is
She can arrest you

447
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,856
Accuse you of being prostitute
I'll pay

448
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,656
I'll pay. Lhave a card here.
I suppose that's alright

449
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,764
This is Miss Chi Ying

450
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,075
Not bad, the girl look nice

451
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,772
What's your name, honey?

452
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,516
I'm Mr Kim, Just come back from San Francisco

453
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,919
What do you do?
I mine gold

454
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,525
That's why your hands looks attractive

455
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,557
I suppose your hands worth
several 10 thousand back

456
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,559
That doesn't worth a mention

457
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,124
What are you doing?
I'm very nervous

458
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,092
Do chat with your man

459
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,169
What's your name, honey?

460
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,370
I'm Mr Cheung

461
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,236
Have you been around for long?
Yes

462
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,535
Smile

463
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,017
You've hang around for long?
What's your name, Mr Cheung?

464
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,649
Didn't mention it? I am Mr Cheung

465
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,746
Cheung. Your name is terrific

466
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,319
You are a new comer, aren't you?

467
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,520
That's right, I justjoined in

468
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,231
How do you become a club-girl?

469
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,134
Mr dad died very early and mom
ran away with another man

470
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,797
My little brother got cancer

471
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,332
And my little sister got
her legs broken by a car

472
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,610
And I support the whole family myself

473
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,915
How in human of you to laugh
at those sad stories

474
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,939
I noticed that you have not made
a sound for the whole night

475
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,166
Have you been observing are?

476
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:55,103
I have special talents with my eyes
and they can see in all dircetions

477
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,105
Now I'm watching your eyes
and I know all your secrets

478
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,042
Really? I don't believe you

479
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,717
You can try
Stare at my eyes

480
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,224
Is that guy watching me?

481
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,467
Miss, are you wearing a red
underwear with laces tonight

482
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,475
And there is a hole on the left

483
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,945
This is really terrible. I ran into a demon

484
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,776
Miss, easy. There is a cockroach
just about to attack you

485
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,483
I don't think so

486
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,497
No. That can't be true. It's on my shoe

487
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,294
Cockroach

488
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,507
Mamashan, come over here, fast

489
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,271
A suspected client wants to take me out

490
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,805
You have to go and induce him to kill you

491
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,611
Then you know if he is Melon Peeler

492
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:11,920
That's a good idea
However, can you do that for me?

493
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,949
I am too old to be killed

494
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,694
He's only interested in
young beauties like you

495
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,222
That sounds reasonable

496
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,332
Don't worry. If he killed you, I'd ask
Sir Tam to increase your salary

497
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,807
Who got the serve to play TV games
at this time of the night?

498
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,874
It's me

499
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,603
He comes for you

500
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,040
We'll talk in my room

501
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,578
Mamashan...

502
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,553
Any progress?

503
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,595
We did more outdoor service recently
but still no table service yet

504
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm not refering to that.
Forget your table services

505
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,828
I suppose you forget what you are here for

506
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,997
don't you know that three hours earlier

507
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,807
There was a club-girl killed
in a night in Mongkok

508
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,640
What do you think?

509
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:19,619
I suppose the murderer hasn't got much money
left. That is why he moves to a low class bar

510
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,050
I think you know what is shame

511
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,188
Let me tell you two things

512
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,960
Firstly, the murderer my have
all his front teeth missing

513
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:34,196
It is told from the teeth mark
on the club-girl last killed

514
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:35,996
Besides, probably he has lost an ear

515
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,739
Because we found the remains of an ear
inside the club-girl's stomach

516
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,703
It is almost digested

517
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,280
Anyway, we cannot be certain it
a pig's ear or an human ear

518
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,480
Then, it is very easy to identify someone
without front teeth and an ear

519
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:54,281
Now, you know what to do. I give you
two weeks' time to get the case done

520
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,058
Or else, I make you a club-girl
for the rest of your life

521
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,020
Sir, we have our promotion campaign next week

522
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:05,330
And we will elect the hottest one
I think the murderer will come to have fun

523
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,769
It will be great if he is coming
Well, I am not seeing you off: Goodbye

524
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:15,210
Just now I said you would be a club-girl
forever. I don't think it will be true

525
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,140
For your age, you will be a hawk
in Temple street soon

526
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,511
Got damn you. Dare you insult me

527
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:32,292
Meat ball, what makes you cry?

528
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,658
Has your client gone?
He has gone: Why?

529
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,762
Have you switch to work in a club?

530
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,160
How do you know?

531
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:47,168
Cause you have phone calls frome your clients
other clubs and your woman

532
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:48,839
How can I do not know

533
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:56,447
You know how heart breaking it was when
you were with the man inside the room

534
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,118
It's lucky that it's easily done

535
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,957
Meat ball, you misunderstood me

536
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,062
Mum, I won't look down upon you

537
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:10,565
I think you are great

538
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,460
I swear I'll turn over a new leaf

539
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,028
I'll never read obsene books
play girls, bunk, smoke

540
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,574
Never steal your money

541
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,702
You got many bad habits

542
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,108
From now no, I'll work hard

543
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,416
If I had known, I would have make it
straight that I'm a club-girl

544
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,548
I'll wok hard

545
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,461
Your client played TV games with me

546
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,363
He lost twenty-eight dollars without paying

547
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,262
Don't let him owe you money

548
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,533
I know how to do

549
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,303
Mother
Meat ball

550
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,477
Team 9, telephone

551
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,410
Cameraman, someone asks us to make a poster
We ignored them

552
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,848
You are too kind to us

553
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,749
Do you guarantee to put us on the front page

554
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:06,945
Of course

555
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:13,089
We have our principles, we won't make any nude photos

556
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:17,367
No. We never ask people to put off
everything to shoot photos

557
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,568
At least put on a pair of stockings
or a watch

558
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:22,764
It's better

559
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,134
Let us think of that first

560
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,550
You are in a club deceiving girls again

561
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,613
Sister, I'll be fired without
photos to produce

562
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,123
I understand now, mum said you made
her drunk last time

563
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,921
What did you take last time

564
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,790
If i am not that bad, I won't ask
that worst girls to make photos

565
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:54,903
You insult us, We don't let you take photos
Go back to take your mum's photos: Bastard

566
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:02,302
It's really hard to make a living
in the cultural field

567
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,438
That's why I lost four teeth

568
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,210
What is this?

569
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,945
He is Ah Kai. The only model with our magazine

570
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:18,283
Please introduce a beauty
to take a photo with Ah Kai

571
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,920
You only come to me when you have problems

572
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:25,495
You figure which one of these club-girl
would not get along well with you?

573
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,398
How about team 169

574
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,704
In the Hottest Team Contest Night

575
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:34,437
I already said there must be one
Sister got a lot of enemies outside: Besides, she is insidious

576
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:35,443
What did you say?

577
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:39,505
Nothing
I'm talky, I deserve a slap

578
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:43,847
Mamashan Q.E., telephone

579
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:50,185
Stick up your forehead
and let me see you brows

580
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:55,323
Your brows are sharp and slender, just like
the new moon hanging up on the trees

581
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,458
You just whisper to Uncle Ho's hearing aid

582
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,059
We can't hear
That's the way I like it

583
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:06,108
Your brows are sharp and slender, just like
the new moon hanging up on the trees

584
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:11,677
Your eyes are clear and bright
just like waves in the sea

585
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,080
Lovely songs

586
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:19,554
Chi Ling, you are so cute
You are lovely too

587
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,394
Uncle Ho, our company is launching
a promotion next Sunday

588
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,295
We need your support
Sure

589
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:34,362
Uncle Ho, would you like some bean curds.
Be sure not to choke yourself

590
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:37,905
You're left-handed?

591
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:49,249
Mamashan, you know I am materialistic

592
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:53,522
You grabbed Uncle Ho from the hands of
Big Sister. You're really something

593
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,054
It also means saving our teams' face

594
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,492
But you must not forget that we are angels

595
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,125
Q.E., they have supper with Uncle Ho in there

596
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:13,674
Uncle Ho, we do need your support from now on

597
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,876
You bitch. You grabbed my customers

598
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,477
What do you want?

599
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:25,452
How about taking all out for supper?

600
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,720
It would be even better with more beauties

601
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:37,827
It's almost twelve. Tomorrow
is my 80 in birthday

602
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,971

I'm just proposing a toast. I wish

Coffins open their lid when they see you

617
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,510
What did you say?

618
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,487
Uncle Ho, she said you are close to death

619
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,185
I didn't. She lied

620
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,556
No, I didn't
She did say so

621
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:38,651
No

622
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,300
TESTING, TESTING

623
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,679
1, 2, 3, Uncle Ho, Can you hear?

624
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:59,742
It's all your fault, isn't it?

625
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:03,778
It's all yours
Snaky woman

626
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,046

It make me angry when I can't hear
what others say in front of me

00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,131
She is a bitch
Snaky woman

632
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:27,507

What? I didn't hear

635
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,755
She is a snaky woman

636
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,028
She is...

637
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,394
A snaky...

638
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,406
A dish

639
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,853
Snaky

640
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,423

00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,145
Nice smell

646
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,014
Nose

647
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:47,912
Smell

648
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,150
Sniff

649
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,490
I don't know how you make it. Stupid fool

650
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:01,168
Me foolish, I have shown all
on my facial expression

651
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:06,503
You bastard. You can't get it
You better go to hell

00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,530
Our friends, welcome to the 'Crime City Club'

00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,400
As you all know, the three
hottest groups of ladies

A return ticket to Ethiopia with meals
and hotel inclusive

663
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,246
Mamashan, I have a feeling that
we will be the worse one

664
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:58,922
What should we afraid of. The worst is
the worst still, we are the angels

665
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,266
I have a feeling that Melon Peeler
will show up tonight

666
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:09,271
Listen, we have to be very alert

667
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:13,269
Melon Peeler is characterised by having
four front teeth and an ear missing

668
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,804
Let's go
Yes

669
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,266
Why did you take pictures?

670
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:52,637
My sister Q.E. Ask me to take photos here

671
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,774
You drink both red and white wine. No wonder
your have one ear red and one ear white

672
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,545
You face is red and white too.
Just like a monkeys bum

673
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,281
You two drink white wine and have red shit

674
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,957
Ladies and gentlemen, I just got
the preliminary result at hand

675
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,565
Up till now, the leading team is team1

676
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:18,230
Why don't we have a few words from
the Mamashan of team 1, Q.E.

677
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,906
Q.E. Please

678
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:31,076
Thank you for your support
I'm to glad that our team is leading

679
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:37,222
Don't you mistake it as
the Miss Hong Kong Pageant?

680
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,756
I want to cry

681
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:45,933
My heart is broken

682
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,999
As there are 238 teams of
Ladies in our company

683
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:54,072
But one of the teams is really discouraging

684
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,737
They are the no. 169

685
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,669
That's us

686
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,084
And it is no.169

687
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:08,349
That is the mamashan of the team.
They only got 82

688
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,685
470 polls behind the second last

689
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:22,969
What a pity

690
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,504
As Shakespeare said 'being a
woman is a dull business'

691
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,513
Awoman with out a man is
no better than garbage

692
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,118
Come out, better come out quick. You bitches

693
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,619
Listen girls of 169

694
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,465
The mission tonight is to pull polls

695
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,295
Just now, you said the contest
is rubbish, is nothing

696
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:53,997
Maybe it is. But one's face is more important

697
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,399
But Melon Peeler would be here any minute

698
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,203
He can't get out of our hands anyway. But
in two hours, all the polls would have gone

699
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,264
Get going

700
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,104
Go to get polls

701
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,246
Could I speak to Uncle Ho, please?
He isn't in?

702
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,182
What? Gone to Lye-yuen Villa?

703
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:17,019
No, the Kowloon Hospital. Thanks

704
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,624
You have a lot of restaurants?
Come to my restaurant after we fininhed

705
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:27,560
Do you know I love you so?
Don't you know our relationship?

706
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,874
Boss, I'll go over at onece. Please sit

707
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,274
Suit yourself, want a drink?

708
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,282
Beer?
Beer...

709
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:52,327
It must be XO
OK? OK

710
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,453
It's fortunate that I'm smart

711
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:59,465
It's always you get in my way
Don't I ever see you again

712
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,103
Why did you take my picture?

713
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:14,143
You look sexy
I lose control and the button clicked

714
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,306
Really?

715
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,821
I've made a lot of exciting photos

716
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,880
OK

717
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,486
Finish

718
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,067
Everybody, I got a good news!

719
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,694
In response to the stimulation of mamahan from team 1

720
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,535
After working hard

721
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:43,439
Team 169 has gained 246 more polls

722
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,772
The rate of increase is incompatible

723
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,788
It's getting closer and closer to second last

724
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,221
Only a different of 362 polls

725
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,392
Mamashan. We gonna lose

726
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,254
Why don't we sneak out before
they announce the results?

727
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,322
Sneak out? That's what a coward would do

728
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,298
Hurry
Hurry

729
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,070
You gonna try my fist before you get through

730
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:16,141
Q.E. Knows you will run away
That's right

731
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:21,474
We come to get you on to the stage
Ya

732
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,547
Let's break through
Run

733
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:29,248
No. None's gonna get free.
How dare you beat me

734
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,954
Uncle Ho
Uncle Ho

735
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,488
Uncle Ho
You are so kind

736
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,394
Gentlemen, it's only half
a minute to the deadline

737
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:46,939
Hope you take your time for the last attack

738
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:51,436
However, personally, I advise mamashan of
team 1 be ready to come on to the stage

739
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:56,917
Because up till now, she leads
all the way by 3, 100 polls

740
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,656
Mamashan Q.E., please

741
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,183
Mamashan Q.E. Must win

742
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:07,594
QE, QE, QE...

743
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,588
Now, what about on 15 seconds countdown?

744
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:16,764
Ready, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10...

745
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:20,468
Wait a minute
Hurry

746
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,141
Uncle Ho, have you get money for our polls?

747
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,346
What did you say? I can't hear

748
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,686
Now I demand complete silence
THIS IS AN ORDER

749
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,493
Uncle Ho, have you got money for our polls?

750
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,858
Ya, but not much

751
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:46,959
I'm sorry, I have to resume the count down

752
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:52,133
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...

753
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,037
Wait!

754
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,972
Probably enough for 3000 polls

755
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,144
Uncle Ho, fixed 3000 for us

756
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:12,287
Congratulations. Shall we have a few words
from mamashan of team 169

757
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:22,034
Thank you

758
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,566
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

759
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:29,270
I'm so glad tonight. I feel a little
uneasy for mamashan from team 1

760
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:37,585
Shakespeare has written 'lt is honourable
for the last one to get to top'

761
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:42,556
He also said 'lt's hard to go off
the stage with a dummy prize'

762
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,523
Thank you

763
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:10,046
Shup up! Stop barking
Be good! Don't be impolite

764
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:15,055
Let me introduce to you
Miss Chi Mei of the 'Crime City' Is she pretty?

765
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,951
You must be hungry. Let me
treat you a big dinner

766
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,724
Take the bag, please

767
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,300
Easy. We are going

768
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:36,004
Your places is really queer

769
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:42,240
This is my studio too

770
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:46,481
I did my photos here and my dissection too

771
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,189
Would they let you do that?

772
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,056
It's not up to them, anyway

773
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:31,863
These girls looks familliar

774
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,864
I remember, they are the victims
of a certain murder

775
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:41,366
What a concidence. You've made
photos for them before

776
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:46,645
Good. You got photos of them
at the time of murder

777
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,718
How can you get it, honey?

778
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:55,583
Right, the murderer has one hand
4 teeth lacking

779
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:06,127
Listen, I tell you now why I want to kill you

780
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:11,136
Because you look just like my wife

781
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,071
Rotten and degrading

782
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,004
That guy of bitch of hers knocked my teeth out

783
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,973
Doesn't they worth the killing?
Yes, it does

784
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,106
Isn't thta rotten?

785
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:25,381
I'm rottenl. From this moment, I will change
I can be a fair lady

786
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:32,218
Can you? Then show me

787
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:35,386

788
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,401
Sit
Sit

789
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,261
Stand up

790
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:49,808
So like
Sleep

791
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:56,675
I will never let a man watch me sleep. Never
Don't touch me

792
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,014
Do I look like a lady?

793
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:07,121
Yes, you do, very much like my wife.
Like a lady outside, but you are rotten inside

794
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,330
You'd better get start. Don't waste time

795
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:16,638
After you died, I still
have a lot to finish up

796
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:21,674
After the photographs, I gonna kill you
Then I'll clean up and dump your corpse

797
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,472
I am afraid I won't have much sleep tonight

798
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:26,974
Tomorrow at seven, I have an appointment
with Margaret Cheung

799
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,181
I beg you

800
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:43,126
We now shoot the bustful scenes, wilder
Got to be real

801
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,258
CAMERA

802
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:06,217
She's changed. Don't waste your effort
It won't be help even you get in

803
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:13,851
It's all over

804
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:23,631

Please do me a favour pursuade Chi Mei

807
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,979
I do love her

808
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,117
I am afraid she's deceived by that reporter

809
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:47,553
I followed them to the house.
They made love in there

810
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,326
God damn you. Still thinking of girls
even when you don't have a penny

811
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,360
I'm glad for Chi Mei

812
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,893
She finally realize the importance of money
That's right

813
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,467
Bloody hell, drink it, want me to shit you

814
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:02,070
Alright, I'll drink it

815
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,510
Look at Chi Yin, she's all red

816
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:12,513
Just opposite for 'Fattie Pig'
always been white

817
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:18,520
That camera man is even stranger.
One ear red and one white when drunken

818
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,755
Isn't it?

819
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,653
Maybe one of the ears is fake

820
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,356
'Melon Peeler'

821
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:25,856

Your legs are nice

827
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,731

01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:17,450
Winter is coming
I'll eat your legs

830
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:22,156
It is time to kill you

831
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:28,793
I blow you with an axe

832
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:35,095
You must bear the pain

833
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,962
Don't make here dirty

834
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:44,575

Somebody is coming

838
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,139
Catch him, he is in his spur of emotion

839
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,191
Get lost, I want to kill you bastards

840
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,152

842
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,548

'Melon Peeler' has come

851
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:36,783
What's that?

852
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,758
It's pertrol, he wants to burn us to death

853
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:44,626
Oh God, I'm a little bit sinful though
it is not necessary to burn us to death

854
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,999
First part take one 'Chick Fillet Cubac'

855
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:52,703
Lit the fire. No lighter

856
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,105
Lit up the fire. No lighter

W.C., where are you? Come out if
you have guts. I'll beat you up

858
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,285
Q.E. Come on if you have guts

859
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,584
What? I dare not come in to beat you up?

860

I tell you something, sister
You must not go into spoil the whole thing

861

But why? You bastard, you are
always on the others side

862
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,198
Sister, it is not the case

863
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:23,101
What? Ambulance chasing. You will
only shoot a film for the winner

864
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,896
I'm very angry

865
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:30,139
No smoking, miss
None of your business

Government warning:
Smoking is hazardous to health

870
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,816
What are you doing?
Q: E:, you have no guts to come in?

871
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,858
No guts? You silly bitch

872
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,627
Uncle dog, Aunt dog, watch out
somebody is attacking you

873
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,964
Help

874
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,303
Siu Wan, Siu Kit, don't do this to me

875
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:01,536
Siu Wan, Siu Kit, no, I'm your sister

876
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:02,504
Beat her up

877
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:05,308
Silly bitch. You want to run away.
Help me chop her into pleces

878
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:07,805
Ah Shing, go away, it's not your business

879
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:10,449
He is hired. Move

880
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,004

Step...

885
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,933
Pincers

886
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:08,371
Elbow
Knee

887
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,377

01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,146

890
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,210
Damn

891
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,380
Are you crazy?

892
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,493
Don't come over. I don't want a fight

893
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,925
I like it

894
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,703
The first blood. Father, the son
and the holy gods, and go

895
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:46,939
The first blood of girls are dear

896
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:51,882
I have to avenge

897
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,884
God says 'Love your enemy'

898
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,788
I love my enemy is dead

899
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:04,865
I killed her

900
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:12,063
Why does the hole disappear?

901
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:13,768
Where is the hole?

902
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:19,646
Gold chain. I'll be rich

903
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:23,843
Gold, gonna beat you up

904
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,614
You trapped me. You made me

905
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,123
Go, move it

906
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:43,464
Help

907
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,277
Sister, are you OK?

908
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,507
Ya, I'm fine

909
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,752
Sister, what's wrong?

910
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:09,689
Get lost, bitch

911
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,663
Don't get my closer or I'll chop him up

912
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,511
Go to hell
Miraculous strength

913
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,516
Master spirit came

914
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,280
Anything can't go through

915
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,858
All passed
The axe is real

916
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:43,524
I'm painful

917
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,401
We got a way out
We can saw the rods part and jump

918
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,264
Open the door

919
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:08,912
You can't go away

920
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,726
Just like in a sauna, bitch

921
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,736
Cheers
Cheers

922
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,275
Guess whether Sir Tam has heard about it?

923
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:37,317
He would have learnt from
the news early this morning

924
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,821
This looks like mom's client

925
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,588
Mom, you got a client on TV

926
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,193
Do I? Let me see

927
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:49,760
Deputy Police Commissioner Mr Tam Tai Tok
Last night in his friend's home

928
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:56,127
He lost much in Mah-jon game
Thus, heart attach immediately

929
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:59,469
Died on the way to hospital
Age 46

930
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:03,908
Mah-jon Trade Union shall hold
the funeral ceremony tomorrow

931
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,846
Each and every of you looks

932
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,912
Upon this whole world only 8
of us know all about the plan

933
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:17,190
Nobody would know if he died?

934
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,353
Don't press me.

935
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,690
I have studied what you said

936
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:31,637
There seems so evidence of you being a
'Cover Up as a Club-girl'

937
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:35,800
What the hell is all about?

938
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:40,637
SIR

939
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,320
They found this order in the
files of Superintendent Tam

940
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,520
It has your names written

941
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:59,759
You are too lucky
This seems the ony evidence supporting you

942
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,035
It's alright then
Shut up

943
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,933
What are you doing?
What's the meaning?

944
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:08,407
What do you want?

945
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,444
Now then, there wouldn't be any evidence

946
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:12,673
Don't worry, it can't be

947
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:15,476
I know he's kidding.
He already got a photocopy

948
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:17,879
No. I'm sorry

949
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:21,344
You...

950
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,485
Look for yourselves

951
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,085
What is this?
What is this?

952
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,022
You were elected 'The hottest girls'

953
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,897
It's all published on news. How can
we have you in our force again?

954
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:36,904
I'm just protecting the name of
the Rayol Hongkong Police Force

955
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:38,900
What can we do then?

956
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,532
Get back to where you belong

957
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,570
Great
Objection

958
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,710
No, I can't, what would my son say?

959
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,176
Why are you so sad?

960
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:57,481
You can all make bucks, poor me. I only got a
thousand or two. How can I survive on that
