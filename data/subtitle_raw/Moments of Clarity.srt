1
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,140
(winding)
(metallic tapping)

2
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,770
(slow music)

3
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,314
(light music)

4
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,176
(ding!)

5
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,679
(music)

6
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,534
(whinnying)

7
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,708
(ding!)

8
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,210
(music fading)

9
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,121
- Hands above the covers!
- Oh!

10
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,460
- Was I...? It wasn't you.
It was the dreaming you.

11
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,094
Keep your "yous" separate

12
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,729
and you'll never have anything
to apologize for, possum.

13
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,798
So what shall we girls
tackle today?

14
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,296
- I wanna make muffins.

15
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,869
- Well, wash up and we'll see.

16
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,742
- Oh!

17
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,877
(sighing in contentment)

18
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,747
(soft music)

19
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,426
(birdsong)

20
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,660
(soft music)

21
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:52,111
Oh... We don't have any vanilla,
do we?

22
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,612
- No. Make them without.

23
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,505
- Uh... but...

24
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,777
the book says we need it.

25
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,216
They won't turn out
the way they're supposed to.

26
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,752
- Most things in life don't turn
out the way they're supposed to.

27
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,718
In fact, that will be today's
lesson:

28
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,588
Anticipointment.

29
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,827
- Oh! Fun!

30
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:15,302
- When we expect too much
out of life,

31
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,733
we get smacked
by disappointment.

32
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,228
- Oh.

33
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,470
- Words to live by.

34
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,309
(soft music)

35
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,493
(ding!)

36
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,233
(sighing)

37
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:50,755
Why can't you leave them at
the back of the church on Sunday

38
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,071
and people can grab them
when they leave?

39
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,243
- Because they're warm now.

40
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:58,073
People have been so kind to us.

41
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,708
It's time we repay them.

42
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,244
- But so many of them haven't.

43
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,781
- But so many of them have.

44
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,676
I won't be long.

45
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,853
I won't be long.

46
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,424
- Fine.

47
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,390
But head down at all times,

48
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,989
and whatever words
come out of their mouths

49
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,931
are not to be listened to.

50
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,866
- Yes, Mum.

51
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,602
I'm 24.

52
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,597
- Well, if you want to see 25,

53
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,269
you'll come back as soon
as they snatch that last muffin.

54
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,940
(young woman sighing)
- Deal.

55
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,878
There and back.

56
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,548
Mwah!

57
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:42,378
(giggling)

58
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,404
(winding)

59
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,103
(ticking)

60
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,968
(soft music)

61
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,966
(birdsong)

62
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,408
(light, upbeat music)

63
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,005
- Oh, Claire!
What a treat seeing you.

64
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,008
I'm surprised you're out.

65
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,920
- I couldn't keep these
to myself.

66
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,921
- Oh.

67
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,016
They smell amazing!

68
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,018
Thank you, Claire.

69
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,690
- Anytime!

70
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,029
- Oh, so she's okay,
your mother?

71
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,764
- Better than ever.

72
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,170
- Oh, she's very lucky
to have you, you know.

73
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,843
- I'd do anything for her.

74
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,542
- I wish my children were here
to take care of me.

75
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,436
Too busy complicating
their own lives

76
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,809
to realize where they're needed.

77
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:22,278
When my husband died,
I was at his bedside,

78
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,219
holding a picture
of our children.

79
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,755
Oh, well,
she's just lucky, is all.

80
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,221
Thank you for the muffin,
Claire.

81
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,430
- My pleasure!
- Oh!

82
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,128
Have a great day.

83
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,796
- You, too.

84
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,795
(giggling)
- Off I go!

85
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,838
(chuckling)

86
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,411
- Yes?
- Hi.

87
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,650
Are your parents home?

88
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,545
(woman): Who is it, baby?

89
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,047
- It's that girl
from down the street.

90
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,249
- Shhh.
Stay quiet and she'll leave.

91
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,961
- I don't like her.
How could you? She's crazy.

92
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,685
Now shhh.

93
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,603
- Mom?
(muffled screaming)

94
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,796
(crying)
- Stay off my damn porch!!

95
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,768
(brakes screeching)
(exclaiming)

96
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,041
- Stay home, freak show!
(Claire crying)

97
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,056
- Are you okay?

98
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,628
Oh, my... give me your arm.

99
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,304
- Oh...
(grunting)

100
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,202
Oh...

101
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,904
- Come on, let's get you inside.

102
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,310
- Hey...

103
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,648
it's 14108 Pinewood.

104
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:04,284
- Well, yeah.
- I have a muffin for here.

105
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,221
- I'm sure you do.

106
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,860
Oh, crap.

107
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,392
Here.

108
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:14,361
Hold your nose like this.
- Oh.

109
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,657
- Go sit inside.
- Okay.

110
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:25,111
- Well, it looks like you've got
everything under control here.

111
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,039
- Who's that?

112
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,938
She's gorgeous.

113
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,410
- No one.

114
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,621
You should still
probably ice that.

115
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,045
- Okay. May I see your room?

116
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,161
- Uh... I guess.

117
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,893
Just don't bleed on shit.
- I have a tampon up my nose.

118
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,600
- Yeah, I can see that.

119
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,133
(funky music)
(woman moaning)

120
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,530
(moaning)

121
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,372
Oh...

122
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,636
Churn me like butter.

123
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:03,076
You're my favourite cousin!

124
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,713
Ah!! Ah!!

125
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,919
(exclaiming)

126
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,093
- Wow!

127
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,152
I love this.

128
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,185
I'm only allowed
to put up things that I create.

129
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:21,798
- That's cool.
That's really cool.

130
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,702
- I want a map like that.

131
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,235
Have you been
to all those places?

132
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,469
- My uncle's been
to all the pins that are red.

133
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,310
All the blue pins are the places
I'm gonna get to someday.

134
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,252
- Do you have anymore ice?

135
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,187
- Yeah, sure, one second.

136
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,599
(door opening)
(man): I'm home!

137
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,266
- In the kitchen.
I have someone over.

138
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,674
- Oh?

139
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,267
Oh, it's you. Hello, Claire.

140
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,509
- Hello, Pastor Paul.

141
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,275
- You... you okay there?

142
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,779
- Oh, I... I ran into a tree.

143
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,277
- Well, I hope
you taught it a lesson.

144
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,349
(laughing)

145
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,961
You know, Claire, your mom's
probably worried sick.

146
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,494
Let me drive you home.
- That would be swell.

147
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,029
- Danielle, I'm gonna
give your friend a ride home!

148
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,967
You wanna come with?!
- Nah.

149
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,302
- We can stop and get
some chicken on the way home!

150
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,638
- No, Paul.
- Oh...

151
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,065
(chuckling)
Let's go Claire.

152
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,080
- Okay. Ah...

153
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,649
What's your favourite bird?

154
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,916
- My favourite bird?
I've, uh...

155
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,986
...never really given it
much thought.

156
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,185
(chuckling)
Ugh, pigeon.

157
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,987
No.

158
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,389
Seagull.

159
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,930
- Why?

160
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,525
- I don't know. You?

161
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,865
- I don't have one.
Birds scare me.

162
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,966
- Birds scare your mom, Claire.

163
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,584
Listen, um...

164
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,883
Okay - ahem - how would you...

165
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:23,346
like to represent the parish
at the annual...

166
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,886
Pump Up the Jamboree
Youth Ministry Conference?

167
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,592
- Why me?
= Because you'd be perfect.

168
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,688
And - ahem - it would be a sin

169
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,502
to turn something like this
down.

170
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,434
- Oh, wow.

171
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,635
I... I... couldn't.

172
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,874
- Yes, you could. And you will.

173
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,340
Even if your mother
doesn't agree.

174
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,839
- Can she come?

175
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,451
- No, Claire, she can't.

176
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,723
- Oh.

177
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,023
Will you be there?

178
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,886
- Definitely.
- Then yes.

179
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,455
Yes, I'm going to come.

180
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,985
- Excellent.

181
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,160
Well, then it's settled.

182
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,470
You still live
at your grandparents' house?

183
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,702
- It's ours now.
- Oh?

184
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,939
- They signed everything over.

185
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:22,236
- You ever go visit them?
- It's too far.

186
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,049
- Fifty miles is not far,
Claire.

187
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,752
- That's a world away.

188
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,875
- Well...

189
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,950
here... we... are.

190
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,355
- Thank you, Pastor Paul.

191
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,658
- You're welcome, Claire.
And, um...

192
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,029
would you do me a favour?
Would you...

193
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,868
say hello to your mom for me?

194
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,795
- I always do.
- Thanks.

195
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,374
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

196
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,078
(knocking)
Jesus Christ!

197
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,917
Yes?

198
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,516
- I forgot to offer you
my muffin.

199
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,258
I made it nice and moist
for you.

200
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,494
I even got
the neighbour's zucchini in it.

201
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,595
- Thank you, Claire. That's...

202
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,904
Thank you.

203
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,941
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,673
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Oh, uh, Claire?

205
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,139
I think, uh, the bleeding has...

206
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,639
stopped.

207
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,180
- Thanks.

208
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,506
Bye-bye.

209
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,421
- Bye-bye.

210
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,417
(soft music)

211
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,837
(sniffling)

212
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,843
(soft music)

213
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:59,665
(sighing)

214
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,569
(sniffling)

215
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,852
(sniffling)

216
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,297
- Oh...

217
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,337
Oh! They loved them!

218
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,313
They loved them!

219
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,984
(soft music)

220
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,749
Oh! Hey!!
(honking)

221
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,661
(screaming)
(gasping)

222
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,564
- No! No!!

223
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,856
No! Look what you did,
you idiot!

224
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,399
- Uh, is it okay?

225
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,765
- No, it's not okay! You're
gonna have to replace this!

226
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,005
It's a fucking vintage camera!

227
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,671
- I have glue.

228
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,681
- Go. Just go!

229
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,613
- Uh...

230
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,108
I feel bad.

231
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,480
- You should.
- Well, I... I do.

232
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,120
- Good.

233
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,385
- It was a mistake.

234
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,724
- Just like you!

235
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,391
(crying)

236
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,026
(sobbing)

237
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,199
(birdsong)
- ...and with that...

238
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,269
comes a huge degree
of responsibility.

239
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,510
Now, we often think of ourselves
are scions of free will,

240
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,078
of...

241
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,807
choice, of...

242
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,681
personal desire.

243
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,990
Now, that simply isn't the case.

244
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,123
Every moment we experience

245
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,818
contains not only a series
of consequences,

246
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:36,401
but is also the product
of a predetermined blueprint

247
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,603
set out for us by our Good Lord.

248
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,266
Now, as much
as we want to fight the notion,

249
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,036
nothing in this life is random.

250
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,666
Each situation we encounter

251
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,980
brings us closer to the truth
of our existence.

252
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,075
And it is our responsibility

253
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,347
to suffer the consequences
of our actions.

254
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,015
Now thank you.

255
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:03,017
Thank you for coming
and God bless.

256
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,126
(doorbell ringing)

257
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,532
- So how do I get you
a new one?

258
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,028
- What, my camera?

259
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,670
It's no use.

260
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,844
- No.
I have a responsibility to you,

261
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,114
and to fixing your camera.

262
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,043
- Yeah, yeah, you do.

263
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,479
- So what do I do?

264
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,678
- The store's closed today.

265
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,776
I'll meet you at your place
tomorrow.

266
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,448
You can hook me up then.

267
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,117
- What time?
- Say 10:00?

268
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,285
- And how much money do I need?

269
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,394
- Fifty bucks,
but bring more to be safe.

270
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,786
- Deal.
- Deal.

271
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,628
And hey. Your muffin
was freakin' delicious.

272
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:46,325
- That was for your dad.
- I'll see ya tomorrow.

273
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,970
- I said hello, Mum! Mum?

274
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,511
- Not now, Claire.

275
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,211
This is pointless.

276
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,121
- Do you need a hand?

277
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,753
Mum?

278
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,718
- Do you call this clean?

279
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,387
- It looks clean.

280
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,086
- Well, it isn't.
- Mum...

281
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,229
tomorrow I have to fix
something I broke.

282
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,325
- What did you break, honey?

283
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,297
- Someone's camera.

284
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,639
It's my responsibility.

285
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,572
- Your responsibility...

286
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:28,067
is to our family and this home.

287
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,641
Anything else is self-serving...

288
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,822
...and I won't allow it
under this roof.

289
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,215
- Are you okay, Mum?

290
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,217
- It's disgusting.

291
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,920
It's filthy.

292
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,731
- The sermon was great, Mum.

293
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,404
- Not now, Claire.

294
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,875
(celestial music)

295
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,322
- It is our responsibility
to suffer the consequences

296
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,416
of our actions.

297
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,162
(engine stalling)

298
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,798
(sighing)

299
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,172
- When was the last time
you used this thing?

300
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,343
(engine stalling)

301
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,171
Did you hear that?

302
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,897
- No.

303
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,080
(engine stalling, then starting)

304
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,306
I don't know about this.
- This was your idea.

305
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,850
I thought you wanted
to do the right thing.

306
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,646
- I do. I do.

307
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:50,619
I just... I've... I've...
never taken her car before.

308
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,555
- We'll be back in no time.

309
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,757
- Okay.

310
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,998
I have to be back
before the timer goes off.

311
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,695
- Uh...

312
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,537
alright.

313
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,237
(radio): Residents are asked
to keep an eye out

314
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,836
for the alleged sex offender
whom,

315
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,877
as a result of last Wednesday,
some are now calling

316
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,152
the Diddler on the Roof.
The man is described as--

317
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,652
- Gross.

318
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,284
- So how long
is this gonna take?

319
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,090
- Not long.

320
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,891
- Stop.

321
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,661
Stop!
- What?

322
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,165
(seatbelt clicking)

323
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,307
- Okay. Drive...

324
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,073
Jeeves!

325
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,281
- Okay, freak.

326
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,214
- Gas levels acceptable,
Captain?

327
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,080
- Assuming the gauge works,
we're at a quarter of a tank.

328
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,490
- Attagirl! Eyes on the road.

329
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,123
(radio): Another casualty
of the power outages

330
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,828
from last month
was the local sperm bank.

331
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:02,761
Due to their freezers not being
able to run at full efficiency,

332
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,729
there was an estimated loss
of four-quadrillion sperm.

333
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,928
We were able to find...
- This is weird.

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,440
Can we listen to something else?

335
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,213
- What do you wanna listen to?

336
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,812
- Sound of the wind.

337
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,814
- He's asking all male locals
to donate today.

338
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,547
- Yay!

339
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,722
(light music)
Ah...!

340
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,385
Ah...

341
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,297
(music)

342
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,417
(ticking)

343
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,611
(ding!)

344
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,617
(knocking)

345
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,420
- Hey, I gotta step out
for a moment

346
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,186
to finalize
some Jamboree planning.

347
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,364
Um... Tsk.

348
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:40,164
Look... Danielle, uh...

349
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:44,196
I would really like to sit down
and talk with you tonight.

350
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,633
I... I found another bottle.

351
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,782
Okay, well,
if you're ignoring me,

352
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:58,012
then you probably won't hear

353
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,977
that I left some money for food
on the fridge.

354
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,815
- O...kay.

355
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,559
Uh...

356
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:13,458
- What's wrong?

357
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:16,256
- I don't like this.

358
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,258
- We're almost there.

359
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,070
- Pull over.

360
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,702
Pull over!

361
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,898
Pull over. Pull... pull over.
Pull over.

362
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,511
- Okay.

363
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,141
Pull over. Pull over.

364
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,614
Pull over.

365
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,420
(Claire panting)
- Oh, my God, what?!

366
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:38,853
(exclaiming)

367
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,956
(exclaiming)

368
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,428
(groaning)

369
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:07,051
(Claire taking deep breaths)

370
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,420
Are you okay?

371
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,453
- Oh...

372
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,189
Oh... I don't know.

373
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,529
- Well... are you hungry?

374
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:22,632
Did you eat anything today?

375
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,055
- I'm always hungry.

376
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,156
Mmm... good sandwich.

377
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,222
Thanks. It's lettuce.

378
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,331
- It's really good.

379
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,103
- Good.

380
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,234
- Mmm.

381
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,336
- Hey, so, like...

382
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,605
what's the deal with your mom?

383
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,105
You know, like,
what's her thing?

384
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,505
- What do you mean?

385
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,781
She's... wonderful.

386
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,187
- Dude, she keeps you locked up.

387
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,222
- No, she doesn't.

388
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,725
I chose to be home-schooled.

389
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,596
- Let me at least
sit on your face

390
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,362
if you're gonna go
all Pinocchio on me.

391
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,471
(laughing)
- Gross.

392
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,073
- I'm not judging.

393
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,965
I'm just observing
with intense criticism.

394
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,337
Like...

395
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,538
like, what do you think
she's feeling right now,

396
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,381
the fact
that you just took her car?

397
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,145
Seriously?

398
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,992
- I'm sure she's fine.
- Claire.

399
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,457
- She is.

400
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,656
- If you haven't noticed,
I'm not a fan of lying.

401
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,995
- Okay, okay.

402
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,896
She's probably
balling her face off.

403
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,299
(sighing)
- Claire, that's insane.

404
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,911
You are just taking your friend
to the next town over

405
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:20,005
to buy her a new camera
from the one that you broke.

406
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,583
What?
- You said friend!

407
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,420
(Danielle snorting)
- Okay, okay,

408
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,654
we're not going all that.

409
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,420
Let's go.
We're almost to Deersmith.

410
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,059
- Deersmith?

411
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,094
That's where
my grandparents live.

412
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,630
- No shit. Your mom won't be
mad at us for visiting them.

413
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,326
Let's go.
- Oh!

414
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,127
We can visit them?!

415
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,599
- Yeah! Let's go!

416
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:46,009
- Oh, my goodness,
that would be swell!

417
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,809
- Were you dropped on your head
as a child?

418
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,779
- No. Why?

419
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,405
- Just saying,
the way you talk is so--

420
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,751
- Refined?

421
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,317
- Annoying.

422
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:01,045
- Oh.

423
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:07,234
- Hey, we're gonna make
a grandparent pit stop, okay?

424
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,897
- Okay.

425
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,362
- But first the camera.

426
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,501
- Okay.

427
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,466
- Claire...!

428
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,365
(sobbing)

429
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,381
Claire, don't do this to me!

430
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,921
Please...

431
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,386
I'm sorry!!

432
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,255
I'm sorry!

433
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:49,502
- Okay, now just follow my lead.

434
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:52,198
- Roger that.

435
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,211
- Yeah.

436
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,014
- Hey.

437
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,046
- Hey. Huh...
- Hey, I called this morning,

438
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:03,381
and they said that they had
a Canon 310 XL on hold for me.

439
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,319
- Oh, yeah, perfect.

440
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,994
Huh, you're perfect.

441
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,393
That's perfect, that's perfect.

442
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,685
Perfect.

443
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,688
- So can I get it?

444
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,600
- Get what?
- The camera.

445
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:20,232
- Oh, yeah, we have
a large variety of cameras.

446
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,739
Do you know the brand?
- Canon.

447
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,702
- Okay, Canon. And the model?

448
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:29,212
- She told you, weirdo.
The 310 XL.

449
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:33,305
- Oh, yeah, yeah, of course,
of course. One sex.

450
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,109
Second, uh... Sex,

451
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,881
I don't... Wah, if... if only.

452
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,290
I mean, uh...
- Oh, oh... He's bizarro.

453
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,363
- I know. He likes me.

454
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,962
- Well, he shouldn't ignore you,
then.

455
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,503
- Remind me to get you
a personal massager.

456
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,662
- Mom has one of those.

457
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,731
(chuckling)
- No doubt.

458
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,900
- Oh, that's so nice of you.

459
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,738
(sighing)
- Nope.

460
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:59,344
Uh, sorry.

461
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,975
- What? Uh, she said
they had it this morning.

462
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,242
- Well, sorry, we don't.

463
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,081
- Shit.

464
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,516
- We do have this Beaulieu R8.

465
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,222
- Yeah, how much is that?

466
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,754
- Um, I can give it to you
for 65.

467
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,821
- Fifty.
- I can't. My mom won't let me.

468
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,390
- Aw.

469
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,488
Look, pumpkin,
another home-schooler.

470
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:26,072
- Okay, fine. Fifty. Cash.

471
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,502
- Great. Fork it over, sister.

472
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,609
And a roll of film. Both: 50.

473
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,544
- I can't. I can't.

474
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,784
Okay. You know, okay, here.
Uh...

475
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:48,492
(laughing)
- Great. Have a nice day.

476
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:49,894
- Okay. Two?

477
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,586
I... No?
- Oh! No...

478
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,387
(laughter)

479
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:56,961
Aren't you gonna ask
for his number?

480
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,869
- Pfft. Man,
I have so much to teach you.

481
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,302
- No, you don't.
Mum's done a great job.

482
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:04,468
- Yeah.
Let's hit the Raisin Ranch.

483
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,306
- Okay.

484
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,820
Hi.

485
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,101
Uh... hello?

486
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:36,172
- Greetings,
and welcome to Grasswinds.

487
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,295
- When are your visiting hours?

488
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,840
- 5 to 7.

489
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,636
- Uh, a.m. or p.m.?

490
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,907
- Either way, you're either
too late or too early.

491
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:48,147
- Uh... we can wait.
- Wait, what?

492
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,384
- You'll wait. We all wait.

493
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,279
- Thank you.

494
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,993
- Hmm.

495
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:00,034
- We can't wait here that long.

496
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,132
- We're here now.

497
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,230
- Exactly.

498
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,068
Excuse me?

499
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,802
Yo!

500
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,510
- Yes, my darling.

501
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,283
- Do you have a restroom?

502
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,042
- Grasswinds is a place of rest.

503
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,080
We don't isolate it
to one room.

504
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:23,276
But if you need
to filter your kidneys or...

505
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:26,589
expunge your bowels,
down the hall, first left.

506
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,628
(sighing contentedly)

507
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,726
- I don't have to go.
- Neither do I.

508
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,729
(music playing)
Look.

509
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,241
- Oh!!

510
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:48,774
I've never taken
a dance class before.

511
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,610
- Do you see your grandparents?

512
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,249
- No.

513
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:58,354
I haven't seen them
since I was 12.

514
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,921
- But you'd recognize them,
right?

515
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,088
- Of course.

516
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,826
I send them a picture of me
every birthday

517
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,162
to keep me fresh in their minds.

518
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:13,732
- Claire? Claire!
- Nana!

519
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,829
- Oh...
- Nana!

520
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,671
Oh!

521
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,914
- Come here, Claire bear!
Come here!

522
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:24,013
- Pop-Pop!
- Ah...!!

523
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:29,054
Ah! Oh, look at you!

524
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,275
(laughing)
- But...

525
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,790
Mum said you had dementia
and that you could barely move.

526
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,423
- Really?
- Catherine.

527
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:39,558
- She has some nerve.
- Remember your exercises.

528
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,155
- Mmm...

529
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:42,687
Ah!
- What?

530
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,171
- Your mother and I
have entirely different ways

531
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:49,202
of moving through our journey
of existence.

532
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:52,398
- Why would she say that
about you?

533
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:55,709
- It's... complicated.

534
00:32:56,508 --> 00:33:00,078
But... look! Look at you!
I am so glad to see you!

535
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:02,146
We have so much to talk about.

536
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,954
Honey, there is a beautiful
garden in the back.

537
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:07,117
Let's talk!
- Oh, that's a great idea.

538
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,356
- Okay, okay!
(laughing)

539
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,161
Oh!

540
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:12,923
This is my friend,

541
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,631
Danielle.
- Hey.

542
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,703
Listen, I'll let you guys
do your thing.

543
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:19,602
It sounds like you have a lot
to catch up on.

544
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,465
Plus I need to take footage
of this place.

545
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,844
- Well, thank you, dear,
but be careful.

546
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:27,543
They don't allow cameras here.

547
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,206
- Oh. Shhh.

548
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,835
(giggling)
- Come on.

549
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,280
- That's my friend.

550
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,946
- She's very nice.

551
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,575
- Danielle, I'm home! Finally.

552
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,890
Sorry, it took longer
than I thought.

553
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,123
(knocking)
Danielle?

554
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,625
(soft music)

555
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,313
(soft music)

556
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,850
(sighing)

557
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:12,315
(phone chiming)

558
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,886
(soft music)

559
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,155
(birdsong)

560
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,738
- You get this
when you get older.

561
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,080
(sniffling)
Oh, gosh.

562
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,907
Ah...
(sniffling)

563
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,021
Oh...

564
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,093
- Hey.

565
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:50,523
- Hey.
- You ready to go?

566
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,833
(soft music)

567
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:01,474
Everything okay?
- She's gonna be just fine.

568
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:05,303
- You can visit us anytime.
- Anytime.

569
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:08,741
- I will.
(grandmother chuckling)

570
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:13,146
(sighing)
- Love to your mother.

571
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,552
- Can we not talk about her,
please?

572
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,546
- Oh, dinner... is on us.

573
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,017
(Claire giggling)

574
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,218
- Thanks, Pop-Pop.

575
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,989
I don't wanna go.

576
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,000
- Oh...
- Honey, we have to go.

577
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,732
They're gonna wonder
where we are at karaoke class.

578
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,570
- Awesome.

579
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,240
- Oh, sunshine...
everything will be just fine.

580
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,952
You keep an eye on her.

581
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,783
- I will.
- Okay.

582
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,589
- Uh, what she said.

583
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,901
- You ready?

584
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,599
(sighing)

585
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,442
(sighing)

586
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,008
(sighing)

587
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,607
So what'd you guys talk about?

588
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:27,453
- Can we just get out of here,
please?

589
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,457
- Yeah, totally.

590
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,631
Um... where?

591
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,299
- I don't care.

592
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,932
I just can't go home right now.

593
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,813
- Okay.

594
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,380
(sighing)

595
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,478
- Give me strength.

596
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,250
- Yes?
- It's me.

597
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,247
It's Paul.

598
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,849
Is, uh, is Claire home?

599
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,415
- No.

600
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,730
Someone stole my Claire
and my car.

601
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:44,433
- What are you talking about?

602
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,526
Open the door!

603
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:54,008
- Ah...

604
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,735
You've aged.

605
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,950
- We both have.

606
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,045
Can I come in?

607
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,489
- I've lost her, haven't I?
- No.

608
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,959
- Then why would she just leave
like that?

609
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,127
- I think that you know
the answer to that.

610
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,767
What did she say when she left?

611
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,773
- She didn't tell me anything.

612
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,135
She just said that she had
a responsibility

613
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,475
to fix some broken camera.

614
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,481
- Danielle.

615
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,683
Look, I am sure
that they'll be back tonight.

616
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,846
And I'll wait with you
until they are.

617
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,746
(kettle whistling)

618
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,123
Let me get that.

619
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,789
- All... all... all we have
is English Breakfast.

620
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,998
- It's... it's good to see you
and I am not here for the tea,

621
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,661
Henrietta.
- Ah...

622
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,200
we have a splash of milk,
thank God.

623
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,665
Claire used all the milk
when she made her muffins--

624
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:59,636
- Henrietta.
- And, um, sugar.

625
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,235
You still take sugar, right?

626
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,137
- Henrietta. Henrietta.

627
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,749
Everything is gonna be okay.

628
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,776
(soft music)

629
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,231
- So, uh, what'd
your grandparents tell you?

630
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,163
- Enough to make this feel

631
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,469
like this is the best decision
I've ever made.

632
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:31,843
- Amen, sister.
Anywhere in particular?

633
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,843
- Like I said...

634
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,835
I don't care.
(laughing)

635
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:39,547
- We'll just go to the next gas
station and take it from there.

636
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,911
- Sounds like a plan.

637
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,117
(crickets chirring)

638
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,062
(bell tinkling)

639
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,863
- Restroom?

640
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,325
- Back there.

641
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,933
- Hey, hey, will you get me
chips, beef jerky and water?

642
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,567
And coffee.
Two creams, no sugar.

643
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,443
- Okay. Oh!

644
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,613
- I might be a while.

645
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,012
Hi.

646
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:19,153
- Hi.

647
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:23,886
- You know where you are?
- Now I do.

648
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:27,055
- Well, that makes one of us.
(laughing)

649
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,955
- There isn't anyone in there,
by the way.

650
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,028
- Oh. Thanks.

651
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,440
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

652
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,480
- Do you have
any white "Zenvendel"?

653
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,146
- Are you old enough?
- I sure am.

654
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,045
I bought some earlier this week.

655
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,247
- Oh, good for you.
It's in the back left.

656
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,720
- Neato!
(laughing)

657
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,970
- Hey, um...

658
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,636
I'll throw in a couple
of free jerkies

659
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,605
if you eat one real slow.

660
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,044
- Oh, that's so sweet of you.

661
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,768
- How far back can you put it?

662
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,671
(gagging)

663
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,496
Okay, that's enough.

664
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:49,512
Um, that'll be... 15.75.

665
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:51,235
- Okay.

666
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,247
One, two,

667
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:02,516
three, four, five, 15.

668
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,255
Fifty...

669
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,187
Sixty... 85.

670
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,159
You owe me a dime.

671
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:16,942
Oh.
(giggling)

672
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,769
- Here ya go.

673
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:22,438
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

674
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:24,737
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

675
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,157
- Hello.

676
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,826
- Hi.

677
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:48,196
I'm just waiting for my friend,
but I should probably pee too.

678
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:51,166
(laughing)
- Yes, you probably should.

679
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,210
- I like your guitar.

680
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,612
- Thank you.
It's a ukulele, actually.

681
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:59,905
- Oh, it's so cute.
Are you in a band?

682
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:03,048
- No.
Nah, I'm just doing my thing.

683
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:07,194
- Me too. Just doing my thing.
(laughing)

684
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,589
Are you lost?

685
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:12,586
- Sometimes.

686
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:14,058
- Where you going?

687
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,825
We're going
to the Pump Up the Jamboree.

688
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:20,803
- No way.
That's where I'm going.

689
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,296
Wh-where is it exactly?

690
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,897
- Ah.

691
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,339
Oh...

692
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,205
It's right here.

693
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,283
- Yeah.

694
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,618
- Do you need a lift?

695
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,685
- That would be great, yeah.

696
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:45,457
- Ours is the station wagon
out front.

697
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:46,963
Here, make yourself comfy.

698
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:49,255
- This is amazing. Thank you.

699
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:53,157
- I think she's pooing,
but I'll be real quick.

700
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,071
- Excellent news.

701
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,910
(toilet flushing)

702
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:14,485
- Where'd that guy go?
- Outside. He's coming with us.

703
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:17,092
- What?
- I gave him the keys.

704
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,825
He's heading to the Jamboree!
- My dad's thing?

705
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:23,492
- Yeah. He asked me to go
the other day.

706
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:26,001
- And so now we're going?
- Yep.

707
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:28,404
- Okay, FYI, it's kinda lame.

708
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,966
- FYI, it's kinda perfect.

709
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,440
- Do you even know
what FYI means?

710
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,275
- Yes. Forgive your intentions.

711
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:41,206
- Wow. Yeah, let's go with that.
So where is he?

712
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:44,019
- In the car.
- You gave him the keys?!

713
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:46,682
- Why not?
He's heading to the Jamboree!

714
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:48,752
- Who does that?

715
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,822
(phone ringing)

716
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,062
- Claire!

717
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,497
Oh...

718
00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:01,432
I don't need to explain anything
to you, Mother.

719
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:04,874
Where?

720
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:06,806
Is she safe?

721
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:11,537
Is she safe?!
Is she still there?!

722
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,439
Is she safe?!

723
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,450
I do not need
to get into this with you!

724
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,091
Ah!
(sighing)

725
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:24,824
Ah.

726
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:35,174
- You know any lyrics?

727
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,474
- Of course I do.

728
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:44,777
* And then the ship *

729
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:47,053
* Came sailing to *

730
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,612
* The course of long begotten **

731
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,920
- Whoa, you're ridiculous.
- Uh, I think you mean fabulous.

732
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:56,185
(Claire giggling)

733
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,915
- You know,
I never got your names.

734
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,460
- I'm Danielle.
And she's Claire.

735
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,085
- Trevor.

736
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,160
I really appreciate this.
- Oh, it's no problem at all.

737
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,371
We're all going
to the same place, apparently.

738
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,373
- Lucky me.

739
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,835
- Lucky me.

740
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,943
- Lucky us!
(laughing)

741
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,105
- I'll drive.

742
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,050
- There ya go.
- Oh, thank you.

743
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,326
- Don't be ridiculous.
You'd be saving her.

744
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,727
- From what?

745
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,328
- From everything
that could harm her.

746
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:44,801
(Paul sighing)

747
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,110
- I can't go collect her
by myself, okay?

748
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:50,743
She's 24 years old,
for godssake!

749
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,278
- What are you saying?

750
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,983
- You know exactly
what I'm saying.

751
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,716
- Uh, uh. I can't. I can't.

752
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:02,346
- Fine. Fine. Then you'll just
have to wait this out, then.

753
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,990
- We'll call the cops.
- Call the cops?! And say what?

754
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,027
- I don't know.
Whatever it takes.

755
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:11,063
You're the pastor,
you know what to tell the...

756
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,829
- How about looking you
right in the eye

757
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:16,129
and telling you
that the only thing

758
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,441
that makes a cat an indoor cat,

759
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,743
is a lazy, self- centered,
obstinate owner.

760
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:23,975
An owner who doesn't wanna deal
with the responsibility

761
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,542
that that innocent cat
might just find out

762
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:30,021
that the backyard
is not all that scary after all,

763
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:32,551
but, instead,
is filled with beautiful,

764
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:36,117
wonderful moments
that are ripe for exploration.

765
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,318
If they're not back tonight.

766
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,030
I will be in your driveway
at 9 a.m. sharp.

767
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:45,534
Meet me there. Or don't.
Good night.

768
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,596
- Use the back door.

769
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:56,012
* Amazing grace *

770
00:47:56,074 --> 00:48:00,584
* How sweet the sound *

771
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:05,015
* That saved a wretch *

772
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:08,253
* Like me... *

773
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,689
(laughter)

774
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:13,764
* I once was lost *

775
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:18,434
* But now am found *

776
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:21,066
* Was blind *

777
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:26,172
* But now I see... *

778
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,437
- And now from the front seat!

779
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:31,506
* A... grace... *

780
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,147
* Was... *

781
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:36,252
* Born... **

782
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,360
(turning engine off)

783
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:48,256
Okay, guys, seriously,
what is the plan?

784
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:50,056
Where are we sleeping tonight?

785
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,628
- I'm good with pitching a tent.
- Ah!

786
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,097
- I bet you are.

787
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:57,095
- I'm good with outside!
Let's sleep under the stars!

788
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,568
- Well, I'm not.

789
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:02,266
How much money do we have
between the three of us?

790
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,280
- I've got, like, 30 bucks.
- Oh, it's okay.

791
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:08,013
We can cover you.
- Claire?

792
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,619
Can I have a word with you
outside, please?

793
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,381
- You know what?
I gotta find a tree anyway,

794
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,951
so I'll just leave you two
to talk.

795
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:17,591
- Oh, you should take this

796
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:20,425
in case you get more
than you bargained for.

797
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:23,491
- I'm good. Really.
(chuckling)

798
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,061
- Okay.

799
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:33,104
(door closing)
- What are you doing?

800
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:34,911
- Helping out.

801
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,512
- I don't know about this.

802
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,614
- Are you okay?
(Danielle sighing)

803
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,546
- What are we doing here?

804
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,951
- Having an adventure!

805
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,621
- Seriously, how much money
do we have?

806
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,094
- Hmm...
Well, with what I took from home

807
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:51,794
and what's left
of what Pop-Pop gave me,

808
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,456
70 bucks, around?

809
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,694
- That's not gonna be enough
for two rooms.

810
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,500
- Why do you want to be
in another room?

811
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:02,803
- For you.
He clearly wants to be with me.

812
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:05,167
- But we know songs.

813
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:08,036
- Well, I know
how to make music.

814
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:10,036
- But you were way off-key.

815
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:12,906
- I can hum.

816
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:14,747
- I...

817
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,019
Oh, do you like him?

818
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:22,916
- Obviously.
- Oh!

819
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:25,787
- Why? Do you?

820
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,686
- No.
(knocking)

821
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,699
- Good.

822
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,635
(whispering): Great. Fantastic.

823
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,778
(music playing)

824
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,793
- Hello.
- I don't want watermelon.

825
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,189
Oh, hey, sorry.
Must've dozed off.

826
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:03,329
How can I help you?

827
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,704
- We'd like a room
for the night.

828
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:09,073
- Uh-huh. You guys going
to the full-moon party

829
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:11,304
down in the woods?
- What? Full-moon party?

830
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:14,639
- Oh, no, sir, we're here
for the Pump Up the Jamboree.

831
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,765
- Oh, the Jesus thing?

832
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,341
So three rooms, I'm guessing?

833
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,610
- Two rooms. How much are they?

834
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,620
- Sixty. Each.

835
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:27,722
- Really? 'Cause the sign
outside says from 35.

836
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,815
- Yeah, well,
those are all taken.

837
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:34,017
- Shit. I mean, can't you just,
like, move the books around?

838
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,731
The owner will never know.

839
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,503
- Hmm.
Yeah, well, I'm the owner,

840
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:41,573
so the owner will know.
Sorry, can't go under 60.

841
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:44,202
I got horrible, unspeakable
vices that need fuelling.

842
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,939
- It's a Monday.

843
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,713
Are you really expecting
a crowd?

844
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:51,382
- Full-moon party. Sorry.
Can I go back to sleep now?

845
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:54,847
- Well, if we say no
to one room,

846
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:56,582
you'll have lost 60.

847
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:01,647
I know you offer two for 120,
but say you gave us two for 70,

848
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,089
that's 35 each,

849
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,894
then you're only 50 dollars shy
of what you're asking for,

850
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:10,296
and losing 50 is way easier
to process than losing 60.

851
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,561
Think of your horrible vices.

852
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,200
- Okay, that just hurt my brain,

853
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:17,666
but... you do have a point.

854
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:21,465
I'm pretty sure
I could get a BJ for 70 bucks.

855
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,969
Fine, 70 bucks, two rooms.

856
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,811
- Sixty!
- Don't push it.

857
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,606
- Guys, this is kind of you,

858
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,518
but I can't justify staying
in a room all by myself.

859
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:33,021
- No, you'll be with me.
- Sir, let's just take

860
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,423
the one room, please.
- Huh?

861
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,056
- I-I'll sleep on the floor.
- You guys are confusing

862
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:40,292
the shit out of me.
What do you want?

863
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:44,088
- One room, two beds, 50 bucks.
Deal?

864
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,061
- Yeah. Fine. Whatever.

865
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:50,771
Room 3. No smoking.

866
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,335
- Oh, we're clean-living.

867
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,513
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what they all say.

868
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:57,612
Then I find a condom
lodged in my neighbour's cat.

869
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,645
It was so deep in there...

870
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:10,146
- Oh!
Oh, wow, what a big bed!

871
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,521
- Uh,
I'll get to the bottom of this.

872
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,573
- Has anyone ever told you
how pretty you are?

873
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,437
- My mum.
- Well...

874
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:32,307
has a man ever told you
how pretty you are?

875
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,580
- Yes.
Just before he was convicted.

876
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:39,877
- You're not gonna make this
easy for me.

877
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,890
- Sorry...?

878
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,992
- You're very pretty.

879
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:49,362
- Thanks.

880
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:51,797
So are you.

881
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:58,072
- Well... apparently
this is the last room, so...

882
00:53:58,135 --> 00:53:59,695
- Oh!
- Don't worry,

883
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,540
you're not sleeping
on the floor, mister.

884
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:05,707
- As long as it's hands
above covers, folks!

885
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:09,876
- That's what my mum says
when I touch my no-no garden.

886
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,677
(Claire laughing)

887
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,323
- So, girl, boy, girl?

888
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:16,786
- Works for me.

889
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:19,824
- Oh!
We don't have any jammies.

890
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,958
- No, no, we don't.

891
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:26,498
- How about a couple of these?

892
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,903
Huh?

893
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,170
- Cool. Oh!

894
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,379
(snorting)

895
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,876
(slow rock music)

896
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:14,577
(muffled screaming)

897
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,148
(slow rock music)

898
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:22,047
(screaming)

899
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:40,969
(Danielle screaming)

900
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:46,476
(slow instrumental rock version
of Amazing Grace)

901
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,475
(music fading)

902
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,630
(light music)

903
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,884
Ow.

904
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,758
Dear Lord,

905
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,897
this adventure is confusing,

906
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:15,102
but I know it's part
of your plan for me.

907
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,535
(yipping in distance)

908
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:25,608
Please help Mum.

909
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:29,176
I love her...
but I'm frustrated.

910
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,050
I do know I have to go
to the jamboree.

911
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,751
Also, thank you so much
for Danielle.

912
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:41,091
I had asked for a friend
for so long and she's perfect.

913
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:44,258
Oh, and aren't we supposed
to celebrate your creations?

914
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:47,128
I mean, if families traveled
thousands of miles

915
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,797
to see Mount Rushmore,

916
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:51,796
then certainly it's okay
to show my jelly jams.

917
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:54,469
I'll take that as a yes.
It's hot in here.

918
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:56,569
Thanks, God.

919
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,084
Good night, Mum.

920
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:13,919
(honking)

921
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,103
(honking)

922
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:27,612
(nervous breathing)

923
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:36,611
- Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no.

924
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:38,681
No... No, that's...

925
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,689
No, that's... No, that's...

926
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:43,191
(knocking)
No, that's different. No.

927
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,993
(insistent knocking)

928
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:46,515
No...

929
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:48,531
- Argh! Enough! Henrietta?

930
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:50,163
Henrietta!

931
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:53,757
Fine! But if you don't get out
here right now and join me,

932
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,531
I'm taking that car back
immediately.

933
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,070
- I-I... I have a condition.

934
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,004
- Argh!
Keep telling yourself that.

935
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:02,669
And you find me one doctor
in town to support that myth.

936
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,010
- Why are you being so mean
to me?

937
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,745
- Mean?
Oh, you want me to be mean?

938
00:59:07,812 --> 00:59:11,282
I can be mean. Let's have
a little mean, shall we?

939
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:13,478
Ahem. No one cares anymore,
Henrietta.

940
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,290
People's lives have moved on.
Alright?

941
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:18,292
Now you're just that weird lady
who stopped living

942
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,755
to ensure that her daughter
doesn't live.

943
00:59:20,825 --> 00:59:23,755
Best you stay locked up
in your parents' house!

944
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:26,028
That'll teach them a lesson!
(Henrietta moaning)

945
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:28,526
- How dare you?! No!!!
- Come on.

946
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,899
No, just... We're good.
You're fine.

947
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:33,398
- No!! No!
- Here we go.

948
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,710
- Ah...!!! No!!
- Prove me wrong.

949
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:38,983
- Ah!!
- Prove me wrong! Here we go.

950
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:42,713
(groaning)
Prove me wrong. Prove me wrong.

951
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:57,863
- Trevor?

952
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,333
Hello?

953
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,289
Hey, what the hell happened?!

954
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,287
- What? Wh-what happened?

955
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,360
- What happened last night?!

956
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:36,334
- Where's Trevor?
- Yeah, where's Trevor?!

957
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,300
Your fucking tits come out
and he bolts!

958
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,639
- Don't call them that.

959
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:42,335
- What did you do?

960
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,236
- Nothing.
- Nothing?!

961
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:47,878
God, that's bullshit. You know,
he really liked me, okay?

962
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:52,075
- Oh, wouldn't he have paid you
more attention, then?

963
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:55,319
(scoffing)
- And I saw him first.

964
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:58,485
I can't believe that you would
box-block me like that!

965
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:00,615
- What does that even mean?

966
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:03,091
Danielle, why are you so mad?

967
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,760
- Why are you
so fucking clueless?!

968
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,730
- I'm not, though.

969
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,068
He was really different
around you.

970
01:01:10,134 --> 01:01:13,844
And you weren't you around him.
It was weird.

971
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:16,814
- He liked me, okay?!

972
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:20,375
- Bu...
(door slamming)

973
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:28,492
(radio): ...by the association
of men with women's names,

974
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:31,562
and it hopes to draw attention
to these difficulties.

975
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,861
- Do you want to listen
to anything in particular?

976
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:36,755
- Uh, anything
to calm my nerves.

977
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:39,227
(laughing)
- Okay, Blanche.

978
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:41,526
(scanning stations)

979
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:44,268
(soft music playing)

980
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,143
- Better.

981
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,438
(soft guitar music)

982
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:04,392
* You might be desperate *

983
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:07,194
* And on your last legs *

984
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:11,997
* But you're not falling out *

985
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,699
* I don't know how *

986
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,898
* You always manage *

987
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:24,340
* To fight another round *

988
01:02:27,812 --> 01:02:32,752
* You always ride it out *

989
01:02:32,817 --> 01:02:37,817
* You always
ride it out somehow *

990
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,860
* You always ride it out *

991
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:48,628
* You always
ride it out somehow *

992
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,498
(siren wailing)

993
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,870
* I come to see you *

994
01:02:54,939 --> 01:02:58,839
* And all
that you've been through *

995
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:02,679
* Never shows up on your face *

996
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:09,124
* You go on and on
and you smile so warm *

997
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:11,016
* Though the world *

998
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:15,228
* Can be such a cold place *

999
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:22,974
* You always ride it out *

1000
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:27,543
* You always
ride it out somehow *

1001
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:34,437
* You always ride it out *

1002
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:40,075
* You always
ride it out somehow **

1003
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,921
(soft guitar music)

1004
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,995
(woman moaning)

1005
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,097
(crying out)

1006
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,480
(moaning)

1007
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:11,224
- Ugh, I'm really sorry
for being such a dick.

1008
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,681
(moaning)

1009
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:14,819
I really thought he liked me.

1010
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:17,585
- I don't even know what I did.

1011
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,629
You're, like, my best friend.

1012
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:26,231
- Oh, Claire.

1013
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:29,396
- Oh, Hal, spread me like jelly!

1014
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,396
- What are you watching?

1015
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,598
- Oh... this is amazing.

1016
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,414
(woman moaning)

1017
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:37,773
- Gross.

1018
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:40,481
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1019
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,384
- What?

1020
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:45,346
- This is vintage.
Look at her nails.

1021
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:49,215
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!
- Look at his back.

1022
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,556
- He loves her, doesn't he?

1023
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,991
(woman crying out)

1024
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,729
- Uh, no.

1025
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:59,003
No, he doesn't.

1026
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,897
- But...

1027
01:05:01,966 --> 01:05:04,066
(indistinct dialogue)

1028
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:07,904
But...
look what she's letting him do.

1029
01:05:07,972 --> 01:05:10,212
(woman crying out)

1030
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,580
Especially there.

1031
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,582
(woman): Ouch!

1032
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,254
Ah! Oh!

1033
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:20,584
Are you going to...

1034
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,590
Ah! ...the reunion?!

1035
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,763
Ah! Ooh!

1036
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:29,562
- Have... you ever done that?

1037
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,457
- Totally.
(man): Oh, yeah.

1038
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:35,729
* Row row row your boat... **

1039
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:39,139
- You know, we should probably
think of a plan.

1040
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:40,973
We're running low on funds.

1041
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:43,138
Do you have an ATM card?

1042
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:45,477
- Is that like
a pregnancy thing?

1043
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:49,882
- No, a bank card.
- No, we're cash only at home.

1044
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,976
Mum doesn't believe
in electronic--

1045
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,779
- Unless they're inside her?

1046
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,250
- What?
- Never mind.

1047
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,349
Seriously, though,
we need a plan.

1048
01:05:57,421 --> 01:06:01,561
- Well... I think
I need to go to Jamboree.

1049
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:06,095
I mean, I really wanna go
to the Jamboree.

1050
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:08,503
- Really?
- Yeah!

1051
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:15,342
- We'll barely make it there,
though,

1052
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:18,305
and we'll be skimping for food.

1053
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:21,875
- Well, if the Jews
spent 40 years in a desert,

1054
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:23,475
I think we'll be fine.

1055
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:26,317
- Okay, well, what about me?
- What about you?

1056
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:29,993
- I just get the pleasure
of dropping you off at Jamboree?

1057
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:31,824
- You can come!

1058
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:33,618
- Uh...

1059
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:37,890
- Besides, look how many pins
you'll get to put on your map.

1060
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:41,901
- That was the map of the world.
We're on Highway 6.

1061
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:45,635
- But we're more along Highway 6
than we were yesterday.

1062
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:48,942
- That's a good point. Okay.
Shit, I gotta pay.

1063
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,775
- Oh, suck on a beef jerky
real slow

1064
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,181
and they'll give you a free one.

1065
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,354
- We're at a different station.

1066
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:58,823
- Oh, I'm pretty sure
it's a universal truth.

1067
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:02,222
- I'm pretty sure it's not.
- Well, you...

1068
01:07:02,286 --> 01:07:05,286
You should just try it anyway!

1069
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,727
- Okay, alright.

1070
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:11,663
(Claire laughing)

1071
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:15,868
Yeah, you're doing it right.
Look through the viewfinder.

1072
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:19,302
And then focus on your feet.

1073
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:21,674
And then you'll notice

1074
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:24,538
that the focus
on the horizon softens.

1075
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:26,478
- Cool...!

1076
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:30,648
So what's all this filming for?

1077
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,354
- Oh, nothing.

1078
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,090
- It's not nothing.

1079
01:07:39,156 --> 01:07:41,326
- It's nothing.

1080
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,662
-= My mum says that when truth
is replaced by silence,

1081
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,700
the silence is a lie.

1082
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,335
- Okay, it's for my mom.

1083
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,713
- Oh, that's so nice.

1084
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:58,112
Where does she live?

1085
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:03,578
Oh...

1086
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:08,417
- No, it's okay. I mean,
she died when I was six, y'know?

1087
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:11,355
She was
in a really bad accident.

1088
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:14,887
You know, she never...

1089
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:18,928
got to finish the film
she was making, so...

1090
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:21,265
I don't know, it's stupid.

1091
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,138
- It's not stupid.

1092
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:29,543
- I have no idea what I'm doing.

1093
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:32,837
- Makes two of us.

1094
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,552
- Thanks.

1095
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,529
You wanna check that out?

1096
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:54,855
- Oh! Uh... yes!
- Yeah?

1097
01:08:58,168 --> 01:09:01,638
- Hey, Henrietta, don't
your folks live around here?

1098
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:04,765
- Uh... yes.

1099
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,811
- Quick pop-in?

1100
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:10,146
- Uh... no, thank you.

1101
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:12,254
- Okay.

1102
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,767
- Hello?
- Hello?!

1103
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,771
Hello?!

1104
01:09:35,071 --> 01:09:37,241
- Can I help you girls?

1105
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:40,037
- Oh. I'm here for the contest.

1106
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:43,209
- Are you now?
- Sure am, sir.

1107
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:48,290
- Well, we don't have karaoke
contest this early on a weekday,

1108
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:50,452
but that's unfortunate,
'cause, girls,

1109
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,790
I'd love to hear you sing.

1110
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:56,626
- We should go.
- The stage is all yours.

1111
01:09:57,427 --> 01:10:00,597
I could hum for ya.

1112
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,934
Hmmmmmmm...

1113
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:09,811
Heeeeh....

1114
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:13,641
Mm-hmm...

1115
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,884
Hmm-hmm-hmm...
(door closing)

1116
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,246
Hmm... hmm...

1117
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:21,646
Heeeh...

1118
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,960
- Could you roll the window down
for me, please?

1119
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:32,896
- Uh, could...
could we keep it up, please?

1120
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,862
- Window down!

1121
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,844
License and registration.

1122
01:10:41,137 --> 01:10:43,237
Everything okay there, ma'am?

1123
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:44,637
- Oh, yes, she's, uh...
agoraphobic.

1124
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,178
- I won't pretend to know
what that means.

1125
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,513
- I have a great fear
of being in--

1126
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,049
- And I won't pretend to care.

1127
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:53,715
- Okay...

1128
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,793
- You rolled through that stop,
mister.

1129
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:58,392
- I did, didn't I?
- You certainly did.

1130
01:10:58,455 --> 01:10:59,885
Bad boy.
- Well, I'm...

1131
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:03,186
I'm very sorry, Officer.
I'm a man of the cloth and--

1132
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,599
- So why the rolling stop,
Paul?

1133
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,702
- Well, we...
we were preoccupied.

1134
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:11,944
Our daughters just up and left
this morning and so--

1135
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,241
- Your daughters?
- Uh, well... daughters.

1136
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:17,614
He has a daughter,
I have a daughter.

1137
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:19,244
They're separate daughters.

1138
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:24,309
And... and I have a sense
of where they're heading, uh,

1139
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:26,221
but, you know,
they could be anywhere.

1140
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,752
- Whose vehicle are they in?

1141
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:31,047
- They are in mine, Officer.
- Yeah, this is a rental.

1142
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,190
- Oh, there goes my crush.

1143
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:37,427
Look, give me the license plate
number and I'll put out a call.

1144
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:42,204
I know some of the motel owners
around here.

1145
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:44,925
- Oh, okay it's, uh, S4326...

1146
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,671
(engine stalling)

1147
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:49,307
- Shit.

1148
01:11:49,373 --> 01:11:52,443
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit!

1149
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:55,179
- What?
- Car's dead.

1150
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:58,984
- Uh... everything will be okay.

1151
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:03,746
What?

1152
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:08,060
- I skip town and my dad
only calls me three times?

1153
01:12:09,526 --> 01:12:12,756
I bet your mom's going berserk.

1154
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,870
- Yeah...

1155
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:19,071
Let her.

1156
01:12:20,737 --> 01:12:24,337
- Okay, according to my phone,
there's a gas station...

1157
01:12:24,408 --> 01:12:26,938
that way a little ways.

1158
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,514
- Should we walk?

1159
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,719
- I'm not going back in there.

1160
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,182
- Okay!

1161
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,590
Wait here one second.

1162
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:38,793
- Well, it looks
like a Danielle Logan

1163
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:42,025
checked into the Shady Pines
on Highway 8 last night.

1164
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:45,261
- That's my girl.
- So let's go check it out.

1165
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,358
Follow me.
- Thank you, thank you.

1166
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:49,701
Thank you very much.
You see?

1167
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,642
- Oh, cool!

1168
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,210
Look at these!

1169
01:12:58,274 --> 01:13:00,484
(Danielle laughing)

1170
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:03,551
- Henrietta!

1171
01:13:07,451 --> 01:13:09,751
Oh!
- Oh.

1172
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,592
(giggling)
- What?

1173
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:19,097
- Here.

1174
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,002
As a thanks.

1175
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:39,183
Did I do something wrong?

1176
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,517
- No.

1177
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,250
No.

1178
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:48,891
That was really, really sweet.

1179
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,658
Thank you.

1180
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:53,527
- That's your favourite, right?

1181
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,174
- My mom used to drink it.

1182
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:02,105
The smell of the cork
reminds me of her.

1183
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,180
- Well...

1184
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,320
We're finishing her film,

1185
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:16,122
we should drink it
in her honour.

1186
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,885
- I'm not gonna argue with that.

1187
01:14:21,525 --> 01:14:23,285
This looks good on you.

1188
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,899
- Thanks! I like yours, too.

1189
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,134
(music)

1190
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,569
(indistinct chatter)

1191
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:46,352
- Yeah, the boy left
around 6 a.m. this morning.

1192
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:47,915
He seemed kind of stressed.

1193
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,994
Also,
someone owes me some money.

1194
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:53,323
There's an outstanding charge
for, uh, a "blue" movie.

1195
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,659
- Blue?

1196
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:58,485
- Pfft. Good girls, I see.
- Yeah.

1197
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:01,132
- The best. Well, mine is.

1198
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:03,567
- Which flick?
- Oh, it's a good one.

1199
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,303
Uh, Second Cousin
Twice Removed.

1200
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:07,998
Classic.

1201
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,639
- What? What?

1202
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:17,149
There was definitely something
in that look.

1203
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,553
(music)

1204
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:21,746
(indistinct chatter)

1205
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:25,118
- Best friends!
(laughter)

1206
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:29,793
(...music...)

1207
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:41,969
(...music...)

1208
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,789
(...music...)

1209
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:05,289
- Whoo!

1210
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,571
(music fading)

1211
01:16:13,637 --> 01:16:15,667
(howling)

1212
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:19,914
This is...

1213
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:21,406
(gasping)

1214
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:24,147
This is so...

1215
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:25,923
cool!

1216
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:30,552
- Are you little girls out here
in the forest all by yourselves?

1217
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,020
- Oh, we sure are.

1218
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,129
- Welcome
to the full-moon party.

1219
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,032
(phone ringing)

1220
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:41,966
Hello?

1221
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,301
So sorry.

1222
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,126
Yeah?

1223
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:46,941
No, no.

1224
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:50,674
It's like my one big night.

1225
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,611
We can get whatever's
in the basement out tomorrow.

1226
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,049
Yeah, look, I gotta go.

1227
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,148
So sorry.
(chuckling)

1228
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,747
You guys tripping?

1229
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:06,959
You have to try
my super-spicy space cakes.

1230
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:09,993
(music playing)
What's the matter?

1231
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:12,429
- We're lost
and our car broke down.

1232
01:17:12,495 --> 01:17:13,925
- Claire!

1233
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:17,197
- That is such a bummer. Where?

1234
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:18,966
- On our way here, yeah.

1235
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,705
- Look...
here's what needs to happen.

1236
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:24,441
You need to eat some cake,

1237
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,637
you need to get silly,

1238
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,380
and you need to dance.

1239
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:31,554
You're totally safe with me.

1240
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:36,815
Trust me. Seriously,
you girls are in for a treat.

1241
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:39,386
- Ah... ah...

1242
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:43,829
Whoa...
(speaking with mouth full)

1243
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,493
That's great.

1244
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:47,501
- Let's go.
- It is so good.

1245
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:49,903
- Yeah.
(laughter)

1246
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:52,996
(beat-heavy music)

1247
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:18,464
(demonic voice)
(techno music)

1248
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:28,099
- Now don't freak out.
Don't fall.

1249
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:30,104
- Ah.
- Okay?

1250
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:33,436
- Yeah.
- But imagine that wall gone.

1251
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,912
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

1252
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:38,742
Bedroom - bang.

1253
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,978
Upstairs fireplace,

1254
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:43,414
second bedroom.

1255
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:45,979
Oh, my fuck,

1256
01:19:46,049 --> 01:19:48,479
his croissants are to die for.

1257
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:49,991
Must have one now.

1258
01:19:50,053 --> 01:19:52,063
Oh, you're up.

1259
01:19:58,327 --> 01:19:59,727
- 'Morning.

1260
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,465
- Hi.

1261
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,671
- Hello. You're handsome.

1262
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:07,043
(chuckling)
- I'm Hal.

1263
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:10,343
- I'm Danielle. This is Claire.

1264
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:11,976
- We're girls.

1265
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:15,211
- I can tell. Hungry?

1266
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:18,208
- Starved.
- Follow me.

1267
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,918
- Mmm...
- We have more if you want.

1268
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:25,445
- Only if you have more
of this insane jam.

1269
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:28,821
- Jelly jams!
These are my jelly jams.

1270
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:30,462
(laughter)

1271
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:32,596
- Yes! Those are
your little jelly jams.

1272
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,661
- These are my jelly--
- I really like your jelly jams.

1273
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:38,471
- You like my jelly jams?
- They're really nice ones.

1274
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:41,504
- I really like your jelly jams.
- Thanks. You do?

1275
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,370
- Mm-hmm.
- Aw...!

1276
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,269
(laughter)

1277
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:49,581
- The car's been spotted.

1278
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:52,415
- Oh, wonderful.
- Uh, so we'll follow you, then?

1279
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:54,651
- No, no, no, we'll take my car.
Leave yours here.

1280
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:56,287
- Oh, that's very kind of you.

1281
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,522
- It is. But I'm not going
to drive you anywhere

1282
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,758
until you tell me
what's really going on here.

1283
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:04,625
- Here?

1284
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,195
(water running)
(groaning softly)

1285
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:13,437
(man): Ahem.
(Claire giggling)

1286
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,214
- Where's Artemis?

1287
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:19,713
- He's gone
to get your car fixed.

1288
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:22,145
- Oh, that's wonderful.

1289
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:25,349
Can I help with anything?

1290
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:29,054
- Well, uh, you can crack
some eggs over there.

1291
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,588
- Oh, I don't know
how to do that.

1292
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,324
- Seriously?

1293
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,433
- We buy the yolks
in the carton.

1294
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:39,362
(laughing)
- That is so suburban.

1295
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:42,568
Uh, come here, let me show you.

1296
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,571
Here we go.

1297
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,643
Okay, grab an egg.

1298
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:50,666
Okay, bump it just hard enough
to crack the shell,

1299
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,909
but gentle enough
not to damage the egg inside.

1300
01:21:53,977 --> 01:21:56,807
Ready? Okay, now...
(Claire exclaiming)

1301
01:21:57,613 --> 01:22:01,753
There you go. Look at that,
look at that, look at that!

1302
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:03,587
There we go.
- Oh!

1303
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,362
- Not bad, babe.
- Wow...

1304
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,926
Our house used to get egged.

1305
01:22:09,993 --> 01:22:11,763
- That's awful.

1306
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:13,527
- Yeah.

1307
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,736
- There you go.
- How am I doing?

1308
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:23,042
- I'd hire ya.
When you drop a little shell,

1309
01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:25,366
you just scrape it out
like that.

1310
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:28,211
There ya go.
Nothing to it. Keep going.

1311
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:31,247
- Uh... that's my car!

1312
01:22:31,314 --> 01:22:32,684
- The wagon?
- Uh-huh.

1313
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:35,048
- Who's the long-haired guy
under the hood?

1314
01:22:35,118 --> 01:22:37,088
- Did you see my Claire?!

1315
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:39,223
(siren wailing)

1316
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,230
(brakes squealing)

1317
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,075
(humming happily)

1318
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:02,313
- Oh! Mmm!

1319
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:04,508
Ah, they smell amazing!

1320
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:07,580
- It's all that vanilla
you added.

1321
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,420
- Uh, we have guests.
- More guests.

1322
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:17,161
- Smells great in here.
- Thanks.

1323
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:20,396
- Should we get the coffee
flowing here?

1324
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:21,863
- Hal?

1325
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:24,630
- Henrietta?
- Hello, Hal.

1326
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:28,470
- Mum? You know each other?
How do you know each other?

1327
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:31,607
- Oh, Jesus. Screw the coffee.
You have anything stronger?

1328
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:33,814
- How do you know each other?
- Officer Lori,

1329
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:36,646
Danielle, I think
we should leave them alone.

1330
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:39,622
Oh, dear God.
(Danielle groaning)

1331
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:41,752
- Oh, Jesus. Here.

1332
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:43,647
- I'm sorry.

1333
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:46,689
- Danielle, let's... let's...
let's... let's go.

1334
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,315
- Um, okay.

1335
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:51,661
Hal... Claire's your daughter.

1336
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:53,627
- What?!

1337
01:23:56,932 --> 01:23:58,702
(child giggling)

1338
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:07,084
- Excuse me?

1339
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:11,777
I'm really sorry, Claire.

1340
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:13,317
I had no idea.
- Oh!

1341
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:16,692
- Artemis, grab a towel,
grab a towel. I got her hair.

1342
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,692
- Sweetheart?
- Oh, baby. Towel. Oh, baby.

1343
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:22,485
Oof. I'm really sorry
about this, people.

1344
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,758
- Hal, would you like
to tell your daughter

1345
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:26,257
what line of work you're in?

1346
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:29,699
- Um, was in.
And you're being inappropriate.

1347
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:33,835
- And-and I'm very sorry,
who are you exactly?

1348
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,542
- Hal's lover.

1349
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:41,636
- What? Tell me.
- Tell her, Hal.

1350
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,410
- You're Hal Spreadum!

1351
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:45,679
That's an impressive
body of work.

1352
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:50,948
- Oh... he was in that movie
we saw, Claire.

1353
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,359
(soft music)

1354
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:57,760
- That woman didn't love you.

1355
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:00,196
- I know.

1356
01:25:02,998 --> 01:25:05,228
(soft piano music)

1357
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:46,237
- Great jam.

1358
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:56,246
(...soft piano music...)

1359
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,600
- Alright, you've had enough.
You're done.

1360
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,440
(soft piano music)

1361
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:24,850
So here's what's gonna
go down next, okay?

1362
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,983
Your car needs attention,

1363
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:29,749
so I can take the both of you
in the cruiser.

1364
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:32,488
Paul and Danielle
can take the rental car.

1365
01:26:32,555 --> 01:26:34,785
- No.

1366
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:37,587
I'm sorry, but no.

1367
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:43,200
Mum...I love you
with every core of my being.

1368
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:45,526
I do.

1369
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:48,201
But I'm going
to Pump Up the Jamboree,

1370
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,471
with Danielle.

1371
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:54,384
You guys can do
whatever you wanna do.

1372
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:56,253
But that's what I'm doing,

1373
01:26:57,746 --> 01:26:59,346
Okay?

1374
01:27:30,313 --> 01:27:32,353
- You don't need that.

1375
01:27:35,851 --> 01:27:37,051
(Danielle sighing)

1376
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:40,259
- You... you just don't get it,
do you, Paul?

1377
01:27:40,323 --> 01:27:43,363
- I hate it
when you call me that.

1378
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,699
Why can't you call me Dad?

1379
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:51,865
Hey...

1380
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:56,442
I'm trying to love you here,
Danielle.

1381
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:00,941
- Well,
then that makes two of us.

1382
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:10,617
- You okay?

1383
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,890
- Define okay.

1384
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:17,934
- Okay, look...

1385
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:21,233
I am very worried
about your drinking.

1386
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,466
I find bottles all the time.

1387
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:25,902
- Oh, she doesn't drink them.

1388
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:30,670
The smell of the cork
reminds her of her mom.

1389
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,740
I think it's nice.

1390
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,787
How is it in there?

1391
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:53,599
- Oh, it's weird
and heavy and awkward.

1392
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:57,272
Kind of like how I was
in high school.

1393
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,802
They're having
a long-overdue chat.

1394
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:03,568
It's a good thing.
- Man, you guys are awesome.

1395
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:06,479
- Ah, tell me something
I don't already know.

1396
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:09,952
(laughter)
- Thank you for everything.

1397
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,279
- It's my pleasure.

1398
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,978
You know what?

1399
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:18,050
We could kind of use a hand
around here

1400
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,020
until things get up and running.

1401
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,088
Just putting it out there.

1402
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:27,961
- Awesome.

1403
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:31,398
(Claire): Ah...

1404
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:38,165
- Thank you.

1405
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,510
- You're welcome.

1406
01:29:41,276 --> 01:29:43,806
- Uh, girls? We, uh...

1407
01:29:45,448 --> 01:29:47,748
- Behave yourselves!
- Okay.

1408
01:29:47,816 --> 01:29:49,116
(laughter)

1409
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,918
- That's your dad.

1410
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:54,388
(soft music)

1411
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:55,857
- We could help.
- I wanna go.

1412
01:29:55,924 --> 01:29:57,534
- We'll get you home
soon enough.

1413
01:29:57,593 --> 01:29:59,433
- No, I wanna go
to the jamboree.

1414
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:00,725
I wanna support my baby.

1415
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:05,096
- Wait, I want to support
my baby, too.

1416
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:07,237
- To the jamboree, then.

1417
01:30:07,302 --> 01:30:09,242
(chuckling)

1418
01:30:09,304 --> 01:30:12,244
- Here we go, doll.
- Okay.

1419
01:30:12,307 --> 01:30:14,137
Okay.

1420
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:18,011
- So glad you could come.

1421
01:30:19,648 --> 01:30:23,018
Okay, it's almost speech time.
(woman): ...our saviour!

1422
01:30:24,487 --> 01:30:26,517
(Claire giggling)

1423
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:33,627
I felt good about the way
I looked in my bathing suit,

1424
01:30:33,696 --> 01:30:37,866
and I found the courage
to go down the water slide.

1425
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,703
I found the courage
through his love.

1426
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:42,769
I love you, Christ Jesus!

1427
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:45,408
I love you with every pore!

1428
01:30:45,474 --> 01:30:47,544
(crowd cheering)

1429
01:30:49,578 --> 01:30:53,248
- Thank you so much, so much,
Maxine. How bout that, huh?

1430
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:55,715
That was some beautiful,
beautiful, heartfelt testimony.

1431
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,524
Thank you, thank you.
He's everywhere, isn't he?

1432
01:30:58,587 --> 01:31:00,457
(laughing)
Alright, now this is...

1433
01:31:00,523 --> 01:31:02,093
this is very exciting.

1434
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:06,497
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome for the very first time,

1435
01:31:06,562 --> 01:31:10,472
representing Penderson County,
our very own Claire Woods.

1436
01:31:10,533 --> 01:31:13,873
Let's pump it up for Claire!
Huh?

1437
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:15,766
Ha-ha-ha!

1438
01:31:15,838 --> 01:31:17,268
Yeah.

1439
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:19,209
Watch your step.

1440
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:30,492
- Thank you... Pastor Paul...

1441
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:32,453
for inviting me...

1442
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:34,491
to speak here.

1443
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:37,227
I've...

1444
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,632
been asked to speak...

1445
01:31:39,695 --> 01:31:42,225
about how my... spirituality

1446
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:47,237
has lead me to where I am now.

1447
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:51,274
Or... something.

1448
01:32:08,757 --> 01:32:11,427
All I know is that...

1449
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:14,163
you have to treat spirituality

1450
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:16,359
like a breakfast buffet.

1451
01:32:16,431 --> 01:32:18,531
Only eat what you crave.

1452
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:20,571
There's a reason you crave it.

1453
01:32:20,636 --> 01:32:22,296
And I have a new friend.

1454
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,670
(laughing)

1455
01:32:25,608 --> 01:32:28,278
And she's making
all the difference.

1456
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:33,217
And I just found out
that my dad's gay.

1457
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:36,821
And we made amazing croissants
this morning.

1458
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:40,085
And...
and he and his boyfriend are...

1459
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:45,255
creating a home away from home
for lost travellers.

1460
01:32:45,327 --> 01:32:47,157
Isn't that all of us?

1461
01:32:47,963 --> 01:32:50,673
We need to step away...

1462
01:32:52,635 --> 01:32:54,835
...run away...
(laughing)

1463
01:32:55,638 --> 01:32:57,638
...knowing that...

1464
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:00,736
along the way...

1465
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:03,409
there will be amazing...

1466
01:33:03,478 --> 01:33:06,008
and terrifying surprises

1467
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:07,921
at every turn.

1468
01:33:07,983 --> 01:33:13,093
And guys that make you suck
on beef jerky for a discount.

1469
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:17,930
But all of that doesn't matter,

1470
01:33:17,993 --> 01:33:21,433
because we're all just trying
to do the best we can

1471
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:23,496
with what we're given.

1472
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:27,265
And, Pastor Paul,
you have it wrong.

1473
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:31,765
It's not our responsibility
to suffer the consequences

1474
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,610
of our actions...

1475
01:33:34,677 --> 01:33:36,437
but...

1476
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:38,611
rather celebrate them!

1477
01:33:39,882 --> 01:33:41,982
(whistling)
- Whoo-hoo!!

1478
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,718
(music)

1479
01:33:49,925 --> 01:33:54,055
* We're all traveling
down this lonely road *

1480
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:59,073
* We're all tumbling
in the tides *

1481
01:34:00,502 --> 01:34:04,812
* But I am here
to simply let you know *

1482
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:09,243
* I'll be right by your side *

1483
01:34:11,513 --> 01:34:15,423
* We all hear
that voice inside our souls *

1484
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:20,091
* A wind that whispers
in the night *

1485
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:26,127
* Whatever lies
down this old winding road *

1486
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:31,274
* I'll be right by your side *

1487
01:34:32,735 --> 01:34:34,465
* Oh oh oh oh *

1488
01:34:34,536 --> 01:34:37,836
* Don't have to face
this world alone *

1489
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:40,006
* Oh oh oh *

1490
01:34:40,075 --> 01:34:43,205
* I'll be the place
that you call home *

1491
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,708
* Oh oh oh *

1492
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:49,620
* The pages turn
and years go by *

1493
01:34:50,552 --> 01:34:53,922
* And I'll be
right by your side *

1494
01:34:56,558 --> 01:35:00,428
* A hundred books
can't tell you what to do *

1495
01:35:02,097 --> 01:35:05,427
* A thousand songs
that still don't rhyme *

1496
01:35:07,402 --> 01:35:11,712
* Be yourself
and keep your heart true *

1497
01:35:11,774 --> 01:35:17,714
* I'll be right by your side *

1498
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:20,050
* Oh oh oh oh *

1499
01:35:20,115 --> 01:35:23,385
* Don't have to face
this world alone *

1500
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:25,351
* Oh oh oh *

1501
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:28,560
* I'll be the place
that you call home *

1502
01:35:28,623 --> 01:35:30,863
* Oh oh oh *

1503
01:35:30,926 --> 01:35:34,656
* The pages turn
and years go by *

1504
01:35:35,597 --> 01:35:40,167
* And I'll be
right by your side *

1505
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:46,983
* It doesn't matter where
we choose to plant our roots *

1506
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:51,012
* We'll always blossom
in each other's light *

1507
01:35:52,447 --> 01:35:56,887
* And from the shelter
of your open arms *

1508
01:35:56,952 --> 01:36:01,592
* You look into my eyes *

1509
01:36:01,656 --> 01:36:05,226
* And say oh oh oh oh *

1510
01:36:05,293 --> 01:36:08,603
* Don't have to face
this world alone *

1511
01:36:08,663 --> 01:36:10,933
* Oh oh oh *

1512
01:36:10,999 --> 01:36:13,599
* I'll be the place
that you call home *

1513
01:36:13,668 --> 01:36:16,398
* Oh oh oh *

1514
01:36:16,471 --> 01:36:20,211
* The pages turn
and years go by *

1515
01:36:21,009 --> 01:36:25,379
* And I'll be
right by your side *

1516
01:36:26,314 --> 01:36:31,054
* And I'll be
right by your side *

1517
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:37,530
(music fading)

1518
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:40,903
(funky music)
