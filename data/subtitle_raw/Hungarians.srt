00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,928
"If we don't count stupidity,
our past, our lives and our stomach,

3
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:39,392
Oh, then we're very pure indeed.
Let hope open up it's gates before us!"

00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,783
WINTER

5
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:35,602
Dear father!

6
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,825
- They're waiting for you in the pub!
- Nobody's waiting for me there!

7
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,337
But of course they are! Uncle Daniel just
knocked on the door a moment ago. There 
were others's with him!

8
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,800
Have gave it a thought?

9
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,623
The child is too small still. There's
nobody to look after him.

10
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:07,928
Your brother said he would... He did.

11
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,644
You never had such an opportunity before, 
Andras! Come with us!

12
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,564
Or you wish to live in a rented house
all your life?

13
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:23,036
You're the youngest and the strongest 
among us!

14
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,972
We'd feel much safer with you!

15
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,653
- I'd want to take the woman as well, 
if I'd decide to go! - You can!

16
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,963
Dani Kiss brings his one too, just like 
Janos Szabo and Elek Viktor!

17
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,067
Well, let's talk about it then!

18
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:42,652
Go! Tell your mother to come here!

19
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,719
Hear me out, Daniel!

20
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,995
My son would like to go with you too!

21
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,016
The air too damp there, Karoly,
and your son is...

22
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:54,985
He's recovered already. His 
lungs are fine.

23
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,244
Well, if that's how it is, all right then.

24
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,103
Whoever wishes to come, 
may come.

25
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,416
But we can't take everybody with us either!
There is a war going on.

26
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,282
The village cannot be left
without menfolks.

27
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,913
- There are lots of work here as well.
- I got that. 

28
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:12,874
But I can spare my son.

29
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,476
Are you certain that he's recovered?

30
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:17,635
Why would I lie to you?

31
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:28,931
I talked to the notary. He wants 
the list by tomorrow morning.

32
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:31,937
I write down everybody who applies.

33
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,106
They are making a contract
with everybody.

34
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,474
How much is the payment?

35
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,273
If they'll only pay half of what
they promise,

36
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:46,305
we'll still be all right.
We're going to be paid after performance.

37
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,623
Whoever works more, will get more. 
That's how it is.

38
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,927
- I went to the notary.
- I'm not going anywhere!

39
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:05,737
Goddamnit! I'm not going!

40
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:09,378
I'd rather just die here! But I'm not going!

41
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:14,993
You're just like your father! He lived his
entire life here, and he never even 
left the village!

42
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,394
What are you talking about my father?

43
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,968
My father went as far at the land 
of the Italians!

44
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:21,550
Stop yelling! You wake up the child!

45
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,450
If I said I won't go,

46
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,578
that means, I won't go! Goddamn it!

47
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:30,465
My father had stabbed an Italian
at Isonzo!

48
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,766
He had to! He was taken!

49
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:38,606
But following his own heart he
never went not even as far as Debrecen!

50
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:43,022
And they can also take you to the war
again, too!

51
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,806
Which is a another good reason for us to go!

52
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,310
But no... I'm not going!

53
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:56,262
Well, look! The Bandi Bacsko, the fool!

54
00:04:56,945 --> 00:05:01,419
What does he want? He's looking at you, 
Andras! Do you hear me?

55
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:09,748
Why is he looking? It seems he wants to
tell you something, but I wonder what?

56
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:15,890
Do you hear me? Don't go! Don't go away!

57
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,947
Don't go, Andras! You mustn't!

58
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:37,971
Where are you running, you? Are you 
trying to race with the train?

59
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,460
You hapless! He fell!

60
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:51,195
- I wonder what he wanted...
- I don't know.

61
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:55,763
I think I saw him crying. And fools
cannot cry at all, you know.

62
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,795
- How come?
- They just can't.

63
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:05,828
In Kallo, in the loony bin, I never 
saw not even one to cry.

64
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:08,907
Not once. 'Cos they don't 
have the brains for it!

65
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:13,453
Ah, Dani! Dani! By God, I can't
deal with it. Help me, Abris!

66
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:16,086
Abris! Hold the legs! Come on, now!

67
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,649
Why are you pushing me?

68
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:21,135
Stop that, Irma!

69
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,366
You be blessed by the Good All-mighty!
How many times I have to ask you 
to stop crying?

70
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,046
Let's say one Our Father!

71
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,286
We're not heading to the fair, Rozi!
Why are you sounding the bells?

72
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:54,612
If only we'd go to Pocs, at least!

73
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,325
I just want to pray to 

74
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:01,621
meet my mother alive still, 
when we return! 

75
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,629
This is not a funteral! We're not
going to die there!

76
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:08,988
Say your prayers silently! This is
nobody else's business!

77
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:42,710
German [too quiet]

78
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:47,615
German [too quiet]

79
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,471
- Do we have everything?
- Yes.

80
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:04,779
We can go.

81
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:35,176
Good day, folks! This gentleman
here, beside me is the Master!

82
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:38,055
You'll be working on his farm!

83
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:43,159
<i>(in German) Hello! How do you do?</i>

84
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:48,386
<i>(in German) Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!</i>

85
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,954
The Master kindly welcomes you.

86
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,757
Other Hungarians have worked here before
as well, but they returned home right 
before Christmas.

87
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,972
Only I stayed behind.

88
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,926
I'm called Brayner. Brayner.

89
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,605
Well, let's go then.

90
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:14,157
You can always come to me with 
whatever problems you've got.

91
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,390
Anton! Hey!

92
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:45,515
Well, please! You'll be living at this 
wing of the castle, upstairs.

93
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:48,891
Couples will be given their own rooms.

94
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:51,691
You can find the kitchen downstairs.

95
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:55,422
Everybody is allowed to cook for themselves 
there. And if you look where I'm pointing now,

96
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,651
there are some barracks beyond the trees.

97
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,602
It's got fences all over. Don't go there
if possible!

98
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:05,451
By the way, you'll be given an card, and you're
free to go wherever you want with that.

99
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,988
You're not restricted in your movements.

100
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:11,372
The only thing the Master asks you is 
not to inquire about the barrack-camp!

101
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,664
Nice and warm room!

102
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,371
What are you looking for?

103
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:35,549
- I want to talk to the Master!
- What do you want from him?

104
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:41,573
- I must talk to him!
- Come!

105
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:57,967
<i>(in German) Come in!</i>

106
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,534
<i>(in German) This Hungarian lady wants 
to talk to you.</i>

107
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:16,137
<i>(in German) Please.</i>

108
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,881
So, say it! What do 
you want from the Master?

109
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:26,810
Ask him, where is the church
here?

110
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:30,738
<i>(in German) She asks, where the next church is.</i>

111
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,082
<i>(in German) The church...</i>

112
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,585
There is no church here. 
This is a farm.

113
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:44,834
It was a pity to turn to the Master
with this. The church is in the town!

114
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:48,211
We'll go there sooner or later!
There was no need to disturb the 
Master over this!

115
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:11,610
Abris! I brought you some tea!

116
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:18,228
Don't tell this to the Master!
I'll be all right by tomorrow!

117
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:21,588
I just got weak. Otherwise
I'm fine!

118
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:51,555
- Do you know how to deal with horses?
- There is no need to know much about that!

119
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,451
But these are different horses
than the ones back home!

120
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:57,955
Horses are horses wherever 
they are!

121
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,875
I cleaned horses before,
although not too often,

122
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,004
but I want to do it, like...

123
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:32,019
And this? You're full of hay, you!

124
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,531
<i>(In German) Nah! What do you want from me?</i>

125
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:41,820
Why are you so jumpy? Why are you 
so jumpy? You fool!

126
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:50,735
- You must be Anton, right? You're Anton!
<i>- (in German) [unintelligible/drunk]</i>

129

<i>in German [unintelligible/drunk]</i>

131
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:37,855
I don't know what's this, but it seems
like palinka. Even though it's not.

132
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:44,287
It's sweet. It's better than nothing!

133
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:29,099
<i>(in German) Come, come.</i>

134
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:39,523
<i>- (in German) [unintelligible/drunk]</i>
- Dear God, Anton!

135
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:43,139
Your mouth must be rotting away,
'cos your breath really stinks!

136
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:47,011
<i>(in German) Come, come.</i>

137
00:17:55,978 --> 00:18:00,539
<i>(in German) Look here! Come on...</i>

138
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,596
<i>(in German) Come...</i>

139
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,246
Where are you hurrying, Fabian?

140
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:42,382
You're faster on foot than 
others on horseback!

141
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:45,114
One must hurry if he really wants
to get there!

142
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:53,138
That's the spirit!

143
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,370
But there is no need to do 
everything in one day, Fabian!

144
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,014
That long one, the Szabo!

145
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:03,510
He carries up two bags of potatoes
from the cellar, and then complains
that his back hurts! 

146
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,414
There is no need to exert yourselves yet!

147
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,350
The time has not come for that yet!
Only when the summer comes!

148
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:13,511
The fall! That's when! Then you'll
have a lot to do!

149
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,025
That's when most of the work is!
That's right! 

150
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,346
The Master will be glad!

151
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,386
I'd love to smoke some Hungarian
tobacco, Fabian!

152
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,992
If only you'd accept mine 
in exchange!

153
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:42,128
Careful with your tobacco, Fabian!
Not always can we get that!

154
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,576
- No?
- Well, there is war going on, if you wouldn't know!

155
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:53,864
Mr. Brayner!

156
00:19:57,303 --> 00:19:59,255
There are only flatlands in this
area?

157
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,335
Not a single living soul comes
all day long!

158
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:07,575
Tell me, Fabian! Do you know who
are fighting these days?

159
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,247
- I know. - Well, who?
- The folks.

160
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:18,583
Folks? What folks?

161
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:24,122
Have you heard about 
the name of Hitler yet?

162
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:28,442
Hitler. Hitler Adolf.

163
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,458
I think I might have hear it
before.

164
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,690
And you, Fabian, what have
you heard about him?

165
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:40,866
With all due respect, but I don't
read no newspapers.

166
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,340
Hitler is a military man!

167
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:55,557
That right! A military man!

168
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,136
A Chief-commander!

169
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,241
What's wrong with this one?

170
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:14,840
Mr. Brayner! Can I ask you something?

171
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,073
Go ahead.

172
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,041
Who are there in the neighbourhood?
There, in the barracks,

173
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,170
which is surrounded.

174
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,771
French POWs.

175
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,052
- I'd like to have a look at them, if I may.
- Why would you want to do that?

176
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,346
What's wrong with them?

177
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,477
You see, Fabian! Your wife understands
reason much better than you do!

178
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,342
What's to point looking at them?

179
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:46,493
POWs? POWs. I don't look at things
I have absolutely no business with!

180
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,557
Such people are capable of everything!

181
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,829
Why did you came up with those 
prisoners?

182
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,517
How could you ask anything at all
from such a man?

183
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:06,366
He is a Hungarian. He speaks 
Hungarian.

184
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,453
He worked here last year, and 
then he stayed around.

185
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:16,741
He is a Hungarian.

186
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:03,751
Can you hear this, Ilonka? Airplanes!

187
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:15,383
SPRING

188
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:14,679
But who're playing on the fiddles 
and trumpets?

189
00:25:16,694 --> 00:25:18,934
And how do they know what
to play?

190
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,622
They must be playing from paper,
that's for sure!

191
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,720
That must be very hard!

192
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:34,441
But almost like a miracle!

193
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:37,688
Almost like... like a miracle!

194
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,048
A letter came from back home again!

195
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:43,606
The money arrived to the post 
for second time as well.

196
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,589
But my brother says only I can
collect it!

197
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,247
- Once I return home.
- They wrote the same to us, too!

198
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:55,270
Our fortunes are growing! That's 
what my aunt wrote to us!

199
00:25:56,486 --> 00:26:00,727
By the time Christmas arrives again,
you'll have so much money you won't 
even know what to do with it!

200
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:05,390
Ahaha! That's our smallest problem!
Money is very easy to spend!

201
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,744
That's right! Very easy!

202
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,404
Especially is somebody likes 
to go the pub!

203
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:20,677
<i>(in German) Bloody idiot. I told you a thousand times...</i>

204
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,038
<i>(in German) What are you doing down there with the critters.</i>

205
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,122
<i>(in German) I'll whack you good you fool.</i>

206
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:10,034
Back home, in my childhood,

207
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:12,714
I used to go to school barefoot
as early as March!

208
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:18,289
But here, the ground is still cold 
and wet!

209
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:23,704
And there are no birds either!
They should have at least skylarks!

210
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:28,094
Back home, in the old days, one could
always find skylarks at least, if nothing else!

211
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:32,630
Skylarks? Skylarks!

212
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:38,126
Skylarks!

213
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:48,878
<i>(in German) ...on.</i>

214
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:57,322
<i>(in German) Don't linger! Go on.</i>

215
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,446
<i>(in German) The other side, forward march!</i>

216
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,610
<i>(in German) Sergeant, come over here.</i>

217
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:32,823
<i>(in German) Now come with me.</i>

218
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:39,912
<i>(in German) Come on now.</i>

219
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:41,458
<i>(in German) Halt!</i>

220
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:58,282
Polish

221
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:02,446
Polish

222
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,761
<i>- (in German) You are welcome...
- Back off.</i>

223
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,873
<i>(in German) 16 women into the last room.</i>

224
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,609
Polish

225
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:48,457
<i>(in German) 24 into this one.</i>

226
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:50,722
Polish

227
00:29:50,757 --> 00:29:52,994
<i>(in German) and the rest into the one back there.</i>

228
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:57,017
Polish. 
<i>- (in German) Now go on!</i>

229
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,762
Polish

230
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:13,353
For the children! Kind!

231
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,481
Bring this one back!

232
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,314
Bring it back! This one!

233
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,658
Polish

234
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,356
Polish

235
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:40,044
<i>(in German) Here in this room. Into there.</i>

236
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:45,731
Polish

237
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,646
Polish

238
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:24,188
Andras!

239
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,315
Polack cigarettes!

240
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,107
Filled with tasty tobacco for gentlemen!

241
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:45,580
I'm coming soon!

242
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,241
They shot somebody! It must have been 
a Frenchman!

243
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:17,569
Or a Polack! He probably tried to escape.

244
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:22,690
Open the window, Andras! Maybe we
can see something!

245
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:44,737
<i>There is no need for you in here today!</i>

246
00:32:44,772 --> 00:32:46,762
This is what Brayner told me. Word-by-word!

247
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:52,089
But why? And he also sent the woman 
to work on the beet-field!

248
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:56,098
- Why do you think he did that?
- How would I know?

249
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,780
You hear me, Dani? Have you 
seen the carter this morning?

250
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,172
- No. 
- That's just it. 'cos me neither!

251
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,171
Something is not OK here!

252
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:21,572
Come on, Lisie! Let's keep on! 

253
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:25,021
Nobody seen him!

254
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:30,436
Who the heck understands this? 
God only knows where he might be!

255
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,305
Last evening, when they were shooting!
I wonder if it was...

256
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,921
We can't know that for sure!
And stop talking now!

257
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:46,081
Stop talking about that now!
Keep quiet!

258
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:50,579
God bless, folks!

259
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:55,898
You're going well! If goes on like this,
the harvest will be much better 
than last year.

260
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,252
And everything goes well, the women
will finish working on the root-field, too!

261
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:12,731
The Master noticed that you are 
interested in music, Abris!

262
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,499
And said you can go in to his room
if you want to listen to some music.

263
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:19,956
- You just have to tell me before that!
- Thank you very much.

264
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,236
We haven't seen the carter today, Mr. Brayner!

265
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:30,292
And he is usually here by now.

266
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:33,091
- Bringing us some water...
- There is no need to continue, Fabian!

267
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:38,577
I wouldn't ask such questions if I were you!

268
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:45,617
Not from me, nor anybody else! I wouldn't
even mention the carter's name actually!

269
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,778
I suppose you didn't come here 
only to be sent home!

270
00:34:57,784 --> 00:35:00,318
Listen to me, Brayner! How dare you?
If I would grab you...

271
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:01,742
- No! No!
- Andras!

272
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:03,293
- Why do you care so much about the carter?
- Sit down!

273
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:04,751
Care or not care!

274
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:07,102
It's not about that! But he should
talk to us with respect!

275
00:35:10,294 --> 00:35:11,382
Mr. Brayner!

276
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:15,409
We're among each other.
And you just started to threaten.

277
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,494
We asked you about the carter 
respectfully.

278
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,902
And you can only threaten as an answer?

279
00:35:21,774 --> 00:35:23,525
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention.

280
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:30,126
But you came here to work.
Not for sightseeing!

281
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,390
You're paid good money for 
your work!

282
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:34,595
So, concentrate on that, and on nothing else!

283
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,740
And for your own sake, it's better if you
just close your eyes even now!

284
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,347
Good Lord!

285
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:46,667
<i>(in German) Deal with the 2 back there.</i>

286
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:03,773

Polish

292
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:52,263
Dear God! He won't live to 
see the morning!

293
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:57,295
I'll be back soon!

294
00:38:58,428 --> 00:39:01,722
Ilona! Ilona!

00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,972
Polish

Come, quickly! 
<i>(in German) Come!</i>

You must! You must!

00:40:01,445 --> 00:40:04,350
He's dying! Dying!

Polish

305
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,647
That's it! This will bring 
down the fever!

306
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,678
It will help, you'll see!

307
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:52,754
I've a son like you, too!

308
00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:55,157
I've two...

00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:58,581
- Two? - I've!

Polish

311
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:10,061
How could you come up with that?

312
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:13,550
- No!
- Polish

313
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:16,718
- Polish
- You want to give that to me?

314
00:41:16,753 --> 00:41:20,550
- Polish
- You need it much better!

315
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:23,117
- Polish
- I've one upstairs!

316
00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:26,487

- You need it, too!

- Well, thank you. Thank you.

00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:38,158
- Polish
- Folks! Here is the...

320
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:40,549
- Polish
- That's enough!

321
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:43,509
- Enough while we're here!
- Polish

322
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,226
They made the Polack women
pack their things!

323
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:50,108
They are taking them away!

324
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:54,014
It's Brayner and two 
military trucks!

325
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:58,061
The soil too wet.

326
00:41:58,454 --> 00:42:00,837
There'll be no hoeing here,
not even in the afternoon!

327
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:02,756
There is water between the lines still!

328
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:06,221
Well, then there's no point waiting here,
let's go back to the Farm!

329
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,811
- What's with the boy?
- It seems like he's covering up.

330
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:12,883
He said he can come with tomorrow.

331
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:20,626
They tired. They were all up last night
during that war in the sky!

332
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,803
Would you believe that? Water!

333
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,675
A bit of Palinka would turn into
blood in me now!

334
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:05,200
Not even I would spit it out this time!

335
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,872
Palinka is a medicine!

336
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:11,018
It was the carter who gave us Palinka
the last time, on the very first day!

337
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:14,434
- Do you remember, Dani?
- Uhum! Very much!

338
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,776
I very much remember it, because
that was the last time as well!

339
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:21,688
I wonder where the carter is now?

340
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,876
That poor fool smells very bad
by now!

341
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:32,951
- What kinda bird is this?
- Some kinda crow.

342
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:36,383
First time I see a bird ever since
I got here.

343
00:43:37,303 --> 00:43:38,990
There are not even skylarks here.

344
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:44,890
So! Let's some some gentlemen's
cigarettes!

345
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:49,141
What kind of cigarettes? Oooh! There's 
no point wasting it on us!

346
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:54,268
This really is gentlemen's cigarettes!

347
00:43:57,436 --> 00:43:59,875
This cigarette refreshes me!

348
00:44:02,035 --> 00:44:05,812
Me too. I feel like something
is stirring in me!

349
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:09,308
I feel like I could do 
a thing-or-two!

350
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:13,523
- Like what?
- Well, for example, if...

351
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:17,779
no better things show up, I'd wrestle with you,
and push you to the ground!

352
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:20,574
- You really feel like you would?
- Right!

353
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,142
Then you just wait until I'll feel like it too!

354
00:44:26,855 --> 00:44:28,254
You!

355
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:34,655
'this good! Like a horn!

356
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:37,552
Or like an elder-whistle!

357
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,159
- You, Elek!
- What?

358
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:43,231
- Can you blow that in tune with me?
- How on Earth could I not?

359
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,450
Well, then play with me that...

360
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:52,657
<i>This roundshaped sky when it goes dark,
it lights up!</i>

361
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:59,053
<i>A little bench in front of our house,
don't sit on it!</i>

362
00:44:59,785 --> 00:45:05,448
<i>Or if you sit on it, be careful
not to fall!</i>

363
00:45:05,854 --> 00:45:11,612
<i>You used to be my lover, but 
I don't need you anymore!</i>

364
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:15,708
Dani has a good voice still!

365
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:17,884
That's true. That he has!

366
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:26,923
- So far it was good... This day, I mean.
- Good-good. That's right.

367
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:30,167
So far it was the best among them all!

368
00:45:40,598 --> 00:45:45,216
The Master and Brayner are not at home.
It seems like they'll only be back in the evening.

369
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,637
Abris had a bad dream!

370
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:50,756
Tell us about it, it will relieve you!

371
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,020
I dreamt about colours. Many colours!

372
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:06,352
Red, blue... and pure white as snow.

373
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:07,756
What was white?

374
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:14,512
Only the ending was white! At the end...

375
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:23,696
We're listening to you from 
the beginning till the end.

376
00:46:31,064 --> 00:46:33,176
It started with me getting lost,

377
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:36,779
at first we were all inside,

378
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,195
but then all of a sudden, I was 
left alone in a big forest.

379
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,019
And this forest seemed to have
neither a beginning nor an end.

380
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:57,650
I was just wandering around in it.

381
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:01,291
I was wandering in it for days,

382
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:08,499
and the interesting part was that
I never seemed to get tired.

383
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:11,439
My legs were light.

384
00:47:14,846 --> 00:47:20,608
When I looked up on the sky, the
Sun was always right above my head.

385
00:47:22,431 --> 00:47:25,687
And because of that everything
seemed much whiter.

386
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:31,566
And then there was that great
silence!

387
00:47:33,135 --> 00:47:37,647
Whenever I yelled, my voice reverberated
from the distance!

388
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:43,134
Magyars! Magyars!

389
00:47:44,006 --> 00:47:45,953
Where are you?

390
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:51,201
I'm looking for the Magyars!

391
00:47:53,785 --> 00:47:56,033
Magyars! Answer me!

392
00:47:57,135 --> 00:48:01,175
Magyars! Why don't you answer me?

393
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:05,295
Hallo!

394
00:48:07,847 --> 00:48:09,308
Magyars!

395
00:48:39,347 --> 00:48:41,195
I'm looking for the Magyars, uncle!

396
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:50,387
You're at the right place then, son.
'Cos I'm the very last one of them.

397
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:53,182
The last Magyar.

398
00:48:56,677 --> 00:49:02,669
Look at me carefully! You won't find 
another Magyar in the world anymore, but me.

399
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:08,465
There are endless waters beyond the forest.
You won't find any Magyars there either!

400
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:14,682
You're lying! This is not true! After all
I'm a Magyar, too!

401
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:20,185
There's got to be more Magyars still!
Of course there are!

402
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:23,369
Like, Kisdebi, and Andras Fabian!

403
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,321
And Daniel Gaspar!

404
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,137
Magyars! Where are you, Magyars?

405
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:35,945
Magyars! Where are you?

406
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,960
Magyars!

407
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:47,056
The Master's son might return home 
on a leave from the army.

408
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:53,073
This is his room. It's been closed
for years.

409
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:56,369
So, this what you are supposed to
clean up.

410
00:50:13,082 --> 00:50:15,281
The Master would like to offer 
you some beer.

411
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:21,977
Come! We can drink some good beer now!

412
00:50:22,273 --> 00:50:23,553
That doesn't sound bad!

413
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:48,385
- The Master says, 'to your health!'
- To all of us!

414
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,902
To our health!

415
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:03,306
German

416
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:25,278
German

417
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,213
The Master says, in his son's name as well.

418
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,277
German

419
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:45,045
You did a very nice, very good work
today, folks.

420
00:51:45,813 --> 00:51:47,692
Tell it to the women as well.

421
00:51:48,796 --> 00:51:51,477
Except that all this work was
in vain already.

422
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:54,830
Because the Master's son got lost.

423
00:51:56,227 --> 00:51:58,187
I was already told about it 
in town.

424
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:01,954
- But he can still return.
- Look, Mr. Fabian!

425
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,994
Whenever somebody gets lost in war,
he never returns home.

426
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:07,891
And the Master's son got lost in Russia.

427
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:12,098
I'll count in your day as usual.
You did a good job.

428
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:14,492
I'll count it as if you were
hoeing.

429
00:52:14,527 --> 00:52:16,252
- Thank you, Mr. Brayner!
- Thank you very much.

430
00:52:17,399 --> 00:52:17,788
- Have a good rest!
- Good night!

431
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,513
Could you help me, Mr. Brayner?

432
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:43,442
- In what?
- I'd like to buy a bicycle.

433
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:48,049
For my brother. We left the kid
with him. He looks after him.

434
00:52:49,196 --> 00:52:53,163
I'd like to send him a steel-framed
bicycle.

435
00:52:53,794 --> 00:52:56,931
We're going to town with the Master 
next week. Whoever feels like may 
come with us.

436
00:52:57,282 --> 00:52:59,354
You can buy it then!

437
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:04,106
But why haven't you got married?

438
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,266
- 'Cos I didn't feel like...
- Why?

439
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:12,081
Poor folks should never get
married!

440
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:18,979
Because when poverty grabs its own hand,
it gives way to a much greater poverty!

441
00:53:19,914 --> 00:53:22,345
But then are we just supposed to kick
the bucket, only because we're poor?

442
00:53:25,546 --> 00:53:27,209
I thought about this myself, too.

443
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:33,488
And if I wouldn't be such a curious man by 
nature, surely I'd be smelling the flowers
from down below by now!

444
00:53:34,488 --> 00:53:36,008
What are you curious about?

445
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,673
Myself. And the world around me.

446
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:47,904
I always wonder about that even though
the days seem to be the same,

447
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:51,288
people's lives are different every day.

448
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:56,300
What's the reason behind that?
What kind of machinery is hidden in humans?

449
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,637
When two people start talking 
to each other,

450
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:03,432
they can tell everything about themselves,
but still!

451
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,975
None of them will actually find out 
what's the other's biggest problem!

452
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,840
There is a chasm so great between 
people

453
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,206
like the distance between 
heaven and earth.

454
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,967
Have you heard that we're 
going to Paris next week?

455
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:41,335
To Paris? To the sea, perhaps?

456
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:45,815
There as well! Brayner told me 
last time he came in here!

457
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:48,175
Just before they took away 
the Polack women.

458
00:54:48,983 --> 00:54:51,246
And he said that whoever wants
might come with us!

459
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:57,344
- Well, I wouldn't mind to go!
- Me neither! If only I'd get better by then!

460
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,455
Brayner said we could even 
go to a church there!

461
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,279
I'd even do my confessions 
if that's possible!

462
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:09,816
Of course, you want to do your confessions.

463
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:12,573
After all the priests speak Hungarian
around here!

464
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:16,013
You too smart, Aunt Zsofi!

465
00:55:16,048 --> 00:55:19,285
But if you'd really be that smart, you 
should know that one cannot live without God!

466
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:21,274
That's for sure!

467
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:23,905
But if you wish to do your confessions, 

468
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,617
you must talk to Brayner as well, no doubt!
And make sure you thoroughly discuss your sins
with him! 

469
00:55:28,823 --> 00:55:30,349
Otherwise the priest might misunderstand!

470
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:36,004
Careful, Aunt Zsofi! One is not 
supposed to make jokes about God!

471
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:43,812
Stop! Stop, will you!

472
00:55:48,676 --> 00:55:51,533
- Mr. Brayner! It's Sunday, 
Goddamn you! - Let him!

473
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:54,205
So what? If it's Sunday, it's Sunday!

474
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,120
Is that why you had to stop the truck?

475
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:58,112
Because I can't buy anything today!
All the shops are closed!

476
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:01,215
I told you! I want a bicycle!
They're expecting it back home! 
I want that bicycle!

477
00:56:01,847 --> 00:56:04,823
You be careful, because if there will be none,
God have mercy on you! You hear me?

478
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:07,735
What do you want, man? We'll still be 
in town tomorrow morning!

479
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:10,260
Then you can buy as many bicycles as you wish!

480
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,941
Whoever doesn't want to come, tell me now!
I can still take'em back!

481
00:56:37,124 --> 00:56:38,660
Look, Uncle Daniel!

482
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:43,885
This castle has so many towers,
that I haven't seen this many, not even
on churches!

483
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:49,388
- This must be a rich country!
- Right! A rich one!

484
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,499
It seems like one!

485
00:57:00,428 --> 00:57:01,433
German

486
00:57:05,992 --> 00:57:07,490
German

487
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:11,993
German

488
00:57:12,937 --> 00:57:15,209
German

489
00:57:15,563 --> 00:57:16,722
German

490
00:57:23,604 --> 00:57:26,165
- German
- Stand up!

491
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:44,954
German

492
00:58:51,815 --> 00:58:53,543
Holy Virgin Mary!

493
00:58:54,382 --> 00:58:56,359
Holy Mother of our Lord, Jesus.

494
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,223
Guardian Angel of the Hungarians!

495
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:03,103
We pray to you, help us!

496
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,368
Help us to get back home safely from here!

497
00:59:09,423 --> 00:59:14,327
Help me to be able to meet my mother still
when I arrive back home! Help me!

498
00:59:14,863 --> 00:59:20,247
Grant me strength to be able to work
and to put an end to our poverty!

499
00:59:21,527 --> 00:59:23,647
Help us, Virgin Mary!

500
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:29,903
My spine shivers! Strength deserts my arms.

501
00:59:31,662 --> 00:59:36,774
But give me endurance to be able
to raise up my little children.

502
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:40,917
Help us, Virgin Mary!

503
00:59:42,157 --> 00:59:46,629
I'll express my gratitude to the Maria
in Pocs when I return home!

504
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:50,430
Help me until then, Virgin Mary!

505
00:59:51,685 --> 00:59:55,142
Guardian Angel of the Hungarians!
Help us, my Lord!

506
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:56,875
Great God!

507
00:59:57,938 --> 00:59:59,915
Help me to be able to thank

508
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,973
the graceful support of the Holy Virgin!

509
01:00:03,259 --> 01:00:08,347
And your mercy, for keeping 
us in good health!

510
01:00:08,382 --> 01:00:10,627
And for preserving our strength!

511
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,136
And helping us raise our children!

512
01:00:14,183 --> 01:00:19,532
To your Glory! May it be so, My lord!

513
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:28,052
The river! There's the river!

514
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:30,541
- Aha!
- Good Lord! My wife!

515
01:00:30,617 --> 01:00:32,792
Rozika! Rozika!

516
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:36,119
Dani! To the tree!

517
01:00:44,169 --> 01:00:46,537
Her heart! Her heart must be
massaged!

518
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:03,641
Such a heat came over me.
But I already feel much better.

519
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:13,409
- Where is the Master, Mr. Brayner?
- He left. He's got some business elsewhere.

520
01:01:13,444 --> 01:01:14,973
We'll only meet up with him in the morning.

521
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:18,582
I need to leave now as well.
I got to take care of something.

522
01:01:20,437 --> 01:01:22,093
Get back on the car!

523
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:28,700
I wouldn't mind if you'd hurry 
up a bit!

524
01:01:29,388 --> 01:01:32,382
I'll take you to the river.
You can wait for me there.

525
01:01:33,492 --> 01:01:36,740
But don't wander off from there,
because then we won't be able 
to find each other!

526
01:01:36,775 --> 01:01:40,956
Mr. Brayner! Where are we 
going to sleep?

527
01:01:41,439 --> 01:01:43,904
On the truck! There is 
enough space!

528
01:01:46,872 --> 01:01:51,239
That much is true. There is
enough space for us there.

529
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,536
Just like the river Tisza! 
What river is this, I wonder?

530
01:02:28,571 --> 01:02:32,312
- It's called Seine.
- How do you know that?

531
01:02:32,536 --> 01:02:34,720
From school. We learned about this.

532
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:38,666
Main in Frankfurt, Rhine in Strassbourg,
and Seine in Paris.

533
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,337
It's hard to forget that!

534
01:02:50,524 --> 01:02:52,324
Such valiant soldiers!

535
01:02:52,796 --> 01:02:55,316
They are marching as if some 
machinery is moving their legs!

536
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:59,955
You just don't envy them so much! 
You can still be a soldier again!

537
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:24,748
The Master is a good man, after all!

538
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:27,739
He took us to Paris, to the 
Church of Our Lady!

539
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:33,091
And now, to the beach! Nobody else
would have done that!

540
01:03:34,066 --> 01:03:35,623
Your face is on fire, boy!

541
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:43,134
- You've got the fever!
- Nothing's wrong with me! I feel just fine!

542
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:52,431
It was a pity to come here! It will soon 
be raining!

543
01:03:52,466 --> 01:03:54,255
Let's not despair now, 
that we're here!

544
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,437
Let's rejoice that we're here!

545
01:04:10,005 --> 01:04:12,365
Ilonka! Zsofi! Rozi! Irma! Come!

546
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:15,093
You won't see something like this
ever again!

547
01:04:15,926 --> 01:04:19,572
Water without end! You've never
seen such a thing before! Come!

548
01:04:31,587 --> 01:04:33,691
If the weather would be better,
we could even have a swim!

549
01:04:34,405 --> 01:04:36,638
Well, that's just the kind of thing
we're missing...

550
01:04:48,637 --> 01:04:50,271
What are you doing, Abri?

551
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:53,623
Stop there, will you!

552
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,606
- You're not my father to give orders to me!
- You're sick, you unfortunate!

553
01:05:09,918 --> 01:05:11,296
I am not an unfortunate!

554
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:13,170
Just because I'm younger than you,

555
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,687
I'm not an unfortunate at all!

556
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,605
Daniel!

557
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:49,863
Here, put it on! This water 
would make you sick!

558
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:54,111
Daniel is right! You mustn't 
go into the water in this cold!

559
01:06:00,598 --> 01:06:02,159
Well, it's raining already!

560
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,343
There is some kind of house there!
Shouldn't we go there?

561
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,995
Of course, we should! Everybody
go up there!

562
01:06:11,747 --> 01:06:13,691
I'll bring up the truck!

563
01:06:22,076 --> 01:06:23,324
Come!

564
01:06:32,747 --> 01:06:33,835
Nobody must go in!

565
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:36,669
- What? Is there something wrong?
- Nothing wrong, but there is no need
to go in!

566
01:06:36,704 --> 01:06:37,908
Why can't we go in there?

567
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,503
Hell knows!

568
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:42,783
What is it? Is the door closed?

569
01:06:43,783 --> 01:06:46,968
- Why don't you enter, Daniel?
- With all you respect, there is somebody in there.

570
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:49,136
German

571
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:51,339
Who is that who stops us from 
getting in?

572
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:03,966
It seems like he won't be able 
to harm us anymore!

573
01:07:04,885 --> 01:07:07,966
Don't kid with me, please! If you're
seeing a dead man, just say it!

574
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:12,278
- Anything can happen in war!
- Well, this one is certainly dead.

575
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:18,855
He is just sitting by the window. One 
would think he's just asleep.

576
01:07:20,223 --> 01:07:24,648
But no. This one is not asleep. 
This one is dead for sure!

577
01:07:24,683 --> 01:07:25,823
God Allmighty!

578
01:07:27,352 --> 01:07:29,643
What are we waiting for? 
Let's go in, until it stops!

579
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:32,755
Don't! You, godless! Next to 
a dead man?

580
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:35,355
- Ah! Ah! Ah!
- Dear God! The bicycle!

581
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:37,625
Let's go back to the truck!

582
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:41,116
Brings some branches! And a tilt!
Hide underneath!

583
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,707
Give me the end of the tilt, Andras!

584
01:07:44,307 --> 01:07:46,019
Hide underneath, quickly!

585
01:07:54,710 --> 01:08:00,541
German

586
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:06,077
What does it mean, I wonder? 
Surely some kind of prayer.

587
01:08:11,862 --> 01:08:13,965
The wrapping on it is 
soaking wet.

588
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:39,095
Which sea was that?

589
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:48,313
I've been thinking about that too.

590
01:08:50,217 --> 01:08:53,162
It must have been the icy Northern Sea!

591
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:57,298
- It could only be that!
- What? There was no ice there at all!

592
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,228
So what? A sea is a sea!
Let's sleep!

593
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:14,949
A steel-framed bicycle! By God, 
I haven't even heard of such a thing!

594
01:09:15,892 --> 01:09:17,597
Where did you get the idea from?

595
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:29,551
We're under a curse! The entire village!

596
01:09:30,271 --> 01:09:33,215
Because it was built over a graveyard!

597
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:37,756
Do you hear the bells?

598
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,420
Magyars rest here all around!

599
01:09:44,364 --> 01:09:47,691
And His Lordship, the Baron expects you
to drive fast and don't just stand there!

600
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:50,868
Do you hear me? Balint Fabian!

601
01:09:51,245 --> 01:09:53,239
- Do you understand, or not?
- Yes, Sir, I do understand!

602
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:57,969
Let's move it, then! These 
are all Lenin-boys here!

603
01:09:58,105 --> 01:10:00,295
Drive so fast that'd spit out
their own guts!

604
01:10:01,256 --> 01:10:02,248
Go!

605
01:10:09,795 --> 01:10:12,011
I knew them since their childhood.

606
01:10:12,956 --> 01:10:16,556
If this is what they deserve 
then what do I deserve, I wonder?

607
01:10:18,372 --> 01:10:22,676
I had to kill people during the war,

608
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,668
people I didn't even know.

609
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:31,091
Who never hurt neither me,
nor my family.

610
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:35,604
When the sergeant gave 
this to me, he said,

611
01:10:36,844 --> 01:10:39,084
Nothing can stop this.

612
01:10:39,274 --> 01:10:42,527
It pierces through even the bones.
That's what he said.

613
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:45,886
That Italian comes to my mind
quite often these days.

614
01:10:47,919 --> 01:10:52,311
I can still feel the warmth of his blood
between my fingers.

615
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:57,695
It was my face he carried with him
into death.

616
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:02,343
My face was the last one 
he could ever see in life.

617
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:07,671
It wasn't his children's or his wife's.

618
01:11:09,663 --> 01:11:10,746
But mine.

619
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:14,114
- What's your father, Fabian?
- With all due respect, a farmer.

620
01:11:15,034 --> 01:11:16,254
But he wasn't always that.

621
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:19,662
He used to be the Parade carter
of his Lordship, Baron Ugry

622
01:11:19,697 --> 01:11:22,790
- back in '19.
- There is a big problem, Fabian!

623
01:11:23,627 --> 01:11:24,956
Your father died, my son!

624
01:11:25,788 --> 01:11:27,820
He hanged himself on the
bellrope. 

625
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,964
You've got a five-days leave.
Five days from now

626
01:11:31,999 --> 01:11:34,661
you report back to us saying
that you respectfully buried your father!

627
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:36,889
- Is that understood?
- Yes Sir! Understood! With all due respect!

628
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:55,265
Here rests Balint Fabian,
Aged 43 years.

629
01:11:55,365 --> 01:11:58,265
He lived in happy marriage with Anna
Szabo for 27 years. He died in 1922.
Rest in Peace.

630
01:12:02,983 --> 01:12:06,718
AUTUMN

631
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:37,945
Move aside! I'll pick your line too!

632
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:39,846
French

633
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:44,431
I said, move aside! Leave these two 
lines for me!

634
01:12:44,476 --> 01:12:47,451
French

635
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,899
Look at that frenchman! He must 
be some gentleman of sort.

636
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:06,185
He's got long, slender fingers.

637
01:13:31,421 --> 01:13:32,862
Save your strength, Ilonka!

638
01:13:32,897 --> 01:13:35,257
- A long day is ahead of us!
- That's just right! But if he hurry up today,

639
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,998
we can make as much money in one day,
than at other times in a week!

640
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:42,492
Brayner said he'll calculate according to the 
number of the bins! He did say that!

641
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:19,666
They're not given any food!

642
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:23,781
Well, not much. They say

643
01:14:23,816 --> 01:14:26,381
that at the next farm the Russians are 
only given food once every day.

644
01:14:26,726 --> 01:14:28,085
Raw potatoes.

645
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:31,493
- Only once? - Only once. Brayner
told me.

646
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,901
God curse them al!

647
01:14:37,484 --> 01:14:39,141
Grab the bacon, Ilonka!

648
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:16,276
Bacon and potatoes.
I brought them for you.

649
01:15:17,853 --> 01:15:19,460
- Eat it
- Mercy.

650
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:21,931
French

651
01:15:56,211 --> 01:15:58,843
How are they supposed to work like that?
Hungry?

652
01:16:00,147 --> 01:16:01,924
They are given food in the morning 
and in the evening.

653
01:16:02,995 --> 01:16:05,964
Nowhere else in this country are 
prisoners kept so well as here.

654
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:09,420
And all that because of the Master.
You can believe me.

655
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,241
By the way, that thin-faced frenchman
told me

656
01:16:14,276 --> 01:16:17,641
that he has never seen a women work
as hard as you do, Mrs. Fabian!

657
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:24,081
Why is a cross hanging in his neck?

658
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:26,418
Is he that religious perhaps?

659
01:16:27,513 --> 01:16:33,074
Quite some. That frenchman is a priest.
??? Jean-Pierre Derion ???

660
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,529
- That's his name.
- A priest?

661
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:42,803
- How could they do this to a priest?
- Dear God! Even a priest?

662
01:16:51,146 --> 01:16:56,002
Gaspar! The Master is looking for
Abris Kontor!

663
01:17:00,419 --> 01:17:02,435
It was me, who told him to stay at home.

664
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:08,816
He hardly slept anything last night. He 
had a fever. And a bad cough.

665
01:17:19,558 --> 01:17:22,854
German

666
01:17:39,606 --> 01:17:41,885
The kid very much looks like 
the Master's son.

667
01:17:43,429 --> 01:17:46,885
He had a similar child-face. Nobody
wanted to believe that he's a doctor.

668
01:17:48,565 --> 01:17:50,917
By now even the Master knows
that he disappeared.

669
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:54,101
He was notified.

670
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,668
Duck! Into the ditch!

671
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:27,529
German

672
01:19:30,841 --> 01:19:35,347
German

673
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:40,987
- What is he saying?
- Well, that it's over.

674
01:19:41,022 --> 01:19:43,531
- What is?
- Everything.

675
01:19:45,316 --> 01:19:49,939
The war, he himself, the Germans. 
So, it's all over.

676
01:19:52,818 --> 01:19:55,713
Well, yes. If they wouldn't have 
teamed up with the Hungarians,

677
01:19:56,226 --> 01:19:57,808
they wouldn't get defeated now.

678
01:19:57,843 --> 01:20:01,412
- How come?
- Because the nations just don't seem 
to learn it for once and for all

679
01:20:01,447 --> 01:20:04,414
that it doesn't worth to befriend
the Hungarians.

680
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:09,508
After all, when did the Hungarians 
ever win? In which battle? Where?

681
01:20:13,228 --> 01:20:17,012
The Hungarians never won anywhere.
Unless,

682
01:20:17,588 --> 01:20:19,933
back in the days of our forefather, Chief Arpad.

683
01:20:20,603 --> 01:20:23,499
What? If the Germans lose the war,

684
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:27,580
- it will be because of the Hungarians?
- I didn't say that.

685
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,076
I only said that whoever befriended
the Hungarians in the past,

686
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,124
was always squashed.

687
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:40,501
I mean, always. Just remember back.

688
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:46,180
Always! Alongside the Hungarians.

689
01:20:59,108 --> 01:21:01,796
German

690
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,537
30, 35, 40, 45,

691
01:21:09,572 --> 01:21:11,954
50, 55, 59.

692
01:21:12,922 --> 01:21:15,652
Today's results are as follows:
The Kiss - 54,

693
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:19,045
the Fabians - 70, the Tars - 47,
the Szabos - 59 bins.

694
01:21:20,604 --> 01:21:23,125
How did you say, Mr. Brayner, 
how many bins for me and my husband?

695
01:21:23,513 --> 01:21:24,400
70. 

696
01:21:27,206 --> 01:21:30,572
Well, I beg your pardon! Are you sure
you counted them right?

697
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:33,259
How dare you accuse me of 
such thing?

698
01:21:34,434 --> 01:21:37,477
Who are you? You cannot even count till two
and you dare to question me?

699
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:39,658
I'm the farm manager, if you forgot 
about that! 

700
01:21:40,673 --> 01:21:43,459
The fucking whore of a mother of yours, 
you, farm manager!

701
01:21:43,873 --> 01:21:46,145
How dare you talk to me like this here?

702
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:49,638
If I tell about this to the Master he'll
kick you out of this place in not time!

703
01:21:51,422 --> 01:21:53,269
I'll dug out our eyes!

704
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:56,750
- You dirty scum!
- No!

705
01:21:56,785 --> 01:21:58,966
- What are you doing?
- Diry scum!

706
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:00,823
You mustn't do this! You hear me? Come here!

707
01:22:01,324 --> 01:22:04,166
Your... your mistake, Mr. Brayner is 
that you didn't count these!

708
01:22:04,564 --> 01:22:06,155
Because those were picked by
the French!

709
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:07,811
Who picked those?

710
01:22:08,054 --> 01:22:10,367
You turd! You dirty turd!

711
01:22:11,153 --> 01:22:13,442
- Ilonka! This isn't nice!
- Bastard!

712
01:22:13,477 --> 01:22:16,257
Bastard!

713
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:21,514
Mr. Brayner! I saw it, and I can
testify 

714
01:22:21,549 --> 01:22:23,931
that these bins were brought here
by Andras Fabian!

715
01:22:24,015 --> 01:22:26,143
The two of you might be having an
agreement! I don't have to believe you!

716
01:22:26,815 --> 01:22:29,046
German

717
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:31,262
But I put a sign on all my bins!

718
01:22:31,942 --> 01:22:34,438
There is a potato stem on the 
top of all my bins!

719
01:22:35,286 --> 01:22:37,758
Here! Here is the potato stem!

720
01:22:38,342 --> 01:22:44,029
It's mine! Here! Here! Here, 
it's mine! You can see!

721
01:22:44,942 --> 01:22:48,149
I'm not lying! Nobody among us 
would lie to you

722
01:22:48,184 --> 01:22:50,372
because of a wretched bin!

723
01:23:10,771 --> 01:23:13,203
German

724
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:15,747
German

725
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,782
German

726
01:23:20,445 --> 01:23:21,719
German

727
01:23:23,447 --> 01:23:26,159
Don't cry, Ilonka!
Calm down!

728
01:23:26,378 --> 01:23:28,635
You were smart to put
a sign on the bins!

729
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:31,483
You're a smart woman!

730
01:23:31,914 --> 01:23:33,506
German

731
01:23:34,179 --> 01:23:36,034
German

732
01:23:41,652 --> 01:23:43,604
Anything happened, Mr. Brayner?

733
01:23:47,267 --> 01:23:50,147
Forgive me. I was wrong.

734
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:55,395
I'll fix the numbers accordingly,
Mrs. Fabian. I'm sorry.

735
01:23:57,628 --> 01:24:04,382
But this kid brought some very bad news.
I don't even know how to put it.

736
01:24:07,021 --> 01:24:09,662
The Master sent word that Abris Kontor 
just died.

737
01:26:18,878 --> 01:26:20,311
It must be burned.

738
01:26:36,511 --> 01:26:39,895
He must be buried as soon as possible,
to avoid an epidemic.

739
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:44,349
What's wrong with you, Brayner? He just 
died an hour ago, and you're already 
hurrying us?

740
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:52,151
Go out, everybody! I'll wash the dead.
Alone.

741
01:26:55,247 --> 01:27:00,744
I do it alone back home as well. 
And then he'll need a coffin.

742
01:27:00,946 --> 01:27:02,986
German

743
01:27:04,027 --> 01:27:07,274
German

744
01:27:07,607 --> 01:27:11,190
Mr. Brayner! He'll need a coffin.

745
01:27:11,683 --> 01:27:14,970
I heard. I just have no idea
where to get one.

746
01:27:15,005 --> 01:27:19,578
A coffin, nowadays? Wouldn't 
a bin be good instead?

747
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:26,596
A bin? Fuck your mother, you lousy
bastard! A bin?

748
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:33,301
No coffin! No bells! No priest!

749
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:37,835
'cos everything's good for a Magyar?
Everything's good for a poor man?

750
01:27:38,134 --> 01:27:42,501
Sound the bells, by the love of God, 
I'm telling you!

751
01:27:44,772 --> 01:27:46,908
Is it the Magyars everybody wants
to play tricks with?

752
01:27:48,677 --> 01:27:50,740
Is it the Magyars everbody are after?

753
01:27:51,168 --> 01:27:54,936
Do you really think... that even bin is 
good enough for us?

754
01:27:56,336 --> 01:28:00,297
You're right. Everybody are after us.

755
01:28:01,648 --> 01:28:04,169
I wonder why do they like 
us so much?

756
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:09,057
All-in-all, he need a decent
burial.

757
01:28:53,464 --> 01:28:54,498
The Master.

758
01:29:00,453 --> 01:29:03,174
His wife lays there. 
She died last year.

759
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:07,134
I'll go there and clean it a little.

760
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:11,837
Don't you have a family, Mr. Brayner?

761
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:17,733
I do. In America. They went there
2 years ago.

762
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:22,182
I've already been working here back then.
It was very hard for them to achieve that.

763
01:29:22,959 --> 01:29:26,381
- Why don't you go after them?
- From here? Now?

764
01:29:27,558 --> 01:29:29,724
Germany is at war with America.

765
01:29:30,925 --> 01:29:35,029
With them as well? The French here
next to us,

766
01:29:35,956 --> 01:29:40,796
beyond Hungary the Russians, and 
America as well? 

767
01:29:41,612 --> 01:29:46,068
It's a lot even just to enumerate them! Not
to mention fighting them all!

768
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,493
Thank you.

769
01:29:57,357 --> 01:29:59,613
I'd like to ask something from you, Mr. Brayner.

770
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:02,882
- What?
- There is a picture in my room.

771
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:06,614
A picture of a saint. I'd like to take it with
me if I may.

772
01:30:09,734 --> 01:30:13,734
- Why do you need that?
- I'd like to take it home, if I may.

773
01:30:14,396 --> 01:30:17,188
All right, Mrs. Fabian. We'll have a 
look at that picture.

774
01:30:21,045 --> 01:30:23,436
The Master should be told about 
the burial.

775
01:30:24,516 --> 01:30:25,612
Why?

776
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:29,995
Because we've already decided
about it.

777
01:30:30,597 --> 01:30:33,232
That frenchmen will be the priest. That Lyon.

778
01:30:33,782 --> 01:30:35,072
... or whatever he's called.

779
01:31:17,316 --> 01:31:19,620
Latin

780
01:31:19,781 --> 01:31:21,614
Latin

781
01:31:21,951 --> 01:31:24,974
Latin

782
01:31:26,007 --> 01:31:29,351
Latin

783
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:39,222
<i>Lord, thou hast been</i>

784
01:31:39,572 --> 01:31:45,412
<i>our dwelling place,</i>

785
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:53,728
<i>In all</i>

786
01:31:53,763 --> 01:32:01,535
<i>generations.</i>

787
01:32:02,536 --> 01:32:07,016
<i>Before </i>

788
01:32:07,051 --> 01:32:13,137
<i>the mountains were </i>

789
01:32:13,172 --> 01:32:16,553
<i>brought forth.</i>

790
01:32:17,649 --> 01:32:22,272
<i>Or ever thou hadst formed</i>

791
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:31,016
<i>the earth and the world,</i>

792
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:37,073
<i>Even from everlasting</i>

793
01:32:37,108 --> 01:32:42,840
<i>to everlasting,</i>

794
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:46,040
<i>thou art God.</i>

795
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:53,529
<i>And will be that</i>

796
01:32:54,160 --> 01:33:00,296
<i>at all times.</i>

797
01:33:31,388 --> 01:33:33,971
It's still some time until 
we finish the harvest.

798
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:37,623
How much longer? Like a month?

799
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:41,606
One and a half at most. What's that?
Nothing.

800
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:47,235
Now I'm certain that I'm pregnant.

801
01:33:49,513 --> 01:33:52,139
That's why I fainted at the chuch.

802
01:33:52,689 --> 01:33:55,794
There, in that big city.

803
01:33:56,633 --> 01:34:00,410
Be happy for that! You go home now,
and raise them all.

804
01:34:01,282 --> 01:34:03,530
At least you've got some money now.

805
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,513
My brother-in-law wrote again.

806
01:34:10,818 --> 01:34:12,922
He got the steel-framed bicycle. 

807
01:34:14,434 --> 01:34:16,913
He even settled the advance payment
for the house!

808
01:34:17,013 --> 01:34:21,056
We'll have some animals too.
Hopefully we'll live much easier from now on.

809
01:34:24,176 --> 01:34:28,712
And perhaps we might even go to the carnival
once with Andras. I mean, if there will be any.

810
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:33,706
Never in my whole life have I ever danced.
Except on my wedding.

811
01:34:35,004 --> 01:34:41,004
Only once? You see, I haven't danced not
even once!

812
01:34:42,204 --> 01:34:44,181
And as it is, I probably never will!

813
01:34:45,988 --> 01:34:48,532
The Master wanted to talk to you 
about this long ago.

814
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:53,693
It's about that he suggests you 
to stay here.

815
01:34:54,262 --> 01:34:58,247
Whoever wants. You'll be given some land,
and a house.

816
01:34:58,554 --> 01:35:00,176
And everybody can be his own Master.

817
01:35:04,385 --> 01:35:08,879
German

818
01:35:09,576 --> 01:35:12,352
You'll feel welcomed here. He says.

819
01:35:14,712 --> 01:35:17,624
- They're waiting for us back home?
- Who's waiting for you?

820
01:35:18,673 --> 01:35:21,634
They are... Relatives, friends.

821
01:35:22,809 --> 01:35:26,358
Anyway, I lived my whole life there.
That's where I'm at home. 

822
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:32,514
So, I, for my part, don't 
want to stay here.

823
01:36:03,738 --> 01:36:05,514
Don't annoy that dog all the time,
Bandi!

824
01:36:06,361 --> 01:36:07,260
Don't you hear that?

825
01:36:10,644 --> 01:36:13,626
This is the 424, Bandi! Hear that?

826
01:36:28,297 --> 01:36:31,328
Why are you telling me this is 
the 424?

827
01:36:35,472 --> 01:36:38,953
Andras! Andras!

828
01:36:39,541 --> 01:36:42,513
Aunt Zsofi! Uncle Daniel!

829
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:46,114
You're here at last! Welcome back!

830
01:36:46,283 --> 01:36:48,850
You're here at last!

831
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:53,399
Let me help! Let me carry something as well!

832
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:58,807
You're here! Andras! Andras! Andras!

833
01:36:59,370 --> 01:37:03,867
Ah, you're back! You're here at last!

834
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:06,919
You're back!

835
01:37:06,911 --> 01:37:10,720
The 'Americanas' are coming!
There!

836
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,240
The 'Americanas' are here!

837
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:17,590
The 'Americanas' have returned!

838
01:37:17,975 --> 01:37:19,818
Aunt Zsuzska! They're here!
You hear me?

839
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:22,347
How can you have such
long steps, Andras?

840
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:26,194
Folks are amazed how long
you can step!

841
01:37:26,866 --> 01:37:31,111
- It's almost like a miracle!
- Man must go fast! He must!

842
01:37:36,088 --> 01:37:39,368
- Was he a German soldier?
- Yes.

843
01:37:40,976 --> 01:37:42,466
A child-soldier.

844
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:47,424
And... and how old was that
German soldier?

845
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,392
Well, about 17 or 

846
01:37:51,553 --> 01:37:55,256
even younger. They are all just children,

847
01:37:56,464 --> 01:38:00,217
just as poor Abris was. God rest him.

848
01:38:01,345 --> 01:38:03,233
Cheers!

849
01:38:09,345 --> 01:38:12,473
They're conscripting everybody here as well.
Even the young ones.

850
01:38:13,088 --> 01:38:17,104
The village is empty. Only women, children
and old ones. Nobody else is left.

851
01:38:18,328 --> 01:38:19,809
God grant you a good evening!

852
01:38:22,793 --> 01:38:24,305
So, here you are!

853
01:38:25,993 --> 01:38:28,064
Well, you're back then!

854
01:38:28,608 --> 01:38:31,821
- As you can see.
- I see.

855
01:38:40,508 --> 01:38:43,933
Well, lads. You must sign these.

856
01:38:44,645 --> 01:38:49,941
- We must?
- Andras Fabian, Dani Kiss,

857
01:38:50,945 --> 01:38:53,769
and Elek Tar. An immediate draft.

858
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:56,967
You must go immediately. But...

859
01:38:58,215 --> 01:39:00,551
you can stay here for the night at least.

860
01:39:10,615 --> 01:39:15,167
Somebody take the child to 
his mother.

861
01:39:20,119 --> 01:39:22,391
There is no need for me to go home 
for such a short time.

862
01:39:24,134 --> 01:39:25,743
All right, all right! Enough of this!

863
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:31,185
Don't cry, Rozika! This will soon 
be over. It's already over, anyway!

864
01:39:32,576 --> 01:39:34,992
You'll see, one or two months only, and
Dani will be back home!

865
01:39:43,846 --> 01:39:46,128
They can't bring them out!

866
01:39:49,928 --> 01:39:51,712
The train is here soon!

867
01:39:59,018 --> 01:40:00,032
They're coming!

868
01:40:10,769 --> 01:40:18,544
Well, <i>This roundshaped sky when 
it goes dark, it lights up!</i>

869
01:40:18,644 --> 01:40:20,626
This is not the one to sing now, Dani!

870
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:24,858
This is what my father sang

871
01:40:25,931 --> 01:40:30,758
in '14, in the first war...

872
01:40:32,254 --> 01:40:46,113
<i>Oh, Magyar, keep immovably</i>

873
01:40:46,566 --> 01:40:56,570
<i>your native country's trust, </i>

874
01:40:56,954 --> 01:41:07,598
<i>for it has borne you, and at death</i>

875
01:41:08,026 --> 01:41:16,819
<i>will consecrate your dust!</i>

876
01:41:17,918 --> 01:41:28,417
<i>No other spot in all the world </i>

877
01:41:28,629 --> 01:41:38,869
<i>can touch your heart as home— </i>

878
01:41:38,969 --> 01:41:52,906
<i>let fortune bless or fortune curse, </i>

879
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:59,693
<i>from hence you shall not roam!</i>

880
01:42:00,062 --> 01:42:05,392
After all we're Hungarian soldiers already,
I was told!

881
01:42:05,492 --> 01:42:07,964
That's right! Hungarian soldiers!

882
01:42:08,344 --> 01:42:10,340
Rozika!

883
01:42:13,807 --> 01:42:15,591
- Don't be afraid, the war will be over soon!
- God bless you!

884
01:42:15,626 --> 01:42:16,575
Stop crying!

885
01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:19,136
You've always been a good wife, Irma!

886
01:42:21,428 --> 01:42:23,453
Come, will you! Come up!

887
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,940
God be with you, Rozika!

888
01:42:24,975 --> 01:42:27,426
Take care of yourself!

889
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:35,219
- Where is my big coat?
- Up in the wagon! - Move!

890
01:42:35,254 --> 01:42:37,298
Here it is, indeed!

891
01:42:38,554 --> 01:42:42,035
Dani! Dani! Where are you?

892
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:44,875
Take care of yourself! Andras!

893
01:42:48,325 --> 01:42:51,592
- Irma! - Here they are!
- Rozika! God be with you!
