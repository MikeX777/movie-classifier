1
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,161
<i>What do you want me to say, Bruce?</i>

2
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,922
He broke into our offices this morning,
accessed our files, our computers.

3
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,289
<i>Do we know what?</i>

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,010
Well, we can assume everything.

5
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,844
This is a major liability.

6
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,206
You're telling me.

7
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,851
Renaldo, now!
<i>Vamos, vamos!</i> Let's go!

8
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,365
<i>Okay, okay!</i>

9
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,281
Does the army know who he is?

10
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,291
Yeah. Francisco Francis.

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,488
Come on, come on.
Just keep walking, keep quiet, okay?

12
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,451
- Renaldo!
- Mama!

13
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,885
No, Renaldo!

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,601
Renaldo!

15
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,923
She's dead, Renaldo.
Come on, come on, come on!

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,923
Come on, come on, get inside!

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,127
Let me out!

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,328
No, no, no, no!

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,289
I don't care what General Aguila
is doing right now!

20
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,488
I want you to put him on the phone, now!

21
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,841
Let me out right now! Let me out!

22
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,490
It's Tony Green from ClearBec!

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,290
Let me out of this car!

24
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,291
Jesus Christ...

25
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,367
<i>Did you ever hear about
the great transformation?</i>

26
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,807
<i>Yeah, I think... What was that again?</i>

27
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,929
<i>It started about 300 years ago in England.</i>

28
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,487
<i>With the turning of public lands
into private property.</i>

29
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,241
<i>It changed the way we think,
the way we view time</i>

30
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,726
<i>and land and water and even people,</i>

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,723
<i>turned them into units,</i>

32
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,681
<i>commodities to be bought and sold
and therefore exploited.</i>

33
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,762
<i>Yeah, but what is bought and
sold is constant.</i>

34
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,126
<i>That's never gonna change.</i>

35
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
You know what, Sarah?
That is absolutely incorrect.

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,688
<i>Society needs to approve of the things
to be turned into commodities</i>

37
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,285
<i>before they can be bought or sold.</i>

38
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,126
People can be bought or sold, correct?
And that did happen.

39
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,409
As horrific and diabolical
as that may sound, it's a fact.

40
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,484
<i>Yeah, and still slavery
happens in some countries today.</i>

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,250
<i>Regrettably true.</i>

42
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,927
<i>But why is it that in Western society,
we no longer buy and sell people?</i>

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,368
<i>Because it's immoral
and it's wrong in all aspects.</i>

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,606
<i>Well, is it wrong to sell water?</i>

45
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,367
<i>What about air?
Would it be wrong to sell air?</i>

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,364
<i>Air! Come on, man!
I mean, you can't sell air.</i>

47
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,731
<i>No?</i>

48
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,564
<i>Well, what if you can't afford it?</i>

49
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,611
<i>There's lots of people all around the world
that can't afford much water.</i>

50
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,290
<i>- And what happens?
- I don't know.</i>

51
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
<i>They die.</i>

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,768
<i>Is it so farfetched, Sarah?</i>

53
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,162
You can sell water,
but you can't sell air? Think about it.

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,208
I'll take the next caller.

55
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,681
Hello, this is Jack Begosian,
you're on the air.

56
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,171
<i>The name's Charlie.</i>

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Hello, Charlie. Good morning.

58
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,491
<i>Morning. I want to know
when we're gonna talk about the real truth.</i>

59
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,085
What truth is that, Charlie?

60
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,561
<i>About the aliens
taking over the White House.</i>

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,648
The aliens taking over
the White House?

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,961
<i>You know you know it, Jack.</i>

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,923
You mean illegal aliens, Charlie.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,923
<i>No, you're making light.</i>

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,721
<i>Extra-terrestrial beings
are a real threat to our way of life, Jack.</i>

66
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,088
Only if you exchange
bodily fluids with them, Charlie.

67
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,810
I'm not, are you?

68
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,041
<i>No.</i>

69
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,242
Then we're doing our part.
Thanks for calling.

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,521
Last call.

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,568
Hi, this is Jack Begosian,
you're on the air.

72
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,244
<i>Hey, man,
it's Van from Oakland.</i>

73
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,210
Hello, Van from Oakland, California.
Thanks for the call.

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,805
<i>- A question, Jack.</i>
- Yes?

75
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,530
<i>Why did you quit?</i>

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,644
Why did I quit what?

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,405
<i>The agency, dude. Everybody knows.</i>

78
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,850
Why did I quit?

79
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,285
<i>Yeah.</i>

80
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,847
<i>Well, Van, when you
can't effect change from within,</i>

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,164
I mean positive change, you have an
obligation if you're at all conscious,

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,527
to get out and try other things.

83
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,727
That's what I'm doing.

84
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,724
<i>Other things?
You mean, like ways to effect change?</i>

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,841
Yes.

86
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,444
<i>You think people want to hear the truth,
man, but they don't.</i>

87
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,569
<i>They want sound bites,
celebrity gossip, scandal, you know.</i>

88
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,131
<i>This is true.</i>

89
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,885
<i>The news doesn't have
to be truthful anymore, just entertaining.</i>

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,961
<i>Nice!</i>

91
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,044
<i>You know, our values are eroding,
our morals...</i>

92
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,168
<i>What are we doing here, man?</i>

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,164
<i>The real question is,
what are we really after?</i>

94
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,084
<i>Is there some ultimate end,</i>

95
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,210
<i>or are we just into some sort of endless
pursuit of nothing more than pleasure?</i>

96
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,361
<i>What do you think?</i>

97
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,125
<i>I believe there's meaning
to it, to our lives.</i>

98
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,321
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

99
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,646
<i>Meaning? Like what?</i>

100
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,165
<i>I haven't learned that answer yet.</i>

101
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,124
<i>Well, keep up the good work
until they shut you down, dude.</i>

102
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,884
<i>They're not gonna shut me down, Van.</i>

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,440
<i>Yeah, they will.
The CIA is suing you, right?</i>

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,930
Rumors.

105
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,401
And I hate to break it to you,
but the CIA does not sue.

106
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,170
<i>What do they do, then?</i>

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,686
<i>They have several other options.</i>

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,845
<i>But I'd welcome my day in court.</i>

109
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,605
<i>Do you think they would? Think about it.</i>

110
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,444
<i>Thanks for the call.</i>

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,124
One last thought.

112
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,965
Sometimes it seems
like a bleak picture.

113
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,811
But it really isn't because
the basic nature of mankind is good.

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,404
<i>And if you don't believe me,
go on the subway,</i>

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,451
<i>on the bus at rush hour and take
a good look around, look at the people...</i>

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,285
Black, brown, red, yellow, white.

117
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,169
<i>They're all coming home
from an honest day's work.</i>

118
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,681
And they don't do it for the money

119
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,525
because their jobs are
paying them very little.

120
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,448
<i>But they do it for their families.</i>

121
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,321
They do it for the ones they love.

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,246
<i>And you can see it,
and you can feel it.</i>

123
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,244
<i>You can see it in their tiredness,
in their resignation,</i>

124
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,051
<i>and you can feel it
in their commitment,</i>

125
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,881
<i>their commitment to their families.</i>

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,566
<i>This is Jack Begosian. Good night.</i>

127
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,165
<i>Good morning.</i>

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,889
And can you make reservations
for Clare van Huysen and I,

129
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,645
at that new French restaurant for two?
You know the one.

130
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,210
<i>At 2:00?</i>

131
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,811
No, for two at 1:00.

132
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,720
<i>But the ribbon-cutting ceremony
at the hospital won't be over by then.</i>

133
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,689
- It won't?
<i>- No.</i>

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,770
<i>I'll make it 2:00 for two.</i>

135
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,842
Okay, perfect. Thank you.

136
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,404
<i>Yes, ClearBec is very pleased</i>

137
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,882
<i>we've funded this new wing dedicated
to children's cancer research.</i>

138
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
<i>And in addition to this wing,</i>

139
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,569
<i>ClearBec has also funded
a hospice for the out-of-town parents,</i>

140
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,120
<i>which will allow them
extended stays with the children</i>

141
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,611
<i>during ongoing treatments.</i>

142
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,406
<i>So, thank you, everyone.
To our future, the children.</i>

143
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,248
Miss Swinton,
how much is ClearBec paying

144
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,449
to the South African government
to privatize their water system?

145
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,965
Miss Swinton!

146
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,771
Does your company still intend to sign
this deal despite the mass protests?

147
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,171
Miss Swinton. Miss Swinton, stop!

148
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,601
Back!

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,891
Your company killed my family,
killed my entire town,

150
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,530
poisoned them,
then shot the survivors.

151
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,205
You will remember them.

152
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,446
<i>I presume
I have your attention now, Miss Swinton.</i>

153
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,171
<i>My country
and many others in South America</i>

154
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,163
<i>are in the war for water rights.</i>

155
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,480
<i>Who knows of this?</i>

156
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,042
<i>Few, as it is not happening
in New Orleans or New York.</i>

157
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,811
<i>The noise you hear is gunfire.</i>

158
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,090
<i>Children, women and men are being
gunned down outside Tayca, Ecuador.</i>

159
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,767
<i>I recorded it, saw it.</i>

160
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,724
<i>Inagua, a local subsidiary of ClearBec,
your family's company,</i>

161
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,442
<i>installed a water purification system
for Tayca and the surrounding area.</i>

162
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,763
<i>The system did not purify.
Just the opposite.</i>

163
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,400
<i>A very bad form of typhus
emerged in the town.</i>

164
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,483
<i>Francisco Francis broke into
the Inagua office.</i>

165
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,609
<i>ClearBec's own report stated what
was happening and how they were involved.</i>

166
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,087
You can't help them.
We have to get out now.

167
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,481
There is always
something you can do.

168
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,330
The dead are the dead.

169
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,444
We can help
the ones that are left.

170
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,682
But look at what
you have in your arms.

171
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,763
Francisco, I can't live
without you again.

172
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,240
We're together forever.

173
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,401
Forever.

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,925
<i>The army, ClearBec's partner in Ecuador,</i>

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,890
<i>moved into my town
and quarantined the area.</i>

176
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,931
<i>They had orders to find Francis</i>

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,243
<i>and kill any residents
that were trying to get out.</i>

178
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,681
<i>No one knew what to do
with the sick and the dying.</i>

179
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,440
<i>Then the soldiers began to get sick.</i>

180
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,647
<i>They began to execute everyone.</i>

181
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,641
<i>Question, Jack. Why'd you quit?</i>

182
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,760
I thought I answered that question already.

183
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,687
<i>Yeah, but I want the real reason.</i>

184
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,521
<i>I stopped believing in lies</i>

185
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,649
<i>including my own.</i>

186
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,768
<i>ClearBec has provided you
quality water products</i>

187
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,002
<i>for over 50 years.</i>

188
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,244
<i>ClearBec stands for
integrity, value, quality.</i>

189
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,248
<i>Your body is over 70% water, over 70%.</i>

190
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,563
<i>You deserve the best water possible.</i>

191
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,766
<i>The kid was my assistant last summer.</i>

192
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,767
Okay? How the hell
did he get to Toronto?

193
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,371
Whatever. He just blew his brains out
in front of my sister

194
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,771
at a press conference, Tony.

195
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,682
Okay, Bruce. You should never have
authorized the use of force here.

196
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,286
- I didn't.
<i>- Then who did?</i>

197
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,290
General Aguila.
He said he had no choice.

198
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,687
That's bullshit! I saw it happen.

199
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,085
It was murder, Bruce.

200
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,485
Aguila is a general
for the Ecuadorian army.

201
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,847
<i>He's not an officer
or an employee of ClearBec.</i>

202
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,441
We are not guilty of anything.

203
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,849
I am saddened and disgusted
as to what happened down there,

204
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,126
<i>but we are not to blame.</i>

205
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,361
Yeah, so, then, what?

206
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,001
- Damage control.
- Damage control?

207
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,087
Yes.

208
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,011
Do you understand
that it was more than just a few villagers?

209
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,209
<i>It was hundreds of people, Bruce!</i>

210
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,443
Even though ClearBec is innocent,
we can't let our South African partners

211
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,807
<i>find out what really happened
down there, all right?</i>

212
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,525
It's best for the company.

213
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,325
Tony, I'll call you back.

214
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,885
<i>Call me back!</i>

215
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,051
How are you?

216
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,891
Jesus, are you all right?

217
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,925
What happened in Ecuador?

218
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,803
I am so sorry you had to see that.

219
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,524
We pulled a file on that kid.
He was a nutcase.

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,163
He was working for
an anti-government rag magazine.

221
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,322
He infiltrated our Ecuadorian offices.

222
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,848
I listened to a tape he left for me.

223
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,406
A tape?

224
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,688
What did we do down there?

225
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
We have interests in
Ecuador, you know that.

226
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,764
- Interests?
- Yes.

227
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,690
A boy doesn't

228
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,368
blow his head off over interests.

229
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,650
We're an international company.

230
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,806
We can't possibly
make everyone happy all the time.

231
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,001
It gets complicated.

232
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,929
It's best if you don't get involved.

233
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,124
Don't get involved in our own company?

234
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,041
The company that our father built.

235
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,849
Morgan, you do lunches,
you do ribbon-cuttings,

236
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,170
you do fund-raisers,
you do bad marriages.

237
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,726
Wow.

238
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,321
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,489
You should go home.

240
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,801
Clean yourself up, okay?

241
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,841
Sorry.

242
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,201
What happened in Ecuador
needs to be contained, Doug.

243
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,521
Believe me, Bruce, I know that.

244
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,327
None of these events
can be traced back to ClearBec at any cost.

245
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,561
Right.

246
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,246
Now, Tony was shaken up,
but I think he will be all right.

247
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,250
But from what I just heard,

248
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,121
I'm afraid your sister might be a problem.

249
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,361
What are you suggesting?

250
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,727
Morgan needs to be deflected.

251
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,211
Goldman Brothers, line two.
You gotta take it.

252
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,531
Bobby, how are you?

253
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,602
How the hell
do you expect me to get this closed?

254
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,170
Have you seen what's
coming up about ClearBec

255
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,725
since that kid blew his brains out?

256
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,964
That kid was a nut-job, Robert.

257
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,767
The press is all over it, Bruce.
It's completely killing the financing.

258
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,283
We have to close by the end of next week.
Otherwise, South Africa pulls out.

259
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,771
That's the scheduled close.

260
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,850
You want to close by the end of next week,
then our fees just doubled.

261
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,160
Does that mean we're not playing squash
on Saturday?

262
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,685
<i>You'll have a new deal memo in an hour.</i>

263
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,404
<i>I want it signed and executed back today.</i>

264
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,606
Fine.

265
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,648
<i>And if anything else like
this happens, Bruce,</i>

266
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,124
we're out of this deal.

267
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,280
Bye-bye.

268
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,360
<i>I have no idea how many were killed.</i>

269
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,680
<i>Hundreds.</i>

270
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,726
<i>They burned the bodies, the evidence.</i>

271
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,450
<i>But some got away.</i>

272
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,364
<i>I did, before they infected people
who survived.</i>

273
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,886
<i>And I pray that
Francisco Francis made it out.</i>

274
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,808
<i>Francis is a great man.</i>

275
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,281
<i>They jailed him, beat
him, tried to kill him.</i>

276
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,249
<i>But he keeps rising up!</i>

277
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,408
<i>He is witness to what happened.
He will tell the truth.</i>

278
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,646
<i>If he is alive, you must help him.</i>

279
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,722
<i>May God have mercy on you
if you don't.</i>

280
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,970
<i>Jason, I made you
your favorite breakfast.</i>

281
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,201
If you're not gonna eat it,
then you might as well go to your room.

282
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,726
What's going on?

283
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,605
I don't know.

284
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,080
He's not eating, just staring at the clock.

285
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,205
What's wrong with the clock?

286
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,566
Nothing.

287
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,128
Since when is he not eating?

288
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,441
A couple of days.

289
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,080
How come you haven't told me?

290
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,684
I've been trying to.

291
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,804
You don't know, he's so
frustrating, I mean...

292
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,966
Karen...

293
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,371
You were the one
who wanted to move out here off the grid.

294
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,086
I know.

295
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,802
And deal with his issues.

296
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,124
I can't do it by myself.

297
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,320
You are not by yourself.

298
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,051
Yes, I am.

299
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,484
You're here, but you're not here.

300
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,207
I feel it, and Jason sure as
hell feels it more than I do.

301
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,360
I know.

302
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,801
You need to spend some time with him.

303
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,850
Quality time.

304
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,521
Jack...

305
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,210
Just be with him.

306
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,408
Spend more time with your son.

307
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,360
Please.

308
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,925
<i>Bruce, listen to me.</i>

309
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,724
<i>I've been thinking about this, okay?</i>

310
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,764
<i>Please, we gotta help these people.
We can't just leave them.</i>

311
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,924
<i>We have to call in World Health.</i>

312
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,647
<i>They can contain the typhus.</i>

313
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,166
Tony, if we call in the WHO,

314
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,890
that's like sending out a press release

315
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,167
saying that ClearBec
caused the typhus outbreak.

316
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,124
If that happens,
the government of South Africa

317
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,600
will pull out of the deal for sure.

318
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,730
You think the South African deal
justifies what Aguila did?

319
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,050
No, I don't, but he said
it was a disaster beyond imagination,

320
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,680
that what he did was the only way
to contain the typhus outbreak.

321
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,404
And you believe him, right?

322
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,370
We have a company to run.
I have shareholders to report to.

323
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,290
<i>Now we have to do the right thing.</i>

324
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,680
What the hell happened
to our filtration system down there?

325
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,602
The river flooded, okay?
That's what happened.

326
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,370
But we've tested for that extensively.

327
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,889
The sewers backed up
and then rats were infesting the town.

328
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,046
The market will crucify us
if this ever gets out.

329
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,766
I don't know, man. I don't know anymore.

330
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,366
I just... You tell me,
what's the official story?

331
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,006
The truth.

332
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,964
He broke into our filtration plant
and sabotaged the system.

333
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,122
That's what caused the typhus outbreak.

334
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,725
The army came in to apprehend him,

335
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,610
Francis and his men fired back,
the army returned fire.

336
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,523
There were casualties, end of story.

337
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,411
<i>Have they gotten to Francis yet?</i>

338
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,522
Yeah, he's hiding up in
the mountains somewhere.

339
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,524
All right, Tony.

340
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,728
You do whatever you can
to help those people down there.

341
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,882
But please keep a lid on it.

342
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,807
You wanna go help me
stack some firewood?

343
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,365
Come on.

344
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,567
I heard you crying last night, Mommy.

345
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,404
Why were you crying?

346
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,807
Because Mommy saw something
that made her feel sad.

347
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,130
<i>My sister called me.
She said she's being followed.</i>

348
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,647
She's been online trying to figure out
what really happened in Ecuador.

349
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,922
- You tapped into her computer?
- Yes.

350
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,968
I never authorized you to do that.

351
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,408
Well, I apologize, Bruce,
I didn't think you'd object.

352
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,767
She's on our system
and we have responsibilities.

353
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,768
We both have to answer
to the Board of Directors.

354
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,724
This is the flavor of the week.
She'll lose interest in a second.

355
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,929
I don't agree.
I think this really has her going.

356
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,644
She made an appointment
with Tom Delmonte about this.

357
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,250
- Her lawyer?
- Yes.

358
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,645
I think we should call in Torrance.

359
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,841
I don't know.

360
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,530
There's a lot of things in this situation
which could use special handling.

361
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,523
We should call in Tor now.

362
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,209
<i>Did you listen to the tape?</i>

363
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,611
<i>Yes.</i>

364
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,162
<i>Were you able to make arrangements
to send money to the boy's family?</i>

365
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,170
I'm sorry, we couldn't locate
any relatives at all.

366
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,484
I need to find out
what happened down there.

367
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,607
ClearBec does have legitimate
interests in South America, Morgan.

368
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,924
Look, the boy stuck a gun into his mouth
and blew his brains out in front of me.

369
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,322
I think something ugly is being covered up.

370
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,764
And I think that you
should not get involved.

371
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,366
Can you find me someone
to send down there?

372
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,289
You're serious?

373
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,328
There's one of our investigators
in Washington that might be helpful.

374
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,640
I could speak to him.

375
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,688
- I'll get back to you.
- Thank you.

376
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,964
It's Calder. We have a situation.

377
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,046
ID number?

378
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,963
237418665.

379
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,771
I understand your
South African deal's in jeopardy.

380
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,968
<i>That's why I'm calling you.</i>

381
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,120
Well, you should have called earlier.

382
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,968
We have some problem areas.

383
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,051
And I think Morgan Swinton
may be one of them.

384
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,440
She and Bruce really close?

385
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,047
Well, they're siblings,

386
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,522
but if push comes to shove,
I imagine Bruce will do what he has to do.

387
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,009
Send me what you have on this.
Send me everything.

388
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,809
<i>I was in South America a long time,</i>

389
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,167
I never saw anything like this.

390
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,004
It's a serious mess.

391
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,728
We have to make this disappear.

392
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,570
Yeah?

393
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,684
<i>Doing much these days, Jack?</i>

394
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,007
Not really.

395
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,731
Some civilian wants something checked
out in Ecuador, good money.

396
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,881
You take it.

397
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,561
<i>Still got a price on my head down there.</i>

398
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,728
Take a flight, look around, fly back home,
file a report, pick up a nice check.

399
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,610
What's the matter?

400
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,602
- I don't think so.
<i>- You can't outrun it, Jack.</i>

401
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,600
You ought to know that by now.

402
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,723
I don't like you, Clive.

403
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,120
No. You don't like anybody
who knows what you did.

404
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,446
Come on, let's pick this up, come on.

405
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,000
You forget it was for a good cause.

406
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,642
It wasn't for a cause.
It was for vested interests.

407
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,290
<i>Take the job.</i>

408
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,486
I got a family now.

409
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,801
You're marking time.

410
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,161
I've already hung up, Clive...

411
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,531
Hey, you're leaving earlier and earlier.

412
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,846
I have a lot of work to do.

413
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,847
I listen to your show every night, Jack.

414
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,090
Do you know that?

415
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,326
I lie in bed and I listen to it
until I fall asleep.

416
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,131
It's the next best thing
to having you beside me.

417
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,281
I'm always amazed
at how much you give to complete strangers.

418
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,084
It's part of the show.

419
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,920
I wish you'd bring more of the show home.

420
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,924
What is it, Jack?

421
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,682
What are you looking for?

422
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,124
Like the show says.

423
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,365
Yeah...

424
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,562
Well, maybe the truth is right here.

425
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,327
You were always
the smartest girl in the room.

426
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,845
I gotta go.

427
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,521
Jason ate a little bit with me today.

428
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,010
Just a little bit.

429
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,762
<i>I don't care what you say!
I think it was stupid.</i>

430
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,605
I disagree. It wasn't stupid.

431
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,809
It was an impassioned choice, a sacrifice.

432
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,566
<i>My father always told me there is nothing
worth laying your life down for.</i>

433
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,526
<i>I disagree.</i>

434
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,240
<i>You don't know what you're talking about!</i>

435
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,640
What is life without freedom?

436
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,091
<i>You're still alive.</i>

437
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,931
<i>Is freedom worth dying for?</i>

438
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,291
<i>No, it is not!</i>

439
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,124
That's the question.

440
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,290
<i>This is Jack Begosian. Good night.</i>

441
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,044
<i>And good morning.</i>

442
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,566
Jack?

443
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,125
Jack Begosian?

444
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,687
Yes?

445
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,444
I'm Morgan Swinton.

446
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,803
Yes, I know. I saw you on the news.

447
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,521
You have a moment?
I need to talk with you.

448
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,809
<i>The village was quarantined
and many people,</i>

449
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,010
<i>perhaps hundreds, died or were executed
for corporate protection.</i>

450
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,085
ClearBec may be implicated.

451
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,803
I need someone to go down there
and find out what happened.

452
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,201
And you come highly recommended.

453
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm told you're very familiar
with that part of the world.

454
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,445
I've already said no.

455
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,329
And I'm asking you to reconsider.

456
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,566
There may be survivors,
witnesses to what happened.

457
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,483
If there are, I need you
to bring them back here.

458
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,528
- And then what?
- I'll go public.

459
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I'll stop them from doing
that deal in South Africa

460
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,125
because you know
what they'll do down there.

461
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,686
Bleed it dry.

462
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,091
<i>They'll be left trying to
suck an elephant through a straw.</i>

463
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,322
<i>I'll pay you very well, Mr. Begosian.</i>

464
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,128
Fifty thousand before
you travel down to Ecuador.

465
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,807
If you come back
with witnesses, another 200,000.

466
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,885
All expenses paid,
including private air travel.

467
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,202
Wasn't your father
the founder of ClearBec?

468
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,121
Yes.

469
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,486
Then why are you doing this?

470
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,010
My father taught me everything has a price,

471
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,809
but not everything should be for sale.

472
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,920
Ever seen a boy
blow his brains out in front of you?

473
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,250
Unfortunately.

474
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,162
ClearBec was a good company,
Mr. Begosian.

475
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,649
Listen to this recording.

476
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,725
It mentions a name, Francisco Francis.

477
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,407
That name mean anything to you?

478
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,450
<i>A very bad form of typhus
emerged in the town.</i>

479
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,490
<i>Francisco Francis broke into
the Inagua office.</i>

480
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,007
<i>ClearBec's own report stated what
was happening and how they were involved.</i>

481
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,650
<i>They had orders to find Francis</i>

482
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,007
<i>and kill any residents
that were trying to get out.</i>

483
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
<i>No one knew what to do
with the sick and the dying.</i>

484
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,009
<i>They began to execute everyone.</i>

485
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,562
I was offered $250,000
to take a job in South America.

486
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,844
$250,000?

487
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,166
Who would offer you that?

488
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,080
Her name is Morgan Swinton. She's a major
shareholder in ClearBec, the water company.

489
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,769
Her father founded the company
and her brother, Bruce, runs it.

490
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,045
It's been a long time
since you've been out in the field, Jack.

491
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,565
You don't have to do this.

492
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,323
Listen to me.
There was a name on the CD.

493
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,448
There was a name mentioned.

494
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,728
- Francisco.
- Who?

495
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,044
Francisco Francis.

496
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,923
He was responsible for organizing
a peasant revolt in South America.

497
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,526
They were protesting
the privatization of water and land rights,

498
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,688
and industrial pollution.

499
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,685
He became

500
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,930
quite militant

501
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,326
and he was labeled an eco-terrorist.

502
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
You knew him.

503
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,928
If he's alive, and if he's in trouble,
I need to help him.

504
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,887
Why?

505
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,165
Lowe him.

506
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,166
For what?

507
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,482
You know I can't tell you that.

508
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,011
It's best you don't know.

509
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,003
My God, what did you do down there?

510
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,285
Just think of the money.

511
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,360
Look, if you... If you need to do this...

512
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,201
I need your blessing.

513
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,525
Then do it.

514
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,126
Do it, but don't do it for us.

515
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,529
It's the same thing.

516
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,605
Okay.

517
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,801
Okay.

518
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,370
<i>This is Jack Begosian.</i>

519
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,206
<i>Somewhere along the line,
we decided to turn the seven deadly sins</i>

520
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,410
<i>into virtues. Greed, gluttony, anger...</i>

521
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,766
Hello?

522
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,561
Yes, this is Jack Begosian.

523
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,166
<i>We're on.</i>

524
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,486
Thank you.

525
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,881
Don't thank me yet.

526
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,729
I need the 250 up front.

527
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,090
<i>All up front?</i>

528
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,768
Yes, for my family,
and any unforeseen expenses.

529
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,044
My advice is to keep a low profile

530
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,804
<i>and stay away from your brother.</i>

531
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,211
My brother would never harm me.

532
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,484
You can't guarantee that.

533
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,401
I'll get back to you to
finalize arrangements.

534
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,968
- Did you get my list?
<i>- Yes.</i>

535
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,211
I arrive in Quito tomorrow.

536
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,368
<i>Who are you working for now?</i>

537
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,249
Myself. Got to go...

538
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,842
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

539
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,564
What's the matter, champ?

540
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,602
Come on, walk me to the truck.
I wanna talk to you.

541
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,926
Come on.

542
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,526
<i>Can you get the door for me?</i>

543
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,284
<i>Okay, Dad.</i>

544
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,286
<i>- You got it?
- Yeah.</i>

545
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,960
<i>Good boy.</i>

546
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,126
Come here, I want to talk to you.

547
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,565
Okay.

548
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,524
You know, Daddy's gotta
go away on this trip.

549
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,760
So you gotta be the man
of the house, right?

550
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,482
You gotta take care of Mom, all right?

551
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,130
And no matter what happens,
you're gonna be my son forever.

552
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,486
Right?

553
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,522
Nothing could ever change that.

554
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,728
<i>And I’m gonna be your dad forever, right?</i>

555
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,921
<i>Yeah, forever.</i>

556
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,645
Now, look.

557
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,250
See this?

558
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,242
Look at that. Who's there?

559
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,367
Me and Mom.

560
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,329
You and Mom, that's right.

561
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,165
And I'm gonna
have you guys with me all the time.

562
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,005
And I'm gonna place you
right here next to my heart, okay?

563
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,884
I have you with me all the time,

564
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,440
then nothing can ever happen to me.

565
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,009
<i>This is Jack Begosian.</i>

566
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,766
<i>Somewhere along the line,
we decided to turn the seven deadly sins</i>

567
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,089
<i>into virtues. Greed, gluttony,
anger, avarice...</i>

568
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,929
<i>Mr. Begosian has been
instructed not to answer that question</i>

569
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,361
<i>for the sake of national security.</i>

570
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,641
<i>This is a matter of national security!</i>

571
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,968
<i>I am instructing you to
answer the question!</i>

572
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,170
<i>I will remove Mr. Begosian from this
hearing before I instruct him to answer.</i>

573
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,971
<i>Did you He under oath, Mr. Begosian?</i>

574
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,963
<i>Don't answer that question, Jack!</i>

575
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,281
<i>The CIA has no standing in this hearing.</i>

576
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,765
<i>Please answer the question, Mr. Begosian.</i>

577
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,889
<i>Did you He under oath?</i>

578
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,086
<i>Yes.</i>

579
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,730
<i>I lied.</i>

580
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,484
Welcome to Quito, Mr. Shore.

581
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,486
Come on up.

582
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,971
I got something to show you.

583
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,280
Thank you.

584
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,522
Welcome to my home. Come on in.

585
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,010
Close the door.

586
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,121
Miguel said you might need
a little bit of protection, so...

587
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,206
You pick.

588
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,530
Come on, let's get out of here.

589
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,648
I'll give you a good price.

590
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,885
Let's go.

591
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,250
What's your hurry?
I'm gonna get you there on time.

592
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,970
Give me the keys.

593
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,201
- You don't want me to drive?
- No.

594
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,486
I'm your guy.

595
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,721
- Get in the car.
- Good!

596
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,047
That way, I can keep drinking.

597
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,449
You're lucky you know my friend Miguel.

598
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,882
He says you two worked together before.

599
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,726
Says I can trust you.

600
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,651
He said I could trust you.

601
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,570
I'm very good at what I do, my friend.

602
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,844
So, you work both sides, then?

603
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,687
Yeah, but only one at a time, okay?

604
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,881
A man of principles.

605
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,204
I'm a professional.
You pay me, I work for you.

606
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,568
And I'm the only one
that knows where they're at.

607
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,440
I got smugglers that work
the mountains for me.

608
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,730
And they see a lot of things.

609
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,245
Tell me this one thing, then.

610
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,567
What?

611
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,010
Francisco Francis, is he alive?

612
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,370
For now, yeah.

613
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,845
I arranged a back-up
vehicle like you asked.

614
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,803
It's up by Esmeraldas.

615
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,483
It's the old slave town.
It's gonna be a quick extraction.

616
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,291
We find Francis, we're in and we're out.

617
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,841
I know you have a plane waiting.

618
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,967
But what if Francis
doesn't want to go with you?

619
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,122
What then, my friend?

620
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,362
Then he won't survive.

621
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,610
South Africa has over 50 million people.

622
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,768
We'll be running the entire water system

623
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,808
and we're in negotiations with Greece.

624
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,763
<i>- Greece is going to privatize water?</i>
- Yes.

625
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,207
<i>Look, I've been
hearing nasty rumors about ClearBec.</i>

626
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,491
Our reputation as an international provider
of high-quality water service is impeccable.

627
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,369
<i>Yeah, right, I'll send you my story.</i>

628
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,520
Send it to me before it goes to print.
Thanks, Wayne.

629
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,962
You're late. You have docs to sign.

630
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,965
I'm not signing anything
until I get some answers about Ecuador.

631
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,285
Wouldn't mind a coffee, though.

632
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,488
Tracy, coffee, straight up.

633
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,406
Morgan, this deal with
South Africa is huge.

634
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,121
We are going to own
every drop that country's got.

635
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,565
Wow. That'll certainly drive up
the profits, won't it, people?

636
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,085
Come sign these...

637
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,844
That'll be my arm.

638
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,880
Hang on.

639
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,088
All right, all right, all right.

640
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,283
When was the last time
you brought the kids up to the lake house,

641
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,124
like Dad did with us?

642
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,168
I want you to listen to me.

643
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,043
I have power over your bank accounts,
your estate and your stocks.

644
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,202
That's the way Dad set this up.

645
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,611
And I can have that changed.

646
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,170
No, you can't.

647
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,605
You can't.

648
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,291
Your well-being is inextricably linked
to the well-being of ClearBec.

649
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,404
You have to sign these papers.

650
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,482
You need to sign these papers.

651
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,167
No. You need me to sign these papers.

652
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,050
I have to have a cup of coffee.

653
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,924
Thank you.

654
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,921
Yes?

655
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,728
Morgan just hired Jack Begosian
to go to Ecuador.

656
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,409
Morgan's hired someone
to go to Ecuador?

657
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,171
Not just someone, Jack Begosian.

658
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,409
Who's Jack Begosian?

659
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,168
That's correct, General.

660
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,680
I'm sending you
an extensive file on him right now.

661
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,366
Jack Begosian?

662
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,965
That's correct.

663
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,561
<i>- I understand, Mr. Calder.</i>
- Thank you, General.

664
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,885
The army is controlling access
to the area where my men have seen him.

665
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,969
Give them a little bit of money
and they'll let us move through.

666
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,523
Slow down here.
Just let me do the talking, okay?

667
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,160
I know how to handle these matters.

668
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,850
Listen. If he asks who I am, tell him
I'm a Canadian nature photographer.

669
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,804
- Do you have a camera?
- No.

670
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,329
That can be a problem.

671
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,763
Commander, how are you?

672
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,764
Listen, he's a Canadian photographer.

673
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,281
We want to go up the hill.

674
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,607
To take pictures of the
beautiful Ecuadorian landscape.

675
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,326
Ask him how long
it would be on foot to the bird sanctuary.

676
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,923
Bird sanctuary...

677
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,606
A day and a half.

678
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,925
Ask him if he would be so kind,

679
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,447
if we leave him our jeep,
and let us pass through on foot.

680
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,321
He says yes.

681
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,640
Okay, tell him,
"Thank you very much,"

682
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,801
and come get your stuff.

683
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,921
Thank you.

684
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,521
Get them out of the road.

685
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,644
He's dead.

686
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,807
It's okay.

687
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,566
Are you from Tayca?

688
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,483
No, all the people
in Tayca are dead.

689
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,603
The sickness
killed almost everyone.

690
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,245
Morning, Bruce.

691
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,921
Some liabilities close to home
have developed.

692
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,721
- With my sister?
- No, Tony Green.

693
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,368
- Tony?
- He's going to the press.

694
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,250
He already set up a
meeting with a reporter.

695
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,329
Are you crazy?

696
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,801
You can't do that!
You cannot shoot soldiers here!

697
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,882
This is General Aguila's area!

698
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,042
- And then you leave a witness behind!
- Too late.

699
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,809
Yeah, too late, too late for me! I'm toast!

700
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,522
General, three of our men
were found dead near Gauinee.

701
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,850
Their bodies were brought
down to the side of the road.

702
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,401
Efficient.
What an asshole.

703
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,480
That should be our man.

704
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,087
Find him and keep me informed.

705
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,967
Yes, General.

706
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,688
Top of that ridge. That's it.

707
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,885
They're up there.

708
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,283
- Past the ridge?
- Yeah.

709
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,360
What are you doing? What?

710
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,844
I don't climb at night.

711
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,084
<i>I wish...</i>

712
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,690
<i>I wish...</i>

713
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,524
Good evening, Mr. Green.

714
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,964
Would you mind terribly
if I called you Tony?

715
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,803
Or would you prefer Antonio?

716
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,043
Yeah, I would prefer you call me
by my goddamn name.

717
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,043
I am Anthony Green, American.

718
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,600
Now cut me loose, chief, will you?

719
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,729
Who was your meeting with, Mr. Green?

720
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,125
I had no meeting.
My meeting's with you.

721
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,683
It's our understanding you were scheduled
to meet with a member of the press,

722
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,250
unfriendly to our cause.

723
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,166
Yeah, your cause...
That's what you call it?

724
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,006
It is my duty to protect my country,
Mr. Green.

725
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,680
Okay, let me tell you something
about your understanding.

726
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,683
It's based on a misunderstanding

727
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,683
because I didn't meet with any reporter.

728
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,168
What an unfortunate answer,
Mr. Green, as we say...

729
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,602
For I have already met with the reporter.

730
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,927
This only confirms
our suspicions about you.

731
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,206
No. No, no, no.

732
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,891
My men will take care of you from here.

733
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,528
The reason this has happened

734
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,682
is because too many people
have too much,

735
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,930
and too many people have too little.

736
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,011
So this is not over by any means.

737
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,363
I agree with you.

738
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,562
Hey! Hey, man!

739
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,402
I am an American. I'm an American!

740
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,968
You can't do this to me!

741
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,046
Yes, General?

742
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,567
Your associate seems to be missing.

743
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,768
Well, if you find him,
have him give me a call.

744
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,486
I will.

745
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,806
We have located your Jack Begosian.

746
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,160
There is $1 million for you
if you could dissuade

747
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,643
Francisco Francis and Jack Begosian
from leaving Ecuador.

748
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,927
Mr. Calder,
I believe they're worth a million each.

749
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,364
I think you're right.

750
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,571
<i>This is Jack Begosian, you're on the air.</i>

751
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,722
<i>I was hoping
we could talk about eternity, Jack.</i>

752
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,010
In what sense?

753
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,243
<i>Do you think that
there's some aspect of ourselves</i>

754
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,607
<i>that lives on, beyond this life?</i>

755
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,207
<i>Yes, in the example we leave.</i>

756
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,684
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

757
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,571
In the example you leave behind,
good or bad,

758
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,529
that's what's remembered.

759
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,645
<i>How do you want to be remembered, Jack?</i>

760
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,371
<i>Well, I've done some things
that I'm not proud of.</i>

761
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,442
<i>And will never be forgotten</i>

762
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,762
<i>that are</i>

763
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,442
impossible to forgive.

764
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,366
<i>But I'm trying to do my best
to make amends and catch up</i>

765
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,245
<i>and do my part.</i>

766
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,809
<i>Thanks for the call.</i>

767
00:55:39,155 --> 00:55:40,680
You all right?

768
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,316
Hold on.

769
00:56:10,275 --> 00:56:12,039
Put your gun down.

770
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:15,036
Put your gun down!

771
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:25,081
Hey!

772
00:57:09,435 --> 00:57:11,722
You'll get your money
by next Friday, Quako.

773
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,560
I must tell you,
if this is forced to referendum,

774
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:16,637
we cannot deliver on our agreement.

775
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:20,323
<i>If this is not settled next Friday,
it may well go to referendum.</i>

776
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,966
Rest assured, we'll be closed next week.

777
00:57:23,035 --> 00:57:24,878
<i>My associates and I
have always felt ClearBec</i>

778
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:27,083
<i>was the most qualified company
with which to work.</i>

779
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:28,236
Good.

780
00:57:28,355 --> 00:57:30,926
<i>But we've been hearing
some very unfavorable rumors</i>

781
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:32,679
<i>regarding ClearBec in Ecuador.</i>

782
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:33,881
It's nothing to worry about.

783
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:37,596
<i>There are many companies
we can do this deal with, Bruce.</i>

784
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:39,883
Rest assured we'll be closed.

785
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:40,956
<i>Good.</i>

786
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:43,642
We'll be awaiting your payment.

787
00:57:51,955 --> 00:57:55,084
<i>Roberto Shore de Canada.</i>
What is your real name?

788
00:57:58,755 --> 00:57:59,961
Jack.

789
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:03,441
Jack Begosian.

790
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:08,200
What brings you to these mountains,
Jack Begosian?

791
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:18,245
I came looking for the survivors
of the attack at Tayca.

792
00:58:19,275 --> 00:58:21,403
Why? To what end?

793
00:58:22,835 --> 00:58:24,678
The people I work for,

794
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:28,525
they want the world
to know the wrong that was done here,

795
00:58:29,155 --> 00:58:31,203
and the people who did it, charged.

796
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:32,436
That's never gonna happen.

797
00:58:33,395 --> 00:58:36,638
ClearBec pays millions and millions
of dollars to the politicians here.

798
00:58:37,155 --> 00:58:38,236
They can be stopped.

799
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:42,197
Okay. Well, I admire your spirit.

800
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:49,241
Were you at Tayca?

801
00:58:49,675 --> 00:58:51,040
Yes, I was.

802
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:52,835
There was a massacre there.

803
00:58:53,635 --> 00:58:55,046
I'm aware.

804
00:58:56,275 --> 00:58:58,164
What brought you there?

805
00:58:59,195 --> 00:59:00,685
My father lived in Tayca.

806
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:04,837
We were visiting him when the typhus broke.

807
00:59:08,955 --> 00:59:13,404
I went to the offices of Inagua
to get some answers.

808
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:16,080
I got none.

809
00:59:16,355 --> 00:59:19,165
So I broke in at night
and I got many answers.

810
00:59:24,555 --> 00:59:26,717
They say that I poisoned the water.

811
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:29,002
They say that I attacked the army.

812
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:31,480
Neither is true.

813
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,206
It's a lie.

814
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:35,841
I believe you.

815
00:59:41,315 --> 00:59:42,601
Let me help you, Francisco.

816
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:28,040
Thank you.

817
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:36,481
So, how do you know my name, Jack?

818
01:00:45,715 --> 01:00:49,162
You were the founder and leader
of La Vida Campesina.

819
01:00:53,635 --> 01:00:55,524
I didn't lead them well.

820
01:00:58,075 --> 01:01:00,442
The movement almost died underneath me.

821
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:05,517
I learned that nothing grows
out of the barrel of a gun

822
01:01:06,835 --> 01:01:08,280
but violence.

823
01:01:09,155 --> 01:01:12,602
And that Mao was wrong and Gandhi is right.

824
01:01:14,475 --> 01:01:17,718
You said you found answers
when you broke into the offices of Inagua.

825
01:01:20,235 --> 01:01:22,636
ClearBec's filtration system
is what caused the typhus.

826
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:25,520
You have proof?

827
01:01:25,675 --> 01:01:28,406
I have their records. I downloaded them.
I have them over here.

828
01:01:28,795 --> 01:01:30,399
Then come with me.

829
01:01:30,475 --> 01:01:33,160
Be a witness against ClearBec.
Tell your story.

830
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:34,686
Francisco...

831
01:01:35,515 --> 01:01:36,960
Come with me.

832
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:38,480
Francisco...

833
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:41,761
I don't trust him.

834
01:01:41,835 --> 01:01:42,882
We don't know him.

835
01:01:42,955 --> 01:01:45,845
It's fine.
I'll tell him.

836
01:01:50,155 --> 01:01:52,601
My wife, she doesn't trust you.

837
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:54,796
I know.

838
01:01:55,195 --> 01:01:56,835
She thinks that our family won't be safe.

839
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,805
Is your family safe here?

840
01:02:01,235 --> 01:02:03,158
How long can they live like this?

841
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:05,203
How long can anyone live?

842
01:02:06,235 --> 01:02:08,158
The answer's always the same, until we die.

843
01:02:09,835 --> 01:02:10,961
Come with me.

844
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:15,838
We will stop ClearBec from doing what
they did here in other countries.

845
01:02:16,435 --> 01:02:18,756
How do you know they'll listen to us?

846
01:02:19,795 --> 01:02:21,320
You have to trust me.

847
01:02:22,635 --> 01:02:24,080
Francisco...

848
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:26,925
You must trust me.

849
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:28,805
You must trust me!

850
01:02:45,755 --> 01:02:48,520
Forgive me.
I lost control.

851
01:02:50,355 --> 01:02:52,926
I had to do it.
I lost my family.

852
01:02:56,115 --> 01:02:58,925
I share your pain.

853
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:02,003
I understand your pain.

854
01:03:42,635 --> 01:03:44,524
I put my trust in you.

855
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,326
Thank you.

856
01:03:57,555 --> 01:03:58,761
We need to move now.

857
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:34,638
Get your family out!

858
01:04:35,155 --> 01:04:36,725
- Mama!
- Mia! Mia!

859
01:04:42,035 --> 01:04:43,924
Go, go, go!

860
01:04:56,235 --> 01:04:58,636
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

861
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:33,716
Mama!

862
01:06:26,795 --> 01:06:28,240
Jesus, are you all right?

863
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:31,164
Are you both all right?

864
01:06:31,235 --> 01:06:32,202
Listen to your mother.

865
01:06:35,915 --> 01:06:37,405
I have to go back.

866
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,640
Yes. Go.

867
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,275
Come on, let's go! Let's move! Move...

868
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:48,483
- I can't. I gotta go back!
- What?

869
01:06:48,915 --> 01:06:49,882
He has to go back.

870
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:51,605
He has to help
them or else they'll die.

871
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:52,835
He must not go back up there.

872
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:54,719
Please, please, take care of my family.

873
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:57,236
If something happens to you,
the truth will not get out.

874
01:06:58,395 --> 01:06:59,920
She has truth.

875
01:07:02,795 --> 01:07:04,718
Keep moving downhill.

876
01:07:05,595 --> 01:07:07,757
- Jesus!
- Mama!

877
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,286
It's okay, it's okay.

878
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:46,360
Here you go. You ready?

879
01:07:46,435 --> 01:07:47,402
Yes.

880
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,237
- Shoot to kill. Got it?
- Yes.

881
01:08:00,315 --> 01:08:02,124
Wait for my first shot.

882
01:08:56,355 --> 01:08:58,596
Okay, get them out of here!
Get them out of here!

883
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:10,082
Francisco! Your family, let's go!

884
01:09:10,675 --> 01:09:11,961
Let's move!

885
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:15,366
Francisco, we gotta move!

886
01:10:04,235 --> 01:10:06,203
It's all clear up there.

887
01:10:06,355 --> 01:10:09,086
Okay? Rest up a little, lie down.

888
01:10:17,195 --> 01:10:18,720
Francisco.

889
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,004
May I sit for a moment?

890
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:22,721
Of course.

891
01:10:39,795 --> 01:10:41,843
There's something you need to know.

892
01:10:44,795 --> 01:10:45,876
What?

893
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:52,283
I worked for the CIA in South America.

894
01:10:55,675 --> 01:10:56,836
I see.

895
01:10:57,755 --> 01:11:00,998
I'm the man responsible
for sending you to prison.

896
01:11:09,275 --> 01:11:10,686
Well, then...

897
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,126
I'm indebted to you.

898
01:11:16,915 --> 01:11:18,485
I don't understand.

899
01:11:20,675 --> 01:11:25,602
When I went to prison,
it changed the way I thought.

900
01:11:27,435 --> 01:11:29,403
I wrote this book, <i>Presence is Born.</i>

901
01:11:30,635 --> 01:11:33,002
I published it under a pseudonym.

902
01:11:35,755 --> 01:11:37,837
You wrote Presence is Born?

903
01:11:38,475 --> 01:11:39,522
Yes.

904
01:11:42,355 --> 01:11:45,996
That book was very successful.
It was a best-seller.

905
01:11:47,155 --> 01:11:52,082
Yes, I gave all the rights to that
book to la Vida Campesina.

906
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,766
You regret that?

907
01:11:56,555 --> 01:11:57,636
No.

908
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:02,801
La Vida Campesina
is 150 million people strong.

909
01:12:04,035 --> 01:12:10,077
It's a movement of peasants and farmers
who are fighting,

910
01:12:10,755 --> 01:12:13,361
unlike me, peacefully,

911
01:12:14,275 --> 01:12:16,155
for the integrity
of their land and their water,

912
01:12:17,195 --> 01:12:21,484
and for the needs of all their children,
and the children to come.

913
01:12:29,995 --> 01:12:31,360
Do you have children?

914
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:35,439
I have a boy. His name is Jason.

915
01:12:43,715 --> 01:12:45,638
"You will be my son forever and ever."

916
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:48,800
I wrote that when my son was born.

917
01:13:02,675 --> 01:13:04,598
Nothing will ever change that.

918
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:08,756
Nothing.

919
01:13:09,755 --> 01:13:11,200
I'm sorry, my friend.

920
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:15,115
It was a gift.

921
01:13:18,275 --> 01:13:20,039
It was a gift to me.

922
01:13:24,995 --> 01:13:26,201
We need to move on.

923
01:14:02,635 --> 01:14:04,239
I have a vehicle waiting for us up here.

924
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:14,363
Give me your hand. Come on.

925
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:47,397
Francisco, let's go!
We have to get out of here!

926
01:14:47,475 --> 01:14:49,239
Francisco! Francisco!

927
01:15:43,955 --> 01:15:46,322
<i>The people down here regard you a hero.</i>

928
01:15:46,395 --> 01:15:48,762
<i>They call you Francisco Francis.</i>

929
01:15:49,115 --> 01:15:50,560
<i>I was born in San Francisco.</i>

930
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:54,798
<i>You received your Ph.D.
in Environmental Studies.</i>

931
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:57,355
<i>You came down here
with Greenpeace to South America,</i>

932
01:15:57,435 --> 01:16:01,281
<i>and now you're serving
11 years in a very tough prison.</i>

933
01:16:01,955 --> 01:16:03,036
<i>Yes.</i>

934
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:05,961
<i>How did you become involved
in the South American water wars</i>

935
01:16:06,035 --> 01:16:07,844
<i>that resulted in you becoming incarcerated?</i>

936
01:16:08,515 --> 01:16:10,165
How could I not get involved?

937
01:16:10,235 --> 01:16:13,637
It became illegal for farmers
to collect rain water

938
01:16:13,715 --> 01:16:17,561
because ClearBec owned
all the water rights in the whole country.

939
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:20,002
That's like saying, "I own God."

940
01:16:21,075 --> 01:16:25,763
<i>Do you have any regrets
about what you did, and being here today?</i>

941
01:16:27,555 --> 01:16:29,398
I regret the violence.

942
01:16:30,075 --> 01:16:31,486
I regret

943
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:38,280
not having enough knowledge

944
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:46,644
to make the proper choices

945
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:50,836
<i>that would have helped the people.</i>

946
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:53,360
<i>I regret that.</i>

947
01:16:56,795 --> 01:16:57,796
Hello?

948
01:16:59,475 --> 01:17:01,637
Hello, can you hear me? Hello!

949
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:04,003
Mom, it's for you.

950
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:09,045
<i>Thank you, sweetie. Thank you.</i>

951
01:17:09,915 --> 01:17:11,076
<i>Hello?</i>

952
01:17:11,435 --> 01:17:14,245
Yes, this is Jack.
I've found Francisco Francis.

953
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,719
Yes. Is... Is he...

954
01:17:20,755 --> 01:17:23,884
He's alive. Listen very carefully.

955
01:17:23,915 --> 01:17:25,917
I need you to call the number I gave you.

956
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,477
<i>Tell them there are four people coming in.</i>

957
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:31,925
I'm gonna text you the names,
confirm you receive them,

958
01:17:31,995 --> 01:17:34,362
<i>forward and delete. You got that?</i>

959
01:17:34,835 --> 01:17:35,996
And... And...

960
01:17:37,555 --> 01:17:38,556
Hello?

961
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:40,655
<i>Jack?</i>

962
01:17:47,275 --> 01:17:48,436
<i>Yes?</i>

963
01:17:48,595 --> 01:17:51,883
Well, looks like
you're gonna get your money's worth.

964
01:17:56,915 --> 01:18:01,443
When that plane lands,
we've got to prevent Begosian

965
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:05,440
from bringing Francis anywhere where he
could cause any more damage,

966
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:09,196
because, Bruce, if we
don't, we are finished.

967
01:18:11,155 --> 01:18:13,920
We've gone too far, Doug, too far.

968
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:16,638
Bruce, listen to me.

969
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:20,206
Francisco Francis has many enemies.

970
01:18:20,755 --> 01:18:24,362
Violent people
who will stop at nothing to eliminate him.

971
01:18:24,915 --> 01:18:27,077
They hired an assassin, Tor.

972
01:18:27,795 --> 01:18:32,676
The assassin will kill Jack Begosian
and Francisco Francis.

973
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:36,522
Our security will kill the assassin

974
01:18:37,155 --> 01:18:39,965
because they're there protecting Morgan.

975
01:18:41,155 --> 01:18:43,806
And Morgan will still be a liability.

976
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:57,958
Am I your enemy now, Bruce?

977
01:18:58,795 --> 01:19:00,923
No, but...

978
01:19:01,915 --> 01:19:04,156
What you're doing will
bring down ClearBec, Morgan.

979
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:07,316
Maybe ClearBec deserves
to be brought down.

980
01:19:08,155 --> 01:19:11,238
You're forgetting
all the good that we have done.

981
01:19:11,795 --> 01:19:15,845
You're forgetting those
thousands of towns and villages

982
01:19:15,915 --> 01:19:18,964
that we provided water
for that otherwise wouldn't have had it.

983
01:19:19,035 --> 01:19:21,561
You're forgetting about all the lives
of the children that we saved.

984
01:19:21,635 --> 01:19:23,046
No, I'm not.

985
01:19:23,475 --> 01:19:25,762
But I'm not forgetting
about Ecuador either.

986
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:29,125
I'm sorry that that happened, I am.

987
01:19:30,835 --> 01:19:32,755
<i>But you're forgetting
to look at the big picture.</i>

988
01:19:33,555 --> 01:19:35,683
We have to move on,
we have to move forward.

989
01:19:35,755 --> 01:19:36,881
There's just too much at stake.

990
01:19:36,915 --> 01:19:40,362
Too much what?
When is it enough, Bruce?

991
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:45,395
I can't believe that
you of all people would say that.

992
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:47,279
Do you remember
what Daddy used to say?

993
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:52,799
<i>"It's never too late
to do the right thing."</i>

994
01:19:57,435 --> 01:19:59,836
Bruce? Goldman Brothers on two.

995
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:06,881
Robert.

996
01:20:06,955 --> 01:20:08,878
<i>I thought you'd like to know you're funded.</i>

997
01:20:08,915 --> 01:20:12,840
<i>You have the $2 billion dollars
for your South African friends.</i>

998
01:20:13,315 --> 01:20:14,601
Thank you.

999
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,041
Yes?

1000
01:20:38,635 --> 01:20:39,841
<i>Hello?</i>

1001
01:20:40,715 --> 01:20:42,126
Are you there?

1002
01:20:45,155 --> 01:20:46,645
We're funded.

1003
01:20:47,995 --> 01:20:49,804
What do you want me to do, Bruce?

1004
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:53,684
<i>What about your sister?</i>

1005
01:20:56,195 --> 01:20:59,802
What do you want me to do
about Morgan, Bruce?

1006
01:21:05,315 --> 01:21:06,396
<i>Okay.</i>

1007
01:21:40,075 --> 01:21:43,602
<i>We'll pinch them just past the
clock tower outside the airport.</i>

1008
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:47,718
<i>Tor, you'll take
the kill shots from the roof.</i>

1009
01:21:51,355 --> 01:21:53,676
Okay. We gotta get out of here.

1010
01:22:03,035 --> 01:22:04,844
- How was your flight?
- Pretty good, thank you.

1011
01:22:04,915 --> 01:22:06,519
Good. You owe me one, Jack.

1012
01:22:06,595 --> 01:22:07,562
Yes, sir.

1013
01:22:09,075 --> 01:22:14,081
<i>Our subjects are Begosian,
Francis, and Morgan Swinton...</i>

1014
01:22:20,955 --> 01:22:22,286
They're on their way.

1015
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,397
Got it. We're green.

1016
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:28,758
Everyone, we're green.

1017
01:22:44,195 --> 01:22:45,845
Go to the roof.

1018
01:22:46,035 --> 01:22:49,118
When Tor takes them out,
I need you to kill him.

1019
01:22:50,155 --> 01:22:53,477
Plant this cell phone on him,
there's 43 calls to Aguila.

1020
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,279
That should be
a good enough connection.

1021
01:22:55,355 --> 01:22:56,720
- Yeah.
- Go.

1022
01:23:58,715 --> 01:24:00,683
Is this your service, Jack?

1023
01:24:00,755 --> 01:24:02,723
Is this your mission?

1024
01:24:02,795 --> 01:24:04,285
I guess you can call it that.

1025
01:24:11,275 --> 01:24:14,836
<i>Tor... Jack Begosian. Take the shot.</i>

1026
01:24:17,195 --> 01:24:18,959
<i>Tor, take the shot.</i>

1027
01:24:21,315 --> 01:24:22,805
Tor, take the shot.

1028
01:24:23,595 --> 01:24:25,518
<i>What the hell's going on? Take the shot.</i>

1029
01:24:29,195 --> 01:24:30,799
<i>Tor, take the shot.</i>

1030
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,684
Ecuador, Ecuador, Ecuador!

1031
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:40,645
Everybody, down!
Everybody, down!

1032
01:24:56,275 --> 01:24:58,801
Tor has turned.
I repeat, Tor has turned!

1033
01:24:58,875 --> 01:24:59,922
<i>Ven, take him out!</i>

1034
01:25:02,675 --> 01:25:04,518
Stay down, stay down, stay down!

1035
01:25:09,315 --> 01:25:10,726
Take your family out!

1036
01:25:16,635 --> 01:25:18,558
No! Francisco!

1037
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:20,762
No!

1038
01:26:01,475 --> 01:26:02,715
Calder, you son-of-a-bitch!

1039
01:26:11,155 --> 01:26:12,839
Everybody, out! Let's go, go!

1040
01:26:15,915 --> 01:26:19,203
Let's go! Go, go, go!

1041
01:26:21,515 --> 01:26:24,519
Get in! Get in, quick!

1042
01:26:25,395 --> 01:26:28,399
I got it! Let's go!

1043
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:44,995
These are the pledge holder agreements.

1044
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,440
<i>- I'll get Raymond to notarize.
- Just get out.</i>

1045
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:47,875
And Goldman wants to be included...

1046
01:26:47,955 --> 01:26:49,241
Get out!

1047
01:26:49,315 --> 01:26:50,726
<i>...Front Street, amateur footage...</i>

1048
01:27:01,275 --> 01:27:02,686
<i>...armed with automatic weapons,</i>

1049
01:27:02,755 --> 01:27:05,804
<i>began a gun battle after a
near-collision between two vehicles...</i>

1050
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:06,876
Yes?

1051
01:27:08,155 --> 01:27:10,044
Bruce, this is salvageable.

1052
01:27:10,075 --> 01:27:13,477
Francis is the only one whose testimony
can possibly hurt us in court.

1053
01:27:13,915 --> 01:27:16,759
<i>He's in the hospital.
I will personally pay him a visit.</i>

1054
01:27:17,035 --> 01:27:19,276
This is not acceptable, Doug!

1055
01:27:19,395 --> 01:27:25,516
Bruce, I will protect our company,
our employees, our shareholders, and you.

1056
01:27:25,955 --> 01:27:27,923
<i>I will fix this.</i>

1057
01:27:31,755 --> 01:27:34,725
<i>Francisco Francis, an eco-terrorist...</i>

1058
01:27:35,115 --> 01:27:36,924
As the majority shareholder
in ClearBec,

1059
01:27:36,995 --> 01:27:39,282
I promise a full investigation
into what happened in Ecuador.

1060
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:40,641
Thank you. Thank you, all.

1061
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:42,797
Go. I'll talk to you later.

1062
01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:03,919
Black, no sugar.

1063
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:07,196
You listened well.

1064
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:09,236
Thank you.

1065
01:28:10,955 --> 01:28:12,081
Why'd you do it?

1066
01:28:13,595 --> 01:28:16,724
It's hard to find good
radio talk show hosts these days.

1067
01:28:20,155 --> 01:28:23,637
The wind, it blew in your favor, Jack.

1068
01:28:28,195 --> 01:28:30,402
You know, it's not over.

1069
01:28:32,195 --> 01:28:34,641
While Calder's still
walking around out there.

1070
01:28:37,835 --> 01:28:39,041
You call it.

1071
01:28:42,155 --> 01:28:43,156
Heads or tails?

1072
01:28:58,435 --> 01:29:02,076
Yeah, this is the account number: 3714826.

1073
01:29:02,835 --> 01:29:04,678
<i>Yes, sir. How can we help you?</i>

1074
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:06,564
I need a 6-5, please.

1075
01:29:06,635 --> 01:29:08,125
<i>Departing when, sir?</i>

1076
01:29:08,355 --> 01:29:11,723
It should be ready
for wheels up in about three hours.

1077
01:29:14,475 --> 01:29:15,920
<i>Yes, sir. Destination?</i>

1078
01:29:19,275 --> 01:29:20,845
I'll call back.

1079
01:29:57,995 --> 01:29:59,599
What the hell?

1080
01:30:15,715 --> 01:30:18,161
A golf bag, really?

1081
01:30:23,995 --> 01:30:26,566
You think we can't handle this, Jack?

1082
01:30:28,075 --> 01:30:30,806
There are a thousand ways to spin this.

1083
01:30:31,155 --> 01:30:35,080
Francis is a terrorist.
You're lunatic fringe, Jack. You know that?

1084
01:30:35,395 --> 01:30:36,635
You hear me?

1085
01:30:37,715 --> 01:30:40,480
You made shit like this disappear
a hundred times.

1086
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:43,485
What, you think we can't?
Well, we can.

1087
01:30:44,155 --> 01:30:45,645
We can, Jack!

1088
01:30:46,355 --> 01:30:48,039
Let me tell you how this is gonna work.

1089
01:30:49,555 --> 01:30:51,364
Before your skin starts to blister,

1090
01:30:51,995 --> 01:30:54,157
you're gonna smell something.

1091
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:58,440
You're gonna smell your hair
and your eyebrows as they begin to burn.

1092
01:31:04,635 --> 01:31:06,478
Then your eyes are gonna ooze.

1093
01:31:06,955 --> 01:31:09,037
They're gonna run
like broken egg yolks.

1094
01:31:09,395 --> 01:31:13,195
I know what you did.
I saw what you did.

1095
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:15,285
You're not...

1096
01:31:15,515 --> 01:31:16,880
You...

1097
01:31:17,915 --> 01:31:20,361
You are not better than me, Jack!

1098
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:22,764
We are exactly alike!

1099
01:31:24,795 --> 01:31:27,560
Take a look at yourself, Jack!

1100
01:31:27,635 --> 01:31:29,922
We are exactly alike!

1101
01:31:30,995 --> 01:31:33,396
I know who you are!

1102
01:31:39,075 --> 01:31:41,476
<i>Excuse me, sir.
Did you say "golf bag"?</i>

1103
01:31:41,555 --> 01:31:44,240
You heard right,
in a golf bag outside the house.

1104
01:31:44,315 --> 01:31:45,965
His name is Doug Calder.

1105
01:31:46,035 --> 01:31:48,959
He's the man responsible
for the shoot-out today on Front Street.

1106
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:02,446
<i>This is Jack Begosian,</i>

1107
01:32:02,515 --> 01:32:03,955
and for those of you just tuning in,

1108
01:32:03,995 --> 01:32:07,556
you are listening to
the new daytime version of <i>The Truth.</i>

1109
01:32:07,715 --> 01:32:12,198
Today I have with me,
the great honor to have Francisco Francis,

1110
01:32:12,275 --> 01:32:14,437
the founder of La Vida Campesina movement

1111
01:32:15,355 --> 01:32:18,677
who brought to light the atrocities
committed by ClearBec in Ecuador.

1112
01:32:19,195 --> 01:32:21,402
Francisco, the floor is yours.

1113
01:32:21,715 --> 01:32:23,877
Thank you for having me, Jack.

1114
01:32:24,715 --> 01:32:28,162
The reason that the ClearBec incident
is so horrible

1115
01:32:28,755 --> 01:32:32,965
is that it exposes the lengths
to which corporate interests will go

1116
01:32:32,995 --> 01:32:34,360
in order to protect themselves.

1117
01:32:35,795 --> 01:32:36,921
Absolutely.

1118
01:32:36,995 --> 01:32:38,281
We'd like to hear your thoughts.

1119
01:32:38,355 --> 01:32:39,481
Next caller, please.

1120
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:41,478
Hello, this is Jack Begosian.
You're on the air.

1121
01:32:41,555 --> 01:32:43,603
<i>- Hi, Jack. This is Jeff.</i>
- Hello, Jeff.

1122
01:32:43,675 --> 01:32:45,115
<i>What's gonna happen to ClearBec now?</i>

1123
01:32:47,715 --> 01:32:50,924
<i>Well, Morgan Swinton
Is the major shareholder In ClearBec,</i>

1124
01:32:50,995 --> 01:32:55,080
<i>and she has promised
to pave a new moral path for the company.</i>

1125
01:32:56,395 --> 01:32:58,477
Her brother, Bruce Swinton,
has been indicted

1126
01:32:58,555 --> 01:33:00,717
for conspiracy to commit murder.

1127
01:33:00,795 --> 01:33:02,445
<i>The guy's already out on bail.</i>

1128
01:33:02,515 --> 01:33:04,085
<i>He's got all the money in the world.</i>

1129
01:33:04,155 --> 01:33:05,964
<i>You know how the system works, Jack.</i>

1130
01:33:06,035 --> 01:33:09,005
<i>No client's guilty until
they run out of money.</i>

1131
01:33:09,035 --> 01:33:11,276
Well said. Thanks for the call.

1132
01:33:11,755 --> 01:33:14,645
You know, Jack, I think
that the important thing to realize here

1133
01:33:14,675 --> 01:33:17,838
is that the water deal
in South Africa has been stopped,

1134
01:33:17,915 --> 01:33:19,644
just as it was stopped in Paraguay,

1135
01:33:19,675 --> 01:33:20,881
just as it should be stopped everywhere.

1136
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:23,475
We are talking about a natural resource,

1137
01:33:23,555 --> 01:33:24,966
a natural resource that
should be controlled

1138
01:33:25,035 --> 01:33:26,685
by the government for the people,

1139
01:33:26,755 --> 01:33:30,646
not by the private entity whose major
interests are to maximize profit.

1140
01:33:30,715 --> 01:33:36,040
We have individuals who can't even
afford to buy a piece of bread,

1141
01:33:36,115 --> 01:33:40,962
and now they won't even be able to
afford drinking a glass of water.

1142
01:33:42,475 --> 01:33:43,761
This is something that cannot occur.

1143
01:33:43,795 --> 01:33:45,445
This is something that we have to stop.

1144
01:33:46,155 --> 01:33:49,238
You're listening
to Francisco Francis on <i>The Truth.</i>

1145
01:33:49,755 --> 01:33:51,166
Next caller.

1146
01:33:51,435 --> 01:33:54,405
<i>I just want to know
what the hell makes people like Swinton</i>

1147
01:33:54,475 --> 01:33:56,876
<i>step over the line the way he did.</i>

1148
01:33:58,515 --> 01:34:01,678
We all have demons, each of us.

1149
01:34:03,115 --> 01:34:04,924
<i>Come on! Bruce Swinton was greedy!</i>

1150
01:34:04,955 --> 01:34:07,117
<i>He just wanted more and more.</i>

1151
01:34:14,635 --> 01:34:18,401
It's not only about greed.
It's about many things.

1152
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:22,436
Fear, selfishness...

1153
01:34:22,755 --> 01:34:24,678
<i>Are you excusing him, Jack?
Is that what you're doing?</i>

1154
01:34:24,755 --> 01:34:28,840
It's just not that simple. I'm not
defending him, I'm not excusing him,

1155
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,877
nor am I excusing myself.

1156
01:34:33,635 --> 01:34:38,084
You know, Jack, sometimes we do things

1157
01:34:39,355 --> 01:34:40,916
that are difficult for us to let go of,

1158
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:46,966
<i>surrendering control, even of the thought
that we can judge or forgive ourselves.</i>

1159
01:34:47,195 --> 01:34:49,402
All the things we've done,
the things we carry in our past,

1160
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,558
they only add up to this moment.

1161
01:34:57,075 --> 01:34:58,201
Hi.

1162
01:35:01,315 --> 01:35:02,805
Where are you?

1163
01:35:04,475 --> 01:35:05,681
I'm at the lake house.

1164
01:35:05,915 --> 01:35:10,637
Even violence, non-violence itself
is not the absence of fighting the enemy.

1165
01:35:11,435 --> 01:35:15,997
It's the ability to fight the deeds
of the enemy, not the human being.

1166
01:35:18,075 --> 01:35:19,315
The lake house?

1167
01:35:19,635 --> 01:35:22,161
And I know that what you have done

1168
01:35:23,715 --> 01:35:27,925
has opened up a road
to save thousands and thousands of people.

1169
01:35:28,675 --> 01:35:31,804
God, we used to come here a lot
when we were kids, didn't we?

1170
01:35:34,715 --> 01:35:35,841
Yeah.

1171
01:35:37,795 --> 01:35:41,163
It's a little chilly, but
it's beautiful as ever.

1172
01:35:42,915 --> 01:35:44,724
<i>You taught me how to swim there.</i>

1173
01:35:44,795 --> 01:35:51,599
You brought light
to a situation that was in the dark.

1174
01:35:58,035 --> 01:35:59,161
Bruce, I'm on my way.

1175
01:35:59,395 --> 01:36:02,842
You've saved countless amounts of people

1176
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:06,402
and for that I'm very,
very thankful to you, Jack Begosian.

1177
01:36:07,275 --> 01:36:08,561
<i>Morgan...</i>

1178
01:36:10,155 --> 01:36:11,156
<i>Yeah?</i>

1179
01:36:11,995 --> 01:36:13,042
I'm proud of you.

1180
01:36:14,355 --> 01:36:15,481
Don't...

1181
01:36:19,995 --> 01:36:20,996
Bruce?

1182
01:36:42,075 --> 01:36:45,284
At the end of the day
all we can do is search for the truth,

1183
01:36:45,355 --> 01:36:48,086
learn from it
and most importantly, defend it.

1184
01:36:50,955 --> 01:36:54,402
So on behalf of myself
and Francisco Francis,

1185
01:36:54,755 --> 01:36:58,043
I am Jack Begosian
and you are listening to <i>The Truth.</i>

1186
01:36:58,795 --> 01:37:01,196
Good night, and make it a good day.

1187
01:37:05,435 --> 01:37:07,244
- Thanks for having me.
- All right.

1188
01:37:09,315 --> 01:37:12,239
<i>I, myself, I'm going home and that's...</i>

1189
01:37:12,435 --> 01:37:14,199
<i>That's a good place to start.</i>

1190
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:26,481
<i>Beyond the ideas of wrong-doings
and right-doings is a field.</i>

1191
01:38:28,995 --> 01:38:30,759
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>
