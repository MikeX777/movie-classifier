1
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,969
Come here.

2
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,763
Yeah.

3
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,473
Good boy.

4
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,940
Evening, sir.

5
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,835
Watch me.

6
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,504
Watch him.

7
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,050
Just do it! Kill him!

8
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,390
We're the competition.

9
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,725
Good evening, sir.

10
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,113
Sit.

11
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,289
Release your dogs!

12
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,559
Eddie...huh? Hey.

13
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,943
Eddie.

14
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,571
Yo.

15
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,781
Eddie.

16
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,075
I don't think
he's listening.

17
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,493
Eddie?

18
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,344
Why don't I hold
onto that for you.

19
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,978
Whole precinct's
out there.

20
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,231
But they're looking
for four guys in
a Cadillac.

21
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,609
We can split up
the money, just
go solo on foot.

22
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,112
You got
a 200-pound mag drill
in your back pocket

23
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,239
you been holding
and not telling
us about?

24
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,449
The car is hidden from
the street unless
they get close,

25
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,161
but we're sitting ducks
down here if they do.

26
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,720
Municipal storage facility.

27
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,643
Anyone with a car
owe you a favor?

28
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,562
Short notice,
short money?

29
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,647
Not in my Rolodex.

30
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,941
What the fuck's
a Rolodex?

31
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,152
Don't talk
for a while,
okay?

32
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,493
Watch yourself.
A lot further
to fall.

33
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,414
Car troubles.

34
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,916
Yeah.

35
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,337
Wild card came
up a deuce.

36
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,215
Take us a day
to crack it.

37
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,759
I can make you
whole then.

38
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,680
Right.
Right.

39
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,184
What'd he say?

40
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,852
He said
we're all
over the news.

41
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,188
Told us
we're on our own
till nightfall at best,

42
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,358
and that he'd
need at least
50% hazard pay

43
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,735
to think about
sticking his
neck out.

44
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,029
He said, "Call back
an hour before
sundown."

45
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,405
He'll know if he
can send
a van,

46
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,032
if it's cooled
off by then.

47
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,117
Fucking sundown?

48
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,704
What?

49
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,416
You stupid
piece of shit.

50
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,834
No one told me
there was alarms.

51
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,544
Yeah, that wouldn't
have mattered

52
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,088
if you stuck
with the fucking safe

53
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,632
instead of making
a detour to the
pharmacy section

54
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,842
on your own initiative.

55
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,052
I saw an in,
I took it.

56
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,388
Look, I can--
I can flip dope.
That's good loot.

57
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,597
You fucked us!

58
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,349
No.
We should
have had pieces.

59
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,310
Pieces? This
was a soft in,
soft out.

60
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,686
This is
no guns needed.

61
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,730
This is candy
from a baby.

62
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,482
You going
to shoot a cop?

63
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,234
I don't know
who I'm going
to shoot.

64
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,569
You watch that.

65
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,154
Look, we
got the safe
and we got out.

66
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,447
That's a fucking
score.

67
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,657
Oh, yeah.
Why don't
you tell

68
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,075
that to our
wheelman's wife?

69
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,910
I'm sure she'll be
very proud of us.

70
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,620
Maybe you give her
a couple hundred
from your cut

71
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,788
for the casket.

72
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,832
Yeah, I--
I didn't need
to bring you in.

73
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,293
To your low-rent
box store job?
Huh?

74
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,963
We'll be lucky if we pull
30K from this shit-show.

75
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,091
If you even give us
a chance to fucking
crack this safe.

76
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,926
Thanks for
the lead, ace.

77
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,594
Fuck you.

78
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,264
Fuck, you're stupider
than your fucking cousin.

79
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,307
Morons.

80
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,934
What?

81
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,856
What the fuck?

82
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,315
He's sick.

83
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,695
Christ.

84
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,321
What the fuck
would you know?

85
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,990
Son, I've spilled
more dope

86
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,242
than you'll ever
live to shoot.

87
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,289
Look, I...

88
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,208
I just didn't have
my wake-up this
morning, all right?

89
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,626
So you figured
you'd nab one

90
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,795
while we were
on the clock?

91
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,802
Just let me
get well.

92
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,637
All right?

93
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,016
Come on, man.
It's...

94
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,896
Your show.

95
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,778
I should let you
fucking sweat it.

96
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,822
It's the small bottle.
It's yellow powder.

97
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,324
Yeah.

98
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,910
They got a sink
in here?

99
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,995
Have we been here
longer than you have?

100
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,580
Yeah, whatever.

101
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,418
Stay away from
the street-side windows.

102
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,881
And don't go
the fuck outside.

103
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,887
Ah, f...

104
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,146
You said this was
going to be easy.

105
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,856
Come on.
Almost there.

106
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,886
STACY, OFF:
<i>Sometimes I pretend
the sounds of cars passing by</i>

107
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>are waves
on some little black sand
beach, far away from here.</i>

108
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,526
GRACE, OFF:
<i>You don't have to pretend.</i>

109
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,736
<i>Let's fly away.</i>

110
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,250
I fucked up.

111
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,794
Taking down
rinky-dink scores

112
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,672
with punks
that can't keep their
hands out of the cookie jar

113
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,591
long enough to finish
the main course?

114
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,718
I dropped the ball, Walker.
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,428
I've seen this.

116
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,097
Guys get shaken
up, you know,
partner dies,

117
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,348
their kid gets sick.

118
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,101
Maybe their wife
balls someone else,

119
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,937
and they start making
their own chaos.
Walker--

120
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,482
There are
only three kinds
of last score, Stacy.

121
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,610
The kind where
you serve life,

122
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,653
the kind where
you're served
a bullet,

123
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,947
and the kind--
The kind where
you walk away.

124
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,700
Man's got to know
what he is.

125
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,785
Yeah?

126
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,871
What are you?

127
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:26,209
You know,
I did this score
when my kid was little.

128
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,129
Christmas Eve,
I couldn't have
been, what, 25?

129
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,173
Pet shop job.

130
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,883
I knew this guy,
he was the manager.

131
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,636
Says there's going
to be 5 grand
in the safe.

132
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,305
I guess these places
do good on holidays.

133
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,474
You know,
what with the kittens

134
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,893
and bunnies,
and all that.

135
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,979
I'm counting on this score
to put something
under the tree

136
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,650
for my little girl, so I go,
you know, I crack
this safe.

137
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,653
<i>WALKER, OFF:
It's a four-number,
mechanical combo.</i>

138
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,404
<i>Eyes and ears only.</i>

139
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,823
<i>I am so proud of myself.</i>

140
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,201
<i>I pull this thing open...</i>

141
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,787
<i>There's nothing.</i>

142
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,163
<i>Not a note.</i>

143
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,875
<i>Turns out this manager's
a fucking degenerate</i>

144
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,627
<i>like everybody else,</i>

145
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,171
<i>and he's already dropped
all the money
at the track.</i>

146
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,092
<i>Remember, my little girl</i>

147
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,344
<i>has been listening
for sleigh bells
all week,</i>

148
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,014
<i>so I go looking
for a bunny or
a cat to get her.</i>

149
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,850
<i>But all they got left
is puppies and fish.</i>

150
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,269
<i>Now, I know who'd
be walking
a puppy.</i>

151
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,065
<i>So I find this fish.</i>

152
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,484
<i>Tropical one.</i>

153
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,527
<i>Beautiful.</i>

154
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,696
<i>Bright yellow.</i>

155
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,699
<i>Different than the others.</i>

156
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,867
<i>Perfect.</i>

157
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,953
<i>I grab the whole tank.</i>

158
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,373
<i>Must've weighed 60 pounds,
cord hanging off the back.</i>

159
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,041
<i>And I'm about to take off.</i>

160
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,543
<i>And I stop and think,</i>

161
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,545
<i>"Am I really about
to walk out of a job</i>

162
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,880
<i>with one goddamned fish?"</i>

163
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,549
<i>So I go fishing.</i>

164
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,300
<i>Long shrimp-looking ones,</i>

165
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,010
<i>leopard-type guys,</i>

166
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,722
<i>big old black ones
with those big bubble eyes.</i>

167
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,725
<i>Just dropping them
in the tank
with Yellow.</i>

168
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,060
<i>I'm pretty happy
how this worked
out, you know?</i>

169
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,312
<i>I never
would've come up
with this on my own.</i>

170
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,689
<i>It would've been
a teddy bear,</i>

171
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,566
<i>or a doll if I was
really flush.</i>

172
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,736
<i>But this,
this is inspired.</i>

173
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:19,573
<i>So I slip in, I set up this
tank right under the tree,</i>

174
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,825
<i>because I just got to see
the look on my daughter's face</i>

175
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,368
<i>when she sees this.</i>

176
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,246
<i>But lugging
that aquarium
around is hard work.</i>

177
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,332
<i>I'm out as soon
as I hit the chair.</i>

178
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,587
<i>Then I wake up,
and there's this
screaming.</i>

179
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,048
<i>Nothing like that sound.</i>

180
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,926
<i>Sound of your own kid,
just screaming.</i>

181
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,267
All these fish are dead.

182
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,730
<i>All bloated up
like some East
River dump job.</i>

183
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,275
<i>All except
that yellow tropical.</i>

184
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,736
Turns out

185
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,697
that freshwater fish
don't make it
in the salt.

186
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,577
Me, I'm a freshwater fish.

187
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,621
I know I'm in
the right tank.

188
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,127
Maybe we should go check
on that kid before he,
you know,

189
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,046
takes a selfie
up on the roof.

190
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,381
Posts it
to Instagram.

191
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,468
Fuck.

192
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,895
Fuck you.

193
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,792
Testost-- Fuck.

194
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,167
Shame.

195
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,796
He's finished.

196
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,723
I'll handle it.

197
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,350
We'll be back
for the count.

198
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,314
Come on.

199
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,865
Up.

200
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,867
Stay.

201
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,023
Fuck!

202
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,731
Fuck.

203
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,565
Walk away.

204
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,358
Nice and slow.

205
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,583
Shit. Run!

206
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,003
Go! Run!
Jesus! Fuck! Shit.

207
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,546
Holy fuck.

208
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,089
- My fucking luck.
- Go!

209
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,301
It's coming!

210
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,511
Shut the fucking door.

211
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,104
What the fuck
was that?

212
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,275
Beware of still water
or a silent dog.

213
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,572
You know, I bunked
with this gangbanger.

214
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,033
He used
to fight pits
in Chicago.

215
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,036
So, this guy,
he tells me,
the big organizations,

216
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,496
they hop
from place
to place,

217
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,540
and that someone
sticks around

218
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,500
to put the losers down
when the show is over.

219
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:10,919
There's a fire escape.

220
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,545
Well, let's get
the fuck out of here.

221
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,005
Come back
for the money.

222
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,256
Ride knows
where we're at.

223
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,383
We got to be here
when he comes,

224
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,968
otherwise he takes
the safe,

225
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,554
he tells us it's
in an evidence
room downtown,

226
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,389
we don't see
a fucking dime.

227
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,309
All right,
we hole up here
till the van comes.

228
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,061
Bust out the window
and take the stairs.

229
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,812
Get the safe.
Oh, fuck.

230
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,106
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

231
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,198
What the hell
do you think
you're doing?

232
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,491
I'm fucking sick.

233
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,451
And?
And my dope's
in the other room.

234
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,453
Did you...?

235
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,581
Did we not
almost get eaten
by a giant fucking dog?

236
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,584
Jesus, man.

237
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,336
- Fuck you.
- Hey.

238
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,923
Calm down.
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

239
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,301
You broke
my fucking nose.

240
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,136
I should've
thrown you out
of the fucking car,

241
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,388
is what I
should have done.

242
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,603
Jesus Christ.
See, now I feel bad.

243
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,648
And he was going
for you.

244
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,609
Jesus.

245
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,153
Just try and get in between
a junkie and his stuff.

246
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,531
Fucking hell.
Walker.

247
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,714
Jesus.

248
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,641
Said you had him
six months now?

249
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,018
Mm-hmm.

250
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,645
Been letting
my little niece
play with him.

251
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,482
You making
a pet?

252
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,401
Could do it.

253
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,322
Big paws.

254
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,698
Mm-hmm.

255
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,200
Raise him right,
could be a wrecker.

256
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,494
If he's game.

257
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,498
You going
to roll him?

258
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,501
Only way
to know.

259
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,176
I'll start
to work.

260
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,931
You think I'm
helping you carry

261
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,683
that kid down
that fire escape,

262
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,602
you're out
of your fucking mind.

263
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,937
I can fucking
carry him.

264
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,648
Bet you wish we
had pieces now.

265
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,442
Listen, man,
I've done
plenty of dirt,

266
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,985
but I ain't shooting
no fucking dog.

267
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,197
This shit's
funny to you?

268
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,950
Well, it's just
that I've always known
you to be a cat person.

269
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,744
Fuck you.

270
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,621
Back at you.

271
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,208
I'm not.

272
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,584
Not, what?

273
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,544
I'm not
a cat person.

274
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,546
You just switched?

275
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,092
I like cats.
I still like them.

276
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,220
I just--
I got a preference
for dogs now, that's all.

277
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,555
It's all right
to be a cat person.

278
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,099
I know it is.

279
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,101
I mean, they're smart,
they're independent,

280
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,144
you don't have
to pick up
their shit.

281
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:20,066
I just--You know,
I had a thing happen
on a job that,

282
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,735
you know,
made me re-think
the thing. That's all.

283
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,738
You had
another dog thing
happen on a job?

284
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,658
Long story.

285
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,994
Yeah, well, it's not like
we have a paucity
of time.

286
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,581
It's personal.

287
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,750
What kind of job?

288
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,919
I told you,
it's personal.

289
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,921
Listen, you know,

290
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,464
being a cat person
doesn't necessarily

291
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,425
make you
less of a man.

292
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,218
Will you stop?
You had to be there.

293
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,803
I mean,
it doesn't
make you,

294
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,680
like, a giant pussy.

295
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,765
Truffles.

296
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,726
It was a truffles job.

297
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,855
Truffles...truffles,
like chocolates?

298
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,940
No, like mushrooms.

299
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,317
The fuck-- You did
a mushroom job?

300
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,528
Not mushrooms.
Truffles.

301
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,071
What the fuck?

302
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,739
Are you fucking
kidding me?

303
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,450
I'm serious.

304
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,702
I mean, figured
dope boys get, what,

305
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,205
18K for a key
of blow?

306
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,126
A kilo of White Alba's
will get you a hundred
fucking K.

307
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,544
Fuck.

308
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,630
How did you get
plugged in with
that?

309
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:28,176
I knew this crazy kid
from East Boston.

310
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,304
Used to work
in the kitchen
with me in the joint.

311
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,891
Pretty good chef
when he wasn't
robbing armored cars.

312
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,603
I finished my stint,
I get out,

313
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:42,315
this guy is in <i>Gourmet</i>
fucking magazine.

314
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,192
Ah, and he
needs truffles.

315
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,819
Yeah. Fifty cents
on the dollar.

316
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,281
But where the fuck
is the product?

317
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,451
It's in the ground.
You got to dig it up.

318
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,870
Except he tells me
about this auction

319
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,498
that they hold
once a year, right?

320
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,167
The fucking thing
is simulcast,

321
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,962
Florence,
London, Macau.

322
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,464
Sold.

323
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,132
STACY, OFF:
<i>Now, these things
get brought</i>

324
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,801
<i>in the country chained
to some ex-Mossad's wrist.</i>

325
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,720
<i>High security.</i>

326
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,388
<i>But the guy that runs
the auction decides</i>

327
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,015
<i>he's going to cut costs.</i>

328
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,725
<i>Puts them in a regular
old storage unit</i>

329
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,310
<i>right here in town.</i>

330
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,770
<i>I case the place.</i>

331
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,480
<i>There's only one guard
on night shift.</i>

332
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,524
<i>Poor bastard humps mail
all day for the post office,</i>

333
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,025
<i>so he's out
like a light</i>

334
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,527
<i>soon as the guy
before him
takes off.</i>

335
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,654
<i>But I can't
for the life
of me figure out</i>

336
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,239
<i>what unit
these truffles are in.</i>

337
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,366
<i>I get this methed-out
Bulgarian hacker,</i>

338
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,243
<i>dresses like
Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

339
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,869
<i>to try and check
client records for me.</i>

340
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,038
<i>No dice, man.
Place is old-school.</i>

341
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,333
<i>Strictly paper files.</i>

342
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,253
<i>I pull a favor
with Mr. Clean
and borrow a truck.</i>

343
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,088
<i>I start digging
through this place's trash</i>

344
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,966
<i>for billing statements,
invoices, credit
card receipts,</i>

345
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,510
<i>anything I can find
to track these
things down.</i>

346
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,595
<i>But this place
shares an alley
with a Korean fish market,</i>

347
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,806
<i>and the only thing
I'm going to get out
of these Dumpsters</i>

348
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,350
<i>is fucking cholera.</i>

349
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,727
<i>I tell the chef
I'm throwing in
the towel.</i>

350
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,230
<i>I mean, this place
is 12 floors,
50 units each.</i>

351
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,607
<i>But he begs me
to stay on.</i>

352
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,069
<i>Tells me
he's going to pay me
70 cents on the dollar.</i>

353
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,196
<i>So I do
a little research,</i>

354
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,532
<i>find out
about this guy
in New Jersey.</i>

355
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,534
<i>Crazy South African
living in a shack</i>

356
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,286
<i>way out
in the Pine Barrens.</i>

357
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,038
<i>Got that disease
where he's got
no hair on his body.</i>

358
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,708
<i>He trains truffle dogs.</i>

359
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,001
<i>Truffle dogs?</i>

360
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,335
Yeah, well,
they're better
than pigs

361
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,296
because pigs eat
the things.

362
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,672
Dogs will just dig
them up,

363
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,174
as long as you've got food
they like better on standby.

364
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,884
Makes sense.

365
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,720
<i>Turns out there's
only a handful</i>

366
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,056
<i>of real deal ace truffle dogs
in the whole fucking country,</i>

367
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,934
<i>and this guy
owns two.</i>

368
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,645
<i>Now, as you know,
at the time, I haven't
yet cultivated</i>

369
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,689
<i>an appreciation
for the canine species,</i>

370
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,983
<i>but I'm looking at this
little Jack Russell
and I'm thinking,</i>

371
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,860
<i>maybe I can make
this work.</i>

372
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,778
<i>Get one of those
carrying cases,</i>

373
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,739
<i>like what's-her-name
with the sex video?</i>

374
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,616
<i>Sneak him
right into the place
and sniff the shit out.</i>

375
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,242
Whoa.

376
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,578
<i>This little bastard
must smell my cat
or something,</i>

377
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,288
<i>because he won't even
let me get near him.</i>

378
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,789
That ain't going
to work.

379
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,625
<i>So I have to take
the other one.</i>

380
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,959
<i>Wait,
there's another one?</i>

381
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,377
<i>Yeah,
I already told you.</i>

382
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,754
<i>This guy's got
two of these things.</i>

383
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,297
<i>Keeps the second one
in a big-ass cage</i>

384
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,840
<i>he's got built out back,</i>

385
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,759
<i>because he says
it ain't housebroken yet.</i>

386
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,470
<i>He's got
a big-ass cage
for a Jack Russell?</i>

387
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,096
<i>No, man.</i>

388
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,390
<i>What is it,
a hound
or something?</i>

389
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,725
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

390
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,646
<i>Goddamn standard poodle.</i>

391
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,481
<i>Haircut and everything.</i>

392
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,982
<i>We cover nine floors,</i>

393
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,525
<i>and old boy
is doing his thing,</i>

394
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,486
<i>but he's not getting
any hits.</i>

395
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,154
<i>At this point
I'm getting
nervous, you know,</i>

396
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,822
<i>because the morning crew
is going to relieve</i>

397
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,908
<i>Sleeping Beauty
in half an hour,</i>

398
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,743
<i>and Pom-Poms
ain't seeing shit.</i>

399
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,996
<i>And just
when I'm starting
to think I got conned...</i>

400
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,842
<i>it's all there.</i>

401
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,012
<i>The goddamn
truffle mother lode.</i>

402
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,889
Come on.

403
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,726
<i>So I give Pom-Poms
his reward,</i>

404
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,270
I start loading
these things
out into the hall.

405
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,942
And there's
Sleeping Beauty.

406
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,944
<i>I don't know what must've
happened to this guy</i>

407
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,278
<i>at the post office that day,</i>

408
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,030
<i>but the way
he's looking at me,</i>

409
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,074
<i>I can just tell he's getting
ready to put me down.</i>

410
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,826
I mean, I can do
a stretch just fine,

411
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,119
but the prospect
of getting killed

412
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,370
over a bunch
of mushrooms?

413
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,122
Truffles.

414
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,041
Whatever.
It's not sitting right.

415
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,043
So I start praying
to God.

416
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,713
<i>And the damndest
thing happens.</i>

417
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,841
<i>I mean, if I'd
have pulled
two.45s,</i>

418
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,551
<i>this guy wouldn't
have thought twice</i>

419
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,803
<i>about peeling
my scalp back
right then and there.</i>

420
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,432
<i>But this mailman...</i>

421
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,017
he sees a dog

422
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,729
and he's
in the wind.

423
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,231
Come on.
That's bullshit.

424
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,983
On my life, man.

425
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,152
Took old boy
straight to the groomers,

426
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,113
dropped $200 getting
his pom-pom fluffed.

427
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,824
Been a dog lover
ever since.

428
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,914
What the shit?

429
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,966
Fucking kid.

430
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,291
Kid!

431
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,088
Kid!

432
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,969
Nothing.

433
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,774
What is it?

434
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,452
Dispatch, this is K-309.

435
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,204
Checking out the municipal
storage facility,

436
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,455
Conrad and Gardener.

437
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,290
<i>Copy unit K9.</i>

438
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,626
Oh, fuck.

439
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,599
Got a jimmied door here.

440
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,768
Possible signs
of forced entry.

441
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,269
Going to let Charlie
have a sniff around.

442
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,938
<i>Copy that.</i>

443
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,941
<i>I need
an additional unit
at Conrad and Berger.</i>

444
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,151
<i>Dispatch, this is car 210
responding.</i>

445
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,529
<i>I'm about eight blocks
from Connie, on Lerner.</i>

446
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:09,613
<i>I'll head over now.</i>

447
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,031
<i>K-309,</i>

448
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,075
<i>car 210
is en route
to you now.</i>

449
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,678
They fucked us.

450
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,724
The kid fucked us.

451
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,868
<i>Be advised,
we are looking</i>

452
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,327
<i>for a late '80s
gold-colored Cadillac.</i>

453
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,288
<i>Castillo suspects
are armed.</i>

454
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,645
<i>210 is checking
the perimeter now.</i>

455
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,647
<i>Other units,
please stand by.</i>

456
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,691
Dispatch, we've got
possible activity in here.

457
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,735
Charlie's all fired up
over something.

458
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,243
Easy. Easy, easy, boy.

459
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,412
Easy, easy.
Good boy, Charlie.

460
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,248
Good boy. It's okay.
Who's a good boy?

461
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,375
You're a good boy.
You're good.

462
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,585
Hey, good boy.

463
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,420
Good boy, Charlie.
Good boy.

464
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:51,381
Who's a little boy?
Good boy, Charlie.

465
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,175
You're a good boy,
Charlie.

466
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,895
<i>210, we're all
clear in there.</i>

467
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,272
<i>Just Charlie
chasing his tail again.</i>

468
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,941
Copy that.

469
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,604
Let me in.

470
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,992
What about the dog?

471
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,870
It's out here playing
Frisbee with me.

472
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,663
<i>The thing was half dead
to begin with.</i>

473
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,248
<i>Let me the fuck in.</i>

474
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,212
Are you rearranging
the fucking furniture?

475
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,340
<i>Look, there's
a van downstairs</i>

476
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,342
<i>in a loading dock.</i>

477
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,555
I bet you my whole share
the key's sitting right there

478
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,599
in the dead guy's
fucking pocket.

479
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,868
Okay, let me
the fuck in.

480
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,373
You pull that shit again,
you're going to stay
out there.

481
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,125
Yeah, whatever.

482
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,547
Fuck!

483
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,425
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

484
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,771
Fuck!

485
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,358
Hey!

486
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,569
Oh, fuck.

487
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,820
Oh, shit.

488
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,908
Run, man.
Go.

489
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,082
Run!

490
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,087
Fuck. Shit.

491
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,273
- Kid? You hear me?
- Look at me.

492
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,440
You okay?

493
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:56,733
- Broke a rib.
- I'll live.

494
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,819
Help me with
the fucking kid.

495
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,320
- Ah, Christ.
- Fucking shit.

496
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,072
Hang in there.

497
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,241
We'll find something
to make you
a tourniquet.

498
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,409
Okay?

499
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,789
Staunch the flow
and clean it up.

500
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,921
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

501
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,381
Come on!

502
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,801
- Come on.
- Jesus.

503
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,969
Shit.

504
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,739
Get the fuck out of here!

505
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:55,000
I got-- I got a bag
of marbles around here...

506
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,470
That's your prospect?

507
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,390
Uh-huh.
Ain't nothing
but a pup.

508
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,933
I've been working him.

509
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,560
Shit. What line
he from?

510
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,104
Scatter-bred.

511
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,523
All respect due,

512
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,317
I don't think
you want a tot
going 40 pounds uphill

513
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,402
on the Russian.

514
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,616
Do I look like
a yard boy to you?

515
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,327
No, sir.

516
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,248
Take the fucking dog
and put it in the corner.

517
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,208
Come on, boy.

518
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,497
You could call it
if it's ugly.

519
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,292
You can't.

520
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,963
Shh.

521
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:10,844
Release your dog.

522
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,046
Yeah.

523
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,299
No main cables.

524
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:52,010
Walker knows
a good doctor.

525
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,803
He came
up doing cuts
for Chuck Wepner,

526
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,472
so he's seen
a lot worse.

527
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,182
He'll get you
squared away,

528
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,143
as soon as we
get the fuck
out of here.

529
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,853
Sorry about...

530
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,273
Yeah, well...

531
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,027
sorry about your face.

532
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,990
Fucking Weeble
Wobble, man.

533
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:17,035
What the fuck's
a Weeble Wobble?

534
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,578
It's a toy.

535
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,292
Fucking Weeble Wobble,
you know?

536
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:27,045
Weeble Wobble?
Don't fall down?

537
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,798
Like-- Like a--
Like a Slinky.

538
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,387
Forget it.

539
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,936
Tournament brackets.

540
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,646
Looks like it.

541
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,278
Fucking hell.

542
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,408
What are these? Purses?

543
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,578
Note 25, 50,
100, two.

544
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,163
This is
chump change.

545
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,832
Look at this guy.

546
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,796
Was he
fighting pairs?

547
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,798
Tough motherfucker.

548
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,258
Jesus.

549
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,851
Nobody wins.

550
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,229
Jesus fuck, this
was last night.

551
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:28,607
Christ, how long
until sundown?

552
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,526
Call our ride in 50,
then get out that fire escape.

553
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,030
Yeah, well,
what say you, kid?

554
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,325
Hmm?

555
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,996
Are you a cat person,
or are you more of
a dog person?

556
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,748
Dogs.

557
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,458
I used to love
them books
when I was little

558
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,377
where they got them
acting like people.

559
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,212
You know,
driving around
in cars,

560
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,298
and making deposits
at the bank,

561
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,426
and buying ice
cream cones
and all that.

562
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:00,263
Dad kept on
having to whup my ass
for trying to talk to them.

563
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:01,681
To dogs?

564
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,475
Yeah. I'd see them
tied up outside the store,

565
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,727
and I'd ask where
they parked their trucks.

566
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,312
I always wanted one,

567
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,397
but Pops said
he could hardly
keep us fed.

568
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,525
So I had chickens
and stuff.

569
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,194
You a farm boy?

570
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,613
No, just-- Just country.

571
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:20,408
A few egg hens,
a busted-ass
old milk cow.

572
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:25,747
I found this one dog
by the side of the road
when I was 6.

573
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,669
It couldn't have been
more than a couple
years old.

574
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,671
He-- He must've got hit
by a car or something.

575
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,923
His leg was busted up
real bad.

576
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:40,053
He was a-- He was
a shepherd, I think.

577
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,980
<i>I knew
my pop wouldn't
let me keep him.</i>

578
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,857
<i>The dog catcher
would just put
him down.</i>

579
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,193
<i>So I hauled his poor ass
all the way back to this
old shack</i>

580
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,820
<i>we had out
behind our house.</i>

581
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,947
<i>And Dad was drinking
so much by then</i>

582
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,408
<i>I knew the toolshed's
the last place he'd be.</i>

583
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,660
<i>But this little dog
was crying so loud
from the pain</i>

584
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,495
<i>that first day,</i>

585
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,539
<i>I was sure he'd hear
no matter how loaded
he was.</i>

586
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,374
<i>I stayed in there
all night,</i>

587
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,042
<i>petting him
and begging
him to be quiet</i>

588
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,627
<i>till he finally
calmed down.</i>

589
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,506
<i>Started bringing
my lunches home
from school.</i>

590
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,300
<i>At first all he wanted
was that cheese
you peel off.</i>

591
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,553
<i>But a few days in
I had him grubbing
on meatballs,</i>

592
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,555
<i>and smiley face tater tots,
and chicken nuggets,</i>

593
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,391
<i>and all that,
like a regular schoolboy.</i>

594
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,768
<i>Had to clean the shit
off his fur every day,</i>

595
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,062
<i>because his leg was still
too fucked to stand up.</i>

596
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:32,939
<i>But I didn't mind.</i>

597
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,483
<i>Nobody'd ever been
that happy to see me
my whole life</i>

598
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,694
<i>as when I walked
in that room.</i>

599
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,404
<i>Tail wagging so hard
against the ground</i>

600
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,115
<i>he's kicking up dust
all over himself.</i>

601
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,870
<i>I'd hide food under my bed
to save up for
the weekends,</i>

602
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,997
<i>you know,
but it was June already.</i>

603
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,790
<i>Pretty soon
school was done.</i>

604
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,625
<i>I busted open
my piggy bank,</i>

605
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,794
<i>sold some baseball cards
I had from Christmas</i>

606
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,171
<i>and bought
him some food,</i>

607
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,339
<i>but I ran out
after a week.</i>

608
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:01,050
<i>Had to swear I wouldn't come
back to the only store in town</i>

609
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,552
<i>after I got caught
racking Alpo</i>

610
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,096
<i>to convince them
not to tell my pop.</i>

611
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,518
<i>Only one place
left to go for food.</i>

612
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,730
<i>I was having nightmares
just thinking about it.</i>

613
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:17,150
<i>But the look
on that dog's face
after a couple days,</i>

614
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,653
<i>it was like not eating
wasn't the worst
of it for him.</i>

615
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,864
<i>Like he thought
he was in trouble,
you know?</i>

616
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,741
<i>Like he thought
I was punishing
him for something,</i>

617
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,660
<i>and he couldn't figure out
what it was he did wrong.</i>

618
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,497
<i>Started to get this froth
around his lips.</i>

619
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,332
<i>Tail slowing down.</i>

620
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,919
<i>Two more days,
and it wasn't
hardly moving at all.</i>

621
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,047
<i>It got so I couldn't
stand it anymore.</i>

622
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,635
<i>Waited till late at night.</i>

623
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,553
<i>Never been so scared
in my whole life.</i>

624
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,058
<i>Took a big old
block of hamburg
from the fridge.</i>

625
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,019
<i>Buried the wrapper
with the chickens.</i>

626
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:56,856
I can still see that dog's face
when he saw me come
in with it.

627
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,026
Swear to God
he's grinning at me
just like a little kid.

628
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,945
Tears running
down his nose,

629
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,656
because he's crying
he's so happy.

630
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:09,327
<i>Next morning
I came back in
from my chores.</i>

631
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:11,955
<i>Chickens.</i>

632
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,331
<i>They must have dug it up.</i>

633
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,878
<i>I was praying
while I ran.</i>

634
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,213
<i>Like if I prayed
hard enough,</i>

635
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,714
<i>everything was going
to be okay.</i>

636
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,560
<i>My dad...</i>

637
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:36,187
<i>he was waiting for me.</i>

638
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,401
Worst part of it was,

639
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,570
dog's got
that same look
he always did

640
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,239
when he saw me
come in.

641
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,408
Like he's smiling
at me.

642
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,245
Tail just wagging away
in the dust.

643
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,882
I was stupid.

644
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,225
Stupid kid.

645
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,395
I'm really tired.

646
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,385
Yeah, well, what am I
supposed to do,

647
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:52,221
drag that
fucking safe
out of here on foot?

648
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,599
All right. Whatever.
Yeah. Yeah.

649
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,144
Thanks for
fucking nothing.

650
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,816
Still too much heat.

651
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:05,777
Said maybe tomorrow.

652
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,530
Miss January.

653
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,408
Hmm.

654
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,629
Stole her
out of my neighbor's
mailbox last week.

655
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,043
Those purses
in the other room.

656
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,421
I know, missing
a couple zeroes.

657
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,716
Somebody's coming
back for this.

658
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,593
It's a lot more
than we got
in that safe.

659
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,887
Not too much
to carry out.

660
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,180
I'll pack.

661
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,057
I'll get the kid.

662
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,690
Fuck.

663
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,902
Might be your lucky day...

664
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:43,541
Kid.

665
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:04,896
Stupid kid.

666
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:17,116
History's a rock.

667
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:20,953
Can't swim
if you're holding it.

668
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,753
Whenever you're ready.

669
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,285
I'm going to meet you
out there.

670
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,622
Couple more jobs,
then I'm on a plane.

671
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,966
I won't wait.

672
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,719
<i>Not even for you.</i>

673
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,904
STACY, OFF:
<i>I'll see you by the sea.</i>

674
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,850
Hey. Hey.

675
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,603
It's okay.
I'm all right.

676
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,313
I'm all right.

677
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:11,898
Show me.

678
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,941
I'm all right. It's--
Fucking show
me, Walker.

679
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:16,235
Fuck. I'm okay.

680
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,196
Here, look.

681
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,281
You fucking
kidding me, man?

682
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,699
What?

683
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,242
I seen a guy
in the joint

684
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,785
take a boot party
from the screws,

685
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,495
he looked
just like that.

686
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,664
Went to sleep,
he never woke up.

687
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:32,210
Fuck that. I just need
to sit for a minute, man.

688
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:37,798
What the fuck
are you doing?
I'm calling
an ambulance.

689
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:39,091
Hey.

690
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,426
What the fuck, man?

691
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,264
Solo, you get
out of here easy.

692
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,766
Just go.

693
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,726
Van.

694
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:49,936
Downstairs.

695
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,646
You heard the kid.

696
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,606
I'll go down there,
take the key off
the dead guy,

697
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,024
I'll come back,
I'll scoop you.

698
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,525
Walk through that door,
that fucking dog's

699
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,361
going to eat
you alive.
What am I
going to do,

700
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,196
sit here and watch
you bleed out into
your own gut?

701
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:03,574
No. I want you to go down
the fucking fire escape,

702
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:04,951
and walk away.
Listen, man,

703
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:06,410
people don't recover
from what you got

704
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,788
without a fucking
doctor.
Get yourself
a ticket.

705
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,790
Shut up.
Get on
a fucking plane...

706
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,792
Shut the fuck up.
...and fly
to the fucking beach.

707
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,961
What makes
you think
I didn't try?

708
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,925
Man, when I walk
past a place,

709
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,261
I clock the traffic
three blocks around.

710
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,305
How far to the street,

711
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,349
how long to the nearest
precinct.

712
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,226
Whether the roof's
softer than the walls,

713
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,770
or if can cut in
through the joint
next door.

714
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,481
I see if the floors
can support
a strongbox,

715
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,358
whether I should
load in a drill,

716
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,485
or if there's
a pick-point
strong enough

717
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,280
so I can drop the unit
into a car downstairs.

718
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,366
Been the same way
since I was

719
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,327
popping spoilers
off of Supras,

720
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,330
doing housebreaks
through doggy doors.

721
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,549
I packed
my fucking
bags, man.

722
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,347
I even bought
one of those
stupid things

723
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,517
you put on your nose
to keep the sun off.

724
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,318
But all I could think about
when it was time
to go was...

725
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,739
how long
before I blew
it all to hell.

726
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,910
So I went ahead
and pulled the pin.

727
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,501
Because why
the fuck should I
postpone the inevitable?

728
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:42,214
She's gone, Walker.

729
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,842
Five years
fucking gone.

730
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,851
And she said
she wouldn't wait.

731
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,603
All the books
you read,

732
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,356
the great romances,
like runaway trains

733
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:01,233
that roll over anything
that gets in the way.

734
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,863
Didn't you ever think
they might not just
be a fantasy?

735
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,449
You know,
that you might
be getting in the way

736
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,409
of something
that was meant to be,

737
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,912
and you're just scared
so stupid

738
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,290
you're laying on the tracks
instead of getting onboard?

739
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,629
You know, but
every once
in a while

740
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,214
even a degenerate
gambler

741
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:26,759
can tell a guy
when it's time
to cash out.

742
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,060
She said...

743
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,565
said she was going to get
a puppy when it came time

744
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,150
to settle down.

745
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,407
Told me I could pick it out
if I was ready to join her.

746
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,783
You said
you couldn't leave,

747
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,202
she said
she wouldn't wait.

748
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:56,914
But the way
the you two of you
looked at each other...

749
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,501
I think you might
both be liars.

750
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,936
We're getting
the fuck out
of here.

751
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,689
Both of us.

752
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,774
If you say so.
It's your show.

753
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:34,827
Up.

754
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,496
Sit.

755
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,347
Oh, fuck.

756
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,771
Oh, Christ.

757
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,300
Jesus.

758
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,230
Jesus.

759
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,420
Easy.

760
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,511
Easy, boy.

761
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,015
Easy.

762
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,309
Easy.

763
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,147
Easy.

764
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,857
Shit.

765
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,465
Fuck.

766
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,617
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

767
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,101
Oh, shit.

768
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,227
Aah!

769
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,072
Fuck.

770
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:44,014
Fuck.

771
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,026
Easy, now.
Easy, boy.

772
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,945
Easy.
Good.

773
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,090
We cool?

774
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,570
Walk?

775
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,282
Guess you really are
a dog person.

776
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:49,579
Let's get you up.
Come on.

777
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,841
Here, sit down.
Sit down.

778
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,097
Sit down,
all right?

779
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,479
Day we're having,
that'll be the wrong
key.

780
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:17,607
Come on, goddamn it.

781
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,447
All right.
What's behind
door number two?

782
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,121
Cops?

783
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,959
Bird's gone.

784
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:39,546
You sure you don't want
to stick around?

785
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,006
Yeah.

786
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:42,674
Right, let's do it.

787
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,472
Oh, boy.

788
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:54,269
You know,
I'm thinking
maybe I'll retire.

789
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,146
Guy once told me

790
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,898
there are only three
types of last score.

791
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:00,817
I've been wrong.

792
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,694
Okay.

793
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,237
Come on.

794
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,001
That ain't our ride.

795
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,868
Walker!

796
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:55,038
Walker.
Go!

797
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,209
Walker.

798
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:02,212
Fuck. Come on.
Come on.

799
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,507
Walker. Walker.

800
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,051
Fuck.

801
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:16,726
Fuck!

802
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,276
Oh, fuck.

803
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,656
My mother
had a garden.

804
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,868
It wasn't much more
than a sandbox, really.

805
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,871
But it was hers.

806
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,081
Bluebells growing there.

807
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,374
Beautiful.

808
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,922
Our neighbor had a dog.

809
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,799
Spanish mastiff.

810
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:14,385
Big bastard.

811
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:18,223
Did whatever the hell
he pleased.

812
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,517
Kept on coming
into the yard

813
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,686
and digging up
those bluebells.

814
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:44,666
My mom would cry
each time.

815
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:47,752
She'd go out,
try to fix the mess,

816
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,171
put it all
back together,

817
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:52,882
start fresh.

818
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:58,888
But that dog would go
and do it all over.

819
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,850
I went to talk
to the owner.

820
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:07,564
I asked him
please to keep
his pet out of our yard.

821
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:10,817
He was a big guy,
even bigger than the dog.

822
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,902
And I was just a boy.

823
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:18,825
Well, this mastiff...

824
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,830
...he went
and did it again.

825
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:27,917
And again, and again,
and again, and again.

826
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,930
So you know what I did?

827
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:45,310
I shot him.

828
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:48,521
The neighbor, I mean.

829
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,317
You see,

830
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,819
a beast cannot
be expected

831
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,988
to understand
private property.

832
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,532
But a man,
even a stupid one,

833
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:02,619
knows the difference
between mine...

834
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,788
and yours.

835
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,834
Like that bag
you got under there.

836
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:13,338
And what I'm guessing
you got inside it.

837
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:16,007
Motherfucker.

838
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,653
Shit.

839
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,039
Whoa!

840
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,524
That mastiff
I was talking about...

841
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,193
I took him in.

842
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,533
Dogs been a hobby
of mine ever since.

843
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,912
I find them fascinating.

844
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,249
As many ways
as we are different,

845
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,793
just as many
we are the same.

846
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:23,462
But here's this thing
I noticed.

847
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:27,967
An old dog been doing
something a while,

848
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,930
it becomes
almost automatic.

849
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:36,434
Like when you are making
the same drive home
every day

850
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:39,812
for 20 years,
and the car
just drives you.

851
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:45,109
Let me put it simply.

852
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,112
You know how it goes
teaching an old dog
new tricks.

853
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:52,783
What they don't tell you
is why it never sticks.

854
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:57,288
You see,
an animal been acting
a certain way for a while,

855
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,457
it gets to be
all he knows.

856
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:01,918
And even if that behavior
isn't working,

857
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,712
even if they are eating
pieces of the carpet,

858
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,256
or chewing up your shoes
and shitting out the laces

859
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:11,218
until their guts are so tied up
in knots they are half dead,

860
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:14,847
you reach
a certain point...

861
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:18,059
Well, it ain't
unheard of for a bitch

862
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:19,602
to stop eating shoes,

863
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,938
but I ain't never seen it,
myself.

864
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,982
It's not that
complicated.

865
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,652
A dog that fights
is a fighting dog.

866
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:31,405
A man that steals
is a thief.

867
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,783
You want him to stop...

868
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,204
there's only
one thing to do.

869
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:30,881
Well, look at you.

870
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:37,888
Come here, boy.

871
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:40,683
