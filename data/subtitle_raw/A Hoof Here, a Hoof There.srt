1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,650
Many, many years ago…

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,256
with the hardness of chert stone,
by breathing soaked plasma…

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,294
a human heart was born.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,017
And it started to march.

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,534
Step up, step on.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,529
Its harness was made of
pure teutonic flesh.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,369
Step up, step on.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,500
It was suffocated by sulphates.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,896
Step up, step on.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,140
The platelets were short of oxygen.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,769
We, platelets, ask for oxygen and
to slow down the drive of time!

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,092
Geez, which one forgot to turn off
the TV this time?

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,570
Who will pay for all this?

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,891
Who always gets grief for
the thing being on at night?

15
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,291
Mr. manager, what are you doing here?

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,651
I'm checking the employees' kimeteeping.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,936
Didn’t everyone here agree
to increase their efforts?

18
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,897
What will you tell me?

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,897
Well, what should I?

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,978
I had pains last night
and now I overslept.

21
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,499
- I don’t watch porn, unlike someone.
- Really!

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,891
What kind of man you take me for?

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,413
They say you’re a huge skirt chaser.

24
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,895
- Me? Who says so?
- Someone living…

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,216
Mrs. Maštálková, think hard,
who told you?

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,170
Come on now,
it’s important.

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,814
- Someone important? - The Gossip’s
being told, the water’s running.

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,136
Someone important…?

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,335
Someone important…?

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,733
Could it be someone important?

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,578
Someone important or…

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,976
Someone important?

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,290
It could mean a good deal.

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,335
Mrs. Maštálková,

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,134
You know, for such calumny…

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,209
you could well be… imprisoned!

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,373
You mean nowadays?

38
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,738
OK, let’s admit, nowadays no.

39
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,295
But in passed times… yes.

40
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,137
Man, look at this.
You’re still here, Mrs. Maštálková?

41
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,211
I’m leaving.

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,618
You got up early today.

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,530
You’re kinda pale.
Like after a sleepless night.

44
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,332
Get up!

45
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,291
Get up, I say!

46
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,893
Hey maestro! Move!

47
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,210
Damn, I besmirched myself.

48
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,289
Now, come on!

49
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,535
- An invitation to a graduation party.
- Where was it?

50
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,136
- Are we going?
- Dunno, you didn’t study…

51
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,251
You promised to
give me a lift to work.

52
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,808
I have no time now.
Have to shave…

53
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,100
So come on, lass.

54
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,891
If the kind way doesn’t work
the mean one will have to.

55
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,932
Now…

56
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,571
Here you go.

57
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,372
Put your feet away.

58
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,210
So are we going to the party?

59
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,497
I’m not sure.
Like I said, you didn’t study.

60
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,853
Promises are wrongs.

61
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,616
Geez,
this is just like marriage…

62
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,170
Another thing you’ve promised me.

63
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,170
OK, lass.

64
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,448
I’m not going to the party anyway.

65
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,410
Swear…

66
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,932
on our love.

67
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,974
I swear on our love…

68
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,331
this is beating for you only.

69
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,649
- And not for our baby?
- For our baby?

70
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,897
What do you mean?

71
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,457
Nothing.

72
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,578
So nothing?

73
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,656
You won’t give me a lift.

74
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,693
Bye then.

75
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,532
Damn.

76
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,250
One always has to worry about something.

77
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,334
Good late afternoon, Mr. Dědek.

78
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,891
When will you finally learn to
be on time to work?

79
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,534
Sorry, I wonder too.

80
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,418
Oh, you wonder?

81
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,130
We shall have a talk about it.

82
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,895
No entry, working for the director.

83
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,936
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,059
I’ve brought work for you.

85
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,490
- Those perished sheep?
- Yep. And Hlaváček wants it soon.

86
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,656
- Do you want coffee?
- Yes.

87
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,978
What are you doing?

88
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,735
Making slices macro-biotically .

89
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,299
Oh…

90
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,739
- And mineral water, if it’s cooled.
- I only have siphons here.

91
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,292
At least something.
The water is terrible anyway.

92
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,457
But beware,
bubbles are also unhealthy.

93
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,250
So what? It’s scientifically proven
anyway that we will die.

94
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,288
I’ll take a look at you…

95
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,736
At you I’ll take a look.

96
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,972
What does it remind me of?
This perhaps?

97
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,811
Here’s your drink.
I sent someone for the mineral water.

98
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,016
Well, it’s all prepared
in a kinda clumsy way,

99
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,734
- But still it seems like "VPN".
- Oh yep.

100
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,176
The new one worked on it.
She’s not skilled yet.

101
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,734
Say…

102
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,731
Today I’ll need to leave sooner.

103
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,496
You can’t, muffs need to be controlled.

104
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,290
- Damn.
- How do you do.

105
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,529
I’ve brought the mineral water.
Where should I put them?

106
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,050
To that… What’s it called?

107
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,890
Put it… I don’t—
Somewhere to that-.

108
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,292
What’s it called?
Well, put it somewhere…

109
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,299
You’re free to go,
I’ll manage here somehow.

110
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,809
Jiřina.

111
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,169
- I wanna drink!
- Have this. - Not this.

112
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,571
Two more Becherovkas, please.

113
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,652
I wanna dance.

114
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,768
Come on.

115
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,449
- May I have a dance?
- Yep.

116
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,939
Great stuff, isn’t it?

117
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,536
- Danke.
- Bitte.

118
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,500
- Sie sprechen deutsch?
- Klar. Ja, sicher.

119
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,095
Wir kennen fast
alle deutsch sprechen.

120
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,853
- Ja.
- Ja, gut.

121
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,658
Sturm und Drang,
nicht war?

122
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,573
Dichtung und Wahrheit,
mein Liebe.

123
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,252
Dichtung und Wahrheit.

124
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,653
Wait, where are you heading?

125
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,449
- Where Will Pepe invite us now?
- I’m insolvent, ladies.

126
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,610
Was machst du den hier, Mensch?

127
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,613
- Ich hab dich noch so lange nicht
gesehen. - Na ja, sehr lange.

128
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,378
Das ist mein Freund Pupi.

129
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,850
- Look, some foreigners there.
- From the west.

130
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,891
From where else, silly?

131
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,099
Schönes Mensch, nicht war?

132
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,340
Entschulding.

133
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,730
- Watch out, Jiřina’s looking for you.
- Man, we better hook it.

134
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,772
Du bist ein sehr lustiger Kerl.

135
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,335
- Speak german, I have 3 chicks here.
- Great.

136
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,100
Well, girls come on.
I have…

137
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,091
- Herzlich Willkommen!
- I introduce you to Herr Dědek.

138
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,933
- Horst Bucholz.
- This is Maruška.

139
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,930
- Kateřina. - Guten Abend.
Horst Bucholz, mein Name.

140
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,612
Where are the Germans, girls?

141
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,977
Aber das ist so
schönes Überraschung!

142
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,137
Also kann ich alle einladen
zu meinen Tisch?

143
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,649
Also gehen wir.

144
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,738
Pupi!

145
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,256
Pupi, Wait.

146
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,168
Heute Abend ist so schönes
Wetter, nicht? Donnerwetter.

147
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,060
Come on, where are you?

148
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,577
Eindringen, nicht war?

149
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,050
Is Herr Franc here?
A separé is ready for him.

150
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,655
Separé, für mich?

151
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,497
- We have to go.
- Separé.

152
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,417
But hurry up,
we can’t understand a word.

153
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,175
Never mind, we’ll make ourselves
understand, nicht war?

154
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,490
- Prosit! - Prosit!
- Prosit!

155
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,539
Come on!

156
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,210
What are you waiting for? Buzz off!

157
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,216
Bitte.

158
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,414
- Das Wein schmecken.
- Prosit!

159
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,096
- Es schmeckt gut.
- Ich auch.

160
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,979
Ich bin sehr glücklich.

161
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,095
Ich auch.

162
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,809
Danke schön.
Wie ist es tschechisch?

163
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,411
Děkuju (thanks).

164
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,618
Dě-ku-ju.

165
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,936
Das ist eine Lampe.

166
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,808
Wie ist es tschechisch?

167
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,293
Well, lampa.

168
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,055
Lampa.

169
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,578
Und das ist ein Luster.
Wie ist es tschechisch?

170
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,453
Lustr too.

171
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,535
Auch Luster.

172
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,170
Und das ist ein štokrdle.

173
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,209
Wie ist es tschechisch?

174
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,412
Štokrdle too.

175
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,779
Štokrdle Also...

176
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,171
Goddamn.

177
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,490
Das is ist kein Kruzifix.

178
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,215
- There’s gonna be a spot.
- Das ist kein Fleck.

179
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,854
Aber das sind boobs!

180
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,378
Boobs? You speak Czech?

181
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,337
What did you expect?
I’m a pure candid Czech.

182
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,610
You cheater!

183
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,011
You’re already done?

184
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,894
Man, I had no idea that
“forwards” in german is “vorwärts”.

185
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,489
I used it on him, man.

186
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,855
- Mein Blut. Pupi, harmed…
- Ruhe!

187
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,058
Das Leben ist so schön,
nicht war?

188
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,456
Heute abend und morgen
ist der Tante urlaubs Leipzig.

189
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,213
Und unsere alte Kerl
aus Karl-Marx-Stadt.

190
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,650
Mon cheri...

191
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,413
Es mir tut so leid.

192
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,850
- Does it hurt?
- No, it’s OK.

193
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,574
Wasser. Ich muss für Wasser gehen.
Ich bin gleich zurück.

194
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,498
Sitzen und warten.

195
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,374
Sit and wait. Ich bin
gleich zurück. Ich gehe für Wasser.

196
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,338
He’s probably going to the restroom.

197
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,939
Look, there's Netík.

198
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,410
- Who?
- A crazy professor.

199
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,736
A phenomenal asshole.

200
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,298
- He’s heading here.
- With his whole family.

201
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,974
- What will we do? - Let’s not give
a damn. - Sure.

202
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,612
What impertinence!

203
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,096
Válová, Přibylová,
I don’t know the third one.

204
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,377
What are you doing at our table…?
Drinking our wine!

205
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,529
Hearing the tower-clock beat,

206
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,653
we don’t give a shit.

207
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,410
And chaps drink, drink and drink…

208
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,378
Booze - nothing to lose.

209
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,934
Come here, make me disappear.

210
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,415
Drink this
to make peace.

211
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,695
Hey, stuff your love.

212
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,499
- What’s up?
- An inspection’s here.

213
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,415
- Is this all?
- Yes.

214
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,897
- What’s inside those boxes?
- Chicken too.

215
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,090
We’ll take a look later.

216
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,818
- And where’s your storeroom?
- In the back. Where else?

217
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,216
What are you doing?

218
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,371
Come on, help me.

219
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,009
If you touch me… !

220
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,932
I’m done!

221
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,291
I’m not gonna be anybody’s fool.

222
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,452
- Take your hands off!
- Pick it up immediately.

223
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,859
Bring the stuff
from the car inside!

224
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,700
That is a 55 kg surplus.

225
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,097
There's no mistake.

226
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,980
I counted it three times.

227
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,015
Mrs. Manager, stop it, will you?

228
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,770
Such a young man.

229
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,933
One would expect you
to be understanding.

230
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,730
But I understand you, don't worry.

231
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,335
But you must understand me as well.

232
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,614
So this is finished here.

233
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,415
Next-door, it’s also all written down.

234
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,056
Think he’s noticed?
Damn!

235
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,170
We’ll have to give him another one.

236
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,455
Wait.

237
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,495
Oh, what’s this?

238
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,414
- Your coat is all dirty.
- Never mind.

239
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,857
- May I? I’ll make it clean.
- No need. - I have some petrol.

240
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,938
OK, as you please.

241
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,938
- Better make it two.
- But then he’ll have three.

242
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,457
I’ll take one away from him.

243
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,018
Excuse me…

244
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,132
Don’t stay here. The chicken will
disappear before I leave.

245
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,251
Of course…

246
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,899
Mrs. Manager!

247
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,975
Come here.
Give me your signature.

248
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,648
You’ll pay a penalty for those bills.

249
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,014
And as for the chicken…

250
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,819
I hope,
you won’t cause many problems for me.

251
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,574
We’ll see,
sign it here.

252
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,210
Oh, this damned job…

253
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,215
- So can we go on?
- Sure.

254
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,779
Simultaneously, the expenditure
of forage was observed…

255
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,809
- Got it?
- A minute

256
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,610
It’s so hot here…

257
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,728
…for the production…

258
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,812
of one egg.

259
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,930
- Of what?
- Egg.

260
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,936
Or as the case may be…

261
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,011
of one kg…

262
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,657
of egg material.

263
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,498
No entry! Working for the director!

264
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,657
- Tschüss!
- Hi, What brings you here?

265
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,973
- Keep cool. What are you writing?
- A dissertation.

266
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,378
Aren’t you through with it
for a long time?

267
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,657
But this is for
the director’s daughter, see?

268
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,137
- Hanička, Could you make coffee for us?
- Sure.

269
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,932
- It’s her? Nice chick.
- Hey, watch out, will you?

270
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,740
Shit, where could the hag have put it?

271
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,975
- What makes you so nervous?
- I tried a trick with chewing gum.

272
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,818
Seems it didn’t work.

273
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,939
So I will have to do with
one thousand.

274
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,172
- How much do you earn for this work?
- Come on, it’s for the director.

275
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,216
Then I would dump it.

276
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,929
Well boy, it’s our times.

277
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,611
First I wanted to work on it
by myself. But whatever.

278
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,618
It’ll help the girl to get through.
And me as well.

279
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,971
- Have a cigarette?
- Yep.

280
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,011
- Oh, look at this…
- Look!

281
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,619
That’s it!

282
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,779
One… and another…
Honesty pays well.

283
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,851
The thirst is huge…

284
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,697
The thirst is huge, my life’s dwindling
away, lemme daydream pleasantly,

285
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,817
…listen to the nightingales, sing along
and drink.

286
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,169
Merci.

287
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,819
Oh, too salty.

288
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,055
- It’s your first time here, isn’t it?
- We met before?

289
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:50,688
I knew you even as a kid.
You’re my star. Believe me?

290
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,417
- Me not that old.
- So you don’t believe?

291
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,653
Let me show you something.

292
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,338
Come on, it’s not far.

293
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,656
You speak french?

294
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,733
Is this me?

295
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,653
This is not me.

296
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,375
No way, it’s not me.

297
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,738
- It surely is you.
- It isn’t. - Really. - No.

298
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,211
Just take a good look.

299
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,900
- It’s not me.
- A good look!

300
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,736
Like that?

301
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,615
Like that…?

302
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,375
Not me at all.

303
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,292
What do you think?

304
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,974
Like this she similar.
A bit.

305
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,898
I'll show you…
because sitting like this…

306
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,293
Not completely me. Is it?

307
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,734
To catch it it mustn’t show interest.

308
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,016
The pray will then let itself be seized.

309
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,969
It mustn’t show interest.

310
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,290
That’s it.

311
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,974
The pray will let itself
to be seized by it.

312
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,934
I must give this a try soon.

313
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,978
There’s something for you.
Some free dates at the big hall.

314
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,859
Put it here.

315
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,332
Are you angry?

316
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,410
No.

317
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,895
Because of yesterday?

318
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,499
Because I didn’t dance with you?

319
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,939
What are you writing?

320
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,130
Nothing for you.

321
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,257
Come on…

322
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,412
- So František is angry…
- Leave me alone.

323
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,819
Well, after you change your mind,

324
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,411
you can invite me tonight.

325
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,170
I’m afraid I can’t.

326
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,650
Where’s the will, there’s a way.

327
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,378
Hot, isn’t it?

328
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,820
Enough! I’m going home.

329
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,379
I’m going home!

330
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,733
You won’t find me here.

331
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,490
- Comrade director, how do you do.
- Where…

332
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,252
- Where are you heading?
- Nowhere.

333
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,019
- I mean, for some posters.
- Well go ahead.

334
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,373
When you’re back come to see me.

335
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,015
- Know why I’m here?
- About those damaged chairs?

336
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,648
That also, but mostly about the
performance of those…

337
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,814
dirty musicians and singers.

338
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,338
People, wake up.
You know the situation.

339
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,210
There was even a consultation
in the cultural department.

340
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,333
And it’s all your business.

341
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,129
- You are responsible.
- Those boys got a rating.

342
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,530
Leave me alone with your rating.

343
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,732
It’s a club for youngsters
in the first place.

344
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,130
Their opinions are still forming.

345
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,931
We can’t play them such dirty music.

346
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,259
Can you see what it could cause?

347
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:50,492
Be happy that it’s been settled
this way without more sanctions.

348
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,974
- Hell, what way?
- Keep calm, sit down.

349
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,571
It’ll only be canceled, nothing more.

350
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,770
The place’ll be used as a
campaign center. That’s it.

351
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,020
Perhaps you’ll be allowed to play
there now and then.

352
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,934
What’s this here? Show me?

353
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,571
- It’s only… - Only What?
- A performance we're working on. - Wait

354
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,693
Another and another people get in.

355
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,495
Here you go, it’s nice.
Fine start.

356
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,777
Another and another people get off.

357
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,899
Get off? God, off what?

358
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,014
- Anywhere.
- Wait.

359
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,695
Don’t get off after the sound signal.

360
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,297
Oh, from the subway, you should
Have said. It’s not wrong then.

361
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,293
Don’t get off.
It’s clear as a day.

362
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,658
Don’t get off and hurry to leave
the door way.

363
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,889
He can’t see the rear-view mirror,
didn’t make it.

364
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,099
He collapsed from the drive of our time.

365
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,217
Wait a minute.
Collapsed from the drive of our time.

366
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,575
What does it mean?

367
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,811
- Well. - What?
- Nothing, I don’t know…

368
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,378
- Couldn’t take it anymore.
- Now, who couldn’t?

369
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,968
Who do you mean, comrade?

370
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,050
Nobody, dunno.

371
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,300
Dunno! "Dunno" but still he writes.

372
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:29,536
He writes not knowing that everything
needs a clear ideological basis.

373
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,779
What’s wrong with your brains, sonny?

374
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,291
We also used to do theater plays,
and what kind!

375
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,777
We chose nice plays to 
make people laugh.

376
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,495
And not to make them collapse
from the drive of time.

377
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,738
Here, it has to disappear…

378
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,219
- Now, like this.
- We meant something else.

379
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,171
Else! Everyone must think something else

380
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,816
Everyone must think the same way…
something else.

381
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:09,330
And not this… “These days don’t
differ more than eggs”.

382
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,134
What? The thought must be clear
and understandable for everyone.

383
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,580
The thought must be clear and
understandable for everyone.

384
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,695
Don’t laugh, gentlemen.
I stand for revolution.

385
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,575
But no one volunteers to execute it.

386
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,177
That’s the main dilemma of scientific
revolution.

387
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,698
- 3, 2, 1!
- 3, 2, 1!

388
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,773
Another and another carnival float
appears.

389
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,893
- Everybody asks…
- What will you be like, vodka?

390
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,815
What will you be like, polar bear?

391
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,013
Wait, gentlemen.
Know this one?

392
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,333
There.
General paralysis proceeds.

393
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,735
Don’t drink, when you can’t
handle it.

394
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,814
Chocolate Betty and her ensemble
enter.

395
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,094
- Here. - Want one of them,
František?

396
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,579
Me?

397
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,534
Are you sure?

398
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,092
Don't worry, it’s gonna be OK.

399
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,931
- Have some cash? - Why?
- For the bog.

400
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,256
Hurry up.

401
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,657
- Geez, you’re so slow. Gimme.
- Wait. - It’s OK.

402
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,859
- If someone leaves, let me know?
- What?

403
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,218
- Let me know, if someone leaves.
- I’ll take care.

404
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,129
- Františkek! - Here he is.
- You are here?

405
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,815
Why weren’t you at the
banquet last night?

406
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,099
I guess it’s too square for me…

407
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,890
You made a mistake.

408
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,052
You may have made contacts with
very important people…

409
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,692
Don’t underestimate it. Though I admit
this place is much less boring.

410
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,211
Oh, even Brazilians are let in?

411
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,453
This is just terrible.

412
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:13,739
I say, it’s quite amusing to
watch folk amuse themselves.

413
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,129
- Come on, will you? Hurry up.
- Who do you speak with?

414
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,657
- With you indeed, asshole.
- I beg your pardon.

415
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,454
It’s preferable not to respond
to such trash, Mr. director.

416
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,850
- WTF?
- Will you lemme go, damn it?!

417
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,849
Nelly, come here.
“Digima lezina veroni.”

418
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,056
Gypsy baron, it’s me,

419
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,337
every gypsy girl knows me…

420
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,494
Where’s Janinka?
I’m madly in love.

421
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,048
Everybody come here,
let’s go for coffee.

422
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,893
- As you please, Mr. baron.
- I’m in love.

423
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,496
- This thing’s surely gonna
fall apart. - Janička!

424
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,333
Hit the road.

425
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,737
And now, gentlemen?
Let’s go to ours.

426
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,898
- I’m gonna get some sleep.
- I’m gonna get some life.

427
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,815
I’m going to the office.
Have to take some posters there.

428
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,531
I have to go there too.
Need to take something there.

429
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,130
Yep, take something there,
how kind of you.

430
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,772
- Kind of him, isn’t it?
- Don’t forget, boldly and rough.

431
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,056
For the lady in 360.
A bottle of mineral water on ice.

432
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,458
- Get on the table.
- How? Where?

433
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,778
- It’s dangerous.
- Get on me.

434
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,058
- Not that way, the other way.
- Like this?

435
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,059
I’m afraid.

436
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,612
I’m afraid!

437
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:47,492
Bob Saint-Clar was eluding Karpov’s
hands with natty, feline steps…

438
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,496
and then he undressed her,
boldly and rough…

439
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,813
Hey, slinger!

440
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,851
Excuse me, I would need…

441
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,774
- I’m not sure…
- Take it off, come on.

442
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,815
Here’s my coat.

443
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,731
I knew it was you.

444
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,129
Yesterday.

445
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,139
Bravo.

446
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,891
Go on.

447
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,293
Well…

448
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,212
Go on.

449
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,450
Go on, sporty!

450
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,371
Come on now!

451
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,695
Piss off, bastard!

452
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,574
Hey, where are you?

453
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,379
Damned…

454
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,139
Where is it, man? The coat!

455
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,417
I’ll kill you!

456
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,049
Let’s raise our song,

457
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,894
our flag will wave forever.

458
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,531
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

459
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,175
My love, it’s a bead of dew
at the bottom of bloom.

460
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,890
My love, it’s a
wedding gift from forest elves.

461
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,979
- My love…
- What’s happened to you, moron?

462
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,899
Where you easily brake your neck,
there I took off my hat.

463
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,975
God, where are your glasses?
Those beautiful sun glasses?

464
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,456
Really.
Aren’t they important as hell?

465
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,452
Can’t you see,
the reflection of infra-red shine…

466
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,815
on coherent layer of snow…

467
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,937
is as dangerous for eyeballs as…

468
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:07,369
…a window opened in January for
a patient struck with bronchitis?!

469
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,210
So shut it, you moron.

470
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,578
- How many horses does it have?
- Divide its hooves by four.

471
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,492
A hoof here, a hoof there…

472
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,094
The second day passed for the
ninth time.

473
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,012
- Hoof there…
…hoof here

474
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,174
The mirror reflections burn in the sun.

475
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,739
My heart caws out from 
the body's frame…

476
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,416
…And the evening rises…
…My forehead in the line…

477
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,656
…And the command: castle…
…My command: direction-

478
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,219
Forgot the ninth thing in the second day
-Through bush he hears a strong sound

479
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,537
The hooves beat unreason.

480
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,500
A hoof here, a hoof there.

481
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,853
- The cymbals ring…
…in the grotesque of the night…

482
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,619
Only kettledrums yell about my death!

483
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,095
- Here we go, assholes.
- Get off, final station!

484
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,774
Look, our salami’s been eaten.

485
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,255
We’ll never get this outta there.

486
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,218
Look!
Czechoslovakian television.

487
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,175
Over there, artiodactyls!

488
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,451
Hoof here,

489
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,693
Hoof there, jerks.

490
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,894
Struggling through the path
around Cotter Creek…

491
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,775
here comes Florián Targonelli.

492
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,776
The cap reinforces the mind
jumping at little joys.

493
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,611
The hooves beat unreason.

494
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,090
Gee-up, boys!

495
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,571
Nice horses.

496
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,778
Nice yes, but never stand behind them.

497
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,135
No worry, animals love me.

498
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,850
Geez, what kind of swines do you have?

499
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,339
Your joy - a little fairy of unease.

500
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,733
And I fall dazzled by its blackness.

501
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,257
Well, dear audience,

502
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,935
a hoof here, a hoof there…

503
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,692
doesn’t pay well.

504
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,814
Peaks and valleys, black forest…

505
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,977
Peaks and valleys, black forest…

506
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,180
I haven’t seen my dolly yet today.

507
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,135
I haven’t seen my…

508
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,530
There’s a dolly!

509
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,175
Come on, move!
You can do it.

510
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,572
Come on now! Come on!

511
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,817
Come on, only a little longer!

512
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,455
- Move!
- Hop, hop, hop...

513
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,134
- I book the Fisher-skis-chicks.
- I book Rosignole-ones.

514
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,849
- I book Bohemia-ones.
- Dědek, there go Bohemias.

515
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,408
Move, come on!

516
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,651
Come on, 5 seconds left…
I guess.

517
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,096
Move!

518
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,735
We can’t go on like this, boys.
Let’s get into action.

519
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,093
That is action Z -
- the rearrangement of the fence.

520
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,813
Move on.

521
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,693
Oh, I see…

522
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,929
Look, there she’s coming.

523
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:42,048
Here comes the first one,
a Fisher-snow-lady.

524
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,052
Move on!

525
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,697
Come on, hurry up!

526
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,979
Hey, my darling is coming.

527
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,098
Harry up, Dědek.

528
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,651
Before the next one arrives.

529
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,773
Come on.
We must arrange it now.

530
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,818
- Watch out!
- It’s nothing serious, young lady.

531
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,772
Everything’s gonna be all right.

532
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,814
- Man, have you gone mad?
- Nothing’s gonna be all right!

533
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,376
Everything’s spoiled, ruined!

534
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,418
- It’s too late for everything.
- It only seems like it.

535
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,294
The sun will rise again.

536
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,537
Have a little look at me.
Come on, give us a smile.

537
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,096
There, it becomes you.

538
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,255
Here comes fernet.

539
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,572
Shall we dance?

540
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:22,777
Order something for me,
I’ll try it with Petra.

541
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:45,214
May I have a dance?

542
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,651
- Stop it! - What are you doing?
His meal is getting cold!

543
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:42,250
You castrated cuckolds!
You braindead mug!

544
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,975
Fecal asshole!

545
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,737
Mountain bastards!

546
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,852
What’s up…?

547
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,570
Pepe, open up!

548
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,497
Pepe, be reasonable!

549
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,050
They’re only pretending.
It’s all arranged.

550
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,377
Pepe, please!

551
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,379
Let me be! I’m an invalid!

552
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,373
- Lemme be!
- Act better, dilettantes.

553
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,172
You cuckolds!

554
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,892
It’ll end in no time. Let’s hide
meanwhile. Cover your ears.

555
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,809
Stop it, moron!

556
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,011
Lemme be, assholes!

557
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,732
- I can’t take it… - Take what?
It’s nothing but an act.

558
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,897
- I have to open it.
- Come to bed. - No.

559
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,774
- Look, such poor acting.
- I’ll open it.

560
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,573
Why should you?

561
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,368
Stay here.

562
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,929
Damn it!

563
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:05,211
- Oh, he’s bleeding! - Tasteless.
Where’s Dědek with the ketchup?

564
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,014
- Doesn’t he look like you.
- Which one?

565
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,689
- Why, the red one.
- Looks rather like you.

566
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,615
- Hardly—
- Man, What a mug.

567
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,699
- But he really looks like you.
- You think so?

568
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,815
- Sure, your brother in America.
- Funny guy, aren't you?

569
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,219
- Petruška, we do also amateur theater.
- You said “we”?

570
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,169
- Especially Franta, I mean.
- That’s better.

571
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,375
And when’s your opening?

572
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:04,893
I’m not sure yet
when he finishes it up.

573
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,655
You make it up yourselves?

574
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,812
Ourselves, really.

575
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:18,815
And then František writes it down
in his office, doesn’t he?

576
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,413
Naturally by peacock plume.

577
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,011
Ouch, you asshole.

578
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,614
It’s the theatre d’auteur, see?

579
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,368
Kind of hyperbole,

580
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,539
Kind of parabole…

581
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,973
Something utterly new.

582
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,170
Something unreal,
something unrepeatable,

583
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,495
overstatement, gag, satire…

584
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,092
Kind of… experimental.

585
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,488
Something utterly new.

586
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,210
Oh, the freedom.

587
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,893
The liberty.

588
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,096
The relief.

589
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,659
An utterly new theater.

590
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,852
Jesus, I hear something.
Wait!

591
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,690
- My dad… Jesus Christ! - Dad, really?
- Come on, get dressed.

592
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,178
Hide, we can’t be found here
like this.

593
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,852
- You’re still up? - Hi.
- Guess what I’ve brought for you.

594
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,213
Some wax, see?
For your skiing.

595
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,978
Something wrong?

596
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,376
- How do you do.
- What are you doing here?

597
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,570
- A pal’s here for watching the VCR.
- VCR my ass!

598
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:56,416
And she’ll get a cottage
from her father…

599
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,173
This could be sold for some 150 or 200 
thousand, even with a hen house.

600
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,377
- You’re an asshole.
- She’s not silly enough to come.

601
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,255
And what about Jiřina?

602
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,739
Whatever. He’ll put her with
this cat in the same bed.

603
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,850
Let’s wait only 10 more minutes…
then off we go.

604
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,299
You’ll be sorry one day,

605
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,497
- when you know life.
- Shut up!

606
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,534
- Damn…
- Try the doorbell, chicken.

607
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,695
I won’t get the serial here.

608
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,696
At worst, you’ll be
attacked by a piece of wax.

609
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,170
Piss off from the bell, man!

610
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,218
I won’t be told what to do!

611
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,053
I’ll do what I want!

612
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,090
Well, some paprika would come in handy.

613
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,048
What’s the red stuff in there?

614
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,094
No kidding, man.
Is he throwing up blood or what.

615
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,618
Is he perhaps yellow?

616
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,975
Stop it, you…!

617
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,610
Go for the X-ray
first thing tomorrow.

618
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,372
Of course.

619
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,929
Don’t eat, drink or smoke…
And as doctor said:

620
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,578
Don’t forgot the diet.

621
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,457
And don’t cheer up after 
first sign of relief.

622
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:30,496
Don't worry, I’m so sick that I’ll
obey everything. Goodbye.

623
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,131
- Oh, hi.
- ciao.

624
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,658
You’re back already?

625
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,610
What a mess in here.

626
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:38,010
- I was looking forward so much.
- You don’t say.

627
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,699
- You weren’t?
- I was but I’m sick.

628
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:46,013
You don’t care about me at all.

629
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,609
Not even telling me where you were.

630
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:57,209
You’re still god knows where.
Saying nothing to me.

631
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,691
- How was it? Was there some snow?
- Yep, lots of snow.

632
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,459
Could you make for me
an herbal tea? It’s in that bag.

633
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,015
So you’re sick?

634
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,333
Our Pepíček doesn’t feel well?

635
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,933
So, to the bed… now!

636
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:24,492
Let’s do a little massage.

637
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:32,299
- Lemme be, please, I’m sick.
- Smiling is a cure, give us a smile.

638
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,698
I’ll get isotopes…
And now you’re like this.

639
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:32,019
Who do you think?

640
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,779
- He gave me this address.
- What…?

641
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,298
Well.

642
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,692
So, here it is.

643
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,770
- There’s no-one there.
- You know where they are?

644
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,810
They went to the storeroom
for some flags.

645
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,697
Or maybe to the hall.

646
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,413
Mr. manager, are you there?

647
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,614
Geez, someone’s in the corridor.

648
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,251
Is there an electrical fuse?

649
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:47,379
- Don’t go.
- I have to.

650
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,458
We need a fuse, comrades are there
in the dark.

651
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,810
The doorkeeper has spare keys.
He could come here.

652
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,656
Wait. I’ll get dressed.

653
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:11,611
- Let’s go… wait.
- Mr. manager, hurry up, will you?

654
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,092
- Wait here.
- Like this?

655
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,297
Hide yourself, I’ll lock it.

656
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,175
- To where?
- To there.

657
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:25,219
What’s up? Coming…
I’ll be back later.

658
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,769
Come on.

659
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,855
I must be dreaming.

660
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,134
Dreaming, Mr. manager?

661
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,856
You weren’t sleeping, were you?

662
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:44,492
No, comrade manager.
I was cleaning up in here.

663
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:48,371
It’s a great mess in here though.

664
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:53,658
But you've found the flag we need,
haven’t you?

665
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:58,258
- There in the back.
- Oh, I can see it.

666
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:02,649
Shall I get it out,
comrade manager?

667
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:07,496
I’m not so old I can't
do it myself, am I?

668
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,812
Here it is!

669
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,613
Man, that’s funny.

670
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:30,337
Dear comrades,
we must realize,

671
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,040
Where we stand and…

672
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,258
What our goals are.

673
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:42,576
See the motto for today:

674
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:47,492
We must protect the peace
at any cost.

675
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,575
No worry, one of them may have
left since then.

676
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,569
Don’t leave me, please.

677
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,088
- Sometimes she's so mean.
- Don't worry.

678
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,174
Easy.

679
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,898
Watch out.

680
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,940
Jiřinka, We have come.

681
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,291
I brought a pal with me.

682
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:16,328
Don’t be angry with me, please.

683
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,052
If I had known…

684
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,459
We need to take a rest in the
living room, come on.

685
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,453
With this cat in the same bed…

686
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,292
- Where are you going?
- Let go!

687
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:26,135
- You're going nowhere.
- Let me be!

688
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,850
Nowhere, I say!

689
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,448
You have to explain this.

690
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,135
I’m not gonna explain a thing.

691
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:40,294
- What do you mean, not a thing?
- As simple as that.

692
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:46,450
- Now, what do you think?
- I won’t talk about this.

693
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:50,170
- Huh, you won’t talk about this…
- I won’t.

694
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,539
Gimme the keys!

695
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,216
How dare you?
It’s the keys to my motorbike.

696
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:01,095
- You have no right.
Let it go. - The keys…

697
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:08,496
This means, either her or me.

698
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,251
Do as you please,

699
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,889
you hysteric.

700
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:20,729
So you call me hysteric?
You… call me… hysteric?!!

701
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:29,372
This means…
I go… OK.

702
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,496
- I'll take this.
- Just take it.

703
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,930
- I'll take this too.
- Oh, not me!

704
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,379
Not me!

705
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,170
Stop trotting around, dammit.

706
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,494
No one needs the scene you’re making.

707
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,936
- No one needs the scenes I’m making!
- That’s right.

708
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:15,172
You should calm down finally.
It’s not funny anymore.

709
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,970
- Here, you got it.
- You bitch.

710
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,172
Man, I can’t believe it.

711
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,696
Go to her, please.

712
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,850
Jiřina, wait!
Take it easy!

713
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,651
- Don’t touch me!
- Why are you like this to me?

714
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,449
- I’m not guilty of that.
- Not guilty?

715
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:56,898
- See, you could hurt yourself.
- You're all guilty, I hate you.

716
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,772
You saw that, he hit me.

717
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,215
And in front of that bimbo.

718
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:08,210
I’ll kill him.
I’ll do something to myself…!

719
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,292
Do something, a good idea.

720
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,089
Coffee for instance.

721
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,573
Coffee is ready.

722
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,774
Jesus, Hanka.

723
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,615
Jesus, what’s the time?

724
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,728
Jesus, Jiřina…

725
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,535
Jesus, Hanka…

726
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,858
Jesus, wait! Jesus Christ!

727
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:58,131
Jesus Christ, just don’t go apeshit.

728
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,129
- Hanka, please, don’t be angry.
- I’m not angry at all.

729
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,293
I’ll explain everything.

730
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,695
Don’t explain anything,
please, Mr. Doctor.

731
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:18,056
Don’t call me Mr. Doctor, geez.
Calm down, please.

732
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,017
Let me be, please.
Got work to do.

733
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:23,493
Easy, you’ll make everything fall here.

734
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:33,252
I guess, you’re a bit better
at playing chess.

735
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,971
What do you want?

736
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,737
- I’d like to have more games with you.
- Oh, please!

737
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,695
I mean chess.

738
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,096
Oh, chess.

739
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:53,575
So you want to play sports.

740
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,776
Play sports then.

741
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:00,217
But you’re not gonna play with me,

742
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,458
you fatso!

743
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,173
Viruses whirl in the swirl of life.

744
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,969
They whirl in the swirl of blood.

745
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,728
We, the outcasts of outcasts,
believe in death.

746
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:22,138
Oh no!

747
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,215
I, a strong lymphocyte,
led by the radar of the heart,

748
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,056
came from the empire of
stop-angina and aspirin

749
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,979
to exterminate that insect
with chromium wings,

750
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,257
to put an end to bacillus.

751
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,370
If bacillus are there, they won’t be.

752
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:47,976
But we, viruses, changed by swirling
into hybrids carved into the heart.

753
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,210
So a gun will help.

754
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:01,696
I bring victory, firing
with both hands.

755
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:13,216
- He really wrote it himself?
- So what?

756
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,811
I had no idea he was so…

757
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,412
…what?
You don’t mean potent, do you?

758
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,972
- How was it?
- Good, wasn’t it?

759
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,016
Now dear friends, let me invite you
to a lavish dinner.

760
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,696
Well, great.

761
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,051
If not for bacillus, we couldn’t
even scoff properly.

762
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:39,291
- Petra, I feel sick. - Come on.
- Don’t resist, come on.

763
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:43,134
- Fernet is healing, whatever
you're feeling. - Shut up and go.

764
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,531
- Hurry up.
- Wait up!

765
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,972
What will our pretty guy have?

766
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,929
Fernet with vodka, a big one.
Get it ready.

767
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,892
Alps down, now knock!

768
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,377
Bring it to the table.

769
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:04,539
- Fernet.
- No, I won’t drink.

770
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,132
Why? He can’t drink.
He’s not well.

771
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,610
It’d make him sick, huh?

772
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,574
- I don’t feel like it!
- Ouch.

773
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,415
- Cheers then.
- Cheers.

774
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,729
I’m not sure.

775
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,092
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Here you are.

776
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,539
What is it "Chateaubriand"?

777
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,499
Do you know, František?

778
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,576
Chateaubriand.

779
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,130
That’s the stuff which,
put among your dresses,

780
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,014
when you then wear the dresses,

781
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:51,573
will also make you smell
like Chateaubriand.

782
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:55,530
Right, for anorexia 
a diet is the best.

783
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,537
I mean vice versa,
for a diet is anorexia the best.

784
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,970
Mr. waiter
I’ll have storks with poppyseed.

785
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:06,857
- I beg your pardon…
- I mean the pepper stake, OK?

786
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,733
Thank you, how kind of you.

787
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,491
Aren’t they funny chaps?

788
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,374
I do envy your theater.

789
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,890
If you like,
you could try it too.

790
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:24,696
I think, you would be a boon.

791
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:37,255
You really think that I could?

792
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:42,411
You want a theater, huh?
Then watch this play.

793
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,255
What a nice flame.

794
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,812
Petruška,

795
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,978
here’s to our friendship.

796
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,251
Let’s have a little play.
Why not?

797
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,171
Has he gone mad?

798
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:04,850
- Let’s flame.
- Stop it!

799
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,010
I’m not a piece of meat!

800
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,497
Is the skinny guy perhaps drunk?

801
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,697
Let’s all do a play.
What do you think?

802
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,653
We'll all set the world on fire!

803
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,812
The first actors enter,
so come on,

804
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,257
If you feel like a play,
it’s gonna be cool!

805
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:33,013
Juvenile first! Right?
Now what?!

806
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:37,332
Beware, a fire! But he who wants to
set one must burn himself.

807
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,618
Don’t we like one another!

808
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:46,653
I don’t want to see alcohol any more,
a shame to society.

809
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:50,449
- What’s up? - I came to meet my
buddy you caught last night.

810
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:53,498
You think you can come whenever
you like to?

811
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:57,812
- What’s his name? - Josef Málek.
- Málek. Wait a minute.

812
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,255
- Thank you.
- Pick up the cap!

813
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,697
- Hit me and you’ll have to pick me up!
- In the name of law, pick it up!

814
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,891
- No point, let it be.
- All right.

815
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:12,452
As I see again and again,
alcohol is frigging mean.

816
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:15,930
Calm him down.
That Málek’s been brought away.

817
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,251
To the infection department,
so don’t bother here and go home.

818
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:25,612
If you don’t want to be dragged down,
don't drink another one.

819
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,535
But it’s getting better,
isn’t it?

820
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:41,615
Your liver is still enlarged,

821
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:47,492
but it seems to have stabilized.
You need to help it.

822
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,013
How can I?

823
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:52,497
You need a bigger will for health.
Parties aren’t good.

824
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:55,413
- I was ill with it too.
- Glad to hear it.

825
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,091
What do you mean?

826
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,929
You seem to have recovered.

827
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:04,617
It’s our early days in theater.
About 13 years old then.

828
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,808
And Pepe, when did he go in with you?

829
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,734
When we began to study, I guess.

830
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:18,651
- It’s Pepe. - There’s a poem
František composed to this.

831
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:23,977
Two jerks walk through the morning dew
and desire lays about them.

832
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:27,537
Why did you study veterinary
when you like theater?

833
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,779
- Well I was fond of animals.
Look… - You made this?

834
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:36,731
- No, my dad brought it to me.
And here’s a tiny one. - A tiger!

835
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:39,937
- Or rather cow…
- Why, it’s a bull.

836
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,769
You’re a bull.
This is an ox.

837
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,897
Then what is this?
Tell me.

838
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:51,691
Say again…
Why did you study veterinary?

839
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,938
Well, you know…
I said it before.

840
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:58,854
I was fond of animals, My dad
always brought me to the country.

841
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:05,012
But then, when you see it right
in front of you… in praxis, see?

842
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,893
It’s terrible.

843
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:10,340
And you have to act
like it’s all normal.

844
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:17,260
Playing theater you pretend too
but it’s fun at least, see?

845
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,214
Look, the TV for instance.

846
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,096
It amuses the whole nation.

847
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,690
Only, we mustn’t let people fight
one another.

848
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:32,652
You know, to read the report isn’t the
same as to see it with one’s own eyes.

849
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,772
What about my folks?
Do you get on well with them now?

850
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,455
There were some arguments…

851
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,496
But it’s all right now.

852
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:46,336
At the start it was hard for
both the factory and us.

853
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,173
Rather not talk about it.
But you helped us a lot.

854
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:53,010
Now we only need to
produce those 161 bottles.

855
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,016
I, a lymphocyte…

856
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:05,414
…strong…
…strong…

857
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,533
Again, do it form the start.

858
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:16,332
I, a strong lymphocyte, came…

859
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,136
…led by the radar of the heart. Again!

860
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,968
The heart.
You know what it is, don’t you?

861
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:32,174
- I, a strong lymphocyte, come form…
- What kind of coming is this?

862
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,129
How does a lymphocyte walk?

863
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,219
- Dunno.
- With a sword!

864
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,734
But I don’t have one.

865
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:46,650
- Imagine that. Act like you do.
- With sword…

866
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,449
- A strong lymphocyte…
- From the start? - No, go on.

867
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,409
I, a strong lymphocyte, come

868
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,853
form the empire… lead by…

869
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:11,015
- Lead by the radar of heart.
- By the radar. - From the start.

870
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:16,980
I, a strong lymphocyte,
come from the empire of lymphocytes…

871
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,134
Now, what lymphocytes?
Of Stop-Angina, isn’t it?

872
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:25,691
- Stop-Angina. - Yep.
- What’s that? Don’t get it.

873
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:29,252
What do you mean?
Take off the helmet and come here.

874
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:33,013
Imagine this is a bed

875
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:37,499
and now you must lay into the
role, see?

876
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,529
You must live the role.

877
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:42,771
Theater, it’s a hard job.

878
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,936
You have to keep pushing.

879
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:50,417
- Now what? Do you want to act?
- I do.

880
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:53,692
You have to lay further back,
we can’t rehearse like this.

881
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,129
Imagine summer, a beach…

882
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:05,495
It's hot there, you have to take off…

883
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,619
Losing your mind?!

884
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,256
No, losing my weight.

885
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:17,337
Pepe’s prowling the place,

886
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,649
Pursuing Petra.

887
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,929
Petra, please go…

888
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,495
There’s nobody here…

889
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:58,453
- Hi.
- Hello, notary.

890
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,651
- What’s this party?
- An engagement.

891
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:06,370
- Jana’s going to marry the director.
- Where’s Petra?

892
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,017
At work. Where else?

893
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,932
Are you jealous?

894
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:24,013
You're having a party too, boys?

895
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,292
What’s wrong with you?

896
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:31,492
Don’t get mean because of me.

897
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,018
What’s up?

898
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,928
First, I wanted to assign you
as the father…

899
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:42,374
But I didn’t because it occurred to me…

900
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,134
Hey, where are you going?

901
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:49,695
- Where’s he going? - So you
even had something with Pepe?

902
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,610
Oh, only once at that dance.

903
01:24:55,700 --> 01:25:00,171
- What dance?
- The one all three of you were at.

904
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,055
Huh, so even with Dědek.

905
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,575
What’s the big deal?

906
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:10,130
Everyone should have fun
before they grow old.

907
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,857
Well, what do you think, boys?

908
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:17,056
Congratulations.

909
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,216
It came all of a sudden.

910
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:25,772
By the way congratulations to him
as well, he’s a candidate.

911
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,538
Me?

912
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:34,088
Oh, your memory…
It’s getting worse.

913
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:38,372
Sometimes it’s better that way.
Isn’t it, Janinka?

914
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:44,016
And you must drop by someday.
We are like a family now.

915
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,452
Geez, I shrunk.

916
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:52,818
Do you know how
a fission chain reaction occurs?

917
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,459
Theoretically like this:

918
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:59,898
Imagine: When this neutron meets
the nucleus of uranium 235,

919
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:04,299
Something incredible happens.
Watch.

920
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:11,179
The nucleus, placid until now, vibrates

921
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:15,538
And immediately divides itself
into two parts of the same weight…

922
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,890
And two or three free neutrons.

923
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,733
Why did I come to you anyway?

924
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:25,293
Can you explain?

925
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,099
I am what I am.

926
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:32,968
We have just witnessed a 
nuclear reaction.

927
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,451
- The free neutrons made by the fissure
- But why are you doing this?

928
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,731
Why are you ruining yourself?

929
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:42,137
You’ve been ill, you have 
to take care now.

930
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,575
And why?

931
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,539
Will you tell me one reason
I should take care?

932
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:52,662
Me for instance.

933
01:26:53,617 --> 01:26:56,327
- Come on, you weren’t even awaiting me.

934
01:26:56,569 --> 01:26:59,556
- …amount of electricity
goes adrift… - What do you mean?

935
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:04,335
I’ve been waiting here the whole night,
I also need to do something.

936
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,658
Something that I like.

937
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,937
…first atomic bomb was
dropped on Hiroshima.

938
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:13,291
I guess, you like too many things!

939
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:16,653
I didn’t know you don't like anything

940
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:21,649
Could one do anything but
go mad in this jungle?

941
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,492
…enabled by this reaction.

942
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:26,970
I didn’t see you trying to
resist anything.

943
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,739
Resist what for god’s sake?
And with who?

944
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,740
It’s only riffraff all around.

945
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:37,372
It’s a hard one then.

946
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:41,248
- Petra… Petruška, please.

947
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,650
…to make the wheels of a steam turbine
spin we need coal.

948
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:48,972
- You are the only one left.
- Lemme go, please.

949
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,450
- …fission chain reaction.
- Better undress and wash off.

950
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,895
God knows what you’ve 
been walking through.

951
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:13,413
- Are you offended?
- No.

952
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,131
I’m kinda sick.

953
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,290
I gotta go.

954
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,298
Go then.

955
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,654
Go to work like a good girl.

956
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,496
And bring some beer!

957
01:28:39,388 --> 01:28:43,176
Sick. I feel so sick.

958
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:46,461
What have you stuffed into me?

959
01:29:10,788 --> 01:29:13,586
Are you Josef Málek?

960
01:29:13,668 --> 01:29:18,503
I'm here to inspect you. Show me
your sick note, please.

961
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:22,901
- Are you not in bed?
- Doesn’t it do that I’m home?!

962
01:29:23,588 --> 01:29:26,978
I hope you go for walks
as doctor recommended?

963
01:29:27,908 --> 01:29:31,025
Wait, look up.
Not like this!

964
01:29:32,388 --> 01:29:36,301
Jesus, Your whites are so yellow,
you need a hospital immediately.

965
01:29:36,468 --> 01:29:38,857
- Where’s your phone?
- I don’t have one.

966
01:29:39,148 --> 01:29:42,424
Here. I’m going to order an ambulance.

967
01:29:43,108 --> 01:29:45,668
But I just came from the hospital.

968
01:29:46,828 --> 01:29:48,261
Damn.

969
01:29:58,548 --> 01:30:01,585
I’m very  honored to have been elected…

970
01:30:01,668 --> 01:30:05,900
As a chairman of the SSM 
for our enterprise.

971
01:30:06,788 --> 01:30:11,259
Especially now, when such huge tasks
are imposed on us.

972
01:30:19,028 --> 01:30:23,067
I believe, in the period to come,
we will manage to improve…

973
01:30:23,308 --> 01:30:27,904
the whole course of our organization…

974
01:30:28,268 --> 01:30:33,023
and to strengthen its membership base.

975
01:30:33,988 --> 01:30:38,664
Of course I realize the burden
I will bear…

976
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:42,867
in our time of scientific revolution…

977
01:30:42,948 --> 01:30:45,587
but it can't be helped, dear friends.

978
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:47,505
We must work harder,

979
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:52,743
Harder, harder.
We all must unify!

980
01:31:07,188 --> 01:31:09,670
So what, are we playing on?

981
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,112
- Mate.

982
01:31:13,874 --> 01:31:15,874
Such a fool's mate, you greyhound!

983
01:31:17,542 --> 01:31:19,659
How about another game?
Old maid?

984
01:31:20,336 --> 01:31:22,859
Really!

985
01:31:22,948 --> 01:31:26,384
Well, that means
three losses for you.

986
01:31:26,508 --> 01:31:32,105
That's three ones.

987
01:31:33,228 --> 01:31:35,458
- Mommy, please.
- How do you do.

988
01:31:35,828 --> 01:31:38,342
Why are you bringing this?
Am I not on a diet?

989
01:31:38,468 --> 01:31:40,777
But don’t you have a visitor?

990
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:42,426
There’s a letter for you.

991
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,022
Here, young lady.

992
01:31:44,828 --> 01:31:47,945
She’s so thin and you offer
nothing to her.

993
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:53,705
There’s no place to put it down.
Oh, thanks.

994
01:31:53,788 --> 01:31:56,348
- Some coffee?
- No, mum.

995
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:57,827
- Bring nothing, please.
- I’d like to…

996
01:31:57,908 --> 01:32:00,263
- You’re kind. Thanks.
- Did I say—-

997
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:03,784
- Beware, young lady. He’s a
bit of a scoundrel. - Thanks.

998
01:32:04,668 --> 01:32:06,465
What is it?

999
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:09,297
Smells like hospital.
Must be from Pepe.

1000
01:32:09,948 --> 01:32:11,825
Is it that bad Mr. doctor?

1001
01:32:11,908 --> 01:32:14,058
We think it’s jaundice.

1002
01:32:14,588 --> 01:32:17,739
- How come they didn’t know sooner?
- We’re not sure even now,

1003
01:32:17,828 --> 01:32:20,979
but we are waiting for the test results.

1004
01:32:26,388 --> 01:32:30,097
- I’ll be stuck here for ages, huh?
- Well, for some time.

1005
01:32:31,628 --> 01:32:34,267
His tongue hangs out,
he can hardly breath.

1006
01:32:35,148 --> 01:32:40,586
Even the dark ground had mercy.
It moans: he’s thirsty, he rambles.

1007
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:43,580
Imbue him fast.
Or he dies and so do you.

1008
01:32:44,268 --> 01:32:47,943
The hidden breast of mine
springs now towards the thirsty.

1009
01:32:49,468 --> 01:32:51,698
Now, I have an inspiration.

1010
01:32:52,548 --> 01:32:55,699
I feel like a drink.
My chest is burning,

1011
01:32:55,868 --> 01:32:59,099
The churches are falling into ruins
above me. I feel like a drink.

1012
01:32:59,668 --> 01:33:01,499
A good one, I will use it.

1013
01:33:02,548 --> 01:33:06,746
A hole in the brain like…
like what?

1014
01:33:08,108 --> 01:33:10,906
Like the whole of…

1015
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:13,267
Africa!

1016
01:33:14,268 --> 01:33:16,862
Silly!… Well, actually…

1017
01:33:17,548 --> 01:33:20,426
Not so silly.

1018
01:33:26,828 --> 01:33:30,184
- Hello? - František?
- Yes, speaking. What’s up?

1019
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:31,587
Are you free?

1020
01:33:31,908 --> 01:33:36,299
- No, just working on a anti-alcohol
motto. - Of course.

1021
01:33:38,268 --> 01:33:42,102
A Career. Some of us must do it.

1022
01:33:50,508 --> 01:33:51,907
Hallo.

1023
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,340
What brings you here?

1024
01:33:55,068 --> 01:33:56,421
I came.

1025
01:33:57,628 --> 01:34:00,665
All those celebrations around
and you’re alone here.

1026
01:34:01,628 --> 01:34:03,539
So I dropped by.

1027
01:34:04,548 --> 01:34:06,379
Hope you can eat this.

1028
01:34:08,108 --> 01:34:10,463
Well, how are you?

1029
01:34:11,508 --> 01:34:13,624
You’re the last one I’d expected.

1030
01:34:15,628 --> 01:34:17,584
Aren't you glad?

1031
01:34:18,428 --> 01:34:20,100
Oh, I am…

1032
01:34:23,428 --> 01:34:27,216
Let’s spank our mean Pepíček!

1033
01:34:27,308 --> 01:34:30,937
Please, I don’t feel like this.
I’m sick.

1034
01:34:34,668 --> 01:34:37,865
And there’s also something for
Pepíček…

1035
01:34:39,268 --> 01:34:40,986
from Jiřinka.

1036
01:34:41,268 --> 01:34:43,736
This beats for you only.

1037
01:34:44,788 --> 01:34:46,267
I heard that before.

1038
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,816
You don’t believe me?

1039
01:34:50,308 --> 01:34:53,141
Look. What it says is true.

1040
01:34:54,108 --> 01:34:56,906
No one cares about you any more, huh?

1041
01:35:12,188 --> 01:35:16,147
Calm down now.
A changing station!

1042
01:35:16,908 --> 01:35:20,139
- What are you doing?
- Puff, it’s just a faker.

1043
01:35:20,828 --> 01:35:22,784
You’ll kill him!

1044
01:35:23,948 --> 01:35:29,306
The one who won’t obey and doesn't
take the prescribed cures properly,

1045
01:35:29,828 --> 01:35:32,547
I will operate… Nurse!

1046
01:35:33,348 --> 01:35:36,897
- What do you wish, master?
- My instruments!

1047
01:35:37,588 --> 01:35:39,226
Here.

1048
01:35:39,828 --> 01:35:41,864
Oh, udders!

1049
01:35:42,428 --> 01:35:46,307
These fallen angels are always
restraining.

1050
01:35:46,668 --> 01:35:50,343
Where’s the archangel with
the operating wagon?

1051
01:35:59,668 --> 01:36:04,458
Our comrade St. Nicholas…

1052
01:36:04,628 --> 01:36:07,506
He also collapsed from the drive
of our time.

1053
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:10,063
Damn, it’s falling.

1054
01:36:10,468 --> 01:36:13,460
What do my bright eyes see?

1055
01:36:14,868 --> 01:36:19,737
Our patient’s eyes are bloodshot.

1056
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:25,106
Close your eyes or you’ll bleed.

1057
01:36:25,468 --> 01:36:29,905
Wait, you demoniac furies.

1058
01:36:30,548 --> 01:36:32,664
March to the chimney!

1059
01:36:32,908 --> 01:36:35,820
Angel, a drip-feed, please.

1060
01:36:35,908 --> 01:36:40,140
I, as your doctor, prescribe you…

1061
01:36:40,348 --> 01:36:43,146
this marvelous medicine.

1062
01:36:43,428 --> 01:36:46,420
Stop it, he can’t drink this.
Give it to me.

1063
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:50,224
If he doesn’t volunteer to
go to heaven,

1064
01:36:50,948 --> 01:36:53,667
he’ll be forced to.

1065
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:56,862
- Well, well…
- No, no!

1066
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:58,980
Oh no!

1067
01:36:59,508 --> 01:37:02,625
Oh, he’s heartless, has no heart.

1068
01:37:02,988 --> 01:37:06,742
Now give him the kiss of life.

1069
01:37:06,828 --> 01:37:09,865
Call Dr. St Bernard from Cape Town…

1070
01:37:10,028 --> 01:37:12,178
to do the heart implantation.

1071
01:37:12,508 --> 01:37:15,341
And what is it down here?

1072
01:37:16,308 --> 01:37:20,586
Oh my, look at this.

1073
01:37:20,748 --> 01:37:23,706
Oh, udders!

1074
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:28,058
Do the catheterisation immediately!

1075
01:37:31,548 --> 01:37:33,220
- Don't worry!
- Quiet!

1076
01:37:33,508 --> 01:37:38,980
Let’s sign suspicious areas.
Lungs, appendix.

1077
01:37:39,108 --> 01:37:42,100
Appendix. Triodenum.

1078
01:37:42,228 --> 01:37:45,220
Leave the hairs alone!
What kind of angel are you?

1079
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:47,624
And nutrition!

1080
01:37:48,148 --> 01:37:49,376
Nutrition!

1081
01:37:52,068 --> 01:37:54,104
Don’t kick!

1082
01:37:54,228 --> 01:37:59,222
Take your nutrition. Come on,
give him mash.

1083
01:38:03,828 --> 01:38:05,307
Silence!

1084
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:09,661
Hey, this isn’t what I agreed to.
He’s seriously ill!

1085
01:38:10,348 --> 01:38:12,623
Somebody may come to scold us.

1086
01:38:12,868 --> 01:38:15,302
Oh yep, he’s seriously ill.

1087
01:38:15,588 --> 01:38:20,787
Then we must drink to our frail health.

1088
01:38:20,868 --> 01:38:23,462
Of course, champagne!

1089
01:38:25,868 --> 01:38:29,383
Oh, we forgot this.
AIDS diagnoses!

1090
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:35,303
Cheers!

1091
01:38:35,428 --> 01:38:37,578
Chairs.

1092
01:38:41,308 --> 01:38:43,697
Nurse, take blood from us all!

1093
01:38:44,428 --> 01:38:46,498
Jesus, really, I’m not sure…

1094
01:38:48,868 --> 01:38:51,507
He who signs on with the 
devil will know.

1095
01:38:51,628 --> 01:38:54,859
Strangle the hands of us all, angel,
like this.

1096
01:38:55,228 --> 01:38:58,379
And examine, learn, examine, learn.

1097
01:39:26,028 --> 01:39:27,746
So, have a good time.

1098
01:39:33,188 --> 01:39:35,338
She’s locked us in.

1099
01:39:37,148 --> 01:39:40,185
And she has my keys.
What will we do?

1100
01:39:40,348 --> 01:39:44,102
We’ll have to sleep
together here then.

1101
01:39:44,988 --> 01:39:46,660
Oh, really!

1102
01:39:46,828 --> 01:39:50,264
Sorry, we can watch
VCR for instance.

1103
01:39:51,548 --> 01:39:55,780
- Or we can go run-skiing.
- Oh my, what an idea!

1104
01:40:04,188 --> 01:40:07,783
- He doesn’t trust you?
- Why shouldn’t he?

1105
01:40:09,108 --> 01:40:11,383
He’s capable of anything.

1106
01:40:11,868 --> 01:40:16,020
I can’t imagine what I would do
in his shoes.

1107
01:40:17,948 --> 01:40:22,738
For I have never met anybody before
who cares about my feelings.

1108
01:40:23,628 --> 01:40:27,143
- But I’m boring you anyway.
- You’re not, go on.

1109
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:31,547
But whatever, everyone is always alone…

1110
01:40:32,428 --> 01:40:35,181
no matter if he’s round, square…

1111
01:40:36,148 --> 01:40:39,777
- or furnished with hooks like me.
- Don’t talk like this.

1112
01:40:43,828 --> 01:40:46,547
After all, I think…

1113
01:40:47,228 --> 01:40:51,141
the most lonely is the beauty,

1114
01:40:53,348 --> 01:40:55,464
because it’s so unique,

1115
01:40:56,788 --> 01:40:58,585
so striking,

1116
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:01,623
so fantastic,

1117
01:41:01,988 --> 01:41:04,661
that simply no one dares…

1118
01:41:17,508 --> 01:41:21,547
- How are you, Mr. Málek?
- Not great. - Give it to me, nurse.

1119
01:41:22,828 --> 01:41:24,625
Turn it off, please.

1120
01:41:25,468 --> 01:41:30,588
ALT decreased a little,
bilirubin is almost in the normal

1121
01:41:31,308 --> 01:41:33,026
Let’s have a look at it.

1122
01:41:34,948 --> 01:41:37,621
Wow, this is great!

1123
01:41:37,948 --> 01:41:40,462
This is so great!

1124
01:41:42,188 --> 01:41:43,780
This is really great!

1125
01:41:44,868 --> 01:41:50,067
- Now, I cut off my zipper.
- Oh, you have stripped pants!

1126
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:52,986
- Funny indeed.
- Do an elephant.

1127
01:41:53,228 --> 01:41:55,378
Huh, elephant…

1128
01:41:55,468 --> 01:41:58,346
- And lion, catch me…
- Just laugh at me, you-

1129
01:41:58,428 --> 01:42:00,464
Wait till I catch you,

1130
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:05,536
You’ve never seen an elephant
like the one I’ll do!

1131
01:42:05,868 --> 01:42:07,096
A donkey!

1132
01:42:10,668 --> 01:42:13,057
You have also stripped pants.

1133
01:42:13,948 --> 01:42:17,179
- Milánek… - Watch out, mother.
- Do you need something?

1134
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:21,666
No, I’m all right.

1135
01:42:23,468 --> 01:42:26,187
- Milánek…
- Watch out…

1136
01:42:26,588 --> 01:42:29,182
- Lemme go. - You are…
- Stop it.

1137
01:42:33,068 --> 01:42:34,626
Do a lion.

1138
01:42:54,148 --> 01:42:56,537
- What?
- Don’t be so noisy.

1139
01:42:56,868 --> 01:42:59,336
Couldn’t we even watch TV?

1140
01:43:05,788 --> 01:43:10,100
I would chuck this all up
and move out!

1141
01:43:10,708 --> 01:43:11,982
Where?

1142
01:43:12,548 --> 01:43:15,540
Dunno, doesn’t matter.
Anywhere out.

1143
01:43:16,228 --> 01:43:21,256
- Try to stand on my own feet.
- Not so simple, see.

1144
01:43:22,868 --> 01:43:25,507
Why not place an advertisement?

1145
01:43:25,828 --> 01:43:31,778
A livestock specialist and a vet
searching for a job with flat.

1146
01:43:33,308 --> 01:43:34,821
Nothing for me.

1147
01:43:39,668 --> 01:43:42,660
…will increase your charm.

1148
01:43:46,668 --> 01:43:51,184
Kohn was the first to vomit,
Ábeles second…

1149
01:43:58,148 --> 01:44:00,901
Your rickshaw, Mr. Duke!

1150
01:44:27,028 --> 01:44:29,019
It looks kinda different here.

1151
01:44:37,028 --> 01:44:40,065
Who cleaned it up?
You, Petra?

1152
01:44:44,468 --> 01:44:46,379
Why are you standing, sit down?

1153
01:44:55,428 --> 01:44:58,420
You’ve had a hard time,
now it’s gonna be all right.

1154
01:45:00,148 --> 01:45:02,298
- Won’t you take it off?
- I won’t.

1155
01:45:07,028 --> 01:45:09,098
You shouldn’t smoke.

1156
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:11,896
Well the home is the home.

1157
01:45:16,388 --> 01:45:17,503
Feuer?

1158
01:45:23,228 --> 01:45:25,344
Even I think it won’t be so bad.

1159
01:45:25,428 --> 01:45:29,580
I dropped the diet.
The main thing is a good mood!

1160
01:45:35,508 --> 01:45:38,944
I nearly forgot,
I’ve brought cakes for you.

1161
01:45:41,228 --> 01:45:42,980
Oh, really.

1162
01:45:43,108 --> 01:45:46,578
Why not feel well…

1163
01:45:46,948 --> 01:45:50,543
Why not feel well…

1164
01:45:50,868 --> 01:45:54,781
When God gives us health?

1165
01:45:56,028 --> 01:45:57,859
I can’t eat this.

1166
01:46:01,588 --> 01:46:04,182
How about taking him along
to cinema tonight?

1167
01:46:05,228 --> 01:46:08,345
Fanda will surely be able
to get one more ticket.

1168
01:46:09,748 --> 01:46:11,306
What Fanda?

1169
01:46:14,148 --> 01:46:16,104
She must mean me.

1170
01:46:20,468 --> 01:46:24,302
I'll get the ticket,
no problem.

1171
01:46:25,388 --> 01:46:28,425
I must go to bed early.
Cinema is out of question.

1172
01:46:30,068 --> 01:46:32,423
Anyway, can’t he watch the VCR?

1173
01:46:33,028 --> 01:46:35,144
To hell with the VCR.

1174
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:41,745
Or you know what?
There’s another way to…

1175
01:46:42,668 --> 01:46:43,703
cheer him up!

1176
01:46:54,028 --> 01:46:57,862
- Is Pepe here?
- Jiřinka comes to greet you.

1177
01:46:59,348 --> 01:47:00,701
Move over.

1178
01:47:01,628 --> 01:47:03,584
Well gentlemen,

1179
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:07,268
I was in the hospital…

1180
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:13,264
And the nurse, who had sampled
our blood,

1181
01:47:14,228 --> 01:47:15,343
told me,

1182
01:47:16,028 --> 01:47:19,623
that one of the tests is positive.

1183
01:47:21,588 --> 01:47:23,977
- In what way?
- AIDS positive.

1184
01:47:28,148 --> 01:47:29,979
But whose one?

1185
01:47:30,948 --> 01:47:33,223
They’re not sure,
two test-tubes were broken.

1186
01:47:33,388 --> 01:47:35,299
Wasn’t it signed?

1187
01:47:35,388 --> 01:47:38,266
If one’s positive,
it must be mine.

1188
01:47:39,428 --> 01:47:42,261
Clear as a day.
I have all the symptoms.

1189
01:47:46,148 --> 01:47:50,061
But if you have it,
She must have it as well!

1190
01:47:51,028 --> 01:47:54,065
You fuckin’ bastard!

1191
01:47:54,428 --> 01:47:57,340
I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!

1192
01:47:57,708 --> 01:48:01,223
You went to each boozer,
screwed each whore!

1193
01:48:01,468 --> 01:48:04,266
I’ll kill you!
All of you!

1194
01:48:05,828 --> 01:48:09,787
If I have it,
You all will!

1195
01:48:10,148 --> 01:48:13,379
- Lemme be!
- Stop it, he didn’t hurt you!

1196
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:17,185
- Let him be!
- Lemme be!

1197
01:48:17,548 --> 01:48:19,584
He didn’t hurt you!

1198
01:48:19,668 --> 01:48:22,740
Don’t be ridiculous, you loser.
You surely have it too!

1199
01:48:23,548 --> 01:48:25,698
You’re all the same!

1200
01:48:26,228 --> 01:48:29,698
- You as well, All the same!
- Stop it, Jiřina!

1201
01:48:38,308 --> 01:48:40,776
Fanda, wait!

1202
01:48:41,108 --> 01:48:42,666
You’re bleeding.

1203
01:48:44,628 --> 01:48:48,940
Franta, where are you going,
Take it easy.

1204
01:48:50,788 --> 01:48:53,302
Never come to see me again.
Never!

1205
01:48:53,868 --> 01:48:57,099
- But wait! - Let me be.
Didn’t Jiřina make herself clear?

1206
01:48:57,188 --> 01:48:58,860
František.

1207
01:48:59,948 --> 01:49:04,260
- Don’t you understand? - What?
- It’s a matter of life now!

1208
01:49:04,428 --> 01:49:07,261
- But you’re bleeding.
- Don’t touch me! - Wait.

1209
01:49:07,628 --> 01:49:10,859
The disease Pepe has is contagious.

1210
01:49:11,668 --> 01:49:13,545
You recoil from me?

1211
01:49:13,828 --> 01:49:16,786
It’s incurable… and mortal!

1212
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:23,826
You think I have it too?
Or what?

1213
01:49:25,428 --> 01:49:27,896
It isn’t possible, is it?

1214
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:33,548
Am I not perfectly healthy?
I feel fine.

1215
01:49:34,108 --> 01:49:37,259
I’m sure I’m not ill,
see?

1216
01:49:38,228 --> 01:49:39,820
You don’t need to worry.

1217
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:43,376
Let me be!

1218
01:49:45,108 --> 01:49:47,906
- It’s that you don’t love me,
right? - Don’t touch me.

1219
01:49:47,988 --> 01:49:49,626
Did something change?

1220
01:49:50,708 --> 01:49:53,222
Everything’s changed, see?

1221
01:49:53,468 --> 01:49:55,823
Everything’s different!

1222
01:49:56,188 --> 01:49:59,624
- Nothing is valid anymore.
- I hate you.

1223
01:50:21,028 --> 01:50:23,178
Well, I think I'll go.

1224
01:50:25,548 --> 01:50:26,822
Bye.

1225
01:50:27,508 --> 01:50:29,624
Bye.

1226
01:50:31,788 --> 01:50:34,348
You won’t need this, will you?

1227
01:50:35,548 --> 01:50:39,621
So I'll drop by, someday?

1228
01:50:40,548 --> 01:50:44,507
- Sure you don’t want this?
- Just take it. - Thanks, bye.

1229
01:51:16,028 --> 01:51:18,781
Jiřina, Wait… Please!

1230
01:51:19,108 --> 01:51:22,066
- What?
- Give me a minute, please.

1231
01:51:22,468 --> 01:51:28,225
Easy. Anyway, you don’t
have to worry at all.

1232
01:51:31,228 --> 01:51:34,220
How comforting
when it’s you who says so.

1233
01:51:34,668 --> 01:51:38,104
See… Pepe never wanted to
be a father.

1234
01:51:39,308 --> 01:51:43,381
- So what?
- He mustn’t have relied only on you.

1235
01:51:46,028 --> 01:51:51,546
- Speak even louder, goddamn it.
- He surely always used contraceptives.

1236
01:51:53,788 --> 01:51:58,703
- Don’t be pathetic, you asshole.
- Wait, I have to ask you something.

1237
01:51:58,788 --> 01:52:01,063
I mean it! Stop please.

1238
01:52:01,468 --> 01:52:05,097
You know, the last time we saw
each other…

1239
01:52:06,228 --> 01:52:10,540
Could you tell me what happened?
I can’t remember a thing.

1240
01:52:11,788 --> 01:52:14,586
I’m not gonna console you,
you coward.

1241
01:52:19,748 --> 01:52:22,421
Blood… the bitch!

1242
01:52:31,068 --> 01:52:32,786
Bitch…

1243
01:52:41,708 --> 01:52:44,859
Oh, I had no idea,

1244
01:52:44,948 --> 01:52:48,179
you can sprinkle in such a lovely
way, Mr. Málek.

1245
01:52:48,268 --> 01:52:50,987
Buzz off, you old hag!

1246
01:52:53,828 --> 01:52:58,583
I don’t care a bit about you,
you sleazy earthworm!

1247
01:53:03,388 --> 01:53:05,140
- Is Hanka here?
- No.

1248
01:53:06,988 --> 01:53:08,626
She isn’t!

1249
01:53:10,708 --> 01:53:13,984
- How come?
- She had a visit, will be right back.

1250
01:53:14,228 --> 01:53:17,220
- Was it friend or a relative?
- I don’t know.

1251
01:53:17,308 --> 01:53:21,506
A kind of hotshot, see? There’s always 
one around a young beauty.

1252
01:53:21,588 --> 01:53:22,782
Please…

1253
01:53:25,028 --> 01:53:28,259
Man, You’ll kill yourself at work.

1254
01:53:36,188 --> 01:53:38,702
It’s not your business.
You have no right to do this!

1255
01:53:39,108 --> 01:53:42,657
- We can make a deal. - I’m done with
you. - Don’t be hysteric.

1256
01:53:42,868 --> 01:53:48,022
- Let go. - Look, this is
serious business, See?

1257
01:53:48,108 --> 01:53:50,702
- You promised to let me be.
- He’s a huge moneybag, see!

1258
01:53:50,828 --> 01:53:52,625
- What’s wrong?
- I don’t want to anymore!

1259
01:53:52,748 --> 01:53:55,057
- It’s the last time, see?
- No!

1260
01:53:55,268 --> 01:54:00,547
You don’t want us to tell
the sucker of yours, do you?

1261
01:54:06,828 --> 01:54:10,184
Let him be!
I hate you!

1262
01:54:13,108 --> 01:54:15,781
Let him go!

1263
01:54:22,548 --> 01:54:24,106
I’ll find you, bitch!

1264
01:54:29,068 --> 01:54:32,458
- There’s blood on you.
- Where? Wait, damn.

1265
01:54:34,308 --> 01:54:38,142
- Here, I'll clean it.
- No, don’t touch me!

1266
01:54:38,588 --> 01:54:41,705
- Why?
- It’s dangerous.

1267
01:54:42,388 --> 01:54:45,937
- It’s been found out some of us
have it. - What?

1268
01:54:47,948 --> 01:54:51,145
- AIDS?
- Maybe me.

1269
01:54:54,108 --> 01:54:57,145
Or me, huh?

1270
01:55:01,428 --> 01:55:05,501
What will we do?

1271
01:55:06,428 --> 01:55:09,625
Jesus, what will we do now?

1272
01:55:10,548 --> 01:55:13,426
What will we do? Jesus Christ!

1273
01:55:14,028 --> 01:55:18,977
What will we do?!

1274
01:55:19,788 --> 01:55:23,417
We have to do something, Milan!

1275
01:55:24,268 --> 01:55:28,500
Come on, it’s all useless.
Nothing matters anymore.

1276
01:55:28,828 --> 01:55:31,183
What do you mean, useless?

1277
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:34,585
You don’t believe me.

1278
01:55:34,908 --> 01:55:39,220
I knew you wouldn’t.

1279
01:55:40,068 --> 01:55:44,107
I worried so much.
So much…

1280
01:55:45,228 --> 01:55:47,617
That you would leave me.

1281
01:55:51,948 --> 01:55:55,384
And what’s the worst,
I still love you.

1282
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:03,303
Please. Let’s leave! Outta here!

1283
01:56:03,388 --> 01:56:08,098
You can’t escape this.
Where could you escape this?

1284
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:10,699
Where?
What do you wanna do? Where?

1285
01:56:10,788 --> 01:56:13,177
It’s all useless anyway!
Nothing matters at all!

1286
01:56:13,268 --> 01:56:16,066
Nothing matters!

1287
01:56:16,628 --> 01:56:19,825
I’ll give it all up!
But I don’t want to!

1288
01:56:20,908 --> 01:56:25,106
- Everything’s useless!
- I can’t stand this uncertainty!

1289
01:56:27,308 --> 01:56:28,980
Next one, please.

1290
01:56:31,788 --> 01:56:33,904
It’s you?

1291
01:56:34,908 --> 01:56:36,819
Yeah, it’s me.

1292
01:57:04,388 --> 01:57:07,460
- You're leaving?
- Going home.

1293
01:57:10,028 --> 01:57:13,782
- Wouldn’t it be better to find out?
- What for?

1294
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:17,417
You would be certain.

1295
01:57:18,468 --> 01:57:21,744
Certain that I have it?
I’m not interested.

1296
01:57:23,508 --> 01:57:26,978
It’d be fair for others at least.

1297
01:57:28,348 --> 01:57:30,657
Look who’s talking!

1298
01:59:02,748 --> 01:59:06,297
Jiřina, is it you? Jiřina!

1299
01:59:08,668 --> 01:59:12,502
- Hi, how are you?
- Well, and you?

1300
01:59:12,708 --> 01:59:17,828
- Well also, you coward.
It’s good. - It’s good, good!

1301
01:59:18,108 --> 01:59:21,020
- It’s negative!
- It’s negative!

1302
01:59:21,268 --> 01:59:25,307
- It’s good!
- It’s negative!

1303
01:59:26,708 --> 01:59:29,461
- Negative!
- Negative!

1304
01:59:31,548 --> 01:59:33,743
Banzai!

1305
01:59:34,628 --> 01:59:37,301
It’s negative!

1306
02:00:14,988 --> 02:00:19,345
- What are you eating?
- Rice mash. Want some?

1307
02:00:20,228 --> 02:00:23,379
No way.
I have to lose some weight, bro.

1308
02:00:32,668 --> 02:00:35,023
I thought you stopped the diet.

1309
02:00:35,308 --> 02:00:39,142
Well yeah but I came to you 
to say good bye.

1310
02:00:52,428 --> 02:00:55,500
- I’m going with Hanka to Šumava.
Did I tell you? - That’s great.

1311
02:00:55,588 --> 02:00:58,500
We’re gonna get married. Really.
Hanka is a great girl.

1312
02:00:58,588 --> 02:01:03,184
She set up everything.
Even the terms.

1313
02:01:04,108 --> 02:01:06,019
I hope you’ll come.

1314
02:01:08,508 --> 02:01:11,818
Man, you look better now, know it?
Really!

1315
02:01:12,868 --> 02:01:15,177
- What’s wrong?
- Nothing.

1316
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:19,466
And I guess you’ve gained weight.
What do doctors say?

1317
02:01:20,468 --> 02:01:22,106
Still the same.

1318
02:01:22,228 --> 02:01:25,265
“Diet”, “take care of yourself” etc.

1319
02:01:26,468 --> 02:01:28,618
I hate always going there.

1320
02:01:30,108 --> 02:01:32,827
No wonder, but…

1321
02:01:33,388 --> 02:01:35,185
You need a change, anything.

1322
02:01:35,268 --> 02:01:41,867
Why not come to see František and
have a good-bye party?

1323
02:01:44,508 --> 02:01:47,466
Come, we’ll have some fun again.
Stop it, come on.

1324
02:01:47,828 --> 02:01:50,945
- It’s just so interesting now.
- I can see it.

1325
02:02:09,828 --> 02:02:13,298
Even art reached the
cul-de-sac?

1326
02:02:16,148 --> 02:02:18,218
You’re terrible.

1327
02:02:22,148 --> 02:02:25,106
You’re all terrible.

1328
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:29,222
Everything is terrible.

1329
02:02:34,108 --> 02:02:36,178
Or a love drama perhaps?

1330
02:02:37,548 --> 02:02:40,301
I wouldn’t laugh if I were you, man.

1331
02:02:41,508 --> 02:02:45,820
- You’re involved too.
- Me? In what?

1332
02:02:46,548 --> 02:02:49,745
The director canceled the engagement,
Jana’s pregnant.

1333
02:02:50,148 --> 02:02:52,901
- So it’s yours.
- Or yours.

1334
02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:58,099
- If Janička told the truth.
- Or yours.

1335
02:03:00,508 --> 02:03:02,226
Here it is…

1336
02:03:04,988 --> 02:03:06,785
Me…

1337
02:03:07,828 --> 02:03:09,147
and a child?

1338
02:03:12,628 --> 02:03:14,619
My child?

1339
02:03:16,868 --> 02:03:19,177
You think,

1340
02:03:20,228 --> 02:03:24,506
that I could have a child?

1341
02:03:26,068 --> 02:03:28,536
We don’t know who’s the father yet.

1342
02:03:29,348 --> 02:03:32,067
What’s worse, the director requested
Jana’s test and…

1343
02:03:32,468 --> 02:03:34,538
found out Jana’s AIDS positive.

1344
02:03:34,628 --> 02:03:36,823
The child as well undoubtedly,
so we’re all involved!

1345
02:03:36,908 --> 02:03:39,980
But not me, no way!

1346
02:03:40,268 --> 02:03:44,147
Hanička get herself tested and
Jiřina is also po… I mean negative.

1347
02:03:44,428 --> 02:03:46,623
Me, no way.

1348
02:03:46,708 --> 02:03:49,541
They’d have it both then!
We’re gonna get married!

1349
02:03:50,788 --> 02:03:53,177
We're going to the country!
We're going away!

1350
02:03:53,428 --> 02:03:55,623
Settle this stuff with one another,
gentlemen!

1351
02:03:55,788 --> 02:03:58,666
I don't give a damn.
Have a nice day, ciao!

1352
02:03:59,068 --> 02:04:01,707
So it’s your fault, you bastard.

1353
02:04:03,188 --> 02:04:04,860
Get the fuck outta here!

1354
02:04:05,548 --> 02:04:08,745
Damn, we’re all involved.

1355
02:04:09,428 --> 02:04:13,182
Even me. Me!
But why the hell me?!

1356
02:05:03,628 --> 02:05:05,903
Come on, now what?

1357
02:05:06,508 --> 02:05:08,146
But it’s nothing.

1358
02:05:08,508 --> 02:05:11,022
No one’s ever died because of
a tiny drop of blood.

1359
02:05:11,108 --> 02:05:12,427
- It hurts!
- Be quiet!
