1
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,999
HEAT WAVE

2
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,788
Aren't you napping?

3
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,959
I can't sleep.
Anyway, it's too hot.

4
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,278
If only you slept at night.

5
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,632
- I must run or I'll be late.
- Will you be home late?

6
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,796
I'm working 3 to 9 tonight.

7
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,955
Bye, Ma.

8
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,551
It's a new kind of pregnancy test.

9
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,757
Do you know how to use it?

10
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,710
Thanks.

11
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,915
How much is it?

12
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,235
9.90.

13
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,749
Thank you.

14
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,631
Bye.

15
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,114
Sorry I'm late.

16
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,435
No trouble.

17
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,599
I get so bored on my breaks,
I do nothing but eat!

18
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,872
Can I take 15 more minutes?

19
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,428
As long as you like.

20
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,115
I'll pay you back.

21
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,595
Miss!

22
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,153
Please!

23
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,872
Hello. So you work here?

24
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,229
Only for the summer.

25
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,274
Could you reach me
that bottle of milk?

26
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,677
Not that one! Glass is better.

27
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,830
This one?

28
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,596
Damn it! Can't you watch out?

29
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,953
Amelie, it's Ma here.

30
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,718
I know you're at work.

31
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,629
I've had to go to Aix.
My sister's taken ill.

32
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,958
Nothing serious,
but the kids need looking after.

33
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,832
Philippe's disappeared again.

34
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,636
Don't stay out too late, OK?

35
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,272
I've cooked you
some stew and macaroni,

36
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,392
and you can finish the tomato tart.

37
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,672
Don't warm it in the microwave,
it'll go soggy,

38
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,110
but you can microwave
the stew and pasta.

39
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,275
Invite Luigi if you like.

40
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,909
Take care, love.

41
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,510
I should be home tomorrow evening.

42
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,554
Could you hang out the washing
in the machine?

43
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,759
Lots of love.

44
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,036
Thank you.

45
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,195
Goodbye.

46
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,115
Everything OK?

47
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,034
Amelie!

48
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,232
Aren't you at football?

49
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,078
No. We need to talk.

50
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,798
Not now, Luigi. I'm working.

51
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,154
I had to work late
so I missed your break.

52
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,194
It's important.
Can't somebody sub for you?

53
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,839
No.
Come round tonight if you want.

54
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,436
Please, just five minutes.

55
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,237
Luigi, go away or I'll get fired.

56
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,070
There you go.

57
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,195
I think you've given me too much.

58
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,798
Oh yes. Thanks.

59
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,669
Ten euros.

60
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,389
Thank you.

61
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,431
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

62
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,352
I've only got this.

63
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,471
Mind if I go first?

64
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,318
Will you listen to me now?

65
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,199
1.09, please.

66
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,912
What?

67
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,519
Coke is 1.09.

68
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,476
Moron!

69
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,513
I come to say I'm leaving
and you sell me a Coke.

70
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,559
Keep your job.

71
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,749
Luigi!

72
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,869
Follow us, please.

73
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,196
Luigi!

74
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,274
Meet me behind the store.
The loading bay.

75
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,513
11 euros 82.

76
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,673
I'm closed, madam.

77
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,517
What?

78
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,870
This till is closed.
I'm sorry.

79
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,674
You're joking.
I've been waiting ten minutes!

80
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,118
I'm not moving.

81
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
Call your manager.
I'm staying right here.

82
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,788
Switchboard.

83
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,151
Amelie, checkout 3.
Can you come? I feel sick.

84
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,679
I'll send someone.

85
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,716
- For God's...
- She's coming, OK?

86
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,998
Supervisor to checkout 3, please.

87
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,111
Hello.

88
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,033
- Something wrong?
- She won't take me.

89
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,673
I feel sick. Can I go home?

90
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,757
See to this lady.
Then you can close.

91
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,315
I said I feel sick.
I want to go home.

92
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,999
This is very unlike you.

93
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,519
Yes, well it happens.

94
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,995
Finish your work
and then we'll talk.

95
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,678
I'll check you out myself, madam.

96
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,679
This is ridiculous!

97
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,599
You can close, Amelie.

98
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,636
Till 3 is 250 euros short.

99
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,030
What?

100
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,950
It can't be.
I double checked.

101
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,952
It can't be!

102
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,394
Relax. Maybe it's a mistake.

103
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,835
I'll count again.

104
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,393
Sorry!

105
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,238
I forgot to count the float.

106
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,429
I'm sorry.

107
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,036
Hello,
you've reached Anne Gasquet.

108
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,832
I can't take your call now,

109
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,953
but please leave a message
after the tone.

110
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,714
Ma, it's Amelie.
Why don't you ever answer?

111
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,432
I'm coming home.
I feel sick and nauseous.

112
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,110
Call me when you get this.

113
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,788
I think I'm pregnant.

114
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,070
Good afternoon.

115
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,119
- Is Luigi here?
- He's out.

116
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,710
You can come in and wait.

117
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,919
No need. I'll come back.

118
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,196
Goodbye.

119
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,675
Hi.

120
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,108
Are you feeling OK?

121
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,958
I'm all right.

122
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,668
Want a lift?

123
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,995
Thank you.

124
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,315
Sorry about the milk.

125
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,555
Never mind.

126
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,072
Hassan, have you seen Luigi?

127
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,951
No.

128
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,309
Amelie?

129
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,589
It's me.

130
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,835
Open up.

131
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,755
Open up!

132
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,474
I know you're there.
I saw your car outside.

133
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,512
Please let me in.

134
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,749
Let me in!

135
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,990
Amelie! I know you're in there.

136
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,030
Don't.

137
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,999
It's gridlock.

138
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,159
I'll have to let you out.

139
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,395
Is it far?

140
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,034
Not if you take the back streets.

141
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,034
How much is that?

142
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,595
35 euros.

143
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,629
Thank you.

144
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,996
What's this?

145
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,715
Baklava. Made of almonds, honey,
orange blossom water, and sugar.

146
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,875
I'll take two.

147
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,069
Anything else?

148
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,599
Two krone el ghazal...

149
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,876
And one of those.

150
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,314
Will that be all?

151
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,474
That's 5.30, please.

152
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,709
Taxi!

153
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,476
Excuse me! I need to get off.

154
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,915
The door, please!

155
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,109
Careful, madam.

156
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,435
Sorry.

157
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,994
The door!

158
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,197
Dr. Altman will see you soon.

159
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,431
First we'll take a blood sample.

160
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,631
- Your stomach's empty, right?
- Yes.

161
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,998
Your room is here.
You're lucky to be first in line.

162
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,954
I'll be back
to take you to the doctor.

163
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,635
Thank you.

164
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,912
Slip this on.

165
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,916
I brought one with me.

166
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,273
This one is better for examinations.

167
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,152
And no earrings, please.

168
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,156
Thank you.

169
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,472
This is Amelie's voicemail.
You can leave a message.

170
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,799
Amelie, it's Ma.

171
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,592
I know you're at work.

172
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,030
I've had to go to Aix.

173
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,470
My sister's taken ill.
Nothing serious,

174
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,511
but the kids need looking after.

175
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,869
She's on her own.

176
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,071
Philippe's disappeared again.

177
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,635
Don't stay out too late, OK?

178
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,232
I've cooked you
some stew and macaroni,

179
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,238
and you can finish the tomato tart.

180
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,352
Don't warm it in the microwave,
it'll go soggy,

181
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,950
but you can microwave
the stew and pasta.

182
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,318
Invite Luigi if you like.

183
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,515
Take care, love.

184
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,196
I should be home tomorrow evening.

185
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,917
Could you hang out the washing
in the machine?

186
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,355
Thanks.

187
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,599
Lots of love.

188
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,510
Dad?

189
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,876
Where's Stephane?

190
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,479
Draining the 'dozer.

191
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,595
Make yourself useful.

192
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,193
Still at it?

193
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,833
I'm fuckin' sick of this.

194
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,312
No way to earn a living.

195
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,118
Smothered in grease...

196
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,036
Gimme a hand?

197
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,715
Luigi!

198
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,270
Come here.

199
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,111
After your shift, I need you and
your cousin to clear out the shed.

200
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,355
OK, Dad.

201
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,436
We'd finish sooner
if you did some work.

202
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,675
Fuck it.

203
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,152
Our first day
and you're moaning.

204
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,670
It's exploitation!
And we'll be late for football.

205
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,356
You playing tonight?

206
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,676
I'm seeing Amelie.
I'll meet you later.

207
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,438
She's all you think about!

208
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,956
I don't switch girls every day.

209
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,311
I do, 'cause I like virgins.

210
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,353
They turn me on.

211
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,950
Did you pop Amelie's cherry?

212
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,748
- I bet she never sucks you.
- Shut it!

213
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,717
She doesn't look the sort.

214
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,078
Fuck! Stephane!

215
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,998
Get a fire extinguisher!

216
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,635
Dad!

217
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,353
The shed's on fire!

218
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,475
Stephane!

219
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,754
- What happened?
- Nothing.

220
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,836
Speak up.

221
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,039
What happened?

222
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,351
Sorry.

223
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,356
What?

224
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,955
I said I'm sorry!

225
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,590
Jump on!

226
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,438
Leave me alone!

227
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,358
Don't be a dick.

228
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,310
You OK?

229
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,636
Fuckin' leave me alone!

230
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,399
My ankle!

231
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,230
Come on.

232
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,594
Get on.

233
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,156
OK?

234
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,194
You need a hospital?

235
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,438
Just leave me alone.

236
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,669
Mamma, it's me.

237
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,756
Not so good.

238
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,349
It's Dad.

239
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,278
I can't stay here.

240
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,909
I quit the job.

241
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,713
I've got to go.

242
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,078
I'll tell you later.

243
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,197
I'll explain everything.
Let me come home.

244
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,792
If I take the train tonight,
I'll arrive tomorrow morning.

245
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,278
I can't stay here.

246
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,876
Dad doesn't know.

247
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,835
Don't phone him.
I'll tell him myself.

248
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,356
I'll tell him
before I take the train tonight.

249
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,109
I promise.

250
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,194
Some.
Stephane will lend me the rest.

251
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,835
I'll call you when I arrive.

252
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,715
Kisses.

253
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,035
Mamma...

254
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,673
Nothing.

255
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,439
I love you.

256
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,308
Who was that?

257
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,188
My mother.

258
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,996
- Lend me some clothes?
- Sure.

259
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,269
This one?

260
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,718
Ready to go?

261
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,039
Wait for me here.

262
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,275
Amelie!

263
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,594
- Aren't you at football?
- We need to talk.

264
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,199
Not now. I'm working.

265
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,710
We had to work late
so I missed your break.

266
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,279
Can't somebody sub for you?

267
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,196
No.

268
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,193
Come round tonight.

269
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,352
Please, just five minutes.

270
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,995
Five minutes.

271
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,432
Go away or I'll get fired.

272
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,276
Go on.

273
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,954
Keep your job!

274
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,669
Luigi, wait!

275
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,151
Meet me behind the store.
The loading bay.

276
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,032
Where the fuck is she?

277
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,433
I need to see Amelie, the blonde
checkout clerk, you know?

278
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,914
There's no entry here.

279
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,710
Please let me in.
I hurt my ankle. I can't walk far.

280
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,832
You know Amelie.
The tall, blonde checkout clerk.

281
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,916
It's the rules.

282
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,237
You know her.
Can't you get her for me?

283
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,589
I can't.

284
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,950
I know you're doing your job
but it's not much to ask.

285
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,309
Back off, please.

286
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,950
Shut your faggot face.

287
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,315
Beat it!

288
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,518
Can't you give
that fuckin' ball a rest?

289
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,948
What's the matter?

290
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:20,877
Nothing!

291
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,513
Did she agree to go with you?

292
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,789
Let's go.

293
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,479
Casarsa? Where's that?

294
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,113
In Friuli, Italy.

295
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,038
Italy...

296
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,909
Can you spell it?

297
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,119
C-A-S-A-R-S-A.

298
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,638
- Can I come?
- No.

299
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,269
Leaving when, sir?

300
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,232
Now. This evening.

301
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,997
There's no direct train, sir.

302
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,395
You'll have to change at Venice.

303
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,999
The first train leaves tomorrow...

304
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,349
at 10:32.

305
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,039
I need to leave now.

306
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,196
There's no other train, I'm afraid.

307
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,959
You can stay at my place.

308
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,910
Would you like to book a seat?

309
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,389
Sir?

310
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,836
Are we going to play or not?

311
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,316
I can't. I hurt my ankle.

312
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,112
We've been waiting an hour.

313
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,835
Amelie.

314
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,268
It's me.

315
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,469
Open up.

316
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,196
Amelie!

317
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,312
I know you're there.
I saw your car outside.

318
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,676
Please let me in.

319
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,833
What happened to your cheek?

320
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,516
The stupid security guard.

321
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,713
He did my face in.

322
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,593
Why are you leaving?

323
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,199
I've got no choice.

324
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,477
My dad hit me.

325
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,474
I'm not running away.
I'm going back home.

326
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,954
Come with me.

327
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,558
Don't ask me to.

328
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,474
That tickles.

329
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,919
Meet me outside?

330
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,234
You can decide about Italy
in a few days.

331
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,316
Are you playing?

332
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,919
I can't. I hurt my leg.

333
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,235
Afraid to lose?

334
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,158
No, it's true. I swear.

335
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,990
Pick teams?

336
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,394
OK, you first.

337
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,034
I'll take Dorian.

338
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,749
I'll take Issam.

339
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,755
Romain.

340
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,070
Flo.

341
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,915
Can't I play?

342
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,758
- You're useless.
- You can be ref.

343
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,871
I've been waiting to play
for an hour.

344
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,399
We'll shoot penalties.

345
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,112
In the old man's gateway.

346
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,309
The spot's here.

347
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,909
OK.

348
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,199
Nice one!

349
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,754
Yay! It's in there.

350
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,470
Don't shoot so hard.

351
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,554
128 kilos.

352
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,557
I feel chilly.
May I get dressed?

353
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,795
Please do.

354
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,552
As I said before,
it's not really an operation.

355
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,957
The gastric balloon
is fitted without surgery.

356
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,080
- You've seen the anaesthetist?
- Last week.

357
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,115
I can't see any problem,
so here's what we'll do.

358
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,752
I perform an endoscopy
under general anaesthetic.

359
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,598
If I don't see anything wrong,

360
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,315
I insert the balloon in your stomach
and fill it with fluid.

361
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,556
It only takes about 20 minutes.

362
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,639
We monitor you for a few hours.
If all is well, you go home.

363
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,435
We do an X-ray follow- up
a few days later.

364
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,313
The balloon will make
your stomach feel full,

365
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,439
so you won't feel hungry.

366
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,918
After about six months,
I'll remove it.

367
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,037
How much weight will I lose?

368
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,799
A substantial amount
in the first six months.

369
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,868
After that, it will depend on you,

370
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,631
your future eating habits
and how much exercise you take.

371
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,111
You'll meet regularly with our staff

372
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,677
to help you control your weight
and stay fit.

373
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,837
They'll give you dietary advice
and psychological support.

374
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,311
That's all.

375
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,351
I'll see you later in the theatre.

376
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,679
One last thing, which I'm sure
you've already been told.

377
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,872
No food before the operation.
It could be dangerous.

378
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,835
Excuse me, Miss!
You work here?

379
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,236
Can you reach me
a bottle of milk?

380
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,557
Not that one!
Glass is better.

381
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,350
Damn it! Can't you watch out?

382
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,999
How much is that?

383
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,315
22.50, please.

384
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,396
Amelie!

385
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,074
We need to talk.

386
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,718
Your receipt and change.

387
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,358
Good afternoon, sir.

388
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,629
Store security.

389
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,717
May I see your receipt, please?

390
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,150
Thank you.

391
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,555
Stand back please, sir.

392
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,116
Do you mind if I take a look?

393
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,791
Just checking your purchases
against the receipt.

394
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,119
It shouldn't take long.

395
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,029
Wine...

396
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,389
Mineral water...

397
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,230
Go through the gate again, please.

398
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,668
This way, sir.

399
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,789
And now back again.

400
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,989
Please.

401
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,229
Thank you.

402
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,515
What's this about?

403
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,712
Just a routine check, sir.
Please come with us.

404
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,959
Bring your bag to the security room,
just for a minute.

405
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,275
Go ahead.

406
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,074
Thank you, sir.

407
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,389
Excuse us.

408
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,359
Wait, Luigi!

409
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,629
Come in.

410
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,554
Good afternoon, sir.

411
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,991
Please watch the screen.

412
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,556
Is that you?

413
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,239
I can't see without my glasses.

414
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,238
I don't need glasses
to see you stealing a CD.

415
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,237
Are you calling me a thief?

416
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,637
We've got the video
and you triggered the alarm.

417
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,236
I was a union shop steward.

418
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,478
You owe me respect, young man.

419
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,477
If I say I stole nothing,
it's true.

420
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,319
Not all shoplifters are trash,
you know.

421
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,590
We catch teachers,
ladies, cops' wives...

422
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,789
Let me go.

423
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,513
Why not shop stewards?

424
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,555
OK, strip. Gimme your coat.

425
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,919
Gimme your coat.

426
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,794
Arms wide.

427
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,439
Nothing there.

428
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,393
What's this, then?

429
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,798
Mozart's 23rd concerto
by Arthur Rubinstein. Heard of it?

430
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,633
Is that all you took?

431
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,672
Let's see. Shirt off.

432
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,829
Hurry up.

433
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,039
And your teeshirt.

434
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,309
Trousers.

435
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,636
What big balls you've got, Grandpa!
Out with it.

436
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,597
Pretending you've got a big one?

437
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,796
A leaky dick, more likely.

438
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,999
Now we know you're clean.
Turn around.

439
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,193
Nothing there either.

440
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,995
Get dressed.

441
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,515
Gramps!

442
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,949
The CD...

443
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,878
You buy it, you keep it.

444
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,553
Pick up your padding.

445
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,637
Till 3 is 250 euros short.

446
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,316
What?

447
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:30,950
It can't be.

448
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,790
Hi.

449
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,468
Are you feeling OK?

450
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,557
I'm all right.

451
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,749
Want a lift?

452
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,073
Yay! It's in there.

453
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,237
Dear Ma, I got your message.

454
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,228
By the time you get home,
I'll have gone to Italy with Luigi.

455
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,032
I'll phone you to explain.

456
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,151
Don't be sad. I have no choice.

457
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,634
Lots of love,
Amelie.

458
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:21,316
Good shot.

459
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,909
Nice try, Youssef!

460
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,312
Watch and dream.

461
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:38,910
Goalie saves.

462
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,834
Can't you even hit
a goal that big?

463
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,871
Show him where to fuckin' shoot!

464
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,509
Shoot straight.

465
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,233
Make my day.

466
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,271
Look at that!
