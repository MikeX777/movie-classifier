00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:58,736
That,

3
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:02,771
that is what I like to see.

4
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:03,574
Passion!

5
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:05,876
You guys,

6
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,348
you guys fought for every
square inch of the ice tonight.

7
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,152
You let them know they
were in our house!

8
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:23,126
How about Justin here
taking the lead as always.

9
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:30,399
And Matty, Matty absolutely
bleeding for it in the corners.

10
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:36,539
And how about these two
young guns over here,

11
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,907
Tyson and Schultzy banking
in those hard minutes

12
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,209
at the end of the second.

13
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,544
Let's give it over.

14
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,853
I think we all know who this
hardware goes to tonight.

15
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,487
Let's give it over.

16
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,562
Way to go.

17
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,331
King for our knights!

18
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:11,440
That's how the
fucking warriors do it!

19
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,277
Yeah!

20
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:18,814
Harper, you know what Yeezy
says, watch the throne baby.

21
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:21,450
I'm coming for that crown bud.

22
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,752
You get hit in the head too
many times tonight Schultzy?

23
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,020
Or are you still spinning
from when that guy

24
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:26,522
turned you inside out out there.

25
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:27,756
You don't know
what you're talking about bro.

26
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,325
That there is
an education bud.

27
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,060
Playing with the big boys now.

28
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:33,862
Yeah big boys,
that's for sure eh?

29
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:36,232
Your fucking fat ass can
hardly get up and down the ice.

30
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:37,466
You little bitch.

31
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:41,106
Easy boys, give it a
rest, Dylan have a seat.

32
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,909
Alright as you all know

33
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:48,511
I take a lot of pride
in wearing the C.

34
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,879
It means a lot more to me than
just a letter on my jersey,

35
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,281
just like coach always
says, everyone has a role,

36
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:55,784
and every role has
it's responsibility.

37
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:59,957
So I want you rookies to
get up there for a minute.

38
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:08,431
Look we've all been
rookies before,

39
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,832
we all know what it's like.

40
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:13,836
New town, new teammates,
we've all been there.

41
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:17,140
You boys have shown
us a lot so far.

42
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:19,310
We're proud of you, and so

43
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:22,880
as is tradition

44
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:26,482
a proper Warriors welcome
means we gotta scalp em!

45
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,065
Come on!

46
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,208
Mother fucker!

47
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,369
Ahh!

48
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,788
Won't stop now boy!

49
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:23,165
Oh crying for your mother huh?

50
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,633
Hey Wendy.

51
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,834
Looks like
this little devil

52
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,270
has been keeping you occupied.

53
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:29,137
He's good, tons of fun huh?

54
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,408
Thank you for
keeping an eye on him.

55
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,877
Let me give you
a hand with that.

56
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,048
Thank you, that's
very sweet of you.

57
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,268
- Is Cody home?
- Huh?

58
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,136
Is Cody here?

59
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:05,310
Uh no, I think he went over
to Tracy's after practice.

60
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,013
Left you all alone huh?

61
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:11,081
I guess.

62
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,456
Hey Bill.

63
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,690
Hey, hey.

64
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,491
Can I give you
a hand with that?

65
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,360
Sure, thank you.

66
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:25,861
Just get it down to
the crawl space there.

67
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:26,697
Hey.

68
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,602
Hold on, hold on, okay.

69
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:49,745
The theme of the
game this week is focus.

70
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:52,748
If I'm gonna play on the
fourth line I need to be

71
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,854
so concentrated, so in
tune with what's going on.

72
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:00,357
Party.

73
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:52,069
Is your head still tingling
from that fucking yeti hit?

74
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,608
No man, I'm fine.

75
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:10,252
You know that ringing sound

76
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,921
when everything
is totally quiet?

77
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,525
What do you mean?

78
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,161
When like if you're
all alone somewhere,

79
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:23,267
and everything's completely
silent, like nothing.

80
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,341
Not like this cause
the heater's going

81
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:36,681
but if it's actually
quiet like nothing.

82
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:44,722
Yeah no I think I know
what you mean it's just that,

83
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,191
it's like your ears
or something right?

84
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:50,726
Yeah.

85
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:54,565
Like that type of ringing
is just you hear nothing,

86
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,232
or something like that.

87
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:58,368
Pretty much.

88
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:02,437
I used to hate that
when I was a kid though.

89
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,006
Oh yeah?

90
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:07,712
Yeah I just, I don't know
it just really bothered me.

91
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:12,447
- Huh.
- Still makes me feel weird.

92
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,283
Oh yeah?

93
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:16,186
Yeah.

94
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:21,525
I get really sick to
my stomach and sweaty.

95
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,597
It would feel like,

96
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,700
I don't know like what a
black hole would feel like,

97
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,936
or something, can't
really explain it.

98
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:34,772
Huh.

99
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:40,075
I get all freaked
out and scared,

100
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:42,845
so my parents would have
to put on this music

101
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:46,949
so I would like relax and
eventually fall asleep.

102
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:49,785
Oh yeah, what type of music
would they play for you?

103
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:51,754
Didn't matter.

104
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:55,691
Anything, just like
any sound, any noise

105
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,228
just to drown out that ringing.

106
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,932
Yeah I
don't know I never,

107
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:07,903
never really had any problems
sleeping when I was a kid,

108
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:10,572
I was always super afraid
of heights actually.

109
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:14,142
But yeah, never scared of the
dark or anything like that.

110
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,779
I didn't say I was
cared of the dark.

111
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:20,050
I don't
know, I don't know.

112
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:24,419
Its just that sound of like,

113
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:28,592
the way I feel when I hear
that sound, like nothing.

114
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,876
I'm not trying to freak
you out right now man.

115
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:52,316
- You're good.
- Alrighty.

116
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:55,052
Night buddy.

117
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:08,630
That a boy that a boy.

118
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:09,433

119
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:37,760
Oh man, you killed that
man, nice work man.

120
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:38,763
Thank you.

121
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:02,885
What's up baby boy?

122
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:03,720
Woo!

123
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,756
Where's the knock back?

124
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,825
Hey nobody can left
your ugly ass bro.

125
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,927
Hey you know what
kid you talk too much,

126
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,862

00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:15,964
Such a
fucking charity case huh?

128
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,232
What you say?

129
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:18,100
Hey you
little whipping boy.

130
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,502
Don't take it out on me.

131
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,104
You shut your mouth or I'm
gonna sick the boy on you.

132
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:24,873

00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,575
you fat fuck.

135
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,344
At least I'm not from
fucking Maple Ridge

136
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,779

137
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:33,949
You gotta fucking problem,

Which way you going?

140
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,054
Why don't you take out
what's in front of you?

141
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,823
That's right.

142
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:42,657
Oh hey watch it.

143
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,184
Fuck yeah!

144
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,055
Busted eh boys?

145
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:55,397
You boys are lucky this
guy's a lawyer and not a cop.

146
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,902
Relax boys I'm on your side.

147
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:01,536
These are
the young princes.

148
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:04,839
Oh, they make a lot
bigger now a days don't they?

149
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,341
No kidding.

150
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:08,276
Wendy said she wanted to get
a Rottweiler for the house

151
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,811
or something, I said
why don't you just get

152
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:11,613
a couple of hockey players.

153
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,420
They already come house trained.

154
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,625
More or less eh boys.

155
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,997
Don't worry I won't tell nobody.

156
00:17:30,234 --> 00:17:32,434
K, goodnight fellas.

157
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,671
- Night Bill.
- Night night.

158
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,388
Bricks and mortar.

159
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,191
These things.

160
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,661
They're important right?

161
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:04,034
They are important because we
are building something here.

162
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,139
We're building
something that is great.

163
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,742
Because at the end of the day,

164
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:16,511
these things need to be built.

165
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,746
They don't just appear,
there's no magic potion,

166
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:22,752
there's no shortcuts, but
they have to be built.

167
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,454
Because you're only going
to get out what you put in.

168
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:28,590
I mean this is why
we work hard right?

169
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:31,095
This is why we burn and bleed.

170
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:36,398
To achieve greatness, it's
like we have to take this

171
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,404
rough hewn piece of steel
and we gotta pound it,

172
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,540
until we get Excalibur.

173
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,642
You know that story right?

174
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:51,079
The story of King
Arthur and the sword.

175
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:54,818
Well, here's a little
history lesson for you.

176
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:59,556
Because history my
friends is so important.

177
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:06,061
Because when you look at the
history books from school

178
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,829
or google or wherever the hell

179
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:10,898
you get your history
from nowadays,

180
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,072
what's the thing that you
see and remember the most?

181
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:20,644
Heroes.

182
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:24,179
Hm?

183
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:28,016
Because last time I checked,
there isn't any room

184
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,917
in the history books
for losers now is there?

185
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,752
No sir.

186
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,588
No.

187
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:36,324
Championships, banners,
trophies, all of that,

188
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:39,361
that was determined by
people who were writing

189
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:40,864
their own history.

190
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,936
This is the place
where it happens.

191
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,406
Not amongst the glamor
or the spotlights

192
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:53,241
or how many likes
on your phones,

193
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:55,245
no, no, no none of that.

194
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:59,683
Because it's here in this place

195
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:03,587
where we build our own legacy.

196
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,958
This is where it all comes from.

197
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:17,201
That's it move him move him.

198
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:21,969
That's the way, work
for it work for it!

199
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,808
Who wants it more,
that's it good.

200
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:28,445
Move him out there.

201
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:34,349
Easy easy, that's it,
it's okay it's okay.

202
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:36,251
Good amount of aggression there,

203
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,986
that's exactly what we need
when we're in the corners.

204
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,456
Not get in a fight, whoever
wants it most gets it.

205
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,626
Beautiful, go.

206
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:47,262
That's what I want
to see from you man,

207
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,897
show me that, show
me lots of that.

208
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:50,700
Next two.

209
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:29,399
The nose?

210
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,499
No let me see it.

211
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,502
Very cute.

212
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:35,637
Fucking right I'm cute boys.

213
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,906
Man you're such a dumbass.

214
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:40,242
Dude I look like I could
beat the shit out of everyone.

215
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:43,911
Oh yeah?

216
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,847
That's coming from the big
boy that believes in ghosts.

217
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,882
Oh yeah, ghost
whisperer over here.

218
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:50,585
Alright fuck you guys
cause that shit's real.

219
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:52,053
So laugh all you want.

220
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:53,455
What are you talking about?

221
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,889
The hotel in Cranbrook,
he thought he saw.

222
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,129
Alright, fuck you guys.

223
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,798
Next time I'm going
to befriend the ghost

224
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,733
and I'm gonna have him
haunt every last one of you.

225
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,068
Then we'll see who's laughing.

226
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,440
- I got like candles out,
- Yep me and my ghost friend.

227
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:13,875
Grams and Gramps,
back from the dead.

228
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:16,143
They got walkers
and dentures and shit.

229
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,314
Howling after us
biting us or something.

230
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,915
Just use your movie method,

231
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:23,084
you know when you close
your eyes, plug your ears,

232
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:25,453
and just know that
everything's gonna be okay.

233
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:27,221
It's gonna be alright.

234
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:28,290
I thought that was your
method with the ladies.

235
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:37,701
It's true, it's true.

236
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,343
Yo Cody buddy, hey Cody.

237
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:52,847
Yeah, what's up?

238
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,582
Do you know how to do this?

239
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:56,353
Uh maybe let's see.

240
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:10,534
It's damn near impossible.

241
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:14,001
Fuck man I don't know.

242
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:14,902
See.

243
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:17,038
How do you do yours?

244
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,710
Oh I just I got one
of those clip on ones.

245
00:24:24,648 --> 00:24:25,813
This is ridiculous.

246
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:27,584
Struggling?

247
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:29,853
Hey.

248
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,424
Do you want it any longer?

249
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,659
I think that works.

250
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:12,496
Good.

251
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:14,228
Thank you.

252
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,399
My pleasure.

253
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:21,738
You guys will have
to shine your own shoes though.

254
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:25,942
Come on!

255
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:31,881
Guys you're going on the open
ice, that's not how you do it!

256
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:37,020
Come on Kellan!

257
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:39,523
Same.

258
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,490
Brutal.

259
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:43,593
Unbelievable.

260
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:45,294
Come on!

261
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:50,632
Let's go, bring it up the
boards, up the boards,

262
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:53,334
I'm not gonna say it again!

263
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:55,336
Screaming my god
damn head off here.

264
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:57,805
That's it, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

265
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:01,308
Is everyone on fucking vacation!

266
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,748
What the fuck is wrong
with you guys huh!

267
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:08,015
Can somebody please tell me

268
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:09,984
what the fuck is going
on out there, huh?

269
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,819
One of you guys come on.

270
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:16,190
Cause I have no fucking
idea what's going on!

271
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,128
Can one of you
enlighten me please?

272
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,830
You are fucking embarrassing
yourselves tonight.

273
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,699
You're embarrassing me,
and you're embarrassing

274
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:28,872
every single fucking fan
that's out there, watching you.

275
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:32,474
For some fucking reason
you guys have decided

276
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:36,377
to stay out of the corner
and off the fucking boards.

277
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:38,580
And on top of that
they're taking liberties

278
00:26:38,582 --> 00:26:40,347
with our top guys and what
the fuck you guys doing?

279
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,184
Nothing!

280
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:45,655
They are in our
house for fucks sake.

281
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:49,090
Our fucking house
for fucks sake!

282
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:51,893
Protect the fucking house!

283
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,629
Will somebody wake the fuck up?

284
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,363
Let's go warriors!

285
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,867
Let's go warriors.

286
00:27:50,854 --> 00:27:52,219
Break it up,
break it up boys!

287
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:53,056
Let go.

288
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:56,593
We're done.

289
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,365
You're done.

290
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:05,533
How am I done?

291
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:06,834
You're done,
hitting from behind.

292
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:08,069
They're jumping on me.

293
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:11,775
Let's go, you're done,
you want another game?

294
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,509
To the dressing room let's go.

295
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,779
Wait what about this guy?

296
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,281
To the dressing room.

297
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,883
Hey!

298
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:26,055
Dressing room or
you get another game, go.

299
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:49,877
What the fuck was that about?

300
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,078
Don't worry about it.

301
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,313
These guys are
fucking all over me,

302
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:53,380
I didn't know what the
fuck was happening.

303
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:54,882
I didn't know what was going on.

304
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:56,350
- I know, it's okay.
- I'm going back.

305
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,385
- Calm down.
- Move Coach get off me!

306
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:01,823
Calm down, take
it easy, stop it!

307
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:02,990
You're not going back out there

308
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,458
it's a bit of a cirus right now.

309
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,728
What the fuck man, these
guys are jumping all over me!

310
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,296
Take a breath, calm down.

311
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:11,198
- What happened?
- Shh.

312
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,834
What happened out
there to this kid?

313
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,568
I'm looking around he's
not getting up off the ice,

314
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,938
- what happened?
- They're loading him up.

315
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,405
Is he okay?

316
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:19,573
We don't know yet, he's
going to the hospital.

317
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:21,042
They'll check him out.

318
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,443
Just take it easy.

319
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,779
Let's go get changed.

320
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:26,681
Let's get you
changed up, come on.

321
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:27,516
Oh shit.

322
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,422
Get you a lift home.

323
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:10,426
Hey Coach, it's Tyson calling.

324
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,360
I just wanted to get you
on the phone and check in,

325
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:15,830
see what's going on.

326
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,766
I guess I'm gonna see you
guys this afternoon anyways,

327
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:22,937
but I never got a chance to
talk to anyone since last night.

328
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:25,875
Yeah, so I just
wanted to check in.

329
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:33,116
Just give me a shout back when
you can, please thank you.

330
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:26,830
Hey Tyson, come in here man.

331
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:31,498
I was just wandering
around downstairs there.

332
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,901
Didn't see anybody, but

333
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:36,670
I was trying to figure
out what's going on.

334
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:38,305
Haven't really had a chance
here to talk to anybody

335
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:40,107
since last night.

336
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:42,877
I know, we know, well things
have been pretty chaotic

337
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,946
around here as you can imagine.

338
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:46,513
Everybody's got
their mind on you.

339
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:50,351
It's been wacky the last
16 hours, let me tell you.

340
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:55,156
But, we have a number of
issues we have to weed through,

341
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:58,860
with the league,
and the media right.

342
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,729
Yeah I know for sure.

343
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:06,100
I'm just wondering what I
can do, what I should do.

344
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:08,269
Honestly probably the
best thing you could do

345
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:10,104
is just take it easy.

346
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:11,973
Go lay low, alright.

347
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:13,807
You don't need to be talking
to anybody about this.

348
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:15,877
Don't need to concern
yourself with any of this.

349
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:17,578
We got people to take
care of that, right?

350
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,414
Yep.

351
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,353
How is he?

352
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:30,059
He's in the hospital.

353
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:33,562
That's all we know.

354
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:43,072
Hey listen man, around here
we're worried about you alright.

355
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,411
Worried about making
sure you're good to go.

356
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,581
So just try to take it easy.

357
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,585
You alright?

358
00:33:58,587 --> 00:33:59,753
Yeah.

359
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:00,589
Yeah?

360
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:06,429
Yeah it's just a
little overwhelming.

361
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:13,600
Well uh, things are
getting pretty chaotic.

362
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:15,002
Gotta get back to business here.

363
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:16,603
Back to work, but uh.

364
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:18,505
Thanks for seeing me,
and taking the time.

365
00:34:18,507 --> 00:34:20,041
I appreciate it.

366
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:23,044
Oh yeah, like I said man,
just take it easy, alright?

367
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:24,880
And you'll be alright.

368
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,720
The game
came to a disturbing end

369
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:36,623
after a violent hit by
Prince's defenseman Tyson Burr

370
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:40,962
left Cheif's player Kyle
Ridlowe critically injured.

371
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:42,596
I don't
know exactly what

372
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,365
his condition is right now,

373
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,970
we have not heard specifically.

374
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:50,873
All I can say right now is that

375
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:55,642
all of our hearts and
prayers are with Kyle.

376
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:57,144
This
morning doctors said

377
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:58,579
that Ridlowe was
in stable condition

378
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:00,581
but the extent of his
injuries are severe.

379
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,883
The hit left him with
a broken vertebrae

380
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:05,086
as well as hemorrhaging
in his brain.

381
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:09,723
In a moment the young
man's life changed forever.

382
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:12,728
It's
disgusting, disgusting.

383
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:16,966
How is that a hockey play?

384
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:22,369
They're down in the
third, down by five.

385
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,439
Five nothing.

386
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:30,513
Nobody can tell me that
that's a hockey play.

387
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,719
You scared me.

388
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,323
Sorry about that.

389
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:04,547
I don't know what to do.

390
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:11,754
I feel like,

391
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:16,125
I don't know.

392
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:25,399
Just feel like I'm messed
up or something you know?

393
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,900
Like sick.

394
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:28,469
Well there's Tylenol and
all that in the kitchen.

395
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:32,241
Do you need something,
you can help yourself.

396
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:08,975
Have any need to
be inconvenienced at all.

397
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,046
Appreciate that.

398
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,850
Hey Tyson.

399
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:17,853
Hey coach.

400
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,121
Well it's
good to see you.

401
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:22,022
Yeah
likewise, I gotta run

402
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:24,225
but I'm sure we'll talk soon.

403
00:37:24,227 --> 00:37:25,192
Hey Bill take care.

404
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:26,660
See you soon.

405
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:30,366
Tyson, why don't
you come have a seat.

406
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:32,599
How you doing Tyson?

407
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:33,869
Good, thanks.

408
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:37,438
Tyson, this is Elliot
Carr, he's an attorney.

409
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,973
He does some specific
work for the organization

410
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,175
from time to time.

411
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:42,343
Pleased to meet you Tyson.

412
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:43,577
Nice to meet you.

413
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:44,845
Elliot's just here to
go over a few things.

414
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,183
Some technical detail stuff.

415
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:55,391
So the league is reviewing
this whole incident.

416
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:58,359
And we've been speaking
back and forth with them,

417
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,594
and well we've been
waiting to hear back

418
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:03,597
about any disciplinary action.

419
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,199
We've been looking
into our options

420
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:07,334
and we've decided to make
some organizational decisions

421
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:09,872
based on the current situation.

422
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,511
At this point, we're
suspending you indefinitely.

423
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:22,149
I know that's not what
you wanted to hear,

424
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:26,222
but you need to see this
as an act of good faith.

425
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:29,456
This is a chance for the
team to show the league

426
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,458
that we're willing to
take responsibility

427
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,396
for what happened here.

428
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:38,467
- Okay.
- Okay good.

429
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:41,402
Now this is all just
part of the process.

430
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:42,969
We just have to make
sure that everybody

431
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:45,308
comes out alright here okay?

432
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:49,410
Now to make this easier,

433
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:52,346
Elliot has drafted up
a statement for you

434
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:55,249
for the team to
release on your behalf.

435
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:59,520
Um, I can read it for
you now, if you like Tyson.

436
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:01,021
Please, yeah please.

437
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:02,989
We just want to
get it out there.

438
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:04,925
Be able to put it
out there right away.

439
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:05,928
Of course.

440
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,635
First and foremost, I
wish to extend my heartfelt

441
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:17,103
thoughts and sympathies
to Kyle Ridlowe

442
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,774
and his family, his
friends, and his teammates.

443
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,976
My prayers are with each
and every one of them

444
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,913
in this difficult time.

445
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:28,782
I'm profoundly sorry
for both the physical

446
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,151
and emotional hurt I have caused

447
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:35,389
and I cannot forgive myself
for inflicting these wounds,

448
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:38,459
but I can try my very best
to take full responsibility

449
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:39,695
for my actions.

450
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:44,197
I also wish to issue an
apology to my teammates,

451
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,371
my team, our fans and the
entire city of Prince George.

452
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:53,740
What happened on Friday night
was not at all reflective

453
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:58,445
of the values or culture of
the Prince George Warriors.

454
00:39:58,447 --> 00:40:00,847
And I am very sorry that
my individual actions

455
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:04,485
have cast such a dark
shadow over the organization

456
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,952
and this city.

457
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:10,457
I'm prepared to be fully
accountable for what I have done

458
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:12,793
and hope that
through this process

459
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:16,865
am able to repair some of
the damage I have cost.

460
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:19,566
Now this
is a chance for you

461
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:22,269
to get out in front
of this thing okay?

462
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:24,638
We can put this
out there for you,

463
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,775
and all you need to
do is step back okay?

464
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:30,243
You don't need to
talk to anyone,

465
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:32,646
or do anything alright?

466
00:40:32,648 --> 00:40:33,482
Alright.

467
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:37,984
I didn't mean for
that to happen.

468
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:40,787
Hey, we're
not here to judge

469
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:43,357
the way you play the game, okay?

470
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,492
We're just here to help.

471
00:40:45,494 --> 00:40:46,295
I know.

472
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,164
Thank you guys.

473
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,866
Guess I just feel bad you know?

474
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,169
I know you do.

475
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:58,173
And this, this
says you do, okay?

476
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:05,314
Yeah.

477
00:41:09,518 --> 00:41:11,420
How long is indefinite?

478
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,591
We'll have
to wait and see.

479
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:18,427
Okay.

480
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,297
Nice talking with
you Tyson, take care.

481
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:25,300
Thank you.

482
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:28,369
We'll
see you again soon.

483
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:29,705
You bet Coach.

484
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:05,832
Hey Bill.

485
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:06,635
Hey.

486
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:19,815
Listen,

487
00:43:22,585 --> 00:43:26,755
I've spoken with Wendy over
the last couple of days here,

488
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:34,697
after discussing things
we feel at this point

489
00:43:35,564 --> 00:43:36,897
it would be appropriate for you

490
00:43:36,899 --> 00:43:39,401
to find another place to stay.

491
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:49,878
I don't really
have anywhere to go.

492
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:55,048
Look, we're not trying to
complicate things here but,

493
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,485
this is our home.

494
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:01,156
I got priorities to our son.

495
00:44:02,558 --> 00:44:04,392
And with that in mind,

496
00:44:05,994 --> 00:44:09,898
I don't feel comfortable
having you around here.

497
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:13,936
Yeah, I understand that.

498
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:16,905
I uh,

499
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,244
I'll figure something
out, I will.

500
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,445
I'm not telling
you to pack your bags

501
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:29,883
right this minute and get out
on the street tonight but,

502
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:33,353
by tomorrow you need to
have your situation sorted.

503
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:34,523
That's fair.

504
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:43,331
Like I say, my
responsibility is to my family.

505
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,369
I don't want people coming
around knocking on my door

506
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:51,204
and I don't want to explain
what the commotion is

507
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:53,239
to my son, you know?

508
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:55,709
He's just a kid, he's
young, he's impressionable.

509
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:56,879
Yeah I know.

510
00:44:58,413 --> 00:45:03,083
He needs positive role
models around here and not,

511
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:05,253
this other stuff you know.

512
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:07,189
Yep.

513
00:45:11,994 --> 00:45:15,598
So I'm a fair
person you know but,

514
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:19,868
my family always
comes first, always.

515
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,206
Always you know.

516
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,442
Yeah, I know.

517
00:45:29,712 --> 00:45:30,979
I respect that.

518
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:44,324
Hey brother.

519
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,493
Hey brother.

520
00:45:54,937 --> 00:45:57,103
Alright, so that's you.

521
00:45:57,105 --> 00:45:59,472
Perfect man, thank again.

522
00:45:59,474 --> 00:46:01,541
That's alright.

523
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:04,144
So you just gonna
chill for a bit, or what

524
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:06,246
cause we gotta head to the
rink pretty quick here.

525
00:46:06,248 --> 00:46:09,752
Yeah I'll probably
step out or something.

526
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,654
Well if you want to shower
you know where it is right?

527
00:46:13,656 --> 00:46:16,089
Yeah I know, just back there.

528
00:46:16,091 --> 00:46:17,592
- Cool.
- Cool man.

529
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:22,462
Yeah I'm gonna get
going, talk to you later.

530
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:25,634
- See you later buddy.
- Yeah see you.

531
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,902
Take it easy okay?

532
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:31,239
Yeah man, have a good one.

533
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:08,394
Dude for real, she's the best.

534
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:12,134
Tron fucking broke.

535
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:17,303
Oh my god, Tronda's
fucking broke.

536
00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:19,705
Danger cat.

537
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,507
Is a danger cat.

538
00:49:25,848 --> 00:49:27,447
Get any
refills for you guys?

539
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:28,616
Good thanks.

540
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:35,188
And the second one
when they go to the screamer.

541
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,123
Yeah that's the one!

542
00:49:39,995 --> 00:49:42,528
As a kid I was up
there, I remember,

543
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:46,268
fucking knees shaking,
scared out of my mind.

544
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,170
After my grandma when,

545
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:53,006
it went straight all
the way up the sign.

546
00:49:53,008 --> 00:49:55,708
Granny.

547
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:59,481
It was so bad that I
puked, shit and puked.

548
00:50:03,051 --> 00:50:05,387
I know man I'm such a pussy.

549
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:12,692
There's your change.

550
00:50:12,694 --> 00:50:16,064
Thank you sweetie, oh
it's right this time.

551
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,674
I'd wash your hands first.

552
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:30,210
What's that buddy?

553
00:50:30,212 --> 00:50:31,644
I wasn't talking to you
disgraceful piece of shit.

554
00:50:31,646 --> 00:50:33,413
Hey fuck you!

555
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:34,881
Whoa, whoa!

556
00:50:34,883 --> 00:50:37,918
Fuck you!

557
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,087
Hey hey hey!

558
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:42,724
Get off my property!

559
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:01,207
Fuck you sack of shit.

560
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:02,110
Fuck you!

561
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,921
Burr, woo!

562
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,124
You know next time I'll let
you knock him out alright.

563
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:20,660
That's right baby, damn
that was a good one.

564
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:21,663
Fuck yeah!

565
00:52:18,786 --> 00:52:19,621
Hey man.

566
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:21,823
What's up man?

567
00:52:24,426 --> 00:52:25,360
Not much.

568
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:28,663
Where's Derek?

569
00:52:30,198 --> 00:52:31,866
He's already gone.

570
00:52:38,773 --> 00:52:40,873
Is that right.

571
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:41,709
Yeah,

572
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:46,981
coach wants to see us
both earlier today so.

573
00:52:51,053 --> 00:52:52,454
You gotta bounce.

574
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,260
Yeah man.

575
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:01,396
See you later.

576
00:53:03,398 --> 00:53:04,199
Yeah.

577
00:57:43,678 --> 00:57:44,746
- Hey.
- Hey.

578
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:54,547
So what's your plan?

579
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:56,050
He's gonna work.

580
00:58:57,385 --> 00:58:59,351
Yeah, I'm gonna go
see Hank tomorrow,

581
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:01,286
see if he's got
any shifts for me

582
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,388
over at the slaughter house.

583
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,823
Good.

584
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:05,525
I'll also get you working
on the old property.

585
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:08,060
Haven't any time to get to that.

586
00:59:08,062 --> 00:59:10,229
Gotta rip down that fence.

587
00:59:10,231 --> 00:59:12,632
Get all the wrecks
off the acreage

588
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:16,035
and finally tackle
that house, finally.

589
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:17,269
Yeah for sure.

590
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:18,540
I'll stay busy.

591
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:24,979
It's probably just going to
be for a little while anyway.

592
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:31,352
Well it's
nice you're home.

593
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:26,806
Hey Coach it's Tyson calling,

594
01:00:26,808 --> 01:00:29,842
I was just hoping to
have a chat with you

595
01:00:29,844 --> 01:00:32,478
when you get a moment.

596
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,048
I've been taking some time
to straighten myself out here

597
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,819
and yeah I'm really looking
forward to getting back

598
01:00:39,821 --> 01:00:43,623
and contributing and just
being a part of the team,

599
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:45,392
helping you guys out.

600
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:50,596
Yeah, just looking forward
to getting back out there.

601
01:00:50,598 --> 01:00:54,900
So if you could give me a shout
back when you get a chance

602
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:58,706
that would be really
great, alright thank you.

603
01:03:19,246 --> 01:03:22,349
Gotta clear
everything out of here.

604
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:28,087
May as well start
in the living room.

605
01:03:28,089 --> 01:03:29,924
Look at this, garbage.

606
01:03:36,097 --> 01:03:38,833
And the bathroom
I guess, stinks.

607
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:40,768
It's crap.

608
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:47,372
Keep anything of
value, metal, copper,

609
01:03:47,374 --> 01:03:49,110
toss it in the truck.

610
01:03:50,044 --> 01:03:50,878
Whatever.

611
01:03:55,282 --> 01:03:57,351
Whatever you can salvage.

612
01:04:00,822 --> 01:04:05,124
Thought of tackling this eyesore
just gives me a headache.

613
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:07,026
Anyway I'll talk to the
guy and see what day

614
01:04:07,028 --> 01:04:08,493
the can actually take her down.

615
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:09,962
Alright.

616
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:12,564
Just, do the best you can.

617
01:04:12,566 --> 01:04:13,400
Yep.

618
01:04:14,902 --> 01:04:15,737
Alright.

619
01:05:29,443 --> 01:05:31,676
At one point she had two kids

620
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,712
and I guess she was
jealous of me sleeping.

621
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:36,081
I didn't get much sleep,
I had to work the next day

622
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,783
for Popolson, and I was driving

623
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:40,452
from Prince George to
Smithers on a coastal run.

624
01:05:40,454 --> 01:05:41,753
Popolson's
a good company.

625
01:05:41,755 --> 01:05:43,588
I got a buddy work for them.

626
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,190
It's not too bad.

627
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:46,458
I'd say good good.

628
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,726
Yeah?

629
01:05:47,728 --> 01:05:50,429
I told Jack, he
decided to retire.

630
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:51,997
Oh okay.

631
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:54,166
Harold was in order
but Jack took off.

632
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:55,901
Right?

633
01:05:55,903 --> 01:06:00,039
So anyway I was driving
form Houston to Smithers

634
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,707
thinking I wasn't that tired,

635
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,543
ended up doing a little
bit of the blinks,

636
01:06:04,545 --> 01:06:06,011
going down the road.

637
01:06:06,013 --> 01:06:08,480
Whoa whoa, you gotta come out
and play hockey tonight man.

638
01:06:08,482 --> 01:06:10,349
Don't forget they
guys gotta see you.

639
01:06:10,351 --> 01:06:14,088
I know, Phil was saying
something about it.

640
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:16,055
Yeah, I might do that.

641
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,622
Yeah, new age hockey.

642
01:06:17,624 --> 01:06:19,058
Skates with a walker.

643
01:06:24,966 --> 01:06:26,832
I'll have my head up.

644
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:34,406
You'll like it, they're
a good bunch of guys man,

645
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:35,676
you'll like it.

646
01:07:51,418 --> 01:07:54,253
No I mean I went to
one game, it was a gift.

647
01:07:54,255 --> 01:07:56,421
I don't know, I'd
rather watch it on TV.

648
01:07:56,423 --> 01:07:59,994
I went to a Buffalo
Sabers game growing up,

649
01:08:01,228 --> 01:08:04,999
versus Toronto and then
I like being at home.

650
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:17,791
Hey, somebody come here!

651
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,526
I want to talk to somebody!

652
01:11:29,803 --> 01:11:30,637
Hey!

653
01:11:31,605 --> 01:11:34,706
I'm waiting here, come here!

654
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:44,485
Hey!

655
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:50,989
Hey!

656
01:11:50,991 --> 01:11:54,060
Somebody hey!

657
01:11:58,432 --> 01:12:00,732
I know you can hear me!

658
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,868
I know you can hear me!

659
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:07,908
Come here and talk to me!

660
01:12:49,483 --> 01:12:51,051
This is my house.

661
01:12:56,189 --> 01:12:57,591
This is our home.

662
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,960
We built this place,
and you need to show

663
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:04,498
some god damn respect for that.

664
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:14,105
You just don't seem
to get it do you?

665
01:13:14,107 --> 01:13:15,774
You have all these
people out there

666
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:19,411
bending over backwards
trying to help you.

667
01:13:19,413 --> 01:13:23,584
And you just keep shoveling
shit back in their faces.

668
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,088
Do you have any idea what we've
been though because of you?

669
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:31,425
Any idea at all?

670
01:13:33,694 --> 01:13:37,264
The embarrassment, the
fucking humiliation!

671
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:39,733
Do you?

672
01:13:41,568 --> 01:13:43,069
That's a question!

673
01:13:56,717 --> 01:13:58,151
You need to learn

674
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:02,856
to take some responsibility
for you actions.

675
01:14:04,425 --> 01:14:06,760
You're not a god damn child.

676
01:14:08,094 --> 01:14:09,963
Get your shit together.

677
01:15:24,538 --> 01:15:26,973
Please dial 374.

678
01:15:33,647 --> 01:15:36,415
You've
reached Coach Weller,

679
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:39,252
please leave a
message, thank you.

680
01:15:46,259 --> 01:15:49,227
Is the window for style
points here or what?

681
01:15:49,229 --> 01:15:52,330
No it was just an accident.

682
01:15:52,332 --> 01:15:54,265
I say you just chop
the roof altogether man

683
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:58,104
and rock a little
convertible action you know?

684
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,074
Oh I'm on a budget.

685
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,775
Tyson.

686
01:16:03,777 --> 01:16:04,609
Tyson, Eric.

687
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:05,844
Nice to meet you.

688
01:16:05,846 --> 01:16:09,313
What happened to
your hand there bud?

689
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,584
It's like um.

690
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,054
You know man don't
even worry about it.

691
01:16:16,056 --> 01:16:17,021
Shit happens you know.

692
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,157
Yeah shit happens.

693
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:20,158
So you
from around here?

694
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,260
Yep, I was away for awhile

695
01:16:22,262 --> 01:16:24,663
but now I'm back
for a little bit.

696
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:27,031
Well you picked the proper
spot for a vacation huh?

697
01:16:27,033 --> 01:16:27,868
Yeah.

698
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:30,068
See you back in there.

699
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,904
Alright.

700
01:17:03,336 --> 01:17:04,170
Ah, fuck!

701
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,874
Ah!

702
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:29,763
Oh fuck.

703
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,970
What's up man?

704
01:19:18,972 --> 01:19:19,806
Hey.

705
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:25,276
So you get that window fixed?

706
01:19:25,278 --> 01:19:26,911
Not yet, nope.

707
01:19:26,913 --> 01:19:30,014
Gonna take her in sometime soon.

708
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:32,150
Yeah I could have a
look at it if you like?

709
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:34,452
Do you do that kind of stuff?

710
01:19:34,454 --> 01:19:36,855
I dabble, a little bit of
this, a little bit of that.

711
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:37,691
Yeah.

712
01:19:41,762 --> 01:19:43,862
How'd you end up here?

713
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:48,833
I was working a rig about
150 clicks north of here,

714
01:19:48,835 --> 01:19:52,170
I was just sick and
tired of the rat race.

715
01:19:52,172 --> 01:19:54,107
Had big plans you know.

716
01:19:55,341 --> 01:19:56,841
Shacked up with the old lady,

717
01:19:56,843 --> 01:19:59,010
I wanted to take that extra
step and get a house going

718
01:19:59,012 --> 01:20:02,647
and maybe get a couple little
young ones running around.

719
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:03,982
Nine months in she
went and started

720
01:20:03,984 --> 01:20:07,018
a whole new life without me so.

721
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,919
Shit man.

722
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:10,288
Kind of shook up.

723
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,589
Sucks.

724
01:20:11,591 --> 01:20:13,593
What are you gonna do?

725
01:20:14,627 --> 01:20:16,160
At least I got out of there,

726
01:20:16,162 --> 01:20:18,562
it was such a dark place,
you need to stay focused,

727
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,699
stay positive you know?

728
01:20:20,701 --> 01:20:23,735
Take the good with
the bad you know?

729
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:24,570
Yep.

730
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,013
Should probably get
back to work huh?

731
01:20:35,015 --> 01:20:38,018
Yeah you should
get back in there.

732
01:21:29,235 --> 01:21:30,070
Hey!

733
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,995
Yeah it totally
seems doable man.

734
01:23:36,997 --> 01:23:38,462
I mean I've never done
anything like this before,

735
01:23:38,464 --> 01:23:40,364
but doesn't seem impossible.

736
01:23:40,366 --> 01:23:41,599
That'd be wicked man.

737
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,167
How much would you
charge for that?

738
01:23:43,169 --> 01:23:44,635
I don't know like a
hundred bones maybe,

739
01:23:44,637 --> 01:23:47,705
you wouldn't have to cover
much after parts and stuff so.

740
01:23:47,707 --> 01:23:49,373
Definitely.

741
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,309
I could place an
order on Monday.

742
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:52,476
Yeah.

743
01:23:52,478 --> 01:23:53,677
I would probably
take a couple of weeks.

744
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,914
Rolling with the Saran
wrap until then so.

745
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:02,120
Cool man, well you
wanna come in for a beer?

746
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:04,224
Yeah, I could have one.

747
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:24,175
So you found the bathroom
alright in my mansion?

748
01:24:24,177 --> 01:24:27,145
You should see the fucking
place I'm working on.

749
01:24:27,147 --> 01:24:29,981
What you got a little
rental job on the go?

750
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:33,084
Yeah, it's basically
like this scrap job

751
01:24:33,086 --> 01:24:34,818
on one of our properties.

752
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,821
Just trying to pull whatever
we can out of there you know.

753
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,891
Collect from the floors, walls.

754
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:43,327
Most of it's rusted to shit.

755
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:47,065
Woods all finished but
there's a few things.

756
01:24:47,067 --> 01:24:50,201
And after that we're just gonna
knock it down for pasture.

757
01:24:50,203 --> 01:24:51,502
Total salvage mission eh?

758
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:52,338
Mm hmm.

759
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:57,208
Nice, has it been in
your family for years?

760
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,479
Yeah, it's my Godparents.

761
01:25:00,646 --> 01:25:05,349
But no one's lived there
after my Grandpa died.

762
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:07,453
It's been empty for ages.

763
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:12,190
You grew up there as a tyke?

764
01:25:12,192 --> 01:25:15,793
I spend a lot of time
there when I was younger.

765
01:25:15,795 --> 01:25:19,530
But it's like early
memories you know?

766
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:22,300
Never really met my Grandma.

767
01:25:22,302 --> 01:25:25,569
My Grandpa died when
I was really young.

768
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:29,575
And him and my Dad had
this weird kind of thing.

769
01:25:31,177 --> 01:25:34,945
It was kind of old school
military guy right.

770
01:25:34,947 --> 01:25:37,850
So they had their
problems I guess.

771
01:25:40,153 --> 01:25:43,921
So after he died we didn't
really hang out there too much.

772
01:25:43,923 --> 01:25:46,657
It's like a place that's
always been left alone.

773
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:48,526
Out of sight our of
mind kind of thing.

774
01:25:48,528 --> 01:25:49,362
Mm hmm.

775
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,631
So how'd you grandpa pass?

776
01:25:53,633 --> 01:25:55,566
Throat cancer.

777
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:57,068
Throat cancer eh?

778
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:58,571
Yep, rough shit.

779
01:25:59,772 --> 01:26:00,606
Yeah.

780
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,975
I can totally relate.

781
01:26:04,977 --> 01:26:09,082
I was in the hospital and I
had this young guy beside me

782
01:26:10,516 --> 01:26:14,952
that had a trach, and his
breathing would be fine

783
01:26:14,954 --> 01:26:16,987
and then about a half an
hour into it you could hear a

784
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:20,291
you know it was the flem
buildup so they would come in

785
01:26:20,293 --> 01:26:22,860
with a tube and
stick it in his trach

786
01:26:22,862 --> 01:26:24,764
suck out all this flem.

787
01:26:26,332 --> 01:26:27,631
Yeah.

788
01:26:27,633 --> 01:26:31,035
And meanwhile I'm just
like, shut the fuck up!

789
01:26:31,037 --> 01:26:34,638
I'm trying to sleep, go die
somewhere else you know.

790
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:38,078
Just being totally
delirious of the fact.

791
01:26:39,579 --> 01:26:43,214
And two days in, the next
night, following night,

792
01:26:43,216 --> 01:26:44,882
wake up in the morning
and I'm usually woken up

793
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:47,518
by this suction of
this tube and whatever

794
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,688
and I look over and
the bed was gone.

795
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:53,091
I ask the nurse
and I yell nurse,

796
01:26:53,093 --> 01:26:56,627
what happened to the
little kipper her.

797
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:58,429
And the nurse it like
yeah, didn't make it,

798
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:00,698
you know and whatever,
throat cancer got him.

799
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,233
And I was just like, what?

800
01:27:02,235 --> 01:27:05,436
I'm being me being six years
old, I'm like holy fuck man,

801
01:27:05,438 --> 01:27:07,004
that's heavy.

802
01:27:07,006 --> 01:27:09,842
Dying, he just died
right there man

803
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:14,378
What you end up in there for?

804
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:17,881
I actually like, I was
in a coma for two months.

805
01:27:17,883 --> 01:27:19,217
No way.

806
01:27:19,219 --> 01:27:22,220
Yeah dude, I
survived the coma,

807
01:27:22,222 --> 01:27:24,888
and yeah it was pretty heavy.

808
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:29,059
My mom organized this
parade in Fort Mac

809
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:32,062
when I was living up
there and the theme was

810
01:27:32,064 --> 01:27:33,999
cowboys versus indians.

811
01:27:35,435 --> 01:27:37,435
Well of course me being
an indian I came prepared

812
01:27:37,437 --> 01:27:41,739
with my bustles you
know, my pow wow regalia,

813
01:27:41,741 --> 01:27:44,477
my gear you know,
totally jiving.

814
01:27:46,179 --> 01:27:49,046
And then all of a
sudden, it stops.

815
01:27:49,048 --> 01:27:50,414
And we're like
what's the hold up

816
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:51,815
and we look over there.

817
01:27:51,817 --> 01:27:54,852
Here like someone was,
there was some holdup.

818
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:57,988
So I just kick back,
waving at the same people

819
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:00,124
doing whatever, and
then it violently shook

820
01:28:00,126 --> 01:28:02,593
and I went flying eight
feet off this platform.

821
01:28:02,595 --> 01:28:06,766
Right onto my head, like
smacked my dome and everything.

822
01:28:08,734 --> 01:28:12,736
The driver behind us in the,
passed like the following,

823
01:28:12,738 --> 01:28:14,338
18 wheeler didn't even see me

824
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,540
and it straight just
ran my leg over,

825
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:17,941
crushed it in seven place.

826
01:28:17,943 --> 01:28:18,876
Oh fuck.

827
01:28:18,878 --> 01:28:20,244
I was unconscious you know.

828
01:28:20,246 --> 01:28:21,181
God damn.

829
01:28:22,348 --> 01:28:24,582
Gretzky came and saw
me in the hospital,

830
01:28:24,584 --> 01:28:27,585
you know, Gretzky
straight up showed up.

831
01:28:27,587 --> 01:28:28,486
The great one.

832
01:28:29,489 --> 01:28:30,988
I'm all tubed up like totally,

833
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:33,557
like sheets across they way,
full of tubes and everything.

834
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:36,427
There's Gretzky puts
down a home jersey

835
01:28:36,429 --> 01:28:39,163
and an away jersey and
that's the photo I have.

836
01:28:39,165 --> 01:28:43,667
Smiling for the camera while
he's autographing these jerseys

837
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:45,403
and I'm fucking, I got
a little teddy bear

838
01:28:45,405 --> 01:28:48,639
stuffed under my arm, I'm
fucking out of it you know?

839
01:28:50,109 --> 01:28:53,711
I'm gonna go grab
another beer alright.

840
01:29:11,297 --> 01:29:12,965
I'm fucked up man.

841
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:16,802
I'm just fucked up man.

842
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,540
You alright there buddy?

843
01:29:22,542 --> 01:29:24,644
Yeah, I just fucked up.

844
01:29:26,712 --> 01:29:28,714
You'll be alright man.

845
01:29:31,451 --> 01:29:34,151
Just fucked up you know.

846
01:29:34,153 --> 01:29:38,224
I was just drinking too
much, fucked up you know.

847
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,262
You'll be fine bro.

848
01:29:43,263 --> 01:29:44,096
Yep.

849
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,101
No worries.

850
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,738
Everything's gonna be fine man.

851
01:29:55,275 --> 01:29:56,108
Yep.

852
01:31:17,857 --> 01:31:20,157
Do you need
a ride on Thursday?

853
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,828
No that's alright I can drive.

854
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:26,997
Do you want a ride?

855
01:31:26,999 --> 01:31:28,233
No thank you.

856
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:30,302
Okay.

857
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:46,757
How's everything
looking up at the house?

858
01:35:46,759 --> 01:35:49,526
I didn't have a chance
to get up there today

859
01:35:49,528 --> 01:35:51,428
but the house is looking good.

860
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:53,263
Things be, they'll take
it down on Wednesday.

861
01:35:53,265 --> 01:35:54,099
K.

862
01:35:54,967 --> 01:35:56,368
That sounds good.

863
01:36:15,721 --> 01:36:17,990
Thank you for that, work.

864
01:36:19,825 --> 01:36:21,491
Appreciate it.

865
01:36:21,493 --> 01:36:22,995
Yep, no problem.

866
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:27,330
If you need something
else just let me know.

867
01:36:27,332 --> 01:36:29,568
There's always something.

868
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:33,706
Yep.

869
01:39:03,122 --> 01:39:06,358
Yeah we're
all set back here.

870
01:40:21,867 --> 01:40:22,701
Come in.

871
01:40:24,369 --> 01:40:25,768
There she is.

872
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:26,970
Lovely to see you.

873
01:40:26,972 --> 01:40:28,438
Are you here to collect Alex?

874
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,772
If I can pry him away.

875
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:30,707
Good how are you.

876
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:33,310
Let me take this little guy.

877
01:40:33,312 --> 01:40:36,081
Let me get your
jacket for you.

878
01:40:37,349 --> 01:40:38,882
How you doing?

879
01:40:38,884 --> 01:40:40,886
Pretty good.

880
01:40:42,487 --> 01:40:43,954
Where you putting these?

881
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:45,488
Oh, I'll grab that.

882
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:47,157
Here can you take him for a sec.

883
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:47,993
Sure.

884
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:52,362
Well come on in,
have something to eat.

885
01:40:52,364 --> 01:40:56,001
Lots to drink in there
too, help yourself.

886
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:02,874
Careful man.

887
01:42:06,338 --> 01:42:08,371
Now I understand
there has already been

888
01:42:08,373 --> 01:42:10,640
a private settlement
reached between the parties

889
01:42:10,642 --> 01:42:12,942
representing Mr.
and Ms. Ridlowe,

890
01:42:12,944 --> 01:42:14,877
and the Prince George Warriors?

891
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:18,015
Yes,
that is correct sir.

892
01:42:18,017 --> 01:42:21,751
Alright, so that
leaves us with the matter

893
01:42:21,753 --> 01:42:25,522
of Mr. Burr, and the
liability of his part

894
01:42:25,524 --> 01:42:28,958
regarding his actions with
relation to the adverse impact

895
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,228
that those have had on
the respective parties

896
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:33,596
represented here today.

897
01:42:33,598 --> 01:42:35,298
I would like to
remind all parties

898
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,668
that this is simply a
preliminary hearing,

899
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:41,071
however you are welcome
to submit statements

900
01:42:41,073 --> 01:42:44,107
at this time should
you choose to.

901
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:47,844
Mr. Howard, I understand
that you would like to do so.

902
01:42:47,846 --> 01:42:50,547
Yes, your Honor.

903
01:42:50,549 --> 01:42:53,483
We feel that it is
imperative in this situation

904
01:42:53,485 --> 01:42:56,686
to recognize the responsibility
of the individual.

905
01:42:56,688 --> 01:42:58,655
And that the
individual's actions,

906
01:42:58,657 --> 01:43:02,159
taken on their own, were done
so without the direction,

907
01:43:02,161 --> 01:43:06,298
endorsement, or support of
the Prince George Warriors.

908
01:43:07,632 --> 01:43:09,866
We feel that this is
specifically vital in context

909
01:43:09,868 --> 01:43:12,469
of the character
of the individual.

910
01:43:12,471 --> 01:43:15,372
In this case we have
a young man who,

911
01:43:15,374 --> 01:43:17,774
since the incident on
which we are focused,

912
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,210
has been held in police custody.

913
01:43:20,212 --> 01:43:24,383
What this would seem to indicate
is a pattern of violence.

914
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:44,141
