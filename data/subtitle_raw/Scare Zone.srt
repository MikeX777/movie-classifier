1
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,140
- Fuckin' dickface!

2
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,980
- Sorry.

3
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,930
You ran into me.

4
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,110
-  Spider, he's all
yours.

5
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,360
- Lights!

6
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,150
Darryl, Darryl, Darryl.

7
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,150
It is Darryl right?

8
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,700
- That's ri-
- Don't Darryl!

9
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,410
Don't step in front of our
patrons, man.

10
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,820
They will run you down and
stampede

11
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,160
right over your ass, boy.

12
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
You don't know pain until
you've had for teeny-bitches

13
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,660

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,410
like a virgin on prom night!

15
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,290
It's simple bro, in and out.

16
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,630
Duck and jive ya know.

17
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,670
Boo then skidoo.

18
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,920
- Boo then skidoo.

19
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,470
Boo then skidoo.

20
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,630
- Bring your simple ass in here,
go.

21
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,430
Go, go, go!

22
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,390
You'll get it.

23
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,270
You better get it.

24
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,180
We open Friday!

25
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,770
Heh, heh, heh!

26
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,770
Hey now hold on,

27
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't want you getting all
stiff on me.

28
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,400
I don't want you dancing
like those zombies

29
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,650
in a Michael Jackson video, ya
know.

30
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,990
None of that, okay?

31
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,820
Come here.

32
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,780
All right you got to stay loose.

33
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,990
Move.

34
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,740
Ahhhh!

35
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,530
Fresh meat!

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,370
- Hey Spider, say hello to Bart,
Tracy,

37
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,580
Margo, um-

38
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,080
- Tyler.
- Tyler and Jake.

39
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,460
- Okay, thank you miss Summer
and this is-

40
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,710
- PJ, my fiancee.

41
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,210
He's going to help out.

42
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,130
Stop it.

43
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,470
- Yeah, good helper.

44
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,590
Uh, and this is Darryl who, like
you,

45
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,550
is new to the ways of fright!

46
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,140
- Hey Bart.
- Hey Darryl.

47
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,720
- We know each other from physi-

48
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,640

53
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,490
- Hey!

54
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,570
- Look.

55
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,110
You were scared, huh?

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,110
You pussy.

57
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,410
And now a tour of this year's
attraction:

58
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,870
"Scare Zone Three: The
Psycho-Splatter

59
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,540
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon".

60
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,410
- Yeah man!

61
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,410
- All right follow me, kiddies.

62
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,120
Ah, what you, no, no, no.

63
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,130
That's the gift shop.

64
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,960
Okay that's where we end.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,380
This is where we start.

66
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,510
Yeah, over here, yeah!

67
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,670
Okay, why don't you
just stick close to me.

68
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,720
- All right.
- All right?

69
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
You're lookin' like you rode in

70
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,840
on the short bus or somethin'.

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,640
Come on, guys.

72
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,100
- Excellent.

73
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,970
Pablo!

74
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,060
Donde esta

75
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,100
the remote control?

76
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,230
Fantastic.

77
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,060
All right, good,

78
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,650
let's see how we're doing.

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,690
- Bravo Mr. Peters.

80
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,530
- Ah-heh, that is fantastic.

81
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,540
- I'm sorry, what?

82
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,910
- Ah, no, it's very
good, it's very good eh?

83
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,000
- All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,370
- So I pulse them through in
like

85
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,420
six to eight at a time, no conga
line,

86
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,790
we want to separate
them into little clumps

87
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,790
that way you can get
them to shit themselves.

88
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,210
- Heh, that's right if they see

89
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,880
you coming there's no surprise.

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,760
- Boys and ghouls, meet the
owner

91
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,050
and creator, the Duke of
Dementia,

92
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,300
Scare Zone's own Sir Oliver
Peters!

93
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,100
- Yeah, just Oliver will be
fine.

94
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,850
- Hey man, good, I'm glad I ran
into you.

95
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,980
You know I've got that
appointment-

96
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,140
- Uh huh.

97
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,310
- And the newbies need to get
a tour from the man Oliver.

98
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,310
- All right.

99
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,150
Okay.

100
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,230
Go!

101
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,770
- All right, kids, scare ya
later.

102
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,570
Don't touch!

103
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,530
Don't touch.

104
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,360
Excuse me!

105
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,740
Excuse me, thank you, thank you.

106
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,950
- All right, let's go
over to the next scene.

107
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,320
There's more room in there.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
Voila!

109
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,200
Ha-ha!

110
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,000
Welcome my pretties on your

111
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,670
next stop on the scare zone
tour:

112
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,630
The Lair of the Slutty
Cannibal Vampiress Wench.

113
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,090
Now, this poor fellow here is

114
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,470
one of the vampiress's victims!

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,220
He came directly from the
Camden dungeon of tortures.

116
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,640
The first time Prince Harry saw

117
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,970
this gag he 'bout shit himself.

118
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,980
You.

119
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,190
- Margo.
- Perfect!

120
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,100
You could work this room, all
right?

121
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,440
You are a slutty blood sucking
vampire seeking victims.

122
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,690
Now, let me hear you hiss!

123
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,030
- Hiss?
- Yep.

124
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,610
- Uh, hisssss.

125
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,620
- Okay, uh, let me hear you, a,
shriek!

126
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,410
- Um, ahhhh.

127
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,870
- Well, she's got the slutty
part down.

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,670
- Shut up Trace!

129
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,500
- No, no, no, no, no.

130
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,380
It's not a problem.

131
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,500
Come forth.

132
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,420
- Um.
- C'mon.

133
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,380
This is what will work for you,

134
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,590
this is a shaker can.

135
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,470
Okay, you come out of
the shadows, all right?

136
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,050
And then, yee-ahhh!

137
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,890
It jars them pretty good.

138
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,640
- Cool!

139
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,810
Mind if I-
- Oh, yeah.

140
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,560
All right, all right, all right,

141
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,650
settle down, whoa!

142
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,520
Settle down, champ.

143
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
What's your name?

144
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,610
- Tyler.
- Of course it is.

145
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,690
I've got a job for you
and the skinny fellow

146
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,990
in a big scene down the hall.

147
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,110
Moving on!

148
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,950
- Hey Bart, Tyler's pretty

149
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,410
good with that shaker
can, lots of practice.

150
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,990
And you get to work with him!
- Oh, great.

151
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,700
Thanks, dick-weed.

152
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
- Okay here we come,

153
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,670
comin' in, comin in, comin' in,
comin' in.

154
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,880
Over there, over there, very
nice.

155
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,130
Now before the big scene, our
guests

156
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,220
must pass through the lye vat
dungeon.

157
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,140
- What's a lye vat?

158
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,970
- Yeah, lye was used in powder
form

159
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,810
for cleaning hides,
chemically burning away

160
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,520
the hair and the fat, yada,
yada, yada.

161
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,020
But it also came in handy
if you were a serial killer

162
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,730
trying to hide the stench of
your victims.

163
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,440
- Gross.
- And you are?

164
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,570
- Uh, Jake Jacobs.

165
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,400
- Spectacular.

166
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,530
Come over here.

167
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,400
Now you will be in this part
of the slaughter dungeon

168
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,320
wielding your bloody ax.

169
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,070
You'll be dressed in a mask and
jump suit

170
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,200
like your friend there.

171
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,370
- Okay, ohh.

172
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,370
Heavier than I thought.
- Yeah, that's

173
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,710
because it's real.

174
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

175
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,670
Do you know how much a good
quality

176
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,540
fake plastic ax costs?

177
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,540
Damn right it's real!

178
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,880
It's cheaper and it lasts
longer.

179
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,050
The blade is not the
sharpest thing in the world,

180
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,840
but it could hurt like hell
if you chop somebody with it.

181
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,140
So, you hold it like this, and
threaten!

182
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,100
All right?

183
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,190
Now don't, let anybody grab it
from you.

184
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,570
- Okay.

185
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,820
- Good, okay, moving on.

186
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Chop chop!

187
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,900
- Oh god it's real.
- Okay sexy man is crazy!

188
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,070
- This is sweet.

189
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,660
- I don't know.

190
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,870
I think this Oliver guy knows a
little

191
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,200
too much about hacking and
killing-

192
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,290
- Yeah, and he's got plans
for "the skinny fellow".

193
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,080
Chop chop!

194
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,340
- Ha-ha!

195
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,840
New for this year:

196
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,090
The Raw-topsy Zone where, as you

197
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,350
can see, a number of hellish
morticians

198
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,720
are watching a victim getting

199
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,640
sliced up on the autopsy table.

200
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,230
Now, sitting among the statues,

201
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,440
looking just like the
dummies will be Tyler and-

202
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,270
- Bart.

203
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,150
- Bingo!

204
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,780
You'll be frozen just like the
rest,

205
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,900
and then you leap up and
boo-yah!

206
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,160
You scream at unsuspecting
mazers.

207
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,160
Now, you don't want to blow
your voice out, all right?

208
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,240
So scream a couple of
times, and then other times

209
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,370
you can use this aluminum
bat to hit the railing.

210
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,330
Just don't hit anybody.

211
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,960
Remember, you scare fast then
pull back.

212
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,710
You don't want some macho
creep punching you out.

213
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,760
Dangerous.

214
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,920
- Somebody takes a swing
at me and he's going down!

215
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,470
- No, no, no Tyler.

216
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,470
We do not slug the paying
guests.

217
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,430
- Yeah, we're not supposed
to touch them at all, right?

218
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,310
- That's right.

219
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,010
No touchy.

220
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,890
Too much liability.

221
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,560
However we, the actors,

222
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,890
can interact physically with
each other.

223
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,480
- Tyler's all yours.
- For example, Summer

224
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,360
here will play a live
victim getting sliced up

225
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,530
by some mad doctor.

226
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,780
You see, he amputates her leg

227
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,320
while she's still squirming.

228
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,950
It's a good gag.

229
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,700
- Oh and I could be your doctor.

230
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,450
Oh!

231
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,870
Check this out!

232
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,330
- No, PJ.

233
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,160
No, Oliver.

234
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,370
I told you, I'm helping you

235
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,620
open this thing and then
we're going to Vegas

236
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,250
to get married like you
promised.

237
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,580
Right, honey?

238
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,710
- Uh-huh.

239
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,420
- Summer, could I talk to
you over here for a moment?

240
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,600
- Look, I know you want to

241
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,890
get the hell out of here
and start your new life

242
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,350
with prince charming-

243
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,770
- Awesome!

244
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,440
- Excellent choice by the way.

245
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,480
But I really need you here.

246
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,360
- No you don't.

247
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,570
You've got Claire, okay?

248
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,940
I need to get out of my parent's
house.

249
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,900
So we're getting married
this weekend as planned.

250
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,280
- Look, open for me this Friday.

251
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,910
If you can stay for Saturday and
Sunday

252
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,450
I will make the honeymoon really
special.

253
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,120
Come on you're the only
seasoned performer I've got.

254
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,210
- All right I'll open for you
Friday

255
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,540
and I'll talk to PJ about this
weekend.

256
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,670
- Fair enough.

257
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,630
Let's show the others
where they'll be stationed.

258
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,300
And we are walking-

259
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,180
- Oh, Tracy.
- Uh, I didn't do that-

260
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,310
Oh my God I'm gonna puke!

261
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,890
- What makes this smell?
- My own secret recipe.

262
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,060
- Why hello.
- Ugh that's bad.

263
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,150
Ah.

264
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,360
That is so cool.

265
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,780
- And we're walking.

266
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,700
Okay good, come on, everyone
through the body bag room.

267
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,490
I've turned the AC up in here to
turn this

268
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,200
sucker into a freezer.

269
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,120
Now, to the doll hall!

270
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,130
Isn't this fantastic!

271
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,930
All right, and who's left?

272
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,760
- Me.

273
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,550
Darryl.

274
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,300
- Bonanza!

275
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,010
You will be in this zone

276
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,640
which was last year's big hit.

277
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,350
It's entitled Dies and Dolls.

278
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,730
You'll be dressed just as you
are,

279
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,980
freaking people out with
your blood stained machete.

280
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,320
You know this still is my
favorite room.

281
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,280
Every child's nightmare lives in
the eyes

282
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,610
of these lifeless beings.

283
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,910
I've been collecting them for
years.

284
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,700
Years and years.

285
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,500
- Yahhhh!

286
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,460
You!

287
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,420
You are-

288
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,380
- Tracy!

289
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,260
- Superlative!

290
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,510
In this zone you will be a fresh

291
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,260
victim wearing a wedding
dress and veil working up

292
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,220
and down these stairs.

293
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,550
Yes, you are a recent victim.

294
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,390
Uh, you're turning vampire,
holding the bat-baby

295
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,890
that you just gave bloody birth
to

296
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,390
via the old monkey-wrench
cesarean.

297
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,440
- Oh my god.

298
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,900
Can't I just get like

299
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,690
a, shakey-up can?

300
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,570
- No.

301
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,190
No, you show people your mutated
newborn.

302
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,400
- Oh, oh.
- Sir Oliver!

303
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,820
It's ready!
- Ha-ha!

304
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,030
Now, we are in for a treat!

305
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,420
Ah, hello Jesus.

306
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,210
- No, no, no.

307
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,080
"Hey-Zu".

308
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,920
- Ex-scusi.

309
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,210
I'm sorry, what?

310
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,420
- It, it's ready.

311
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,260
It's ready!

312
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,090
- Ah ha-ha!

313
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,090
Buen provetcho!

314
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,430
And now welcome to the insanity

315
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,970
of the Psycho Strobelight Room!

316
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,940
Good!

317
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,820
As usual, I will be in the
finale area,

318
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,990
playing the pumpkin carver,

319
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,950
scaring people shitless with

320
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,830
Bloody Molly my trademarked

321
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,500
signature patent pending gas
powered

322
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,500
two cycle 20-inch chainsaw.

323
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,330
Now, this is where I
break one of my own rules,

324
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,540
and only I can do it.

325
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,630
Bart.

326
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,460
Come here.

327
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,100
You see?

328
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,100
I locked the chain on,
so no chain no pain.

329
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,770
Just a hell of a lot
of vibration and noise.

330
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,810
Grazie, Hymie.

331
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,400
Now, I wouldn't normally
touch anybody with it,

332
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,980
but if there's some complete ass

333
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,320
acting too cool in front of his
friends,

334
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,110
I might feel the need
to give him a gut check,

335
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,160
like ol' Bart there.

336
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,620
Now add to this the smoke
machines,

337
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,990
lots of light and sound effects,

338
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,370
the strobe room, the chainsaw
finale,

339
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,710
yada, yada, yada, we happily
freak out the customers

340
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,380
who happily scamper into the

341
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,040
gift shop to spend more money!

342
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,250
Jesus!

343
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,380
- No, no, no, "Hey-Zu".

344
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,260
- No, no, no.

345
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,010
Whatever.

346
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,010
What the hell was that?

347
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,470
De nada.

348
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,560
Okay, uh, right.

349
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,930
You go into the gift
shop and wait for Claire.

350
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,140
She'll give you your costumes

351
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,850
and talk makeup for
anybody who needs help.

352
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,400
Say that again but slower.

353
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,400
- Yeah I've been coming
here the past few years.

354
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,110
He's only open three
nights but at 10 bucks

355
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,150
a head he makes a killing.

356
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,110
- Oh, dude,

357
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,240
I heard he used to manage a
house

358
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,490
of horrors wax museum in London,

359
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,830
but he got busted for
using real blood or a real

360
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,120
corpse or something.

361
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,290
- No, no!

362
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,830
I heard he killed a goat live
just to watch people react.

363
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,000
- Bullshit.

364
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,290
- Yeah, no he got fired and
went to prison for, like,

365
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,130
animal cruelty or something.

366
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,130
- Oh no, no.

367
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,250
I heard he went to
prison because he killed

368
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,130
a boney, pasty virgin.

369
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,630
- Oh, shut up asswipe.

370
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,590
- Ooh, shopping!

371
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,180
Oh, I wonder if we get, like,
half-off.

372
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,910
- Who's the slut?

373
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,830
Perfect.

374
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,000
All right I designed this look
for you

375
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,960
with this make-up illustration
you can work from.

376
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,050
Your costume's over there, go
try it on

377
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,720
and I'll help you with the
makeup later.

378
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,550
The bride?

379
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,810
Bat-boy's mother?

380
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,020
I didn't design the dress.

381
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
- Thank God.

382
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,020
- Bought it at a consignment
shop, but it works.

383
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,690
And your makeup needs to be more
defined.

384
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,440
Okay, we need to be able
to see it behind the veil.

385
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,570
Why don't you slip that on, try
it out.

386
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,650
- Great.

387
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,360
- Dummies?
- Yo!

388
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,950
- I mean morticians.

389
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,580
You guys need to look just
like the mortician dummi-

392
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,880
- Sorry.
- Costumes are over there,

393
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,510
and I made boy-friendly
makeup directions for you.

394
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,840
- Yes!

395
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,970
- Makeup is with your costumes

396
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,260
and we don't have a lot of room
in here

397
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,640
so we put on our makeup here in
the shop.

398
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,930
We rigged up a curtained
off changing area,

399
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,520
it has one bench and one mirror-

400
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,850
- Whoa!
- That's for the girls.

401
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,820
Boys just use the shop mirror.

402
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Masked psychos?

403
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,910
I see you have your costume
already.

404
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,030
Fit okay?

405
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,660
- Yeah.

406
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,910
Great.

407
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,660
- And your mask, it's up there.

408
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,210
There's lots of welder's gloves
and a mechanic jump suit,

409
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,880
just pick ones that fit.

410
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,840
Summer?

411
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,630
I have your hospital
gown and doctor scrubs

412
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,010
for PJ if Oliver can talk you
two into-

413
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,050
- Claire, I don't know.

414
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,010
Okay, we're leaving town to get
married.

415
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,970
- Need a dress?

416
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,570

434
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,540
what part do you play?

435
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,000
- Yeah, 'cause I really like
your costume.

436
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,000
- Yeah.
- No.

437
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,210
I stay here and work the gift
shop.

438
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,130
Spider gets their money going
in, I get 'em going out.

439
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,760
All right remember everybody,
today Spider

440
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,390
rehearses you, but tomorrow
night we open.

441
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,180
All right?

442
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,010
Any questions?

443
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,810
- Uh, yeah.

444
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,470
Uh, who breaks us?

445
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,430
- No breaks.

446
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,060
- What?
- Look.

447
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,230
We're open from seven p.m.

448
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,730
until the last guest goes
through.

449
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,190
All right, that's usually
'till, like midnight

450
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,150
on the first two nights
and two a.m. on Halloween.

451
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,230
- What if I have to pee?

452
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,190
- Then pee!

453
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,860
There's a toilet right there.

454
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,530
And that's for everybody.

455
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,410
- Okay, where do I smoke?

456
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,780
- Out the back door in the
alley.

457
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,200
Look, just duck out, do
whatever it is you need to do.

458
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,580
No one in the maze is going to
say

459
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,410
"Hey, there's supposed to
be a psycho killer here".

460
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,130
Well, except maybe some
of our regulars. You!

461
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,250
You were here last year, right?

462
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,880
- Uh, I only went though seven
times.

463
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,550
Not like some of those
no-lifes who go through

464
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,050
10 times a night if they can.

465
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,220
- Yeah, 'cause you have a life.

466
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,510
- Anyway, if you have to

467
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,890
take a break just get back to
your post quickly so people

468
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,760
get their money's worth.

469
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,970
It's only three nights.

470
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,180
You'll survive.

471
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,390
And if we do good business,

472
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,600
Oliver takes care of us with
nice bonuses.

473
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,270
That's why I'm here.

474
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,480
- I'm gonna need some help!

475
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,940
- All right.

476
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,780
Uh, boys, go see what Oliver
needs.

477
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,030
And then everybody report to
Spider

478
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,780
after lunch for rehearsals.

479
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,910
Tyler!
- Yeah!

480
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,200
- Every evening one person
has to come in an hour

481
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,580
early to help Spider and Oliver

482
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,910
prep the house for our guests.

483
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,460
And you're up first.

484
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,330
So, tomorrow at six.

485
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,170
- I'll be here at five!
- Whatever.

486
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,630
- High as you can there, Pablo.

487
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,720
- Didn't this used to
be like, a Dollar Store?

488
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,470
- No, it was a porno shop.

489
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,680
- No way!
- Yeah!

490
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,600
Douche!

491
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,930
- You know actually this entire
attraction

492
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,100
can fit into two pod containers.

493
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,850
Yeah!

494
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,810
It takes me, Spider and half

495
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,980
a dozen man-power guys.

496
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,310
We can put the whole thing
up in a couple of days.

497
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,030
Actually, Pablo, can you
get your men together?

498
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,320
Uh, todos juntos?

499
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,240
- Ah, si si.

500
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,660
- Bellissimo.

501
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,280
I'll tell ya, the biggest pain
in the ass

502
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,200
is getting this sign up so hola
muchachos.

503
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,170
Un, dos, trio!

504
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,630
- "Prepare to be scared.

505
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,470
Scare Zone Three this weekend!"

506
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,880
Who comes up with this?

507
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
- Oliver does.

508
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,090
Keeps all this stuff in storage,

509
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,180
pulls it out once a
year and does his thing.

510
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,350
- Hey, how do you think he makes

511
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,180
that toilet scene smell so bad?

512
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,730
- Ah he shits in the pots and
waits

513
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,730
for the mold to grow.

514
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,850
- No way!

515
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,810
- Ha!

516
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,150
Jeez Bart, I don't know,
maybe he uses old socks

517
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,190
or fertilizer or something.

518
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,030
What do you think about Claire?

519
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,780
- Freak.

520
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,860
Goth gone wild.

521
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,990
- I don't know, man,
awful smart to be a freak.

522
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,200
Talented too.

523
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
- Freak.

524
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,410
"The Psycho-splatter
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon."

525
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,160
- Shit mother!

526
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,970
- Damn!

527
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,390
Maybe I shouldn't have come so
early.

528
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,570
Hey!

529
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm here to-

530
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,650
- What?

531
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,240
- Uh, I think they're ready.

532
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,820
Can we open early?

533
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,570
- No.

534
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,320
Hell no man!

535
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,330
Tyler never showed.

536
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,370
Me and Oliver had to open

537
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,450
this whole damn place by
ourselves.

538
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,580
Shithead.

539
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,420
Hold on.

540
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,040
All right, you can go in now.

541
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:15,750
Go!

542
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,460
Go-go-go hurry up!

543
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,340
All right you pussy worms!

544
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,340
You ready to get freaked out?

545
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,590
Yeah!

546
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,050
- Are you ready for some blood
and guts?

547
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,010
Yeah!

548
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,390
- Then get ready for Scare Zone
Three:

549
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,060
The Psycho-splatter
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon!

550
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,690
Yeah!

551
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,270
- Opening in just 10 minutes!

552
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,780
- Yeah.

553
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,280
Hey, no masks in the maze.

554
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,280
You guys know that!

555
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,110
- Oh, no-no-no.

556
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,280
Sorry Spidey.

557
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,950
- Oh, hey freaky geeky.

558
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,830
How've you been, man?

559
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,450
Wow, you guys startin' to
multiply now.

560
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,950
It was just the two of you
comin'

561
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,000
in the last couple of years

562
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,210
over and over and over again.

563
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,250
I mean not that I mind.

564
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,540
I like that you guys have no
life.

565
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,710
Ha!

566
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,920
As is our tradition,

567
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,130

promotional Scare Zone

568
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,670
T-shirt contest officially

569
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,840

570
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,090
Yeah, baby!

571
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,230
- It's open!

572
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,730
- Thank you Miss Amber!

573
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,190
All right boys, you know the
score,

574
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,030
move inside to my podium and
wait there

575
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,990
until I give the signal we're
open and I snatch your money.

576
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,030
Ha!

577
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,910
Excuse me, excuse me
out of the way please.

578
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,210
Hey, man, Scare Zone 2, Dies &
Dolls, man.

579
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,080
I love loyalty.

580
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,590
That's good, that's good stuff.

581
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,550
- Yeah, hey, when's Oliver going
to offer

582
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,590
an unlimited admissions pass
for the regular customers.

583
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,550
- Heh-heh.

584
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,800
Why would he do that?

585
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,930
You guys are stupid enough
to pay 10 bucks every time.

586
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,680
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

587
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,600
Hi Claire!

588
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,890
- We're good to go.

589
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,350
- All right guys now remember no
masks,

590
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,690
no smoking, no cameras!

591
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,280
No checks, no credit cards.

592
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,440
Just cash, baby.

593
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,610
All right my fellow zonies!

594
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,900
Scare Zone Three is now open for
business!

595
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,370

596
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,460

Front door locked?

612
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,190
All right, that is it for the
night!

613
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,780
So we did pretty good for
the first night, right guys?

614
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,570
Everybody got their costumes
hung up?

615
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,490
Claire will pay everybody

616
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,620
and let everybody out.

617
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,870
Spider and I will close up the
attraction.

618
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,370
Thank you for a great first
night.

619
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,040
Claire, give everybody an extra
60 clams.

620
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,000
Spider!

621
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,130
Oliver!

622
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,590
- Bullshit.

623
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,590
This is why I'm leaving.

624
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,550
I hate this town.

625
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,630
This job is killing me.

626
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,010
I'm in desperate need of a spa
treatment.

627
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,510
- Hey, an extra 60 bucks isn't
ba-

628
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,510
- And before I get home to
my goddamn parents' house

629
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,560
where I'm living to try and
save money, horn dog over here

630
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,020
is going to want to hump me up
one side and down the other.

631
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,190
Of course I want him to so there
goes half

632
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,190
the money we just made on a
cheap hotel.

633
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,440
- We can do it in the car!

634
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,900
- We are so out of here
tomorrow, Peege.

635
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,700
- Um, tomorrow you're opening.

636
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,570
- What?

637
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,280
- Yeah, Spider has his
appointment,

638
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,410
Oliver's not in 'till seven,

639
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,490
you're the only one that knows
how

640
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,950
to run the smoke machines.

641
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,750
- Oh my God!

642
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,620
- Thanks, Summer!

643
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,330
-  "Thanks, Summer."

644
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,170
- What happened to
Amber the T-shirt pixie?

645
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,920
- Oh, she's waiting for you in
the car.

646
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,670
Bart!

647
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,590
I'm kidding.

648
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,880
Amber is only here for the
opening

649
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,090
and then she goes to
her regular "night" job!

650
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,260
- Ohhhhhh.
- Get it.

651
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,430
- Well, that just leaves
me, Tracy and Margo!

652
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,810
Hey you guys want to hit
Denny's?

653
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,720
- Sure.

654
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,770
- Uh, Darryl?

655
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,190
Can you stay a sec and help me
count cash?

656
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,150
Sure.

657
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,770
- Have fun with Edwina
Scissorhands.

658
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,870
- Is this a lot of money for day
one?

659
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
Oh.

660
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,000
You're pretty fast with that
calculator.

661
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,250
Did you learn that at school
or...

662
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,800
Classic.

663
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,050
- He's scared.
- That was awesome!

664
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,300
- That was better than last
year.

665
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,220
I'll never get tired of that
one.

666
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,440
- Hey, boner!
- Shut up!

667
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,110
Man, if I hear one more "boner"
line.

668
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,280
- I don't know if this is worth

669
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,240
an extra 40 bucks, man.

670
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,570
We could get killed out here.

671
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,950
Hey, I liked flagging
parked cars a lot better.

672
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,080
- What?

673
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,250
- I said I had an amazing night
counting money with Claire.

674
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,500
- Yeah, sure you did.

675
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,670
- Oh, we talked and laughed

676
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,380
and she told me about her
family.

677
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,170
- Yeah, who?

678
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,420
The Addams Family?

679
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,010
- Yeah!

680
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,760
Look, man.

681
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,390
She's a freak all right?

682
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,140
- All right, a freak that can
add.

683
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,930
Why are you focusing on her
when you know we can have

684
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,730
Margo's mangoes and Tracy's
tangerines!

685
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,560
- Ah man, fu, was that a beer
bottle?

686
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,770
- Shit mother!

687
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,780
- Will you just stop?

688
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,860
- What?

689
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,410
- Stop it!

690
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,170
Peege, can you hand me
another liter of fluid?

691
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,300
- You know, I'd much rather be
giving you my bodily fluids.

692
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,800
- That's sweet, honey,
but haven't you had enough

693
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,720
of me by now?

694
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,600
- Mmmm.

695
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,510
I'll could never get enough of
you.

696
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,560
You are my-

697
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,890
- Don't say it.

698
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,980
- You are my-

699
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,520
- Don't say it!

700
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,980
Big boy.

701
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,900
Come on.

702
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,730
To the table.

703
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,610
To the table!

704
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,400
Come on!

705
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,860
Take your shirt off, take your
shirt off!

706
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,200
Take it off!

707
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,370
No, stop.
- What?

708
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,040
- Stop, stop.

709
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,270
- There.

710
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,400
I got him.

711
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,490
- I have to finish opening.

712
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,950
- Ahhh, c'mon Summer!

713
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,080
- I have to turn on the
lights and the sound.

714
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,450
Get your shirt!

715
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,550
Where's the frickin' audio?

716
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,420
PJ!

717
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,720
Stop playing with the chainsaw!

718
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,760
PJ!

719
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,140
Knock it off!

720
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,150
PJ!

721
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,810
PJ?

722
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
What the fuck are...

723
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,160
PJ?

724
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
PJ!

725
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,020
Scare Zone!

726
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,020
Scare Zone!

727
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,850
Scare Zone!

728
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,690
Scare Zone!

729
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,520
Scare Zone!

730
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,360
Scare Zone!

731
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,230
Scare Zone!

732
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,630
Open!

733
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,470
Open!

734
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,510
Open!

735
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,680
- Will you shut up!

736
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,770
Oh shut up, calm down.

737
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,060
We're not even open for
another half an hour.

738
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,940
- Can't you open a little
earlier?

739
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Yeah!

740
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,900
- I'm a little busy in here!

741
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,650
Let me find something to
entertain you until we open.

742
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,950
- No!

743
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,740
No!

744
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,080
Help me!

745
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,500
Help me!

746
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,850
- That was awesome!

747
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,980
Do it again!

748
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,190
Do it again!

749
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,560
Do it again!

750
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,770
Do it again!

751
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,110
Do it again!

752
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,610
- Hey man, why do I have to do
this again?

753
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,400
It's PJ's turn!

754
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,530
- PJ's gone, all right?

755
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,610
You keep them happy.

756
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,860
I've got to finish opening the
place up.

757
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,370
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

758
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,660
- PJ's gone?

759
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,620
And Summer too?

760
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,660
- Yeah man gone and eloped!

761
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,450
Something.

762
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,580
I don't know.

763
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,000
Look, they opened the
place and apparently split.

764
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,330
Okay, good luck to 'em, good
riddance.

765
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,630
Go out there and keep
this crowd from rioting!

766
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,750
Go, be a man!

767
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,180
- I'm all by myself in here!

768
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,650
First no Tyler, now no Summer
and PJ!

769
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,230
- Relax my little mortician,

770
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,020
Oliver Peters has it all sorted.

771
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,610
At least for tonight.

772
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,280
Ta-ta-da-ta-ta-ta-taaaa!

773
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,240
Behold!

774
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,740
An international twist
to our tortuous tale!

775
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,140
♪♪ They just wanna dance all
night ♪♪

776
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:45,900
♪♪ Move your bodies to
the music, to the music ♪♪

777
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,150
Hey!

778
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,500
- Darryl!

779
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,330
You can come in now.

780
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,170
C'mon man go.

781
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,550
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

782
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,260
All right people, we're ready

783
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,050
for you if your ready for a boo!

784
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,390
As I was saying, no masks,

785
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,180
no smoking, no...

786
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,020
Hey, what are you three, what?

787
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,440
You three bong turds
trying to get us shut down?

788
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,940
- You got a problem with it,
"mon"?

789
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,610
- Oh, no baby.

790
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,860
I love the devil's lettuce.

791
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,900
I also like my job.

792
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,490
So, basically what I'm
trying to say here is

793
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,820
nobody gets in until these three

794
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,450
puff-puff mother-fuckers are out
of here!

795
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,330
Smoke on that!

796
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,080
- Hey, hey, shut the fuck up!

797
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,000
- Get out of here assholes!

798
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,540
- Kiss my ass, bitch!

799
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,170
- Who you callin' bitch, bitch?

800
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,500
- What are you looking
at you big Sasquatch?

801
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,880
- Bye-bye boys.

802
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,970
Toodles!

803
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,760
And now my pretties,

804
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,470
Scare Zone Three is open

805
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,140
for the second night of fright!

806
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,970
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

807
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,400
I love Halloween.

808
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,910
- Shit!

809
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,970
- Hey, I hate 20s!

810
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,020
- Okay, that's the real dummy
there.

811
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,180
This light is out.

812
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,350
That guy used to be a girl,
and this is a fake leg!

813
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,740
- Oh, what the hell happened to
this?

814
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,540
- Who want's a beer?

815
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,420
To the best "day two" in
the history of Scare Zone!

816
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,710
Cheers!

817
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,840
- We couldn't do any better
unless

818
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,420
we were actually killing people.

819
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,800
That would pack 'em in.

820
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,380
- It actually would, you know.

821
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,720
- Okay Claire.

822
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,310
You're gonna freak out these
kids.

823
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,770
Look, you guys did great
tonight.

824
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,690
The spirits of the dead are with
us.

825
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,480
- Whooooooo!

826
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,610
- I would like everybody

827
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,070
to take an extra 100
bones out of the till.

828
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,150
Okay, Spider, let's go and close
up.

829
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,400
Oh, I'm gonna need some extra
help

830
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,320
with a broken window and wall
facade.

831
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,490
I need two guys to hold it in

832
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,950
place while we nail gun it to
the wall.

833
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,200
It'll only take about 10
minutes.

834
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll throw in another 20 bucks.

835
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,120
- I'm in.
- There you go.

836
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,250
- No, uh, Oliver, you've been
great.

837
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,540
You don't have to pay us.

838
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,420
- Hey!

839
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,340
Shut your pie hole.

840
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,630
I could use the "dinero".

841
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,380
- Heh-heh.

842
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,380
Tonight I can afford it.

843
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,470
- He can afford it.
- Let's go.

844
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,510
- Let's go.
- Shut up.

845
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,340
- Shut up.
- Stop tryin' to be me!

846
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,300
- Tracy, you've got to
help me with my make-up,

847
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,600
last time I about took
out a whole eyelash.

848
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,140
- Okay, hang on a sec.

849
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,270
Okay.

850
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,310
Let's go!

851
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,940
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

852
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,150
- Senorita Claire, tell
Senor Oliver that we will not

853
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,610
be performing for this job
tomorrow.

854
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,700
He's too, como se dice?

855
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,160
- Cheap!
- Cheap.

856
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,000
- So, you need help again
counting?

857
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,960
Okay.

858
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,260
So it looks like Summer
and PJ really went for it.

859
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,800
Yep, took the plunge.

860
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,510
- They're dead.

861
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,520
- What?

862
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,600
- Dead.

863
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,310
Any relationship that is
purely physical is death.

864
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,150
They're just going to be a
statistic.

865
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,230
- Well I hear today that two out

866
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,240
of three divorces end in
marriage.

867
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,900
- Not that death is bad.

868
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,490
Death of a relationship, of the
spirit,

869
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,120
death of the body.

870
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,700
I saw a dead body once.

871
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,090
Have you ever seen a
real dead body, Darryl?

872
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,630
- Well, I saw my granddad's
ashes,

873
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,550
it was kind of dusty.
- I was 11.

874
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,890
I was riding my bike down Old
Camp Road

875
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,270
when I saw, up ahead, this dust
cloud.

876
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,060
As I came closer I saw that a
truck

877
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,030
had run off the road
and slammed into a tree.

878
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,200
That was okay.

879
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,360
Kind of cool.

880
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,620
But further away in the grass
is what was really great.

881
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,960
There was a boy, about my age.

882
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,380
Blonde like me.

883
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,210
He was lying in the grass.

884
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,180
Not moving, not breathing.

885
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,850
He must have been sitting
in the bed of the truck.

886
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,600
Who knows how high or how hard
he hit?

887
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,520
But now he was on his back, eyes
open,

888
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,110
looking at the sky.

889
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,900
Still.

890
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,030
At peace.

891
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,370
- Sorry.

892
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,450
- Why?

893
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,080
It was beautiful.

894
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,910
And I was there.

895
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,380
No one was around.

896
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,970
I reached out, touched his face.

897
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,260
Touched his lips.

898
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,060
Then a car came down the
road and stopped to help.

899
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,020
It ruined our moment.

900
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,440
That's the closest I've ever
come to really knowing a boy.

901
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,490
Claire, uh, we have
a, uh, we have a question.

902
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,780
- Oh my god there's this,

903
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,120
there's this phat Halloween
party that we want to go to.

904
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,370
We want to go, like, and we-

905
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,660
- And, look we just want
to leave in our costumes.

906
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,660
- So, we'll see you there, okay?

907
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,750
- Did you just invite her?

908
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,500
- Huh?

909
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,370
- Bye ladies of the night!

910
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,260
All right, well, I wish Summer
and PJ the best I guess.

911
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,100
- Darryl, you seem like a nice
guy.

912
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,020
Don't be like the rest of them.

913
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,150
Don't force yourself on them.

914
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:44,360
Don't, don't guilt and chide

915
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,070
and force yourself on...

916
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,660
Pretty little blonde.

917
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,660
Come here, pretty little blonde.

918
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,250
Bring your red lips over here.

919
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,630
Black lips.

920
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,670
Black hair.

921
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,710
I'm dead.

922
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,380
I'm not your plaything now, I'm
dead.

923
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,470
Dead!

924
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,930
- Okay, I'm officially creeped
out.

925
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,520
Maybe you should relax.

926
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,320
- Sometimes the haze is so
thick,

927
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,650
the only way I can remind
myself I'm still in this world

928
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,740
is with the pleasure of pain.

929
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:37,700
Makes me feel good when
I'm in control of my pain.

930
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,500
I like that.

931
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,170
I've never let anyone watch me
before,

932
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,510
but I like you Darryl.

933
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,110
I've been working on this one.

934
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,700
This is our secret.

935
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,130
Makes me feel good.

936
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,980
- Shit, what was that?

937
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,900
- You'd better go see.

938
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,490
- Holy shit!

939
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,070
Can we not perform a simple

940
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,540
task without this juvenile
Tom-fuckery!

941
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,910
- I don't know what
happened, it just shot back

942
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:01,870
or exploded or something.

943
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,000
I, I don't know.

944
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,750
- Hey man.

945
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,830
Put the mother fuckin',

946
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,210
Jake, put the motherfuckin' nail
gun down.

947
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,380
- Put it down!

948
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,500
Spider, I'm gonna need your
shirt.

949
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,630
- Oh, yeah.

950
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,130
- Darryl, unplug the compressor
before it blows again.

951
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,470
Damn!

952
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,260
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

953
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,100
And don't you touch the nail.

954
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,640
We're going to let the doctors
remove it.

955
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,390
C'mon.

956
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,350
Let's get him out of here.

957
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,730
- I still get my 20 bucks?

958
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,480
- Yeah, I'd rather pay that

959
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,900
than for the tetanus
shots you're gonna need.

960
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:35,200
- Ah, shit mother!
- C'mon you assholes!

961
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,850
- Suck my balls, Scare Zone.

962
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,890
- What are you doing, bro?

963
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,270
I told you she takes the
cash when she leaves, man.

964
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,940
- I know that, I was just
checking.

965
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,860
- You guys suck.

966
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,690
Let's tag this this shit-hole.

967
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:12,900
Yeehaw!

968
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,650
- Yeah, suck my balls!

969
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,530
Oh, no, no, no. Check this out.
- Whatcha got? Look at this.

970
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,410
- Hey, how 'bout this man?

971
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:36,720
- Oh shit.
- Oh my God.

972
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,690
Yeah!

973
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,400
- He's paying for this.

974
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,970
- What an ass.
- He so tagged you, man.

975
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,390
- Let's just go back this way.

976
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,140
Holy shit!

977
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,010
Look at this toilet over here!

978
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,930
It's so lifelike.

979
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,230
- "Lifelike?"

980
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,190
- Whichever asshole threw me
in here, is going to get, ahhh!

981
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,570
C'mon bro, this is not,

982
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,330
who's that?

983
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,540
- It's not real.

984
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,100
What have we got over here, man?

985
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,430
- No idea.

986
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,180
- Please, please, please!

987
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,110
- What's that dip-shit up to
now?

988
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,740
- Where the hell are we?

989
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,120
- Where's that prick at?

990
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,330
- Hey, we gotta get out of here.

991
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,250
This is bullshit.

992
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,210
- Just go check down that way.

993
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,880
- Fuck it.

994
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,670
I'm gone.

995
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,840
And I've got the car keys.

996
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,960
I don't give a rat's ass
about you piss heads.

997
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,260
- Douche bag.

998
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,970
Fuck man, where're you at?

999
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,060
Hey!

1000
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,440
Hey!

1001
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,770
C'mon man!

1002
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,320
Stop dickin' around!

1003
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,550
Bart, honey, can you
get that?

1004
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,430
- Sorry mom, I'm injured.

1005
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,980
- Yes can I, uh, help you?

1006
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,350
- Yes ma'am, I'm Darryl Myers

1007
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,360
from the Scare Zone attraction.

1008
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,110
Is Bart home?

1009
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,690
- Well hello "Darryl Myers",

1010
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,490
Yes Bart is home, you know
my poor boy he's just-

1011
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,780
- Excuse me.

1012
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,030
- Oh.

1013
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,410
Um, thank you for,

1014
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,330
uh, cleaning my pipes.

1015
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,960
Well, let me see what you have
there.

1016
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,170
Oh, how sweet.

1017
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,960
Well, let me just take these
from you

1018
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,000
and get them in some water.

1019
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:04,630
Can I get you anything to drink?

1020
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,100
Oh Bart!

1021
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,180
You have company!

1022
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,310
I thought I
was supposed to hang out

1023
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,810
with dad next weekend!

1024
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:13,850
- No, dear.

1025
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,890
It's your little friend
from the scary house.

1026
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,980
He came to see how you're doing.

1027
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,150
- I'm in too much pain!

1028
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,900
Tell 'em to go away.

1029
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,440
- Hello, Bart!

1030
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,150
Heh, nice set up you big
bullshit artist.

1031
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,660
- Close the door.

1032
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,240
- Nice sheets.
- Close the door!

1033
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,450
Don't screw it for me, man.

1034
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,540
It's the first time in five
years my mom's sucked up to me.

1035
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,750
- Looked like your mom was
suckin' up to the plumber.

1036
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,250
- Funny, fag!

1037
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,790
Yeah, check out this set-up.

1038
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,750
This is sweet!

1039
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,960
- Yeah, if you're seven.

1040
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,420
- I'm taking this for
as long a ride as I, oh!

1041
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,630
I love this part.

1042
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,640
Hey, hey, hey!

1043
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,230
- Sorry, Bart.

1044
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,560
You and your "man-gina" need to
get out

1045
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,280
of bed and help me with
today's marketing blitz.

1046
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,320
- "Marketing blitz?"

1047
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,450
What are you, an ad agency
executive?

1048
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,990
- I need this money and Oliver
needs everyone in tonight.

1049
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,370
- Excuse me.

1050
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,580
Fatally injured.

1051
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,700
- Fatal means dead,
genius, and you're lifting

1052
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,160
your arm just fine.

1053
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,000
C'mon, it's one more night.

1054
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,550
- I get it.

1055
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,710
You need me.

1056
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,050
You can't go on without me.

1057
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,470
I am Scare Zone.

1058
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,310
But I can't hand out fliers.

1059
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:35,390
Injured.

1060
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,390
- Fine.

1061
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,520
We're not actually "handing
out" flyers this time.

1062
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,980
- Hey ladies!

1063

Scare Zone!

1072
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,180
- You're terrible.

1073

Thanks!

1078
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,080
- Dude, they're so hot.
- They were hot.

1079
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,080
- I'm going to go meet them.

1080
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,250
- No, no, no.

1081
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,000
Dude.

1082
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,000
We gotta go.

1083
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,040
C'mon!

1084
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:57,760
Oliver?

1085
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:20,580
Jake!

1086
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,620
What the fuck, man!

1087
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,000
- The back door was open, man,
my bad.

1088
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,120
- What'cha doing here?

1089
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,830
- Oliver told me to come help
you set up.

1090
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,960
- Oh he tell you but he don't
tell me?

1091
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,840
Ain't this about a bitch.

1092
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,880
Look, I'm glad you're
here, I need your help.

1093
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,260
I've got an appointment
downtown.

1094
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,970
- Heh.

1095
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:33,930
An "appointment" right?

1096
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:34,800
Heh-heh.

1097
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,050
- Yes an appointment I've got to
meet

1098
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,300
my parole officer is that okay
with you?

1099
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,510
Can you focus?

1100
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,390
Focus!

1101
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:40,770
Look, first thing I need you to
do is

1102
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,850
take this and put it back
where I found it, okay?

1103
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,190
Now I've got to set up this damn
dummy

1104
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,100
because those Spanish
assholes didn't show up,

1105
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,020
so you go finish filling
up the fog machine,

1106
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,690
then go turn on the sound
system,

1107
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,780
but turn it to the knob with the

1108
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,860
little piece of tape on it, then
go

1109
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,940
turn on the strobe lights,

1110
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,320
oh and fill the bat baby up with
water

1111
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,820
and if you're looking
for something else to do,

1112
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,820
you can finish this
list, do everything on it

1113
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,660
then after your done, wait for
Oliver or Claire because uh,

1114
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,080
uh, I ain't givin' you my keys.

1115
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,870
Okay?

1116
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,750
Ya got that?

1117
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,870
- Got it.

1118
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,380
- Now, Oliver's going to be
pissy 'cause I'm not here.

1119
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,960
Don't let him take it out on
you, okay?

1120
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,750
- 10-4.

1121
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,920
- Yeah, "10-4" wonder bread.

1122
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,720
Just go turn on the lye vat.

1123
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,760
Go.

1124
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,680
Go-go-go-go-go.

1125
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,470
Go, go!

1126
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,550
Can you speed? Urgency, yes, go.

1127
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,440
Spanish people don't show up.

1128
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,610
Bitches are supposed to like
work.

1129
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,160
What kind of shit?

1130
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,930
Oh shit!

1131
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,060

So, how can I help you?

1139
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,960
- I'm looking for Claire, I'm
her brother.

1140
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
- Brother, huh?

1141
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,460
Funny, I don't see the family
resemblance.

1142
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:56,090
'Course I guess you don't
put on the black lipstick

1143
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,750
and the funny make-up
'till after midnight, huh?

1144
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,670
Sandy, have you seen Miss
Claire?

Hang on honey,

I'll be right down.

1147
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:06,050
- So, what's Claire's brother's
name?

1148
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,600
- Me?

1149
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,430
Oh.

1150
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,270
Darryl.

1151
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,640
- Oh, really, what a
coinky-dink.

1152
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,020
I've got an elf around here
named Darryl someplace.

1153
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,400
- I didn't know Claire had a
brother,

1154
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,940
she never mentioned a brother.

1155
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,650
But, she's not a big talker.

1156
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,860
You'll find her right
back there by gift wrap.

1157
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,280

- Oh, hey, what are you doing
here?

1162
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,460
- You told me to come he-

1163
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,790
- Shhhh!

1164
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,880
Oh, you have a note from mom!

1165
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,010
That is bad.

1166
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,090
Oh, I'm glad you came.

1167
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,300
Um, Sandy,

1168
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,260
Sandy.

1169
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,390
You know it looks like
our mom is really sick

1170
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:53,180
and I'm gonna to leave
early to, um, care for her.

1171
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:55,690
- You said your mother's dead,
dear.

1172
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,520
- Oh.

1173
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,230
Oh!

1174
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,440
No our, our mam is sick.

1175
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,030
That's what we call our
grandmother.

1176
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:02,860
- Yeah.

1177
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,650
"Mam".

1178
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,900
- I'm really sorry Mrs. Kane,

1179
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,860
I really have to leave right
now.

1180
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,910
You know, to get to, mam.

1181
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,330
- I understand, dear.

1182
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,000
So, I'll see you tomorrow
morning at 10.

1183
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,500
It's a big day!

1184
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,830
- Okay, I wouldn't miss it.

1185
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:17,710
- Mam.

1186
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:18,960
- The holiday shopping season
starts

1187
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,130
the day after Halloween now, you
know!

1188
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,420
Toodles!

1189
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,670
- Whoo-hoo!

1190
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,590
Oh, get me out of here!

1191
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,220
Ha.

1192
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,260
Ya think vampires and zombies
are scary?

1193
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,770
Those people are scary!

1194
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,640
- I thought you worked at a
funeral home.

1195
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,350
- Who told you that?

1196
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,440
- Nobody.

1197
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,360
- No I've worked for the
Kanes for, like, four years

1198
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,030
and they still creep me out.

1199
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:43,940
- I dunno.

1200
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,440
They seemed like, "Really nice
people".

1201
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,030
Thanks for
getting me out of there,

1202
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,530
I'm running out of
excuses to cut out early.

1203
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,370
You confused them good.

1204
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,700
- Hey, I'm just glad you called.

1205
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,290
Is your car in the shop?

1206
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:56,540
- I don't drive.

1207
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,170
- Well how do you get around?

1208
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,380
- I usually walk.

1209
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,590
- This place is, like, 20
blocks from the strip mall.

1210
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,130
- Or I'll bum a ride or
hitchhike.

1211
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,930
- Isn't that a little dangerous?

1212
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,760
- No.

1213
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,510
- Shit!

1214
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,470
Put that away!

1215
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,270
Can't you carry, like, a can of
mace

1216
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:16,850
or a taser or something?

1217
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,310
- Mace doesn't stop them,
it just blinds them.

1218
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,360
Tasers you gotta keep charged.

1219
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,730
It's not practical.

1220
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,980
- Good point.

1221
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,190
- Oliver keeps a taser
charged and ready to go

1222
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,360
underneath the cash
register at the gift shop,

1223
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:33,530
but I'll stick with sexy Sadie,
thank you.

1224
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,290
- She's named her gun.

1225
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:38,710
- Oh, turn here.

1226
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,830
Turn here!

1227
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,260
Stop here.

1228
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,640
- How did I know this was
going to end at a cemetery?

1229
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,230
Claire?

1230
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,910
This isn't funny.

1231
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,080
I knew it was you.

1232
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,080
I just wanted to see what
you looked like laughing.

1233
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,670
- Don't get used to it.

1234
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,130
Let me show you something.

1235
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,180
- God damn it.

1236
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,560
- Darryl, I'd like you to meet
someone.

1237
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,980
- Mary Elisabeth Landers.

1238
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:46,900
- Hey, hey!

1239
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,570
Buddy.

1240
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,610
What are you doin'?

1241
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,650
Do you know those kids over
there?

1242
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,780
Are you listening to me?

1243
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,950
- Your mother?

1244
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,110
- No.

1245
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,030
- Not your mother.

1246
00:59:55,070 --> 01:00:00,120
- No, my mother is, quite alive.

1247
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,620
- Hello, ass-wipe,

1248
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,420
I'm talkin' to you!

1249
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,840
- No, she's my aunt.

1250
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,470
My mother's sister.

1251
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,260
Nothing exotic killed her, just
cancer.

1252
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,270
But I wanted you to meet her.

1253
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,390
You remind me a lot of her.

1254
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,240
Hey Aunt Mare,

1255
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,910
I'd like you to meet Darryl.

1256
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,750
- Hello, Ms. Landers, how are
you?

1257
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,670
- She can't talk to
you Darryl, she's dead.

1258
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:53,510
- I know.

1259
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,520
- You know, she was the only
person

1260
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,150
that ever brought me a Christmas
present.

1261
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,190
Every year she would bring me
something

1262
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,480
and wrap it so beautifully.

1263
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:18,070
She pretty much raised me 'till
I was 10.

1264
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,790
My Aunt Mare kept me from harm.

1265
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,130
Then she died.

1266
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,560
One year she got me this snow
globe.

1267
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,190
It was one of those real glass
ones,

1268
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:54,400
not like the plastic
ones you see at the mall.

1269
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,860
It had this whole little village
in it.

1270
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,950
That became a great tool for my
mom.

1271
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:07,370
She could just raise it up
and threaten to smash it.

1272
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,380
She finally made good on that
threat.

1273
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,390
Darryl, I really appreciate you

1274
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,810
trying to strike up a
conversation
with me two nights ago.

1275
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:30,940
- Hey, I'm sorry you lost
somebody

1276
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,860
that you cared so much about.

1277
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,440
It seems like things went
all down hill after that.

1278
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,490
You seem to be fighting a lot of
demons.

1279
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,120
- I was just a cute little
blonde

1280
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,620
no one could keep their hands
off of.

1281
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,080
- And, as a friend, albeit a new
friend,

1282
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,380
I want to say something.

1283
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,250
Go ahead.

1284
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,050
- Be goth, carry guns
and hum strange tunes,

1285
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,470
but you shouldn't be hurting
yourself.

1286
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:06,350
You deserve better than that.

1287
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,560
Get a tattoo and let the
professional hurt you!

1288
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,360
- That could probably take some
therapy.

1289
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,690
- Think about it.

1290
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:23,320
Now, ready to go hack,

1291
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,330
maim, bludgeon and slaughter
ourselves

1292
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,200
to the delight of thousands?

1293
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,040
- Yippie!

1294
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,330
Ha-ha.

1295
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:31,500
Bye Aunt Mare.

1296
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,500
Happy Halloween.

1297
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,590
- So I suppose you like "How
the Grinch Stole Christmas"?

1298
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:41,510
- Love it!

1299
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:42,760
- And your favorite movie of all
time,

1300
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,930
the "Nightmare Before
Christmas"?

1301
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,350
- Now you're getting me hot!

1302
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:06,330
♪♪ Come on, do the twist ♪♪

1303
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:17,460
♪♪ Do the twist... the
Frankenstein twist! ♪♪

1304
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:22,670
Let us in, let us
in, let us in, let us in!

1305
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,560
Oh, where the hell is Spider?

1306
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,310
- Oh, how many times are
you going to say that?

1307
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:33,020
- Well, where the hell is
Spider?

1308
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,350
- He told me that he was coming
back.

1309
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,110
- Did he say when?

1310
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:38,610
Sorry.

1311
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,860
Sorry Jake I know it's not your
fault.

1312
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,440
Thanks for getting the place
open.

1313
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:42,400
Okay.

1314
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,990
I will work Spider's
line and take the cash.

1315
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:44,740
- Oh good!

1316
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,610
Here's your cash bags.

1317
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,530
- Thank you.

1318
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,120
Wait, Darryl come here.

1319
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
If I'm going to cover for
Spider,

1320
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,660
you have to cover for me.

1321
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,540
I am entrusting you with
the chainsaw finale.

1322
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,460
- Why me?

1323
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,170
- Claire recommended you.

1324
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,170
- Yeah.

1325
01:04:59,210 --> 01:04:59,880
I'm there!

1326
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,800
Show me what to do.

1327
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
- Nothing to it.

1328
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,960
Here's the throttle,
this is the chain lock.

1329
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,170
Now, keep that lock on.

1330
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,300
Without that lock on you
could level a fucking forest.

1331
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,590
So, for tonight, lock on.

1332
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,300
Okay?

1333
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,260
Now, try and rev her up.

1334
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,390
Jam it there between your knees,

1335
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:12,600
pull that cord as hard as you
can.

1336
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:15,020
Straight up.

1337
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:18,060
- Put a bit of mustard on it.

1338
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,440
And off!

1339
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:24,570
Good, you have earned the orange
mask.

1340
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:25,530
But don't get cocky.

1341
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,610
I don't want you trying to bury

1342
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:27,780
that thing into somebody's
stomach.

1343
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,570
Just chase them around with it.

1344
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,410
Good.

1345
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:31,200
Okay.

1346
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,370
Everyone, take your positions!

1347
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:37,500
Let us in!

1348
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,630
Let us in!

1349
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,500
Let us in!

1350
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,920
Let us in!

1351
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,000
- Shut up!

1352
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,170
Shut up!

1353
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,260
Shut up!

1354
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,380
- Hey Oliver!

1355
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:47,340
Hey, where's Spidey?

1356
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,720
You too cheap to pay him?

1357
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,510
- How do you know he's not
in there somewhere, huh?

1358
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,430
Waiting for you!

1359
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,980
Let the slaughter begin!

1360
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,190
Get in you date-less wonders!

01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,840

1367
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,320
- And pull.

1368
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:53,950
- Oh man.

1369
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,830
Oh my god.
- This is disgusting.

1370
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,110
- Would ya, would ya hurry up!

1371
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,190
- All right, all right,

1372
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,610
I'm here now I've got a
shit-load of tens.

1373
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,950
Have a nice scare.

1374
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,870
- Oliver.
- Yeah.

1375
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:35,830
- I've got to go to work.

1376
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:37,080
- Oh okay, save me a table.

1377
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,160
I'll be there at two.

1378
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,450
- Gotta pinch a loaf!
- What?

1379
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,670
- Yeah, I've got to drop
the kids off at the pool!

1380
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:42,500
- Hurry up!

1381
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,420
- Damn!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1382
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,810
- Awesome!
- That was sick!

1383
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,900
- That bloody guy coming
from the wall was new!

1384
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,030
- Everything okay?

1385
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:10,570
- Great!

1386
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:11,530
I just have to 'go' bad.

1387
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:12,450
- Oh, there's someone in there.

1388
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,870
Oh, me next!

1389
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:17,870
- Hey, I wouldn't go
in there if I were you.

1390
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:20,790
- Man, I gotta do this
fast and get back at it.

1391
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:22,210
Uh, no time for airing out!

1392
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,460
Heads up!

1393
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,500
- If I'm not back in three
hours, call the cops!

1394
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:05,210
- Back to slice and dice!

1395
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,340
- Oh my gosh it's all wet in
there.

1396
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:20,850
- You've have blood all over
you.

1397
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,270
- So do you!

1398
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,250
- Hey, you found my axe-

1399
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,680
- Dad, this is so fake.

1400
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,650
- Uh, that's stupid.
- Not even scary.

1401
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:18,360
- Try scaring somebody next
time.

1402
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:23,990
This had better not
stain.

1403
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,500
- I think it's just like
invisible ink.

1404
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,870
I think it will just
disappear after a few minutes.

1405
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,370
- Oh, I don't think so.

1406
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,380
Look at this.

1407
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,000
- Maybe it's cherry juice or
something.

1408
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,050
- Oh God, it tastes like blood.

1409
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:40,640
- Back off!

1410
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,550
That bitch's been
following us the whole way.

1411
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,100
Get a life!

1412
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,270
- What's going on?

1413
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,640
- I don't know, there's
something wrong with Tracy.

1414
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:47,890
- Is she hurt or sick?
- I don't know,

1415
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:49,980
I can't tell with this damn
costume.

1416
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,230
- Oh Jesus, she's been stabbed!

1417
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,400
- I think I'm going to be sick.

1418
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,040
- Someone just got stabbed!

1419
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,290
- Excellent!
- Let's go.

1420
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,750
- Whoa-whoa, wait!

1421
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:11,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

1422
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,130
just a slight technical
snafu, I will be right back.

1423
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:17,340
I will be right back.

1424
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,090
Shit.

1425
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:22,890
- Heh, yeah, this blows chunks,
dude.

1426
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:27,720
- Hey sexy, you want to suck on
this?

1427
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,570
- I don't know, I don't know.

1428
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:44,700
The only thing I can think is,

1429
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,830
we have this chair that shoots
blades

1430
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,290
through a dummy's chest.

1431
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,660
No, I, I know it's Halloween
and you've been getting

1432
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:53,000
a lot of crank calls, but
I'm telling you this is real.

1433
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:53,830
Just hurry.

1434
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,380
Just hurry!

1435
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,130
- Okay.

1436
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:57,380
I'm calling this a night.

1437
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,250
I'm going to-

1438
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,260
- There's a big fight outside!

1439
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,380
- Son of a bitch!

1440
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:03,590
I'll go break it up and
wait for the paramedics.

1441
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,550
- I'm okay, I've got
pressure on the wound.

1442
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,640
- Okay.

1443
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,810
Claire, you've got to get
everybody out of that maze.

1444
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,150
- Shit!

1445
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,240
- What's going on?

1446
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,530
- Please move to the exits.

1447
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,240
Thank you.

1448
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:30,370
- Boo!

1449
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,200
This place sucks!

1450
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,120
I want my money back.

1451
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,250
- Please move to the exit.

1452
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:35,000
Oliver will refund your
admission outside.

1453
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:35,790
Asshole.

1454
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,920
Thank you!

1455
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,300
The exit is that way.

1456
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,550
- Oh, man, this place is
so much more effective

1457
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,850
with music and lights.

1458
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:48,140
Hi!

1459
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:48,850
Claire!

1460
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:49,930
- Oh, sorry about this.

1461
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:50,970
Look you'll get your money back.

1462
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,060
Please just move to the-

1463
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,400
- Look, I said we're closed.

1464
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,490
- I don't think you understand.

1465
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:08,830
We came all the way across
town and stood in line

1466
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:11,160
for two goddamn hours!

1467
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,330
- Calm down.

1468
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,040
Hold on.

1469
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:13,910
We've had an accident.

1470
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,830
- Oww, shit.

1471
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:15,960
- We're waiting for an
ambulance.

1472
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,830
Oh, I don't have time for this.

1473
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,630
Where's Claire?

1474
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:18,500
- I don't know.

1475
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,630
- I'll be right back.

1476
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:22,210
- Uh, I, I'm going to
wait for the ambulance.

1477
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:25,380
- Two fuckin' hours!

1478
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,220
- Claire?

1479
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:34,850
Oh my God.

1480
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,350
Claire.

1481
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,440
Claire!

1482
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:39,860
- Oh Claire.

1483
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:42,480
Sweet, sweet Claire

1484
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,740
- Have you seen Claire?

1485
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,450
- No.

1486
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,280
Is the ambulance here?

1487
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,200
- I don't think so.

1488
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,240
Bart and Margo are outside.

1489
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,040
I'm going to call the police.

1490
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:54,830
Where's Sparks Malloy?

1491
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:57,710
- What?
- My fucking taser!

1492
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
- Don't get up!

1493
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,250
Don't move!

1494
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,590
Just lie there.

1495
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:10,050
That's right, just lie like in
death.

1496
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,140
Lie.

1497
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,570
That's you, Claire.

1498
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:24,570
That's my Claire.

1499
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:26,400
I did it for you.

1500
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,530
I, I did this all for you!

1501
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,240
Yes!

1502
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,620
Claire!

1503
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,620
Yes, you wanted this.

1504
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,370
This!

1505
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,540
And I've come for you.

1506
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,830
I know all about you.

1507
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:44,500
I know, I know how you love
death!

1508
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:48,340
I know how it, it thrills you...

1509
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,760
like it thrills me!

1510
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:57,100
It took me three years of
watching you and practicing.

1511
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,770
And you, you,

1512
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:06,150
you taught me how to cut.

1513
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:09,820
Oh.

1514
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,990
We'd watch you on those
long quiet afternoons

1515
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:16,700
when you didn't think anyone was
looking.

1516
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:21,120
You didn't see us, but we saw
you.

1517
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:24,420
We'd lean up to the glass

1518
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:27,670
between the branches and the
boxes.

1519
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,260
And we'd watch you through

1520
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,430
the Christmas window.

1521
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,760
- Yes, right away please.

1522
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:40,690
Well, I think we have a
dangerous situation here.

1523
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,150
Yes, I think so.

1524
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:46,520
Look, one was wounded
and another was killed.

1525
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:48,150
- What's going on, Oliver?

1526
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:49,820
- Just get the cops here.

1527
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,320
I don't know what's going on.

1528
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,990
Don't go in there!

1529
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,570
Jake's dead.

1530
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,620
- What?

1531
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,530
Where's Claire?

1532
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:57,490
- I don't know.

1533
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,540
I sent her in to get everybody
out-

1534
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,580
- The ambulance is here!

1535
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,250
- Darryl, don't do it.

1536
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:03,370
They're here for Tracy.

1537
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,290
The police are on their
way, let them do it.

1538
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,460
- Claire is in there!

1539
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,300
- Something else is in
there and it killed Jake.

1540
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,510
You're a kid in a costume.

1541
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:11,880
What are you gonna do?

1542
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,890
- I'm going after Claire!

1543
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,270
- You know what's funny, Claire?

1544
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,560
You cut to feel alive.

1545
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,440
I cut to kill!

1546
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,820
I used to try to cut to feel
alive, I,

1547
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,530
I would cut, and I'd cut, and
I'd

1548
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:35,240
cut and I would cut,

1549
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,870
but it never felt good

1550
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,040
till I met you.

1551
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,160
And I watched how you

1552
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,630
did yourself so lovingly.

1553
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:49,090
You inspired me so.

1554
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:54,050
And I grew to love you so much.

1555
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:58,760
I had to have you be a part of
me.

1556
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,220
To show my devotion.

1557
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:03,560
My devotion.

1558
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,230
My devotion.

1559
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,190
The pleasure of pain, right?

1560
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:13,440
The pleasure of pain,
the pleasure. I did this

1561
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,450
for you, Claire!

1562
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,000
- Claire?

1563
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,500
- Not you!

1564
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,630
Not you, Claire!

1565
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:33,460
Don't be like all the rest
of them, a squealing pig!

1566
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:37,680
Oh, Claire, don't be scared.

1567
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,430
I'm here to fulfill your wish.

1568
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:41,100
I'm going to take you away from
here.

1569
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,640
And the best part, the best
part?

1570
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,100
I'm coming with you!

1571
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:47,980
Now that I've proven my
worthiness to you,

1572
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:52,110
I need to do for you what you
could not do for yourself.

1573
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:54,650
- Claire!
- Darryl!

1574
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:56,570
- Claire!

1575
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:07,040
- Now my darling, it is time
for me to drain you dry.

1576
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,630
Claire!

1577
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:13,000
- Then open my veins.

1578
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:13,840
- Claire!

1579
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,140
You're not a part of this!

1580
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:29,940
And then we will live together
in the eternal orgy of hell!

1581
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:42,830
- Claire!

1582
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:46,790
I'll be right back.

1583
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,990
Claire.

1584
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,090
- Come here!

1585
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:17,800
- Stupid.

1586
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,880
Stupid.

1587
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,130
Stupid!

1588
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,060
You ruined everything!

1589
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,520
You ruined my moment!

1590
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,440
It's okay.

1591
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,650
Don't worry.

1592
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:43,490
I'll be sure to tell

1593
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:45,160
Claire all about th-

1594
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,380
- Oliver!

1595
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,460
Oliver!

1596
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:09,350
- God damn it!

1597
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:10,430
Darryl!

1598
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,520
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1599
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,020
- Was it just him?

1600
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,360
- That thing was living back
there!

1601
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,940
He killed, he killed Spider.

1602
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,360
He killed all of them because of
me.

1603
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,820
- It's okay, it's okay.

1604
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,620
The police are here.

1605
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,540
They're gonna sort everything
ou-

1606
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,170
- No!

1607
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,000
No!

1608
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,660
- Excuse me, I'm looking for-
- Hey Darryl.

1609
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,830
- Hey, how are you?

1610
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:17,920
- Good.

1611
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,840
Good.

1612
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,090
- You look great.

1613
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,670
- Still working on those demons.

1614
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:27,760
- Sorry you had to come
back to work so soon.

1615
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,930
- Oh, me too.

1616
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:31,180
Therapy's expensive for a girl!

1617
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,680
- Selfishly, I'm glad you're
back.

1618
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:37,060
- God, Darryl, where
were you 10 years ago?

1619
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,560
You know, my psychoanalysis
revealed

1620
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:43,820
that I have a clinical "3M"
issue

1621
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,150
when it comes to relationships.

1622
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:48,110
Apparently I deeply believe
that all I can attract are

1623
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:50,360
maniacs, molesters and monsters.

1624
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:57,410
But hiding and disguising
myself didn't seem to help.

1625
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,370
And, it's just going to take a
while

1626
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,500
before I can shake the feeling

1627
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,090
that I bring out the worst in
men.

1628
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:06,260
- I understand.

1629
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:07,970
Take your time.

1630
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,640
When you're ready, give me call.

1631
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,640
