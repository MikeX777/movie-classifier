1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,805
I'll tell you this about my father.

3
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,015
Aah!

4
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,184
He had a heart of gold.

5
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,894
He was honest to a fault.

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,148
And he almost always smelt
like talcum powder.

7
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,823
He just really loved
his Johnson's baby powder.

8
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,243
No, but, I mean, like, a lot.

9
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,955
He'd sprinkle the stuff on himself...

10
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,375
over himself, under himself...

11
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,128
and then just for good measure,
under himself again.

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,301
Because, as he was fond of saying,
''You never know.''

13
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:37,097
To this day, if you cover my eyes
and put me across the room...

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,224
I couldn't tell you
the difference between...

15
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,768
a freshly bathed baby
and my father's balls.

16
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,313
I'm not saying that's a healthy thing.

17
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,024
I'm just saying
it's something I remember.

18
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,241
The best time I ever had
with my father...

19
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,911
was when he was having
maybe the worst time of his life.

20
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,747
Go figure, right? You never know.

21
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,290
Mom, make her stop!

22
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,709
- Lilly!
- What?

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,335
Are you jumping on the couch?

24
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,503
No.

25
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,088
I'm going to come in there
and turn off the TV.

26
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,965
- Why?
- Why? Well, did you do your reading?

27
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,550
Yeah.

28
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,011
- Well, it's getting late. It's time to--
- Lilly, quit it!

29
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,554
- Lilly!
- It's mine!

30
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,933
All right, now, it says here five-bedroom
rustic retreat with its own lake.

31
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,020
What does that mean?
It has, like, its own lake?

32
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,063
Really? Like, how big is the lake?

33
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,523
A lake? Who buys a lake?

34
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,691
- How much?
- Well...

35
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:33,069
All right, when you say you can rowboat,
like, how far could you rowboat?

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,488
- Grape.
- Daddy.

37
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,614
You could rowboat a long time...

38
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,200
or you could paddle two or three times
and then you got to turn around again?

39
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,660
You know what?
You're choking Daddy.

40
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,621
Well, that's--See, that's--
That doesn't sound to me like a lake.

41
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,915
- That's more like a pond, frankly.
- Honey, forget it.

42
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,585
Maybe not even a pond.
That could be just a small wet area.

43
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm not kidding around! Quit it!

44
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,255
Who? The owner?

45
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,757
He has to interview us?

46
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:57,177
- Oh, see, that just sounds crazy.
- What does that mean? Huh?

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,928
OK, girls, come on, bed.

48
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,597
- Mean it.
- Really?

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,890
Come on.

50
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,100
You think it might be gone that fast?

51
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,602
Jeez. Wow.

52
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,936
Hello?

53
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,814
Oh, yeah, just to tell you,
a Mr. Kleinman is on his way up.

54
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,858
- Mr. Kleinman?
- I don't have to--

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,610
Honey, are we doing something
with your parents?

56
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,736
My parents?

57
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,280
Uh...

58
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,241
Not going to stay long.
Just came by for a quick howdy do.

59
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,119
- Hi.
- What--Where's--Where's Mom?

60
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,998
Uh, she's, uh...
Uh, she's going to come later.

61
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,958
She--So, you came by yourself?

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,418
- Yeah.
- Hiya, Papi!

63
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,381
Oh. Did you get more beautiful?
Huh? Huh?

64
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,007
I think you did.

65
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,092
So, you just came just like this?

66
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,220
Yeah. Look at this face. Mmm.

67
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,056
- Well, is everything OK?
- Huh? Yeah, sure. Why?

68
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,516
Well, no, I mean, because
you usually don't--

69
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,519
- Hi, Papi.
- Oh, there she is.

70
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,354
- Oh, yeah.
- I--I'm just--

71
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,231
What are you doing in the city?

72
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,192
It's a problem for a person
to come and say hello?

73
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,568
No, of course you can, but, I mean--

74
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,196
Uh-oh.
You're probably in the middle of dinner.

75
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,656
- Dinner was--
- Dinner? No, no.

76
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,408
We're actually just
getting the girls to bed.

77
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,534
Because I can come back another time.

78
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,953
No, no, don't be silly.
Girls, go and brush your teeth.

79
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,540
- Now, you're sure?
- Absolutely. Girls, go.

80
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,126
- They're not going.
- What did Mom say? Go, go, go, go.

81
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,294
- Come on, come on, school.
- I'm not washing my whole face.

82
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,381
All right, well, just do
the sticky parts, then. Let's go. Come on.

83
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:20,593
Listen, you do whatever you have to do.
I'm not even here.

84
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,387
Are you hungry?

85
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,014
No. No, no, no.

86
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,306
You know,
because I can heat up some pasta.

87
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,559
No. No, no, no, no.

88
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,103
- Are you sure everything is all right?
- Yeah, sure, fine.

89
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,147
I just--I'm a little confused
as to why Mom is not here.

90
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,190
Oh, I just wanted to show you something.

91
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,316
What?

92
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,860
There's a little something
I want to show you.

93
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,070
- OK, show me what?
- I'll show you later.

94
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,948
- Show me now.
- Daddy, will you brush my hair?

95
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,408
Yeah, yeah, just a second.

96
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,161
Go, go. Brush their hair. We'll talk after.

97
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:50,623
- Daddy.
- Yeah, OK, OK.

98
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,167
You don't want anything? A drink?

99
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,918
No. No, no, no.

100
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,171
- Juice?
- No, no, no.

101
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,214
- Coffee?
- No, no.

102
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,759
OK, coffee I'll have.

103
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,010
OK.

104
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,850
OK. OK, good. Hey, hey.

105
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,560
What are you doing?

106
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,687
I forgot to do my reading.

107
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,232
All right, all right, go ahead,
but then I want you asleep, all right?

108
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,527
- Thanks for being my baby girl.
- Thanks for being my daddy.

109
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,779
What's your story?

110
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,823
Can we snuggle till I'm sleeping?

111
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,534
- You going to fall asleep fast?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,204
- All right, scoot over.
- Ha ha!

113
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,331
Come on, come on, come on.

114
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:35,377
OK. Make some room for me, you.

115
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,836
Thanks for being my baby girl.

116
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,506
- Thanks for being my daddy.
- Yeah.

117
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,681
OK. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

118
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,308
Okey-dokey.

119
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,477
They're down.

120
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,034
What's the matter?

121
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,956
It's from your mom.

122
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,959
I found it on the refrigerator.

123
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,675
I don't understand.
What is it? What does that mean?

124
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,759
''I'm leaving.''

125
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,221
Like it says, she's leaving.

126
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,266
- I don't understand.
- Welcome to the club.

127
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,684
Did you guys have a fight or something?

128
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,562
No fight. Everything fine.

129
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,856
Really? So, why...

130
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:42,360
She'd just had enough.

131
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,696
What?
So, where--where is she going to go?

132
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,115
- Read.
- ''I don't know where I'm going to go.''

133
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,450
Even she don't know.

134
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,285
''All these years have flown by...

135
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,579
''and I don't know
where they've gone, either.

136
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,873
''I know I was a young woman
when we met...

137
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,792
''but for the life of me,
I don't know what happened to her.

138
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:02,255
''I need to be somewhere else now,
and I need to be there alone.

139
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,924
I hope you'll understand.
Love, Muriel.''

140
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,262
Jesus.

141
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,723
Jesus.

142
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,934
Tell us what we can do.

143
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,605
I don't know.
I figured I'd give it a day or two.

144
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,440
Wait a second.
When did you find this?

145
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,816
Monday.

146
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,402
And you're just telling us about it now?

147
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,030
- I didn't want to worry anybody.
- Oh, for God's sake.

148
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,656
Who are you calling? The police?

149
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,949
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,701
''Hey, there's a woman out there
in her seventies...

151
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,371
5'4'' and very angry.
Take a look around.''

152
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,914
- Linda, hey.
- Linda?

153
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,625
- Linda doesn't know.
- Have you spoken to Mom lately?

154
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,959
You're going to involve
your sisters now?

155
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,962
- Well, how did she sound, then?
- She sounded fine. Why?

156
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,047
You don't know about this letter?

157
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,007
- What letter?
- Benny, she's got her own problems.

158
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,425
What letter?

159
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,720
She I--She left a note. She--

160
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,806
Mom left Dad, basically.

161
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,849
Really? Good for her.

162
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,851
- Hey.
- What? What'd she say?

163
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,229
- She says she can't believe it.
- Well, believe it.

164
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,606
Hey, ready for this? Mom left Dad.

165
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,274
What? What do you mean?

166
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,694
- She left him a letter.
- Who are you talking to?

167
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,070
- It's Hillary.
- What's she doing there?

168
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,697
She came by to borrow
the land cruiser.

169
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,739
- Who?
- Hillary.

170
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,782
- Hillary?
- Hillary.

171
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,951
- What is she doing there?
- She came over to borrow her car.

172
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,244
What does she need the car for?

173
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,664
Really? That's what
you want to talk about now?

174
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,542
She actually, like, took clothes
in a suitcase and went somewhere?

175
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,168
Apparently, yeah.

176
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,795
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

177
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,880
- "Holy" shit.
- Holy shit.

178
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,508
- What?
- They're--They're shocked.

179
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,051
They're both--They're expressing shock.

180
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,303
- Did they speak to Bonnie?
- Did you speak to Bonnie?

181
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,848
No, I haven't spoken to Bonnie
since July.

182
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,182
No.

183
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,601
Four kids--does something like this,
doesn't tell anybody.

184
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,270
OK, would you--would you
give her a call?

185
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,772
- It's her turn to call me.
- Oh, would you stop? Just grow up.

186
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,940
Please. Give her a call.

187
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,401
She's going to hate that we know
something before she does.

188
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,569
Just--Linda, please.

189
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,071
OK. Hold on. Watch.

190
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,449
''What do you mean?
Why did no one tell me?

191
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,575
You know how much I worry.''

192
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,827
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

193
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,913
Well, hi. What a nice surprise.
How are you?

194
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,125
I'm all right. Listen, there's a bit
of a thing, though, with Mom and Dad.

195
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,418
Oh, my God.
I knew it. I had a dream last night.

196
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,629
- No, no. Everyone is fine.
- OK, what happened? Just tell me.

197
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,467
- So?
- She's calling Bonnie.

198
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,219
Yeah. He's over there now.
Ben called me, and I'm calling you.

199
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,346
Great.

200
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,973
Why I'm the last one to find out,
I'll never know.

201
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,350
- Bonnie--
- Oldest child...

202
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,517
last one to hear about everything.

203
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,062
- OK, whatever.
- So, you don't know anything about this.

204
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,772
No! Jesus, what do you think? I--

205
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,275
OK, OK. I got to call you back.

206
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,610
She doesn't know a thing.

207
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,695
- Oy.
- So, now what?

208
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,864
Uh, I--Now, I don't know.

209
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,449
Is he going to stay there
with you tonight?

210
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,159
Yes, of course he's going
to stay with us tonight.

211
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,370
- No, no. No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

212
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,830
You cannot drive home at this hour.
You're going to sleep here with us.

213
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,124
- I am not going to sleep with you.
- Yes, you are.

214
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,669
- I'm not discussing this.
- No, no, no, no.

215
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,921
- I have no pajamas.
- Pajamas. You hearing this?

216
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,506
Ben has pajamas.

217
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,175
Well, how is he? He must be so lost.

218
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,177
- No, he's fine.
- I'm fine.

219
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,512
- He's fine.
- Of course I'm fine.

220
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,389
- Yeah.
- It's just a screwy mix-up.

221
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,682
There you go.

222
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,684
A little screwy mix-up?
Is that what he thinks this is?

223
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,810
He doesn't get it.

224
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,561
Would you get her feet
off of there, please?

225
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,313
Jeez.

226
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,732
OK, what is your tomorrow?

227
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,860
Well, now I don't know. I was--
I was thinking of driving upstate.

228
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,112
I was gonna go look at a house.

229
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,531
- Perfect. Take Daddy.
- Take him with me?

230
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,116
Yeah, keep him moving, distracted.

231
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,410
I'll get on the phone here,
get to the bottom of this.

232
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,536
I'm not that worried.

233
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,954
- What?
- No, she's saying--

234
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,330
She's saying everything
is gonna be all right.

235
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,040
Of course
everything's gonna be all right.

236
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,917
- I'm not even worried.
- Liar.

237
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,544
Good-bye.

238
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,021
And you would really go live on a farm?

239
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,856
It's not a farm. It's a farmhouse.

240
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,693
Farmhouse--it's a house with land.

241
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,819
It's just a--you know...

242
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,822
it's something we've been talking about
for a while, and--and--

243
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,408
'Cause I don't know if we want the girls
to grow up in this city.

244
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,994
- I mean, is that--
- Well, the suburbs I could understand.

245
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,206
Yeah, but I just like
the idea of the country.

246
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,791
You know? It appeals to me.

247
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,168
You know, it's--it's safe, it's quiet.

248
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,753
I could do my writing there.

249
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,465
What does that mean, a farm?
You'd have like, what, chickens?

250
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,050
No, no, no. Not chickens.

251
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,343
It's not a farm. It's just--

252
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,803
Yeah, I mean,
you could grow stuff if you want.

253
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,055
You could grow tomatoes or corn
or something, I'm sure.

254
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,556
In upstate New York?

255
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,100
Yeah, you could--Why not?

256
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,894
Well, New Jersey has the fantastic corn.

257
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,146
All right, well, you know what?
The point isn't to grow corn--

258
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,148
New York is, I think,
maybe too cold for corn.

259
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,276
Forget I said corn. Drop the corn.
The point is the house.

260
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,903
You go, and it's a house
in the country, so--

261
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,322
- It sounds like a nice thing.
- Yeah, I understand.

262
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,740
Just a quiet place in the country.

263
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,284
Yeah, yeah. That's all.
A house in the country.

264
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:27,539
Well, you're not gonna buy it
without looking at it first, though, right?

265
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:31,126
What are we doing? We're going--
We're driving to go look at it, right?

266
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,670
'Cause, you know, you never know.

267
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,798
No, I know. I know.

268
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,553
So, what do you know?

269
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,972
I had a thought,
but no one wanted to hear it.

270
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,140
What?

271
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,058
Well, if she's that fed up
with your father...

272
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,563
wouldn't she maybe want to look up
an old boyfriend or something?

273
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,273
No.
That's my mother we're talking about.

274
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,191
I'm not saying
she had a lover or anything.

275
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,987
Please. Please. Whoever she's gonna
call is already married or dead.

276
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,989
I should just turn around and
come home right now, shouldn't I?

277
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,074
No, no. Let us look for her.

278
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,744
You're doing the best thing
for your dad right now.

279
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,288
- How's he doing?
- He's, you know...

280
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,374
I hit the sink thing!
It sprayed all over me!

281
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,751
What? What's happening?

282
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,044
- Uh...oy.
- How is he?

283
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,171
Damn sink sprayed me, but good.

284
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,380
Hon?

285
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,758
I don't know. He--

286
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,052
- He looks older.
- He is.

287
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,428
Who's that? Rachel?

288
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,721
- Yeah.
- Anything?

289
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,972
Nothing yet.

290
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,726
Hey, you know what?
Try and have fun with him today.

291
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,229
You always say
you never had time together, right?

292
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,857
So, maybe this is...the good thing.

293
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,151
All right. Here he comes. Gotta go.

294
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,778
OK, take it easy. I love you.

295
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,363
- Love you, too.
- All right.

296
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,455
So, it's OK?
You can take a day off like this?

297
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,249
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just had
a magazine piece that was due.

298
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,794
I just turned that in yesterday,
so I'm good.

299
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,672
And your book? It's still, uh...

300
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,423
The book? No, no.
No, working on the book.

301
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,133
Still writing, yeah. But it's--

302
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,760
You know, listen,
three and a half years in...

303
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,846
and taking one afternoon off
is not gonna kill me.

304
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,349
You know, I went into the bookstore
in the mall.

305
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,558
- Oh, yeah, yeah?
- Yeah.

306
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,686
I thought I'd see
if they had your other book.

307
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,146
- Ha ha. OK. And?
- They don't.

308
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,649
They don't. Oh, well.
No, they don't carry everything.

309
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,110
The big stores--You know,
in the mall, they're not gonna--

310
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,821
You know who they have a lot of?
John Grisham.

311
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,032
My God. This guy--
one book after another, this guy!

312
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,451
He's fast. He's fast.

313
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,002
How'd you know it was me?

314
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,883
I think this is it.

315
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,511
- Wow.
- Plenty of room here.

316
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,097
Look at this!

317
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,182
Do you believe
this is all the same place?

318
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,768
Lot of mowing and pruning.

319
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,188
You're gonna have to get
one of those mowers with a chair on it.

320
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,858
Ha ha ha! Oh, wow.

321
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,651
So, this would be the driveway.

322
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,071
You hear that? Listen to that.
The pebbles against the tires.

323
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,906
- Gravel is good.
- Oh, yeah.

324
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,953
Oh, I like this. I like this.

325
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,498
Mr. Harrison?

326
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,168
That I am. Mr. Kleinman?

327
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,878
- Yes, sir!
- That's me.

328
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,838
Hi. Ben Kleinman.

329
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,922
Well, hello.

330
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,341
Hi. This is my father.

331
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,593
- Sam Kleinman. How are you?
- Pleasure.

332
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,345
You've got a spectacular place here.

333
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,347
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,934
Uh...oh, uh, I'll tell you...

335
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,271
why don't you two fellas talk,
and I'll just mosey around?

336
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,190
Terrific. Great. Thank you.

337
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,941
Well, shall I show you around?

338
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,361
Please. That would be just terrific.

339
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,363
How was your trip up? All right?

340
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,865
My great-grandmother's family...

341
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,992
gave her this land
on her eighteenth birthday.

342
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,285
Is that right? Huh.

343
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,288
And my great-grandfather
built the house with his own hands.

344
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,624
- Really?
- Right after the Civil War.

345
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,252
Wow. It's just--
It's a magical place.

346
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,129
It's important that you feel that way.

347
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,965
Oh, I do. I do. Heh.

348
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,816
My father and I
shot moose and wild boar...

349
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,734
just inside those woods over there.

350
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,194
Wow. Heh.

351
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,155
The moose are gone now, by and large.

352
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,991
Time marches on,
with or without our consent.

353
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,076
Hmm.

354
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,286
I will tell you this, though--

355
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,872
whoever lives here next...

356
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:42,043
will have the finest golden corner
of God's green earth.

357
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,587
Boy, you got some place here!

358
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,047
That lake? Ooh!

359
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,382
We've been very blessed.

360
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,051
Let me ask you something.
The septic tank--

361
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,928
what kind of system
did they put in here?

362
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,054
Do you know?

363
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,806
I beg your pardon?

364
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,392
I mean, it doesn't drain
right into the lake, does it?

365
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,186
Because I see the other houses
up on the hill there...

366
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,400
and I got to figure, if all that's draining
into your water--oh, boy.

367
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:11,614
Come the hot weather,
this place is gonna stink to high hell.

368
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,332
Let me tell you something.

369
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,628
If a guy is selling you a house,
and he don't want you to ask questions...

370
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,422
you don't want the house.

371
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,007
- Right.
- Am I wrong?

372
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,425
No. I'm saying--you're right.

373
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,844
Your old man is not as dumb
as you think, you know.

374
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,846
Your mother and I,
we looked at a house once.

375
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,264
I know. Lakewood.

376
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,183
Lakewood, New Jersey. That's right.

377
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,894
We got the money into escrow,
we run an inspection...

378
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,312
what do we find?

379
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,438
Rats.

380
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,107
You'd better believe it.
Floor to ceiling.

381
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,734
The place was infested.

382
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,154
So believe me,
there is always a reason.

383
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,199
- Always.
- You're darn tootin'.

384
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,743
- There's always a reason.
- Right.

385
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,496
- And there's never not a reason.
- What?

386
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,333
Right? So, what you're saying is,
there really--there is no house...

387
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,044
that anyone could buy anywhere, ever.

388
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,212
- What?
- Right?

389
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,173
I mean, all over the world.
All over the world, no matter where...

390
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,092
no matter when,
there just is no house...

391
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,635
that anybody should buy,
you're saying...

392
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,261
because it--it's always a trick.

393
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,846
There's always some kind of scam.

394
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,683
- What are you talking about?
- So, therefore--therefore, what?

395
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,059
Don't even try?

396
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,019
Try what? I don't know
what you're saying now.

397
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,522
That's your big plan,
is don't have a dream...

398
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,191
'cause if you have a dream,
it'll only turn to shit.

399
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,818
Yeah, just leave things how they are.

400
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,821
We'll leave things how they are--nice--
and then wait till it's too late.

401
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,072
Till what's too late?

402
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,032
Yeah, just wait
till everybody's dead, right?

403
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,368
What are you gettin' so upset about?

404
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,704
- OK, that's why Mom left.
- Why?

405
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,205
You want to know why? Because of this.

406
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,417
- Because of what?
- Because of this. Because of you.

407
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,877
You got a reason not to do everything.

408
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,755
Whatever it is, there's a reason--
''No, you can't do that.''

409
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,382
She wanted a house in the country...

410
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,343
but you said, ''No, the kids are too little.''
Right? And then, all of a sudden...

411
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,221
''No, the kids are grown up.
We don't need a house in the country.''

412
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,099
She wanted to travel, but no--
''This place is too far.

413
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,059
That place, it's not far enough.''

414
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:07,063
Right? ''The winter-- it's too cold.
The summer--it's so crowded there.

415
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,273
The spring--it's rainy.''

416
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,484
Whatever it is. But you know what?
Somebody goes to these places!

417
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,403
Somebody's buying
these houses in the country!

418
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:17,032
So I gotta think
it can't be that fucking horrible!

419
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,825
You know, you're talkin' out of your ass--

420
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,785
Oh, am I? Yeah, OK.

421
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,163
When you're married forty years,
come talk to me.

422
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,416
Please. It's not the forty years.
It was always like this. You know that.

423
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,625
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

424
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,753
It was like this before I was born.

425
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,214
How do you know what the hell
things were like before you were born?

426
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,759
I--I--Just trust me, I know. I know.

427
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,218
- You know?
- Yes, I know.

428
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,055
Well, I'm telling you you don't know
what you're talking about.

429
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,514
Oh, OK.
I don't know what I'm talking about?

430
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,599
- Do me a favor.
- Really?

431
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,310
Why don't you close your mouth
and drive me back to the city?

432
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,394
I don't know what I'm talking about?

433
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,896
Good. Now, let me
show you something.

434
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,565
Let's take a look.
Let's see how much I don't know.

435
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,567
Keep your eye on the road!
Watch where you're driving!

436
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,693
I want you to see something.

437
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,446
- Hey. Hey! Jesus!
- Shit!

438
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,290
Whew. You all right?

439
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,416
Yeah.

440
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,294
Yeah. You OK?

441
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,129
I'm fine.

442
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,315
Jesus.

443
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,651
Oh, boy.

444
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,447
That's good.

445
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,241
Hey.

446
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,202
A new car you can always get.

447
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,664
I'm sorry.

448
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,004
So, what were you gonna show me?

449
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,338
Nothing.

450
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,551
Now you got my attention. Heh.

451
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,850
OK.

452
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,119
What's this?

453
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,662
It's for you.

454
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,955
From you?

455
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,749
It's from Mom.

456
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,084
What, she's leaving me again now?

457
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,170
It was so much fun the first time?

458
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:41,509
She wrote this--She wrote this
the year I was born.

459
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,554
She wrote it,
but she never gave it to you.

460
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,014
So, how did you get it?

461
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,725
When I was fourteen, I was digging
around in her nightstand drawer.

462
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,976
I was gonna steal a cigarette.

463
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,436
Your mother doesn't smoke.

464
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,397
Not smoke smoke,
but she used to--once in a while.

465
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,776
She had the same pack of Newport Lights
in there for seven years.

466
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,862
I never knew your mother smoked.

467
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,655
Well, there you go.

468
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,199
So, you took this?

469
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,869
Yeah. I still don't know
if she ever noticed it was gone.

470
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,163
And you keep this in the car?

471
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,625
No. I don't keep it in the c--

472
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,878
I dug it up to show it to you,
because I thought--

473
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,507
'Cause I--I don't know why.
Because I figured it was time.

474
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,095
''March 18--''

475
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:30,600
But that's two weeks
before you were born.

476
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,940
Why...

477
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,818
Just read.

478
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,867
Sam...

479
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,662
this is the letter that should
be pinned to a pillow...

480
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:56,167
explaining why the wife has run off
and left her husband.

481
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,753
But I have nobody to run off with...

482
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,088
nor can I run off.

483
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,093
Apparently, my life isn't even
my own to do away with.

484
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,098
In my heart,
I must take leave of you now...

485
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,477
because unless I disentangle myself
from you emotionally...

486
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,522
I'll never be a fit mother for our children.

487
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,777
I don't think you could measure
all the tears I've shed.

488
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,446
When I've needed you most...

489
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:29,117
you have found it more pressing
to be anywhere else but with me.

490
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,454
But I know it wasn't always so.

491
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,623
I know the world
was once vibrant with promise.

492
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:40,337
After all, wasn't I the girl,
fresh out of college...

493
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,006
who got the job at the very first
interview she ever had?

494
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:49,846
So what if I cancelled my plans
to go see the World's Fair in Queens?

495
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,515
I was working in Manhattan...

496
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,727
and making $1 3 a week to boot.

497
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,981
And how thrilling that you,
a handsome young boss...

498
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,025
were interested in me.

499
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,238
When you went in the army...

500
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,533
I did everything I could
to keep that office running...

501
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,203
because I was sure
this was the way to your heart.

502
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,957
How all the more humiliating
it was for me, then...

503
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,335
to watch you spend
your weekend furloughs...

504
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,629
catching up on business...

505
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,465
while I got the final fifteen minutes
at Penn Station...

506
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,384
before you shipped out again.

507
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:33,348
I must have loved you an awful lot
to have been so hurt.

508
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,102
In fact, sometimes I almost wish...

509
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,104
you would have yourself
a love affair...

510
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:42,148
so that you would know
how the heart can be affected.

511
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,112
Oh, I guess you loved me
in your way...

512
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,489
as part of the whole picture--

513
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,909
a comfortable life taken for granted.

514
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,582
But believe me, it's not enough.

515
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,877
Maybe it's all I'm meant to get...

516
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:08,717
but, please, don't let anybody
ever treat our girls this way.

517
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,639
From here on,
I'll stop hoping you'll change.

518
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,769
I won't expect evenings
to be different from each other...

519
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,439
nor weekends different from workdays.

520
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,566
I won't expect anything anymore.

521
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,570
But you have destroyed a marriage.

522
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:38,246
P.S.: Congratulations.
You finally have your son.

523
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,457
I hope he brings you much pleasure.

524
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,460
As for me, I'm glad he's here...

525
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,879
but I still miss your tenderness...

526
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:49,632
your thoughtfulness,
even your politeness.

527
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:54,012
I don't know if you have it in you,
but I yearn for it.

528
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:59,225
Maybe someday, when
you have nothing else on your mind.

529
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,999
Bullshit.

530
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,502
What?

531
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,420
Bullshit.

532
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,048
What do you mean, bullshit?

533
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:35,387
I'm saying that this is a crock of b-u-l-l--
bullshit!

534
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,473
That is not the way it was.

535
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,975
- How what was?
- All of it!

536
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,229
- Well--
- Bullshit!

537
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,897
You think it was like that?

538
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,275
I don't know what it was like,
but that's--that's what she wrote.

539
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,277
I mean, that's--that's what she felt.

540
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,488
That I'm a prick?

541
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,408
Your father is such a callous...

542
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,369
uncaring son of a bitch...

543
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,371
that he ruined the marriage...

544
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,374
that he made your mother
that miserable?

545
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,670
Let me tell you something,
sonny boy.

546
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:12,924
I busted my ass
building that business.

547
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,300
You're damn right.

548
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:18,430
You know what Crown Carpet was
when we started?

549
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,724
Two guys, a desk, and a clipboard.

550
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,891
That was it!

551
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,352
Did I have to stay at the office
late a lot?

552
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,062
You bet I did.

553
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,523
Did I have to travel
all over the goddamn place...

554
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,275
here and there,
drummin' up business?

555
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,693
You bet I did.

556
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,237
Because that's what had to be done!

557
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,074
So, did I miss out on a lot of nice things?

558
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,703
Yes, I missed out on a lot of nice things.

559
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,873
Does that make me uncaring?

560
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:47,125
A rotten husband?

561
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,461
A rotten father?

562
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,090
Crown Carpets fed you kids...

563
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,761
sent you to the best schools,
the best summer camps.

564
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:01,348
Who of your friends ever went away
to such nice places, huh?

565
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:05,018
Mexico, Puerto Rico that time...

566
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,896
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

567
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,774
Who was that for? For me?

568
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:15,028
I need to take a vacation
to see another factory?

569
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,238
To see how they make chocolate?

570
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:23,286
I don't give a shit how they make it,
but I went for you and for the family.

571
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,874
Don't you dare tell me
I wasn't there for you kids.

572
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,544
She never got to go to the World's Fair.

573
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,463
That's my fault.

574
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,798
Fifty years later.

575
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,301
You want to go to the World's Fair?
Go! Who's stopping you?

576
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,929
That I had an affair. Bullshit!

577
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,890
- No, she didn't say that you had an--
- Never!

578
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,141
- She said that--
- Never!

579
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,227
What she said was
she almost wishes you had.

580
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,105
She wishes I had.
What kind of craziness is that?

581
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,149
She wishes you had, so then
you would've known what--what it--

582
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,236
That is pure crazy shit.

583
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,407
Never so much as a dalliance.

584
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,826
Never.

585
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,623
The other fellas, yes.

586
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:11,793
I'm not saying
it's unheard of in the office.

587
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,545
I'm not an innocent.
Bernie Kaye--

588
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,880
you remember Bernie Kaye,
the sales rep?

589
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:20,093
Shtupped everything that moved
between Baltimore and Syracuse.

590
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,137
Legendary cocksman.

591
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,638
Boasted about it.

592
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,892
And his wife, by the way, adores him.

593
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,603
Thinks he's the greatest thing
since Ovaltine.

594
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:36,985
But me--me, who never once so much
as laid a finger on another woman...

595
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:41,614
me, your mother had to run away
from after 47 years...

596
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:46,119
because I'm such
an unconscionable prick.

597
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,584
Well, maybe
I shouldn't have shown you--

598
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:56,087
You're damn right
you shouldn't have shown me!

599
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:59,049
And look at your car!
You gonna call somebody to fix it?

600
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,177
- I'm gonna call--
- Or is it gonna fix by itself sitting there?

601
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:06,139
- I'm gonna call someone.
- Good, because I'm goddamn hungry now.

602
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,851
And aggravated. And I have to pee.

603
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,811
And you know what?

604
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,272
I'm gonna pee right here.

605
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,774
Go ahead.

606
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,650
You're damn right I'm goin' ahead!

607
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:22,113
And I don't need permission from you.

608
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,492
You hear that, everybody?!

609
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,745
Sam Kleinman, Fair Lawn, New Jersey...

610
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,499
and I'm gonna pee
wherever I goddamn please!

611
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:47,305
That really burns my ass.

612
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,766
I'm not polite?

613
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,310
Who's more polite than me?

614
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,480
Come on, tell me.

615
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:00,944
That really burns my ass.

616
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,455
You're lucky I heard the phone
when I did.

617
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,207
I was nearly halfway to my car.

618
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,167
We're closed for the night.

619
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:20,171
What do you mean, closed? But you're--
you're gonna fix this first, right?

620
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:24,259
My wife is making chicken paprikash,
and that is one dish I do not want to miss.

621
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,970
OK. All right, but can you just--
You know what?

622
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,222
If you can just get it
so I can drive it out of here--

623
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,433
Oh, there's no way
we can do anything tonight.

624
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,853
You come back in the morning.
I'll be here at the crack of 7:00.

625
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:37,439
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
I can't stay.

626
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,983
Come on.
You'll stay the night in a nice motel...

627
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,568
and you come back here
in the morning.

628
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,611
What do you say? Come on.

629
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,323
The official said North Korea
has massed--

630
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:50,744
No, we're fine, we're fine.
Just the car's not so fine.

631
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,663
Jeez, Benny. Don't hit trees with cars.

632
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,874
- I know.
- Trees always win.

633
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,251
Yeah, I know, I know.
How are my girls. They miss me?

634
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,586
You mean since breakfast?

635
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,963
Is that all I'm gone?
Jeez, it feels like a year.

636
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:07,719
I wonder if Tom Brokaw's wife is upset
because he's working late.

637
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,971
You see his phone ringing off the hook?

638
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,557
''Just wanted you to know
your dinner's cold...

639
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,976
and the children all agree
you're a shitheel.''

640
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,811
- You hearing this?
- Yeah.

641
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,855
Us that work and give and give and give!

642
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:22,484
- This--This is who I've created.
- A man has to say, ''That's it!

643
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,235
I'm not givin' any more!''

644
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,653
When "Nightly News" continues...

645
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,698
You go, Tom.
You do whatever you have to do.

646
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,951
- I'll wait right here for you.
- Wait, that's the other line. Hang on.

647
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:34,871
I'm not the kind of person who runs off
because he's bored...

648
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,040
because he needs to find himself.

649
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:41,378
You know where to find me, my friend--
exactly where I said I'd be.

650
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:46,091
That's right.
Right here, baby! Right here!

651
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,717
You want a grapefruit juice?

652
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,844
OK, your sisters
are like little detectives now.

653
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,012
Hang on.

654
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,305
- Are you there?
- I'm here.

655
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,641
- Hey, look at that.
- All right, where is Mom gonna go?

656
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,434
Where has she always wanted to go?

657
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:57,894
My first thought was France...

658
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,479
because, you know,
Dad never wanted to go there.

659
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,315
But then I thought, maybe California.

660
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,400
Why?

661
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,069
Well, you know those friends of hers--
the husband's a periodontist?

662
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,571
- The Schechners?
- Oh, the Schechners. That's it.

663
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,989
I could not think of their names.

664
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,533
She's gonna leave her husband
of 47 years...

665
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:12,992
to be with
Marty and Charlotte Schechner?

666
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,036
Well, it's possible, no?

667
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,830
Yeah, but she's always
talking about them.

668
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,124
Hold on a second. Hold on.
I got a call here.

669
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,962
So...how's the motel?

670
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,922
It's dark and smells like toast.

671
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,340
It's Hillary.
Should I try to put her on?

672
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:30,844
- How are you gonna put her on?
- Let me--Let me see. Did I lose you?

673
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,470
- I'm here.
- Are you guys still there?

674
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,556
- Still here.
- That's very impressive.

675
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,182
- Look at that.
- So, what do you got?

676
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,768
OK, listen to this.
I'm in Mom and Dad's house...

677
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:39,978
I'm in the kitchen.

678
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:45,108
I open up Mom's desk drawer--
big color travel brochure for Africa.

679
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,277
- Africa?
- Stop it.

680
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,405
I saw the brochure.
''Come, visit majestic Africa.''

681
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,615
And she's got, like,
safari prices circled.

682
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,451
Mom is not going to Africa.

683
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,578
You see,
I think I have to agree with that one.

684
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,496
Well, I talked to Bonnie,
and she doesn't believe...

685
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,457
Mom would actually leave the country.

686
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,792
Thinks she probably went
to a spa or something.

687
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:03,918
Like, maybe Florida.

688
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,628
OK, good. So, Paris, Kenya...

689
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,839
and Boca Raton
we got it narrowed down to.

690
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:11,259
Nobody's going to Boca Raton
this time of the year.

691
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:13,011
It's 1 30 degrees there.

692
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,139
What?

693
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,435
OK, somebody just shoot me,
would you?

694
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,047
Oh ho ho! That tree jumped out
and bit you pretty good! Ha ha ha!

695
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,550
Listen, is there a--is there a car rental
place anywhere nearby?

696
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:53,885
- Uh...
- Huh?

697
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,136
- Rental car.
- Rental car?

698
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,388
- Hmm.
- Car rental?

699
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,516
- Hmm.
- A place where I can rent a car.

700
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,726
I know what it is.
I was just thinking.

701
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,811
I'm sorry.

702
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,688
Hmm. Mm-mm-mm.

703
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:08,483
Down in Emerson,
there's a car rental place.

704
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,693
Benny!

705
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,070
Uh, I think they're closed.

706
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:15,824
You can drive in the other direction,
you go down to Pachaqua.

707
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:18,410
I don't think they have
a car rental there.

708
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,329
- Let me think. I'm just thinking.
- Benny, come here!

709
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,622
I want to show you something!

710
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,958
- I--I--
- Jesus.

711
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,501
It'll come to me.

712
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,170
This is not a thriving metropolis,
I'll tell you that.

713
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,339
- There's a chicken place.
- you know what this is?

714
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:36,553
This is a 1936 Ford.
Deluxe, it was called.

715
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,638
Did you ever hear of Pachaqua?

716
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:42,183
No. You know when the last time
I saw one of these?

717
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,643
I was in college.

718
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:46,312
I'm talkin' fifty-something years ago.

719
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,065
I actually put down money
on a used one once--

720
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:52,110
$300, which was a fortune back then.

721
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:55,196
But my father,
he made me give it back.

722
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,866
How come?

723
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,326
You know, too flashy,
too much distraction.

724
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,911
Who knows?

725
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:05,790
What, you think you're the first one
who didn't understand his father?

726
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,210
But, boy, is this beautiful.

727
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,629
Look at that grill.

728
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,466
Is that gorgeous or what?

729
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,052
- You've got a good eye, sir!
- That's not a '36.

730
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,428
This is a '40! Am I right?!

731
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,722
That's right! A connoisseur, huh?

732
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:24,142
I restored it myself! Rides like a dream!

733
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,435
You don't say?

734
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,772
If you're interested, make me an offer.

735
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,863
I'm gonna do just that!

736
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,157
You're gonna do what?

737
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,077
I'm gonna buy me a Ford Deluxe.

738
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:43,787
You're gonna--You're gonna buy it?

739
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,208
Why not? Your car's all banged to shit.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

740
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,585
Excuse me! Do you take Visa?

741
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,587
Why--No, you can't just buy it!

742
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,798
You don't know anything about this car.

743
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:56,716
You don't--You don't know
how fast it goes.

744
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,178
What's the hurry? I got no place to be.
You got some place to be?

745
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,264
Don't you think we should get home
and see what's going on?

746
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:07,018
See what? Your sisters are there.
They can make phone calls without you.

747
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,397
I have work.

748
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,650
Hey, you're the one
that wants to go write in the country.

749
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,443
How much more country do you need?

750
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:19,406
Your mother,
she ran off to God knows where.

751
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:21,282
Your father's inconsolable.

752
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:23,827
So console me. Am I asking a lot?

753
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,454
- No, it's not that. It's just--
- So call home.

754
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:30,166
You'll tell 'em you'll be back
as soon as your old man finds himself.

755
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,293
If you want, we could find you, too.

756
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,796
We could look for
the whole goddamn family.

757
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,883
It makes no difference to me.
I got a car.

758
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,177
So, what do you--what do you suggest?

759
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:44,305
We make a trip. You and me.

760
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:49,811
You want to check with your wife?

761
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,689
I don't have to check with my wife.

762
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,065
So?

763
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,234
So?

764
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,990
OK, buy the car.

765
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,629
Oh, yeah. This car rides like a dream.

766
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,256
Mmm.

767
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,133
You smell that leather?

768
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,343
I do.

769
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,636
You see, it still has the old smell.

770
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,971
Why that is, I don't know.

771
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:29,684
You would think, fifty years,
it would lose the smell, but there it is--

772
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:33,813
that good Ford smell.

773
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:36,649
You know,
he was a big anti-Semite, Ford.

774
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,109
You've mentioned this, yes.

775
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,653
Yeah, but he made some beautiful cars.

776
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:42,072
Yes, he did.

777
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,035
You know,
your mother hates the way I drive.

778
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:48,370
I know, I know.

779
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:51,414
''You're driving too fast,''
''There's a curb there.''

780
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,541
- I understand. Hey, listen.
- ''That was a stop sign.''

781
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,210
OK, hey, believe me,
I've driven with you two.

782
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:56,252
It's not a picnic, by the way.

783
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:58,588
Now let me ask you. You're sitting there.

784
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,591
- What?
- Am I such a terrible driver?

785
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,301
No, you're not. Look at the road.

786
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:04,636
Thank you.

787
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,348
Oh, I love this car.

788
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:12,644
The first one of these I saw,
this kid at school had one.

789
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:18,358
Went out with this gorgeous girl,
Marion Savara.

790
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,902
Her name I remember.

791
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,947
- My God, what a knockout.
- Yeah?

792
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,951
He would pull up in this big shiny car,
open her door...

793
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:30,787
and out would come these legs.

794
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,456
- Marion Savara.
- Marion Savara.

795
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:36,751
I danced with her once.

796
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,503
That was about it.

797
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,588
You know why?
You didn't have this car then.

798
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,092
You're exactly right.
You see, everybody's got something.

799
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,511
Your mother never got
to the World's Fair.

800
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,597
I never got a shot at Marion Savara.

801
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,974
What are you going to do?

802
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,517
What are you going to do?

803
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:00,692
Look at us.

804
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:04,446
Wherever we want,
whenever we want, huh?

805
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,488
Ha ha ha.

806
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:11,494
Did you ever do this with your dad?

807
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:13,329
My dad? Never.

808
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:15,331
- No?
- No, no, no, no.

809
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:19,461
My dad worked.
That's all he knew--work.

810
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:22,255
- And did you resent that?
- Oh, here we go.

811
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,382
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I wasn't saying anything.

812
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,759
Resent him?
What do you mean, resent?

813
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,303
No, I didn't resent him.
That's the way it was.

814
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,388
- He was my father.
- Yeah, I know.

815
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:31,973
Why? Do you resent me?

816
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,516
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

817
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,644
Because, you know,
we never did this before today, either.

818
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:38,688
No, I know. Of course. I just...

819
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:42,650
It's just something I think about
all the time now with my kids.

820
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,527
They're growing up,
and I'm always thinking...

821
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:47,781
you know,
what are they going to remember?

822
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,199
Are we going to take them places--

823
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,285
Are we going to do things
that they wished we didn't do...

824
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,579
or are there going to be things
we didn't do...

825
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:58,083
that they're going to grow up and say,
''Hey, how come we never did that?''

826
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,794
You know?

827
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:03,838
Is this what you do in therapy?

828
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,132
No, no, no, no. It's--None of it--

829
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:07,717
What is it that we didn't do?

830
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,636
- Who?
- Me...with you and the girls.

831
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,638
- No, you--
- What did we forget to do?

832
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:14,557
- No, nothing. We didn't forget.
- No, I'm curious.

833
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,352
I don't know. We...
We never went camping.

834
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:19,229
Camping?
Who the hell goes camping?

835
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:21,564
Sleep outside and crap in a bush?

836
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,817
All right, well, then
we'll forget about that.

837
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,527
Oh, sorry. I thought--No.

838
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,737
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just--

839
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,572
- I wasn't making a joke.
- It's not important.

840
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,449
You always picture
fathers and sons, right?

841
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,535
That's the thing you're supposed to do.

842
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:37,622
You go camping together
and fishing at the fishing hole.

843
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,375
OK. Come on.

844
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,751
What are--What are you doing?

845
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,253
What are you doing?

846
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:46,297
I don't want you to resent
we never fished.

847
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:57,684
- Here.
- No, that's part of the feather.

848
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,310
- What?
- That's decoration.

849
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,604
Mmm, I think you're wrong.

850
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,981
- Oh.
- See? It dangles down.

851
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:06,276
Oh, my God. You know,
there's a lot of pockets here.

852
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,319
- Here.
- OK, now look.

853
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:09,446
You see? It goes right there.

854
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:10,572
- There?
- Yeah.

855
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,615
- Right--Right there?
- Yes.

856
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:15,118
- That's not the hole.
- What do you mean, it's not the hole?

857
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,202
- There's got to be a thing where you...
- Yes, it is.

858
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:17,412
- Of course.
- Wait a minute.

859
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:18,705
Where does the worm go?

860
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:20,874
There's no worms.
This is instead of worms.

861
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,125
They forgot the worms?

862
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,960
They didn't forget.
This is better than worms.

863
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,254
Worms is the old--
This is what they do now.

864
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:27,505
Oh, no worms.

865
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:30,133
Yeah. Remember the guy told us?
You almost never use worms.

866
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:32,761
- How about this here? That's big.
- Oh?

867
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:34,888
The bigger the thing,
the bigger the fish, no?

868
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,223
Hmm?
What if a little fish swallows it?

869
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,893
- It could choke. See? I--
- Wait. Does a fish smell?

870
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:43,605
They don't smell it, they see it.
How could they smell under the water?

871
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,482
I don't know.

872
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:47,817
The--Under the water don't smell?

873
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,986
What? Here, hold this.

874
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,696
Uh-huh.

875
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,448
All right.

876
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:55,116
- See, I just got--
- Oh, boy.

877
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,618
No, no, no. I just got to put--Ow.

878
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:59,287
- Oh, boy.
- All right, hold on.

879
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:00,538
- Oh, boy.
- OK.

880
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:41,329
Anything?

881
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,373
- Nothing.
- All right.

882
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:46,001
So, this is what it is.

883
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,045
- I guess.
- Yeah.

884
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:55,969
- Oh, my God.
- What?

885
00:43:56,052 --> 00:43:58,930
I think you just shot the first three bars
of "Moonlight in Vermont" there.

886
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,390
There's nobody here.

887
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:02,308
Who am I bothering?

888
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,566
How are your toes?

889
00:44:09,607 --> 00:44:11,609
Not bad.

890
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,449
Oh, I think I actually
got something here.

891
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:18,616
Hold him up. Hold still.

892
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,909
- Huh?
- Hold still.

893
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,870
What--What are you doing?

894
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:24,164
- He's still alive.
- Of course he's still alive.

895
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:25,248
I just pulled him out of--
What are you hitting him for?

896
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,416
I'm not hitting him.

897
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,084
Yeah, you just smacked--
Why would you hit a fish?

898
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,586
Poor thing can't breathe.

899
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:30,754
Oh, what, and you think hitting him's
going to help him?

900
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:33,340
- Give me the thing. Give me the thing.
- Don't--Don't hit him.

901
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,884
- Don't--Don't hurt it.
- I'll let him catch his breath a little.

902
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:37,093
- What?
- Not his breath...

903
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,179
but you know what I mean.

904
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:41,723
Yeah, little fishy. You want to go, huh?

905
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,767
You want to go? Go ahead.

906
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,393
We were just kidding.

907
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:55,070
- You had enough fishing?
- I could be done.

908
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:42,367
Huh? Yeah, he's--he's all right, actually.

909
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,702
I'm better than all right.

910
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,954
This is the best I've been
since I don't know when.

911
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,872
Your mother
should leave me more often.

912
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,082
Mom should leave him
more often, he said.

913
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:51,793
Why do you keep saying
what I'm saying? Let me talk.

914
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:54,754
All right, he wants to talk to you.
I don't know.

915
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,214
Hello, sweetheart.

916
00:45:56,297 --> 00:46:00,301
Listen, if your husband doesn't
check in every 45 minutes...

917
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:03,805
you won't be beside yourself
with worry.

918
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:06,266
I agree with you 100%.

919
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:09,519
Ha ha ha. All right. Bye-bye.

920
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:10,895
And what?

921
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:12,856
She's a very sweet girl, your wife.

922
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,983
Agree what?
What'd she just say to you?

923
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,360
She said you can be
quite a pain in the ass...

924
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:19,904
and I shouldn't take it personal.

925
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:21,322
So sweet.

926
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:38,548
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Listen to you.

927
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,092
Now, the point is,
if a person is determined...

928
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,345
to be unhappy
and angry their whole life...

929
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:45,722
then you know what?
That's their problem.

930
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:48,183
- Jeez, Pop.
- What?

931
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:51,394
So, if Mom was unhappy,
you didn't care?

932
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,396
I never said I didn't care.

933
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,523
You just said, if she's unhappy,
that's her problem.

934
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,693
- That's her problem, that's right.
- OK.

935
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:01,488
- What? So I'm the schmuck?
- No, but--

936
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:04,366
No, it's my fault.
She's unhappy because of me, right?

937
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:06,284
- No, I didn't say that.
- Well, that's what you think.

938
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,036
- No. No, I'm not saying that.
- Yes, it is.

939
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:09,746
- Come on, that's what you think.
- No, but I--

940
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:12,874
Well, I'm going to tell you something now
that I never said before.

941
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:16,544
I think she was unhappy already
when I met her.

942
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,213
That's right.

943
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:20,882
And all the time before that,
growing up.

944
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:23,593
I think she was an unhappy girl.

945
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:26,054
Remember her father?

946
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:28,431
- No. He--He was--He died.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

947
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:32,560
Yeah. Well, he was
a real sourpuss of a guy.

948
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:34,813
Nice enough, but a sourpuss.

949
00:47:34,896 --> 00:47:36,856
And your grandmother, well...

950
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,818
she wasn't the cheeriest person
in the world, either.

951
00:47:39,901 --> 00:47:42,237
I'm not saying
they didn't have problems...

952
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:47,075
but it was not a happy house.

953
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:50,120
And your mother, by the time
she set out into the world...

954
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:53,915
she already had this, I don't know...

955
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:58,962
I just never got the impression
she was ever happy.

956
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:06,511
Well, maybe that explains...

957
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:08,847
why she wanted so much
to be happy with you.

958
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,599
- OK. OK.
- Huh?

959
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:13,143
But, listen.

960
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:14,978
I was in the same marriage...

961
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,439
and I was happy.

962
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,566
Yes, you were happy,
but that's the point.

963
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:20,942
Well, the point is, see...

964
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:22,694
if you had made just, like,
a little more of an effort--

965
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:24,946
Oh, peaches.

966
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:31,494
Oh, my God. That's a peach.

967
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:33,371
You're really not going to try one?

968
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:35,165
Can't. Allergic.

969
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:36,750
Still?

970
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:39,836
So juicy and sweet.

971
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:41,004
What do they do to them?

972
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:42,964
Nothing.
They just picked it, so it's fresh.

973
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,049
Is that what it is?

974
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:45,967
Excuse me!

975
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:49,679
- This peach came off that tree?
- Uh-huh.

976
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,097
How do you like that?

977
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:53,975
They picked it there,
they put it in a bushel.

978
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,353
Bang! We're eating peaches.

979
00:48:56,394 --> 00:49:00,482
No middleman, no messing around.
Fantastic.

980
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:03,568
- How can you still be allergic?
- How? I don't know.

981
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,570
- Try it!
- I wish I could. It makes my ears itch.

982
00:49:05,653 --> 00:49:07,322
When's the last time you tried it?

983
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:09,699
- 1972.
- Oh, for God's sake.

984
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:12,160
People outgrow allergies, you know.
Try it.

985
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:13,203
- Nah.
- One bite!

986
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:15,705
- I'm afraid I'll get that--
- You don't know what you're missing.

987
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:16,998
- Try it.
- I--

988
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,459
Here, here. Take a bite.

989
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,503
Go ahead.

990
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:23,505
- Oh, my God.
- You see what I'm saying?

991
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:26,675
Live a little.
It's fresh. They just picked it.

992
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:28,718
Boy, that's good.

993
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,303
You see, if your mother were here,
she'd say...

994
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,972
''Sam, you've had enough.
Two peaches are plenty.''

995
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:34,557
But you know what?

996
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,351
I'm having another one.

997
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,061
What do you think of that?

998
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,566
Really, I wouldn't have believed it.

999
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,777
How can you have allergies?

1000
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,531
Nobody has allergies
when I'm the father.

1001
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:52,283
I don't have 'em.
Your sisters don't have 'em.

1002
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:58,039
All right, all right.

1003
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:01,584
No need to get snippy.

1004
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:04,379
Here we go.
''For relief of watery eyes...

1005
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,673
scratchy throat,
and other hay fever symptoms.''

1006
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:08,174
But your eyes,
they aren't watery, are they?

1007
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:09,801
It's all right. I'll be fine.

1008
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:10,969
I wouldn't have believed it.

1009
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:14,806
Have you ever heard of a grown man
allergic to a peach?

1010
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:17,517
- You folks from around here?
- Nah, just passing through.

1011
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,061
- Business?
- Uh, business? No. Pleasure.

1012
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:22,230
You know, a little fishing.

1013
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,232
Hey, you folks want free tickets
to the big game?

1014
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,400
What game?

1015
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:37,954
It's a beautiful day,
so what do you say?

1016
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:39,956
Let's play some ball.

1017
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:42,625
These are the best seats
I've ever had for anything.

1018
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,628
Batting next for the Saw Bellies...

1019
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:50,300
number 22,
Ramon Espencela.

1020
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,594
Ramon Espencela.

1021
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:55,972
- Yeah, now, there's a name for you.
- Ramon!

1022
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:57,807
What?

1023
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:02,395
Sorry. No.
I wasn't talking to you, I was just...

1024
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:05,648
Go--Go ahead. Sorry.

1025
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:07,650
This is a very small stadium.

1026
00:51:10,987 --> 00:51:14,491
- And don't forget, folks...
- Oop. Oop. OK.

1027
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:16,242
- Go, Saw Bellies!
- Yes.

1028
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:21,581
Go, Saw Bellies.

1029
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:24,459
- Explain that to me.
- What?

1030
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:27,170
- The holes in those jeans.
- Uh-huh.

1031
00:51:27,253 --> 00:51:29,381
- They're on purpose?
- That's right.

1032
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:31,966
- It's not because she's poor...
- Mm-mmm.

1033
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:33,343
and can only afford ripped clothing.

1034
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:35,345
That's correct, sir.

1035
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:39,724
And she doesn't mind that we can
see her ass peeking out like that?

1036
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:41,518
No, she does not. In fact...

1037
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:43,937
I think she would be insulted
if you didn't look.

1038
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,982
The last thing I want to do is insult.

1039
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:54,989
Top of the fifteenth inning,
still scoreless.

1040
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:00,203
- Short pop fly...
- Run it out!

1041
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:01,996
Come on, run it out!

1042
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:04,040
Oh, come on!
A little hustle on the bases!

1043
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:07,002
I say always run it out.
You never know.

1044
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:09,421
You are right. Do you boys
want a coke or something?

1045
00:52:09,504 --> 00:52:11,798
- No, no. We're good, thanks.
- No, thanks.

1046
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:14,259
- You sure?
- Yeah, but thank you very much.

1047
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:15,635
Yes, that's all right, too.

1048
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:18,930
Boy.

1049
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:22,809
Boy, she almost took an eye out
with those things.

1050
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:26,146
Ha ha. How old is a girl like that?

1051
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:28,565
I don't know--23, 24.

1052
00:52:28,606 --> 00:52:29,774
What, are you interested?

1053
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,234
No, I just can't tell anymore.

1054
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:35,655
You reach a certain age,
you can't tell how old young people are.

1055
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,949
If you said she was twelve,
I'd have believed you.

1056
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,868
She's not twelve.

1057
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:41,036
I can't tell.

1058
00:52:41,077 --> 00:52:42,912
Yeah.
All right, but you're still looking.

1059
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:44,748
That's good.
I'm glad to see you're still looking.

1060
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:48,126
You can always look.
Listen, you could be a diabetic.

1061
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:52,881
You see a cake, you can still go,
''That's a nice cake.

1062
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:55,342
Look how nice,
the frosting around the edge.''

1063
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:58,219
The frosting on the bottom.
You like that.

1064
00:52:58,261 --> 00:53:00,096
There's a hot grounder.

1065
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,598
Yeah.

1066
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:03,933
Beautiful! Yeah!

1067
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:05,435
Go! Whoo!

1068
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:06,936
There he goes!

1069
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,563
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

1070
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:11,483
Yay! 47!

1071
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:12,734
- Yeah!
- Beautiful.

1072
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,194
- Who's 47?
- 47.

1073
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:16,237
47 is Albanis.

1074
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:18,281
Albanis! Beautiful, baby!

1075
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,574
All right, Albanis!

1076
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:20,617
And just a reminder...

1077
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:23,787
this Friday night is kiddies' night
at Baby's Steak and Claw.

1078
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,581
I have to ask.
Are you two father and son?

1079
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,500
Well, how do you know
we're not brothers?

1080
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,835
Well, I just think
you two are so sweet.

1081
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,963
- Ah, you're nice.
- Well, good luck to you.

1082
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,256
Ooh.

1083
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:40,470
OK, she's not twelve.

1084
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:45,016
You play the Fender,
and I'll play the toms...

1085
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,894
OK, so you're young,
you're attracted to each other...

1086
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,688
but, like, when did it get romantic...

1087
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:52,774
Romantic? Who, with Ma?

1088
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:55,318
No, the girl with the tits.
Yes, with Ma.

1089
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,321
When did you start, like, going out?

1090
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,448
I don't know if we did.

1091
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:02,450
Somebody did something.

1092
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:05,829
All right, let me think. Uh...

1093
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:08,540
Gee, I don't remember.

1094
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:13,837
I used to drive her home sometimes,
because she lived not too far from me.

1095
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,714
She told me the first time
you ever kissed...

1096
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:16,840
was in the car dropping her off.

1097
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:20,385
Oh, she did?
Well, then she must be right.

1098
00:54:20,468 --> 00:54:25,098
Yeah, but she--So, OK.
So, what happens after that?

1099
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:27,225
So, you--
What, you're dropping her off...

1100
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:28,893
and you're making out in the car,
whatever.

1101
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,103
Yeah.

1102
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:32,147
So, did you guys sleep together
before you were married?

1103
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:34,274
- Hey!
- What? That's too far. I went too far.

1104
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:35,483
- I'm your father.
- All right.

1105
00:54:35,525 --> 00:54:39,779
- Hey, you don't ask things like that.
- But, hey, you weren't my father then.

1106
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:41,573
See, at that point,
you're just a young guy...

1107
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:43,450
so I'm asking you as a guy.

1108
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:46,286
- As a guy?
- That's all. As a guy.

1109
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:48,371
Well, let me think about that.

1110
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:51,166
Um...hmm.

1111
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:55,670
The first time that
I ever slept with your mother...

1112
00:54:55,712 --> 00:55:01,009
was in a hotel
on Lexington Avenue after work.

1113
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:02,677
A hotel?

1114
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:06,264
The Thorgeson--55th and Lex.

1115
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:08,016
Gone now.

1116
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:09,976
Really?

1117
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,187
So--So--So...

1118
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,856
After work, and you just get a room,
and then, like that?

1119
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:19,152
Well, you--you got to start somewhere.

1120
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:21,071
Jeez.

1121
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,572
What's the matter?

1122
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:24,157
No, that's just...

1123
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,659
Nothing.
It's just not how I ever pictured it.

1124
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,661
Not that I ever pictured it.

1125
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:33,875
Oh, yeah.
It was a nice hotel--all quiet.

1126
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:36,753
And we had a little wine...

1127
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:40,215
and we had a little music on the radio.

1128
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:43,593
And your mother, she had a little...

1129
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,303
Well, it was like a nightie--

1130
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:48,640
pink, silky...

1131
00:55:48,723 --> 00:55:50,558
little strings up here.

1132
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,105
Short, but, you know, not too short--

1133
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:59,317
like, uh, mid-thigh.

1134
00:56:03,571 --> 00:56:06,157
See, I can't tell
if you're bullshitting me or not.

1135
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:09,452
Of course you can't.
That's the whole purpose of bullshit.

1136
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:15,291
Baby, whoa, baby

1137
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,836
Let's boogaloo
down Broad, Broadway

1138
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,921
Yeah, funky Broadway

1139
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:22,424
Baby, oh, baby

1140
00:56:22,465 --> 00:56:25,343
Let's boogaloo
down Broad, Broadway

1141
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:26,511
Yeah, funky Broadway

1142
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:29,556
- Ah, that feels better.
- Yeah.

1143
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:31,766
Oh, God.

1144
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:34,394
We're gonna boogaloo

1145
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:36,688
- Ohh.
- What's the matter?

1146
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:39,399
I think they got this carpeting from us.

1147
00:56:39,482 --> 00:56:41,901
- What?
- How do you like that?

1148
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:45,405
Fiesta cranberry, it's called.
Couldn't keep it in stock.

1149
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:47,615
That's how popular it was.

1150
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:51,119
OK, don't--don't do that.

1151
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,162
Baby

1152
00:56:52,203 --> 00:56:53,788
What? You don't listen to me.

1153
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,458
Hey, you guys are up.

1154
00:56:56,499 --> 00:56:58,835
Oh, no, we weren't waiting.
I was just watching.

1155
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:00,837
- Let's play.
- What?

1156
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,381
- Let's play a little.
- What, are you kidding?

1157
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:04,883
I've never seen you play pool
in my whole life.

1158
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:07,886
No, but before you,
I could play pretty good.

1159
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:10,972
You want to rack them up?

1160
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,099
Yeah.

1161
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:19,689
And that's not playing
in forty-whatever years.

1162
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:23,360
Well, now, court is in session, baby

1163
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:26,571
And my heart is the one on trial

1164
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:31,076
Ah, court is in session, baby

1165
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:32,494
Hey, good.

1166
00:57:32,535 --> 00:57:33,536
And my heart is the one on trial

1167
00:57:33,578 --> 00:57:36,081
There we go.
There you go, Sparky.

1168
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,625
- Me? No. I don't drink beer.
- Try one.

1169
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:40,085
- No. The bubbles.
- Hey.

1170
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:41,252
They go up.

1171
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:43,630
Hey, I ate the frickin' peach.

1172
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:46,216
Huh?

1173
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:48,635
Can you deliver me
a verdict?

1174
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:50,387
Not so terrible.

1175
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,889
Oh, for God's sake.

1176
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:54,182
I got no more other time

1177
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:55,934
Anyone feel like
playing for money?

1178
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:59,229
No, no, no. We're not here
to play for monetary gain.

1179
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:01,690
Nothing fancy. 10 bucks a game.

1180
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:05,276
Kind offer, indeed, but I'm afraid
our evening has come to a close.

1181
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,736
25 bucks a game?

1182
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:09,739
Humble travelers are we
who've come from afar...

1183
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:10,782
50 bucks.

1184
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:13,159
to but pass through
your gracious village.

1185
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:16,037
- 100 bucks a game.
- 100 bucks it is.

1186
00:58:17,747 --> 00:58:19,666
What are you doing? What are you doing?
You're playing for money now?

1187
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:21,668
Not my money, his money.

1188
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:30,385
Well, I just got back
to the city

1189
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:33,847
I left
my country man behind

1190
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:34,889
Don't give me
too many chances.

1191
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,434
I'm ready, willing, and able

1192
00:58:37,475 --> 00:58:40,937
To give the city boys
all of my time

1193
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,148
I got a whole lot
of brand new tricks

1194
00:58:43,231 --> 00:58:44,774
I'll give you that one.
I'm giving it to you.

1195
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:47,318
Had a ball
back from the sticks

1196
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:50,822
I wanna show you
what I learned

1197
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:54,492
From the old-time
country hicks

1198
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:57,454
I learned
a new kind of mambo

1199
00:58:57,537 --> 00:59:00,123
Oh!

1200
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:01,666
Can I trouble you
for a cigarette?

1201
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,588
I left mine in a poplin
zip-up jacket in 1961.

1202
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:09,549
I learned
a new kind of mambo

1203
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:13,636
And it just can't miss

1204
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,931
They really did
that mambo right

1205
00:59:16,973 --> 00:59:19,184
'Cause they held me
good and tight

1206
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:20,477
Oh, yeah.

1207
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,644
I could do
that mambo now

1208
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:23,146
That's better.

1209
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:25,857
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just one cigarette.

1210
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,317
You should not be
having a cig--

1211
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,401
What--No, don't--

1212
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:30,445
And if Dr. Schneiderman
hears about this...

1213
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,864
I'm going to rip you a new one.

1214
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:37,911
Aw, that's a shame.
You hate to see that.

1215
00:59:37,994 --> 00:59:39,579
And it just can't miss

1216
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:41,081
It's a heartbreak.

1217
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:44,167
Hmm, mambo

1218
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,502
And it just can't miss

1219
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:47,379
It's all coming back to me.

1220
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,547
Oh, yeah.

1221
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,261
Oh, yeah.

1222
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:04,437
Rack 'em up.
Don't just stand there.

1223
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:10,694
- Oy!
- Whoo!

1224
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:15,824
This guy's the real deal.

1225
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:27,043
Ha ha ha ha!

1226
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:30,588
Now, every woman
wants a man

1227
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,716
A man who keeps his cool

1228
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,384
7 ball...

1229
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:36,886
down the hall.

1230
01:00:36,928 --> 01:00:37,929
Oh!

1231
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:39,472
Number 3...

1232
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:40,724
out to sea.

1233
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,726
Silly actin' fool

1234
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,936
Number 9...

1235
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,688
down the line.

1236
01:00:46,771 --> 01:00:48,606
So move it, move it slow

1237
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,483
But when it comes to lovin'...

1238
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:53,111
Number 8! Yeah!

1239
01:00:53,194 --> 01:00:54,320
Let's turn the heat up, baby

1240
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:55,822
Number 8...

1241
01:00:55,905 --> 01:00:57,949
shut the gate.

1242
01:00:58,033 --> 01:00:58,992
Wow.

1243
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:01,536
Way to go, man.

1244
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:03,955
Whoo!

1245
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,331
Well, thank you
very much there.

1246
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:09,419
That was quite exhilarating,
but I believe that, uh...

1247
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:11,921
my work in this town...

1248
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,089
is done.

1249
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:14,382
Ha ha. Way to go, man.

1250
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,426
What did we decide on,
$100 a game?

1251
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:18,386
I believe it was,
yes--100 bucks.

1252
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:21,222
I don't remember that.

1253
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:23,099
No?

1254
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:26,561
I believe my attorney
here is correct.

1255
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:30,190
I think you might be mistaken.

1256
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:33,401
But, hey...

1257
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:35,904
you played really great, pops.

1258
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:36,946
OK, hey.

1259
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,908
Hey! Come on!
Come on, fellas.

1260
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:44,913
Now, you see, that's exactly
the reason I gave up pool.

1261
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:46,664
- What?
- The fights.

1262
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:47,957
There's no fight.

1263
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,751
Sure there is. Look.

1264
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:51,169
Uhh!

1265
01:01:52,962 --> 01:01:54,172
- Whoa!
- Uhh!

1266
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:55,256
Whoa!

1267
01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:59,052
Proud to be an American

1268
01:01:59,135 --> 01:02:01,221
Part of a great democracy

1269
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:02,764
Calm down, calm down.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

1270
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:04,224
Get off me.

1271
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:05,767
Come on. Get off of me.

1272
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:07,102
Get off me!

1273
01:02:07,143 --> 01:02:09,270
It's all right.
Nothing to see here, folks.

1274
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:12,607
Everything's under control.

1275
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:15,819
Just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

1276
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:16,861
- Ooh!
- Oh! Oh!

1277
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:18,613
You know,
you make a deal...

1278
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:20,824
you should honor it
like a gentleman.

1279
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:23,743
Don't you think? Now, personally,
I don't care about the money.

1280
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,413
In fact, I'd like you
to give it to the proprietor...

1281
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:28,289
to make up for this ugly display.

1282
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:30,333
All I want from you...

1283
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:33,211
is an honest
and sincere apology.

1284
01:02:33,294 --> 01:02:35,422
Eat shit and die.

1285
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:37,632
Oh, my God.

1286
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:40,301
You know, you say
something like that...

1287
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:42,929
and that makes me say this.

1288
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,055
- Oh!
- Ahh!

1289
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:46,141
Oh!

1290
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,644
What did I do?
I got you both?

1291
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:52,063
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

1292
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:56,693
I--I thought for sure
I would've cleared you.

1293
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:00,363
- Ahh.
- Boy...

1294
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,032
Yeah. I'm OK. I'm OK.

1295
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:05,035
Boy, that's some shot
I gave him.

1296
01:03:05,076 --> 01:03:06,369
Yes.

1297
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,747
I must've been all pent up.

1298
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:13,335
Well, to be perfectly frank,
I must've been pent up from before.

1299
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:17,005
You know,
your mother and everything.

1300
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:20,050
What? What are you
laughing at?

1301
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:22,093
That's what you do in therapy.

1302
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:25,055
Well, I got to say,
I'm feeling a little better.

1303
01:03:25,096 --> 01:03:27,724
Yeah, well,
I'm very happy for you.

1304
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:29,392
Hey.

1305
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:32,562
Well, look who's here.

1306
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:34,022
Nice to see you again.

1307
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:37,400
I heard there were two city boys
tearing up our town.

1308
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,527
That's us.

1309
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:40,987
These are the guys
I was telling you about.

1310
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:42,572
This is my mother.

1311
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:44,240
Well, hello.

1312
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:47,327
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Sam Kleinman.

1313
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,996
We were hoping that we could
buy you two a cocktail...

1314
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,207
make up for the behavior
of our few rotten apples.

1315
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:53,750
No, no. No, no, no, no.

1316
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:57,087
No, that's--that would be sweet of you,
but not necessary at all.

1317
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,755
You are not allowed to refuse.

1318
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:00,757
It's the law.

1319
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,092
Huh? It's the law.

1320
01:04:02,175 --> 01:04:04,594
The law is the law. Go.

1321
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,430
Whoo!

1322
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:14,312
Spent $48 last night
at the county fair

1323
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:19,484
I throwed out my shoulder

1324
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:22,445
But I won her that teddy bear

1325
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:28,785
She's got me sayin' sugar pie,
honey, darlin', and dear

1326
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:33,373
I ain't seen the Braves
play a game all year

1327
01:04:33,456 --> 01:04:36,793
Gonna get fired
if I don't get some sleep

1328
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:40,171
My long lost buddies say
I'm gettin' in too deep

1329
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,340
But I like it, I love it

1330
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,509
I want some more of it

1331
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:46,594
I try so hard

1332
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:48,513
I can't rise above it

1333
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:50,015
Don't know what it is

1334
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:52,017
'Bout that little gal's lovin'

1335
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,102
But I like it, I love it

1336
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:56,479
I want some more of it

1337
01:05:13,788 --> 01:05:15,874
See, my husband was the same--
travel, work, work, travel...

1338
01:05:15,957 --> 01:05:17,625
and then one day I realized...

1339
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:20,670
you know, OK, I'm just going to have
to make my own amusement.

1340
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:23,715
So, that's when I started
my correspondence courses...

1341
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:25,300
and I started my gardening.

1342
01:05:25,383 --> 01:05:28,845
See, that's healthy to me.
I mean, that I understand.

1343
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:30,430
Yeah, you should see
her tomatoes and zucchinis.

1344
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:32,766
They're, like, freaky big.

1345
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:35,268
My mom--I remember once,
I was over the house--

1346
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:36,686
Everything all right here,
gentlemen?

1347
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:37,771
We're good.

1348
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:38,855
And she was, like,
''Where is your father?

1349
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:40,648
''I've had dinner on
the table since 6:00.''

1350
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:43,318
I said, ''Ma,
he's never been home at 6:00...

1351
01:05:43,401 --> 01:05:45,945
''and he never will, you know,
so why don't you just accept it...

1352
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:47,864
''and spare yourself
all the heartache?

1353
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:49,616
''I mean, just make your life
a little easier.''

1354
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:51,785
- You know what she says?
- What?

1355
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:54,287
''Because I like to think
there's always hope.''

1356
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:58,667
Yeah. OK. So now you see
what I was dealing with.

1357
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:00,210
''There's always hope.''

1358
01:06:00,293 --> 01:06:03,254
Right. So let me ask you.
Who's crazy?

1359
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:04,839
- Nobody's crazy.
- No?

1360
01:06:04,881 --> 01:06:06,216
- No.
- After all those years...

1361
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:08,718
she's still waiting for me
to be different?

1362
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:11,429
I mean, I've been exactly the same
the whole time.

1363
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:14,891
I'm not pulling any surprises,
but still she's surprised.

1364
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:17,894
I know, and that's
what breaks my heart.

1365
01:06:17,977 --> 01:06:20,063
- What?
- Because she's hope--

1366
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:23,525
I mean, all--I don't know.
Aren't we supposed to have hope?

1367
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:26,403
Isn't that what sustains us?

1368
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:29,406
Isn't that what keeps mankind
going forward?

1369
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,658
This is a perfect medium-rare.

1370
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:32,742
Pop, I'm asking--

1371
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:35,120
What? Mankind, you said.

1372
01:06:35,203 --> 01:06:38,998
OK. All right. People hope
for world peace, right?

1373
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,376
Now, do they really think
it's gonna work out?

1374
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:44,671
No, probably not, but they still--
they keep praying, right?

1375
01:06:44,754 --> 01:06:45,922
They keep hoping.

1376
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:48,008
Yeah, but I'm not world peace,
I'm her husband.

1377
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,926
And one person
could never be...

1378
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,554
exactly what another person
expects them to be.

1379
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:55,724
Because it's not reasonable.
Am I right or wrong?

1380
01:06:55,765 --> 01:06:58,768
- Yes, but still--
- This is fantastic.

1381
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:00,520
Here, taste this.
Come on, you got--

1382
01:07:00,603 --> 01:07:02,939
- I have the same thing.
- Never mind. Taste mine.

1383
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:05,525
- I have the exact--
- This is out of this world!

1384
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:07,152
Huh?

1385
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:09,237
It's exactly the same that I have.

1386
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,406
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go...

1387
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,408
Oh. Sure. Yeah, yeah.

1388
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,909
Oh, yeah.

1389
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:18,413
So, let me ask you--you married
another woman, let's say...

1390
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:21,249
Mom married another guy, right?
So everything was different.

1391
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:22,792
What is it with you?

1392
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:25,879
- I'm just gonna go with her.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

1393
01:07:25,962 --> 01:07:27,589
What did we do?
We scared 'em away?

1394
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:28,923
What do you mean,
what is it with me?

1395
01:07:28,965 --> 01:07:30,759
What?
Finish your question. What?

1396
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,594
What is it that
you're so concerned...

1397
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:34,763
what happened between
your mother and me?

1398
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:36,431
What do you mean,
why am I so concerned?

1399
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:38,933
- That's the whole freakin' thing.
- What's the difference?

1400
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:42,103
That's the whole thing of my life.
That's the--that's the--

1401
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:44,356
that's the big white elephant
in our house.

1402
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:45,440
What was?

1403
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:47,400
The shit. All the shit
between you and Ma.

1404
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,861
- There was no shit.
- There was no shit?

1405
01:07:49,944 --> 01:07:50,945
Where was there shit?

1406
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:52,280
Everywhere you looked
there was shit.

1407
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:54,157
- Bullshit.
- Oh, come on.

1408
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,785
All right, we didn't talk about it,
but you don't think we saw it?

1409
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:59,954
You don't think we all saw the--
the finger-pointing...

1410
01:07:59,996 --> 01:08:01,373
and the rolling of the eyes?

1411
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,458
- Hey, I loved your mother.
- I know.

1412
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,418
- I still love your mother.
- I know.

1413
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:07,545
- And she loves me.
- Absolutely, yes.

1414
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:08,713
So, what are you saying?

1415
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:12,050
I'm saying,
look how much love was wasted.

1416
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:15,387
I mean, an abundance of love...

1417
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,972
quashed by a quagmire of shit.

1418
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,975
I'm opening my pants.

1419
01:08:21,017 --> 01:08:22,060
Go ahead.

1420
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,937
Oy.

1421
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:26,773
OK, so--

1422
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:29,067
OK, so let me
ask you something.

1423
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,652
You're such an expert.

1424
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:33,405
- You and your wife...
- Yeah?

1425
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:35,281
You don't have any shit?

1426
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:36,700
- Of course we do.
- Right.

1427
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:38,910
And you handle
all your shit perfect?

1428
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:41,913
No, not perfect, but I--

1429
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:43,415
What? You what?

1430
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:45,917
All right. Like this house
in the country?

1431
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:47,669
Do I need that? No.

1432
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:50,422
But it's important to her.

1433
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:53,425
So I'm, I--
I listen to her.

1434
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:57,429
So, really...
she should thank me, your wife.

1435
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:58,513
Hmm?

1436
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,557
If I didn't set
such a bad example...

1437
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,767
you wouldn't be knocking
yourself out for her.

1438
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:05,687
Well, I--you know, you're joking.
I don't know, maybe.

1439
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:07,105
I mean, a lot of times--

1440
01:09:07,188 --> 01:09:08,356
Any more sourdough bread
for you gentlemen?

1441
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,524
We're good.

1442
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:11,401
7-grain cheese rolls,
sesame onion bread sticks?

1443
01:09:11,484 --> 01:09:13,278
Nothing. No.
We're really fine.

1444
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:16,114
A lot of times it's just little stuff.

1445
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:18,533
I try to do little things.
You know...

1446
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:20,702
surprises or little presents...

1447
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:23,329
or I write her little cards.

1448
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:25,749
Which, you know--
See, you...

1449
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,751
you were never a big card guy.

1450
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:29,044
So shoot me.

1451
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:32,630
Hey, you asked me, ''Like what?''
So I'm telling you.

1452
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:35,216
Believe me, little cards,
little papers--

1453
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,344
whatever the hell
you're talking about--

1454
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:42,474
believe me, that would not miraculously
have made your mother happy.

1455
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:44,100
- Really?
- That's right.

1456
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:48,396
Whatever it is that she needed,
I didn't have it to give to her.

1457
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,566
OK. And when
she didn't get it from you...

1458
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:54,861
who do you think
she turned to next, huh?

1459
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,780
Who do you think
she turned to next?

1460
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:58,365
Who?

1461
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:00,283
- Me.
- You?

1462
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:01,785
Yeah. Well, all of us.

1463
01:10:01,826 --> 01:10:04,079
Really with me more
than the girls, even.

1464
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,246
Why? Because you're a boy?

1465
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,582
Yeah. Because--yeah.
I mean, some--

1466
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:09,125
What the hell
happened to them?

1467
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:11,252
Somebody had to make
her happy, right?

1468
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:14,506
Guess what? I tried.
Believe me, I tried.

1469
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:18,259
That cloud, that--
that veil of disappointment...

1470
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,428
I could never make it go away.

1471
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:23,098
I could never crack
that sadness there.

1472
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,266
So you know
what I'm talking about.

1473
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:26,810
Yes, I do.

1474
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:28,061
And I also know that...

1475
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:31,106
she wouldn't have needed anything
from me if she got it--

1476
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:33,566
- We also have a lovely--
- Walk away!

1477
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,068
Just walk away.

1478
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:37,612
She wouldn't have needed
anything from me...

1479
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,239
if she got it from you.

1480
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:40,824
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

1481
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:43,326
And I'm tired of feeling
like the fuckin' failure here...

1482
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:45,161
'cause I'm not the one
who failed her, you are.

1483
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:47,414
You are. You never cared.

1484
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:49,249
You just went about
your business...

1485
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:51,292
and, ''Oh, everything will
work out fine in the end.''

1486
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:54,629
But you know what? It doesn't.
It doesn't work like that.

1487
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:57,173
You have to--
you have to care.

1488
01:10:57,215 --> 01:11:00,301
You have to try
and give a shit. Huh?

1489
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:02,137
Look at that letter.

1490
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:06,725
I mean, she was screaming for you,
and you didn't hear it.

1491
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:08,268
And now you're surprised?

1492
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:10,103
Forty years later, your wife is--

1493
01:11:10,186 --> 01:11:12,313
God knows where she is--
trying to figure out...

1494
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:14,941
why her life didn't work out
like she planned...

1495
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:18,445
and you think that's got
nothing to do with you, huh?

1496
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:21,156
It's got everything
to do with you.

1497
01:11:21,197 --> 01:11:23,908
You didn't do your job.
That's right.

1498
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:26,327
You didn't do your job.

1499
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:50,977
Ohh!

1500
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,812
Uhh!

1501
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:00,612
Hey.

1502
01:12:06,242 --> 01:12:10,580
What a waste of a good steak.

1503
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:12,415
I'm an asshole.

1504
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:14,709
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

1505
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:16,252
Listen, I...

1506
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:18,421
I had no right saying all that.

1507
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:19,839
- No.
- No, no, I didn't.

1508
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:22,425
No, you're entitled.

1509
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:26,262
And I'm gonna tell you
something else.

1510
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:29,933
Maybe you're right.

1511
01:12:30,016 --> 01:12:34,270
Maybe I could've done better,
maybe I should've...

1512
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,398
but I didn't.

1513
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:38,483
So you know what?

1514
01:12:43,029 --> 01:12:44,989
I'm sorry.

1515
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:00,171
OK.

1516
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:34,122
You think the girls
are worried about us?

1517
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:36,458
I think they'll be all right.

1518
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:38,960
Unh. Do you know...

1519
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:42,797
that was the first time
since Roosevelt died...

1520
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:46,968
that I danced with someone
besides your mother?

1521
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,470
And?

1522
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:51,639
I didn't like it. It felt wrong--

1523
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:53,975
wrong skin, wrong smell.

1524
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:56,644
The height, her hands.

1525
01:13:56,686 --> 01:13:58,980
Didn't feel right.

1526
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:06,571
Oh, what's she doing, Benny?

1527
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,743
She's gonna live by herself?

1528
01:14:11,826 --> 01:14:15,955
She's gonna find someone else
she likes better?

1529
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:18,625
Now?

1530
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:25,298
You know, we're not kids anymore,
your mother and me.

1531
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:29,511
You want to change your life,
do it when you're young.

1532
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:31,930
Ugh! I don't know.

1533
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:36,101
I don't know what she wants.
I don't know what I did.

1534
01:14:36,184 --> 01:14:37,769
I don't know anything.

1535
01:14:37,852 --> 01:14:42,941
Ahh, unh!

1536
01:14:43,024 --> 01:14:47,112
Are your stars moving around
all cock-eyed?

1537
01:14:47,195 --> 01:14:48,613
Yep.

1538
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:50,782
Me, too.

1539
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:53,785
Oh, you're a bad influence,
sonny boy.

1540
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:55,954
You made your old man drunk.

1541
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:59,290
Well...sorry.

1542
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:01,501
What's that?

1543
01:15:03,044 --> 01:15:04,671
The Big Dipper?

1544
01:15:04,754 --> 01:15:07,048
Where are you looking?
What, here?

1545
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,216
Over here.

1546
01:15:08,299 --> 01:15:09,426
- This one?
- Yeah.

1547
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:13,596
Uh...

1548
01:15:13,638 --> 01:15:15,098
I don't know.

1549
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,684
All right.

1550
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:19,227
Unh!

1551
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:22,772
This is what I want.

1552
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:26,276
Everyone's worried
about your mother...

1553
01:15:26,317 --> 01:15:27,777
and what she wants.

1554
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:30,572
But for me...

1555
01:15:30,655 --> 01:15:33,116
this is enough.

1556
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:37,912
Sitting down.

1557
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:40,206
- Well, sounds crazy, doesn't it?
- No, no, no.

1558
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,501
But I swear, I think that's it.

1559
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,962
All my life working...

1560
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:48,757
saving, building.

1561
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,803
For what? All I ever wanted
really was to...

1562
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:55,805
sit down...

1563
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,932
not worry about anything.

1564
01:15:58,016 --> 01:16:00,769
Oh, boy, I get it.

1565
01:16:00,852 --> 01:16:03,396
Believe me, I get it.

1566
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:08,902
You know what?

1567
01:16:08,985 --> 01:16:12,447
I think that's all
Mom wanted, too.

1568
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:18,620
Only she wanted to sit next to you.

1569
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,419
You're a nice guy,
you know that?

1570
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:29,589
Ah, that's the tequila talking.

1571
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:34,094
No. No, you're a nice fella.

1572
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:35,929
Ahh.

1573
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:40,684
Thanks for being my baby boy.

1574
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:44,938
I heard you with your girl.

1575
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:47,482
I think you got it right.

1576
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:51,444
I mean, a baby
comes into the world.

1577
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:55,448
Where's it gonna go?
It could go anywhere, right?

1578
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:58,952
You could've gone
to some parents in China...

1579
01:16:59,035 --> 01:17:01,788
or Timbuktu,
but you didn't.

1580
01:17:01,871 --> 01:17:03,957
You came to us.

1581
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,876
Why? Who the hell knows?

1582
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,505
But it worked out good.

1583
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:18,221
Well, thanks for being my daddy.

1584
01:17:18,304 --> 01:17:19,931
My pleasure.

1585
01:17:24,811 --> 01:17:27,522
Well, I'll tell you...

1586
01:17:27,605 --> 01:17:30,900
all I ever really wanted...

1587
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:32,444
really...

1588
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:40,452
pretty much this.

1589
01:18:36,966 --> 01:18:38,468
Benny?

1590
01:18:45,308 --> 01:18:46,601
Benny?

1591
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:02,283
Well, if that's camping...

1592
01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:05,078
I can do without it.

1593
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:11,626
What?

1594
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:15,714
Her doctors discovered it
two weeks ago.

1595
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:18,091
Told her it was inoperable.

1596
01:19:18,174 --> 01:19:21,803
They said,
''Figure six months.''

1597
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:25,724
I don't understand.
I mean, how can that be?

1598
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:28,059
She didn't tell anyone.
She didn't--she didn't--

1599
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:30,979
she didn't even tell the girls
till she was at the hospital already.

1600
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:32,397
She went out to the island...

1601
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,232
and she found some nice
little place on the water...

1602
01:19:34,315 --> 01:19:35,400
and she was--

1603
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:37,402
she was by herself
for a couple of days.

1604
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:39,404
She was feeling fine.

1605
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:43,450
And then she started--
she started blacking out.

1606
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,247
Oh, my God.

1607
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:52,083
Oh, my God.

1608
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:57,088
So, when she wrote that note
on the refrigerator...

1609
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:58,506
she made that all up?

1610
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:01,092
No, she didn't make it up.

1611
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:02,761
She did want to be alone.

1612
01:20:02,844 --> 01:20:05,764
Just for reasons...

1613
01:20:05,847 --> 01:20:08,058
nobody knew about.

1614
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:12,312
How could this be?

1615
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:44,320
Hello, my busy playboys.

1616
01:21:46,322 --> 01:21:49,659
Heh! Hello.

1617
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,000
All right. All right.

1618
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:58,793
Look at you.

1619
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:01,338
You don't need
to be so dramatic.

1620
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:03,298
I'm not going anywhere yet.

1621
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,924
And come here.

1622
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:10,430
How are you?

1623
01:22:10,513 --> 01:22:12,390
Better than you.

1624
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:14,768
What did the doctor say?

1625
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:16,936
Oh, the doctor.

1626
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,938
He said I'm an old lady...

1627
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:21,983
and this is what happens
to old ladies.

1628
01:22:23,693 --> 01:22:26,029
Why wouldn't you tell me?

1629
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:28,239
You think I tell you everything?

1630
01:22:29,866 --> 01:22:32,452
You know, you think
you're gonna live forever...

1631
01:22:32,535 --> 01:22:33,953
but you don't.

1632
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:37,707
Just live till one day,
and then suddenly...

1633
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,793
you're done.

1634
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:42,837
That's their big forever.

1635
01:22:42,879 --> 01:22:45,131
Oh, you got more visitors.

1636
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:47,967
Charlene, this is
my husband, my son.

1637
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:50,553
Now you know everyone.

1638
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:53,807
All right,
give a girl some privacy.

1639
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:54,849
Yeah, yeah.

1640
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:58,687
All righty, then.

1641
01:23:00,563 --> 01:23:02,524
Let's see if we can get you...

1642
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:14,953
Oh, wow, you guys drove fast.

1643
01:23:15,036 --> 01:23:16,162
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1644
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:17,580
Oh, it's nice to see you.

1645
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:18,915
Hi. Mwah.

1646
01:23:18,998 --> 01:23:20,417
- Mwah.
- Hi.

1647
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:22,419
Hey, look who's here.

1648
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:23,628
Hey. Hi. How are you?

1649
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:26,673
Hello, gorgeous girl.
How are you, honey?

1650
01:23:26,756 --> 01:23:27,716
Good to see you.

1651
01:23:27,799 --> 01:23:28,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

1652
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,927
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

1653
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,762
Sit down, darling.

1654
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:34,931
So, how was the farm?

1655
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,099
What farm?

1656
01:23:36,182 --> 01:23:38,727
They went to look at a house,
a farmhouse on a lake.

1657
01:23:38,768 --> 01:23:40,395
Nobody tells me anything.

1658
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:41,938
So was it nice?

1659
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:43,189
I don't want to talk about it.

1660
01:23:43,273 --> 01:23:46,943
Hey, this place didn't work out,
but let me say this.

1661
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:50,280
This guy is gonna find you a farm.

1662
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:51,781
I promise you that.

1663
01:23:51,865 --> 01:23:54,492
- I don't want a farm.
- What does that mean?

1664
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:56,411
- We need to live in the country?
- Yeah.

1665
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:58,538
Oh, you know that
I've never wanted that.

1666
01:23:58,621 --> 01:24:00,206
Don't you?

1667
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:02,334
Your mother wanted that.

1668
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,085
Not--not me.

1669
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:07,922
No, I know. I know she--

1670
01:24:07,964 --> 01:24:09,591
What are you saying?

1671
01:24:09,632 --> 01:24:11,343
So...you "don't" want it?

1672
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:13,386
Sorry.

1673
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:15,513
Wrong wife.

1674
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:17,932
So when--when we're
looking every Sunday...

1675
01:24:17,974 --> 01:24:19,768
in the magazine section
and you're pointing...

1676
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:21,269
and you're pointing it out,
what is that?

1677
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:24,856
Well, it seemed
so important to you.

1678
01:24:24,939 --> 01:24:27,734
How come you never
mentioned this before?

1679
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:29,319
Oh, I have.

1680
01:24:29,402 --> 01:24:32,113
You just haven't listened.

1681
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:34,449
Ahem.

1682
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:48,672
You know,
Benny showed me that letter.

1683
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:51,466
What letter?

1684
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:52,884
This letter.

1685
01:24:57,347 --> 01:24:59,974
- Where did you get this?
- Benny.

1686
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:01,893
What happened?
What did I do now?

1687
01:25:01,976 --> 01:25:04,813
I always wondered
where this went to.

1688
01:25:04,854 --> 01:25:07,148
This one took it.

1689
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,735
I thought maybe I threw it
in the garbage or something.

1690
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,488
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1691
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:14,906
Wait a minute.

1692
01:25:14,989 --> 01:25:18,576
You said a lot of things
in this letter.

1693
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:23,039
And I want you to know that...

1694
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:26,459
I didn't know.

1695
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:30,213
And now that you know?

1696
01:25:30,296 --> 01:25:33,591
Oh, now that I know?

1697
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:36,428
Now that I know, I feel...

1698
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:40,932
I feel bad.
What do you think?

1699
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:43,435
I feel shitty.

1700
01:25:43,518 --> 01:25:47,022
Listen, don't believe
everything you read.

1701
01:25:47,063 --> 01:25:48,940
What? What are you do--

1702
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:50,900
What--what--what--
what are you saying?

1703
01:25:52,193 --> 01:25:53,153
What?

1704
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:56,906
What, you didn't mean
what you wrote in the letter?

1705
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,616
Well...

1706
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,951
Hmm?

1707
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:03,955
Maybe...then.

1708
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,874
- Then.
- Then.

1709
01:26:05,957 --> 01:26:07,709
Yeah. How about now?

1710
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:11,254
How about all the years
between then and now?

1711
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,881
- Benny. What are you doing?
- Wait.

1712
01:26:12,964 --> 01:26:14,299
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

1713
01:26:14,382 --> 01:26:16,551
People change.

1714
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:18,178
You know.

1715
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:20,388
No, that's not true.

1716
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:21,931
No, people don't change.

1717
01:26:21,973 --> 01:26:24,642
They change their expectations.

1718
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:26,436
They adjust.

1719
01:26:26,519 --> 01:26:29,230
What?

1720
01:26:29,272 --> 01:26:31,733
Have I felt disappointed? Yes.

1721
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:33,610
All right?

1722
01:26:33,693 --> 01:26:36,237
Do I wish some things
had gone better?

1723
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:39,407
Of course, yes, I wish
some things had gone better.

1724
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:42,035
So, who gets
everything they want?

1725
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:46,664
OK. All right.

1726
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:48,416
What do you want me to say?

1727
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:49,793
Say what you want to say.

1728
01:26:51,586 --> 01:26:53,963
What are you saving it for?

1729
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:56,549
Come on, he's a big boy.

1730
01:26:59,052 --> 01:27:01,388
Hmm?

1731
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:03,598
Why did you leave him?

1732
01:27:03,682 --> 01:27:04,766
Truth.

1733
01:27:17,987 --> 01:27:20,573
I left...

1734
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:24,285
because I wanted to see
if I could.

1735
01:27:32,502 --> 01:27:34,254
I wanted to--

1736
01:27:34,337 --> 01:27:37,549
to be not taken for granted.

1737
01:27:51,354 --> 01:27:53,023
Plus...

1738
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:56,276
you know why else?

1739
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:59,195
I know that when I'm gone--

1740
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:00,947
heh--

1741
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:04,117
you're not gonna know
what to do.

1742
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,704
I don't think
you're so good by yourself.

1743
01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:10,206
This way, you could practice...

1744
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:14,627
see what it's like, you know?

1745
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:18,381
Heh. And if you
hated me for it...

1746
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,550
that's not so terrible.

1747
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:23,720
You'd all get to talk
about it together.

1748
01:28:36,483 --> 01:28:40,320
See, this is the thing
about my mother.

1749
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:43,573
She was made of love.

1750
01:28:43,656 --> 01:28:45,200
In the middle of all this...

1751
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:48,453
she was taking care
of everyone else.

1752
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:53,124
Under all that anger...

1753
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:55,752
after all that disappointment...

1754
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:57,754
the flame still flickered...

1755
01:28:57,837 --> 01:28:59,964
the love kept ticking.

1756
01:29:05,261 --> 01:29:08,390
And she still held on to hope.

1757
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:10,892
Despite everything she knew...

1758
01:29:10,934 --> 01:29:13,061
and even everything she said...

1759
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:16,481
she chose to believe
that things really might change.

1760
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:21,569
And my father--

1761
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:23,446
God bless him--

1762
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:26,950
to his credit
and to everyone's amazement...

1763
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:29,077
he did manage to change.

1764
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:33,123
He still had within him
the ability to surprise.

1765
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,128
OK, you can look.

1766
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,971
I heard you never got to go.

1767
01:29:52,308 --> 01:29:55,061
It's been closed for,
like, sixty years...

1768
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:56,438
so, you know...

1769
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,775
a lot of the best exhibits
aren't up anymore.

1770
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:03,486
On the other hand...

1771
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:07,490
on the other hand,
there's no lines.

1772
01:30:12,495 --> 01:30:15,957
Oh, almost forgot.

1773
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:19,461
I got a little something for you.

1774
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:23,631
What are you trying to do, kill me?

1775
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:44,027
So it took me
fifty years to understand.

1776
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,820
So?

1777
01:30:45,862 --> 01:30:49,324
I'm not the swiftest guy in town.

1778
01:30:49,366 --> 01:30:53,661
But now I'm all caught up,
what do you say we try again?

1779
01:30:53,703 --> 01:30:55,997
Round two.

1780
01:30:56,039 --> 01:30:58,833
We'll say round one
was everything up till now...

1781
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:01,419
and round two
is from today on.

1782
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:03,171
What do you think?

1783
01:31:03,213 --> 01:31:06,257
Sound like a plan to you?

1784
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:08,468
Your loving husband, Sam.

1785
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:17,310
OK.

1786
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:19,581
My mother made it
through the summer.

1787
01:32:19,664 --> 01:32:21,958
That's how long forever
turned out to be.

1788
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,336
But for that whole forever...

1789
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:27,464
it was the happiest
I ever saw them together.

1790
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:32,427
My father moved in with us
after that.

1791
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:34,596
We had our grapefruit juice
every morning...

1792
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:37,640
and watched the news
together every night.

1793
01:32:37,682 --> 01:32:40,143
It was a special, magical time.

1794
01:32:42,187 --> 01:32:44,939
But proving once again
that you never know...

1795
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:48,610
we woke up one morning,
and my father didn't.

1796
01:32:48,693 --> 01:32:50,653
He had been feeling perfectly fine.

1797
01:32:50,695 --> 01:32:53,823
I think he just really missed his gal.

1798
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:57,118
It was a year full of surprises.

1799
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:59,662
A few months later,
we had another baby--

1800
01:32:59,704 --> 01:33:01,956
a boy.

1801
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:06,127
We named him Martin Samuel,
after both of them.

1802
01:33:08,672 --> 01:33:11,257
The little guy never got to know
my mother and father...

1803
01:33:11,341 --> 01:33:14,678
but, as no love
shall heretofore be wasted...

1804
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:18,640
I promise you,
he's gonna hear all about 'em.
