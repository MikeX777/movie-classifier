Subtitles by Nostromo

3
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,050
Lydia!

4
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,334
Once together with me
the priest shall ask you

5
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,855
if you want to be
my chosen friend

6
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,738
Bravo,dear dad! What are you going
to call it,"Pine in the sun"?

7
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,526
Routine!I suggest "Sun over pines"!

8
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:50,526
-But that, ah

9
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,486
Filip,don't joke with Dad!

10
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,486
Edvard Bergh discovered
the Swedish birch grove

11
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,846
Dad discovered the archipelago
pine. Well done

12
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:02,006
Painting it is not an art either,
I'm painting as well as I did 40 years ago

13
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,326
But selling it,that's art!

14
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:05,446
It takes time to learn

15
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,137
You're a great artist, dear dad!

16
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,486
Freutiger is coming here tonight.
Then we'll sing together!

17
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:15,926
-Baron Freutiger alone?
-Yes,that would be a nice quartet

18
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:20,926
Oh, no, clerk Lovén
and candidate Stjärnblom are also coming.

19
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:26,469
Lovén, that loudmouth?
Then please let me disappear

20
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:27,766
I would like to see that

21
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:31,326
A tenor who can shut
up when he hears others sing

22
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:32,906
I've never heard of anything like that!

23
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:35,206
You can sing according to your style

24
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,726
Yes, yes, but there will
be not much of a banquet

25
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:41,396
Perch, smoked ham, herring and
potatoes, that's all there is

26
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,286
Vodka and punch, beer and brandy.

27
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:47,646
What more is needed,
all glorious gifts of God!

28
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,126
-Good day, everyone!
-Good day Miss Lydia ...

29
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:55,486
Welcome

30
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,526
Do you have any brandy, little thief?
We have whiskey

31
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:06,686
That's fine. Then we'll drink the whiskey
and save the brandy

32
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:17,326
The moon, he shines,
the water glitters calmly and cold

33
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:25,286
The lilac, jasmines
spread the scent all over

34
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,926
The butterfly in gold and green

35
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,366
glimmers on the flower beautifully

36
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,486
The worm soon crawls

37
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:45,366
out of its gravel

38
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,966
The worm soon crawls

39
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:57,850
out of its gravel

40
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,606
It must be wonderful to have such
a beautiful voice as that of the clerk!

41
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:10,726
The born King of the songs

42
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,126
No, now I must go in and make sure
we get something to eat

43
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:18,526
Yes,please do that nice, good,
and beautiful sweet Miss Lydia!

44
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,686
Are you going to have
an exhibition this autumn?

45
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,046
For what purpose?

46
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,166
One can't,damn me,learn all
modern dirty tricks,I'm too old. Cheers!

47
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,206
-Cheers
-Cheers

48
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,366
Too old! When it comes to toasting all
nights and boozing like a trooper

49
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,606
then they are not too old!

50
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:44,326
Thank God for that Augusta

51
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:47,286
We have seen the bottom
of the world's swindle!

52
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:52,006
Lovén,he can only
look upwards because he is a tenor.

53
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,406
Stjärnblom, he is young.
Young people only see themselves

54
00:05:57,406 --> 00:06:01,006
Consider us older as
pure staffage in the painting.

55
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,006
-Isn't it so, Arvid?
-Cheers

56
00:06:05,246 --> 00:06:06,526
-Cheers
-Cheers

57
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,166
-Lydia?
-Meow

58
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,036
What do you think about it that?

59
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,896
-You and Lydia? To be married?
-Sure, why not?

60
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,126
None of your cheek,you old swine!

61
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,546
Cheers!

62
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,046
Just that you would
be in Stockholm this winter

63
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,046
and that we might see and
meet each other occasionally!

64
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:06,166
That's just enough for me

65
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:10,246
-Do you start at the Nationalbladet?
-Yes

66
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,846
It's one of my fifty-eleven
cousins ​​who has picked me

67
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:17,846
His name is Markel,
he is deputy head of the editorial office

68
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,646
I can just do that,like something else
You have to do something while you wait.

69
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,966
Waiting for what?

70
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:26,646
I don't know

71
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,286
Maybe for nothing at all.

72
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,406
That I could do
something that works out

73
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,646
Your future

74
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,046
The future, yes. What do we know about it?

75
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,446
Do you think

76
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,926
Do you think that you and I

77
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:47,366
could create us
a small world for ourselves?

78
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,566
We must try.

79
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,126
The table is served on the verandah.

80
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:04,166
At last, a piece of food should
really taste deliciously on the verandah

81
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:05,326
Yes, I promise

82
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,846
Singer! Here's the first!

83
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:23,206
I believe in you. I believe in you.
and I can wait!

84
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,806
... he only thinks of parting

85
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:40,406
Good night, my dear!

86
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:47,415
Good night, my dear

87
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:55,406
my dear love!

88
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,006
-Did you propose?
-When could I have the possibility?

89
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,286
-But she probably understood me.
-Sure! Your song was symbolic.

90
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:11,586
What do you mean?

91
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,546
I'm just thinking about your false notes.

92
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:18,086
Well yes, we are both young
and we can wait.

93
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,446
I couldn't stand the thought
of someone waiting for me.

94
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,606
Take it easy, you will
probably be the one waiting

95
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,206
One is expecting something from me

96
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:29,786
If I have that thought all the time,
then nothing will become of me

97
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,126
But it's Roslin!

98
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:45,006
Lydia, Lydia, have you seen what
a nice traveling companion we got!

99
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,926
May I say it was a
pleasant surprise!

100
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,286
Does Miss Lydia recognize me?

101
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:51,286
Well,wouldn't I remember Dr. Roslin?

102
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:53,046
Well, there's a few years ago.

103
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,926
Miss Lydia has become the
great lady!

104
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:58,086
The grand beautiful lady

105
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,446
-Miss Stille,my sister Esther.
-Good day

106
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,646
So you're done with sail ship
paintings?Had enough time for it

107
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,006
Yes, now I'll go in and sell them

108
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:13,646
You might need a couple of pines
to freshen up your castle walls?

109
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,666
Yes, I could

110
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:18,046
Yes, why should my gallery
be worse than the National Museum?

111
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,126
Or the Luxembourg gallery

112
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,846
But you know I have
a painting in the Luxembourg gallery

113
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:24,846
Well, I've heard that.

114
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,726
Yes, we'll see

115
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:31,006
It would be nice also
to revive our old friendship.

116
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:15,806
Dr Doncker Chief Editor

117
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,486
-Is Dr. Markel still here?
-Yeah,he is

118
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,366
Do you have the duty tonight?

119
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,926
Yes, I have, but now I'm going to go
and get a piece of food.

120
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:33,166
Good afternoon

121
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:34,886
Good afternoon

122
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,046
You can say what you like, but
meatballs and brown beans

123
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:06,726
In any case, surpass
all the delicacies of the Orient.

124
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,606
Or what do you think?

125
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:11,006
Of course funny talk

126
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,846
What did you say?

127
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:16,806
Whom did you greet?

128
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,966
A girl I met in
the archipelago this summer

129
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,526
A family girl?

130
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,246
Sure, a family girl

131
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:27,406
Damn you,beware of that! Such acquaintances
are very good during summer

132
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:31,846
but if you continue with them,
you can get caught before you know it.

133
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,786
No,I'll probably will be beware of that

134
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,646
But maybe you can go
ahead and marry her?

135
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,526
On my income as a proof reader
and journalist volunteer?

136
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:43,846
No, dear Markel, I don't think so

137
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:46,846
Honors to your judgment,thank you

138
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,886
Before we hacks reach the time we can
defend bringing children into the world

139
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,086
With any luck

140
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:57,310
 we'll be so old and ill-equipped
that we can no longer defend it.

141
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,806
And seduce her? Well, it has its risks

142
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:04,166
If you succeed, you will lose
all respect for her

143
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,446
and if you fail

144
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:08,006
then you'll lose all respect, which you
perhaps had for yourself.

145
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:11,766
-You don't know the girl
-No,if I did that

146
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:14,886
Then maybe I would have a
completely different view of the matter

147
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:22,046
Lydia! Some short summer days
of sun and happiness

148
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,806
And now the autumn has arrived

149
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,726
So, Mr. Stjärnblom
whistling Pathétique?

150
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:31,946
Whoops! I apologize

151
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,326
Well, by all means

152
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:36,846
But it fits perfectly. Then you
will go to the Opera and review tonight!

153
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,166
-Shall I?
-Yes

154
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:42,206
It's a little girl who will
make her debut as Margareta in Faust.

155
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,526
But our regular music reviewer
has become ill

156
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:48,006
I usually substitute for
him myself, but I'm going to dinner

157
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,566
Goodbye, goodbye!

158
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,699
Though my heart is stabbed deeply

159
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,894
Though my heart is stabbed deeply

160
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,046
Girl - watch out!

161
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:18,526
Remember, with ring on the finger

162
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:22,486
first you should kiss!

163
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:27,006
Remember with ring on the finger

164
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:31,486
first you should kiss

165
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,766
first you kiss

166
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,166
should!

167
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:44,086
Yes, that sounds good,generally

168
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:47,006
The girls probably know best themselves
in what order it should come

169
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,246
isn't it like that,Miss Stille?

170
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,486
Hope so. You get so much
expert advice these days.

171
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,606
There you got it!
Lydia doesn't need any advice

172
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,126
Thank you for the trust, dear Dad.

173
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:09,046
No, now I have to leave.
Are you staying long?

174
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:14,086
No,I'll stay for a while
and then I will come home

175
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,046
Yes, but this is good!

176
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,566
"Miss Klarholm's voice and singing talent
points to almost unlimited possibilities."

177
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,406
"Her acting, however, indicates
a lack of instruction."

178
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:56,966
"Margareta will only
go insane in the prison scene"

179
00:16:56,966 --> 00:17:00,766
"but Miss Klarholm played insane
almost from the beginning"

180
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,846
"This Margareta
seemed born insane."

181
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,726
That was not bad! People don't like
to hear too much praise about others.

182
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:15,746
However,the one who receives the 
praise thinks it is never enough

183
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:17,406
and the others become jealous.

184
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,086
But if a critic scolds a
commander or a singer

185
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:25,246
then ONE will be sad and
all the others will be happy.

186
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,686
So just go on scolding,you should try to
spread some joy among humanity!

187
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:34,526
Thanks

188
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,806
Good evening!

189
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,606
-Yes, yes, old Stille is dead.
-What are you saying?

190
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,006
What is it? How can it affect
you in any way?

191
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:56,046
I knew him a bit.

192
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:58,286
Yes, he was old
and we are all going to die

193
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:01,086
Almost everyone

194
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:07,646
As Louis XIV's court preacher added when
he saw that the king's face went gloomy

195
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,346
I've not heard at all
that he has been ill

196
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:13,126
No, he hasn't been either,
it was a tram accident.

197
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,686
How did it happen?

198
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,806
He had been binging
with some happy blokes

199
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:18,326
And then he would take the tram home

200
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,446
did not think he was
more than sixty years old

201
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,486
He tried to jump on the trailer,well

202
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,726
then he fell and hit his
head on the street.

203
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,446
Here is the obituary
from the Nordic Family Book.

204
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:33,286
Can you be kind enough and take it
because you knew him

205
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,526
You could probably write to something
that is a little more personally tinged

206
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,206
I'm going down
and look at the printer's error

207
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,646
Excuse me,where's the advertising and
announcement department?

208
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,006
Please, it's up there.

209
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,966
I was going to ask to
publish a small notice

210
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:11,706
Thank you for everything beautiful
that was written about dad

211
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,766
-But I couldn't find the way.
-I can show the way.

212
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:18,446
Thanks

213
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,566
But why such a hurry?

214
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,366
Don't you want to sit
with me for a while?

215
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,966
Yes, if it is possible

216
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,966
Aren't you going to take off your hat?

217
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:52,499
If it is suitable? Someone might come

218
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:54,396
that will look awkward

219
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,926
No one is coming.

220
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,726
Is this where you sit and write?

221
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:18,726
Sometimes

222
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,666
Most of the time I sit in the
large editorial room

223
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,986
along with fifty other poor hacks

224
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,686
But if someone wants you for something?
You take it very easy

225
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:30,126
You can take it easy

226
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,006
It is not that much respected
in this editorial office

227
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:38,126
but one thing is respected
unconditionally, a closed door.

228
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,886
What are you going to do
now when your dad is dead?

229
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,226
I'll try to find a place.

230
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,886
Yes, I have to work. Dad did
not leave much behind.

231
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:04,846
Thank you for sending the wreath

232
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,806
-What are you're going to work with?
-With anything

233
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,886
If the Lady in the
house wants to shop

234
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:16,126
I don't have any special abilities.
Domestic work is the only thing I can do.

235
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,166
Do you remember when we saw each other
at the restaurant?

236
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,486
You were in the company of a gentleman.

237
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:25,526
That was Doctor Roslin.

238
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:29,046
Markus Roslin, the cultural historian
and archaeologist? -Yes

239
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:34,566
An old friend of Dad. He has an estate
in Sörmland called Stjärnvik.

240
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,526
I have to tell you something.

241
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,166
The next day I felt a completely
irresistible longing to talk with you.

242
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,806
So I went up to the house where
you live and rang the doorbell

243
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,686
Lo and behold.

244
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:57,446
But you only rang once.
I couldn't imagine that it was you.

245
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,326
I don't like to ring more than once.
I also respect a closed door.

246
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:04,686
Lydia

247
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,806
May I ask you a question?

248
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:11,726
Yes

249
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:14,086
You must promise me not
to get angry with me

250
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,366
No

251
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,446
Are you..?

252
00:22:18,806 --> 00:22:21,166
Are you ... an innocent girl?

253
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,566
Yes, you witnessed that

254
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:26,366
Are you angry at me for asking?

255
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:27,406
No

256
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,486
Do you know what I was thinking
when you didn't open?

257
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:36,326
I thought like this

258
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,446
"Then I have nothing
to save myself for."

259
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:43,046
-Yes but ..
-That's it

260
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,566
Lydia

261
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:49,926
I can't think of marriage ...

262
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,166
other than as in a distant future,
you have to understand that.

263
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:55,046
Yes

264
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,766
But if you wanted to be
my secret lover...

265
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:06,126
No, I don't want to be a burden for you.

266
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:10,126
Everything else, but
not a burden for you

267
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,406
I must go now.

268
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,686
-Am I not allowed to see you some time?
-I don't know

269
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,486
I want to whisper something in your ear

270
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,646
I want to, but I don't dare.

271
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:59,366
"I want out .and so far, far
away" Lydia(In Norwegian)

272
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,606
-Damned!
-What then?

273
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,726
Look for yourself!

274
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,246
Engaged

275
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,326
What do you think of that?

276
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:36,366
That girl is not content with trifles!

277
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,526
Markus Roslin! At least 600000!

278
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:44,006
-600 000?
-Not a penny less.

279
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,166
And can you imagine

280
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:50,846
She's the only girl I've ever
loved. Seriously, you see!

281
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,046
Two weeks after old Stille's death
I wrote to her and proposed

282
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:57,286
Honestly,correct

283
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,406
As I believe with exact information about
my fortune, a little over 200000 crowns

284
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,686
I got an answer immediately.
Signed "Respectfully"

285
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,966
Then you can roughly imagine the content!

286
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,846
- "I want out"
-What did you say?

287
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:18,966
Nothing.

288
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,966
Well, then of course I thought
she found me too old

289
00:25:22,966 --> 00:25:25,166
Forty-six years and she nineteen.

290
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,406
I must admire her steadfastness

291
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:30,006
in the prospect of being well supported

292
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:35,806
But Roslin is over fifty, so it was
not the age that was wrong with me

293
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,486
That was not the cause

294
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,606
Dear Freutiger

295
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:44,406
you don't think seriously

296
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:47,006
that the difference in wealth
was the decisive factor for her?

297
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,106
Yeah,what the hell are
you else going to think?

298
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:52,046
You must have money for living

299
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,886
But a little more or less,
she has probably not thought of that

300
00:25:57,486 --> 00:25:59,566
No,perhaps not

301
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,166
I guess she just thought Roslin
was a little more in shape than I was.

302
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,326
And then she can expect to become a widow
a few years earlier with him than with me

303
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,806
We should hope that she soon finish him
off, he is a frail weakling

304
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,326
That she would be in love with
him is out of the question.

305
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,886
Would you like to have dinner with me?

306
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:26,326
-Thank you but I probably can't.
-We'll eat well, drink like hell!

307
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:27,156
Thanks,thanks

308
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,646
I have to go to the newspaper.

309
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,326
No,but Markus

310
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,621
Do you like it?

311
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:04,541
Like it? It's wonderful!

312
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,981
It's more than that, it's a relic.

313
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:11,261
A relic? Tell me!

314
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,581
I bought it thirty years ago
for a woman I loved.

315
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,701
But she betrayed me before she got it.

316
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,621
Then I promised myself that
no one else would wear it

317
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:27,101
Than the woman who would mean more
to me than anything else in the world

318
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,661
And that woman ...

319
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:33,221
That woman is you.

320
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,341
-If you let me down ...
-No Markus

321
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,941
We have just returned
home from our honeymoon

322
00:27:40,941 --> 00:27:45,381
-You're young, I'm old.
-But we will share my youth

323
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:47,981
Then I will share your old age.

324
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:52,061
If you let me down, you'll never
wear that ring again, you promise me.

325
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,341
I promise!

326
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,021
But then you must also
promise me something.

327
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,341
Yes

328
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:05,141
Taste this omelet
before it gets cold

329
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,461
I just got it ready

330
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:18,361
Yes, that's fine,I'll have a look!

331
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:19,916
Thanks

332
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,621
Will you come and have
dinner with the builder Randels?

333
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:25,288
-Absolutely not
-Why not?

334
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,341
You've given me a reason,
I'm not invited.

335
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,101
It doesn't matter

336
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:33,821
I have some cards here that I have had
to hand out among desirable persons

337
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:35,756
So just put the name in there.

338
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,021
Come on, never hurts to
show up,I'll tell you

339
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,141
I must admit that Randels doesn't
exactly belong to the highest society.

340
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,181
Yes,then welcome !

341
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,621
The Director and Mrs Jacob
Randel have the honor

342
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:51,301
 to invite Mr Editor Arvid Stjärnblom
to dinner 13th October at 6 pm

343
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,701
Nice delicious study,isn't it?

344
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,021
Refined

345
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,541
And so similar ... so natural, I mean.

346
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,601
Extremely natural

347
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,461
I got it in Paris.

348
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,141
The French they know!

349
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,661
6000 francs! A nice sum of money!

350
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:22,901
But it's worth it,isn't it?

351
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:27,541
I don't know if it is,you can get
a real alive much cheaper.

352
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,061
How can Mr Markel know that?

353
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,021
I know someone who has tried.

354
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,981
Dagmar! Dagmar!

355
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,841
Is no one inviting you to dance?

356
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,861
No! But I
was just going to invite Mr. Stjärnblom!

357
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,501
I dare not even dream of such an honor!

358
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,581
Gallop!

359
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,621
It was strenuous!
You start getting old.

360
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,821
Yes, we all do

361
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,301
Isn't it fun to be with the
grown ups and play too?

362
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,941
-I will be 26 years old on the 20th
-Yes, it's awful.

363
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,521
What should I say when I
turn 28 on the exact same day!

364
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:38,821
But really, do we have the same birthday?

365
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,741
Yes, that was funny!

366
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:45,221
-Do you want something to drink?
-Thank you,with pleasure

367
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,541
Well,there we have the conqueror

368
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,861
Yes,I saw her just when the
girl came here with her

369
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:13,601
Damned you! Beware!
Randel has an atrocious business.

370
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,161
You've already told me that

371
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:18,461
-It's nothing I want at all
-You don't realize it

372
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:22,581
This rose costs two crowns
this season,at least!

373
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:24,701
The girl wants to get married.

374
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:28,261
Look, Markel, you don't want to imagine me

375
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,381
that I,with my small salary would be
a favorable match in her eyes?

376
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,341
No, it's she who imagines
that her father is rich

377
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:37,461
and that she is a favorable party.

378
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,861
-And she wants to get married!
-But not I.

379
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:42,381
What does it help

380
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,541
You don't choose your destiny

381
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,501
not your wife,your mistress
and your children.

382
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,101
You get them, and you have them.
You may lose them.

383
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,701
But you don't choose.

384
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,621
-Good day,Mr. Stjärnblom
-Good day, Miss Randel.

385
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,101
-The letter was to you.
-To me?

386
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:30,581
Just a small thank you
for the beautiful flower.

387
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,381
I feel unworthy and broken-hearted

388
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:35,941
I had not sent you
any flowers!

389
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,341
No, why would you do that?

390
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,317
It is neither in the Bible
nor in the Catechism

391
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:41,141
That you shall send
flowers for birthdays

392
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,741
You only do it when you feel like it

393
00:32:43,301 --> 00:32:44,661
And so I got the urge

394
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,821
-Where are you going?
-Yes, I was going to have dinner.

395
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:52,661
-Are you very hungry?
-No

396
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:54,481
Do you not feel like taking a
short walk then?

397
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:56,741
I was just going to suggest it

398
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,501
You understand that I
can't think of getting married at all?

399
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:27,821
No, that's something
I've not be thinking about

400
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,741
I understand quite well that
you don't want to get married.

401
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:41,101
Almost all marriages become
unhappy nowadays

402
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,141
Is it your stepmother you're lamenting?

403
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:46,381
No, Dad's probably fine.

404
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:48,181
That's fine

405
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,021
But Arvid

406
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,781
when you don't want to get married

407
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:54,381
is it just because you can't afford it?

408
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,881
I never said I did not want to,
I've said I can't.

409
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:00,061
-Yes but
-But what?

410
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,181
Dad has said that if I get married then

411
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:06,581
he will contribute to the household.

412
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,741
My dear, I don't want to be
financially dependent on your father.

413
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,101
But dependent, Arvid..

414
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,661
So far, I've been able to
sort myself out somewhat.

415
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:19,581
It's evident you'll
sort it out yourself

416
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:27,001
Tomorrow I have to go straight to my father
and mother out to the countryside again.

417
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,021
Who knows when I may be
able to travel into town next time

418
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,361
In a way suits us both

419
00:34:31,781 --> 00:34:35,141
Doncker and I have just agreed
that I will do the continent this summer.

420
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,301
Do the continent?

421
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,941
Travel about a few weeks

422
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:43,781
watch some cultural events,
do some great interviews

423
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,101
And music?

424
00:34:45,101 --> 00:34:48,901
Mm, everything possible, you have
to try staying all-round.

425
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,421
Who knows, in a few years I may
be the foreign editor of Nationalbladet

426
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,141
-And still music reviewer?
-Mm

427
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,261
Then with double pay?

428
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,141
But Markus

429
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:12,701
why don't you want a child?

430
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,541
Because I'm a genius!
Yes, it is said between us

431
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,156
And don't spread it

432
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,501
But I'm a genius

433
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,901
and children of geniuses
often become idiots.

434
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,981
That's why I don't want children.

435
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,261
But it is possible that the
child would take after me

436
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:42,661
And I'm not a genius.

437
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,861
Of course you are,
a diplomatic genius.

438
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,261
But you are first and foremost
my wife.

439
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,301
I'm a woman!
I would like to have a small child.

440
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,261
It's probably not part of his program

441
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,701
No, he bought me as
his legal mistress!

442
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,141
But Lydia?

443
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,761
Don't think about that.
Now you are going to travel

444
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:35,716
Travel?

445
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,661
And look at the latest harvest of Greek
vases and ancient broken statues!

446
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,981
Dagmar! What is that?

447
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:00,141
What is it?

448
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:02,141
Dagmar

449
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:08,501
What is it,little child?

450
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:09,981
-Has something happened?
-Yes

451
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:12,061
Just don't

452
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:19,181
My stepmother had heard some talk
about us and so she gossiped to my dad.

453
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:25,821
It was not malicious,she is not mean
but she lives in gossip.

454
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,701
Dad became terribly angry
and interrogated me.

455
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:33,401
Of course,first I thought of
denying everything

456
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:38,541
but then I was ashamed and you know
I couldn't

457
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:40,381
And when I said ..

458
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:41,941
Yes,what did you say?

459
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,661
That we were secretly engaged.

460
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:54,241
But what did you want me to say?

461
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:55,821
Well,no

462
00:37:57,101 --> 00:37:59,121
No, you couldn’t say otherwise.

463
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,381
Well, what did your father say?

464
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:06,221
At first he called me
a slut and enjoyed the pleasure

465
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,021
But then he calmed down

466
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:11,741
But then he said that he stood by
the two thousand if it came to marriage

467
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:14,821
He said nothing bad about you.

468
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,061
Is it really that impossible
for you to get married?

469
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,581
It seems to me
rather impossible.

470
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,821
Don't cry,dear!

471
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:40,981
Don't cry

472
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,781
We must try to do
the impossible

473
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:56,821
Arvid

474
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:07,101
Welcome, Mr. Stjärnblom! Yes, little Dagmar
has prepared us for your visit.

475
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,061
And that's probably how
"La belle Hélène" sings:

476
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:14,141
"We must have love, but never too small"

477
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,581
My husband is waiting for you
inside his room please this way

478
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,861
Jakob!

479
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,741
-Welcome, Mr. Stjärnblom!
-Thanks

480
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,381
Yes, my daughter has
told me how it is ...

481
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,601
Does Mr. Stjärnblom want to drink
a glass of punch?

482
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:40,701
Thanks

483
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:44,421
Please

484
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,181
Well, the newspaper business is not as bad
these days as it used to be before

485
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,341
No, by all means, you can
drag yourself forward.

486
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,741
The youth must not have
too great pretensions.

487
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,501
But to begin with, we can
drop the titles. You can say uncle. Cheers

488
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,861
Cheers, uncle

489
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,781
Yes, your newspaper is going forward!

490
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,501
Yes,probably.

491
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,901
I met Dr. Doncker
at a dinner the other day.

492
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:24,461
He wanted me to buy
some shares in the newspaper.

493
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,501
Well,now I'll enter into
a form of clash of duties

494
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:33,141
As an employee of the newspaper,I should,
of course,advise my uncle to buy shares

495
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,181
but as my uncle's possible
son-in-law, I must advise against it

496
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,101
Well,it doesn't matter

497
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,781
I have nothing to buy for
These are bad times.

498
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,181
Well, have the gentlemen come to any
result? Food is served!

499
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:54,661
Ask Dagmar to come here.

500
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:05,061
Yes,my little girl,now you'll
get the man you wanted.

501
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,941
And above all, I want to
put to your hearts

502
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:12,941
a small verse from the old book of Psalms

503
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,621
"Thou shalt not commit adultery,
as that would be a great torment."

504
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:19,981
But Dad !

505
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:22,661
Yes,that's really true is,
I know it from my own experience

506
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,341
Now we'll go and have a
schnapps and a sandwich, come on!

507
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:33,008
Married
Arvid Stjärnblom and Dagmar Randel

508
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,461
-Ester
-Yes?

509
00:41:42,781 --> 00:41:44,581
Who's coming
to dinner today?

510
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:53,341
The old ordinary. Stångbergs. Wulfcronas,
Gaddes, and Lundgrens from Sjötorp.

511
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:55,301
Mrs. Lundgren has had
a couple of cousins ​​visiting

512
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,541
so there is always a bit of variety.

513
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,741
And Captain Linde at Berga?

514
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:04,541
Yes, of course, what
else would the girls say?

515
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,341
My husband travels tomorrow to the
Archaeological Congress in Amsterdam.

516
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:57,061
Lydia

517
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:34,301
Lay down

518
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:36,221
Now you must sleep

519
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:37,321
There you go

520
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:50,261
Good night, sleep well

521
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,721
Well,now,how do you think I look like?

522
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:05,181
Nice. Adorable.

523
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,921
It's awful just wearing this old dress

524
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:09,661
when,for once,we are going to Donckers

525
00:44:09,721 --> 00:44:11,541
I can imagine you wish for something

526
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,101
Last year, we at least had Dad's
quarterly contribution to fall back on

527
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:20,341
It was not fun for you
when it dried up.

528
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,981
Dear Dagmar

529
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:24,701
Frankly, I never thought we
would receive that appanage

530
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:25,861
more than the first year

531
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:27,541
I didn't dare to think further

532
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,621
I have nothing at all to blame your father.
I had no illusions.

533
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,061
You, if they were to ask me to sing
tonight,what shall we suggest?

534
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,861
Let us hope they'll not ask you.

535
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,661
Where is the ring?

536
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:47,221
- Emma! -Yes, my Lady
-Has Emma seen Mr. Stjärnblom's ring?

537
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:49,156
No

538
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,901
Oh, my God, he must have his ring

539
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:53,461
Yes, it doesn't matter,
we can't be late to Donckers

540
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,781
The ring may be found later

541
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:56,621
Emma, ​​it's probably not that late tonight

542
00:44:57,221 --> 00:44:59,661
Emma doesn't go out,I mean
if the children should wake up

543
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,181
That's all right, come on,
come on, let's go.

544
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,441
Do you, as a matter of principle,
never wear a wedding ring?

545
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:14,021
No, I make it a principle
never to have principles

546
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,601
-I forgot it, quite simply.
-Can you forget something like that?

547
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:19,681
You can forget just about anything.

548
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,341
-Forget what?
-The wedding ring!

549
00:45:22,941 --> 00:45:25,221
What? Forget the wedding ring, listen

550
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:27,261
Now just confess why you
put it in your vest pocket

551
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:29,101
No, I certainly didn't,
I forgot it.

552
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:31,601
-I have placed it somewhere
-Yes, that is absolutely true.

553
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:32,341
Is that true?

554
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:34,241
Arvid is certainly not
that kind of husband

555
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:37,201
who puts the ring in the west
pocket when it suits him,doesn't he?

556
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,021
There you have it,I'm exonerated

557
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,261
No, now I unfortunately have to leave

558
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,661
-Opera.
-Yes of course

559
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,301
Mrs. Klarhom-Fibiger as Senta in
The Dutchman for the first time

560
00:45:49,301 --> 00:45:51,421
Yes, it can't be passed unnoticed

561
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:53,501
The second act begins just
before 9 pm,just in time

562
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:55,501
- Will you come and pick me up later?
-Of course

563
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:56,621
At what time?

564
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,861
I must go down to the newspaper after
the opera I can be here at 12 o'clock

565
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:02,521
Or one o'clock or two o'clock

566
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:04,021
Yes,I know that

567
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:06,901
No, go home right away.
Unfortunately, I have to go home early.

568
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:10,261
I can never be sure that our
maid stays at home with the children.

569
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:11,781
That's a tragedy

570
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,401
-Yes,good night
-Good night to you

571
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,541
Yes,not easy to be the wife
of a journalist,isn't it?

572
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,301
It's getting worse, Mrs. Stjärnblom

573
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,456
Worse? Why?

574
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,201
Yes, he doesn't know anything yet,
but can you keep a secret?

575
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,341
Indeed

576
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:42,074
Senta's Aria from Flying Dutchman

577
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,981
Are you happy?

578
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,781
No human being is happy.

579
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,901
You have to live anyway,
as best as you can.

580
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,581
Yes, you have to

581
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:12,961
Did I scare you? I knew
it would be late because of your newspaper

582
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,581
I found your ring.

583
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,581
-Well, where then?
-In my bed.

584
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,701
What are you doing?

585
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,281
I'm just checking the accounts

586
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,581
You handle the bank
loan properly,don't you?

587
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:38,381
Yes,you stay calm

588
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,101
Yes that would be awkward

589
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:43,261
if Baron Freutiger and Dr.
Doncker regretted signing

590
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,541
I don't think that would happen.

591
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,721
It'll probably get better soon, you'll see.

592
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,061
Dr. Doncker told
me something today.

593
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:58,221
Later tonight when you had gone

594
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:00,421
Guess!

595
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,821
You will be the foreign
editor in the new year.

596
00:50:06,021 --> 00:50:07,581
And still have the music column left!

597
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,301
Think how much money
you're going to make, huh?

598
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:12,581
Then everything is fine.

599
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,341
Are you coming soon?

600
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,261
Who were with you at the Opera?

601
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:35,021
My sister-in-law, Ester Roslin.

602
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,181
She is so fond of Mrs. Klarholm-
Fibiger, like you, I understand.

603
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,221
What have I written?

604
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,021
"Mrs. Klarholm-Fibiger's voice is
of that kind."

605
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:53,981
"which evokes dreams and illusions" -

606
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,181
- "about a happiness
over all human and earthly happiness."

607
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,501
"about sensual pleasure
above all other sensual pleasure ..."

608
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:10,021
"... about eternity and bliss,
and eternal bliss."

609
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,341
- Did I write it last night?
-It looks like that.

610
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,941
It must have been because I was sitting
by your side when I heard her.

611
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,301
-It's a beautiful ring.
-Yes

612
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:33,541
I got it from Markus.

613
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,941
He took from me the promise to never
wear it again if I let him down.

614
00:51:38,941 --> 00:51:40,921
And have you kept that promise?

615
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,541
Lydia!

616
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,661
Can you tell me one thing?

617
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,541
Where is Taunitzer See?

618
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:02,021
Taunitzer See?

619
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:04,621
Taunitzer See

620
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,021
I don't know.

621
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:11,261
It's probably somewhere in
Germany or Switzerland

622
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,541
Are you going there?

623
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:14,381
I probably wanted to

624
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:17,781
If only I could find out
where it's.

625
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,621
It should not be that difficult.

626
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,201
I'm afraid that will not be easy

627
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,301
I was awake last night thinking of
a place in "NÅR VI DØDE VÅGNER"(Ibsen)

628
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,061
And all the time it rang in my ears:

629
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,661
"Nice, nice
was life at Taunitzer See!"

630
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,061
And so I thought that lake
certainly doesn't exist ...

631
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,261
No, of course not.

632
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:55,121
That lake may not be
so easy to find on the map

633
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,961
Maybe that's just the beauty of it.

634
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,941
Do you remember the time
when you appeared on Nationalbladet?

635
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:08,501
Yes

636
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,221
I asked you something ...

637
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:14,221
I asked you for something

638
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,541
I remember ...
A bit vague. But I remember.

639
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,141
You replied,
"I want to, but I don't dare."

640
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,021
Did I really say that? Yes

641
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,861
Yes, that was that time.

642
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,941
Have you possibly become a bit
more brave since then?

643
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:38,581
Perhaps

644
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,061
Do you remember?

645
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,061
Yes ... and you've hidden it!

646
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,301
You got what you wanted.

647
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,821
Do you long for even further,
even further away?

648
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,141
Now I would like to change
that line like this:

649
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:14,541
"I want home, I want home
to my real home."

650
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,341
I just don't know where it is.

651
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,221
When did you write this?

652
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,341
Some years ago.

653
00:54:27,261 --> 00:54:29,996
 It was probably a short 
time after my marriage.

654
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,861
"It has since become autumnal."

655
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,961
Yes, it has been early autumn
for both of us.

656
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,781
Ultimately,it depends upon ourselves

657
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:46,981
if we want to make do with the autumn

658
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,901
or make us a high summer.

659
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,056
Do you still care about me?

660
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:02,781
I can never in time and eternity
care about anyone else but you.

661
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:11,541
Once in your poor life,
you should still be allowed

662
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:15,101
-to try to find your way
to your Taunitzer See

663
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,701
I get up before you

664
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:23,981
Which room?

665
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:25,501
Number 12.

666
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:52,181
I was just missing going through
the rest of my life

667
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:55,141
without ever having belonged to you

668
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,101
That was just missing!

669
00:55:58,961 --> 00:56:01,181
That was just missing!

670
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,021
Taste this.
Is it as usual ?

671
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,061
Are you afraid of being poisoned?

672
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,841
In that case,it wouldn't be the first
time an old husband went that route!

673
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,781
The usual taste,I think

674
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:27,281
Are you saying that?

675
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,421
That was good, I feel it.

676
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:44,061
Yes, yes,my dear Lydia, I understand ...

677
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:47,381
You're uncomfortable here at Stjärnvik.

678
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,481
You would rather live in Stockholm?

679
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:52,281
Yes, I probably would like that

680
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,601
And why now?

681
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:59,461
Theaters, social life, and so on.

682
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,181
Maybe that too.

683
00:57:05,661 --> 00:57:07,261
But that's not the important thing.

684
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,981
And the important thing is?

685
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,781
That I don't love you

686
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:22,201
and that married life
with you is a torment for me.

687
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,381
Love? Dear Lydia,I'm an old man,
but I'm not an idiot.

688
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,941
Have I ever asked
if you loved me?

689
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,701
No

690
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:35,941
I have to admit that

691
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,181
I have a suggestion for you

692
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,781
Of course,you'll get your freedom,
and 5,000 crowns a year in maintenance

693
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,981
provided you spend
three months here each year.

694
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,341
Two summer months, and one month
around Christmas and New Year

695
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:04,181
And in these months
everything would be as before between us.

696
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:13,181
I would be very happy if you would
give me 2000 a year, without conditions.

697
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,501
You still wear my ring

698
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:19,061
Yes

699
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:21,301
Why should I not do that?

700
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:25,221
No,why would not you do that?

701
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,021
And yet as it has become between us
lately ...

702
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:34,381
Especially these weeks
after your Stockholm trip before Christmas

703
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:38,261
I can't have the slightest doubt
that you have fallen in love with someone.

704
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:45,581
Your conclusions may
be at your own expense

705
00:58:45,861 --> 00:58:48,621
Yes,my conclusions ...

706
00:58:49,941 --> 00:58:52,741
my conclusions and the consequences!

707
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:57,141
The obvious consequence
of your new love is-

708
00:58:57,141 --> 00:59:01,981
that you wish me dead and buried
every day and every moment !

709
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:06,861
-Am I not right?
-No but Markus

710
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:08,981
You don't have to answer.

711
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,221
But I don't want to be the reason
that one day will occur

712
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:16,221
some dangerous and criminal
thought in your dear little head.

713
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,101
I've been very much in love
with you,dear Lydia

714
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:24,021
and still I am

715
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:26,621
very much in love

716
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,181
And now you should get what you want.

717
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,581
What an idyll! Are you going to divorce?

718
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,861
Yes, we have agreed.

719
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:44,981
Congratulations. How much?

720
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,821
5000 crowns per year,
quarterly in advance.

721
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:53,141
No thanks, 2000. I don't want
more than I need for a living

722
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:55,221
But think about your reputation

723
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,141
People might think that you have
broken your marital duty

724
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:00,501
been fired with a paltry sum

725
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,301
But I don't care what people talk about.
And luxury I've never cared about

726
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,661
No but a small apartment in
Stockholm with two rooms

727
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:13,941
and included furniture,then
I've everything I could wish for

728
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:16,141
Then let me at least give
you money for the furniture.

729
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,261
I thank you for that, Markus.

730
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,661
"Dear brother Arvid! You have promised to
come out to me sometime ..

731
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:27,101
and look at my paintings. "

732
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:32,021
"You are most welcome tonight. There
will be also some..

733
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:33,941
other blokes "

734
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:38,501
"You have to stay overnight.
The last train leaves at half past twelve "

735
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:43,221
"and at that time we are enjoying
ourselves most.Your friend Hans Bergling."

736
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,541
Yes, he's not much for going to
bed at half past twelve

737
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,061
that chap Hans Bergling

738
01:00:50,141 --> 01:00:51,221
Are you planning to go?

739
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,221
Well, what do you think?

740
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:56,581
But can you take time
off from the newspaper?

741
01:00:56,581 --> 01:00:58,781
Yes, it's probably okay.

742
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:01,061
I absolutely think you should go

743
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:04,581
Would be fun for you to
come out and get a bit of variety

744
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:06,581
Well, maybe

745
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:10,861
Well, then I'll go

746
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,981
Cheers, Brother Bergling.

747
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:22,141
Think about when I wrote that letter

748
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:25,021
then Hans Bergling became almost
a living person for me.

749
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:29,301
-How does he look like?
-He is small and stocky

750
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:32,021
He has thick black brushy hair

751
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:35,621
Gray-yellow hanging mustaches
and a lot of paint smudged on the vest.

752
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,721
Shouldn't you give him
a pointed beard too?

753
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:41,461
No,it doesn't fit at all for his type!

754
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:43,541
As you wish

755
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,181
Imagine being so fake!

756
01:01:51,101 --> 01:01:53,101
Yes, that's not normal.

757
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,741
Love one woman,
and be married to another.

758
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,581
It's a life which at most
could be excused if I were a poet.

759
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:03,501
A poet is excused
for just about anything

760
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:05,781
Nobody is a case unless wanting to

761
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:10,441
Poets are considered
less sane people

762
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,841
Have you ever loved your wife?

763
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,101
I have loved her in a Lutheran way.

764
01:02:22,461 --> 01:02:24,301
What is that?

765
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:30,461
Dr. Mårten Luther had almost
four hundred years ago the opinion-

766
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:33,301
-that true love
arises of itself between

767
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:39,261
spouses when they do the
deeds of nature and love with each other.

768
01:02:41,241 --> 01:02:43,461
And there may be a grain
of truth in that,possibly

769
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:46,021
but not much.

770
01:02:46,621 --> 01:02:47,741
No not much

771
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:53,901
By the way, according to Luther, love
only belonged in marriage.

772
01:02:56,141 --> 01:03:01,381
Outside of marriage ,
it was not love but fornication.

773
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:03,421
All sorts of ugly things

774
01:03:06,401 --> 01:03:09,181
You may love me in a pagan way.

775
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,941
-Lydia
-Yes

776
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:34,501
I was thinking of something
when I went here.

777
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:36,061
What were you thinking?

778
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:40,981
I thought, is it really
that impossible

779
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:44,421
that you and I may one day live
and grow old together?

780
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:50,061
That I might one day die
with my head in your sweet lap?

781
01:03:52,581 --> 01:03:55,541
You have a wife
that you love in a Lutheran way.

782
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,561
I may well be divorced
from her in the future

783
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:03,341
Right now it's not possible,
it would look too bad

784
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,461
Her father has been wealthy
but is ruined

785
01:04:07,481 --> 01:04:08,981
Yes, I've told you that

786
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:10,041
Yes,yes

787
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,041
I haven't asked for anything else.

788
01:04:14,381 --> 01:04:16,361
We have to adapt ourselves as we are.

789
01:04:16,401 --> 01:04:19,001
As long as it can't be changed for us

790
01:04:20,341 --> 01:04:22,221
I'm glad I got my name back

791
01:04:22,221 --> 01:04:23,381
And myself

792
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:30,061
It is as if I have regained something
that I have lost or neglected.

793
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,561
Did you see my nameplate on the door?

794
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,261
Lydia Stille.

795
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,341
Nothing more and nothing else.

796
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:44,141
And other things should
never be on my door either

797
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,061
Neither Roslin, Stjärnblom
or anything else.

798
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,581
I don't pay much attention to
a name on a door

799
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,221
-but I sometimes dream
of a future for the two of us.

800
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,741
and you're not doing that

801
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,181
I love you.

802
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,061
Now you get to blow on it, blow on

803
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:28,461
It was fun to
see you in a good mood!

804
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,541
It's been a long time since
you were seen laughing

805
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:32,061
My dear, I'm so busy all the time.

806
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,221
-Emma
-Yes,my Lady

807
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:34,941
Now you have to go and drink chocolate.

808
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:49,941
Imagine yourself,
music reviews, foreign editing!

809
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:52,781
And every now and then a whole
evening with your friend Hans Bergling,

810
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,101
well then, I know that.

811
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,141
Maybe we should have binged a little less.

812
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,981
I don't grudge you that

813
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,041
Listen,speaking of him,should
we not invite him here ?

814
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:05,981
Yes, maybe we should

815
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,621
You know, a pretty weird
guy, that Bergling

816
01:06:12,381 --> 01:06:15,161
He only cares about two things
in this world: painting and drinking.

817
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,581
In a family he would be unhappy!

818
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:20,421
Oh my God,but then it's
not worth us inviting him, is it?

819
01:06:20,421 --> 01:06:21,661
No, I don't think so either

820
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:23,621
By the way, I have so
much else to do.

821
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:25,621
Yes, the summer break  is a concern

822
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:28,541
Yes, but it was kind of
your father to ask me and the girls

823
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:29,901
to stay with him all summer, huh?

824
01:06:29,941 --> 01:06:31,941
It's just fun for
him to have you with him

825
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:34,681
He is well alone on his farm, of course

826
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:35,981
No,I don't think so.

827
01:06:35,981 --> 01:06:38,941
An old forest officer is used
to having nature as his best friend

828
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:40,141
Yes of course

829
01:06:40,141 --> 01:06:41,861
But in any case it will be fun

830
01:06:44,821 --> 01:06:47,441
No, I don't have time with you!
I am so busy

831
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:48,501
Emma

832
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:57,081
But it was really your fault that
I didn't keep my word to my husband.

833
01:06:57,301 --> 01:06:58,401
Yes?

834
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:03,461
I had just read your wedding ad
and I also wanted to live once

835
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,501
-And you kept your ring on?
-Why not?

836
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,981
Illusion and happiness it was
one of Markus's favorite ideas.

837
01:07:10,981 --> 01:07:14,981
I applied it on him
and let him keep his illusions.

838
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,781
It lasted a long time?

839
01:07:20,741 --> 01:07:22,221
No, hardly a year.

840
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,261
Why did you tell this today?

841
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:29,761
Because I met him yesterday.

842
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:34,221
I couldn't understand at all
that I had ever loved him.

843
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,261
What are you thinking about?

844
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:46,581
Nothing

845
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,641
Something that
I am not allowed to know.

846
01:07:51,261 --> 01:07:52,261
No

847
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,781
I was thinking of something
that once might come

848
01:07:56,381 --> 01:07:58,301
And what yet not is, nothing is

849
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,581
You must not think such
ugly stupid thoughts

850
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:04,901
Not today!

851
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,661
Don't you see where we are?

852
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:10,821
Can't you see the water?

853
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,461
It's Lake Mälaren.

854
01:08:15,021 --> 01:08:16,501
It's not Lake Mälaren

855
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,901
It's Taunitzer See.

856
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,421
What does it stand for?

857
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,261
I have to learn Russian.

858
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:40,701
A foreign editor who can't
read Novoye Vremya, it's a scandal

859
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:42,561
Then how do you manage?

860
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:46,521
I have a young man I've placed who comes
up and reads the newspaper once a day

861
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:50,381
-His name is Kaj Lidner.
-Kaj Lidner

862
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:54,701
A deeply depressed young man.
25 years more or less.

863
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,421
At that age, everyone is
probably depressive

864
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,501
But it's a beautiful name he has

865
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:03,381
Kaj Lidner

866
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,541
Well, was there anything
in Novoye Vremya today?

867
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:14,661
Not much.

868
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,761
But

869
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:20,181
Here I have translated a piece
that might interest you

870
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,301
-Yes, why not ...
-But ..

871
01:09:30,441 --> 01:09:32,901
you can easily decide to
delete my comments.

872
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,341
No. No, by all means.

873
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,501
Mr Lidner has strong sympathies
for the opposition, I understand?

874
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:42,621
Anarchist,perhaps?

875
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:49,381
Yes, you have to be something
while you wait for the end.

876
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,981
Why wait?

877
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:55,901
Mr Stjärnblom is right.

878
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:00,981
It would be better to take your own
life. If you only had a decent pretext.

879
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,901
That wouldn't be difficult to produce.

880
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:08,181
That you are poor and
that you are starving yourself

881
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,821
I don't call that a
decent pretext.

882
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:14,781
No, there are undeniably better pretexts

883
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:16,501
Yes

884
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,261
Thank you, thank you, Mr Lidner.

885
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,901
Oh, is that you ...

886
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,341
I've told you not to come
to me other than I'm waiting for you

887
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:11,821
Could have someone here visiting,
yes Ester Roslin or someone else.

888
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,761
It's something special today.

889
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,421
My father is ill.

890
01:11:19,701 --> 01:11:20,781
He might die.

891
01:11:22,221 --> 01:11:23,581
I have to go to him.

892
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:25,981
Forgive me.

893
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,461
Forgive me for speaking
so harshly to you.

894
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:41,061
You should never speak harshly
to the person you are in love with.

895
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,661
Is your father very ill?

896
01:11:55,821 --> 01:11:57,861
Yes, it looks like that.

897
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,741
He is 74 years old, and he has never
been to bed before in his whole life.

898
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,941
Oh really

899
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:09,701
Yes, then you must go.

900
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,661
When are you going?

901
01:12:15,141 --> 01:12:16,141
Tomorrow morning.

902
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,741
That was all with that dream.

903
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,741
I had enjoyed myself so much

904
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:41,661
that we should have this short
summer to ourselves.

905
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,301
Only the two of us...

906
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,061
My dear...

907
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:58,361
We'll see each other again.

908
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,301
You never know.

909
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,461
No one prevails over life and death.

910
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,301
But I don't know what else
would separate us?

911
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:31,621
Don't go! Not now, not tomorrow.
Wait a while and see if it is necessary.

912
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,061
I'm sure your wife is
exaggerating your father's illness

913
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:35,221
to attract you

914
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,981
Her letter is simple and factual

915
01:13:40,281 --> 01:13:42,681
Don't make an impression of
exaggerations or other motives.

916
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:47,981
Just the fact that Dad is in bed
shows that it is serious

917
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,001
Yes, yes, the duty above all.

918
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,141
You go!

919
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,141
Goodbye!

920
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,261
Goodbye.

921
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:08,741
Arvid

922
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:13,101
We should not be separated this way?

923
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:20,941
Do you want to stay with me tonight?

924
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,661
Certainly.

925
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:31,761
As we have had it this summer,
we'll never get it again.

926
01:14:32,461 --> 01:14:34,301
-Never again
-Lydia

927
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:38,541
When you come home again, you have
your wife and children with you.

928
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,221
And you have your work and your comrades

929
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:45,301
A whole world that is closed to me.

930
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:50,821
And the day will come when I will be
more trouble for you than joy.

931
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:56,381
But Lydia! I'm leaving,
but I'll be back!

932
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,941
I love you!

933
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:04,261
Why should we not love each other
always, always?

934
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:05,821
Of course

935
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,101
Always, always!

936
01:15:10,101 --> 01:15:11,981
Or at least until tomorrow morning!

937
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:29,101
Here, where I lie,
I see through the window-

938
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,261
-how the Plough travels backwards
as usual.

939
01:15:35,801 --> 01:15:36,801
It means...

940
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:43,941
... that I myself am moving forward
in comparison with the Plough.

941
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,421
All movement is relative.

942
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,821
My dear boy ...

943
01:15:57,021 --> 01:16:00,141
I'm afraid you're weak for women.

944
01:16:03,741 --> 01:16:07,641
Yes, it doesn't need to dishonor
a man-

945
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,301
-but it can drag him down-

946
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,141
-break his path

947
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:20,061
and close his way.

948
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,821
Arvid I have belonged to another man,
while you were away.

949
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:44,301
I felt so lonely, and I constantly
saw you together with your wife.

950
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:46,061
This is over now

951
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:48,341
I wanted you to know before we meet again

952
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:50,821
I couldn't have told you verbally
Lydia

953
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,901
Who was it?

954
01:17:10,981 --> 01:17:15,421
Well, I've deceived and been deceived

955
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:20,141
I have deceived my wife with you
and you with my wife.

956
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:25,541
The only thing missing from the symphony
is that my wife is deceiving me

957
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,801
Even then do I have the right to complain

958
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,421
Admittedly, I had imagined that which
was between you and me

959
01:17:37,421 --> 01:17:38,981
would be something special

960
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:41,141
something unique

961
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:46,261
something outside retaliation
laws and such baseness!

962
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:51,701
And of course, I didn't think when I
buried my old father

963
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:55,261
in the small cemetery of my hometown on
a quiet September day-

964
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,621
-that you were out
on gallant adventures at the same time!

965
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,461
But you have to accept everything.

966
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:06,701
I have to take it as we are

967
01:18:06,701 --> 01:18:10,221
But one thing, dear Lydia,
I want you to bear in mind...

968
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,061
In the case of a woman's lovers

969
01:18:15,061 --> 01:18:17,981
you usually apply the arithmetic
of the Australian Negroes

970
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:23,141
You only count to three.
And any addition is called many.

971
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,941
Thank you, that's enough.

972
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:31,501
Yes, that should be enough.

973
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:36,341
I was prepared for
reproaches but not for this

974
01:18:36,661 --> 01:18:37,661
Really

975
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:39,981
You were prepared for reproaches

976
01:18:41,941 --> 01:18:43,821
It surprises me
that you did not expect praise.

977
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,101
Lydia!

978
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,021
What do you want from me?

979
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:56,421
A woman with gallant adventures on
her conscience can't be something for you

980
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,741
Gallant adventures

981
01:18:59,741 --> 01:19:04,701
What do you call it yourself?
You wrote that it was not love

982
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:08,661
No,it was not love

983
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:11,341
but neither the other.

984
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:16,021
Don't think about it now.

985
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,421
Who am I to judge you?

986
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,261
Actually, I've already forgiven you

987
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,821
Thanks

988
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:28,821
I have no use for your forgiveness .

989
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:33,061
You will never see me as a
repentant Magdalena

990
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:39,341
And never again will you see me
as a horrible beggar of love at your door!

991
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,101
Thank you, that's enough,you can leave now.

992
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,781
I want to be alone.

993
01:19:47,801 --> 01:19:48,801
Lydia

994
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:53,701
Never look for anything more from me.

995
01:20:36,261 --> 01:20:38,341
Lydia
This can't go on.

996
01:20:38,981 --> 01:20:42,541
I surrender to your mercy

997
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:45,741
I can't think of living without you.

998
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:48,541
You didn't want my pardon.

999
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,381
You scoffed it.

1000
01:20:50,381 --> 01:20:51,701
But I want your forgiveness.

1001
01:20:51,701 --> 01:20:53,061
Forgive me. Arvid

1002
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,829
Arvid ...

1003
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,589
I thought I saw you from my window

1004
01:21:23,289 --> 01:21:25,189
but I was not sure it was you

1005
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,169
Come up with me.

1006
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,109
No

1007
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:33,789
You've delayed too long.

1008
01:21:34,609 --> 01:21:37,169
You've been torturing
me too cruelly and for too long.

1009
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:38,789
Forgive me.

1010
01:21:40,189 --> 01:21:42,809
You came when
I saw you getting so desperate

1011
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:48,509
This is the last time I ask you,
if you say no now ...

1012
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:14,749
At least show him
the mercy of extinguishing the lights

1013
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:18,229
So he doesn't have to see
lights in your window

1014
01:22:18,329 --> 01:22:21,273
when he goes down to the
cemetery and stares here

1015
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,709
He has probably already 
seen the lights by me

1016
01:22:32,609 --> 01:22:34,509
 It's better that way.

1017
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:40,309
Best that he once and for all got
it definitely that I am gone for him.

1018
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,829
Thank you for coming.

1019
01:24:24,469 --> 01:24:26,229
I didn't dare to ask you.

1020
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,869
I was so afraid of a no.

1021
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,989
It was a beautiful funeral.

1022
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:43,189
So it was him?

1023
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,029
Oh he did the right thing!

1024
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,749
I wish I could do like him.

1025
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:58,789
Lydia ... Dear Lydia ...

1026
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:05,069
What have I done?
He was so kind ...

1027
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:13,189
There are many nice boys, and
you can't play with them all.

1028
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:06,349
”Arvid!" Lydia...

1029
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:15,749
"I belonged to another man
while you were away."

1030
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,829
"I felt so alone."

1031
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:29,989
"I saw you constantly in front of me
with your wife."

1032
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,909
So you're still up?

1033
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:57,869
How are you? Are you ill?

1034
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,749
I happened to open the secret drawer
in the chiffonier

1035
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,629
Now you know how it is

1036
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:19,009
And you imagine I'm going to
accept that you are having a mistress

1037
01:27:19,549 --> 01:27:22,929
No, dear Dagmar,I haven't thought
of it,even for a moment

1038
01:27:23,949 --> 01:27:25,489
I sincerely wish,on the contrary,

1039
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:27,309
that you don't want to put up with it

1040
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,249
but filing for divorce
as soon as possible

1041
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,709
Divorce? What do you mean?

1042
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:38,269
Dear Dagmar,you must not have
really understood what it is like

1043
01:27:40,029 --> 01:27:41,349
I love another

1044
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,309
Who deceives you, yes!

1045
01:27:45,629 --> 01:27:47,189
And you forgave her ...

1046
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:50,649
That may not be the right word.

1047
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:53,929
It's too much to sort it out.

1048
01:27:55,909 --> 01:27:57,589
But I don't want a divorce.

1049
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:02,309
You've been unfaithful to me,that's
ugly enough of you

1050
01:28:04,229 --> 01:28:06,429
If you don't choose that it can be forgiven

1051
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:09,309
Forgiveness implies
repentance and improvement.

1052
01:28:10,669 --> 01:28:12,389
I can't promise neither one
nor the other.

1053
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,949
Don't cry, Dagmar.

1054
01:28:37,029 --> 01:28:39,029
I'm not worth that much crying.

1055
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:43,029
I beg your pardon

1056
01:28:44,529 --> 01:28:46,669
Would you take the
forgiveness in that sense?

1057
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:48,709
It's because I've hurt you

1058
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:53,929
Maybe we both have
something to forgive each other

1059
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:55,609
before we now part.

1060
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,549
What do you mean?

1061
01:28:58,349 --> 01:29:00,509
-Have you heard anything about me?
-Not at all.

1062
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,429
I'm thinking about that with
our secret engagement.

1063
01:29:04,989 --> 01:29:06,389
Yes? What's the matter with it?

1064
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,189
You knew very well
that I didn't want to get married

1065
01:29:10,789 --> 01:29:13,189
You tricked me into
marrying against my will.

1066
01:29:15,749 --> 01:29:18,869
A marriage that begins in that way
must always be a little fragile.

1067
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:24,589
Why would I open
that miserable box

1068
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:28,909
If I had not done it,
then everything would have been as before

1069
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,369
My dear,it couldn't have gone on like this

1070
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:35,429
Everything must have an end.

1071
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,709
At least tell me who she is.

1072
01:29:41,549 --> 01:29:42,789
Can you believe such a thing?

1073
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:46,989
I'll probably find out.

1074
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:50,429
Your Lydia may not
be that difficult to track down

1075
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,549
Lydia is a signature.

1076
01:29:55,309 --> 01:29:57,709
In reality, she is called something
completely different.

1077
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,789
I'm not as stupid as you think.

1078
01:30:00,989 --> 01:30:04,069
You can greet her from
me to be careful.

1079
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,989
It's late now Dagmar

1080
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:09,389
Shall we not say good night?

1081
01:30:11,569 --> 01:30:13,189
I'm lying here on the couch tonight.

1082
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:20,589
By all means, I'll not stop you
from sleeping. If you can sleep!

1083
01:30:23,949 --> 01:30:24,949
Good night

1084
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:54,889
Well, you're left! That's nice
Then we can drink our night grog here.

1085
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,869
Maybe the gentlemen don't know each other?

1086
01:30:58,309 --> 01:31:00,009
They are Editor Stjärnblom and Mr. Törne.

1087
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:06,069
Ture Törne who sang so beautifully
at our friend Kaj Lidner's funeral.

1088
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:09,989
Yes, singing at a funeral is fine,
it's at least something personal

1089
01:31:09,989 --> 01:31:12,829
but by the way, it's the devil's
work being a singer and an actor

1090
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:15,709
I thought it was a profession
that completely captured a person

1091
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:20,989
In advertising, yes,
but it's a hell of a life

1092
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:23,549
I hate to sing and play theater

1093
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,909
-I want to write.
-I think so

1094
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:29,789
Write, that's the future!
Just look at Stjärnblom!

1095
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:34,229
Proofreader, music reviewer,
foreign editor

1096
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:39,589
And now Doncker has appointed him
our flying correspondent as well

1097
01:31:41,269 --> 01:31:42,412
Cheers!

1098
01:31:42,589 --> 01:31:43,589
Cheers

1099
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,389
Not bad

1100
01:31:47,189 --> 01:31:50,289
-Travel to the continent next week.
-Well? Alone?

1101
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:54,909
Don't know. We'll see.

1102
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,589
Yes, travel books are probably fine

1103
01:31:58,589 --> 01:32:02,509
but I will write theater,
I want to be a poet.

1104
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,789
One has probably several
strings on one's lyre.

1105
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:08,629
I already have a play ready.

1106
01:32:08,729 --> 01:32:09,749
Nearly

1107
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:10,949
Here you will hear.

1108
01:32:10,949 --> 01:32:14,469
What kind of theater grandiloquent
at this time? No thanks!

1109
01:32:14,849 --> 01:32:16,789
Yes, but it's not
quite finished, I say

1110
01:32:16,789 --> 01:32:18,809
You can probably only listen
to a few test pieces

1111
01:32:20,269 --> 01:32:21,509
It will be a pleasure for us.

1112
01:32:24,989 --> 01:32:27,869
The play is about a young woman, Laura
von Stieler, is her name

1113
01:32:27,869 --> 01:32:29,469
Who is married to an old man

1114
01:32:29,469 --> 01:32:33,429
Historian and philosopher,
with a great name and very rich.

1115
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:37,709
He owns a castle in Västmanland
and the first act takes place there.

1116
01:32:37,709 --> 01:32:39,909
But she doesn't love him.

1117
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:41,989
She loves a young officer

1118
01:32:42,549 --> 01:32:45,149
who,however, abhors
his murderous profession

1119
01:32:45,149 --> 01:32:46,909
and wants to become a poet

1120
01:32:48,169 --> 01:32:49,509
Her father is also in the play

1121
01:32:49,609 --> 01:32:51,669
He is a painter with a
world-renowned reputation.

1122
01:32:51,869 --> 01:32:54,989
And has a whole wall full of
paintings in the Luxembourg gallery

1123
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:58,949
Well, here we have their scene.
Laura to the man:

1124
01:32:59,389 --> 01:33:01,589
"Do you want to know the truth?"

1125
01:33:01,589 --> 01:33:02,789
He in a superior mood

1126
01:33:03,509 --> 01:33:04,949
"I don't care to know "

1127
01:33:05,269 --> 01:33:06,549
"The truth is harmful"

1128
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,709
"It's illusions and delusions.

1129
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:10,709
which is the essence of all
human happiness. "

1130
01:33:11,129 --> 01:33:12,149
Not so bad,eh?

1131
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:18,829
Not stupid at all, a very
sensible remark.

1132
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:24,349
It is on a terrace by a lake.
"Do you see the water?" she says.

1133
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:26,349
"It's not Lake Mälaren

1134
01:33:26,349 --> 01:33:28,229
"It's Taunitzer See."

1135
01:33:28,789 --> 01:33:31,549
Which is it now? Mälaren
or Taunitzer see?

1136
01:33:31,549 --> 01:33:35,069
Taunitzer see, in "Når vi döde vogner".

1137
01:33:35,069 --> 01:33:38,009
Construction my boy! You
never get that on any stage!

1138
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:46,069
Hello. Yes, I'm coming soon.

1139
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:52,149
Too much text, of course.
Just as the last print form

1140
01:33:52,869 --> 01:33:54,389
Just a moment

1141
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:01,229
"Construction"
That can be himself.

1142
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:07,149
In fact, I made Laura
right after a living model.

1143
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:10,589
I can just imagine that.

1144
01:34:12,029 --> 01:34:15,509
But don't ask me what her name is.

1145
01:34:15,509 --> 01:34:17,089
You never betray a lady.

1146
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,549
Sure, of course not.

1147
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:24,269
We've had a relationship with
her for a month or so

1148
01:34:25,349 --> 01:34:26,769
Now it's almost over.

1149
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:30,269
But we might make a little
trip to Norway this summer

1150
01:34:32,389 --> 01:34:33,929
Is it already almost over?

1151
01:34:34,209 --> 01:34:36,129
Yes, one should beware of getting stuck.

1152
01:34:36,829 --> 01:34:38,709
You should at least
live a bit first

1153
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:51,729
But how you look! How is it?
Has anything happened to you?

1154
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:56,389
-Oh yes, in a way.
-But what is it then?

1155
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,029
Can't you speak out?

1156
01:35:01,109 --> 01:35:02,269
I'll try.

1157
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:05,789
I have heard incidentally

1158
01:35:05,789 --> 01:35:08,329
that you plan to make a short
trip to Norway this summer.

1159
01:35:09,349 --> 01:35:10,349
Well?

1160
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:12,789
Where did you hear it from?

1161
01:35:13,089 --> 01:35:15,609
Is there more than one
I could have heard it from?

1162
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:19,829
But Arvid, now get it over with
and tell me what it is!

1163
01:35:20,509 --> 01:35:21,789
There's not much to tell.

1164
01:35:24,309 --> 01:35:27,389
You're just the main character
in a theatrical play by Ture Törne

1165
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:29,829
Written according to a living model

1166
01:35:31,229 --> 01:35:33,949
The author has also had a
relationship with that model for a month

1167
01:35:35,349 --> 01:35:36,709
A relation?

1168
01:35:37,229 --> 01:35:38,349
In one month?

1169
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:43,369
He didn't mention your name.
He's a discreet young man.

1170
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:46,109
Yes, I really do know Mr. Ture Törne

1171
01:35:46,109 --> 01:35:48,429
I don't know why I
didn't tell you

1172
01:35:49,349 --> 01:35:51,929
I haven't been in a
relationship with him

1173
01:35:53,789 --> 01:35:54,829
In that case

1174
01:35:54,829 --> 01:35:58,876
then Ture Törne would be able to become
a real damned good poet for the future

1175
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,509
-Don't you believe me?
-Yes

1176
01:36:01,349 --> 01:36:02,829
Of course I believe you

1177
01:36:04,349 --> 01:36:06,269
If I may tell you the whole truth

1178
01:36:06,269 --> 01:36:10,169
so we've really kissed
each other a bit.

1179
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:13,309
And so it has become a whole play
for him!

1180
01:36:19,429 --> 01:36:24,149
Yes, as I said, he will probably become
a damned good poet!

1181
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:28,509
Arvid, you yourself have
probably understood

1182
01:36:28,509 --> 01:36:31,176
that it can't continue like this anymore

1183
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,389
But if you still care about me

1184
01:36:33,389 --> 01:36:35,869
-And don't want to lose me
-Yes

1185
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,949
Yes then you have to go through
the whole long story

1186
01:36:38,949 --> 01:36:43,069
With divorce new
marriage and everything

1187
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,909
As hitherto,it can't continue any longer

1188
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:47,989
Dear Lydia ...

1189
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:53,509
I'll be leaving here soon, and
I'll be away for a very long time

1190
01:36:55,429 --> 01:36:58,789
Yesterday I thought,
"Soon my divorce will be over."

1191
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:03,389
"Then I will ask Lydia to follow me
- now and always."

1192
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:08,849
But a piece of the moon
has fallen since then.

1193
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,589
Do you really think
this is the moment

1194
01:37:12,589 --> 01:37:14,329
is it appropriate to talk about marriage?

1195
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:16,149
Well yes

1196
01:37:17,629 --> 01:37:20,749
So I have nothing to save myself for.

1197
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,869
Where are you going?

1198
01:37:24,549 --> 01:37:26,469
I'll be the newspaper's 
traveling correspondent.

1199
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,589
When are you going?

1200
01:37:29,949 --> 01:37:31,069
In a week or so.

1201
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,349
Good bye then.

1202
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,469
Goodbye.

1203
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:07,269
I wanted to say goodbye and also
I wanted to give you a memory of me.

1204
01:38:08,929 --> 01:38:10,129
It's just a small thing

1205
01:38:11,149 --> 01:38:13,429
A thing that you may have
use for sometimes.

1206
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,949
Then maybe you'll think of me.

1207
01:38:19,469 --> 01:38:20,909
And you?

1208
01:38:20,909 --> 01:38:22,509
Don't worry about me.

1209
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,749
I've made my choice.

1210
01:38:26,749 --> 01:38:27,829
And stick to it?

1211
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:32,989
I love him
have never loved so much!

1212
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:35,309
Be seated!

1213
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:42,589
Pleasant journey.

1214
01:38:43,289 --> 01:38:44,389
Thanks

1215
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:48,869
-When is Dad coming?
-He has left.

1216
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:56,109
-When will he come back?
-I don't know. It can take a long time.

1217
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:00,429
But he's coming back.
I know he's coming back

1218
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,989
I just met him
whom I used to love.

1219
01:40:06,069 --> 01:40:09,069
and then I couldn't understand at all
that I had ever loved him.
