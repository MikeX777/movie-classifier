... will continue to experience
considerable growth.

4
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,214
In the 21st century, Japan's sky, sea
and land

5
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,539
will see our dreams harmonize
with nature

6
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,096
and will continue to experience
considerable growth.

7
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,768
In the 21st century, Japan's sky, sea
and land

8
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,218
will see our dreams harmonize
with nature

9
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,569
and will continue...

10
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,970
Humanity has taken a first step

11
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,091
In the universe.

12
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,611
The Universe is limitless.

13
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,131
The future is infinite.

14
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,976
This first step into the Universe

15
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,655
is a new step towards the future.

16
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,570
Watch your feet,
you're on the way out.

17
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,090
Watch your feet,
you're on the way out.

18
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,177
May Day Parade in Tokyo

19
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,611
Get Mr. Yamashita back to his job!

20
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,494
No to pollution

21
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,850
Comply with labor laws!

22
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,090
- Sato...
- Get out!

23
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,370
- Sato...
- Get out!

24
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,456
Security Treaty...

25
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,690
Non!

26
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,138
- Yankees...
- Go home!

27
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,251
- Yankees...
- Go home!

28
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,419
The parade continues,

29
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,050
people who scatter

30
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,774
are invited to do so
by the head of the procession.

31
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,495
Here, the Japanese Communist Party!

32
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,488
Congratulations to the 42nd gathering
of our teachers!

33
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,372
Thank you all for participating in this parade
on May 1st.

34
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,578
Here, the Japanese Communist Party!

35
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,659
The strength we show today

36
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,095
will grow more and more

37
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,416
to bring to the 70s

38
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,537
a new democratic policy and breath!

39
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,572
Health!

40
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,059
Culture!

41
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,134
Loyalty!

42
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,618
Responsibility!

43
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,739
Positivity!

44
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,813
Perseverance!

45
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,934
Gaiety!

46
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,419
Conciliation!

47
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,735
Hooray for Sato!

48
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,056
Hooray for Sanzo!

49
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,414
Satô Sanzö will win the victory!

50
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,650
Satō Sanzō can't lose!

51
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,128
Satō Sanzō will win!

52
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,778
Come on, Sato Sanzo!

53
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,729
In principle, senators

54
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,535
should be independent of parties.

55
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,812
I am self-employed...

56
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,979
Here, the Communist Party!
If you don't like us,

57
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,410
Consider this though:

58
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,135
parliament
should be a fair reflection

59
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,174
of everyone's will.

60
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,816
It should be composed in this sense.

61
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,218
The Liberal Democrat Party
won 35% of the vote.

62
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,095
and it occupies
more than half of the seats!

63
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,851
Can we speak of an
equitably composed parliament?

64
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,573
The communist party

65
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,858
is the founder of democracy.

66
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,689
Democracy also applies
to parliament...

67
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,979
Far left demonstration

68
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,334
against the Japanese-American security treaty .

69
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,976
''The International

70
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,889
''will be the human race

71
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,332
''Arise, the damned of the Earth!

72
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,657
''Rise, the convicts of hunger!

73
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,014
''Reason thunders in its crater

74
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,179
''It's the eruption of the end...''

75
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,974
The Socialist Party
and the Communist Party...

76
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,578
The policy of aggression towards Asia

77
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,015
is backed by a genuine...

78
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,616
It's up to us to check it!

79
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,819
The conservative Party...

80
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,334
''Freedom in pillars of fire

81
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,169
''Spark above our heads

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,089
''For the final fight

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,531
''Fly the flag of victory

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,972
''Stand up, comrades, let's go to battle...''

85
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,216
- Security Treaty...
- No!

86
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,695
- Let's fight...
- For victory!

87
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,096
Please move forward inside the wagon.

88
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,293
Please move further
inside the car.

89
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,137
Please move forward inside the wagon.

90
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,329
Get off lane 4.

91
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,699
The train for Tokyo is about to pull into the station.

92
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,539
The train from Ome to Tokyo
is about to enter the station.

93
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,208
To access platform 4,
please get off here.

94
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,653
Shinjuku!
Make sure you haven't forgotten anything...

95
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,095
Depart for Chiba, track 7.

96
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,970
The village school.

97
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:30,211
Bonjour!

98
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:32,325
Hello. Rest!

99
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:35,492
Today again
we will all spend together

100
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:38,005
a pleasant day.

101
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,246
In our school,
we are all equal.

102
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:47,964
If we meet a friend,
we say hello.

103
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:49,653
Can also

104
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:52,004
wish him
good luck for the day.

105
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:56,723
You have to greet with your heart
and with energy.

106
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:06,123
Junko!

107
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:08,493
Bring it here.

108
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:09,843
Non!

109
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:11,283
Bring me that!

110
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:12,609
Non!

111
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:15,286
She doesn't want to do anything.

112
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:37,484
''Generous mountains

113
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:42,085

''In a new energy''

118
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:07,608
The time has come
to make a decision.

119
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:13,685
The Pacific War
taught us peace.

120
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:18,844
A moral lesson
to live again.

121
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:37,964
''Aim high

122
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:41,689

''Don't show your tears

The 1st war
between the aviation and the navy

132
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:17,403
got involved.

133
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:32,528
Feu!

134
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:50,651
The whole crew overboard!

135
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:58,693
The crew left the ship.

136
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:02,333
You fought well!

137
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:05,446
You are worthy soldiers
of the British Empire.

138
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,970
- We must act quickly!
- Commanding officer!

139
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:11,532
No. Good luck.

140
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:15,363
Commandant!

141
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:18,644
- Quick!
- Commanding officer!

142
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:31,884
The water is hot.

143
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:38,929
Forward, Salamander!

144
00:26:42,254 --> 00:26:43,448
One! Two! Three!

145
00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:45,645
We are silent for a Sapporo beer.

146
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:18,684
On site,

147
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:23,922
all kinds of problems happen

148
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,732
related to the nature of the work.

149
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,883
Who can deliver her envelope
to Yukie?

150
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:45,607
- Me.
- OK.

151
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:46,883
Sekine Tsuru!

152
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:48,004
Oui.

153
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:52,088
Takagi, there you go.

154
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,091
Yashiro Noriko?

155
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:55,932
Yashiro Noriko is not there?

156
00:36:56,134 --> 00:36:57,965
She's a woman, right?

157
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,972
Yashiro...Yashiro...

158
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:07,607
This envelope...
It's Yatsume, right?

159
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:09,372
It's Yada.

160
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,087
Is there a Yada?

161
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:19,007
7 yens + 8 yens

162
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:21,648

173
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:53,049
Exact.

Mayor of the village

179
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,723
Farmers' sons

180
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:17,047
almost all become
salaried workers.

181
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,131
They abandon agriculture.

182
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:22,852
This is the situation we are in.

183
00:38:23,174 --> 00:38:27,167
Inevitably,
the village of Ono, within 10 years,

184
00:38:27,494 --> 00:38:30,008
finally, in about ten years,

185
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,934
will become one with Kashima.

186
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:36,410
He will have to survive with Kashima

187
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,491
in this new form.

188
00:38:38,894 --> 00:38:40,122
In these conditions,

189
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,723
these are high standing residences

190
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:46,449
that will grow,
not the agricultural village.

191
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:48,804
Despite this, agriculture

192
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:51,209
could continue in his corner.

193
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:53,245
That's what I'd like to think.

194
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:25,523
You can't build
if you don't have the money.

195
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,687
There is money here.

196
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:32,848
But the real problem is land.

197
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:36,683
Without land,
you cannot build a house.

198
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:56,688
Today,
celebrations are based on exchange.

199
00:40:56,894 --> 00:41:01,524
Before, when we celebrated a party,

200
00:41:01,854 --> 00:41:04,004
what was offered there was not given back.

201
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:06,928
Now if.

202
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:10,604
Well, that has changed a lot.

203
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:14,011
As
more and more money is given these days,

204
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:18,924
we return it as a gift.

205
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:22,570
And we'll give money
for other people's houses.

206
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,923
The sense of obligation
is still very strong around here.

207
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:30,931
It allows you to serve.

208
00:43:46,534 --> 00:43:48,365
May

209
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:53,613
that we can make a living in Kashima.

210
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:58,126
Few people have money here.

211
00:43:59,174 --> 00:44:03,690
It does not prevent them
from living comfortably.

212
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:09,008
But deep down, they suck.

213
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,647
We don't know how

214
00:44:13,814 --> 00:44:17,568
agriculture will evolve in the future.

215
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:21,848
Me, my desire is to see
my farm grow.

216
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:24,409
I will do anything for that.

217
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:27,003
But we lack resources.

218
00:44:27,254 --> 00:44:30,485
If that doesn't happen,
we can eat our crops.

219
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:34,364
But I don't know what will happen
under these conditions.

220
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:13,407
That...

221
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:17,884
it was the sum brought by a man.

222
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:23,850
Everything came from the neighborhood.
And that was family.

223
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,447
It was family.

224
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:33,973
This money went to the deceased.
There was also rice.

225
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:37,734
Those who helped
shared the rest.

226
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:39,686
But the value of things has increased,

227
00:47:39,894 --> 00:47:43,284
so today is different.

228
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:45,533
Look,

229
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:50,043
it 's my grandfather's funeral .

230
00:47:50,254 --> 00:47:53,883
And that, those of my father.

231
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:56,608
Everything is recorded at the funeral.

232
00:47:56,814 --> 00:47:58,850
The amount offered for my grandfather

233
00:47:59,054 --> 00:48:02,603
and the one offered for my father

234
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:05,248
are not the same.

235
00:48:05,454 --> 00:48:09,732
The sum offered to the deceased
is completely different.

236
00:48:10,494 --> 00:48:13,292
The value of things
kept increasing.

237
00:51:06,374 --> 00:51:08,569
Village firefighters

238
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:10,527
Go on!

239
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,013
Attention!

240
00:51:13,214 --> 00:51:15,409
Hail command!

241
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:21,046
Everyone in rows!

242
00:51:31,614 --> 00:51:32,967
Everyone listen!

243
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:37,406
Our exercise can be performed
in 1 hour.

244
00:51:37,614 --> 00:51:40,811
I planned to finish it today.

245
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:45,133
But if it doesn't go well,
we'll still be there at 10:00.

246
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,804
Dad wants a TV this year.

247
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:12,126
One color station: 150,000 yen.

248
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:14,651
Next year or the year after

249
00:52:14,854 --> 00:52:18,244
it will be a car
to replace the old one.

250
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:23,330
And maybe the next year
or even later,

251
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:26,367
he will also want air conditioning.

252
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:44,802
"If you're a man...

253
00:53:47,654 --> 00:53:50,248
“What to do in such a situation?

254
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:56,647
''Green light, are we moving forward?

255
00:53:57,374 --> 00:54:01,526
''Red light, shall we stop?

256
00:54:01,854 --> 00:54:04,243
''You all

257
00:54:04,454 --> 00:54:06,445
''You know it well

258
00:54:06,654 --> 00:54:11,170
''And yet

259
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,609
''We can't stop

260
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:19,009
''The path of love

00:54:19,574 --> 00:54:24,409
''For this pretty young girl

00:54:24,654 --> 00:54:29,170
''I will walk through fire and water

263
00:54:29,454 --> 00:54:31,888
''You won't stop me

264
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:37,532
''Maman

265
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:54,204
''If we are a man!''

266
00:58:28,414 --> 00:58:30,405
I defer to you

267
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:33,174
and, with all my heart,
I ask for your support.

268
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:38,849
People of Ono, vote for Arai Manabu.

269
00:58:39,694 --> 00:58:42,208
Arai Manabu! Arai Manabu!

270
00:58:42,414 --> 00:58:44,609
I count on you!

271
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:48,449
My name is Arai Manabu.
My name is Arai Manabu.

272
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:52,329
Arai Manabu is counting on you!

273
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,131
Thanks! Thank you from the heart!

274
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:23,767
I count on you!

275
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:33,007
We count on your advice,
your support

276
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:36,968
and your cooperation.
We are counting on you!

277
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:41,804
His name is Ogawa Genichi
and he's counting on you!

278
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:46,565
This Kashima election campaign
will be broadcast

279
01:00:46,774 --> 01:00:50,767
tonight at 9:30 p.m.
on the general channel of NHK.

280
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:53,932
Don't miss this program!

281
01:00:55,214 --> 01:00:59,492
He will be the politician
dedicated to the prosperity of Ono.

282
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:01,846
With you he will build

283
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:06,730
a new Kashima where it will be good to live.

284
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:08,686
To all,

285
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:12,883
we ask for your support.

286
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:17,722
In Japan,
parties are worth nothing in politics.

287
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:21,690
Our elections are changing

288
01:01:21,894 --> 01:01:24,454
in donations of alcohol or money.

289
01:01:24,654 --> 01:01:29,409
Especially if you appeal
to a sense of obligation.

290
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:33,766
You don't win elections without it
in Japan.

291
01:01:33,974 --> 01:01:36,169
Especially in regional elections,

292
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:39,772
in small groups, everything is settled

293
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,648
by a sense of obligation.

294
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:47,407
This is what regulates elections
and work.

295
01:01:47,814 --> 01:01:51,011
The sense of obligation
is a tradition in Japan.

296
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:56,284
But it would disappear
in the event of a citizen revolution.

297
01:01:56,694 --> 01:02:01,768
The obligation is not a system
in itself.

298
01:02:02,454 --> 01:02:04,968
In today's Japan,

299
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,848
we have capitalism,

300
01:02:09,494 --> 01:02:11,405
appearances of a democracy,

301
01:02:11,614 --> 01:02:13,969
so that the political parties

302
01:02:15,054 --> 01:02:17,090
do not have recourse
to the sense of obligation.

303
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:19,732
But for the regional elections,

304
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:23,722
the obligation takes precedence
over the feeling of entitlement.

305
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:27,451
It's the perfect example.
They take advantage of it, that's all.

306
01:02:30,694 --> 01:02:33,572
Said like that,
it's closer to reality.

307
01:02:33,774 --> 01:02:36,447
The obligation disappears
from government business.

308
01:02:37,174 --> 01:02:41,326
The politics of the PS
and that of the PLD are vague,

309
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,885
but we almost understand.

310
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:48,963
So we vote PLD, PS or PC.

311
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:51,813
For that, it works.
But it does not work

312
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:56,530
at the scale of villages
and small towns.

313
01:02:57,214 --> 01:03:01,173
Today, at the level of the prefectures,

314
01:03:01,454 --> 01:03:02,967
it's a big problem.

315
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:06,173
We need citizens
who wake up

316
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:08,683
to destroy such a system.

317
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:13,687
People change little by little.

318
01:03:14,014 --> 01:03:17,643
We still need
50 or 100 years of history.

319
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,891
The PC makes between 200 and 300 voices.

320
01:03:20,094 --> 01:03:21,766
PS,

321
01:03:22,414 --> 01:03:26,327
between 2,300 and 2,500 votes.
Always the same result.

322
01:03:26,614 --> 01:03:28,889
Whoever the candidate is, it's the same.

323
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:33,452
In Kashima, political consciousness

324
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:35,133
is very weak.

325
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:39,243
We wonder
on what criteria to choose.

326
01:03:40,334 --> 01:03:42,290
Myself, I don't really know.

327
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:45,207
Bonjour.

328
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:49,292

if we wait to be polluted

357

as is the port of Tokyo,
it will be too late.

358
01:11:28,894 --> 01:11:31,852
In the words of Prefect Iwakami,

359
01:11:32,574 --> 01:11:34,405
Kashima mining

360
01:11:34,854 --> 01:11:37,687
has been accepted.

361
01:11:38,734 --> 01:11:41,567
To these words,
I reply that it is not so.

362
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:45,723
Kashima exploitation
is not accepted!

363
01:11:46,894 --> 01:11:50,204
Look at the situation of the fishermen.

364
01:11:50,574 --> 01:11:52,963
The sea is dirty

365
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:55,449
by waste and oil.

366
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,452
Fish are inedible.

367
01:11:57,654 --> 01:11:59,884
That's where we are in Kashima.

368
01:12:00,374 --> 01:12:02,569
No to pollution!

369
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:05,767
Prefect Iwakami promises us

370
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:09,967
that there will never be pollution.

371
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:12,452
But you all know it,

372
01:12:12,734 --> 01:12:15,771
the sea is already polluted
with oil and waste

373
01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:19,091
and the inhabitants of the Kamizu district

374
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,569
live as neighbors

375
01:12:21,774 --> 01:12:23,605
of this oil dump.

376
01:12:23,854 --> 01:12:25,765
The noise it generates

377
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,852
was measured at 75 phons.

378
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:33,725
All I want
is pure water.

379
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:36,813
If I had pure water, it would be fine.

380
01:16:38,254 --> 01:16:40,484
Did you tell them what's going to happen?

381
01:16:41,654 --> 01:16:42,973
Did you tell them?

382
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:45,770
They understand nothing.

383
01:16:47,054 --> 01:16:49,204
What did you tell them?

384
01:16:49,414 --> 01:16:52,133
You are not deaf!
Do you only talk to your wife?

385
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:54,894
I'm a woman,
me too, I don't have a penis!

386
01:16:55,454 --> 01:16:57,763
Let's take off our panties. We are going to fight.

387
01:16:58,454 --> 01:17:00,206
Take off your panties and I take off mine.

388
01:17:00,414 --> 01:17:01,529
Are you ready?

389
01:17:04,294 --> 01:17:07,445
Two against one,
sure I can win!

390
01:17:10,534 --> 01:17:14,652
What are you going to do
if the water is polluted?

391
01:17:15,614 --> 01:17:18,048
What will you do?

392
01:17:18,454 --> 01:17:19,603
Are you responsible?

393
01:17:20,294 --> 01:17:23,525
Yes or no?

394
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:25,248
Hey! You!

395
01:17:25,894 --> 01:17:27,566
What are you going to do?

396
01:17:28,974 --> 01:17:30,248
Are you not responsible?

397
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:33,412
Are you not responsible?

398
01:17:36,414 --> 01:17:37,403
Poor jerk!

399
01:17:39,374 --> 01:17:42,252
Go home!

400
01:18:00,254 --> 01:18:02,768
Farmers and students

401
01:18:02,974 --> 01:18:07,650
in front of the agents
of the public works company

402
01:18:21,174 --> 01:18:23,483
The Elderly Action Group,

403
01:18:23,694 --> 01:18:27,448
they are wealthy grandfathers
and grandmothers.

404
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:32,611
They could stay quietly
at home.

405
01:18:32,894 --> 01:18:35,692
That's what they want to do,
after all.

406
01:18:35,894 --> 01:18:37,850
But now is not the time

407
01:18:38,534 --> 01:18:41,844
to stand there
blowing their grandchildren's nose.

408
01:18:42,214 --> 01:18:45,570
Among them, there are some who have already

409
01:18:45,774 --> 01:18:47,366
one foot in the grave.

410
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:50,772
But they decided to be young.

411
01:18:51,174 --> 01:18:54,086
As young
as student activists.

412
01:18:55,054 --> 01:18:57,773
Kurosawa is the leader of this action.

413
01:18:58,454 --> 01:19:01,048
He's young.
I call him ''the young Kurosawa''.

414
01:19:02,094 --> 01:19:03,891
Kurosawa came to join us.

415
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:06,485
We had to meet.

416
01:19:06,694 --> 01:19:09,333
As
he approached the guards,

417
01:19:09,534 --> 01:19:13,243
Kurosawa took a 20-liter barrel

418
01:19:13,654 --> 01:19:16,407
filled with that familiar yellowish shit

419
01:19:16,614 --> 01:19:18,411
and threw some at them with a ladle.

420
01:19:19,934 --> 01:19:20,764
Voilà!

421
01:19:21,174 --> 01:19:23,369
What do mobile guards do?

422
01:19:23,574 --> 01:19:25,769
They went to find Kurosawa.

423
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:28,090
They took their truncheons
and hit him.

424
01:19:28,294 --> 01:19:32,412
They knocked him down
and strangled him.

425
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,764
Kurosawa has energy,
he got up.

426
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:37,694
They put a rope
around his waist.

427
01:19:37,894 --> 01:19:41,204
They took him away
in handcuffs.

428
01:19:41,414 --> 01:19:44,008
He said

429
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:48,887
that he wouldn't speak without a lawyer.

430
01:19:49,734 --> 01:19:52,407
The brigade leader was annoyed.

431
01:19:52,614 --> 01:19:55,367
What to do with an old caker?

432
01:19:56,814 --> 01:20:01,763
Well, old Kurosawa
came back with dignity at 9:30 a.m.

433
01:20:02,054 --> 01:20:03,567
on the places where we are.

434
01:20:03,774 --> 01:20:06,004
With a leader
like him for our action,

435
01:20:06,214 --> 01:20:08,603
no more petty peasant conflicts.

436
01:20:09,174 --> 01:20:11,529
The revolution will take place in Japan!

437
01:20:12,214 --> 01:20:14,045
imperialism and capitalism

438
01:20:14,254 --> 01:20:18,133
will be overturned
to their very foundations.

439
01:20:18,774 --> 01:20:20,844
We need to.

440
01:20:21,454 --> 01:20:23,524
We have to fight!

441
01:20:23,734 --> 01:20:25,406
The peasants will fight.

442
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,929
They will, trust me.

443
01:20:28,654 --> 01:20:31,452
This is neither drivel
nor a sermon for kids.

444
01:20:31,654 --> 01:20:34,646
I'm not talking to you to talk
nonsense.

445
01:20:59,014 --> 01:21:01,892
Some groups of students
see the workers

446
01:21:02,214 --> 01:21:03,852
like enemies

447
01:21:04,054 --> 01:21:06,568
because they are building the airport.

448
01:21:06,934 --> 01:21:09,892
This way of looking at the situation
is widespread.

449
01:21:10,094 --> 01:21:12,324
But reasoning like this

450
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:17,130
it is playing the game
of monopoly capitalism.

451
01:21:17,334 --> 01:21:19,131
And they fall into the trap.

452
01:21:19,454 --> 01:21:23,413
Construction workers
are different from each other.

453
01:21:23,894 --> 01:21:26,089
Some struggle

454
01:21:26,294 --> 01:21:29,923
while driving
the machines and bulldozers.

455
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:31,726
Yes, there are some like that.

456
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:34,323
There are also
seasonal workers.

457
01:21:34,534 --> 01:21:36,684
Those of subcontracting companies

458
01:21:37,014 --> 01:21:38,970
who, in case of conflict,

459
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:42,769
stand on our side.

460
01:21:44,214 --> 01:21:46,170
Today,

461
01:21:46,374 --> 01:21:49,366
society and capitalism
are full of contradictions.

462
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:55,053
Seasonal workers
have no means of action

463
01:21:55,254 --> 01:21:57,290
and they are not unionized.

464
01:21:57,814 --> 01:22:00,567
They are however very numerous.

465
01:22:00,774 --> 01:22:02,571
How to be heard?

466
01:22:02,774 --> 01:22:07,131
What form of action is possible?

467
01:22:07,614 --> 01:22:11,527
We must seek
our own means of action.

468
01:22:28,494 --> 01:22:32,248
''Reason thunders in its crater

469
01:22:32,454 --> 01:22:36,129
''It's the eruption of the end!

470
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:40,043
''From the past, let's make a clean sweep,

471
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:43,803
''Slave crowd, stand up, stand up!''

472
01:25:29,934 --> 01:25:31,333
All of you workers!

473
01:25:31,734 --> 01:25:34,726
We have
no resentment towards you.

474
01:25:35,254 --> 01:25:37,563
We ask you today

475
01:25:37,974 --> 01:25:40,932
to refuse to work
even if ordered to do so.

476
01:25:42,094 --> 01:25:43,288
We are counting on you.

477
01:25:47,174 --> 01:25:50,530
Stop contributing
to the killing of peasants.

478
01:25:52,974 --> 01:25:55,852
We are innocent peasants,

479
01:25:56,054 --> 01:25:57,248
we don't ask

480
01:25:58,174 --> 01:26:00,768
only to continue to live in safety.

481
01:26:03,094 --> 01:26:05,210
We're about to

482
01:26:05,414 --> 01:26:09,646
to be forcibly removed from our lands.

483
01:26:10,134 --> 01:26:10,805
Now,

484
01:26:11,854 --> 01:26:15,608
we are determined until death,

485
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:17,532
until they are buried.

486
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:19,369
You all!

487
01:26:20,374 --> 01:26:22,524
Face reality
and look at us.

488
01:26:22,734 --> 01:26:26,124
Our bodies are attached,
tied to our fortress.

489
01:26:26,334 --> 01:26:29,212
We will protect her until the end!

490
01:26:29,414 --> 01:26:33,168
We will go to the end
of our action.

491
01:26:33,414 --> 01:26:36,372
If you leave,
our action cannot...

492
01:26:36,574 --> 01:26:38,929
Do not prevent our action
from taking place.

493
01:26:39,134 --> 01:26:40,408
The mobile brigades

494
01:26:41,014 --> 01:26:42,288
no more!

495
01:26:42,934 --> 01:26:44,845
Be all our allies!

496
01:26:45,054 --> 01:26:46,407
Thanks a lot.

497
01:27:15,294 --> 01:27:18,331
far-right party.

498
01:27:19,254 --> 01:27:21,848
It's completely ridiculous!

499
01:27:22,974 --> 01:27:25,488
In time of war, we do not send

500
01:27:25,694 --> 01:27:28,413
women and children
on the battlefield.

501
01:27:28,814 --> 01:27:30,964
Yet that is what
these fools do!

502
01:27:31,294 --> 01:27:33,250
Send women and children

503
01:27:33,454 --> 01:27:36,207
is a good tactic.

504
01:27:36,934 --> 01:27:38,333
The police men

505
01:27:38,814 --> 01:27:41,374
would not touch
women and children.

506
01:27:41,574 --> 01:27:45,328
With a strong government,
the dispersal would be orderly

507
01:27:45,814 --> 01:27:48,886
and these guys would go to jail for
2 or 3 years.

508
01:27:49,454 --> 01:27:52,526
In China or in the USSR,
which they admire so much,

509
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:55,328
we wouldn't let them.

510
01:27:56,174 --> 01:27:59,644
They would be killed
as counter-revolutionaries!

511
01:29:01,614 --> 01:29:03,969
This way! Quick!

512
01:29:11,414 --> 01:29:13,564
Let's prevent the raid!

513
01:29:19,694 --> 01:29:20,968
Let's prevent it!

514
01:29:23,254 --> 01:29:25,165
We will fight until victory!

515
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:28,046
Mobile guards, go home!

516
01:29:29,254 --> 01:29:31,085
Mobile guards, get out!

517
01:29:32,214 --> 01:29:34,205
We will fight until the end!

518
01:29:35,934 --> 01:29:37,970
We will fight until victory!

519
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:43,562
We will fight!

520
01:29:46,894 --> 01:29:51,604
''Our world stands
on a fortress

521
01:29:51,814 --> 01:29:55,443

No at the airport!

529
01:33:54,494 --> 01:33:56,724
Go home!

530
01:35:04,014 --> 01:35:05,606
Assassins!

531
01:35:28,094 --> 01:35:29,812
You despise people

532
01:35:30,014 --> 01:35:31,447
and you run them!

533
01:35:35,014 --> 01:35:38,211
Get out of there, it's too dangerous!

534
01:35:40,094 --> 01:35:41,891
A comrade is dead!

535
01:35:55,894 --> 01:35:58,806
Watch what you are doing! Stop!

536
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:04,612

the life of the peasants!

It's in loyalty
and in all honesty

549
01:37:07,574 --> 01:37:09,565
that our partners and we,
the prefecture,

550
01:37:09,774 --> 01:37:12,766
we were determined to move forward

551
01:37:12,974 --> 01:37:16,046
and to join forces
in order to achieve this result.

552
01:37:16,774 --> 01:37:19,572
This result that we are celebrating today

553
01:37:20,014 --> 01:37:23,165
brought us great progress.

554
01:37:23,374 --> 01:37:26,491
I don't know how to tell you
how much

555
01:37:27,574 --> 01:37:32,523
I am deeply grateful to you.

556
01:37:33,574 --> 01:37:35,371
In times to come,

557
01:37:36,214 --> 01:37:38,682
we will have to face

558
01:37:38,894 --> 01:37:41,249
to great difficulty.

559
01:37:41,454 --> 01:37:44,093
But the questions
we need to think about

560
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:46,850
as human beings

561
01:37:47,054 --> 01:37:50,285
touch directly on harmony

562
01:37:50,494 --> 01:37:52,849
between Nature and Man.

563
01:42:57,094 --> 01:42:59,608
middle classes,

564
01:42:59,934 --> 01:43:03,847
the small industrialist,
the small merchant,

565
01:43:04,174 --> 01:43:06,483
the craftsman, the peasant,

566
01:43:06,814 --> 01:43:10,523
all fight the bourgeoisie

567
01:43:11,174 --> 01:43:14,883
to safeguard their existence

568
01:43:15,214 --> 01:43:17,728
middle classes under threat.

569
01:43:18,054 --> 01:43:21,967
They are therefore not revolutionary.

570
01:43:22,294 --> 01:43:24,603
but conservative.

571
01:43:24,934 --> 01:43:29,246
Moreover, they are reactionary,

572
01:43:29,574 --> 01:43:33,487
since they seek
to demote

573
01:43:33,814 --> 01:43:35,805
the wheel of history.

574
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:40,412
But they are revolutionary

575
01:43:40,734 --> 01:43:45,285
insofar as they provide

576
01:43:45,574 --> 01:43:48,486
that they will melt

577
01:43:48,814 --> 01:43:51,487
in the proletariat.

578
01:43:51,814 --> 01:43:54,931
So they don't defend

579
01:43:55,454 --> 01:43:59,288
their current interests

580
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:02,294
but their future interests.

581
01:44:02,774 --> 01:44:08,406
They give up
their own point of view

582
01:44:08,894 --> 01:44:13,809
to take that of the proletariat. ''
