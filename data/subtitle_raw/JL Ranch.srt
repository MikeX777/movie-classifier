00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,800
JL RANCH

2
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,800
Good morning, chickens.

3
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,400
We have to talk, Dad.

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,240
Hope this ain't a conspiracy
to keep me from my breakfast.

5
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
We're just trying to save you
from yourself.

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,960
And we're running out of time.
I could use a quiet breakfast.

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,120
Okay, me first.

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
As long as I get my say.

9
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,240
Fine, you won't let us save you,
then let us save this ranch.

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,880
You sound just like your mother.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,080
Don't change the subject!

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,880
-The Bed and Breakfast.
-Oh, Rebecca.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,480
-What?
-We've been through all this.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
No is the answer, no.

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,680
What exactly do I do here, Dad?

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Remind me, what explicitly
is it that I'm in charge of?

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
It's Lynnie comin' home today?

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
-No.
-Lynnie coming...

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,520
-Got youon a knife's edge.
-Lynnie's coming home?

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
It's the finances, Dad.
I'm supposed to help us

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,160
keep from going under and under
is exactly where we're going.

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,800
I can't control the weather, honey.

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
The drought doubled hay prices,

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,560
dropped our margin down to nothin'.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,360
I told you not to buy that new tractor.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,280
How was I to know Jimmy T.
was gonna bail,

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
leave us with the full weight?

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,000
A ranch is full of risks.

29
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,360
-We'll ride this out.
-Couple of months, Dad...

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
And we're not gonna be able to
afford to feed our own stock.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,520
Regan, are you on board
with this B&B nonsense?

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,080
That cedar house
is your family home.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
Yeah, I know, Daddy,

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,120
and that's why
I have an alternate proposal.

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,320
-I am never gonna get my breakfast.
-Okay, listen.

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Regan and Jerry can afford
their own house, Dad.

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,600
I drove nails, girls,

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
in that porch
when I was eight years old.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,840
I'll make the decision who lives
in that house.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,880
This is an asset
that we need to exploit, okay?

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,920
The B&B can help us
create a brand

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,120
that we can monetize.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,440
The only brand we need
around here is the one I put

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,840
on the hind end of a calf.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
-Good morning, Grandpa.
-Oh, here we go.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
We got eggs.

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Yeah, breakfast. Thanks, boys.

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,560
He had ol' blue eyes up
with the chickens.

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,200
Now look, Daddy, you're right.

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,480
The cedar house is my home
and I don't intend to leave it

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
but we don't need to turn our ranch

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,160
into an amusement park.

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
There's another way to get even.

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,200
Are you listening to me?

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,200
All right. All right, Regan, what is it?

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,120
Sell Parcel 14 or maybe Parcel Six...

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
and we wipe out our debt.

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,320
Those parcels are our land...

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
which we ain't sellin'.

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,960
I know that you mean well, Regan,

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,160
but selling dirt is a one-time solution.

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
Hey, it's not gonna generate
any income after that.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,920
What if we need money again?
What are we gonna do?

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
-Jerry proposed to me in that house.
-Oh, here we go.

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,680
And my babies took
their first steps inside it.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,640
You know, the only thing holding
you and Jerry back

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
is dad's generosity.

68
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
This could be the best thing
that happened to both of you.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,120
You know, it's easy for you
to talk about bootin' me

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,320
and my children out of our home,

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,680
because your own daughter
won't even...

72
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,280
Don't even, don't even go there.

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,400
Daddy, where are you goin'?

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,720
Daddy, come on back here
and eat a proper breakfast, please.

75
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,880
I will make it for you.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
It's all good.

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,560
You never listen.

78
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,040
Good morning, Grandpa.

79
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Hey, Ty.

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
What are you grinning at?

81
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,280
Nothin' like a hearty breakfast
to start the day. Huh, boss man?

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,240
You got a sadistic aspect.

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,680
Are you aware of that?

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,800
What did you have for breakfast?

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,280
Some of my wife's perfect little,

86
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,800
beautiful chilaquiles, yeah.

87
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,840
I ain't interested.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,280
Let's go. Haw!

89
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,680
Go. Go.

90
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,880
Keep your eye on Big Redhead.

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm on it, John.

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,520
Yeah, I see
that ol' trouble maker, John.

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Round 'em up.

94
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,800
Come on, boys, round 'em up.

95
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
Haw!

96
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,920
When Rebecca gets something
in her craw...

97
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,840
boy, she keeps chewin' on it
and chewin' on it.

98
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Just a little swelling. No abscess.

99
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
Oh, that's good. Here.

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
But Regan stood right up to her,

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
toe to toe this morning.

102
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,040
Yeah, I don't think Rebecca's ideas
are half bad, though.

103
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,200
So, she got to you behind my back?

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
No.

105
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,640
No, no, I'm neutral like Canada.

106
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,880
-Besides, none of my business.
-Yeah.

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,480
Switzerland.

108
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,720
Neutral like Switzerland.

109
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,800
John! Hector!

110
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Wolf!

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
That's it, that's it now.

112
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,000
It's $50,000 fine
if you kill a wolf, John.

113
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,640
Wolves cost me
more than that this past month.

114
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,080
Yeah, but it's the law.
You used to be sheriff, didn't ya?

115
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,320
Back then,

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,320
the law was closer to common sense.
This ain't that.

117
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,640
-Where is it, Tio?
-Tree line.

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120
Some of them wolves
are tagged, John.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Think about it.

120
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,160
You'll have Parks and Wildlife
all over you like stink on pigs.

121
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Get outta here!

122
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,600
I see you again,
I'll make you into a coat.

123
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,320
Hey, how ya doing there?

124
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
All right, sir.

125
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Darn it!

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,480
-Sorry about that.
-That's alright.

127
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Yeah.

128
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,320
There's your county.

129
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,240
Some people still hunt their food.

130
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,480
Yes, sir.

131
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,720
Anyways...

132
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,440
this land I was talking about was...

133
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Well, the boundary...
It starts just about right here,

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,960
this fence and it goes
north and west

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,800
all the way
that Forest Service firebreak.

136
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes, sir, we'll get
the boundaries to the Capitol

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,760
by the end of day.

138
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Well, gosh darn. I sure appreciate
that extra work, Frank.

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
-Yes, sir.
-That is Frank, isn't it?

140
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
-Yes.
-See, I knew that 'cause...

141
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,480
one of the boys said you'd meet a guy,
Frank, who's got a...

142
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,800
a wedding anniversary
coming up soon, is that right?

143
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,800
-Nine years, nine years.
-That's the man.

144
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,040
Not too many people respect

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
that institute of marriage anymore.

146
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Here you go.

147
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
Mr. Peterson, sir...

148
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,800
My daddy was Mr. Peterson,
my name is Tap.

149
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
Tap, sir, I can't take this.

150
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,480
Listen, let me tell you
something. I...

151
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,000
I enjoy giving gifts
to people I respect,

152
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,520
and what I will not like is
if you don't spend every dime

153
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,000
of that on that young lady.

154
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Yes, sir.

155
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,920
See this, this land back here
it all belonged to my family.

156
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,320
In time, it was stolen from us.

157
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,840
I mean, you could understand

158
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,440
how an old man would feel about that.

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Yes, sir.

160
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,400
Well, I appreciate your work.

161
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,200
I look forward to seeing you again.

162
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,400
Far cry from the big city, I guess.

163
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,400
Never been myself.

164
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,920
I don't like the traffic.

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,600
I guess that's kinda funny,
a driver who don't like traffic.

166
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,600
But that's why everybody calls me.

167
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
See I know all the backroads,
all the shortcuts...

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,640
Do you mind?

169
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,080
I haven't been home in years,
so I would like to spend

170
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,880
some quiet time with my thoughts.

171
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,880
-Yes, Ma'am.
-Thanks.

172
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,960
I will have one of the guys

173
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
put it in your pickup.

174
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,240
Thank you, sir.

175
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
All right.

176
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
Makings of a fine spread.

177
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,800
Now what is the occasion?

178
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
None of your business,
Ethan Peterson.

179
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Thank you.

180
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,080
Speaking of business, Rebecca,

181
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,400
how are things at JL Ranch?

182
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,360
Never better. Thanks for asking.

183
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,040
Yeah, that's a welcome surprise.

184
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
-Is it now?
-Yeah.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
'Cause Daddy and me...

186
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
we heard different.

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,040
Well, you must have manure
in your ears.

188
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,840
As well as in between 'em.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,480
Excuse me, Ethan.

190
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,560
Oh, boy.

191
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,480
Same ol', same ol'.

192
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Have a seat.

193
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,320
Morning, Miss Rebecca.

194
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,560
Sheriff, is there a problem?

195
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,800
Yeah.

196
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,680
Tail light's out.

197
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,280
No, it's not.

198
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
No, it's not.

199
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,880
What do you want, Henry?

200
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,680
I heard Lynnie was comin' home today.

201
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,280
Yeah, well, you never know with Lynnie.

202
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Where'd you hear that?

203
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,200
I got my connections.

204
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,680
I might not be quite as stealthy

205
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,520
as your dad was when he wore
the star, but I get around.

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440
I bet she's been
through some changes.

207
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
School and all, city life.

208
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
You must be excited.

209
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm scared to death.

210
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,880
You? Scared?

211
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,400
From what little she did say to me,

212
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,040
it's looking like she wants to open

213
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,440
things up about her dad,
maybe seek him out.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well...

215
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,840
only natural, I guess,
after all this time.

216
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,080
Yeah, well, make one big mistake

217
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
and it just follows me,
and follows me,

218
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,200
and follows me, you know?

219
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,040
You have always been a loving mom.

220
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,160
I'm sure Lynnie can see that...

221
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
now she's older.

222
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,680
No, your real mistake
was choosing him over me.

223
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Please, you weren't even
in the picture then, Henry.

224
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,120
-Shut your face.
-Well, in my heart I was.

225
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Always.

226
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,080
What'd your dad say about it?

227
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,880
Oh, you know him.

228
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,600
Never says more
than there's necessary.

229
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,200
"All will work itself out."
That's what he always says.

230
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm a good sounding board
if you need one.

231
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,720
Thank you, Henry.

232
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
I appreciate it. I wish there
was something you could do.

233
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,040
Try me.

234
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
I gotta get going.

235
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,800
Don't you have a job to do
or something like that?

236
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,920
Okay. Well...

237
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,880
I'm gonna let you off
with a warning this time.

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,760
-Okay.
-You just remember...

239
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,880
I'm always watching those tail lights.

240
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,440
Get outta here, Henry.

241
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,640
Hello? Anybody home?

242
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Hello?

243
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Anybody home?

244
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Grandpa?

245
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Howdy.

246
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,280
Who are you?

247
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
My name's Terrence.

248
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,280
Lookin' for John Landsburg.

249
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,680
I need a job.

250
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,000
And you just walked
into this house?

251
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Yeah.

252
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,760
What's the matter with you?

253
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,320
Didn't your parents
teach you manners?

254
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,720
Nah, they weren't around much.

255
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
Well, if you're looking
for my grandfather,

256
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,600
step out there
and the first hand you see,

257
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,680
ask them where the office is
and then wait.

258
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,920
Might it be a long wait, Miss...

259
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,000
John Landsburg's granddaughter.

260
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,640
And it could be all day.

261
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, John Landsburg's granddaughter,

262
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,400
it just so happens I got all day.

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,800
Cowboys.

264
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,000
-Hey, John, Lynnie's here.
-Who said that?

265
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,760
I just dropped her off this morning.

266
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,440
-She at the house?
-That's what I heard.

267
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,440
-Hey, Lynnie!
-Grandpa.

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
Hey, kid, how ya doing?

269
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
-Hey, Grandpa.
-Hey, honey.

270
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,320
-Oh, it's good to have you home.
-I missed you.

271
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,240
You got your same room waitin'.

272
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,400
-Yeah?
-It ain't been touched.

273
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
Hope you're going
to stay a little while.

274
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,760
-Hey, Hector.
-Hey, girl.

275
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,560
There's a man waitin' for you
by your office.

276
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,760
Says he's lookin' for work.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
He walked right into
your kitchen without askin'.

278
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,400
Well, ain't that nice.
There's your mother.

279
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
Go to her.

280
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,040
Go to her, Lynnie.

281
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
I'll take that, Miss Landsburg.

282
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,840
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, girl.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,680
Didn't think you'd make it.

284
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,720
Seemed like it was time.

285
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,480
Well... come here.

286
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,560
She looks good.

287
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
All grown up.

288
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Yup.

289
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Howdy.

290
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,480
Enterin' my house
without permission.

291
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Layin' about.

292
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,840
Not the best way
to get yourself a job,

293
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
if that's what you're lookin' for.

294
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
You must be John Landsburg.

295
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
That's right.

296
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,960
Ever worked a gather before?

297
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,480
-Let's talk inside.
-Won't be necessary, sir.

298
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Mr. Landsburg,

299
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,840
you been served.

300
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Served what?

301
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
Well, ain't you a little snake.

302
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,640
Sorry to be
the bearer of bad news.

303
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,480
I mean that.

304
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,840
Get out of here, son.

305
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
Go back where you came from.

306
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,440
How can they take private property

307
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,400
that's bought and paid for?
They can't, can they?

308
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,200
We need to see the deed.
Where is it?

309
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,880
I don't know, I'll look around.

310
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,280
All right, you find it.

311
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Thanks, Paul.

312
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,640
I'll call when I know more.

313
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,080
Hey, Grandpa. Mom said dinner
will be ready in half an hour

314
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,920
if you wanna go get washed up.

315
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,360
Is everything all right?

316
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Fine, honey.

317
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,320
Especially now that you're home.

318
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,480
I'll... I'll make myself pretty.

319
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,480
Uncle Brady.

320
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
Hey there, City Lights.

321
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,840
Long time. You grew up real nice.

322
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,240
-Lynnie!
-Aunt Regan.

323
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,040
Hey. Hey, bud!

324
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
-Hi, Tyler.
-I'm so happy you're home.

325
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Hi, Hayden. Who is this?

326
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,280
-That's Devin.
-Devin, you've gotten so big.

327
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Careful, Devin.

328
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,200
City girls are known to be
a little tricky.

329
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,920
-Dinner's ready.
-Grandpa.

330
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,280
-Careful now.
-Oh, watch out.

331
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
Easy does it.

332
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,640
Because they were two shellfish.

333
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,880
-I didn't find that funny at all.
-Let me ask you,

334
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
has anybody been paying
attention to Devin.

335
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,440
Go easy on the collective us.

336
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,880
...you gotta build that muscle.

337
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Grandpa, I gotta say the ranch
looks as good as the day I left.

338
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,120
Thank you, Lynnie.

339
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Boys...

340
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
I remember

341
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,840
when your cousin Lynnie
roped her first deer.

342
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,480
Oh, yeah?

343
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,720
It dragged her through the mud
for about 50 yards.

344
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,520
If Becca hadn't yelled to let go,

345
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,640
she'd still be hanging onto that rope.

346
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
How old were you?

347
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,280
I don't remember.

348
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,640
Nine, maybe?

349
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,240
She let loose, jumped up,

350
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,720
stood straight up,

351
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,360
proud as can be, ran to her mother,

352
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,160
wrapped her muddy arms around her.

353
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,920
She was a dirt ball.

354
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,440
Stubbornest little girl I met.

355
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,280
Probably take after my father.

356
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,840
Not that I ever met him.

357
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
What do you think, Mom?

358
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Would you call my father
a stubborn man?

359
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,360
How come you hardly ever visit?

360
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Busy, Devin.

361
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,800
I like living in the city,

362
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,720
traveling and I had
a heavy course load in college.

363
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,760
So, why was it you stayed away
for so long?

364
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,560
Your big sister knows why.

365
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,160
Past is the past.

366
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
You're home now.

367
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,280
And that's all that matters.

368
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
I'll drink to that.

369
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,800
-Here, here.
-Water, I hope.

370
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,680
Absolutely. Nothing
but for the past 13 months.

371
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,240
-Good boy.
-Hey, it's great.

372
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
Good for you, son.

373
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,120
-Thanks, Pops.
-Good boy.

374
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,320
-Cheers.
-Good work.

375
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,240
When your great grandma
and grandpa...

376
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,200
Nellie and Jeremiah, when they first...

377
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,920
saw this land, they said,

378
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,040
"This is the most beautiful
place on God's earth."

379
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,400
There was almost nothin' here then.

380
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,960
No roads to speak of.

381
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,360
And they... they built...

382
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,160
this little stone house.

383
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,560
And that's how they survived
the first winter in that house.

384
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,640
They survived storms of all kinds and...

385
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,480
and fires, predators.

386
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,640
And they brought the first calves

387
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,840
up into this area.

388
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,320
Little by little...

389
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,200
they made this ranch.

390
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,280
They saw it was good and they said,

391
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,440
"This is for our grandchildren
and their children."

392
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,680
They passed it down to us.

393
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,480
I've seen some of the world, Lynnie,

394
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,480
in the service and such.

395
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,360
I ain't never been happier

396
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
much anyplace else.

397
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,720
I don't have to go nowhere.

398
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Now...

399
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,520
Who wants some pie?

400
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,120
I do.

401
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,600
I know you do.

402
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
I want some pie.

403
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,120
I know it's not my business, sugar.

404
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,600
You're right, Aunt Regan,

405
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,880
it's not your business.

406
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
Go easy on your mother.

407
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,320
This is hard on her, too.

408
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,800
Hey, guest of honor doesn't do dishes.

409
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,920
What's going on here?

410
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,480
Just showing my appreciation.

411
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,280
By all means, carry on then.

412
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,920
Well, you can take over for me.

413
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,800
I can do that.

414
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Thanks, Regan.

415
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
You...

416
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,720
look good, Lynn. Beautiful.

417
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,040
Don't bother.
It's not a happy place for me.

418
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,480
I don't want to be here
any longer than I have to be.

419
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
All right, then why are you here?

420
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
What do you want?

421
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,320
You know what I want.

422
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,160
We have been over this 1,000 times.

423
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,280
Your father took a walk
long before you were born

424
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,560
and hasn't been seen since.
Biggest mistake of my life.

425
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,280
My father was a mistake?

426
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,960
A mistake that led

427
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,600
to the greatest blessing of my life.

428
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,040
That doesn't cut it, Mom.

429
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
It didn't when I was a kid,
and I'm not a kid anymore.

430
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
No, you're not.

431
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,520
Honey, you are a beautiful,
young woman.

432
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,160
Just stop with the down-home syrup.

433
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,200
I got enough of that
with Grandpa's speech.

434
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Hey, girls.

435
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,520
Lynnie, you must be tired
from your trip.

436
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,360
You better get some shut eye.

437
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,600
Chores start at 04:30.

438
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,920
What are you talking about?

439
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
No freeloaders here, darlin',
you know that.

440
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,640
You gotta pull your weight.

441
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,480
You'll get paid a fair wage
like everyone else.

442
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,760
Sundays off for church.
Say good night to your mother.

443
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,600
She and I got some business
to attend to.

444
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,960
Go on, sweetie.

445
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
-Cut a trail to bed.
-Good night. Mom.

446
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Night, Lynn.

447
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,680
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

448
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,560
Hey...

449
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,520
give it a couple of days.

450
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,480
Let's get some air.

451
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,080
That kid today...

452
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
served me with papers

453
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,320
from the Bureau of Homeland
Management.

454
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,680
They're trying to seize a chunk
of our ranch.

455
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
What?

456
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,720
How are they gonna do that,
eminent domain?

457
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,880
They have to make an offer,
set a court hearing.

458
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,160
They say they're not renewing
our lease.

459
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
What lease?

460
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,480
We don't lease. We own
every inch of this property.

461
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,840
I know. That's what I don't get.

462
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,000
What part of the ranch
are they talking about?

463
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,960
107.6631 West.

464
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,560
That's Parcel 14.

465
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,040
The southwest side.

466
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Butcher Hill.

467
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
Where the big well is.

468
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,840
Yeah, the big well.

469
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,360
That well recharges the ponds,

470
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,040
provides all the water for the ranch.

471
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,800
And half the others in the valley
during drought times.

472
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
So...

473
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,160
that's what this is all about.

474
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,960
Water.

475
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
Oh, thanks, man.

476
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Hey, darlin'.

477
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,600
Wanna come give her a try?

478
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Go on now.

479
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,720
She was rejected by her momma,

480
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,640
so if we don't get a bottle in her soon

481
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
we might lose her.

482
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
As I remember,

483
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,440
you had a way with the cows
when you were little.

484
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Okay.

485
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,440
All right now, come on, sugar.

486
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
That a girl, that a girl.

487
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,680
That a girl. Easy, easy.
Okay.

488
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
That a girl.

489
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,320
Pack it in, Lynnie.

490
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,880
You put in a good day's work.

491
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
How did it feel?

492
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,360
I'm going to go into town,
you wanna come?

493
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
No, I'm wiped.

494
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,960
-Okay.
-All right.

495
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,960
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you, honey.

496
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,440
-Grandpa, Grandpa...
-Hey, kid.

497
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,400
-Grandpa.
-Take it easy, take it easy.

498
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,120
What is it, champ?
Just slow down, take a breath.

499
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,680
I got a B on my report card.

500
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,920
Dad says he's taking us out

501
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,240
to rejoice at the impossibility.

502
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,760
I don't know what that means.

503
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,040
That means work well done,
that's what it means.

504
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,400
Congratulations, Son. Here.

505
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Yeah.

506
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,920
Dad said you have
a meeting in town.

507
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,520
Yeah, a long boring meeting.

508
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,920
Why don't I give you a ride?

509
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,600
We'll take my truck.
Go tell your daddy.

510
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Can we talk?

511
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
-About what, honey?
-I don't know.

512
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,400
Something's goin' on.
I wanna know about it.

513
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,480
Let me finish up
and I'll get back to you.

514
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,000
-Daddy...
-Nothin' for you to worry about.

515
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,920
I know grandpa's ready
because he has his rifle.

516
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,600
Why do you got your gun, Grandpa?

517
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
Well, ain't we huntin' for tacos?

518
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,880
You don't hunt for tacos, Grandpa.

519
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
You don't?

520
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,240
What do you do with them
squirrelly creatures?

521
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
-You eat 'em.
-Eat 'em.

522
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,160
Oh, boy. Get in. Get in the truck.

523
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,040
-Come on, guys. Buckle up.
-Everybody in.

524
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,320
-Grandpa?
-Yeah, Ty?

525
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,440
Why do you bring
your rifle everywhere?

526
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Well, Ty, nature's unpredictable.

527
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,880
Most days are calm,

528
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,840
but you should always
be prepared for storms.

529
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Besides...

530
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,920
we got precious cargo on board.
Ain't that right, Jerry?

531
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,400
I don't know about precious.

532
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,720
Well, they ain't too ugly.
Get in there.

533
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,480
All right, everybody in?

534
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,600
Would you tell me the truth
if I asked you to?

535
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,960
Yes, always.

536
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,600
There's something going on
with Daddy

537
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,200
and he won't tell me what it is.

538
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,240
You have to ask him, Regan.

539
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
But he told you.

540
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,880
I deal with a lot of things
on this ranch that don't involve you.

541
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,160
Nah, this is my home, too.

542
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,880
The Bureau is trying to take
Parcel 14,

543
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,480
and they say that our lease is up,

544
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,760
and it's not to be renewed.

545
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,040
I thought we owned all this property.

546
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,880
We do which is why
it doesn't make any sense,

547
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,520
but the big well is on that block.

548
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Wait, what?

549
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,000
The big well is on 14?
I thought it was on nine.

550
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,520
No, it used to be on nine,
but when we granted the easement

551
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,240
to the Forest Service
for the firebreak,

552
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,680
the boundaries shifted.

553
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,160
Well, I didn't know that.

554
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,520
Well, the point is
the big well is on 14.

555
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,080
We lose 14, we lose our water.

556
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,080
Well, it's all
some bureaucratic snafu, right?

557
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
We're gonna find out.

558
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
But you can't say anything
to anybody, you hear me?

559
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,000
Why would I say anything?

560
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm hungry.

561
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,800
Martha, hi, how are you?

562
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Honey...

563
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,880
Where's my bundle?
Here we go.

564
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,560
Here we go.

565
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,480
I want a quesadilla
with extra cheese.

566
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,080
Well, you earned it.
This is your night.

567
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm getting five.

568
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,080
Hey, one quesadilla at a time,
young man. Come on.

569
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Hi, Mom!

570
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,680
Hi, baby.

571
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
What was that?

572
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Did you tell her?

573
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,720
Yeah, she took it pretty hard.

574
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,160
Check and see if anybody else
had been served.

575
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,400
I'm gonna do one thing
with the kids and I'll join you.

576
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Okay, you tell Mabel I said hey.

577
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,600
Don't get cute.

578
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Hey, John.

579
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,760
I want you to do
something special for Devin.

580
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,320
-Oh.
-Little... Little celebration.

581
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,880
How about a sundae,

582
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
with some rainbow sprinkles on it,

583
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
some whipped cream, cherry.
I'll pretty it up nice.

584
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,520
-That'll do it.
-John Landsburg.

585
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,280
Aren't you even gonna say hello?

586
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
Laura Lee.

587
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,800
I haven't seen you in town
for a while, Laura Lee.

588
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,960
Yeah well, technically
I'm still a resident.

589
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,920
I believe I can come and go
as I please.

590
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,680
Well, I ain't pryin'
into your personal.

591
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,600
And you retired
as sheriff of this town

592
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,520
a while back, didn't you?

593
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,480
-Peace.
-Come, sit down.

594
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,320
Come on, sit down.

595
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,440
Well, maybe for a second.

596
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,080
So, I hear you're having
a little trouble with your land.

597
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Is that so?

598
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,840
Where'd you hear that?

599
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,400
Well, you know me,
gossip is my middle name.

600
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,760
But if there's nothing going on,
then I didn't hear anything.

601
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,200
-Things aren't so bad.
-Really?

602
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,400
I'm happy to hear that.

603
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
I do care about you, you know.

604
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,560
Well, this is something
of a reversal.

605
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,160
You puttin' aside hostilities.

606
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,120
Well, you know,
that was the echo of old times.

607
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,240
Yeah, sometimes those echoes
can be tricky.

608
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,120
Our echoes were pretty tricky.

609
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,960
So, how's your parents' house doing?

610
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,000
Tap Peterson's interested
in takin' it off my hands.

611
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,600
You and Tap are talkin' business?

612
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,240
You gotta go where the money is.

613
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,440
I was thinking of selling
some land myself.

614
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Really?

615
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,880
Maybe to the Bureau.

616
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,160
-Really?
-You have any connections there?

617
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,920
Why would I have any connections
at the Bureau?

618
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
Well, you always seem to know...

619
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,600
all the players.

620
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Can't help you.

621
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm late.

622
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Okey-dokey.

623
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,920
Nice to see you, Laura Lee.

624
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,920
Nice to see you, John.

625
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,280
Evening. How are ya?
How you doing?

626
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
How are ya, sweetie.

627
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
You see Tap working the room?

628
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I ran into Laura Lee Schaefer
at the Hash.

629
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,560
That harpy.

630
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,520
Every time I think
of the two of you together...

631
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Well, don't think about it then.

632
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,280
She seemed to know our troubles.

633
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,960
-How?
-Got me.

634
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
But she told me

635
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,720
that Tap's interested
in buying her parents' place.

636
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,480
She's never gonna sell that.

637
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Maybe not.

638
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,320
But Tap, the Bureau, Laura Lee,

639
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,840
I think it's all connected somehow.

640
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,680
-Really?
-I got a feeling.

641
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,840
Hey.

642
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,800
I'd like to call this meeting to order.

643
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,120
Look, I've sent pictures,
I've sent vet bills,

644
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,760
I've even sent 'em fur samples
and all they ever tell me

645
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,360
is the wolves are protected.

646
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,960
Don't worry, they're not gonna
listen to you. Nobody else does.

647
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,080
Are we going to be reimbursed
for our losses or not?

648
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,520
Not as long as the greenies
are in bed with the feds.

649
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Which they are.

650
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,600
-That's right.
-John, you've had wolf trouble,

651
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,240
would you like
to speak about that?

652
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
Well, I believe that we should

653
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,200
get this whole valley
declared a wolf sanctuary

654
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,800
and put in for eight-figure subsidies.

655
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,400
Pencil me in for some of that, John.

656
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,920
Yeah? Well, give me your number.

657
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,520
But, you know, we had this,
this Senator Archer.

658
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,880
I don't know what he's doing
down in Washington, D. C.

659
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
behind that desk.

660
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,080
I'll tell you what he's doing, zero.

661
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,320
Well, he should be out here
with his constituency

662
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,520
seeing what we're faced with.

663
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
What do you think, Tap?

664
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,400
The governor's your golfin' buddy.

665
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, he was but...

666
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,560
last time we played I beat him
like a red-headed stepchild.

667
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,800
He won't pick up my calls anymore.
But I tell you what.

668
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,920
I do have some friends there

669
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,160
and I guarantee I will
get in touch with some of 'em.

670
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,560
You're going to take care of that?

671
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,480
I just said I would.

672
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,440
Any other business to come
before the meeting?

673
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,760
You all know what happened
in Washoba County.

674
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,480
The Bureau came in there
and condemned three ranches.

675
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,960
Eminent domain, whatever that is.

676
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,040
And all the ranchers in that area,

677
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,880
they all folded...

678
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,240
just stepped back, let em' take it.

679
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,080
That ain't gonna happen here.

680
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
No way.

681
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,360
We gotta stick together

682
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,720
or they'll take
the whole valley from us.

683
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,160
-Absolutely.
-That's right.

684
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,760
Anybody here been approached
by the Bureau recently?

685
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,320
The Bureau wouldn't come down here

686
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,960
and try to pull any of that stuff.

687
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
They know better.

688
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Meeting adjourned.

689
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Okay. Will see you.

690
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Tap.

691
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Yeah?

692
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,400
Can I have a word?

693
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
What do you need?

694
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,280
Has the Bureau
of Homeland Management

695
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,640
approached you in any way?

696
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,880
Been by your place?

697
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Nah.

698
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Yours?

699
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,720
What do you know, Tap?

700
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,680
I believe that I know...

701
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,600
that you're about to get
what you got coming.

702
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Oh?

703
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,600
Yeah, see, you know

704
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,360
funny thing about getting old...

705
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,840
the past sometimes fades,

706
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,880
but sometimes it gets a little stronger.

707
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,840
And the bad thing about that

708
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,280
is that you can't do
a darn thing about it.

709
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
But you are doing something
about it now.

710
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,720
Yes, sir, I am.

711
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,240
That land...

712
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,120
you're about to lose...

713
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
the land your grandfather stole
from mine.

714
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm going to do everything
I possibly can...

715
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,040
to get that land back.

716
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,320
No Landsburg ever stole a thing
from a Peterson

717
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,160
and you know as well as I do

718
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,880
that your grandfather
sold that land to the government

719
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,960
and my grandfather
bought it from them fair and square.

720
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,360
No, he leased it.

721
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,520
The deed to that property

722
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,800
has been in my family
for 100 years.

723
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,040
Hundred years.

724
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,600
If it was that simple, I imagine

725
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,800
all you have to do
is just show me that deed.

726
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
You're lookin' for trouble,
aren't you, Tap?

727
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,720
I was born for it, John.

728
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,360
A lot of people don't know that.

729
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,240
But I know...

730
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,400
that you do.

731
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,160
Hey, boys, what's the good word?

732
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,960
Just...

733
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,480
couple of good ol' boys just...

734
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,000
lying to each other
like they usually do.

735
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,120
You take care, buddy.

736
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,120
Sorry to bust that up.

737
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,240
Looked like you were getting ready

738
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
to have a bit of a good go.

739
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,440
There'll be another time.

740
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,360
-Thanks, Flo.
-I'll take one of those, Flo.

741
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Seat taken?

742
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,840
It is now.

743
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
What?

744
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,000
I still remember the first time
I saw you drink a beer.

745
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
-Oh, yeah?
-County Fair.

746
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,800
It was the year you won
the barrel race at the rodeo.

747
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,840
You were a sight to behold, girl.

748
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,080
So strong, graceful.

749
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
And so much younger.

750
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,560
You're still
a beautiful woman, Rebecca.

751
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,880
All right.

752
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
All right.

753
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,480
So, how's things with Lynnie?

754
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
My goodness, how do you think
things are with Lynnie?

755
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
No idea she was going
to be so angry.

756
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
You should come clean with her,
Rebecca.

757
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
It'll be better for you both
in the long run.

758
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,720
Oh, you think so?

759
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,920
I know so.

760
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,840
Well, thanks for that, Doc.
I appreciate that.

761
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,240
No charge.

762
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,480
You've been very good to me, Henry,
you know that?

763
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,280
We should do something fun.
What do you say?

764
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,120
Riding or I don't know.

765
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
Anytime.

766
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,160
I got an ice cream
with rainbow sprinkles, Grandpa.

767
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,200
Rainbow sprinkles, holy smokes.

768
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,840
Did you get...
get any sugar in that?

769
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,920
-Yeah.
-Yes?

770
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800
That's no good.
Here, double up.

771
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
-Sit on your brother.
-Get up there.

772
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,480
-Sit on me.
-All right, squeeze in.

773
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,600
I ran into John Landsburg tonight.

774
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,480
Oh, good. Were you drivin'?
I hope it was that big truck.

775
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,800
It's a little late
for being funny, isn't it, Tap?

776
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,760
What can I do for you, honey?

777
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,480
I don't think that you should
go through with this.

778
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,080
Oh, you don't think
I should go through with it?

779
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,360
No, it's not going to end well.

780
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,760
I thought that you
and John were...

781
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,240
were done.

782
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,360
It is.

783
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,840
It's just that if John doesn't know

784
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,320
what's going on now,
he's gonna know real soon.

785
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,960
No worries, sweetie,
he already knows.

786
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
I told him to his face today.

787
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,520
Why would you do that?

788
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,400
Listen, let me explain
something to you.

789
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,280
When my grandfather

790
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,200
lost that land with the water on it...

791
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,680
it tore the man apart.

792
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,520
And he got a bit drunk...

793
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,560
and then he went ahead

794
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,720
and torched down
every building on the property.

795
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,720
And next, thrown in jail.

796
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,880
My family just got robbed.

797
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,360
And now I... I got a chance
to make things right.

798
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,160
And there's nothing
that John Landsburg can do about it.

799
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,960
And for you, my dear,

800
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,640
you'll get your money
when the deal is done,

801
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,800
but you gotta
keep that mouth of yours shut.

802
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Is that understood?

803
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,720
What kind of beers
you got on tap?

804
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
We got Red Rocket,
Cutthroat Porter,

805
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,040
and Black Tooth on tap

806
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,640
or the list of bottles on the menu.

807
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,920
You don't remember me, do ya?

808
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,040
Can't say I do. Should I?

809
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,560
Happens all the time.

810
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,760
I go places with Clarence

811
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,800
and nobody ever looks at me.

812
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,320
Well, I can't blame them.
You know Clarence,

813
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,520
he leaves an indelible impression.

814
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,080
You remember him, right?

815
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,320
Big fella,

816
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,960
fancy boots.

817
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
What can I do for ya?

818
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
I'm working right now.

819
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,840
Well, you missed
your deadline, chief.

820
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,720
It's time to pay up.

821
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,520
Look, I always honor my debts,
but I'm a bit short right now.

822
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,200
I'll need a couple of weeks.

823
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,000
Download your daddy's financials
onto this.

824
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
You do that and we're square.

825
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,160
My pop with a computer?

826
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,160
You might as well ask for the keys
to his space shuttle.

827
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,800
That's real funny, chief.

828
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,960
What kind of computer
does Rebecca use, hmm?

829
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,600
Look, we wanna know

830
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,840
who your daddy owes money
to and how much.

831
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,400
So tomorrow, I'll be back.

832
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,960
Maybe I'll get myself a beer then,

833
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
but you might not even notice me

834
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,200
'cause I'll be bringing
Clarence with me.

835
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
You.

836
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,040
-Terrence, ma'am.
-You worm, you process server.

837
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,720
You better get outta here,
get off this property.

838
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,280
You're trespassing, cabrón.

839
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Who sent you?

840
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,240
What are you doing here?

841
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,880
What are you doing here?

842
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,280
You got nerve coming down here.

843
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,880
I'm looking for your grandfather.

844
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,520
Well, you found him.

845
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Let him up, Hector.

846
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,360
Got any more bad news
for me, son?

847
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,880
I'm looking for work.

848
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,880
That's getting a little old.

849
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,560
Mr. Landsburg, I do need work,
I'm flat broke.

850
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,440
You seem like a fair man.

851
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,160
Who hired you
to deliver those papers?

852
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,720
You have to be registered
to serve in this state.

853
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,360
-You okay, Lynnie?
-I'm fine, Brady.

854
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
You sure, girl?

855
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,640
Like you care, Mom.

856
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,360
You registered...

857
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
or not?

858
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,640
I am. I got the papers

859
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,160
at the courthouse in the Capitol.

860
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,760
You didn't get 'em
from Tap Peterson?

861
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,120
No, sir.

862
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,680
I don't know the man.
I just, I need a job.

863
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,080
Well, assuming
that you can work cattle

864
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,840
better than you can fight,

865
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,200
you got a job.
You start tomorrow morning, early.

866
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,720
-Hector, get him settled.
-Boss.

867
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,920
-Hector.
-Thank you, sir.

868
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Dad.

869
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,640
No references,
no discussion with your CFO.

870
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,440
-You hire a total stranger.
-That's right.

871
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Why?

872
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,320
He just lied to me again.
I'm sure he knows Tap.

873
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,880
Then get him the hell out of here.

874
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
If we keep him close,

875
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,320
we got a better chance
of finding out what he knows.

876
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
About what?

877
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,520
Tap Peterson is using
the Bureau of Homeland Management

878
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,680
to come after our property.

879
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
-How the hell can he do that?
-Brady...

880
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,240
-Are you gambling again?
-No.

881
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,040
What does that have
to do with anything?

882
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,440
Well, just tryin'
to put the pieces together.

883
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah well,
I ain't one of 'em, Pop.

884
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,600
-Where are you going?
-A little road trip.

885
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,840
Well, I'm coming with you.

886
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,120
You need to straighten things out
with Lynnie.

887
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,040
Maybe it's time

888
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,680
you told her the truth.

889
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,240
Tell me about my father.

890
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,160
Okay, so...

891
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,160
I focused on guys your mom's age
or up to five years older

892
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
'cause I figured

893
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,400
why waste a bunch of time
on a bunch of younger dudes

894
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,000
and if they're too much older,
it's kinda creepy.

895
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,640
Jeremy, what've we got?

896
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,240
I checked...

897
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,040
databases, birth records,
high school yearbooks,

898
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,840
I checked rodeos
and county fairs.

899
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,360
I came up
with nine likely suspects.

900
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Lynnie?

901
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,560
-What is it, Mother?
-Hey, what are you doing?

902
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,960
I'm talking to a hacker I hired
to try to find my father.

903
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,840
Hi. Hi, I'm Jeremy.

904
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Goodbye, Jeremy.

905
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,920
You don't need to do that.

906
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,640
I'll tell you
what you need to know.

907
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,520
I think we scanned and digitized
everything back in '05.

908
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,520
Look, here we go.

909
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,280
Well, that is
my grandfather's signature.

910
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,760
Hang on, zooming in.

911
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,640
Well, this ain't right.

912
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,760
My grandfather
couldn't have signed that.

913
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,480
Look, if we leased
there would've been renewals.

914
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,200
Show me the records
for the renewal payments.

915
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,840
Well, actually, I can't.

916
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,400
Oh, you can't.

917
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,720
It seems that there was...
a clerical error in your favor.

918
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,720
According to my supervisor,
the Bureau was unaware

919
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,440
that you stopped
paying on your lease.

920
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,480
Or that it had even expired
until... until recently

921
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,920
and in most cases,
the Bureau would take legal action

922
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,480
for any back payments owed, but...

923
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,200
you were granted a reprieve,

924
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,080
we're just not renewing
the lease.

925
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
Don't that sound
like a bunch a bull to you?

926
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,160
It does to me.

927
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,960
Let me speak to your supervisor.

928
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Let's do that.

929
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Right now.

930
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,360
I was 17 and he was a year older
than I was.

931
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,520
Your grandpa and grandma

932
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,080
had told me not to mess with him,

933
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,480
stay away from him and...

934
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,480
But I was young
and stupid and rebellious, so...

935
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,800
-Was he cute?
-Oh, yeah, of course he was.

936
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,640
Your grandpa knew
that he was into bad things.

937
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,640
There was a reason that
trouble followed him everywhere, but...

938
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,320
but I took your father's side
and yeah,

939
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,280
he was attractive and strong-willed.

940
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,800
You got that from him.

941
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,080
But...

942
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,080
he didn't have much character.

943
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,600
And at the end of the day,
sweetheart,

944
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,360
character is all that matters, okay?

945
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,400
So, what happened?

946
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,760
Well, your grandpa
caught us together...

947
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,600
threw him out hard and told me

948
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,000
never to see him again
and I didn't.

949
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,880
A month later I found out
I was pregnant.

950
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,840
And I went looking for him,
but he was gone.

951
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,520
Left town, disappeared forever.

952
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,360
Apparently.

953
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,800
Mom, what was his name?

954
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,960
His name is Caleb Peterson.
He's Tap Peterson's boy.

955
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,480
Well, with all the bad blood
between our families,

956
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,960
I really couldn't stand the idea
of you knowing that Tap Peterson

957
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,080
was your granddad.

958
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,400
I need to meet my father.

959
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,360
I need to find him.

960
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,200
We have looked for years,
your grandpa and I.

961
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,800
Don't the Petersons
know where he is?

962
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,200
They have always said no.

963
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,880
So, we just stopped asking.

964
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,280
If he's alive, I will find him.

965
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,000
I love you, baby.

966
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,640
I know you're in a tough spot,
Mr. Landsburg, and I sympathize,

967
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
but I can guarantee you
this is not a forgery.

968
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,320
You've won some awards.

969
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,520
Yeah, if you like,
you can file a complaint.

970
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,920
We can try to dig up
the original in D. C.

971
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,280
But if what you tell me is true,

972
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,440
I suggest you produce
your own copy of the deed,

973
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,440
signed and notarized, of course.

974
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,520
Let's do both.

975
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,160
Just to be sure.

976
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,800
And I'd like a printout
of that deed in your computer.

977
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,400
Agent McCarthy will help you
file the complaint.

978
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,840
You have to fill out a form
for a copy of the deed.

979
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,000
You can't just print one out?

980
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,960
Again, I sympathize,
but rules are rules.

981
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Have a nice day.

982
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,720
Have a nice day.

983
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,800
Yeah, it's Jennings.
Guess who just paid me a visit.

984
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,880
John Landsburg. Call me.

985
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,320
DEED

986
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,200
-Hey, Daddy.
-Hey.

987
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,920
What are you looking for?

988
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,680
The deed.

989
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,720
The original deed to Butcher's Hill.

990
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,160
Butcher's Hill?

991
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,720
What we used to call Parcel 14.

992
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,360
I got deeds and titles
to everything else...

993
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,480
but Butcher's Hill is missing.

994
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,360
Well, you want me
to help you find it?

995
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,080
No, I'm done. It's not here.

996
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,360
Grew legs and walked away.

997
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,720
You mind puttin' this

998
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,680
back together a little bit for me?

999
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,880
Oh, yeah, sure, Daddy.
Yeah, I'll tidy up.

1000
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,840
Thank you, thank you, sweetie.

1001
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,000
Watch your step now.

1002
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,880
I would never turn my back
on my family.

1003
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,680
I mean, in the end...

1004
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,440
family is all you got, you know?

1005
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Whoa.

1006
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,560
I know I've held back
from you, Henry.

1007
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,560
And I thought it was
about my past and...

1008
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,160
who I was, but it's not.

1009
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,560
It's about fear, plain and simple.

1010
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,200
Fear of taking
that next step with you

1011
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,000
and it is... It is still there.

1012
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,280
I'll never hurt you, Rebecca.

1013
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,040
I brought you out here
for a reason, Henry,

1014
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,160
and it wasn't just for the ride.
I'm sorry.

1015
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,720
Well, what am I doing here?

1016
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,560
Tap Peterson is trying
to take our land from us.

1017
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,880
Tap and the Bureau.

1018
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,520
And we're running out of time,
running out of options.

1019
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,040
Can you please stop him?

1020
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,520
Well, that depends,
Miss Landsburg.

1021
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,600
On what, Sheriff Whitlock?

1022
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,520
If Tap Peterson
is doing something illegal

1023
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,800
to take your property
and I can prove it,

1024
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,400
or at least

1025
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,160
find probable cause
then yes, I can stop him,

1026
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,440
I'll be glad to do so.

1027
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,680
But I take the star
and my oath of office seriously.

1028
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,240
Just like your father did.

1029
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,480
Oh, God. So, that's it?

1030
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,920
You're gonna hide behind the law?

1031
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,280
No, I'm gonna uphold it.

1032
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,640
Your father wouldn't have it
any other way.

1033
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,480
Neither would you.

1034
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,800
Don't be so sure, Henry.

1035
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,280
The sheriff,
that's your mother's boyfriend?

1036
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,240
I don't know,
I've never seen her date anyone.

1037
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Where's your father?

1038
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,920
I don't know you well enough
to talk about that sort of thing.

1039
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,120
You seem a little hostile
towards your folks.

1040
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,280
You don't know anything
about my family.

1041
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,040
-I know they care about you.
-You think so?

1042
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,720
Shoot, my daddy never looked me
in the eye his whole life.

1043
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,640
He just sat in his Barcalounger
drinkin' blended Scotch whiskey.

1044
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,600
-And your mom?
-My mom, she worked two jobs,

1045
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,760
hated her life,

1046
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,520
hated everything about it.

1047
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,280
I don't even think they noticed
when I left.

1048
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,840
Grandpa gave it to me.

1049
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,800
It's my grandmother Elizabeth.

1050
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,240
She was a beautiful woman.

1051
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,600
You take after her.

1052
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,800
You know I'm going to LA,
the first chance I get.

1053
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,240
Why don't you go now?
What's stoppin' you?

1054
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,600
Well, it sure isn't you,
if that's what you think.

1055
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,120
John Landsburg
durin' daylight hours?

1056
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,760
Isn't there work
to be done somewhere?

1057
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,960
I just spent three hours
looking through real estate records

1058
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,200
at the courthouse.

1059
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,320
No luck?

1060
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,000
-What's this?
-Got somethin' for you.

1061
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,760
Really?

1062
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,960
Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1949.

1063
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,600
-Wow!
-It's a good one?

1064
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,720
Oh, it's a classic, John.

1065
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,640
What a thoughtful gift.

1066
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,880
It was in the attic.

1067
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,080
I just thought... you might like it.

1068
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,160
That guy at the Bureau...

1069
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,640
playin' games,
givin' me the runaround.

1070
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,480
Oh, boy.

1071
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,520
You're one big knot, John.

1072
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,800
How's that feel?

1073
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,160
Nice.

1074
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,760
If you try to jump
through every hoop

1075
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,120
the Bureau puts in front of you,

1076
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,240
you will be on a walker
before you ever get anywhere.

1077
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,040
I know he's lying.

1078
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,880
I gotta fight him out.

1079
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,880
Can't let him on my land.

1080
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,920
I'll never get 'em off.

1081
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,640
No, you're right, you won't.

1082
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,360
And they'll kill you in court,

1083
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,800
take all your money.
You'll have nothing left.

1084
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,560
I know what my mother would say.

1085
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,520
What?

1086
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,360
Someone needs a good spanking.

1087
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,160
-I like your mother.
-My mother's always right.

1088
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,280
Hello, Terrence.

1089
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,920
Is Mr. Peterson here, ma'am?

1090
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Well...

1091
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,920
He's in his study but...

1092
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,440
Can I speak to him?

1093
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,840
It's really late.

1094
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
It's important.

1095
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,920
Mr. Peterson, sorry it's so late.

1096
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,400
Hey, son,

1097
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,480
how's your grandpa?
You're a real McCall, you know.

1098
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,120
He's as well as can be expected.

1099
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,960
He just finished
his first round of chemo.

1100
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,240
Have a seat.

1101
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,560
Without your help, you know,
he would be...

1102
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,360
dead by now.

1103
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,600
You know, we...

1104
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,640
we do pray for him every night.

1105
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Thank you.

1106
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,000
I'd sure like to know

1107
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,280
what brings you
to my house at this hour.

1108
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,680
Is there something
I can do for you?

1109
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,800
What am I doin'
at John Landsburg's ranch?

1110
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,360
Well, you're workin' there...

1111
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,760
until I tell you not to.

1112
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,280
See, I'd like to...

1113
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,760
know everything he's doing.

1114
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,000
Always wondering that...

1115
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,720
that little college girl
that got out there?

1116
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,480
Lynn.

1117
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,720
What about her?

1118
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,040
Well, I mean she is sure...
a cute little thing, isn't she?

1119
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,520
If you say so.

1120
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,640
If I say so?

1121
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,280
Well, I'd like you to...

1122
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,320
just kinda stay away from her,
all right, son?

1123
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,560
Why is that?

1124
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,120
Well, mainly
'cause I just asked you to.

1125
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,440
Just stay away from her.

1126
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,400
It looks like it's going to snow.

1127
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,440
You oughta be heading home,
don't you think?

1128
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,200
Goodnight, son.

1129
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,520
Goodnight, sir.

1130
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,560
NOTICE OF SEIZURE

1131
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
Daddy.

1132
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,680
Forty-eight hours?

1133
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,280
Yeah, seems like Tap can't wait.

1134
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,960
Well, there's got to be
somethin' we can do.

1135
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,400
Bed and breakfast, sell a parcel.

1136
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,720
Maybe you were both right.

1137
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,600
Yeah, but it's too late
for all that now, isn't it?

1138
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,160
I gotta get my hands
on that deed.

1139
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,920
Somebody took it.

1140
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,720
But who?

1141
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,880
Sweetie.

1142
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,920
Sweetie.

1143
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,440
Rebecca's got her mother's fire,

1144
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,360
but you got her heart.

1145
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,760
You got her heart, honey.

1146
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,520
I miss her.

1147
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,360
That's for you, thank you so much.
Have a good day.

1148
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,160
Hey, where you goin'?

1149
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,280
To see my granddaddy,
Tap Peterson.

1150
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,600
What? Now?

1151
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,280
Lynnie.

1152
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,360
Gosh darn it, girl.

1153
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,960
Are you kidding me?

1154
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,080
Oh, gosh.

1155
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,560
Sorry to interrupt the concert

1156
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,280
but I think it's time you and me
did something crazy.

1157
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,760
I'll get my boots on.

1158
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,080
Excuse me.

1159
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,600
Look...

1160
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,120
outside of the ranch...

1161
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,760
Hi, I'm your granddaughter.

1162
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Excuse me?

1163
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,120
Your son Caleb Peterson
is my father.

1164
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,360
Well, where did you come up
with a story like that?

1165
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,160
I want to find my father.

1166
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,240
That's nice, but...

1167
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,560
see we're gonna have
a little problem here because...

1168
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,480
I really don't want to talk to you.

1169
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,400
You're a Landsburg and...

1170
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,720
I don't like talking to Landsburgs.

1171
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,440
They give me indigestion.

1172
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,040
You're a coward,

1173
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,320
and your son Caleb, my father,

1174
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,880
is just a chip off the old block.

1175
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,640
Look, young lady,

1176
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,840
I don't much care
what you say about me...

1177
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,360
but my son...

1178
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,640
is not a coward.

1179
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,000
I'm sure he has reasons
for running off like he did.

1180
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,720
It's a pretty good thing, too.

1181
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,480
But let me tell you something
there's no way on God's earth...

1182
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,240
that I'll let me son run off with...

1183
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,400
any one of John's daughters.

1184
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,560
None.

1185
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,160
But I happened, what about me?

1186
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,080
Collateral damage.

1187
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,080
Hey, hold it.

1188
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,400
Hold it, hold it.

1189
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
Come here a minute.

1190
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,760
Okay, you can go now.

1191
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,280
Lynn, what's going on, baby?
What happened?

1192
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,120
Talk to me.

1193
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,840
I'm here, honey.

1194
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,080
Okay, come on.

1195
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,560
What are you doing here?
How did you get in my house?

1196
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,640
Easy there, Mr. Jennings.

1197
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,840
You can't do this.
I'm a federal agent.

1198
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,040
You're a pencil-pushin' bureaucrat
and a liar.

1199
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,120
You're gonna lose a lot more
than just your property, Landsburg.

1200
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,560
Hey, wait, wait, wait. John, wait.

1201
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,960
Listen...

1202
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,120
do not get him riled up.

1203
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,760
The last time you met,

1204
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,280
you got him really riled up.

1205
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,120
Don't even say anything.

1206
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,320
Nod your head.

1207
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,080
Okay, good.

1208
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,800
You know, John, come on.
Just don't shoot him.

1209
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,160
He didn't mean any harm.

1210
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,880
He's just following orders.

1211
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
That's right.

1212
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,000
-Whose orders?
-Charlie Lincoln in Washington.

1213
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,560
Never heard of him.

1214
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,320
He works for Senator Archer.

1215
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,000
Come here.

1216
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
Sit down.

1217
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
Keep talking.

1218
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,120
Charlie said to get that parcel.

1219
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,240
So, I took the signature
from the original deed

1220
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,000
and I pasted it into the fake
and uploaded it into the system.

1221
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,800
All I had to do
was backdate the file

1222
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,600
to match the time frame
and the personnel

1223
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,800
to when we originally
digitized the records.

1224
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,120
Where's the deed?

1225
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,240
Shredded.

1226
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,640
How much did you get
for ruining a man's life?

1227
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,720
Promotion to GS-15.

1228
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,560
How's Tap Peterson involved?

1229
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,800
Come on, you can say it, just,
just come on.

1230
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,840
Tap owned the pillar cliffs
along the river.

1231
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,440
Senator Archer wanted that land
for the Bureau to designate it

1232
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,200
like a monument to himself.

1233
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,920
The only way Tap would
get rid of that property

1234
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,760
was to trade it for yours.

1235
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,720
Some lady brokered the deal.

1236
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,600
Schaefer or Shaffer.

1237
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,720
Laura Lee.

1238
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,640
Okay, that's it.
We're good, John.

1239
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,680
We'll see ourselves out.

1240
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,760
And we thank you
for your cooperation, Mr. Jennings.

1241
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,320
And then you said to him,
"You can say it, come on."

1242
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,520
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Come on.

1243
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,120
Look, we got company here.

1244
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,600
Henry.

1245
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,760
I heard an ugly rumor out
of the Capitol.

1246
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,400
Some supervisor at the Bureau

1247
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,280
got himself threatened at gunpoint.

1248
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,000
No kidding.

1249
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,720
Know anything about that?

1250
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
Not a thing, Sheriff. You?

1251
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,760
Nope.

1252
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,720
I guess it must just be
a rumor then.

1253
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,520
I heard something, too.

1254
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,000
Not just a rumor.

1255
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,880
A supervisor admitted
that the deed they have on file

1256
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,960
is a forgery.

1257
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,480
Do you have any proof of that
other than your word?

1258
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,600
No.

1259
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,360
But you do have my word.

1260
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,640
John that's not evidence,
that's respect.

1261
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,120
I guess respect's not worth
what it used to be.

1262
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,320
No, sir, it is not.

1263
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,440
But it's important to me
though that you know how I feel.

1264
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,000
I appreciate that.

1265
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,600
You got to know,

1266
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,080
I need to be there tomorrow,

1267
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,800
when the Bureau comes.

1268
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,680
Sure.

1269
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,440
All right.

1270
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Hey, John.

1271
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,840
This is a surprise.

1272
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,920
No, it isn't.

1273
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,400
No, it isn't.

1274
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,640
Do you want a drink?

1275
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,240
No.

1276
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,760
Fixin' it up to sell, huh?

1277
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
No, I'm not gonna sell
this place.

1278
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,080
It's too many memories here.

1279
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,520
Your daddy ran me off
a couple of times.

1280
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,480
Well, serves you right

1281
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,000
for sneaking into
an innocent girl's bedroom.

1282
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,760
I guess you were never innocent.

1283
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,640
No.

1284
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,640
Why'd you do it, Laura?

1285
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,000
Why help Tap destroy my family?

1286
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,840
For the commission, John.

1287
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,160
Girl's gotta eat.

1288
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,920
You know...

1289
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,520
there's always a place
for you here.

1290
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,120
If you need it, John.

1291
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,000
Senator Archer...

1292
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,160
must be really desperate
for a legacy to risk all this.

1293
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,600
Well, all politicians want stuff
named after them.

1294
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,120
They have bigger egos
than movie stars.

1295
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,760
Has to be something
more than that.

1296
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah, of course, it's money.

1297
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,600
Tap and the honorable Senator,

1298
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,320
they own an energy company.

1299
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,920
So, they're gonna build
a solar power plant on your dirt

1300
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,280
with a nice federal subsidy.

1301
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,000
They don't need my well for that.

1302
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,960
No, your water's gonna be
diverted

1303
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,800
to restore a salmon run.

1304
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,320
Thank you, Laura.

1305
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,400
I appreciate your candor.

1306
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,600
You're welcome.

1307
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,800
I did mean what I said

1308
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,520
about there's a place
for you here.

1309
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,280
Look...

1310
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,200
guilty people should make amends.

1311
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,760
Or they'll pay for it
somewhere down the line.

1312
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,680
Yeah, if you believe
that sort of thing.

1313
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,120
Yeah, if you believe
that sort of thing.

1314
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,280
Tap has been spoilin'
for this fight

1315
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,720
his whole life, you know.

1316
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,840
Be careful.

1317
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,840
You armed?

1318
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,840
No.

1319
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,040
Well, won't you come on in.

1320
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,120
I think Lynnie deserves
to know who her daddy is.

1321
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,960
We've kept it from her,
you know, for good, for bad.

1322
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,320
It just doesn't matter anymore,

1323
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,080
does it?

1324
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,400
I loved your son.

1325
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,240
I loved him.

1326
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,520
And he said he loved me.

1327
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,080
I never ran him off, ma'am.

1328
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,160
He was a liar then.

1329
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,560
Caleb wasn't a liar.

1330
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,920
I never heard from him again.

1331
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,560
I never heard another word.

1332
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,080
Not another single word
from him ever.

1333
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,680
What kind of person does that?

1334
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,200
He's a coward and a liar.

1335
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,520
He lied to me.

1336
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,720
Your dad called and said

1337
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,600
he caught you guys
together again and...

1338
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,040
then knocked Caleb on his butt.

1339
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,440
He told me what he did.

1340
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,800
Things got a little heated,

1341
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,640
got a little out of hand.

1342
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,640
I told him to get his butt
over here,

1343
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,200
he said he was going
to come over

1344
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,520
and do the same to me.

1345
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,720
Momma never let him out the door.

1346
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,440
So, I guess she saved you all...

1347
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,040
both some unwanted trouble.

1348
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,320
John, maybe but not me.

1349
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,480
How is that?

1350
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,640
John Landsburg...

1351
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,240
trespassing my property was...

1352
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,240
was not a threat.

1353
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,640
It was an opportunity
to take care of things.

1354
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,920
So, I ran in the house
and got my shotgun and...

1355
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,640
just waited on him
in the dark there.

1356
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,280
Well, see, the dark has a lot
to do with this story.

1357
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,440
So, pretty soon
I see your daddy come...

1358
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,560
honkin' up that driveway and...

1359
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,120
I yelled, "Hey, John."

1360
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,680
He didn't say nothin'.

1361
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,120
Don't turn his head, nothin'.

1362
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,800
So, I shot.

1363
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
It wasn't John.

1364
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,160
It was Caleb, my...

1365
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,680
I shot my son...

1366
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,480
Caleb.

1367
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,400
But I guess it says something.

1368
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,360
It was meant to be.

1369
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,960
'Cause you were a Landsburg...

1370
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,120
and I was a Peterson.

1371
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,480
I'm very sorry, but...

1372
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,320
you tell your daddy...

1373
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,320
Tell him I'll come by tomorrow
and get that land.

1374
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,440
-Excuse me.
-Hey, cover for me?

1375
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,080
There's a meeting down at the
courthouse.

1376
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,160
I got to be there.

1377
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,360
Okay.

1378
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,280
Come here.

1379
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,800
Howdy, Brady.

1380
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,880
You got them financials for me?

1381
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,400
You can have it back,

1382
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,040
but there ain't nothin' on it.

1383
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,520
I don't care who you work for.
I won't do it.

1384
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,840
Leave my family alone.

1385
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,960
Hold this.

1386
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,960
Beat him, don't kill him.

1387
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,720
I'm not much for asking for things,

1388
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,920
as you know.

1389
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,840
But the Bureau is coming

1390
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,000
to take a piece
of my ranch tomorrow.

1391
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,080
To do it, corrupt officials

1392
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,840
altered documents
my grandfather signed

1393
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,200
a hundred years ago.

1394
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,880
I lived here all my life.

1395
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,440
Like my daddy,
my grandfather most of his.

1396
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,520
My family owns every inch

1397
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,400
of that land they're trying to steal.

1398
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,800
They're trying to take the water.

1399
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,440
You all know what that means.

1400
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,160
They take our water,
we're bankrupt.

1401
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,080
That's trouble for all of us.

1402
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,400
So, I'm asking you...

1403
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,120
I'm asking you to stand with us.

1404
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,320
To stop the Bureau
from tearing down our fence,

1405
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,120
from seizing our well.

1406
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,720
Stop them from
robbing our family of its legacy.

1407
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,920
But this is a community thing.
This affects us all.

1408
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,200
Well, you're asking people
to risk their lives, John.

1409
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,240
Look, if we allow corrupt men

1410
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,720
to thumb their noses at the laws
that we live by,

1411
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,040
who will they come after next?

1412
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,920
You, Dr. Taylor? You, Elaine?

1413
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,000
I buried my brother...

1414
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,160
my mother...

1415
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,680
my wife...

1416
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,080
on that land they're trying
to steal.

1417
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,240
John...

1418
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,480
I got my own family
that I gotta worry about.

1419
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,040
Come on, babe.

1420
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,280
I can't risk their future
by standing out there with you.

1421
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,520
None of us can.

1422
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,280
I'm sorry, John.

1423
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,760
Well, I appreciate
everyone coming.

1424
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,040
It's good of you to be here
to hear me out.

1425
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,240
This is all my fault.

1426
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,080
'Cause I took the deed.

1427
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,520
I took the deed and I gave it
to Laura Lee Schaefer.

1428
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,160
Why?

1429
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,280
Laura Lee came to me.

1430
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,480
She said she heard
we were having money problems

1431
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,880
and she had a solution.

1432
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,680
You sell the parcel,
save the ranch.

1433
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,840
Save my home.

1434
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,480
She told me she needed to see
all the deeds for the buyer.

1435
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,720
And you believed her?

1436
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,400
I didn't know
she was working for Tap.

1437
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,480
And I didn't know she took one,

1438
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,080
until you told me
the deed was missing.

1439
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,040
I'm so sorry, Daddy.
I'm so sorry.

1440
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,680
What's goin' on?

1441
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,240
I was just tellin' your sister

1442
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,840
that she can have no part
in this today.

1443
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,400
She's got the boys and Jerry
to think about.

1444
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,280
What are you gonna do?

1445
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,040
I'm going with him.

1446
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,960
No one's goin' up there but me.

1447
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,560
There's nothing in this world
you could do to stop me.

1448
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,440
Us, Daddy, us.

1449
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,720
I don't want you girls goin'
and that's it.

1450
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,200
But this is our ranch too, Dad,
and we'll decide what we do.

1451
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,640
Like old times?

1452
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,080
-Flashin' on desert storm.
-Right.

1453
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,560
Just don't get any sand in it.

1454
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,360
Okay, boss.

1455
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,520
Well, look at you.

1456
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,480
This ranch is who we are.

1457
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,800
I'll be damned if I ain't
gonna be a part of that.

1458
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,200
Son, there might not be
much ranch...

1459
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,440
come day's end.

1460
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,760
Well, not without a fight.

1461
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,360
Never was there a family
with less sense.

1462
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,360
Okay, go get yourself cleaned up.

1463
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,520
All right.

1464
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,080
We'll make a camp right here.

1465
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,480
-All right.
-We'll camp.

1466
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,720
We can tie those horses
to the well head.

1467
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,800
Got ya.

1468
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,240
All right.

1469
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,560
Want me to build a fire, boss?

1470
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,680
Better hold off on that.

1471
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,320
Stay right there.

1472
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,200
This is private property.

1473
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,320
In 25 minutes,

1474
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,040
this land and that well

1475
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,800
will belong
to the federal government.

1476
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,000
We can wait.

1477
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,720
Well, maybe I'll stick
around then, too.

1478
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,080
-Where's the sheriff?
-I haven't seen him.

1479
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,640
Morning, Peterson.

1480
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,320
Okay, let's set up over here,
you guys.

1481
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,480
What are you doin' here?

1482
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,840
Figured you wouldn't mind

1483
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,920
a few of those Bureau guns
aimed at me.

1484
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,480
You don't fire that thing
unless I tell you.

1485
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,680
-Copy that.
-Grandpa.

1486
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,440
I actually don't own a firearm.

1487
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,280
I'm a firm believer in gun control.

1488
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,440
Well, then you stay
behind me, girl.

1489
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,640
Here, you take this, Lynnie.

1490
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,800
-Yeah.
-Put it over there.

1491
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,880
Okay.

1492
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,360
Everyone take cover.

1493
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,600
-Brady, over here.
-All right, Pop.

1494
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,640
Hector, with the girls
and stay there.

1495
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,720
Got it.

1496
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,800
What you're doing is wrong.

1497
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,640
The deed you've been shown is a lie.

1498
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,400
It's a forgery.

1499
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,040
Tap Peterson knows it's a forgery.
He arranged it.

1500
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,880
It's a bunch of garbage.

1501
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,360
Now, I don't know
how many of you

1502
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,920
have shot anyone.
It's not a great feeling.

1503
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,360
But I can't let you on my land
and I will do what I have to,

1504
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,560
to keep you out.

1505
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,440
You don't know who I am,
most of you.

1506
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,400
But the people around here
will generally tell you

1507
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,040
that I mean what I say.

1508
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,480
And that's just who I am.

1509
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,520
Who are you?

1510
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,120
What kind of family
do you come from?

1511
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,840
We live and die for the land
that our fathers gave us,

1512
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,920
that's who we are.

1513
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,560
Ronnie Tiwwit.

1514
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,360
Are you going to shoot us?

1515
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Are you?

1516
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,880
Really?

1517
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,520
Put down your weapons!

1518
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,880
Never.

1519
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,160
How's that?

1520
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,040
Daddy.

1521
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,440
-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

1522
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:03,840
Hey.

1523
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,080
Hey, baby.

1524
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,600
They all came because they
remembered

1525
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,040
everything you've done for them.

1526
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,720
-All right, you get safe now.
-All right.

1527
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,000
Okay, Hector, take Brady.

1528
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,320
Get right over there,
right behind him.

1529
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,840
You better move
some of them trucks.

1530
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,640
Hey, man. We're ready.

1531
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,600
Oh, you are ready, man.
It's so good to see you, Martin.

1532
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,440
Thanks for coming, guys.

1533
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,840
Get over there behind that truck.

1534
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,240
Bring those cars out up
in this direction.

1535
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,760
The National Guard
will be dispatched shortly.

1536
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,480
If you do not lay down
your weapons

1537
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,680
and disperse,

1538
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,040
you will be arrested.

1539
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,240
Take Mr. Landsburg into custody.

1540
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,040
I gave you fair warning.

1541
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,000
Don't you dare move.

1542
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,200
Get in position, you guys.

1543
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,800
Daddy, look.

1544
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,360
Hey, you see that?

1545
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,680
THIS LAND IS OUR LAND

1546
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,800
Stand down now.

1547
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,760
Come on, boys,
put your weapons down.

1548
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,200
-Guys.
-That's the sheriff.

1549
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,600
Guys, stand down.

1550
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,240
Come on, out of the way.

1551
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,800
I'm from the Capitol, step aside.

1552
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,640
John Landsburg.

1553
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,840
John.

1554
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,800
Judge Gibson from the Capitol
has granted you a stay.

1555
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,280
The Bureau can't take any action
against the Landsburg Ranch,

1556
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,320
pending further investigation.

1557
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,600
Put those guns down now.

1558
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,160
We are a part
of the same community.

1559
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,440
Nice work, everyone.

1560
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,120
-Nice work.
-Come on, let's all go home.

1561
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,960
Back out. Back in the cars.
Back down.

1562
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,440
How'd you do that?

1563
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,400
I can be pretty persuasive

1564
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,880
on the right occasion.

1565
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,480
Yes, you can.

1566
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,080
Thanks for...
Thanks everybody for coming.

1567
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,120
That's right. You're all invited.

1568
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,360
You, too.
I'm glad you came, man.

1569
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,680
I'm so glad you came.

1570
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,960
Your great grandma and grandpa,

1571
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,360
Nellie and Jeremiah,

1572
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,760
faced many challenges
to pass this ranch down to us.

1573
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,840
But they were strong,
they worked hard

1574
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,760
and they never gave up.

1575
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,800
And we're not about to either.

1576
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,840
JL RANCH
