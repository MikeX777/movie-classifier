1
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,680
What's the time?

2
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,960
02:23 and 10 seconds. Beep!

3
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,800
Christ, you'll have to leave. Bye.

4
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,439
John, dear. Come!

5
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,800
-Come and lie with me.
-No, don't pull me. I can't.

6
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,480
Please, just leave.

7
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,760
What the hell's gotten into you?
I'm sleeping here!

8
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
No, you're not. Get lost, go!

9
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,320
You're hurting me!

10
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't feel well.

11
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,640
-Please.
-Okay, I'm going!

12
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,359
-Good.
-Shit!

13
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,520
I live out in Angered.

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,360
It's damned cold!

15
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,880
Then you must take a taxi. Here.

16
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,640
200 kronor should be enough.

17
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,080
If I'd known what a fucking...

18
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,560
You regret this, little man?

19
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:30,600
Take another hundred.
Reception will order a taxi for you.

20
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,400
You're a...

21
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:57,240
Hello, it's me.

22
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,440
Yes,
I know it's almost 02:30, but I must...

23
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,640
I need the telephone number
of George Mezinski in Los Angeles.

24
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,520
It on the notepad by the telephone.

25
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,959
Yes, I have to call tonight.

26
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm sorry, Anna. No, I'm not drunk...

27
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,800
Is someone there with you?

28
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,680
The radio's on?

29
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
I see, Tina is still up.

30
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,400
Yes, thanks. Los Angeles, yeah...

31
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,359
Yes, one, two. Thanks.

32
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,360
When I called yesterday evening,
no one answered.

33
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,759
No, damn...

34
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,679
Shit!

35
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,640
Is anybody home?

36
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,559
Don't shout.
John Jr's asleep with a fever.

37
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,760
-Hi.
-Hi.

38
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,879
-Hope it's nothing serious, then.
-No, it's just a cold.

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
Yeah...

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,080
-How was Gothenburg?
-Zandor got drunk as usual.

41
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:27,320
But we sold the new novel well anyway.

42
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,200
The booksellers think he's so colorful.

43
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:34,239
-Have you started smoking?
-No. Why?

44
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,920
Why? There's a butt here, a slim More.
The same that Carl smokes.

45
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,360
Really? I don't know.

46
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,559
-It must be Tina.
-So, she's started smoking again?

47
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,919
Sorry, I have to go to the store.
I haven't bought dinner.

48
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,280
-I called earlier, but no one answered.
-No, I was at the pharmacy.

49
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:55,560
-You weren't going to work at all.
-Inger got sick.

50
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,240
But I answered when you called
at 02:30 the other night.

51
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,560
Yeah, but I had to call George.
Los Angeles, six hours.

52
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,440
It's very strange you don't
have his number in your phone book.

53
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,079
-You wrote it when he was here last fall.
-I forgot it at the office.

54
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,080
At Hasse's place, they have a video,
and we saw a horrible film

55
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,799
about a guy who shot another guy
in the foot so it exploded.

56
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,120
There was another guy
who threw a fox trap over his head...

57
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,440
A gun! Is it real?

58
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,119
It's a water pistol.
But you can't shoot it inside.

59
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,479
But at the country house this summer,
we can shoot.

60
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,240
-Did you miss your dad?
-Not much.

61
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,280
I've been at Hasse's for two days.
I got the cold from him.

62
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:55,080
Was Tina at Sophie's Saturday and Sunday?

63
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,039
No, not indoors I said!
What a dumb gift that was.

64
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,279
-So Mom's been alone for a few days?
-No.

65
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,160
A stranger was here Saturday
and Fia and Jens were here after.

66
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,679
-You have a hickey on your neck, Dad.
-Hi. What's that?

67
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,440
-What the hell are you saying?
-Just kidding.

68
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,759
Do you have a bad conscience?

69
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
Such silliness!

70
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Stop it, you horrible brat! Cut it out!

71
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,879
Calm down.
Give him the gun. Not like that!

72
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,440
You can't shoot indoors.
Remember, he's sick.

73
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:40,880
-What about me? Don't I get anything?
-Yes, you get Zandor's new novel.

74
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,039
-I get it for free anyway.
-Mom said you'd started smoking again.

75
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
What's she talking about?

76
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm actually 18
and I do what I like!

77
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,319
You're nuts, John.
There's no way Anna's having an affair.

78
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,639
But she was quite hot for you in Italy,
for instance.

79
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
That was 14 years ago!

80
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,120
And it was just a bit of fun.
Pull yourself together, John.

81
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,560
That damn Italian party
is nothing to get hung up on.

82
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,560
No. Alright, then.

83
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,999
You're feeling guilty
about that broad in Gothenburg.

84
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,119
It's not so odd.

85
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Napoleon said that infidelity occurs
when there's a sofa nearby.

86
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,680
I was at Eberman's home in Frankfurt.

87
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
His wife's a bit... You know.

88
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,960
He went out to buy cigarettes.

89
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
-She pulled me into the bedroom and...
-Clara Fallgren is here.

90
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,760
And Stig Svensson.

91
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,159
I came along to make sure
everything goes by the book.

92
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,480
-We want a big goddamn advance.
-Yeah, okay.

93
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,840
-Have you read...?
-Welcome, Clara.

94
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,560
Great you could come.

95
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,440
You know how much I like your poems.

96
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,120
-Please, take a seat.
-Thanks.

97
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,879
-It's the best writing in years.
-This century.

98
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,680
-Hello.
-Yes, this is John. Clara.

99
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,479
I thought you were a lot... older.

100
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,120
I read the manuscript yesterday.
It moved me.

101
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,599
It's as if you have
so much experience of life.

102
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,760
-Anyone have a beer?
-Sorry.

103
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,719
No, but we have Cognac. Of course
we're going to celebrate our new poet.

104
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,719
With a glass of Renault Carte Noire.
That okay?

105
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,560
That's good. Make mine a large one.

106
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,240
“And the key turns in my heart
as I lock my summer house.”

107
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,920
You've read it, I hear.
Only, it's not her summer house.

108
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,879
No, it was Stig's father's.

109
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
But he sold it.

110
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
Hi.

111
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,839
-Sorry we're late.
-Where's Stig?

112
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,039
-He's in a bad mood.
-No, he couldn't come. He's working.

113
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,440
-He has to write an article.
-Bullshit. He's just sulking.

114
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,079
Hello.

115
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm Anna. John's other half.

116
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,079
What a wonderful day. Is it far?

117
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,400
No, it's on that little island.
It's called Askholmen.

118
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,359
Jesus, it's cold!

119
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,239
Go, Dad, go!

120
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,639
Hi! Anyone want a ride?

121
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,199
Me!

122
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,440
-Wait for me!
-How exciting! Where do I sit?

123
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,960
Sit up front and hold the mast.

124
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,719
-We'll take it easy.
-Be really careful, Clara!

125
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,920
-John's lethal.
-Geronimo!

126
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,800
We're coming about. Hold on!

127
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,200
Goddamn madman!

128
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
Watch out!

129
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,680
-What the hell are you doing?
-Stig!

130
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,320
Hi. I changed my mind.

131
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,640
You're fucking nuts!

132
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,759
Come on!

133
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,040
Food's ready.

134
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,279
Well...

135
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,880
You're welcome.

136
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,039
-You could have killed us.
-Wishful thinking.

137
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,840
Give Mom a kiss!

138
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,560
Let's have a sauna!
I put on the sauna out there.

139
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,440
Yes, let's get those pants off!

140
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,760
Oh, yeah. You just want
to see Tina naked. Small girls...

141
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,920
-That's all that turns him on.
-Let's strip off!

142
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,839
-Yeah, let's strip.
-Is this a damn orgy, or what?

143
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,160
Sure, hygiene's important, Stig!

144
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,280
Jerk! Forget it... Come on, let's go home.

145
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,999
I don't want to. Let me go!

146
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,360
Come on, you little hussy.

147
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,560
Let's calm down.
We'll forget about the sauna.

148
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,719
Let's have herring
and a drink in the kitchen.

149
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,079
-Publisher asshole, who you think you are?
-Damn nutso!

150
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,360
Go to hell! You know, I paid for all this.

151
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,480
Not only me, but other writers.
They've written all this with their blood.

152
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,999
-So you could buy all this.
-You're a real black pudding!

153
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,360
What the fuck are you doing?

154
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:50,079
Check out the cocktail sausage!
What's that for? Come on.

155
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm staying.

156
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,400
Come on.

157
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Come on! Do I have to carry you?

158
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,520
If you move, I'll shoot.

159
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,199
Here's some ink, so you can write
a few more summer houses for us!

160
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
Jesus, you're assholes.

161
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,239
Aren't you coming, Clara?

162
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,319
-Where's my jacket?
-Stay!

163
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,959
-If you stay you'll go back to Beckis!
-Stay, Stig!

164
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,240
-You can't drive. You've been drinking!
-It's fine.

165
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,799
There's no traffic on the ice in winter.

166
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,680
-Bye, you murderer!
-You're all nuts.

167
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,680
-What are you doing here?
-Why can't I have my own bed?

168
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,640
You know Carl wouldn't leave Clara alone
if they slept in the big room.

169
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,760
I want you now.

170
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,719
-Why do you always...?
-Always?

171
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,119
It's never!

172
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,320
-You detest me.
-You can love in other ways.

173
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,320
Clara can sleep in the big room...

174
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:26,040
Okay, do it against the sink. But be
quick, I have to give Fia and Jens towels.

175
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,359
"In this fucking truth...

176
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,559
And when he'd thanked the Devil for
the meal, there was no light in his eyes.

177
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,040
He stamped on the chest of his companion

178
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,079
and tied a knot in the swan's neck."

179
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,520
We thank Clara Fallgren for her reading.

180
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:16,400
Now I'd like to present Carl-Magnus von
Seth who'll read some of his latest poems.

181
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,559
I've brought with me some local poetry
from the village where I live.

182
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
I'll read a few poems.

183
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:33,639
"The outer helps up the inner
a little bit.

184
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,840
If you enter our bedroom
you'll see that our bodies

185
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,960
float above the treetops.

186
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,320
It's a chestnut and two cherry trees."

187
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,000
Thanks for the dinner.

188
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,719
For everything.

189
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,120
You've been so very kind.

190
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,000
Considerate.

191
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,320
To read for all these people...

192
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,600
-Could you see my hands shaking?
-No.

193
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,360
You were good.

194
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,199
Listen...

195
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
How are things with Stig?

196
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,720
-And you?
-Not good.

197
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,639
He's so...

198
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, he's unhappy.

199
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,919
-Does he hit you?
-No, but...

200
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,360
He's in a dead-end.

201
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:01,440
Yeah. Life isn't tripping
the light elastic as Kate Rolfsen said.

202
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,759
No.

203
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,120
-You feel like a whisky?
-No, thanks.

204
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,280
I have to look a bit fresh tomorrow.

205
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:21,200
In the bookstore when I'm signing books.
If anyone comes.

206
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,040
And I'm going to see my dad.

207
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,320
I'd love to stay, but I have
to catch a plane in the morning.

208
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,840
There's been some mix-up with Zandor.

209
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,400
And the Book of the Month.

210
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
Good night.

211
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,200
Good night.

212
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,559
God, you scared me!
You weren't due back until tonight.

213
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,080
You drinking stereo coffee?
There are two cups.

214
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,600
-No, Carl was here. Didn't you meet him?
-Yes.

215
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,919
-Does he live here now?
-Stop it!

216
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,160
He came half an hour ago to leave some
papers. You know he's off to London.

217
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,880
You moved the painting
from the fireplace to the sofa?

218
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:27,519
-Yes, I think the light's better there.
-Yeah, it looks good there.

219
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,079
We must get rid of that English hunting
thing. Where the hell will we hang it?

220
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,120
In the toilet. I'm so tired of it.

221
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,600
So Carl was so charmed by you
he forgot to leave the papers?

222
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:45,000
No. Here you are.

223
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,000
-Suffocating.
-What?

224
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,200
What?

225
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,760
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

226
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,440
I just think it's suffocatingly hot here.

227
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,999
Well, then turn down the heat.

228
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,999
-How was Ystad?
-It was as usual.

229
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,840
Is there any coffee left over for me?

230
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,559
The train stops at the station.
Three men get off.

231
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,879
It's me, the deaf and the blind. He sees,
the other one hears - I stand beside them.

232
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,800
-Do you want...?
-No thanks.

233
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,679
I just want quiet!

234
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,399
Must you eat crispbread?

235
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,239
You're being silly. I'm going out
as soon as I've had my coffee.

236
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,000
Leave your damn silence here.

237
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,160
How can I work when you walk around
in silence all the time?

238
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,799
I do everything I can not to disturb you.
I'm out all day.

239
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,799
I can't turn into a gas.

240
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:41,880
You're like a damn gas
because you suffocate me.

241
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,679
How can I work when you tell me

242
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,159
"Must you? Must you write
when you can help with the dishes?

243
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,960
"Must you write when we can go
to the movies, talk or watch Dallas?

244
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,239
"Must you write
when the sun shines, when it rains?"

245
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,200
And me?
I have to write when you sleep, at night.

246
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,480
Your fucking poems...

247
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,080
You'd go crazy if I wrote
in the bedroom while you worked here.

248
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:14,000
-Go and sleep. Go to bed.
-No, I'm going out.

249
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,960
-Go to bed!
-To sea, to sea...

250
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,120
I hate you! You get it?

251
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,000
Hello. Hello...

252
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,480
Ladies and gentlemen.

253
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,200
A warm welcome to

254
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,240
Olovsson and Hjortfelt's 10th anniversary!

255
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,680
We've put on
a smorgasbord in the basement.

256
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:16,119
Eat, drink and be merry,

257
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,400
for tomorrow is another gray day.

258
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,359
Cheers!

259
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,560
I got a refusal on deductions for my
workspace from that damn tax inspector.

260
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:34,800
-I've had it four years, he didn't care!
-That's how they are.

261
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
I've got an Alfa Romeo.
It's a damned good car.

262
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,200
-I always had a thing for Citroens.
-Also very good.

263
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,039
I wonder where that blonde went?

264
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,600
Fucking leeches!

265
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,120
You know, I asked him
if I could have a small goddamn advance.

266
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,800
The sonofabitch just looked at me,

267
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:01,080
as though he thought I was nuts.

268
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,000
Which, by the way, is a misunderstanding.

269
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,400
I usually take payment in whisky.

270
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,120
It's much better for both parties.
Especially at readings.

271
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,720
You know that girl from the radio?
That worked out just fine.

272
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,119
-The dark-haired continuity girl?
-No, the blonde.

273
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,760
-But she lived out in Tensta.
-Oh, God.

274
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,240
-You're really putting it away.
-You must seize the day on company dime.

275
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:34,760
Of course,
it's healthiest and best to eat at home.

276
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:38,679
Home-made. Mom's meatballs...

277
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,520
What if you don't get much at home?

278
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,760
I often go to bed very hungry.

279
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,520
Then you have the right
to eat somewhere else.

280
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,160
Maybe you could offer me
something tasty sometime?

281
00:27:55,239 --> 00:28:01,599
Oh yes. At home I try and come
up with all kinds of variations, but...

282
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,319
Jens doesn't eat that much.

283
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,640
John? Jan Myrdal is looking for you.

284
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:14,760
-You can't only chat with your secretary.
-We were talking about Mom's meatballs.

285
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,439
Jan Myrdal? Right.

286
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,720
My goodness! The accountant
peeping at the toilets again?

287
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,440
Helena Lagerborg is in there with Acke
Zandor! And Lars-Åke Jansson...

288
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,759
They're doing a bit of...

289
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,200
What are you up to?

290
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,680
Hey! Leif or whatever
your name is.

291
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,199
-You have any more wine?
-You've had enough.

292
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,480
You've had enough...
You don't fucking decide, you gay asshole!

293
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,040
Stop it, Stig. Let's join the others.

294
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,480
Who the fuck does he think he is?

295
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:04,880
Stig!

296
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,799
Let go of me!

297
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,480
I'm leaving. I'll go with Carl.

298
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,480
-Are we going or what?
-I must stay to make sure people get home.

299
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,200
-He's right!
-You're stuck in the whipping cream!

300
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,320
-Let's go!
-Goodbye.

301
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,519
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

302
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,680
-See you at the barricades tomorrow.
-Turn the lights out. Okay?

303
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,280
-Bye. Come on Jens, let's go.
-No!

304
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,559
There's loads of wine left.
I'm going to take a couple of bottles.

305
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm leaving now anyway.
The taxi has been waiting for ages.

306
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,640
Stig? Stig! Come on, get up!

307
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,200
You won't be able to wake him now.

308
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,040
No? Well, he'll have
to lie there until tomorrow.

309
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,600
Can he?

310
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,039
Thanks.

311
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,959
Oh, water is so good!

312
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,120
Yeah, water is good when you're...

313
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,400
Please Clara, don't cry.

314
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
Clara.

315
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,279
Don't cry. Clara, don't cry. Clara?

316
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,600
Hi! I thought you could come home
with me. We finished early today.

317
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,240
You didn't yesterday.
You didn't come home.

318
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:23,199
No, it got late yesterday.
It was hard to find a taxi.

319
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,559
-I slept on the sofa in my room.
-Really?

320
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,480
Stig passed out on the floor in the
basement. He threw up on the carpet!

321
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,760
Pig...

322
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,840
I have some errands in town.
Go home and sleep.

323
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,359
You can pick up John Jr from school
on the way. He'll be happy.

324
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,399
-Sure. Bye.
-Bye.

325
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:55,520
Dad's very special. He loves boats and has
an echo sounder to measure depth with.

326
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,679
When he sails he looks at it and says,
"Wow, it's deep here!"

327
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,399
Then he sails a bit more and says,
"Wow, it's not that deep here!”

328
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,680
I have to find somewhere to live.

329
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,400
I can always go home to Dad.
I can write there.

330
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:34,680
In Skåne? No, then we won't get to meet!

331
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:41,720
-Well, I may have an idea.
-Really? What?

332
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:45,200
It's not much to look at, but...

333
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:48,800
-Do you know someone with an apartment?
-Yes. I have an apartment.

334
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,280
-Where?
-I inherited some buildings in Södermalm.

335
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,680
There's a one room apartment in one
of them. It's not modern or anything.

336
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,399
It doesn't matter.
So, you're a real capitalist?

337
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,240
That's great!

338
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:08,919
There's no elevator,
but there's a corner store.

339
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,520
-I love Södermalm.
-A used car salesman lived there before.

340
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,640
The stairs are tough...

341
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,760
Everyone I know who lives in buildings
without elevators lives on the top floor!

342
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,359
There's a law for that.

343
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,880
Step in, to paradise.

344
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,759
Not much of a view. But the room is big.

345
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,759
Big...

346
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:56,120
There's a bathtub!

347
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,360
-A stove.
-Yes, you can light a fire in it.

348
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,320
-We'll buy new furniture on Monday.
-No!

349
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,560
What for? It's fine the way it is.

350
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,680
I think that you're good.

351
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:38,400
I think that you're very good.

352
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,599
But I can't, Stig.

353
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:47,799
No, I'm not. But I can't anymore.

354
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:51,200
Listen to me...

355
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:55,959
Listen, I just called
to say my stuff, the old guitar,

356
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,279
the dictionary
or whatever else, you can keep them.

357
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,200
Or throw them away, do whatever you like.

358
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,439
Yeah...

359
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,839
You could tell me where you are.

360
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,560
No. Yeah...

361
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,480
Be seeing you, Clara. Take it easy.

362
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,480
Yeah, yeah...
I'm working like hell, you know.

363
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:29,919
The Greenery is almost finished.

364
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,439
I have to fry a pork chop,
so I can't talk.

365
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,760
Bye, take it easy. Bye.

366
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,640
Totally professional!

367
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,640
Now you can be here without throwing up.

368
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,640
It's really nice in here now.

369
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,280
-Let's forget this now and go for a swim.
-Yeah.

370
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,320
What's this? No...!

371
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,560
Look at this!
My panties have been cut to bits.

372
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:48,320
All of them.

373
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:51,920
What the hell?

374
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,879
I didn't notice
when I took them off the line.

375
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,359
Fucking kids!

376
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,359
Let's get going.
We'll pick up new ones on the way.

377
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,239
I have to buy typewriter ribbon as well.
This is crazy!

378
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,720
-Tina!
-I'm full. Anyway, I'm off to town.

379
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,920
-I'll take the little boat.
-What are you going to do?

380
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,680
-What are you going to do?
-All kinds of things.

381
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,399
I'm going to a movie tonight.

382
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,320
I'll sleep at Lena's.

383
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,599
Okay, is that his name now? Lennart?

384
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,520
John Jr and I
will go to my mother's for a week.

385
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:40,680
I guess you're working?

386
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,680
-Yes, I'm off to Malmö for a few days.
-Good. Then you won't miss us.

387
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,600
So what shall I say to Richter?

388
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,200
Tell him I'm away until Monday,
but that he can come then.

389
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,280
Hi. Yes, I'm off to Malmö now.

390
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,640
That means, to you.

391
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,680
We'll have a little crayfish party.

392
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:21,720
I have some in the freezer at home.

393
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,519
Then a Dopff Dry
and a really smelly cheese.

394
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,439
No, she's gone
to her mother's with John Jr.

395
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:36,720
Four days. Just us...

396
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,520
Anna.

397
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,239
-What is it, John?
-Nothing.

398
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,560
-Where are the crayfish?
-Screw the crayfish!

399
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,359
-You're hurting me.
-I love you.

400
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,680
I love you like hell! Do you hear?

401
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,280
Everything's finished.

402
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,839
No!

403
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,040
It starts now. Life starts now!

404
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,120
God, John.
If only you knew what you mean to me.

405
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,640
I've found a kind of peace
these past few months.

406
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:45,000
I've never written so much. Look.

407
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,760
-Can I read it?
-No...!

408
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,200
Later. I have to rewrite and rewrite.

409
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,000
Turn the words and chew them over.

410
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,600
Do you think it could always be like this?

411
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,800
Come.

412
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,159
-Does Stig know where you live now?
-No.

413
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,720
I don't think so.

414
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,839
I'll sleep in the study from now on
so you won't have my snoring.

415
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,280
That's very good.

416
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,040
You're seldom here, anyway.

417
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,960
And when you are,
you're just irritated when I read in bed.

418
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,799
Well, you don't like being woken up
when I come home late.

419
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,679
Exactly.

420
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,840
I can have the window open
without you going crazy.

421
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,960
Yup.
And I can have the sheets all to myself.

422
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:52,800
What do you mean?

423
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,040
I mean exactly what I say.

424
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:35,880
Is anyone there?

425
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,160
...the latest election.

426
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,239
Postal votes could decide, but the Green
Party will hold the balance of power.

427
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,960
"We've won a great victory,"
said Prime Minister Olof Palme last night,

428
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,120
who, visibly relieved...

429
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:23,120
Now we're going to have an orgy

430
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,360
of champagne and omelet!

431
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:32,520
And if you get a splash of champagne

432
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,999
then everything becomes intoxicating...

433
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,480
It's nice being in the rain with you.

434
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:50,360
Such warm rain! Are we in Hawaii?

435
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:53,640
-No, we're in Hönefoss.
-Hönefoss!

436
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,240
Yeah!

437
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,920
What is it?

438
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,680
I feel weird.

439
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,000
What is it?

440
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,519
I can't explain it.

441
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:13,479
No! What's up with you?

442
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,719
-It's as if someone was watching us.
-There's not even a window.

443
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,879
I've felt it all day.

444
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,799
It felt like someone was following me
in the park yesterday.

445
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,480
-You're just imagining it.
-Yes...

446
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:37,119
-I haven't heard from Stig.
-He doesn't know where you live.

447
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,439
-He could have called the publisher.
-It's good he's dropped it.

448
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,719
I don't want to be in here.
Let's go into the room.

449
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:51,920
I'm sorry I have things to do.
I have to have Mankiewicz

450
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:55,760
to dinner at home
and go with him to London tomorrow.

451
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,960
Yes, I know.

452
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:02,000
Goodbye, John.

453
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,240
What is it?

454
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,200
I think you're good.

455
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,440
I think you're very good.

456
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,199
I know what you're doing!
You don't fool me! I have contacts!

457
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,159
Watch out, you assholes. Watch out!

458
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:53,880
-You're a hussy!
-What?

459
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,200
-You're nervous, you're imagining things.
-But I heard it.

460
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:21,440
And someone's after me on the street.

461
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,320
That building's creepy.
Your damn building!

462
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:26,640
No, it's not true!

463
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,000
-You don't believe me?
-No.

464
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:31,640
I just called him.

465
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,480
Yes, and...

466
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:36,480
Like that. And he said...

467
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,640
WHY DO YOU EAT SO MANY ORANGES?

468
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,600
-You want any?
-No thanks.

469
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,200
It must be some kid who wrote that.

470
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,000
You don't believe me.
You think I made it up?

471
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,920
-No...
-Yes, you do.

472
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,440
No, seriously, I think it's
some young guy who's...

473
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:05,360
...got the hots for you. He follows
you around and scribbles stuff like that.

474
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,880
There are no young guys in the building.

475
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,799
Just that horrible old man one floor down.

476
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,119
-I haven't seen anyone on the first floor.
-A Volvo director, lives in Gothenburg.

477
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,360
He's very rarely here.
The other apartments are empty.

478
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,480
There's a pimply-faced guy
in the grocery store sometimes.

479
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,039
Then it's him! The oranges!

480
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,440
Solved.

481
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:48,879
There is someone. There's someone...

482
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,239
John? Someone's been here.

483
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,800
Yes, I'm sure. My manuscript. It was in
the drawer and I found it on the highboy.

484
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,039
It was me.

485
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,040
I looked at it last night
and forgot to put it back.

486
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,759
I know you didn't want me to read it,
but I couldn't help it.

487
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,039
Don't worry.
I'll see you this evening at seven.

488
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,920
Yeah. Bye.

489
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,080
-Is the poetess acting up?
-No.

490
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,840
It was nothing. So, where were we?

491
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,640
-We were going through remainders.
-Yes.

492
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,880
No...

493
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,319
Help!

494
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:38,919
Help!

495
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,319
Open! Help!

496
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,200
I know who you are. I know everything.
Instruments are recording it.

497
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,519
You won't fool me!

498
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,679
Cla... Clara!

499
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:13,479
Clara!

500
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,960
Clara!

501
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,360
Clara!

502
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,880
How are you? Clara? Clara!

503
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,680
-Shouldn't I take you to the hospital?
-No, I'm okay now.

504
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,919
John? Someone must have been here.
The window was closed.

505
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,959
Clara. They blew shut.
They weren't hooked open.

506
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,000
You had them open to air.

507
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,400
The door over there also blew shut. Look.

508
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,640
When I shut the door,
this thing falls down.

509
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,360
-What about the window catch?
-It's so worn out.

510
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,079
It's lucky you came!

511
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,119
We have to change the lock. Promise me?

512
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,520
Stay with me.

513
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:16,920
John?

514
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,640
What are you doing here at this time?

515
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,039
What are you doing in here?

516
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,680
Hasse and I are doing a paper called
"Stockholm's Blood Broadsheet."

517
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,440
I'm writing a story about a guy
called Peter who meets a werewolf...

518
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,440
How many times have I told you
not to touch Dad's things?

519
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,640
-But I just...
-Why can't...? I'm sorry!

520
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:49,599
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

521
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,440
I got upset. Don't cry. I didn't mean it.

522
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:57,159
John, you know what?

523
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,280
At work I have a machine
that can photograph and copy papers.

524
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,799
When your paper is ready
I could make several copies for you.

525
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,999
My darling John.

526
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:16,239
I like you so much...

527
00:57:30,399 --> 00:57:33,080
A packet of crispbread, please.

528
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:37,440
-Crispbread... No oranges today?
-No!

529
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,320
-No, thanks.
-Orange juice is healthy.

530
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,559
But the lady is one of them that only
drinks Champagne wine, right? I know.

531
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,720
It's a crappy novel
he's written this time.

532
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,120
On the contrary, it's his best book.

533
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:56,520
You lost your nose, John?

534
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,600
Is your little poetess
sucking the juice out of you?

535
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,079
-Fucking asshole! Shut up!
-Are you crazy? What are you doing?

536
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:17,199
-Think I don't know? I don't give a shit!
-What? I don't understand.

537
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,319
Maybe I'm naive, but I love Clara.

538
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,120
I live at home only for the kids.
Anna is nothing to me!

539
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,399
I didn't mean what I said, John.
I was kidding. It was a joke.

540
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,879
You have a fucking annoying
sense of humor!

541
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,999
I was home
when you thought I was in Malmö.

542
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,680
I saw your clothes and I saw you with...

543
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,159
Oh, shit. You saw us?

544
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:48,560
I love her. I know she loves me.

545
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,159
I'm really careful.

546
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,200
It disgusts me!

547
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,000
-And you disgust me!
-Just listen!

548
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,160
-We're two adults!
-We're old friends! Fucking hell!

549
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,919
John...

550
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,520
Okay, I'll end it with her today.
If you say so, I'll end it with her. Okay?

551
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,879
That's the sleaziest thing I ever heard.
Get out!

552
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,639
I don't give a shit what you both do.

553
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,839
Okay. I'll go to the Frankfurt Book Fair
so you won't see me for a week.

554
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:33,800
If only it was forever!

555
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,760
Clara is here. She seems very upset.

556
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,760
-Do you want me to...
-Yeah.

557
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,600
-What is it?
-I can't stay there. I can't.

558
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,960
-Calm down, Calm down...
-I can't, I can't.

559
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,280
-I've made an important decision.
-What?

560
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:11,079
I'm moving in with you. For good.

561
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:17,840
-What about Anna? The kids?
-Well, it is what it is.

562
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,560
-It's not working. I'm getting a divorce.
-Are you sure?

563
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,399
Yes, because... Because...

564
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,880
Because you are very good.

565
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,960
So, here's a little kissing party...

566
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:47,840
Sorry, barging in to
the lovefest like this. But..

567
01:00:47,919 --> 01:00:51,240
-I heard Clara was here so I...
-Yes, what is it?

568
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,239
Well, good news.
Your poetry collection sold out.

569
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,080
Not bad! We've printed
a new edition of 6,000 copies.

570
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,840
It's more than we've done for years
for a little book of poems.

571
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:09,600
-That's great. I'd never have believed it.
-But I did. I knew it!

572
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,560
-And Clara's almost finished a new one.
-Good to hear!

573
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:15,639
8,000 copies for the first edition.

574
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,240
-Take it easy. We have to see it first.
-You've read it.

575
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,679
-A little bit, anyway.
-Yeah...

576
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,919
Yes, it seems exciting.

577
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,719
Well, then maybe
I should leave the young lovers.

578
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,720
Yeah. Sure.

579
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:43,239
-Tonight we'll have an engagement party!
-Oh, you're so good!

580
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,400
Go and change into your best dress
and I'll pick you up at 7:30.

581
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,240
Cheers.

582
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,399
-To our young happiness.
-Cheers.

583
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,599
-Have you spoken to your wife?
-Yes, I've spoken to her.

584
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,079
She took it very coolly. She just said,
"That's good John."

585
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,400
"I won't have to wash
your underwear anymore."

586
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,359
It feels terrible. I like her a lot.

587
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,360
I have loved her.

588
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,400
I don't anymore.

589
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:34,719
I've started looking for a proper
apartment. I've spoken to an agent.

590
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,000
A three-room apartment on Östermalm.
I think I'm going to make it a five-room.

591
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,759
-We have to live respectably.
-It costs money.

592
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:47,160
Yes it does, but there are the means here.

593
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,879
I'm going to have you,
just for your means.

594
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,319
Wait! Wait, I know her!

595
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:22,280
-I know her! It's my...
-Yes it is! It's your fault!

596
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:24,960
You poisoned my eggs.
There are spots on all of them!

597
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,400
-Go to hell. I know you!
-Lie down!

598
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:41,280
He's going.
Now we're alone in the whole building.

599
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,640
He was creepy.
It must have been him all along.

600
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,319
Let's say so. If it was anyone.

601
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,480
Of course it was him who wrote
on the door. About oranges.

602
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,280
-I bought you some oranges.
-I hate oranges!

603
01:04:08,919 --> 01:04:12,000
Oh, it's perfect, perfect!

604
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,239
Far removed from all those powder sauces!
Taste.

605
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,200
I have to resort to French.
It tastes magnifique.

606
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:30,159
When we were at Askholmen in winter
and were iceboating, Stig said,

607
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,879
"If you stay you'll go back to Beckis."

608
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,320
What did he mean?

609
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:40,440
He meant what he said.

610
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,799
We met there. At Beckomberga.

611
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,239
-The nuthouse.
-You never told me.

612
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,600
You know, my mother was very beautiful.

613
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:55,839
Extremely beautiful.

614
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,159
And extremely tired. And Dad...

615
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,200
A farming bastard. Square.

616
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:05,640
Very sad.

617
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:07,479
And...

618
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:14,720
When I was 12, a bookseller turned up.

619
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,960
Slicked back hair.

620
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:22,599
He walked so damned beautifully.

621
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,560
So Mom left with him.

622
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:33,279
But he sold two books to Dad:
Character Building by H. I. Fosdick

623
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,680
and Marriage is Ordained by God
by Emil Löfstedt.

624
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,079
Marriage isn't ordained
by Emil Löfstedt, but by God.

625
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,000
-Don't kid around, go on.
-Yeah.

626
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,239
But he's a very good father.

627
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:54,320
Not Emil Löfstedt, but God... No, Dad!

628
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:58,800
So, I was out there on the farm with him.

629
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,360
Nothing happened.
Then we had a fight one day

630
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:12,560
because I wanted to learn to ride
a motorbike and he didn't want me to.

631
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,600
So I threw a wooden clog at his head.

632
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,639
And I took the train to the city
to stay with Mom.

633
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,560
You look nuts
with that sauce on your nose!

634
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,240
It's written: "It starts with a pin and
ends with a silver bowl." But it's wrong.

635
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:44,400
I started with a silver bowl,
an antique from 1755.

636
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:47,840
That belonged to the book peddler.

637
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:54,240
So Mom reported me to the police.

638
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:00,000
That was impossible for me.

639
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,360
She just didn't care.

640
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:06,440
You understand?

641
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,360
There was a guy that...

642
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,400
...cared a little bit about me.

643
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:19,760
Jan-Erik Johansson was his name.

644
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:24,759
He was what you'd call an addict
of stimulating neurological substances.

645
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,320
Well...

646
01:07:27,999 --> 01:07:30,480
I swallowed 100 tablets.

647
01:07:31,479 --> 01:07:33,639
Ended up in the nuthouse.

648
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,720
That's where I met Stig.

649
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:41,439
Then I wrote a thousand poems...

650
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,040
...and was rejected.
And rejected. And rejected.

651
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:50,240
And I'm here now.

652
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,880
It's no more remarkable than that.

653
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,960
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrogate you.

654
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I love you.

655
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,160
You're very good, you mean.

656
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,360
Promise me we'll never marry.

657
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:14,600
Because marriage
is only ordained by Emil Löfstedt.

658
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:19,119
Everyone is unhappy. Besides you and me.

659
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:17,559
James?

660
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,440
James?

661
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,320
Here kitty...

662
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,199
Did James get out
when you left this morning?

663
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,720
Well, you know how he is.
He could be gone for days.

664
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,800
No, I don't want anything, thanks.
I'm sure. Eat before you come.

665
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,399
No, I'm fine.

666
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,720
See you. Bye.

667
01:10:18,519 --> 01:10:20,079
Fallgren.

668
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:22,560
What?

669
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,520
Leave John Hjortfelt the fuck alone!

670
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:29,880
You've broken up a happy marriage
that lasted almost 20 years.

671
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,799
Get out of town. Go to hell!

672
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,240
DAYS OF ASHES
NIGHTS OF IRON

673
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:43,680
I thought the title was so good, I asked
Folke to put a cover together now.

674
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:47,199
-Huh?
-Yeah.

675
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,360
I don't know. Maybe she'll never...

676
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:55,839
A weirdo called Silt or something
called and said you must come.

677
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,440
I don't know any damn Silt!

678
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,000
It was about Clara.
He says he works at the grocery store.

679
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:05,720
Really? I'm sorry, Jens.
I have to go there.

680
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,720
It's been a bit tough lately. I'm sorry.

681
01:11:19,599 --> 01:11:20,760
Clara?

682
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,120
Oh, good God!

683
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,519
Hello, anyone here? Hello, Mr. Silt?

684
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,920
My name's not Silt.
It's Schüllt! S-C-H-Ü-L-L-T!

685
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,079
-You called about a woman...?
-Miss Fallgren is here.

686
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,759
What's happened?

687
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,120
Totally nuts. Dumb!

688
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,199
How are you? I'm here...

689
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,040
It's probably this.

690
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,480
The bag was hanging on her doorknob.

691
01:11:58,839 --> 01:12:03,600
It smells of almonds. That's prussic acid.
I worked on boats, we used that for rats.

692
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,880
Okay, calm down.

693
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,560
She went crazy. Screaming and running
around so the windows almost broke.

694
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,320
-Sit up a bit.
-I won't go up there again!

695
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,800
I promise, we'll never go again.
Could you please call a taxi?

696
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,240
Sure. Completely screwed up, right?

697
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:27,360
She's not suffering from any
acute psychosis. I wouldn't say that.

698
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:33,240
It's more a psychic trauma in conjunction

699
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,999
with heavy alcohol consumption.

700
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:41,280
De-escalating is what she probably needs.
Calm it down.

701
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,519
We've identified some elements
of paranoid delusions that...

702
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,919
...of course allude to a persecution mania
somewhere at the heart of this.

703
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
However, I don't think it should evolve
into a palpable psychosis this time.

704
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,080
She'll rest here, maybe medicate and
gain strength. There are good chances...

705
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,640
I want to leave.

706
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,280
You just rest, take it easy,
go for long walks and listen to music.

707
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,920
It's so nice down there now.

708
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:18,519
But I'll get fat. Dad stuffs me with food.

709
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,439
I'll come and see you next weekend.
I'll take at least four days off.

710
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:27,399
Do you still think I'm good, though?

711
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,239
You're very good.

712
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,359
Next month
we'll get the apartment on Karlavägen.

713
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:38,360
You're very, very good.

714
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:56,840
-Are there two places free here?
-Yeah, sure.

715
01:13:56,919 --> 01:13:58,640
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

716
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:13,080
Hjortfelt?

717
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,359
Yes, Hjortfelt.

718
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,960
Clara, hi...

719
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,800
It's so nice to hear your voice.

720
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,439
You sound good.

721
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,279
I'm milking. Yeah... The cows.

722
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,239
And I feed them.

723
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,640
I help Agnes with the cooking
and I cuddle up to Dad.

724
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:46,160
The hell you do.

725
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,640
I shop and I take walks by the sea.

726
01:14:51,759 --> 01:14:54,120
Everything here is so simple.

727
01:14:56,319 --> 01:14:57,480
Yeah.

728
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,960
There's no one here following you.

729
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:05,000
You still think I imagined everything?

730
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,600
-I'm just reassuring you.
-You can't deny someone killed James.

731
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,839
-Or that they called and threatened me.
-No, that's true.

732
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,640
But it must have been a lunatic.

733
01:15:20,919 --> 01:15:23,679
But you're well now. I can see that.

734
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,680
I think I'll stay here for Christmas.

735
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,880
But we get the new apartment next week.
We have to get furniture and everything.

736
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,760
I have to, John. I can't.

737
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,440
-You are coming back to me?
-Yes.

738
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,520
I think so.

739
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,920
You have to!

740
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,080
We'll see.

741
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,960
One helluva partner! He's never here!

742
01:15:56,199 --> 01:15:58,800
He's been away for 14 days
with that one.

743
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,200
Shit, I hate that fucking damn poet!

744
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,720
She's hypnotized John!
Destroyed his marriage.

745
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:16,520
Let me tell you, Fia...

746
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,480
I could break that fucking bitch's neck!

747
01:16:21,759 --> 01:16:24,399
Olovsson and Hjortfelt. Hello!

748
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,559
No. No, he's not here.
He hasn't been here for a while.

749
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,920
Last Thursday already?

750
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,600
That's weird.

751
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,520
Yes, I promise to get in touch
as soon as I have any news. Bye.

752
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,359
John left Skåne on the 7th.

753
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,960
John?

754
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,879
Are you there?

755
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:50,960
John Halvar Hjortfelt, book publisher.

756
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,800
It seems to be suicide
with prussic acid or...

757
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,680
potassium cyanide.

758
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,760
But there's no bottle or vial.

759
01:18:01,839 --> 01:18:04,680
He could have
flushed them down the toilet.

760
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,719
Yeah, I guess that's possible.

761
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,800
There are no other fingerprints here
apart from his and a woman's.

762
01:18:12,879 --> 01:18:15,920
Clara. Clara Fallgren.

763
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:19,320
She lives here, but...

764
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:24,480
She's in Skåne now. She's in Skåne.

765
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,040
I got the keys
from John before he went there.

766
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,560
Could she have written this?

767
01:18:32,432 --> 01:18:36,272
It's an unusual style. I think
only electrical typewriters have it.

768
01:18:36,348 --> 01:18:37,882
NO MORE ICEBOATING!

769
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:42,039
Was Mr. Hjortfelt
very depressed when you parted?

770
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,160
No.

771
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,560
He...

772
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,639
He was a bit sad.

773
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,400
-He wasn't like that.
-Sit down, Miss.

774
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,799
So many strange things happened in that
building. Someone was following me.

775
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,440
It's quite sad
when something like this happens.

776
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,280
But...

777
01:19:07,959 --> 01:19:11,679
-You'd ended your relationship, had you?
-No.

778
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,079
I just said I wanted to stay home
with my father for a while. It's Stig's.

779
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,440
NO MORE ICEBOATING!

780
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,320
Sorry?

781
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:23,040
No, nothing.

782
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:31,280
Yeah. Yes, it's me.

783
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,760
Yes, I know.

784
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,399
No, I'm busy. Can I call you back?

785
01:19:40,599 --> 01:19:43,400
-No, no.
-I understand you better than you think.

786
01:19:44,799 --> 01:19:47,840
-If it's too much, you can come out to us.
-Yeah.

787
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,920
Bye.

788
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:56,480
I'm very sorry. You weren't
meant to meet like this. This way.

789
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,840
That was unnecessary. Unpleasant.

790
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:23,480
Mrs. Hjortfelt
wasn't meant to come in like this.

791
01:20:23,559 --> 01:20:26,600
It doesn't matter.
We know each other well.

792
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:29,079
-Can I leave?
-Sure.

793
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:04,119
Yeah?

794
01:21:04,839 --> 01:21:07,119
-Is Stig at home?
-Stig?

795
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,719
Yes, Stig.
Doesn't Stig Svensson live here?

796
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,959
No, he's dead. He hanged himself
last summer. When his girlfriend left him.

797
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,080
Taxi!

798
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,200
-Yes, where do you want to go?
-I don't really know.

799
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:21,000
-Yes, go to Lidingö.
-Lidingö?

800
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:25,880
-15 Sigtrygsvägen.
-15 Sigtrygsvägen. Off we go.

801
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,639
Hello.

802
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,959
Hello, Clara. You've come to see us?

803
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:48,920
Yes. I have no one.
I don't know who to talk to.

804
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:51,320
I just dropped
the kids off at my mother's.

805
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,719
I'm going to Askholmen until Sunday.

806
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,000
-You could come with.
-Something awful has happened.

807
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,560
You can tell me. Jump in.

808
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:01,800
It's weird that you and I are here. Yes...

809
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,679
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

810
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,720
But we have something in common.
John's dead body.

811
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,520
I can't take
that tough line of talk you have.

812
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,680
You know that John thought
I was unfaithful with his partner Carl?

813
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:24,680
Of all the men on this earth.

814
01:26:24,759 --> 01:26:28,839
-He never told me.
-Do you know your Othello?

815
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,079
"She was false as water.

816
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:36,000
"Thou art rash as fire,
to say that she was false.

817
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,119
"Oh, she was heavenly true!"

818
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,760
-Anna, you don't have to...
-Oh, yes I do.

819
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,279
I was heavenly true.

820
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,480
But it's true.

821
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:57,600
The relationship between us was quite cool
sexually speaking the past few years.

822
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:00,639
But still...

823
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:04,160
I loved him.

824
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,520
Can you understand that?

825
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:13,359
We lived together for almost 20 years.

826
01:27:13,959 --> 01:27:16,400
A marriage
isn't only carried through the bed.

827
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,440
And children.

828
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,240
And we knew exactly who wanted
what piece of chocolate in a mixed box!

829
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,639
It was stupid of me to come out here.

830
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,360
I'm sorry, Clara, that I got so worked up.

831
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:38,000
I'm not really like that. Hey...

832
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:41,319
Let's play some happy music! Huh?

833
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:45,560
Do you like Offenbach?

834
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:56,600
John loved Offenbach!

835
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,119
You don't want to dance? Okay, forget it!

836
01:28:04,599 --> 01:28:06,920
Let's have a drink.

837
01:28:06,999 --> 01:28:10,359
You wait here and listen quietly.

838
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:13,239
And I'll go and mix a martini.

839
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:14,919
There's no way I'm drinking that.

840
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,639
Don't you long to see your lover again?

841
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:22,320
-You cheap hussy.
-You must be crazy.

842
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:28,560
