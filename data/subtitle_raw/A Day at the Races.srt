1
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,255
This way to the sanitarium.

2
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:49,755
Free bus to the sanitarium.

3
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,862
This way to the Standish Sanitarium.
Standish San-- Standish San--

4
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,521
This-- This way to the Standish--

5
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,327
Stand-- Free bus. Free bus.
Standish Sanitarium.

6
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:06,040
Free bus to the sanitarium.
Just got room for a few more.

7
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,942
-Sanitarium?
-No, racetrack.

8
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,876
You don't wanna go there.
You're sick.

9
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,806
I'm going to the races!

10
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:17,245
All right. You want something hot
in the fifth race?

11
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:21,883
Sanitarium? Bus to the sanitarium.
Standish Sanitarium.

12
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:26,055
Free bus to the sanitarium.

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,720
It's no use, Tony.

14
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,732
If business keeps up like this,
I'm afraid I'll have to drive the car myself.

15
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,462
Oh, no, Miss Judy. You can't fire me.

16
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:38,664
-But what if I can't pay your salary?
-That's different.

17
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:41,402
You don't have to pay me,
but you can't fire me.

18
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,445
-Tony, you're sweet.
-Yeah. And don't worry, Miss Judy...

19
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,106
...I'm gonna get us some customers
if I have to make them sick myself.

20
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,718
Tony, I'm afraid we need
more than customers.

21
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:53,856
You don't understand.
I owe a great deal of money.

22
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:56,514
Far more than I can ever pay.

23
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:00,220
Let me see.
Who do I know that's rich?

24
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,695
How about that big, strong,
sick woman at the sanitarium?

25
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,630
-You mean Mrs. Upjohn?
-That's the one.

26
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,133
She'd lend you the money.

27
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:10,739
Oh, she's rich. Why, last week,
she gave me a dollar tip.

28
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,738
She did once offer to help.

29
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,241
But it doesn't seem right
to borrow from a patient.

30
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:17,709
-Then we make her a partner.
-Oh, Tony.

31
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,315
We gotta hurry
before she changes her mind.

32
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,517
Go ahead, Miss Judy.
There's Mrs. Upjohn now.

33
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:33,628
-But, Mrs. Upjohn--
-There's no use, doctor. I'm leaving!

34
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:36,761
Mr. Whitmore, I want my bill at once.

35
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,424
-Just as you say.
-What's the matter, Mrs. Upjohn?

36
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,002
It's no fault of yours, my dear.
It's the doctor.

37
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:45,004
Telling me I'm perfectly well
when I know I'm on the verge...

38
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:48,041
...of a nervous collapse.
Goodbye, Judy, dear.

39
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,605
Have the boy come up
and get my bags, please.

40
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,121
Gil! Oh, Gil!

41
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:09,732
-I'm glad you're here.
-What is it, honey?

42
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:13,562
Hold me tight. I'll be all right.

43
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:15,897
Come on, honey, tell me.

44
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,302
It's Mrs. Upjohn.

45
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:19,998
She's leaving.

46
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,634
Oh, let her leave. Say, I have something
here worth 1 00 Upjohns.

47
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,509
You don't understand.
I'm going to lose this place.

48
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:31,279
No, you're not. That's what I'm trying
to tell you. From me to you, with love.

49
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:34,651
Your radio contract. You've got it!

50
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,129
"Gelding, out of Honey Lamb
by Blue Bolt...

51
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:43,891
...two-year, Hi Hat."

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,732
-Why, Gil, this doesn't make sense.
-It's a horse, honey, a racehorse.

53
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:51,703
Perhaps I'm awfully stupid,
but what do we want with a horse?

54
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,274
I'll tell you. Horse wins race,
owner wins money.

55
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:57,936
Owner gives money to girl he loves.
Girl saves sanitarium. It's very simple.

56
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:01,140
Very simple?
But what happens if horse loses race?

57
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:05,720
Oh, but he can't lose. He's a wonder.
I picked him up for a song, only $1 500.

58
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,651
Fifteen hundred dollars?

59
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:11,126
That's all the money
you had in the world.

60
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,728
Well, I still have my job
singing at the casino.

61
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,229
Now, Gil. You return that horse at once
and get your money back.

62
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,300
You've got to go on
with your music.

63
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,495
You need money fast, more than
I could make 1 0 years of singing.

64
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:27,166
I don't care. I want you to be
a great singer, not a racetrack tout.

65
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:29,743
Oh, wait a minute.
That isn't fair!

66
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,881
-Are you going to return that horse?
-I can't. I just bought him.

67
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:36,541
You mean you don't want to. You'd rather
bet on a horse than on yourself.

68
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:40,155
-Of all the ungrateful people!
-What have I got to be grateful for?

69
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:43,884
You've thrown your career away on a long
shot and gambled away our happiness.

70
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,224
Here. Take your horse.
And I hope you're very happy with it.

71
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm going to someone who understands me,
to Dr. Hackenbush.

72
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,271
Dr. Hackenbush? Why, I never heard
of him. Has he a sanitarium?

73
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,171
The biggest in Florida, that's what he said.
Of course, I was never there.

74
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:05,838
Hugo, I mean, Dr. Hackenbush,
always insisted on treating me in my home.

75
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:09,212
I didn't know there was a thing
the matter with me until I met him.

76
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:20,456
Excuse, please.

77
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,225
We're getting a lot of customers since
they heard Dr. "Hackenapuss" is coming.

78
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,129
-Did you say Hackenbush?
-Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,135
I wonder if that could be
the same one.

80
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,897
Where does he come from?

81
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,066
-Where's your Hackenapuss come from?
-Palmville, Florida.

82
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:35,870
That's the one!

83
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,372
Why.... Why, Judy!

84
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,416
Why didn't you tell me
Dr. Hackenbush was coming here?

85
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:44,348
Dr. Hackenbush?

86
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,750
Oh, I'm so excited!

87
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,982
Judy, why don't you make him
chief of staff.

88
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,456
He'd do wonders for the sanitarium.

89
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:56,087
With Dr. Hackenbush in charge,
I might help you financially.

90
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:58,597
I don't say I will, but I might.

91
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:03,262
Oh, Mr. Whitmore, have my bags
sent right up. I'm staying!

92
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,369
-Who's Dr. Hackenbush?
-I don't know.

93
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:14,414
But if she wants a Hackenapuss,
she's going to get a Hackenapuss.

94
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,956
Inhale.

95
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,122
Exhale.

96
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,960
Inhale.

97
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:34,433
Exhale.

98
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,435
Inhale.

99
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:38,597
Exhale.

100
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:40,674
Inhale.

101
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:43,175
-Here's a telegram for you, doc.
-What does it say?

102
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,871
Well, goes on to say--
How should I know?

103
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,107
"Come up and take care
of Mrs. Upjohn. Stop.

104
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:51,685
You can write your own ticket. Stop.
Come at once, Standish Sanitarium."

105
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:54,721
Mrs. Upjohn. Ah, Emily.

106
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,451
She never forgot that hayride.

107
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,158
Don't she know you're a vet?

108
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:03,355
She's so in love with me, she doesn't know
anything. That's why she's in love with me.

109
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,297
They could throw a horse doctor in jail
for treating people.

110
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,495
They can throw a horse doctor in jail
for not paying his rent too.

111
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,072
-Up in there.
-What have I got to lo--?

112
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,967
Take one of those every half-mile.
And call me if there's any change.

113
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:47,234
Mr. Morgan, if I sign this, it means I turn
the sanitarium over to you today.

114
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,605
That's right,
and I'll give you $5000.

115
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,111
But the notes aren't due.
I've got almost a month.

116
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,944
This place has been losing money steadily.
You'll never be able to pay.

117
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,019
If you wait, I'll take it over,
and you won't get a cent.

118
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:03,818
As your business manager, Judy, I strongly
advise you to take Mr. Morgan's offer.

119
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:06,484
You're forgetting that doctor
Mrs. Upjohn recommended.

120
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,392
Surely with him in charge,
we'll be able to pay Mr. Morgan.

121
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,329
Are you going to take the advice
of a hysterical patient?

122
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,765
-Now, look here, Miss Standish--
-Judy!

123
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,565
-Judy, he's here! He's here!
-Why, who's here?

124
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,540
Dr. Hackenbush!

125
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,769
Are you going to sign that or not?

126
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:25,038
-No.
-Of course she's not going to sign it.

127
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:28,274
I have a month. I can at least
try this new doctor.

128
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:30,715
You're going to wish
you'd taken that check.

129
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,376
Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan!

130
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,752
-You fixed that, all right.
-How'd I know she was going to butt in?

131
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:40,327
-I'll get to work on this new doctor.
-Work fast.

132
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,227
With Dr. Hackenbush in charge,
I'm sure my trustees will let me help you.

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,961
-I think I'm better able to advise--
-I don't want to hear any more about it.

134
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:51,504
I can't stand this excitement.
I know this will cause a relapse.

135
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,544
Oh, my metabolism! Doctor!
Oh, doctor!

136
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,148
Here, boy. Here, boy.

137
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:03,080
Take these bags to my room,
and here's a dime for yourself.

138
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:07,018
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is Mr. Whitmore,
our business manager.

139
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,181
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Here's a quarter.

140
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,327
You mustn't take the doctor
too seriously.

141
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,656
He probably feels tired
after his long trip.

142
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,822
Why shouldn't I be tired?
Did you ever ride four on a motorcycle?

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,797
And me, top man.

144
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:23,666
This is Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush,
your new chief of staff.

145
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:27,770
And now, doctor,
I'd like you to meet Miss Standish.

146
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:29,934
Oh, doctor.

147
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,636
Doctor.

148
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,839
Just a moment,
while I calm these paralytics.

149
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,382
Oh, dear. Doctor.

150
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,578
Doctor, this is Miss Standish,
owner of the sanitarium.

151
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,449
-How do you do, Miss Standish?
-How do you do?

152
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,823
You're the prettiest owner
of a sanitarium I've ever seen.

153
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,521
-Thank you.
-You have a charming place here.

154
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,100
I knew your mother very well.

155
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,162
I'll let you in on a little secret.

156
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,001
Many, many years ago,
in the dear, dim past...

157
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,473
...I proposed to your mother.

158
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:05,679
-But that's my father.
-No wonder he turned me down.

159
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,240
Now, doctor, I'd like you
to meet your new associates.

160
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,648
Johnson, Bellevue Hospital, 1 91 8.

161
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,482
Franco, Johns Hopkins, '22.

162
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:17,922
-Wilmerding, Mayo brothers, '24.
-Dodge brothers, late '29.

163
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,426
Doctor, I'm happy to welcome
you as chief of staff.

164
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,827
I hope you'll be able to pull
the sanitarium out of its difficulties.

165
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,866
The sanitarium's having
a little financial trouble.

166
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,903
I get it. I'm not gonna get paid.
So long! Take it away!

167
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,506
Oh, no, no, no.
Doctor, please don't go.

168
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,337
-I'll take care of your salary.
-Oh, yeah?

169
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,809
The last job I had,
I had to take it out in trade.

170
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,141
And this is no butcher shop.

171
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,284
Not yet anyhow.

172
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,020
Judy, it seems to me,
if I may say so...

173
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,053
...we are making rather
a hasty decision.

174
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:51,125
Surely you don't question
the doctor's ability.

175
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,557
No. Not exactly.

176
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:57,028
But running a sanitarium calls
for a man with peculiar talents.

177
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,930
I've got the most peculiar talents
of any doctor you ever met.

178
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:04,004
I'm satisfied with Mrs. Upjohn's
recommendations.

179
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:07,574
If you'll excuse me, I'll go
and bring in the rest of the staff.

180
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:11,406
Why don't you go out and bring in
something. Preferably your resignation.

181
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,282
Tell me, Dr. Hackenbush...

182
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,715
...just what was your medical
background?

183
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,821
-Medically?
-Yes.

184
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,653
Well, at the age of 1 5, I got a job
in a drugstore filling prescriptions.

185
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,227
Don't you have to be 21
to fill prescriptions?

186
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:30,854
Well, that's for grownups.
I just filled them for children.

187
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,192
No, no, doctor.

188
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,770
I mean, where did you get your training
as a physician?

189
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh, well, to begin with,
I took four years at Vassar.

190
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:45,375
-Vassar? But that's a girls' college.
-I found that out the third year.

191
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,483
I'd have been there yet, but I went out
for the swimming team.

192
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,747
The doctor seems reluctant
to discuss his medical experiences.

193
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,983
Well, medically, my experiences
have been most unexciting.

194
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,923
-Except during the flu epidemic.
-And what happened?

195
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,722
I got the flu.

196
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:07,096
-Oh, doctor, I think it's time for my pill.
-lx-nay on the ill-pay.

197
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,363
Now, you told me
to take them regularly.

198
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:18,972
Just a minute, Mrs. Upjohn.

199
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:22,982
-That looks like a horse pill to me.
-Oh, you've taken them before?

200
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:26,610
-Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?
-You have nothing to worry about.

201
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:30,384
The last patient I gave one of those to
won the Kentucky Derby.

202
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,049
May I examine this, please?

203
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,286
Do you actually give those
to your patients?

204
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,455
Isn't that awfully large for a pill?

205
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,966
It was too small for a basketball,
and I didn't know what to do with it.

206
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:44,071
Say, you're awfully large
for a pill yourself.

207
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,871
Dr. Wilmerding...

208
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,336
...just what is your opinion?

209
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:53,004
It must take a lot of water
to swallow that.

210
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,742
Nonsense. You can swallow that
with 5 gallons.

211
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,079
Isn't that a lot of water
for a patient to take?

212
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,279
Not if the patient
has a bridge in her mouth.

213
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:04,358
The water flows under, the patient walks
over and meets the pill on the other side.

214
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,756
So it's war!
I'm off to the battlefield!

215
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,456
No, that's from the racetrack.

216
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:15,661
-Racetrack? Well, what am I doing here?
-Oh, doctor, don't leave me!

217
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,010
Well, you won it, Stuffy.

218
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,651
Nice work, Stuffy.

219
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,655
I told you to lose that race.

220
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,868
Stuffy, where are you? Where's Stuffy?
Did you see my jockey?

221
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,947
Whoa. Please, Mr. Morgan,
Don't stay here.

222
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,447
You ought to beat the head
off that ornery devil!

223
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:05,086
Well, he only acts this way
when he sees or hears you.

224
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,420
I should have plugged that nag
when I owned him.

225
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,556
Please, Mr. Morgan,
don't stay here.

226
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,998
Calm down. He's gone now.
That's a boy.

227
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,099
You better stay out of Morgan's way
for a while.

228
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:28,642
Get your ice cream.
Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

229
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,876
Stuffy!

230
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,611
Hey, get out of there.

231
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,808
Hey, that was some ride
you put up.

232
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:39,181
I had 5 bucks right
on the nose.

233
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,017
I won 60 cents. Yeah.

234
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,920
Who you riding tomorrow?

235
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,357
What's the matter? What happened?

236
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,726
You're fired?
Oh, Morgan fired you, huh?

237
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:54,130
-He wanted you to throw the race?
-He wanted Stuffy to be crooked, eh?

238
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,066
You know he's honest.

239
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,306
He's honest, but you gotta
watch him a little.

240
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:02,171
Gil, why don't you give Stuffy a job.
Let him ride Hi Hat.

241
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:05,575
We can't afford a jockey. We haven't
enough money to eat on ourselves.

242
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:09,707
Eat, eat, eat. All the time eat.
We don't have to eat. I'll eat.

243
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,149
-Hey, you.
-Hello, sheriff.

244
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:14,721
-Have you got the money for the feed bill?
-You see--

245
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,858
You guys have been stalling me
for weeks.

246
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:20,120
Either I get some money right now,
or I'm taking Hi Hat.

247
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:23,958
Wait, wait.
I'll give you some money.

248
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,395
There you are.

249
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,196
Five dollars? That's not enough.
Come on. Well?

250
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:32,602
All right, all right.
I've got some more. Just....

251
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:33,969
There you are.

252
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:37,738
That makes 1 0. Chicken feed.
Come on, you've got some more.

253
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,177
Yeah, but it's hard to get at,
you know?

254
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,317
-Come on, come on.
-All right. Don't hurry.

255
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:46,250
I've got it someplace.
I know it's someplace.

256
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,083
Here. I knew it was someplace.

257
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,852
Well, that's 1 5.
Have you got any more?

258
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,689
-I'll let you know in a minute.
-Quit stalling. Come on, hurry.

259
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:58,230
All right, I've got some more,
but I can't hurry.

260
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,427
Hey, what are you doing? Cut it--
Get up. What is this? Cut it--

261
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,198
What are you trying to do?
Get up.

262
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,674
Here! Come back here!

263
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:16,848
Well, that's fine. Now we owe
the sheriff $1 20 and a sock.

264
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,453
It's a good thing Judy doesn't have
to depend on me.

265
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:25,059
-I can't even hold on to the horse.
-No? Well, we hold on to the horse.

266
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,861
Say, if we only had some dough.
I got a tip on Sun-Up.

267
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,300
Sun-Up? He's in the next race!
We don't got much time!

268
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,565
Hey, wait! What are we gonna use
for money?

269
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:43,477
Hey! What are you doing,
you crazy kook, you?

270
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,715
Hey, look, look!
Sun-Up, he's 1 0-to-1.

271
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:51,341
Oh, boy, are we gonna clean up,
1 0-to-1.

272
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,921
-We haven't any money to bet.
-Don't worry. I get us some money.

273
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,183
I find a sucker someplace.

274
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,726
Scram. I think I see a sucker coming now.
Get out of here.

275
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,831
Get your ice cream.

276
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,600
Two dollars on Sun-Up.

277
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:14,539
Hey. Hey, boss. Boss, come here.
You want something hot?

278
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,703
Not now. I just had lunch.
Anyhow, I don't like hot ice cream.

279
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:22,977
Hey, come here. I no sell ice cream.
That's fake to fool the police.

280
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:27,555
I sell tips on the horses. I got something
today can't lose. One dollar.

281
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:31,420
No. Some other time. I'm sorry.
I'm betting on Sun-Up. Some other time.

282
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:33,959
-Two dollars on Sun-Up.
-Hey, boss. Hey. Come here.

283
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,188
Sun-Up is the worst horse
on the track.

284
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,893
-I notice he wins all the time.
-Just because he comes in first.

285
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,038
I don't want him any better than first.
Two dollars on Sun-Up.

286
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,640
Hey, boss, come here.
Come here.

287
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:50,438
Suppose you bet on Sun-Up. What you
gonna get for your money? 2-to-1.

288
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:53,342
One dollar, and you'll remember me
all your life.

289
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:56,780
That's the most nauseating proposition
I ever had.

290
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:01,412
Come on. Come on.
You look like a sport. Come on, boss.

291
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,252
Don't be a crunger for one buck.

292
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,057
Thank you.

293
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,028
-What's this?
-That's the horse.

294
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,462
How'd he get in here?

295
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:17,503
Get your ice cream.
Tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

296
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,301
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L."

297
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,376
I had that same horse
when I had my eyes examined.

298
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:27,971
Hey, ice cream.

299
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,615
What about this optical illusion
you slipped me? I don't understand it.

300
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:34,722
That's not the real name of the horse.
That's the name in code.

301
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,414
Look in your codebook.

302
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,924
-What do you mean, "code"?
-Look in the codebook.

303
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,291
-That will tell you what horse you got.
-I haven't got any codebook.

304
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,728
-You don't got one?
-You know where I can get one?

305
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,269
Well, just by accident, I think
I've got one right here. Here you are.

306
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,065
-How much is it?
-That's free.

307
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,233
-Oh, thanks.
-Just a $1 printing charge.

308
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:58,339
Well, give me one without printing.
I'm sick of printing.

309
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:01,414
Come on. You want to win?

310
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,144
-Yeah, sure. Of course I want to win.
-Well, then you've got to have this.

311
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,618
But I don't want the savings
of a lifetime...

312
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,451
...wiped out in the twinkling
of an eye.

313
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:16,228
-Here.
-Thank you very much.

314
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,730
Ice cream....

315
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,860
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L, page 34."

316
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,372
Hey, ice cream, I can't make head
or tail out of this.

317
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:32,908
That's all right. Look in the master
codebook. That will tell you where to look.

318
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,242
Master code? I haven't got
any master codebook.

319
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,545
-You don't got a master codebook?
-Do you know where I can get one?

320
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,451
Well, just by accident, I think
I've got one right here. There you are.

321
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:46,321
A lot of quick accidents around here
for a quiet neighborhood.

322
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,726
-ls there a printing charge on this?
-No.

323
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:51,456
Oh, thanks.

324
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:54,397
Just a $2 delivery charge.

325
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,837
Delivery charge?
I'm standing right next to you.

326
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,271
Well, for such a short distance,
I make it $1.

327
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,811
Couldn't I move over here
and make it 50 cents?

328
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,438
Yes, but I'd move over here
and make it $1 just the same.

329
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,842
Say, maybe I'd better
open a charge account, eh?

330
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,282
You got some references?

331
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,218
The only one I know
around here is you.

332
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,223
That's no good.
You'll have to pay cash.

333
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:22,227
A little while ago, I could have put $2
on Sun-Up and avoided all this.

334
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,797
Yeah, throw your money away.
Thank you very much.

335
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,264
-I'm all set, huh?
-Yes, sir.

336
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:29,131
Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

337
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:33,263
-Master code, master code, plain code.
-Get your ice cream...

338
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:37,139
...tootsie-fruitsie.
Get your tootsie-fruitsie....

339
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:43,478
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L. The letter Z stands for J
unless the horse is a filly."

340
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:46,985
-Get your tootsie-fruitsie--
-Hey, tootsie-fruitsie.

341
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:50,613
-ls the horse a filly?
-I don't know. Look in your breeder's guide.

342
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,590
Get your ice cream....

343
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,390
What do you mean?
I haven't got any breeder's guide.

344
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,533
You haven't got a breeder's guide?

345
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,568
Not so loud. I don't want it to get around
that I haven't got a breeder's guide.

346
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,866
Even my best friends don't know
I haven't got a breeder's guide.

347
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:11,240
Well, boss, I feel pretty sorry for you,
walking around without a breeder's guide.

348
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,438
Why, you're just throwing
your money away...

349
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:16,049
...buying those other books
without a breeder's guide.

350
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,752
Where can I get one?
As though I didn't know.

351
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,727
One is no good.
You got to have the whole set.

352
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:33,333
Get your tootsie-fruitsie--

353
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,130
You know, all I wanted was a horse,
not a public library.

354
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,636
-What do you mean? How much is a set?
-One dollar.

355
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:41,298
-One dollar?
-Yeah. Four for $5.

356
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:44,502
Give me the four of them.
There's no use throwing away money.

357
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,976
All right, here you are.

358
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:48,548
This is all I'm buying too.
I didn't want so many--

359
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:51,686
-I thought you could do this quickly.
-There you are.

360
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:56,451
Six dollars on Sun-Up.

361
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:01,794
-Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.
-Breeder's guide.

362
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,863
Get your ice cream.

363
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:08,025
-"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L is Burns."
-Yeah, that's right.

364
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:09,465
-Burns?
-Yeah.

365
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,698
Some days it gives you the name
of the jockey instead of the horse.

366
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:17,504
You find out who jockey Burns is riding,
and that's the horse you bet on. It's easy.

367
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,546
Get your ice cream, tootsie-fruitsie.

368
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:23,878
I'm getting the idea of it.
I didn't get it for a long time.

369
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,452
It's pretty tricky when you don't
know it, isn't it?

370
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,088
It's not that book.

371
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,747
-It's not that book.
-It's not that book?

372
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:32,450
Oh, I see.

373
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:35,960
No. It's not that book.
Not that book.

374
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:43,663
-Nope. Nope. It's not that book.
-It's not?

375
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:45,637
No, you haven't got that book.

376
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,447
You've got it, huh?

377
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,653
I'll get it in a minute, though, won't l?

378
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:03,655
Get your tootsie-fruitsie.

379
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:07,157
I'm getting a fine tootsie-fruitsying
right here.

380
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:10,662
Get your ice cream.

381
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,935
-How much is it?
-One dollar.

382
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:17,503
-And it's the last book I'm buying.
-Sure, you don't need no more. Here.

383
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:20,835
Now, here's a....
Here's a $1 0 bill.

384
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,603
-Shoot the change, will you?
-I got no change.

385
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:26,246
I'll have to give you nine more books.
You don't mind.

386
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:28,143
-You take nine more books.
-Nine more?

387
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:32,218
-You don't handle any bookcases, do you?
-Well, you come tomorrow again.

388
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,447
-I didn't know that you needed--
-You're gonna win today.

389
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:38,024
I thought you just walk up
and bet on a horse.

390
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,855
-Open!
-Am I shedding books down there?

391
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,088
Close! Close! That's it.

392
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:45,460
It's a good thing I brought
my legs with me, eh?

393
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,727
-Now, what horse have I got?
-It's right here.

394
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,463
-I just heard the fella blowing his horn.
-Here it is.

395
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:53,836
Jockey Burns, 1 52.
That's Rosie.

396
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,534
-Rosie, yeah?
-Look! Oh, boy! Look, 40-to-1!

397
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,702
-40-to-1, huh?
-Oh, what a horse!

398
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,112
Am I gonna give that bookie a whipping!
I was going to bet on Sun-Up at 1 0-to-1.

399
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:05,685
-Look, it's 40-to-1.
-I'll show them a thing or two.

400
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,846
Hey, there, big boy.
Two dollars on Rosie, eh?

401
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:10,889
Sorry, that race is over.

402
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,357
-I say the race is over.
-Over? Who won?

403
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:16,691
-Sun-Up.
-Sun-Up! That's my horse! Sun-Up.

404
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:19,857
Sun-Up. Hurry up. Sun-Up.

405
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:26,065
Goodbye, boss. Goodbye. Sun-Up.
Ten, 20, 30-- Sun-Up! Forty, 50....

406
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:33,307
Get your tootsie-fruitsie. Nice ice cream.
Nice tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

407
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,944
-Oh, Miss Standish?
-Yes?

408
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,951
-These calls came while you were out.
-Oh, thank you.

409
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:48,295
Hello.

410
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,462
-Mr. Stewart?
-I'm still out.

411
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,466
I'm sorry. Miss Standish is still out.

412
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,630
Yes, Mr. Whitmore.

413
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,399
What about that call
to the Florida medical board?

414
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:02,805
What? Well, keep on trying.

415
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,536
Call me the moment you get it.

416
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:07,546
You can't even get any action
out of your telephone operator.

417
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:10,276
Don't worry. I'll get the dope
on that Florida quack.

418
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:15,321
Now, listen, I want to turn this place into
a gambling casino before the season ends.

419
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,288
With my racetrack, my nightclub
and this...

420
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,395
...I'll have every sucker in America here,
but every day counts.

421
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:24,760
-I'll let you know the moment I get the call.
-I'll be waiting.

422
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,034
Doctor, may I have one
of your photographs?

423
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:28,430
Why, I haven't one.

424
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:31,834
I could let you have my footprints,
but they're upstairs in my socks.

425
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,669
I want to announce your association
with the sanitarium.

426
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,834
We'll send your picture
to all the papers.

427
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,378
-Florida papers?
-Yes. It'd be wonderful publicity.

428
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:43,449
Publicity? We mustn't have any of that.
You know, the ethics of my profession.

429
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:45,882
But we have to get new patients.

430
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:49,512
Well, after all, the old patients
were good enough for your father.

431
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,989
Besides, who wants to see my picture?

432
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,620
I'm not a famous man. I'm just a simple
country doctor with horse sense.

433
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,197
Oh, you're too modest.

434
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,596
-We'll forget about the pictures.
-That's better.

435
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:03,533
And, doctor, remember,
I'm counting on you.

436
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,868
The success of the sanitarium
is in your hands.

437
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,203
Look, Miss Standish, suppose--
Suppose I were to tell you...

438
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,281
...that I'm not the doctor
you think I am.

439
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,577
Well, you're the only one
that can help me.

440
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,720
And do be nice to Mrs. Upjohn,
won't you?

441
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:25,258
Well, she's not exactly my type,
but for you, I'd make love to a crocodile.

442
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,054
Silly.

443
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:33,091
Have the florist send roses to Mrs. Upjohn.
Write "Emily, I love you" on the bill.

444
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,668
Just a moment, Dr. Hackenbush.

445
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,730
Yes, Mr. Whitmore.

446
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,502
No, I haven't been able to get that call
through to the Florida medical board.

447
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:45,578
Well, I'm doing the best I can.
It ought to be here any minute.

448
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:49,615
If that call's what I think, she can cancel
those roses and make it lilies for me.

449
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:55,047
Get me Mr. Whitmore.

450
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,126
-Hello?
-Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore.

451
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,593
All right. Hello?

452
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,232
Florida medical board.
Good morning.

453
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,198
I'd like to talk to the man
in charge of the records, please.

454
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,497
Record department?
Just a moment, sugar.

455
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:14,773
Record department.
Colonel Hawkins talking.

456
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,276
Colonel Hawkins, did you get a wire
from me regarding Dr. Hackenbush?

457
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:22,715
I'm sorry, sir, but there's a hurricane
blowing down here...

458
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:25,546
...and you'll have to talk
a little louder.

459
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,188
It certainly is the windiest day
we ever did have.

460
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,618
It certainly is windy!

461
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,127
I want to know about Dr. Hackenbush!

462
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,698
-Yes?
-Whitmore, cut out that squawking.

463
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,064
The patients are all complaining.

464
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:46,332
And I hope, sir, that that's
the information that you require.

465
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:50,103
I'm sorry, colonel. I didn't hear it.
I was called to the Dictograph.

466
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,647
-What was that you said, sir?
-I was called to the Dictograph!

467
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:02,044
Whitmore, one more yelp out of you,
and I'll have you bounced out of here.

468
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:05,056
And I trust, sir, that that answers
your question.

469
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:08,389
I'm terribly sorry, colonel.
I didn't hear you.

470
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,997
I can't hear you. You'll have to talk
a bit louder.

471
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:15,500
I want to find out something
about Hackenbush!

472
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,505
-Well, what is it now?
-That's the last time...

473
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,734
...I'm gonna warn you
about that yowling.

474
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,772
And in conclusion,
let me say--

475
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:29,007
I'm sorry, colonel. What was
that you said about Hackenbush?

476
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,518
Hacken-- You mean, Dr. Hackenbush?
Oh, no. He's not here.

477
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,156
I know he's not there. He's here!

478
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:39,122
Then what are you
bothering me for, Yankee?

479
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:42,286
But I want to know something
about his Florida record.

480
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:44,295
Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore.

481
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:46,195
Operator, will you get off the line?!

482
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,097
-Hello? Hello, colonel.
-Yes?

483
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,297
Are you sure you're speaking
of Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush?

484
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:55,807
-Who?
-Hugo Z. Hackenbush!

485
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:57,672
Who's calling him?

486
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,316
-The Standish Sanitarium.
-Yeah, that's where he works.

487
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:06,181
Say, I understand he's doing
a mighty fine job up there.

488
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:07,844
I....

489
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:13,291
I want to get some information
regarding his qualifications for the job.

490
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:16,021
-What job?
-As head of the sanitarium!

491
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:18,062
-Who?
-Hackenbush!

492
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,632
-Whitmore, are you calling me?
-No, you sap!

493
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:31,745
-Hello.
-Yes, now, what was that name?

494
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:34,338
Hackenbush. Hackenbush!

495
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:40,048
Well, as soon as he comes in,
I'll have him get in touch with you.

496
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,856
Hey, you see that sourpuss?

497
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,124
That's Whitmore,
the man you gotta watch.

498
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,325
You see, he's no good.
He's in with Morgan...

499
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:58,632
...and I think they're trying to get
the sanitarium away from Miss Judy.

500
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,133
Hey, hey! No, no, no.

501
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,802
You no gonna fight him.
You gonna watch him.

502
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,073
You gotta watch him like a hawk.

503
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:11,741
That's it. Not so fast.
No, not so fast.

504
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,218
First, I gotta get you
in here as a patient...

505
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:16,550
...or else Whitmore's going
to get wise to you.

506
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:19,522
Come on, I take you to the doctor.

507
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:23,790
Stuffy! Stuffy! Hey, come here.
Hey, he won't hurt you.

508
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,401
No, no, come here.
This fella's a nice doctor.

509
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:31,130
You're hungry, eh?
You want some ice cream?

510
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,070
You want a nice, big steak?
With spinach?

511
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:36,836
All right, all right.
No spinach. No spinach.

512
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:40,503
Apple pie? And beautiful nurses?

513
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:43,446
Oh, baby, come on.
You're gonna get a nurse.

514
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:45,745
Oh, my, you're gonna get plenty.

515
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:48,055
-Have you seen Dr. Hackenbush?
-No, doctor.

516
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:49,814
Go find him.
Mrs. Upjohn wants him.

517
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:54,257
-What's the matter with Mrs. Upjohn?
-Nothing, in its most violent form.

518
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,063
-Pick me up at 5.
-Yes, sir.

519
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,439
-May I have an okay on this, please?
-I'm too busy right now.

520
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:12,512
I'll put the O on now
and come back later for the K.

521
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,545
-Dr. Hackenbush.
-A little later.

522
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:16,581
-Get me the Turkish bath.
-Yes, sir.

523
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:19,083
Dr. Hackenbush, Mrs. Upjohn
is complaining again...

524
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:21,414
...and these x-rays show
nothing wrong with her.

525
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:25,025
Is that so? Who are you gonna believe,
me or those crooked x-rays?

526
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,661
Doctor, the Turkish bath.

527
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:32,266
Hello? Gus, will you look in the steam room
and see if my frankfurters are done?

528
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:36,604
That will be all.
I have some important research.

529
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,466
Now....

530
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,456
Excuse me.

531
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:59,425
Oh, so you're the doctor.

532
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:02,154
Yeah, remember me?
I used to be in the book business.

533
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,888
Hey, forget about that, doc.

534
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,932
-I got some good news for you.
-Yeah? What are the odds?

535
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:09,592
No, no, it's no horse.
I got a patient for you.

536
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:11,864
Oh, a patient? Oh, fine.
What size?

537
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,308
-You didn't get him here any too soon.
-Hey, Stuffy!

538
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:18,377
Sit down here till I snatch you
from the jaws of death.

539
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:22,312
-Just sit quietly.
-Sit down.

540
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,623
Either he's dead,
or my watch has stopped.

541
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,195
He's a good doctor.

542
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:40,527
Knows his business.

543
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,097
Singing doctor.

544
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,904
Here you are. Oh, come on.
This isn't gonna hurt.

545
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,708
-Come on, everybody gets that.
-Open up those pearly gates.

546
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:57,544
Flip this under your flapper. Attaboy.

547
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:01,177
-Didn't hurt, did it, huh?
-He's pretty sick, eh, doc?

548
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,730
Well, that temperature
certainly went down fast.

549
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:18,832
Hey, don't drink that poison!
That's $4 an ounce.

550
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,075
We better put him to bed.
He looks awfully sick today.

551
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:23,710
Better get him a nurse too.

552
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:26,608
If he thinks that, he'll go to bed.

553
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:32,342
-Come on.
-There, now. Take it easy, will you?

554
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,750
He's been a doctor for years,
this fella.

555
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:38,323
I've been a doctor longer than you've been
a patient, I'll tell you that.

556
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,927
Come on. Why do you do like that?

557
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:43,825
What do you think,
he's gonna play with you?

558
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:50,765
No, don't look at me.
Let me look at you, huh?

559
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:54,671
No.

560
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,572
Don't look at me.
What do you think I am, a peepshow?

561
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,872
Get away there, will you?

562
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,811
It's rather a strange-looking sight.

563
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:08,945
-Yeah, it's serious, huh, doc?
-I haven't seen anything like this in years.

564
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:12,490
The last time I saw a head like that
was in a bottle of formaldehyde.

565
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,027
-I told you he was sick.
-That's all pure desiccation along there.

566
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:20,897
He's got about a 1 5-percent metabolism
with an overactive thyroid...

567
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:23,866
...and a glandular affectation
of about 3 percent.

568
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,701
-That's bad, huh?
-With a 1 -percent mentality.

569
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:32,479
He's what we designate
as the crummy, moronic type.

570
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:38,409
This is the most gruesome-looking
piece of blubber I've ever peered at.

571
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,747
Hey, doc! Hey, doc.

572
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:44,824
You got the looking glass turned around.
You're looking at yourself.

573
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:47,593
I knew it all the time.

574
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:50,492
That was a good joke on all of us,
wasn't it?

575
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,062
Let's do it again sometime, huh?

576
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,534
Say, "Ah."

577
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,470
Louder.

578
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:04,307
Louder!

579
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:08,479
-Hey, doc, where you going?
-I'm going to the ear doctor. I'm deaf.

580
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:11,379
Come on back. It's not you. It's him.

581
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:14,646
Sometimes, I'm not sure
who's getting the examination here.

582
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:18,250
Take it easy, now, huh?

583
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,660
Say, am I stewed,
or did a grapefruit just fly past?

584
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:32,829
I don't see nothing.

585
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,585
If that's his Adam's apple,
he's got yellow fever.

586
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,188
-He's got ingrown balloons.
-He has, huh?

587
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,757
Well, we'll soon find out.

588
00:36:57,331 --> 00:37:00,459
-Hold that till I get a rock.
-He's got a blister on his tongue.

589
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,626
-ls that what it is?
-I think he's a Ubangi.

590
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,966
Well, I'll get the hammer
and "Ubangi" that right off.

591
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,167
I had a case like that once in Dusseldorf
many years ago, and--

592
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:13,108
Say, it's grown considerably,
hasn't it, huh?

593
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:17,115
-What's that hairy fungus all over it?
-Some fungus, eh, doc?

594
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:19,617
Not a great deal, no.

595
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:22,722
-Well--
-You're making a mistake. That's his head.

596
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,791
If that's his head,
he's making a mistake, not me.

597
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:31,329
I can't do anything for him.
That's a case for Frank Buck.

598
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:34,796
Put him in the room
till Frank Buck gets here.

599
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:38,302
Fine. Shall we say a 50-buck room,
or would you prefer something better?

600
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:40,531
-We'll take something better.
-That's nice.

601
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:45,236
-But we'll talk about the money tomorrow.
-Oh, no. Money on the line, or out you go.

602
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:51,251
"To Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush,
for saving my horse."

603
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:54,547
-Come here with that watch.
-You, a horse doctor?

604
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:57,088
-A little easy with that talk.
-A horse doctor.

605
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:00,421
-Don't mention that word around here.
-Hey, that's terrible.

606
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:02,824
I'm gonna tell Miss Judy quick.

607
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,897
No. That's no good.

608
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:08,661
Miss Judy, she's depending on you.
A horse doctor.

609
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:12,772
Now, listen, boys, I admit it.
You've caught me with my coat down.

610
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,774
-Well, it's been nice knowing you.
-Oh, no, you don't. Oh, no.

611
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:19,538
Let's get together.
I'm open to any kind of proposition.

612
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,875
All right, you stick on this job.

613
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,951
You make Mrs. Upjohn happy,
or we're gonna have you thrown in jail.

614
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,418
Well, that doesn't leave me
much choice, does it?

615
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:31,218
Nobody must know
you're a horse doctor.

616
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:36,291
You make one false move,
and we fix you good.

617
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:41,299
I hate to admit it,
but I haven't got a leg to stand on.

618
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,902
Now, let's--
Hey, wait a minute!

619
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,004
-Bring that over here.
-There it goes.

620
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:48,369
-No, whip it around the other way.
-You keep quiet.

621
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,635
-We know what we're doing.
-Okay.

622
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:53,302
Say, I thought I wasn't
gonna be able to walk again.

623
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,005
-I got it too.
-It's fine now.

624
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:58,083
Stuffy, I got it. Come on.

625
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,724
1 :44. That's bad.

626
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,526
You think that's bad?
I know something worse than that.

627
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,532
-Did Stuffy tell you?
-Tell me what?

628
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,796
-Hackenapuss, he's a horse doctor.
-What?

629
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:22,375
-Sure. Here, ask Stuffy.
-A horse doctor?

630
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:27,177
-Does anyone else know about this?
-Only Hackenapuss, and he won't talk.

631
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:29,145
It's bound to get out sooner or later.

632
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:32,149
There must be something
we can do to help Judy.

633
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:37,518
Yes. Hi Hat, you gotta win the race
and make us plenty of money.

634
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:41,327
Stuffy's right.
Hi Hat's too hungry to run.

635
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:44,931
I'm gonna get paid extra for singing
at the water carnival tonight.

636
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,000
That's fine. You sing,
I sell some more books...

637
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,262
...and Stuffy, he's gonna
put Hi Hat to bed.

638
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,406
I've gotta go to rehearsal.
See you later.

639
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,438
-All right. Good luck.
-Hey, you!

640
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:55,836
Hello, sheriff.

641
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,673
I told you not to take this horse out
till I got the rest of my dough.

642
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:02,179
We didn't take him out.
He walked out, we followed.

643
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:04,317
I warned you.
Now I'm taking the nag.

644
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:09,616
Hey, you can't take that horse. How will
we win money to pay the feed bill?

645
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,250
That don't mean a thing to me. I'm gonna
put him where nobody will take him out.

646
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,376
He couldn't get you,
so he took six other girls.

647
00:47:43,408 --> 00:47:45,603
Isn't it beautiful?

648
00:47:45,777 --> 00:47:48,439
It's the prettiest number
I've ever seen.

649
00:47:51,283 --> 00:47:54,946
Oh, Hugo, it's so impress--

650
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:57,579
Now what?

651
00:47:57,756 --> 00:48:00,520
The idea!

652
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,623
Oh, now, Judy, wait a minute.

653
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:06,286
I want to talk to you.
You can't depend on Hackenbush.

654
00:48:06,465 --> 00:48:10,492
Mrs. Upjohn is perfectly satisfied with
Dr. Hackenbush, and that's what matters.

655
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:13,194
In fact, she may take over
the notes tomorrow.

656
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:17,067
I guess everything's all right.
Nothing to worry about?

657
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:19,870
No, not a thing,
except that horse of yours.

658
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:22,309
Wait. That horse is all right.
He's in the pink.

659
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:25,473
Why, today he ran the mile in 1 :36.
That horse is going places.

660
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:28,586
Oh, that's wonderful.
I wish you luck.

661
00:48:28,754 --> 00:48:31,621
-Thanks. I'm sorry I bothered you.
-It's all right.

662
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:36,419
Now, Judy, I'm the biggest liar
in seven states.

663
00:48:36,595 --> 00:48:38,654
He isn't all right,
he isn't in the pink...

664
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,128
...and it was 1 :44 instead of 1 :36...

665
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,201
...and the only place he'll go
is where the sheriff takes him.

666
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:47,338
You can't possibly mean Hi Hat.

667
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:50,036
Well, there's only one horse
in my stable.

668
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:52,040
Come on, let me have the rest of it.

669
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:54,836
The only thing I'm going
to say is this, Gil:

670
00:48:55,013 --> 00:48:58,710
Don't ever let a horse
come between us again.

671
00:49:00,485 --> 00:49:01,850
She loves him.

672
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,352
Everything is going to be
all right now.

673
00:49:17,002 --> 00:49:19,402
Change your partners.

674
00:49:42,628 --> 00:49:46,792
-Hugo, I am surprised at you.
-Oh, you didn't know I could rumba?

675
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:55,570
Change your partners.

676
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:21,890
How would you like me
to dance away from you?

677
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:25,059
I'd be satisfied if you'd dance
off my feet.

678
00:51:03,775 --> 00:51:06,938
I'm disappointed. To think of your dancing
with that strange woman.

679
00:51:07,112 --> 00:51:10,343
Well, don't think of it.
Think of me dancing with you.

680
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:17,278
I'm crazy about you.

681
00:51:18,123 --> 00:51:20,990
Nothing will ever
come between us again.

682
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:24,385
You don't know
how lonely I get at night...

683
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:27,088
...in my little room at the sanitarium.

684
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:28,698
Room 41 2.

685
00:51:28,867 --> 00:51:32,132
Perhaps I could come in
and say good night to you.

686
00:51:32,304 --> 00:51:36,138
Yes. We could have a midnight snack,
nice little steak between us.

687
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,600
Why, Hugo!

688
00:51:38,777 --> 00:51:41,974
You'd stay up until midnight.
That's how you follow doctor's orders.

689
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:45,708
You know you're supposed to be in bed
by 1 0:00. 1 2:00. 1 0:00.

690
00:52:00,065 --> 00:52:02,465
Listen, we mustn't have
any disturbance here tonight.

691
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:06,469
All right. I can wait.

692
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,566
Well, it's in the bag. I have a date
with him in his room at 1 2.

693
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:55,008
Nice going. See that you stay there
till I break in with Mrs. Upjohn.

694
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,648
I want Hackenbush fired
out of the sanitarium tonight.

695
00:58:57,816 --> 00:58:59,943
Don't worry.
When you knock on the door...

696
00:59:00,118 --> 00:59:04,054
...I'll have that moth-eaten Romeo
playing the balcony scene.

697
00:59:18,503 --> 00:59:21,199
I got you. I got you. I--

698
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,806
You're spoiling my game.
What's the matter?

699
00:59:23,975 --> 00:59:25,670
What's the matter?

700
00:59:25,844 --> 00:59:27,778
Buffalo Bill?

701
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:31,409
Buffalo Bill goes ice-skating?

702
00:59:37,055 --> 00:59:38,317
Oh, Hackenbush!

703
00:59:38,656 --> 00:59:41,147
Oh, what's the matter with him?

704
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:43,317
Dr. Hackenbush.

705
00:59:43,494 --> 00:59:45,553
He's got a snake?

706
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:48,129
No.

707
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:50,460
He's got apple dumpling?

708
00:59:51,169 --> 00:59:52,602
Dr. Hackenbush...

709
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,897
...he's got apple dumpling.

710
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:56,805
No apple dumpling.

711
00:59:56,975 --> 00:59:59,170
No, it's no apple dumpling. No.

712
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:00,572
No.

713
01:00:00,745 --> 01:00:03,714
Oh, it's a woman! A woman.
Oh, I get it.

714
01:00:03,882 --> 01:00:07,147
Oh, there's a woman.
Yeah. Smart, eh?

715
01:00:07,986 --> 01:00:09,954
Dr. Hackenbush...

716
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:12,055
...there's a woman...

717
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:14,587
...she got a wooden leg?

718
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:15,987
No?

719
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,060
She got a woodpecker?

720
01:00:18,229 --> 01:00:20,026
She got a headache?

721
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:23,199
Dr. Hackenbush...

722
01:00:23,368 --> 01:00:24,858
...there's a woman...

723
01:00:25,036 --> 01:00:27,027
...she knock on the door!

724
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:29,196
She knock on the door!
All right. All right.

725
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:33,708
Dr. Hackenbush, there's a woman,
she knock on the door....

726
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:42,342
You're crazy!
You make me sick.

727
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,249
What's the matter now?

728
01:00:46,524 --> 01:00:48,151
Oh, she's going to frame him!

729
01:00:48,326 --> 01:00:51,659
Oh, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.

730
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:23,824
-Who is it?
-It's Miss Marlowe.

731
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:26,190
Just a moment, fruitcake.

732
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:47,647
Yes?

733
01:01:47,919 --> 01:01:49,750
Oh, doctor.

734
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:52,253
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

735
01:01:52,824 --> 01:01:54,815
-Do you like gardenias?
-I adore them.

736
01:01:54,993 --> 01:01:57,655
-How did you know?
-I didn't, so I got you forget-me-nots.

737
01:01:58,963 --> 01:02:01,625
One whiff of this,
and you'll forget everything.

738
01:02:02,934 --> 01:02:04,458
Won't you sit down?

739
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:11,570
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

740
01:02:11,743 --> 01:02:13,267
Oh, do you mind?

741
01:02:13,444 --> 01:02:16,174
Not at all. I always take the wrap.

742
01:02:17,048 --> 01:02:19,346
You are such a charming host.

743
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,348
The Hackenbushes, we're all like that.

744
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:23,680
-How about a short beer?
-Nothing, thank you.

745
01:02:23,855 --> 01:02:25,482
Thank you.

746
01:02:27,592 --> 01:02:31,653
Miss Marlowe, I've dreamed
of this moment ever since I met you.

747
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:34,093
For days, I've been trying to see you...

748
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,790
...and I still don't seem
to be able to make the grade.

749
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:40,768
A quiet evening alone with you.
What more could anyone ask?

750
01:02:41,272 --> 01:02:43,297
Say, did you sneak out of here?

751
01:02:43,474 --> 01:02:45,601
Oh, there you are.

752
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:49,373
Isn't this too, too devastating?

753
01:02:49,947 --> 01:02:52,347
You mind carving?
I can't reach the steak from here.

754
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:54,144
Me?

755
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:55,945
Yes?

756
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,982
Hey, doc. Hey, doc, can you see us?

757
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:01,782
If I can't, there's something wrong
with my glasses.

758
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:04,725
You mean, her? She's the one?

759
01:03:04,896 --> 01:03:06,124
We fix her.

760
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:11,090
Oh, baby, you look good to me!

761
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:12,497
Oh, stop it!

762
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:15,537
Wait a minute.
I thought you came here to see me.

763
01:03:15,706 --> 01:03:18,004
Well, I can see you from here.

764
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:19,871
Get up, you--

765
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:21,443
You know my friend.

766
01:03:27,518 --> 01:03:29,679
Oh, no. Not for me,
three men on a horse.

767
01:03:30,221 --> 01:03:32,883
What is the meaning of this?

768
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:34,649
Why, you little pest.

769
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:37,761
What's the matter with you mugs?
Haven't you got any gallantry?

770
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:40,124
She's with Whitmore.
She's trying to frame you.

771
01:03:40,298 --> 01:03:43,131
Wouldn't mind framing her.
A prettier picture I've never seen.

772
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:44,529
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

773
01:03:44,702 --> 01:03:47,899
Hey, doc. Doc, I'm telling you a secret!
She's out to get you!

774
01:03:48,072 --> 01:03:50,506
Why, I've never been so insulted
in my life.

775
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:52,870
Well, it's early yet.

776
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:55,842
I'm leaving. I'm not going to stay here
with these men.

777
01:03:56,013 --> 01:03:59,039
You're not leaving. They're leaving.
I want you fellas to get out.

778
01:03:59,217 --> 01:04:01,651
-Oh, my cape!
-Come back here with my woman.

779
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:04,877
You fellas are busting up
a beautiful romance.

780
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:06,921
Get her out.
She's going to make trouble.

781
01:04:07,091 --> 01:04:10,686
You're wrong. This is my aunt. She's
come to talk over some family matters.

782
01:04:10,862 --> 01:04:12,557
I wish I had an aunt look like that.

783
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,527
Well, take it up with your uncle.

784
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:17,224
Hey, doc. Doc, you're playing with fire.

785
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:20,165
-You didn't mind getting scorched.
-I got fire insurance.

786
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:21,828
Well, you better get accident.

787
01:04:22,006 --> 01:04:24,236
Scram. Blow.

788
01:04:30,515 --> 01:04:33,848
How do you like those cheap chiselers
horning in on us?

789
01:04:37,155 --> 01:04:38,884
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

790
01:04:45,196 --> 01:04:47,790
-How about a little Scotch?
-Why, I'd love it.

791
01:04:47,965 --> 01:04:49,865
Oh, I'll ring for some.

792
01:04:50,034 --> 01:04:52,969
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

793
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:57,732
Will you have the bellhop
hop up with some hop Scotch?

794
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:00,639
I'll flip you to see who pays for it.

795
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:03,405
Oh, doctor.

796
01:05:11,222 --> 01:05:12,814
I'm O'Reilly, the house detective.

797
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,720
Don't talk so loud.
Your mustache will drop off.

798
01:05:16,294 --> 01:05:17,693
Have you got a woman in here?

799
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:20,422
If I haven't, I've wasted 30 minutes
of valuable time.

800
01:05:20,598 --> 01:05:23,567
You better get her out.
This is the last time I'll tell you.

801
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:25,429
The last time? Can I depend on that?

802
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:29,039
Yes, because this time,
I'm going to stay all night.

803
01:05:34,779 --> 01:05:37,304
-This looks like a tough case.
-So does this.

804
01:05:37,548 --> 01:05:40,278
I think I'll call me assistant.

805
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:57,058
If you're looking for my fingerprints,
you're a little early.

806
01:06:08,212 --> 01:06:10,578
When you're through
with that steak, chew him.

807
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,953
Pull in your ears.
You're coming to a tunnel.

808
01:06:18,756 --> 01:06:22,852
Get along, little doggies.
Get along, little doggies.

809
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:25,294
It's been a nice, quiet dinner.

810
01:06:25,463 --> 01:06:28,523
How do you know?
You haven't had any yet. Shall we?

811
01:06:31,736 --> 01:06:33,601
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

812
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:39,004
Tomato soup?

813
01:06:44,148 --> 01:06:45,809
Have you got a can opener?

814
01:06:45,983 --> 01:06:47,814
Oh, here it is.

815
01:06:49,186 --> 01:06:50,881
Oh, I'm really not hungry.

816
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:52,647
Couldn't we just sit over here?

817
01:06:52,823 --> 01:06:56,259
I want to be near you.
I want you to hold me.

818
01:06:56,427 --> 01:06:58,486
Oh, hold me closer.

819
01:06:58,663 --> 01:07:01,723
Closer. Closer.

820
01:07:01,899 --> 01:07:04,629
If I hold you any closer,
I'll be in back of you.

821
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:07,994
You're so comforting.

822
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:09,935
The Hackenbushes, we're all like that.

823
01:07:10,107 --> 01:07:12,541
Shall we sit down and bat it around?

824
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:24,045
You're a little near-seated--
A little nearsighted, aren't you?

825
01:07:25,756 --> 01:07:29,886
Oh, no. There's nobody else going
to get in. I bolted the door.

826
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:36,323
Say, fun is fun.

827
01:07:40,037 --> 01:07:42,130
We come to hang the paper.

828
01:07:42,306 --> 01:07:44,866
How about hanging yourself instead?

829
01:07:47,445 --> 01:07:50,744
-Well, I'm going to stay right here.
-Thank you.

830
01:07:50,915 --> 01:07:55,614
That's right, Stuffy. You work that side, l
work this side, and we meet on the ceiling.

831
01:07:55,786 --> 01:07:58,619
You'll wind up on the gallows
is my prediction.

832
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:03,783
I must be a citizen.
I just got my second papers.

833
01:08:08,632 --> 01:08:11,726
Looks like a wet track tomorrow, Stuffy.

834
01:08:13,804 --> 01:08:18,298
-I think Stuffy's is the one with water.
-I'll see that he's dismissed immediately.

835
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:23,606
What's going on?

836
01:08:24,782 --> 01:08:27,307
Good gracious!

837
01:08:29,019 --> 01:08:32,147
You're mistaken. There's no woman here.

838
01:08:32,323 --> 01:08:34,484
-What are they--?
-No?

839
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:40,020
Hugo!

840
01:08:40,197 --> 01:08:41,562
What are you doing?

841
01:08:41,732 --> 01:08:44,860
I'm having the place done over.
It'll make a lovely honeymoon suite.

842
01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:49,563
-Good--
-You better go, dear.

843
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,140
-We're tearing up the floor next.
-Oh, my.

844
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:55,335
Come, Mr. Whitmore.
I've a few words to say to you.

845
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:02,783
Boys, you were wonderful.
You saved my life.

846
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:08,919
I'll get even. You-- You dirty, low-down,
cheap, double-crossing snake.

847
01:09:09,093 --> 01:09:10,788
Thank you.

848
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:21,960
Hugo, speak to me.

849
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:25,475
I said I was sorry about last night.

850
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:28,874
I never should have mistrusted you.

851
01:09:29,547 --> 01:09:33,074
Isn't there anything I can do
to make you forgive me?

852
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:36,117
You could take over the notes
from Miss Standish.

853
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,315
Then would you forgive me?

854
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:40,423
Well, it would help.

855
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,523
Emily, I can't hide it any longer.
I love you.

856
01:09:44,695 --> 01:09:46,424
Oh, Hugo.

857
01:09:46,597 --> 01:09:49,361
It's the old, old story, boy meets girl.

858
01:09:49,533 --> 01:09:51,262
Romeo and Juliet.

859
01:09:51,435 --> 01:09:53,232
Minneapolis and St. Paul.

860
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:55,300
Mrs. Upjohn.

861
01:09:55,806 --> 01:09:57,774
Judy has the papers ready
for you to sign.

862
01:09:57,942 --> 01:09:59,910
Later, later. Can't you see we're busy?

863
01:10:00,077 --> 01:10:02,204
It's all right.
I'll remember where I left off.

864
01:10:02,379 --> 01:10:05,212
Must they do that now?

865
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,778
Mrs. Upjohn, just a moment, please.

866
01:10:07,952 --> 01:10:11,251
Mrs. Upjohn, may I present
Dr. Leopold X. Steinberg of Vienna?

867
01:10:11,422 --> 01:10:14,585
And this is Dr. Hackenbush.

868
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:18,319
Doctor. I have a few questions
I would like to ask you.

869
01:10:18,496 --> 01:10:20,430
I've got a question I'd like to ask you.

870
01:10:20,598 --> 01:10:23,999
Steinberg, what do you do
with your old razorblades?

871
01:10:24,535 --> 01:10:27,470
I've been telling Dr. Steinberg
about your unusual case.

872
01:10:27,638 --> 01:10:32,541
Yes, and I would like to know
what is this ailment, double blood pressure?

873
01:10:34,044 --> 01:10:36,945
Dr. Hackenbush tells me
I'm the only case in history.

874
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:42,848
I have high blood pressure on my right
side and low blood pressure on my left side.

875
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,885
There is no such thing.

876
01:10:45,055 --> 01:10:47,046
She looks as healthy
as any woman I've met.

877
01:10:47,424 --> 01:10:49,654
You don't look like
you ever met a healthy woman.

878
01:10:49,827 --> 01:10:51,886
-What?
-Gentlemen, gentlemen.

879
01:10:52,062 --> 01:10:55,759
There's a very simple way to settle this.
Why not examine Mrs. Upjohn?

880
01:10:55,933 --> 01:10:58,265
-Splendid, splendid.
-Right this way, Mrs. Upjohn.

881
01:10:58,435 --> 01:11:02,337
Dr. Hackenbush will show you,
then I insist that you apologize to him.

882
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:06,033
Come, Hugo. The idea!

883
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:12,309
Hey, doc, where you going?
If Steinberg examines her, we're through.

884
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:14,110
-I'm through right now.
-You're not.

885
01:11:14,285 --> 01:11:17,277
You gotta get in there.
Do anything, but stop Steinberg. Hurry.

886
01:11:17,454 --> 01:11:20,719
I'll say. I'm hopping the next
banana boat for Central America.

887
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:22,756
Hey, doc, where you going?

888
01:11:23,227 --> 01:11:25,252
Wait, doc. Wait.

889
01:11:28,098 --> 01:11:31,659
It's all right with me. Go right ahead.
I'm not sleeping here tonight.

890
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:36,902
-It's Hi Hat.
-Nonsense. That's a horse.

891
01:11:37,074 --> 01:11:40,874
No, it's Hi Hat. We hide him in the closet
so the sheriff can't find him.

892
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:43,172
Is that so?
He's not going to find me either...

893
01:11:43,347 --> 01:11:45,474
...because I'm leaving here
right away, boys.

894
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:47,310
Doc, doc, wait a minute, now.

895
01:11:47,484 --> 01:11:50,009
-No, I'll see you again sometime.
-No, doc, please.

896
01:11:50,187 --> 01:11:52,883
See you again, just as soon
as I get my effects.

897
01:11:53,057 --> 01:11:56,356
Old Hackenbush isn't gonna be
with you very long.

898
01:11:56,527 --> 01:12:00,987
-Doc, you can't walk out on us like this.
-I'll say I can't. I'm gonna run out.

899
01:12:02,299 --> 01:12:05,029
You can't go, doc.
If you walk out, where will Judy be?

900
01:12:05,202 --> 01:12:08,035
She won't be in jail,
and that's where I'll be if I stay here.

901
01:12:08,205 --> 01:12:09,433
Besides, what can I do?

902
01:12:09,607 --> 01:12:13,168
-You've got to stop the examination.
-Not today I don't.

903
01:12:13,344 --> 01:12:15,039
Are you a man or a mouse?

904
01:12:15,212 --> 01:12:18,306
You put a piece of cheese down there,
and you'll find out.

905
01:12:19,249 --> 01:12:21,945
Well, it's been nice seeing you.

906
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:25,049
Oh, no, you don't.
You leave, it's over my dead body.

907
01:12:25,222 --> 01:12:26,985
Well, that's a pleasant way to travel.

908
01:12:27,157 --> 01:12:30,752
All right. Now, look, doc.
You can't leave Miss Judy in a fix like this.

909
01:12:30,928 --> 01:12:32,862
-I know, but the sheriff--
-Doc, doc.

910
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:36,864
If you leave now,
Judy loses the sanitarium.

911
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:38,429
All right. I'll stay.

912
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:41,093
You're gonna stay?
I knew you'd do it, doc.

913
01:12:42,172 --> 01:12:43,901
Next, we will see--

914
01:12:44,074 --> 01:12:45,871
Just a moment. Take your hands off her!

915
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:47,601
A fine doctor you are.

916
01:12:47,778 --> 01:12:50,804
You're not supposed to touch a patient
without being sterilized.

917
01:12:50,981 --> 01:12:53,245
You don't see me running
an examination like that.

918
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:55,317
No, that's true.

919
01:12:55,486 --> 01:12:57,477
And I think it would be very interesting...

920
01:12:57,655 --> 01:13:00,749
...to see just how Dr. Hackenbush
does conduct an examination.

921
01:13:00,924 --> 01:13:04,121
Splendid, splendid. Show them, doctor.

922
01:13:04,294 --> 01:13:06,387
If you insist, I'll proceed.

923
01:13:16,173 --> 01:13:19,631
In case you've never done it,
this is known as washing your hands.

924
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:35,456
I'd rather have it rusty than missing.

925
01:13:39,763 --> 01:13:42,891
You'll go a long ways to see
prettier drippings than those.

926
01:13:43,067 --> 01:13:46,798
Why sterilization? After all,
this is not an operation, you know?

927
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:52,067
Not yet, but I may get hot and operate
on everybody in the joint, including you.

928
01:13:53,177 --> 01:13:55,270
Come, come, doctor. Aren't you ready?

929
01:13:55,779 --> 01:13:58,407
Now, Mrs. Upjohn,
I guess I know my business.

930
01:13:58,582 --> 01:14:00,573
Of course, that's just a guess
on my part...

931
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:03,686
...but at any rate, I know a thing
or two about cleanliness...

932
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:07,381
...and that's more than I can say
for that mountain goat standing there.

933
01:14:10,427 --> 01:14:12,918
Come, doctor. We're waiting.

934
01:14:13,097 --> 01:14:15,725
All right. If you insist,
we'll proceed at once.

935
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:18,800
Now, Mrs. Upjohn,
I want you to take your arms...

936
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:22,336
...and let them wave through the air
with the greatest of ease.

937
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:25,470
Not too swiftly.

938
01:14:25,642 --> 01:14:28,736
-Like that, doctor?
-Yes, that's splendid.

939
01:14:28,912 --> 01:14:31,107
How long do you want me
to do this, doctor?

940
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:33,806
Just until you fly away.

941
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:42,483
I told you guys to stay down
in that room with those pigeons.

942
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:57,131
Dr. Hackenbush, tell me,
who sent for these men?

943
01:14:57,307 --> 01:15:00,504
You don't have to send for them.
You just rub a lamp, and they appear.

944
01:15:00,677 --> 01:15:03,009
-My name is Steinberg.
-Nix. Nix. That's Steinberg.

945
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:06,877
Dr. Steinberg, by a strange coincidence,
this is another Dr. Steinberg.

946
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:10,781
May I introduce my colleagues
and good friends, another Dr. Steinberg?

947
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:12,979
This is a Dr. Steinberg, Dr. Steinberg.

948
01:15:13,157 --> 01:15:15,421
Dr. Steinberg and Mrs. Steinberg.

949
01:15:15,592 --> 01:15:18,857
And, doctor, I'd like you
to meet another Dr. Steinberg.

950
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:21,096
And that's Steinberg Jr.

951
01:15:21,431 --> 01:15:25,527
If Dr. Hackenbush is not going to continue
with the examination, professor...

952
01:15:25,702 --> 01:15:29,194
-...may we have your diagnosis, please?
-With pleasure.

953
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:30,965
In all my years of medicine--

954
01:15:31,141 --> 01:15:34,508
In your years of medicine. You don't
know the first thing about medicine.

955
01:15:34,978 --> 01:15:37,242
And don't point that beard at me.
It might go off.

956
01:15:37,414 --> 01:15:41,908
Dr. Steinberg, do you remember
your diagnosis?

957
01:15:42,085 --> 01:15:45,543
Certainly. To begin with,
her pulse is absolutely normal.

958
01:15:45,722 --> 01:15:47,553
-I challenge that.
-Challenge that?

959
01:15:47,724 --> 01:15:49,487
-You take her pulse.
-Pulse?

960
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,924
-Take her pulse!
-I don't do any pulse work.

961
01:15:52,095 --> 01:15:54,188
I am an acute diagnostician.

962
01:15:54,364 --> 01:15:56,730
Take her pulse. Take her pulse!

963
01:15:57,401 --> 01:16:00,495
Oh, no, no, no. My purse, my purse,
my purse. He has my purse!

964
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:03,037
You must forgive him.
He doesn't spell very well.

965
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:05,869
Oh, dear. Come, gentlemen.
Let us begin.

966
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:10,480
You shouldn't have done that. Now we're
all unsterilized. What's the matter with you?

967
01:16:19,456 --> 01:16:22,050
Well, I must say,
I've seen quicker examinations.

968
01:16:22,226 --> 01:16:24,251
Maybe, but you'll never see
a slipperier one.

969
01:16:24,428 --> 01:16:27,056
-Are you ready to proceed?
-We'll proceed immediately.

970
01:16:27,231 --> 01:16:30,530
Doctor. And what do you expect
to do next?

971
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:33,431
The next thing I think we should do
is wash our hands.

972
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:35,799
-You're absolutely right.
-Oh, I've never seen--

973
01:16:41,278 --> 01:16:44,475
-Oh, what is the matter with them?
-I don't know.

974
01:16:44,648 --> 01:16:47,481
-What is this? Get away!
-Everything is going to be all right.

975
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:50,449
Nurse, sterilization! Sterilization!

976
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:53,351
-Are they mad? What is it?
-No, we're not mad.

977
01:16:53,523 --> 01:16:56,014
We're just terribly hurt, that's all.

978
01:16:56,927 --> 01:17:00,454
Hey, just a moment. Just put
the gown on, not the nurse, huh?

979
01:17:00,631 --> 01:17:02,155
Come here.

980
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:06,701
-How is it a dame like that never gets sick?
-But I am sick.

981
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,861
Doctor, will you pay attention to me?

982
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:11,872
You'll have to get in line.
There's three orders ahead of you.

983
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:15,307
That poor girl may be out there,
catching her death of cold.

984
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:17,947
-Same nurse, sterilization.
-Doc, get away from there.

985
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:21,107
-This is absolutely insane!
-That's what they said about Pasteur.

986
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:24,482
This is ridiculous.
Put the patient in a horizontal position.

987
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:28,151
-Oh, what are you gonna do now?
-Be careful. Be careful.

988
01:17:28,325 --> 01:17:31,055
I don't want to be examined anymore.
Do you hear me?

989
01:17:34,164 --> 01:17:35,392
Doctor, where are you?

990
01:17:35,565 --> 01:17:38,398
Oh, my. I want to get down.
You let me down this very moment.

991
01:17:38,568 --> 01:17:39,796
Do you hear me?

992
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:42,005
I'll get you down.

993
01:17:42,172 --> 01:17:44,697
I'll report this to Miss Standish.
You wait and see.

994
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:48,504
What are you doing?
Get off there. Get off there!

995
01:17:51,982 --> 01:17:54,007
How do you like that, honey?

996
01:17:54,618 --> 01:17:56,984
What are you doing? Give me that.

997
01:17:57,154 --> 01:18:00,783
Get away from me. I don't want
to have my head massaged!

998
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:05,019
In all my life, I haven't seen
such an examination!

999
01:18:05,696 --> 01:18:08,130
But there is one indisputable test.

1000
01:18:08,298 --> 01:18:09,526
-What?
-The x-ray!

1001
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,396
-X-ray!
-X-ray!

1002
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:16,369
X-ray! All about the examination!

1003
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:20,032
X-ray! All about the examination!

1004
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:22,872
X-ray! X-ray!

1005
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:24,980
X-ray!

1006
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:27,883
That's enough! I will call the police!

1007
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:32,782
I've never gone through
anything like this!

1008
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,378
-Well, I certainly messed things up for Judy.
-You messed things up?

1009
01:19:07,557 --> 01:19:10,754
I suppose old Doc Hackenbush
didn't throw a nasty monkey wrench.

1010
01:19:10,927 --> 01:19:12,895
You no throw the monkey wrench.

1011
01:19:13,063 --> 01:19:14,394
I'm the guy that did it.

1012
01:19:14,564 --> 01:19:17,556
Now, listen.
It was nobody's fault but mine.

1013
01:19:18,035 --> 01:19:20,799
I don't want any more arguments.
It was all my fault.

1014
01:19:20,971 --> 01:19:22,939
I think he's right. It was his fault.

1015
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:25,631
Oh, it was my fault, eh?
That's the thanks I get.

1016
01:19:25,809 --> 01:19:29,973
I get you the first shower you had in years,
you turn on me like a snake in the grass.

1017
01:19:30,147 --> 01:19:32,843
-Someone's coming.
-The sheriff.

1018
01:19:41,058 --> 01:19:44,494
-Judy.
-Hello, Miss Judy.

1019
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:47,459
-Hello. Hello.
-You're the prettiest sheriff I've ever seen.

1020
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:49,758
-Thought I was the sheriff?
-Taking no chances.

1021
01:19:49,933 --> 01:19:51,525
I just brought you these blankets.

1022
01:19:51,701 --> 01:19:55,102
I thought it might make it
a little more comfortable living out here.

1023
01:19:55,272 --> 01:19:56,500
Get up. Get up.

1024
01:19:56,673 --> 01:19:59,335
Don't worry about our comfort.
We bungled your affairs.

1025
01:19:59,509 --> 01:20:00,771
You did your best, Gil.

1026
01:20:00,944 --> 01:20:02,878
Yes, and our best was none too good.

1027
01:20:03,046 --> 01:20:06,072
Tell me, is the water still running
in the examination room?

1028
01:20:06,249 --> 01:20:09,150
After tomorrow,
I'm afraid that's Mr. Morgan's worry.

1029
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:11,344
Morgan, he no got the sanitarium yet.

1030
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:14,149
A lot of things can happen
before tomorrow.

1031
01:20:14,324 --> 01:20:16,724
The sanitarium doesn't matter anymore.

1032
01:20:16,893 --> 01:20:20,158
Gil, you were right.
I've been taking things far too seriously.

1033
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:23,595
It's much better this way.
Now I can be free. I won't be tied down.

1034
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:27,567
I can enjoy myself and really laugh.

1035
01:20:27,737 --> 01:20:28,965
Oh, Judy, please.

1036
01:20:29,139 --> 01:20:32,631
Don't cry, Miss Judy.
I feel sad, but I laugh.

1037
01:20:32,809 --> 01:20:34,970
I laugh. Stuffy's laughing too. Look.

1038
01:20:35,145 --> 01:20:36,840
Go on and laugh, Stuffy.

1039
01:20:37,414 --> 01:20:41,111
Hey, look. Look at Hackenapuss.
Laugh. Go on, laugh.

1040
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:43,885
Where did that come from?

1041
01:20:48,992 --> 01:20:51,552
It can't be that bad, Judy.

1042
01:20:55,298 --> 01:20:58,426
Look at those kids. Laughing, happy.

1043
01:20:58,602 --> 01:21:02,834
Come on. You're just a kid.
Laugh. Be happy.

1044
01:31:19,422 --> 01:31:21,322
It's the sheriff.

1045
01:31:24,894 --> 01:31:27,328
-Hey, you.
-I ain't done nothing.

1046
01:31:27,497 --> 01:31:29,658
You've got nothing on me.
My skirts are clean.

1047
01:31:29,832 --> 01:31:32,665
Yeah? This letter from Florida
says you're a horse doctor.

1048
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,794
Put them all under arrest.

1049
01:31:35,972 --> 01:31:38,600
They won't run, sheriff,
if you break their legs.

1050
01:31:40,109 --> 01:31:41,667
Get that horse. Get that horse.

1051
01:31:43,713 --> 01:31:45,044
What's wrong with that horse?

1052
01:31:45,214 --> 01:31:48,149
He goes wild every time
he sees Morgan or hears his voice.

1053
01:31:48,317 --> 01:31:50,342
Get him out.

1054
01:31:51,354 --> 01:31:55,222
Hey, come here, you.
Where do you think you're going?

1055
01:32:06,369 --> 01:32:07,859
You can't get away with this.

1056
01:32:12,475 --> 01:32:14,204
Never mind him. Get the horse.

1057
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:20,810
Why, you!

1058
01:32:21,784 --> 01:32:24,082
Nice work, Stuffy.

1059
01:32:24,921 --> 01:32:27,913
Stop that horse!
Don't let him get out of here!

1060
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,819
Did you see that horse jump?

1061
01:32:29,992 --> 01:32:32,927
And I'm doing some
pretty fancy jumping myself.

1062
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:36,391
Let me off this rope!

1063
01:32:36,566 --> 01:32:39,399
I'll throw you all in jail!
Get me down! Get me out of here!

1064
01:32:39,569 --> 01:32:42,595
This is no way to treat the law.
You'll never get away with this!

1065
01:32:42,772 --> 01:32:44,501
I'll get you.

1066
01:32:47,176 --> 01:32:48,404
There he goes.

1067
01:32:51,314 --> 01:32:54,181
If he's headed south,
I'd like to make a reservation.

1068
01:32:54,383 --> 01:32:56,544
Look at that horse.
He cleared the automobile.

1069
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:57,947
I wish I could clear mine.

1070
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:01,886
Darling, perhaps that's why he
never won a race. He's a jumper.

1071
01:33:02,058 --> 01:33:05,755
Am I a sap. I have a steeplechase horse,
and I don't know it.

1072
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,267
We're gonna find that added starter
and see that he doesn't start.

1073
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,364
They're not pulling any fast ones.
Hi Hat's not running.

1074
01:33:50,539 --> 01:33:53,804
-But Hi Hat isn't a jumper.
-He was doing plenty of jumping last night.

1075
01:33:53,976 --> 01:33:56,945
-But he can't beat your horse.
-Well, I'm not taking any chances.

1076
01:33:57,113 --> 01:33:59,581
My money is riding on Skee Ball,
and that's not all.

1077
01:33:59,749 --> 01:34:03,116
If Hi Hat wins,
we can kiss the sanitarium goodbye.

1078
01:34:03,286 --> 01:34:06,653
Well, Morgan, you got nothing
to worry about. Hi Hat's not on this track.

1079
01:34:06,822 --> 01:34:08,983
See he doesn't get on.
Put a man at every gate.

1080
01:34:09,158 --> 01:34:11,956
If that nag slips by you,
it means your job.

1081
01:34:26,108 --> 01:34:29,202
Here. Keep me posted.

1082
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:39,053
He's made it!
He's made it!

1083
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:41,382
Go ahead, Stuffy!
Go to it. Good luck!

1084
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:44,048
Ride them, cowboy,
or we're heading for the lockup.

1085
01:34:44,226 --> 01:34:45,750
Come on. We get a reserved seat.

1086
01:34:52,501 --> 01:34:54,526
-Gil!
-I got a man on every gate.

1087
01:34:54,704 --> 01:34:58,196
-There's no sign of them.
-See there's no sign of them till after.

1088
01:34:58,374 --> 01:35:01,104
Whoa, Hi Hat!
Whoa, boy! Hi Hat, whoa!

1089
01:35:03,145 --> 01:35:04,373
Hey, what you got in there?

1090
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:09,483
If you believe in signs, Sherlock,
look at that ambulance.

1091
01:35:12,555 --> 01:35:15,581
-Now, wait a minute, sheriff!
-Don't you start anything, Stewart!

1092
01:35:18,661 --> 01:35:21,858
We'll just put this baby
under lock and key.

1093
01:35:23,432 --> 01:35:26,333
You keep searching for those other mugs.

1094
01:35:32,975 --> 01:35:34,465
Stuffy.

1095
01:35:34,643 --> 01:35:36,577
What's the matter?

1096
01:35:37,446 --> 01:35:39,073
What's happened?

1097
01:35:39,248 --> 01:35:40,738
What?

1098
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:45,280
Hi Hat's gone!

1099
01:35:46,422 --> 01:35:50,722
-The race is going to start!
-They won't start till we find Hi Hat.

1100
01:35:56,465 --> 01:35:59,332
Now, listen, son,
you're riding this race to win.

1101
01:35:59,502 --> 01:36:02,835
I don't care what you do as long
as the judges don't see you doing it.

1102
01:36:03,005 --> 01:36:06,304
All right, men!
Go to your horses!

1103
01:36:15,451 --> 01:36:16,941
Soap!

1104
01:36:26,128 --> 01:36:30,155
We are sorry for the delay,
but the horses are now coming on the track.

1105
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,131
Twenty-five minutes late!

1106
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:34,326
The horses are parading
past the grandstand.

1107
01:36:34,503 --> 01:36:36,027
Only 1 1 are headed postward.

1108
01:36:36,205 --> 01:36:38,799
Hi Hat, the added starter, is missing.

1109
01:36:38,974 --> 01:36:41,135
This is the third running....

1110
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:56,620
Hey, Stuffy! Stuffy!
Did you find him?

1111
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:58,089
Did you find the ambulance?

1112
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,228
Well, keep on looking.
We know it came in.

1113
01:37:00,396 --> 01:37:02,887
Now that the storm of hats
has subsided...

1114
01:37:03,065 --> 01:37:06,296
...the stewards have ordered
the track cleared for action.

1115
01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:09,302
-Don't stop searching till you find them!
-Here you are, boss.

1116
01:37:09,472 --> 01:37:13,238
--and the horses are back on parade
towards the starting point.

1117
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:16,503
They're going back now,
up to the starting post.

1118
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:20,547
And everyone is getting his own hat,
we hope.

1119
01:37:21,217 --> 01:37:24,482
The horses are coming back
to the starter now. They're very fractious.

1120
01:37:24,653 --> 01:37:26,848
They are giving the boys
quite a bit of trouble.

1121
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:31,419
First Legion is acting very badly....

1122
01:37:31,594 --> 01:37:34,495
Free parking! Here you are!
Free parking!

1123
01:37:35,131 --> 01:37:37,691
Get your free parking!
Come on! Come on, this way!

1124
01:37:37,867 --> 01:37:40,427
They're coming up this time,
almost in an even line.

1125
01:37:40,603 --> 01:37:43,037
The starter has his flag up,
and it looks like--

1126
01:37:43,205 --> 01:37:44,467
Wait a minute!
What is this?

1127
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,200
A horserace or an automobile race?

1128
01:37:48,677 --> 01:37:50,304
Hold those horses!

1129
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:52,071
Hold it! Hold it!

1130
01:37:58,354 --> 01:38:01,221
Plenty of room. Nice fresh parking today.
Right ahead, folks.

1131
01:38:19,074 --> 01:38:21,736
You girls got anything on for tonight?

1132
01:38:22,811 --> 01:38:24,904
Hey! Hey!

1133
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:27,548
-Get that one!
-Hey, get off!

1134
01:39:03,152 --> 01:39:04,813
Going my way?

1135
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:10,190
Get them out!
Get them out of here!

1136
01:39:14,163 --> 01:39:15,994
Hey, Stuffy, did you find Hi Hat?

1137
01:39:16,165 --> 01:39:18,565
Well, keep looking.
He must be around somewheres.

1138
01:39:30,246 --> 01:39:33,704
Get that horse out of there!
There's been a terrible wreck!

1139
01:39:34,483 --> 01:39:36,883
Come on! Hurry up! Help me!

1140
01:39:54,103 --> 01:39:57,903
-Come on, we've got no time to lose.
-ls she alive?

1141
01:40:03,045 --> 01:40:06,276
-Get going, sheriff, I'll take care of her.
-All right.

1142
01:40:16,992 --> 01:40:19,187
-Well, here we are again.
-Come on!

1143
01:40:19,361 --> 01:40:22,330
Get them off
before something else happens.

1144
01:40:22,498 --> 01:40:25,763
-Turn that horse around.
-It looks like he's going to send them away.

1145
01:40:25,934 --> 01:40:27,902
- Yes, yes....
-Now, easy, easy.

1146
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:30,470
And now they go!

1147
01:40:33,876 --> 01:40:36,003
-At last.
-Flying Demon is third.

1148
01:40:36,178 --> 01:40:38,544
Sun Helmet is fourth, and Green Goddess.

1149
01:40:38,714 --> 01:40:41,274
Skee Ball showing the way
in the center of the track...

1150
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:44,442
...by two lengths.
Sun Helmet is second.

1151
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:47,646
Green Goddess is third,
and Flying Demon is fourth.

1152
01:40:48,257 --> 01:40:52,455
Now they're going around the first turn
with Skee Ball in front by two lengths.

1153
01:40:52,628 --> 01:40:54,528
First Legion is second by a head.

1154
01:40:54,697 --> 01:40:56,096
Wait a minute!
What is this?

1155
01:40:56,732 --> 01:40:57,926
What is--?
What happened?

1156
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,034
Get me the riot squad!

1157
01:41:01,403 --> 01:41:04,429
-Oh, Mr. Morgan, don't get excited.
-I'm not excited! Shut up!

1158
01:41:07,843 --> 01:41:09,470
Quiet, please. Your attention.

1159
01:41:10,612 --> 01:41:13,046
Quiet, please! Your attention!

1160
01:41:13,215 --> 01:41:14,580
Stuffy!

1161
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:18,311
The stewards have ruled this
a false start...

1162
01:41:18,921 --> 01:41:22,618
...and have ordered the horses back
to the starting post.

1163
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:25,688
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
if you will all....

1164
01:41:25,861 --> 01:41:27,419
Stuffy, scram!

1165
01:41:27,596 --> 01:41:30,690
Who knows, we may yet have
a horserace this afternoon.

1166
01:41:30,866 --> 01:41:34,302
Horses are back at the starting point.

1167
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:39,100
And now the boys are turning them about.
They're very nervous, very fractious.

1168
01:41:39,274 --> 01:41:41,071
They're having quite a bit of trouble.

1169
01:41:41,243 --> 01:41:42,801
Get that wagon off of here!

1170
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:05,793
Get off!

1171
01:42:06,435 --> 01:42:08,266
Get it off!

1172
01:42:10,973 --> 01:42:13,669
Hi Hat, he got him away from me!
I don't know where he is!

1173
01:42:13,842 --> 01:42:15,707
What do you think that is, stupid?

1174
01:42:17,746 --> 01:42:19,646
-Number 7!
-Somebody's gonna pay for this!

1175
01:42:19,815 --> 01:42:21,043
That's Hi Hat!

1176
01:42:21,884 --> 01:42:25,479
They're coming up to the start this time,
and the starter has his flag raised.

1177
01:42:25,654 --> 01:42:27,519
And now they go!

1178
01:42:28,424 --> 01:42:30,722
Here comes Hi Hat!

1179
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,622
And he's in the race!

1180
01:42:32,795 --> 01:42:34,228
Come on! Hoof it!

1181
01:42:34,396 --> 01:42:37,388
Skee Ball going to the front,
First Legion is second...

1182
01:42:37,566 --> 01:42:40,330
...Flying Demon is third,
Sun Helmet is fourth...

1183
01:42:40,502 --> 01:42:41,901
...and Green Goddess is fifth.

1184
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:43,935
Now there goes Hi Hat into contention.

1185
01:42:44,106 --> 01:42:46,700
He's picking up the field,
he's moving up between horses.

1186
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:49,673
And look at him go!
He's moving up there at the leader.

1187
01:42:49,845 --> 01:42:52,507
And Skee Ball's still in front,
pressing into second.

1188
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:56,310
But here comes Hi Hat between horses,
and now he's challenging the leader.

1189
01:42:58,287 --> 01:43:00,346
Skee Ball in front
by a length and one half.

1190
01:43:00,522 --> 01:43:02,854
Hi Hat is second by three-quarters
of a length.

1191
01:43:03,025 --> 01:43:05,255
First Legion is third
by a length and one half...

1192
01:43:05,427 --> 01:43:08,396
...and Flying Demon is fourth.
Now Skee Ball is going out a bit.

1193
01:43:08,564 --> 01:43:12,193
And they're coming to the first fence now,
and Skee Ball takes it...

1194
01:43:12,367 --> 01:43:14,733
...but Hi Hat refuses.
He 's turning back.

1195
01:43:14,903 --> 01:43:18,464
But wait a minute, wait a minute.
He 's going to try it. There he goes.

1196
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,870
He's going after it this time,
and he's over!

1197
01:43:21,043 --> 01:43:23,034
Oh, your idea worked, Judy!

1198
01:43:23,212 --> 01:43:26,613
Flying Demon is third by three-quarters
of a length. Sun Helmet in fourth.

1199
01:43:26,782 --> 01:43:29,148
Oh, he's lost Morgan's picture!

1200
01:43:30,018 --> 01:43:32,043
And he's going up on the outside
this time...

1201
01:43:32,221 --> 01:43:36,214
...and here he is at the leader! It's Skee Ball
in front. Here comes Skee Ball....

1202
01:43:36,391 --> 01:43:38,621
Can you shout like Morgan?

1203
01:43:38,794 --> 01:43:40,989
No, but Morgan can.

1204
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:44,592
--third by three-quarters of a length.
Skee Ball on the outside.

1205
01:43:44,766 --> 01:43:48,668
And Hi Hat on the rail,
with Flying Demon third--

1206
01:43:49,638 --> 01:43:51,572
Something's happened
to the loudspeaker.

1207
01:44:04,887 --> 01:44:07,117
-Let me take a look.
-Give me those glasses--

1208
01:44:07,289 --> 01:44:08,551
It's you! Officer!

1209
01:44:14,863 --> 01:44:17,331
You take care of Judy,
and I'll take care of Morgan.

1210
01:44:36,952 --> 01:44:39,477
I hope the judges didn't see that.

1211
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,785
Mind telling the radio audience
what a heel you are?

1212
01:44:47,963 --> 01:44:49,760
Come back later.
I've had enough of y--

1213
01:44:50,299 --> 01:44:53,700
If the police can 't handle you,
I'll handle you myself!

1214
01:44:54,536 --> 01:44:56,766
Keep that man away from me,
do you understand?

1215
01:45:02,678 --> 01:45:04,873
Get down there! And stay there!

1216
01:45:05,047 --> 01:45:07,015
And see that
I'm not disturbed again today!

1217
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,982
Get out of here!

1218
01:45:13,155 --> 01:45:14,554
Get out of here!

1219
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,878
Oh, we've got him!
He won't get away this time!

1220
01:45:45,988 --> 01:45:48,252
-They're both down!
-Stuffy's down!

1221
01:45:58,533 --> 01:46:00,091
Skee Ball's in the lead!

1222
01:46:15,283 --> 01:46:16,841
-Smell this.
-Oh, get away!

1223
01:46:17,019 --> 01:46:19,385
I don't wanna smell anything!
Get him out of here!

1224
01:46:19,554 --> 01:46:22,352
Come on! How many men
does it take to do this?

1225
01:46:22,524 --> 01:46:25,186
Come on, Skee Ball!
Come on, Skee Ball!

1226
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,123
Come on, boy!

1227
01:46:32,334 --> 01:46:36,395
Skee Ball wins! He wins at everything!
Let me out of here.

1228
01:46:39,941 --> 01:46:43,570
Okay, sheriff, what are your rates
for a cell with southern exposure?

1229
01:46:43,745 --> 01:46:46,976
Gil, Hi Hat couldn't have tried harder.

1230
01:46:47,149 --> 01:46:48,582
We were just unlucky.

1231
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:56,587
Great race, Skee Ball.
Great race, Skee Ball.

1232
01:46:59,795 --> 01:47:02,662
Get out of here!
Get him out of here!

1233
01:47:13,942 --> 01:47:16,638
-Why, it's number 7!
-Hi Hat's the winner.

1234
01:47:19,815 --> 01:47:23,478
-Hi Hat wins! Cancel that reservation.
-It's Hi Hat!

1235
01:47:23,652 --> 01:47:26,621
Gil, come on! Come on,
I want to put the wreath on the winner!

1236
01:47:26,788 --> 01:47:29,848
One more yell out of you,
and he'd have jumped over the grandstand.

1237
01:47:30,025 --> 01:47:31,822
-Stuffy!
-Stuffy, you were wonderful!

1238
01:47:31,993 --> 01:47:34,223
-Oh, boy!
-I haven't seen so much mudslinging...

1239
01:47:34,396 --> 01:47:36,591
...since the last election.

1240
01:47:40,469 --> 01:47:43,233
Come on, boy! Hi Hat!

1241
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,371
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

1242
01:47:48,410 --> 01:47:50,469
Hallelujah!

1243
01:48:23,712 --> 01:48:25,703
Emily, I have a little confession to make.

1244
01:48:25,881 --> 01:48:27,542
I really am a horse doctor.

1245
01:48:27,716 --> 01:48:30,742
But marry me,
and I'll never look at any other horse.

1246
01:49:14,329 --> 01:49:15,318
