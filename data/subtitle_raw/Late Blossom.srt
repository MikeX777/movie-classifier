00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,373
KIM Su-mi

5
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,570
You there.

6
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,074
Did you fall because of me?

7
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,272
No, right?

8
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,981
Are you hurt?

9
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,247
No.

10
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,852
I'm talking to you!

11
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,024
I asked you
if you were hurt!

12
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,159
Don't make me repeat myself!

13
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,953
- I'm fine
- Don't mumble!

14
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,132
Is he deaf?

15
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,565
Speak up!

16
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,765
I'm not hurt!
You can go!

17
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,968
You're really okay?

18
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,780
Don't blame me later on.

19
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,048
- You got it?
- Okay.

20
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,649
You got it?

21
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,748
Yes!

22
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,971
Goddamn motorcycle.
Piece of junk.

23
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,580
I shouldn't have stopped.

24
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,985
Damn it.
Now I have to drag it up.

25
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,350
Excuse me.

26
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,245
Excuse me!

27
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,851
What are you calling me for?

28
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,550
I'd like to buy some milk.

29
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,166
Is a dollar enough?

30
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,767
Look here.

31
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,964
Are you trying to
repay me or something?

32
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,072
I don't need your money.

33
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,768
Forget about it.

34
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:11,049
You don't have to yell at me.

35
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,045
I've seen you around
in the mornings.

36
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,958
Take it.
It's leftover anyway.

37
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,962
Why are you out
in this weather?

38
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,573
Those scraps aren't even
worth much.

39
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,070
You don't have a family
to support you?

40
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,774
No.

41
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,081
What?

42
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,848
- I said I don't.
- Sheesh.

43
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,156
What are you doing?

44
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,533
You want to break your hip?

45
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,764
The snow will freeze up soon.

46
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,372
Why is thing so heavy?

47
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,577
Grab the back!

48
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,570
Oh my!

49
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,066
Damn back.

50
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,614
Are you all right?

51
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,582
No, I'm not.

52
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,044
I almost threw out my back.

53
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,846
Take care.

54
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,248
Drive safe.

55
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,057
Just worry about yourself.

56
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:08,853
Oh my!

57
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,963
It's nothing.
I'm fine, so go on!

58
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,067
Sheesh.

59
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,966
Shucks,
that was embarrassing.

60
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:57,273
LATE BLOSSOM

61
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:10,053
Get rid of that
piece of junk, Gramps.

62
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,550
Did you just call me
a piece of junk?

63
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,360
Put your hearing aid on!

64
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,264
This old hearing aid is
dying out on me.

65
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,075
Deok-bae.

66
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,842
Is there someone
who takes these?

67
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,549
Of course.
This is worth money too.

68
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,993
Do you have to
give it to them?

69
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,052
What do you need it for?

70
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,957
Can you give it to
someone else or not?

71
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,866
Of course not.
It's a matter of loyalty.

72
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,672
Deok-bae.

73
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,475
Don't take your time
and just say it.

74
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,378
There's a new parlor
across the street.

75
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,078
What about it?

76
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:16,150
Wonder where you got the money
to spend there every night.

77
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,856
Gramps!

78
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,451
- Deok-bae.
- Yes? Yes, Father!

79
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,499
- Why are you so jumpy?
- I'm not jumpy.

80
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,251
Watch the store.

81
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:29,968
Going somewhere?

82
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,162
Have a nice day.

83
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,070
I'll watch the store!

84
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,748
Good morning.

85
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:04,249
- Is Dal-suis running late?
- Seems so.

86
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,852
I see.

87
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,943
It's getting bright now.

88
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:29,176
Should've been here by now.

89
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,666
It's cold.

90
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,575
Why don't you wait inside?

91
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,451
I'm late.

92
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,959
It's morning now.

93
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,846
Why am I worrying about it?

94
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,661
Shucks.

95
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,453
Give me one carton, Gramps.

96
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,567
But what if she breaks a hip?

97
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:01,969
- Gramps, I want to buy milk!
- Is that why she's not here?

98
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:07,313
- What is he mumbling about?
- No, that's absurd.

99
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,248
Grandpa!
Milk, please! Milk!

100
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,047
Crazy bastard.

101
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:17,956
Excuse me?

102
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,358
I've got no milk for you!
No milk!

103
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,780
Annoying little punk!

104
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,565
Who does he think he is?

105
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,265
Just looking at you
makes me sick.

106
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,544
Why was he yelling at me?

107
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,545
Sheesh.

108
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,057
Be careful.

109
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,860
Have a nice day.

110
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,162
Hello.

111
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,572
Hello, sir!

112
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,174
Oh!

113
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,872
You're late today.

114
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,651
- Yes, it ended up that way.
- You don't have to shout!

115
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,850
- You have your hearing aid!
- Don't shout now.

116
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,449
I don't wear it when I'm riding,
since it's so loud.

117
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,262
I see.

118
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,465
And who might you be?

119
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,203
He's the manager of
the parking lot.

120
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,068
Mr. JANG Kun-bong.

121
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,870
Nice to meet you.

122
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,278
Well, I have deliveries to make.

123
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,957
What a racket.

124
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,351
It is.

125
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,460
Thanks to that motorcycle,
I'm never late.

126
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,343
- You wanted an alarm clock, right?
- You have one?

127
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,855
I put some rice cakes
in there for your wife.

128
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,855
See you tomorrow.

129
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,562
Dal-su!

130
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,757
- Thanks again.
- It's just a piece of junk.

131
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,050
Honey.

132
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,572
Remember to use
the bedpan next time.

133
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,069
Okay?

134
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,752
Say "ah".

135
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,961
Good.

136
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,461
Chew it well.

137
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,971
What did you do today?

138
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,668
Tell me.

139
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:41,651
I made stew with noodles
for lunch today.

140
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:48,153
Ordering in is easier,
but I had nothing better to do.

141
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:54,557
Dal-su from the junkyard
gave me an alarm clock...

142
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,762
I'll get three hours of sleep.

143
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,759
That's strange.

144
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,961
Why isn't the parking lot open yet?

145
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,869
I'm not sure.

146
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,764
He's never been late before.

147
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,251
My goodness!
I'm late!

148
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,955
He didn't look.

149
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,063
It's cold.

150
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,459
So cold.

151
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:37,962
Grandpa.

152
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,272
Let's get some sleep
on a Sunday.

153
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,765
It's just habit.
I can't help waking up.

154
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,774
Then go for a walk or something.

155
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,140
You want to go?

156
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,244
Sheesh.

157
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,650
I apologize.

158
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,759
Have a nice day.

159
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,862
I apologize again.

160
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,747
Could I ask you a favor?

161
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:43,259
Please go to my house
and lock the front gate.

162
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,170
Take your shoes off
inside the house!

163
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,148
My, my...

164
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,152
She's gone senile.

165
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,756
Don't eat that dirt!

166
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,864
She's completely lost her mind.

167
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,463
Sheesh.

168
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,865
Isn't there a guardian here?

169
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,612
Anyone looking for
a senile old woman?

170
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,876
- Huh?
- Huh!

171
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,442
- It's freezing!
- Freezing!

172
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,551
Jesus, it's freezing.

173
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,394
- What's your home number?
- Jesus. Freezing.

174
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,055
Darn it.

175
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,357
Doesn't know her name
or her address.

176
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,063
Darn it.

177
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,060
I'm going to freeze to death.

178
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,369
What are you doing,
old hag?

179
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,845
Your hair is all white.

180
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,552
Of course it is, at this age.

181
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,550
Don't grow old, dear.

182
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,552
You can't get old.

183
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,661
Don't grow old, darling.

184
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,560
Goddamn it.

185
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,868
What did you do today?
Tell me.

186
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,711
Tell me what you did.

187
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:41,474
Stop pulling!

188
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,247
Tell me!

189
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,745
She's driving me crazy.

190
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,852
- Hurry up. Tell me.
- All right.

191
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,855
Well...

192
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,859
This morning...

193
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,555
I couldn't sleep,
so I was watching TV.

194
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,665
Then Yuna comes and...

195
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,163
- Yuna is my granddaughter.
- I know.

196
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,258
Excuse me?

197
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,357
Is anyone home?

198
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,269
Hello?

199
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,568
What?

200
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,969
The front gate was open?

201
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,366
Honey!

202
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,975
Honey!

203
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,950
- Again.
- What do you mean, again?

204
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,952
I came out to the park
and now I'm stuck with you.

205
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,252
- Start again from park.
- Sheesh.

206
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:07,198
I went for a walk in Siberia
and got stuck with a senile granny.

207
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,001
She took my clothes and shoes
and I'm freezing now.

208
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:10,865
The end.

209
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,671
This old fart has lost his mind.

210
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,871
How could you go to Siberia?

211
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,772
Are you thinking clearly now?

212
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,080
- You know what Siberia is?
- Of course I do.

213
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,747
It's two stops away
on the 105 bus.

214
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:32,255
- Gosh darn it.
- Gosh darn it.

215
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,848
You really don't know
where you live?

216
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,795
- Where did you come from?
- Goodness gracious!

217
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,955
Over there.

218
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,262
Can you find it if we go there?

219
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,666
What am I even asking you for?

220
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:03,753
That tickles!

221
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,552
- Shush.
- Shush!

222
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,494
The kids are inside,
so wait out here.

223
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,859
- You got it?
- Okay.

224
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,960
Why do I bother?

225
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,664
- Stay here.
- Okay.

226
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,777
So cold.

227
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,752
Yay!

228
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,357
That looks fun!

229
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,604
- Follow me!
- Should I push?

230
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:53,764
Hurry up!

231
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,346
This is fun!

232
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,452
Wasn't that Gramps?

233
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,267
Hi!

234
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,159
You'll get sick
running around like that.

235
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,864
We should call the police first.

236
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,060
I'll call the police.

237
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,070
Go check the streets.

238
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,470
Right.

239
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,247
Hey!

240
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,688
- I parked here just yesterday!
- Yes, I know...

241
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:25,355
But no one's here right now.

242
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,258
- Come back later.
- You've got to be kidding.

243
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,060
Hey.

244
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,765
Do you even know who I am?

245
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,260
Shit, that's hot!

246
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,371
You little punk.

247
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:42,873
Who are you?

248
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,375
That's none of your business.

249
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,813
Why does everyone here
look like shit?

250
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,838
You've got shit on your face.

251
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,387
That's no way to talk
to a stranger.

252
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,048
We' re not strangers now.

253
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,253
Bam!

254
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,653
You flinched, asshole.

255
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,665
What?

256
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,468
You want a piece of this?

257
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,066
Can you see it?

258
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,072
Try to see my fist, asshole!

259
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,039
Goddamn...

260
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,456
Use words, sir.

261
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,661
- Get your car out, punk.
- Yes, sir.

262
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,763
You said it was around here.

263
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:50,770
Over by that telephone pole.

264
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,668
We've been there
dozens of times.

265
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,486
What the hell are you
laughing for?

266
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,249
I'm working my butt off here.

267
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,652
What?

268
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,949
Don't glare at me.

269
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,598
All you do is swear,
fucking old fart.

270
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,657
What did you just say to me?

271
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,365
What did you say?

272
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,169
Get off.
Go take a cab.

273
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,207
- Cabs are expensive.
- Then take the bus! Get off!

274
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,174
No!

275
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,373
What?

276
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,513
That's how you want to do this?

277
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:29,571
Fine.

278
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,083
- Get off.
- No.

279
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:32,949
Get off!

280
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,953
Wait. Honey...

281
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,149
I'm not your honey.

282
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,551
Boo...

283
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,458
Boo what?

284
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,661
Poo...

285
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,264
Poop?

286
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,668
- I'm pooping.
- Jesus Christ!

287
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,005
- What am I supposed to do?
- It's coming out.

288
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,166
No, don't!
Hold it in for a minute.

289
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,272
My goodness.

290
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,396
One already came out.

291
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,782
Just hold it in.
Okay?

292
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,443
Pee-pee!

293
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:20,156
She has Alzheimer's,
so she couldn't have gone far.

294
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,981
Please find her.

295
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:25,464
Thank you so much...

296
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,339
What's taking so long?

297
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,548
Are you done yet?

298
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,650
We'll both freeze to death!

299
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:44,750
Granny!

300
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:49,057
You better not be eating it
like you ate that dirt!

301
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,756
Why aren't you answering me?

302
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,264
Granny.

303
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,864
See the toilet paper?
Wipe with that!

304
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,161
Don't get poop on your clothes!

305
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,408
- Excuse me.
- Excuse what?

306
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:04,773
Just hurry up and poop.

307
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,478
What are you doing?

308
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,743
I'm just...

309
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,650
Hey!

310
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,688
Give me back my umbrella,
you thief!

311
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,746
Damn it.

312
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,157
Sheesh.

313
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,561
Honey!

314
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,774
Honey!

315
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,168
Can you hear me?

316
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,639
Honey!

317
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,647
Where are you?

318
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,246
Honey!

319
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,251
Honey!

320
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,055
Where were you?

321
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,456
Where did you go?

322
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:00,955
Are you all right?

323
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,562
Aren't you cold?
Are you okay?

324
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,705
- Where were you?
- I'm sorry.

325
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,967
Are you okay?

326
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,367
- I'm cold.
- Let's get you home.

327
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:20,942
- What took you so long?
- Were you scared?

328
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:26,355
- I want to go home. It's cold.
- Let's go home.

329
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,573
We'll get you warmed up.

330
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,556
- I'm hungry.
- Okay.

331
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,465
- Thank you so much!
- Shucks.

332
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,932
You don't need to thank me.

333
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,264
Hurry and get her home.

334
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,166
Thank you.

335
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,541
Thank you so much.

336
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,567
That's how I wanted to grow old.

337
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:32,453
I'm KIM Man-seok.

338
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,952
What's your name?

339
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:40,855
- I'm SONG.
- What's your first name?

340
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,166
I don't have one.

341
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,369
You don't have a name?

342
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,878
My father was drafted
into the military.

343
00:36:56,514 --> 00:37:02,851
Mother waited for him
to come back and name me.

344
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,446
People began calling me
by my last name,

345
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:12,253
and I was called SONG
ever since.

346
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,461
I came from a small town
in the countryside.

347
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,307
Deep in the mountains
in Kangwon Province.

348
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,775
We'll be set
once we get to Seoul.

349
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,469
Just trust me.

350
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,648
Mom...

351
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,952
I'll come back with lots of money.

352
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,850
We thought we would
make it in Seoul.

353
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:46,755
But there were many people
and not enough jobs.

354
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,670
He slowly changed,

355
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,341
but I stood by him.

356
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:11,052
I'm good at sticking it through.

357
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,556
We eventually had a daughter,

358
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:22,261
and he left to go and
make some money.

359
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:27,765
That was the last time
I saw him.

360
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,670
My child's body began to burn up.

361
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,847
Doctor!

362
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,544
I carried her in my arms

363
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,088
and ran all around town...

364
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:45,555
Save my baby!

365
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,150
But...

366
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,456
Since then,

367
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:58,466
I don't think I've ever been happy.

368
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,073
I'm being punished.

369
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,068
For breaking my mother's heart.

370
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,253
You want me to read this for you?

371
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,367
I don't know how to read.

372
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,264
I see.

373
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,164
Have a seat.

374
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,184
"To SONG"...

375
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,049
To SONG.

376
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,852
They say that fate works in
mysterious ways.

377
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:33,457
You and I walk the same road
every single morning.

378
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:38,157
Some would even call that fate.

379
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,164
But we still don't know each...

380
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,877
- Going somewhere?
- Just out.

381
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,879
- What about dinner?
- No thanks.

382
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:54,442
- But it's you r favorite stew.
- Skipping one meal won't kill me.

383
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,347
Out of the way!

384
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,055
- It's time for dinner.
- I don't want any.

385
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,254
- I made mushroom stew.
- To hell with the mushrooms.

386
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,256
- You' re not eating?
- No!

387
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,860
I'm goddamn sick of
mushroom stew.

388
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:18,965
I'll be waiting at the hill
where we always cross.

389
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,774
"Around six o'clock"...

390
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,137
Goodness.

391
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,541
- It's already past eight.
- I should leave.

392
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,354
Wait...

393
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,449
You forgot your letter!

394
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:42,760
Am I being stood up?

395
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,665
Even if she doesn't like me...

396
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,662
That granny...

397
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:52,269
She could at least come and
tell me in person.

398
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,470
I would've had dinner
if I had known.

399
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,738
Mushroom stew...

400
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:04,647
Oh!

401
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,276
Why, if it isn't SONG!

402
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:33,841
I'm sorry.

403
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,554
- Did you wait long?
- Not at all.

404
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,674
I thought maybe
something came up,

405
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:43,560
so I just had dinner with a friend.

406
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,358
- Did you just get here?
- Yes.

407
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,958
The truth is...

408
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:58,070
I don't know how to read.

409
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,571
You can't read?

410
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:03,843
No.

411
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,660
I told you,
I just ate dinner.

412
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,557
Your nose is running.

413
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,665
Gosh darn it.

414
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,269
I waited for three hours.

415
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,374
You happy now?

416
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,578
Let's go.

417
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,579
As long as I saw you.

418
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,647
Button up.
It's cold.

419
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,176
You know how to tell time, right?

420
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,048
I'll see you then.

421
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,068
You look pretty.

422
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,159
There's a seat.

423
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,742
It looks expensive.
Let's go somewhere else.

424
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,946
How expensive could it possibly be?

425
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,758
Why is it so expensive here?

426
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,966
I didn't bring you out
to eat this crap.

427
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,266
Just try it.

428
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,843
This crap is surprisingly good.

429
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,959
Watch the road.

430
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:46,551
This is the real deal.

431
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,163
You don't drink milk, right?

432
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:55,160
No, I'm going to drink it.

433
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,071
Weren't you lactose intolerant?

434
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:03,739
I'll be fine
if I drink a little at a time.

435
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,345
Milk is good for the bones.

436
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:15,392
- It's all right.
- Sure it is.

437
00:48:15,427 --> 00:48:16,450
Just follow me.

438
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,563
Come on.

439
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,070
What brings you here, Grandpa?

440
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,973
Old people living alone
get money, right?

441
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,669
- The government grants?
- How much is it?

442
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,447
It depends on the situation.

443
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,885
If there are children or not,
and any income...

444
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,250
A rough guess!

445
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,552
- A hundred dollars?
- What?

446
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,658
A hundred and fifty?

447
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:53,597
That wouldn't even pay
the damn gas bill!

448
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:57,158
They'll give me all that money?

449
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,569
Yes.

450
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,407
It'd take more than a month
to save up that much.

451
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:05,574
- Thank you.
- Sure...

452
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:10,080
- Thank you so much.
- It's from the government, not me.

453
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:11,638
Thank them, too.

454
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,545
Thank you.

455
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,654
Thank you so much.

456
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,056
Hurry and register her.

457
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,152
- Did you print out the list of benefits?
- Right.

458
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,664
Here it is.

459
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,756
It's so little!

460
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,061
I'd get her more if I could...

461
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,168
Me too.

462
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,262
Could I have your ID?

463
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,867
I don't have one.

464
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,783
You don't have any ID?

465
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:49,149
No...

466
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:53,056
She can just make one now, right?

467
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,662
You shouldn't impose.

468
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:06,861
They've got more important
government things to do.

469
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:09,872
Government things?

470
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,612
- Expedite her things, Yuna.
- Okay.

471
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:17,637
We'll make you an ID first.

472
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,150
Can I have your name?

473
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,954
SONG.

474
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,758
Your first name?

475
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,053
Well...

476
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,468
Only.

477
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,569
Only what?

478
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,090
You're not understanding me.

479
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,075
It's Only SONG.
Write it down.

480
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,241
Don't try to spell it out.

481
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,146
As in "you're my only one"...
That ONLY!

482
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,252
That's good.

483
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,765
Okay, gorgeous.

484
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,463
Pretend to look away,
and then one, two, three!

485
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,068
Fantastic!

486
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:19,743
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Smile some more.

487
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:24,081
You want to be smiling
in your funeral picture.

488
00:51:24,116 --> 00:51:26,683
- What did you just say?
- What?

489
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:28,241
Why, I oughta...

490
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,352
This is for her ID!

491
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,620
Of course. An ID picture.
Of course.

492
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:36,853
- Get a good shot!
- I will, sir.

493
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,961
All right, gorgeous.

494
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:43,100
Bring up all that energy
from your toes,

495
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:45,402
all the way up,
and two, three!

496
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:47,563
Bravo!

497
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:48,671
Put 'er there!

498
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:56,474
How dare he mess up my hair?
Grumpy old fart.

499
00:51:56,809 --> 00:51:57,907
Bring me the salt!

500
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:03,111
My goodness!

501
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:08,518
- You're back, sir.
- One more picture!

502
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:12,257
- Print one more, idiot.
- Okay.

503
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:13,121
This way.

504
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:19,423
Oh my...

505
00:52:19,665 --> 00:52:21,432
You're playing innocent now?

506
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:26,427
- It's just that our regulations...
- Screw your regulations.

507
00:52:27,172 --> 00:52:29,902
Don't you know who I am?

508
00:52:31,243 --> 00:52:34,303
I'll tell your boss
and fire your ass.

509
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:35,712
I apologize.

510
00:52:35,747 --> 00:52:41,515
I'll be back once I get this checked
at the auto shop.

511
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:45,318
I'm sorry, sir.

512
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:48,119
Have a nice day.

513
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:55,124
Dad.

514
00:52:57,169 --> 00:52:58,329
Young-ok.

515
00:52:59,171 --> 00:53:00,729
What are you doing here?

516
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:04,502
Just...

517
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:11,316
Let's go inside.

518
00:53:13,952 --> 00:53:15,920
Damn it.

519
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:20,925
I should move out of
this rough neighborhood.

520
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:48,019
What the hell?

521
00:53:48,453 --> 00:53:49,720
They covered it up!

522
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:51,723
This is destruction of evidence!

523
00:53:52,257 --> 00:53:55,522
Goddamn it!

524
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:07,129
Anyone home?

525
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:11,302
Granny?

526
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:17,906
What brings you here?

527
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:20,711
Come on in.

528
00:54:22,454 --> 00:54:27,221
Please excuse the mess.

529
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:29,923
Your ID came out.

530
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:33,231
Here.

531
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:40,235
Only SONG.

532
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:45,006
You should receive the grant
starting from next month.

533
00:54:46,445 --> 00:54:48,310
How could I ever thank you?

534
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:52,711
- It's nothing, really.
- How kind of you.

535
00:54:54,052 --> 00:54:56,520
Wait one minute.

536
00:54:56,555 --> 00:54:59,319
- No, I should get going...
- I'll be right back.

537
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:09,531
Granny.

538
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,530
Yes?

539
00:55:13,972 --> 00:55:16,133
Everyone is scared of Grandpa.

540
00:55:16,742 --> 00:55:19,108
Aren't you scared of him?

541
00:55:19,845 --> 00:55:25,806
He has a foul mouth,
but he's soft inside.

542
00:55:27,352 --> 00:55:31,456
When he said your name
back at the town hall...

543
00:55:31,491 --> 00:55:33,014
"Only SONG"...

544
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:36,218
I thought he was really saying,

545
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:39,524
"There's only SONG for me. "

546
00:55:40,866 --> 00:55:42,231
Are you all right?

547
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:49,032
My hand slipped...

548
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:56,648
I think Grandpa really likes you.

549
00:55:56,683 --> 00:55:57,808
Don't you think so?

550
00:56:12,364 --> 00:56:17,631
I shouldn't have brought out
such a humble meal.

551
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,728
No, it's great.

552
00:56:19,971 --> 00:56:21,836
Is this what I think it is?

553
00:56:22,374 --> 00:56:24,399
It's one of my favorite vegetables.

554
00:56:26,244 --> 00:56:27,711
How did you know?

555
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,019
What was your name?

556
00:56:35,454 --> 00:56:38,116
It's KIM Yuna.

557
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:43,317
Just like the pretty girl
who ice skates.

558
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:46,126
People say I look like her too.

559
00:56:55,974 --> 00:56:57,999
And you're really cute too, Granny.

560
00:57:09,054 --> 00:57:11,420
- Digestive medicine, please.
- Sure.

561
00:57:18,964 --> 00:57:23,025
I'm sorry for asking you again.

562
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:26,535
I can help you
with the security deposit.

563
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,507
I know I should see Mom, too...

564
00:57:33,945 --> 00:57:37,711
But the diner is busy.
I'm sorry.

565
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:54,723
Go on.

566
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,915
FIXED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

567
00:58:26,064 --> 00:58:29,830
I'm going to live with
Mom and Dad forever.

568
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:33,955
Don't worry about retirement.

569
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,606
You've got two reliable sons.

570
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:39,174
I'll become rich and support you.

571
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:41,708
- Make a lot, please.
- Don't worry.

572
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,207
We've got nothing
to worry about.

573
00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:51,721
Since the commute is so long...

574
00:58:51,756 --> 00:58:54,725
We're going to move out
once we get married.

575
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,622
I'm sorry we won't be
living with you.

576
00:59:02,367 --> 00:59:03,033
Help yourself.

577
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:05,536
That's how our eldest son left.

578
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:12,605
- You should get going.
- Right.

579
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:15,410
We'll visit often.

580
00:59:17,749 --> 00:59:19,410
There's no need for that.

581
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:34,530
I'm sorry we rushed it
when Mom's health is so bad.

582
00:59:36,768 --> 00:59:38,736
But we'll visit often.

583
00:59:41,072 --> 00:59:47,500
We became people they
talked of visiting often.

584
01:00:00,158 --> 01:00:04,026
Now we 're a couple again.

585
01:00:14,272 --> 01:00:16,240
We used to be a family.

586
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:37,327
Sheesh.

587
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:39,922
Hey, punk.
Did you see SONG?

588
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:42,831
Why are you looking for her?

589
01:00:43,168 --> 01:00:46,535
Don't question me.
Just answer my question.

590
01:00:47,872 --> 01:00:52,944
She's been in the manager's office
a lot these days.

591
01:00:52,979 --> 01:00:53,706
What?

592
01:00:58,149 --> 01:00:59,411
Ocean.

593
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:04,811
O- C-E-A-N...

594
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:10,121
You write well now.

595
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:14,122
Why is he flashing smiles at her?

596
01:01:14,866 --> 01:01:17,426
And why is she smiling back?

597
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,407
You're getting much better.

598
01:01:35,053 --> 01:01:35,712
Jesus!

599
01:01:36,755 --> 01:01:38,518
- Go away!
- What are you doing?

600
01:01:41,459 --> 01:01:42,323
Go!

601
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:52,636
That's good.

602
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:12,414
Have a nice day.

603
01:02:19,464 --> 01:02:20,931
What are you doing here?

604
01:02:26,471 --> 01:02:27,529
I should get going.

605
01:02:28,973 --> 01:02:30,406
Are you looking for SONG?

606
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,909
Don't call her SONG.

607
01:02:32,944 --> 01:02:34,809
Her name is Only SONG now.

608
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:40,308
- Ms. SONG went to my house.
- What?

609
01:02:40,652 --> 01:02:42,415
You dragged her
into your house now?

610
01:02:42,754 --> 01:02:45,922
You're always swearing so much.

611
01:02:45,957 --> 01:02:49,825
And you're that popular
because you don't?

612
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,646
Let's go inside.

613
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:54,831
Let's have some tea.

614
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:57,728
" Let's have some tea. "

615
01:02:57,969 --> 01:03:00,233
He doesn't get
how serious this is.

616
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:09,210
Here.

617
01:03:11,149 --> 01:03:13,014
It's a pinwheel!

618
01:03:15,453 --> 01:03:17,011
It's spinning!

619
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:23,420
- You're good at it.
- Thank you.

620
01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:27,228
I don't drink coffee!

621
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:36,331
You can't take her away
with this lousy coffee.

622
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:38,600
Don't you see this?

623
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:41,508
I'm tougher than I look!

624
01:03:44,649 --> 01:03:52,522
I'll speak casually since
we're about the same age.

625
01:03:52,757 --> 01:03:54,816
See if I care.

626
01:03:56,261 --> 01:04:00,527
I'm teaching her how to read.

627
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:03,134
How to read?

628
01:04:03,568 --> 01:04:06,537
Do you know
what she learned to spell first?

629
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:10,205
Your name.
KIM Man-seok.

630
01:04:12,343 --> 01:04:14,208
Drink up before it gets cold.

631
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,717
It tastes pretty good.

632
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:38,929
How sweet.

633
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,303
You're pretty jumpy these days.

634
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:45,809
You're home early.

635
01:04:45,844 --> 01:04:48,506
I gave Granny SONG her ID today.

636
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:50,614
You did?

637
01:04:51,449 --> 01:04:52,507
Grandpa.

638
01:04:53,151 --> 01:04:55,016
You like her, don't you?

639
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:56,611
What?

640
01:04:57,155 --> 01:04:59,214
You like Granny SONG.

641
01:04:59,757 --> 01:05:00,724
Me?

642
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:02,423
Yes.

643
01:05:04,162 --> 01:05:07,325
- That's what you sensed?
- Yes.

644
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:12,525
You think she'd sense it too?

645
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:14,738
Of course.

646
01:05:15,773 --> 01:05:17,502
Aw, shucks.

647
01:05:18,042 --> 01:05:19,703
Go tell her.

648
01:05:20,445 --> 01:05:22,413
It's enough if she senses it.

649
01:05:22,647 --> 01:05:25,411
- You have to tell her yourself.
- Why?

650
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:29,411
Because Granny SONG is a woman too.

651
01:05:29,954 --> 01:05:33,822
Telling her yourself makes
all the difference.

652
01:05:38,763 --> 01:05:40,230
What do I say?

653
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:45,370
" I love you, dear. "

654
01:05:45,405 --> 01:05:48,134
You're crazy!

655
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:50,707
You have to tell her.

656
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:53,302
Go and tell her,
"I love you, dear. "

657
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:01,418
Yuna.

658
01:06:03,154 --> 01:06:07,215
For people our age,
"dear" is meant for our spouses.

659
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,220
What that means is...

660
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:14,923
"Dear" is only for
your late grandmother.

661
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:17,534
It's the least respect
that I can pay her.

662
01:06:24,642 --> 01:06:28,203
I looked at her ID
and her birthday is tomorrow.

663
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:30,607
Good night.

664
01:06:38,656 --> 01:06:41,921
Wait for me, dear.

665
01:06:45,263 --> 01:06:47,629
Slow down, please.

666
01:06:48,366 --> 01:06:50,568
What are you dawdling for?

667
01:06:50,603 --> 01:06:52,229
Hurry up.

668
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:08,617
- Help me move the table.
- Lazy old woman.

669
01:07:08,753 --> 01:07:11,017
You can carry it one at a time.

670
01:07:12,557 --> 01:07:15,321
Pick up some digestive medicine.

671
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,024
At least pretend to listen to me!

672
01:07:20,965 --> 01:07:24,734
How could you not know
when it's gotten so severe?

673
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:29,729
If the cancer spread so much,
shouldn't she be in pain?

674
01:07:31,442 --> 01:07:35,708
She probably was,
in a great amount of pain.

675
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:44,412
Dear, buy me some milk.

676
01:07:44,856 --> 01:07:47,723
Why milk, all of a sudden?

677
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,807
- You're going yourself?
- Who else is there to go?

678
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:06,809
Why not?

679
01:08:06,844 --> 01:08:11,110
She can't have
any dairy products.

680
01:08:11,949 --> 01:08:15,510
- Just let her have one.
- Give it to me, sir.

681
01:08:16,654 --> 01:08:17,720
I mean it.

682
01:08:17,755 --> 01:08:21,159
- But she wants some milk.
- No, she can't.

683
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:22,922
She won't have any more.

684
01:08:23,161 --> 01:08:28,531
They're saying that milk
isn't good for you.

685
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:31,030
This is nice, though.

686
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:36,033
Having my blunt husband
taking care of me for once.

687
01:08:36,374 --> 01:08:39,605
Just get well.
I'll buy you milk every day.

688
01:08:52,857 --> 01:08:56,623
Would you be all right?

689
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:08,034
Would it be okay if I do?

690
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:39,033
Where are all the small rocks?

691
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:46,107
It's rather big...

692
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,613
Can I come in for a minute?

693
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:13,332
You're not curious about
why I didn't work today?

694
01:10:16,274 --> 01:10:20,404
I'm sure you had some reason.

695
01:10:21,546 --> 01:10:23,514
You wouldn't for no reason.

696
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:28,619
So, you didn't wait for me?

697
01:10:32,056 --> 01:10:33,819
I waited.

698
01:10:38,763 --> 01:10:41,323
The kitchen's through here?

699
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:52,399
Stay right there.

700
01:11:50,668 --> 01:11:53,728
It's your birthday today.

701
01:11:56,741 --> 01:11:57,799
Should we get the lights?

702
01:12:00,244 --> 01:12:01,302
Yes.

703
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:08,312
No, I meant those lights.

704
01:12:21,565 --> 01:12:22,725
Wait.

705
01:12:23,668 --> 01:12:26,728
Why are you in such a hurry?

706
01:12:37,648 --> 01:12:41,602
Happy birthday to you.

707
01:12:41,637 --> 01:12:45,178
Happy birthday to you.

708
01:12:45,213 --> 01:12:48,719
You could clap along.

709
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:54,825
Happy birthday
my Only SONG.

710
01:12:55,566 --> 01:13:00,026
Happy birthday to you.

711
01:13:02,673 --> 01:13:05,904
Dam n lyrics.

712
01:13:08,446 --> 01:13:12,610
I wanted to get you
a cheap ring or something,

713
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,611
but the stores were closed.

714
01:13:15,553 --> 01:13:16,713
Here.

715
01:13:19,156 --> 01:13:20,714
My arm is hurting.

716
01:13:32,169 --> 01:13:33,636
You're not opening it?

717
01:14:08,072 --> 01:14:10,302
My dear...

718
01:14:14,545 --> 01:14:16,103
I love you.

719
01:14:40,671 --> 01:14:43,504
You can blow them out now.

720
01:15:24,648 --> 01:15:28,106
THANK YOU, KIM MAN-SEOK.
FROM ONLY SONG

721
01:17:30,641 --> 01:17:32,643
What did you do today?

722
01:17:32,678 --> 01:17:34,611
Tell me.

723
01:17:38,749 --> 01:17:42,708
Well...

724
01:17:43,153 --> 01:17:48,523
I don't know what I'm doing,
to be honest.

725
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:53,923
My mind is elsewhere all day.

726
01:17:56,767 --> 01:18:01,727
Like I'm dreaming
with my eyes open.

727
01:18:02,172 --> 01:18:03,036
Eyes open?

728
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:15,607
How long has it been like this?

729
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:18,014
I don't know.

730
01:18:29,566 --> 01:18:33,730
My tummy hurts a lot.

731
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,109
She's okay, right?

732
01:18:49,453 --> 01:18:51,318
What did they say?

733
01:18:59,363 --> 01:19:01,331
Should we all go on a picnic?

734
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:09,997
This is the taxi I used to drive.

735
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:17,205
No one would take it and
I couldn't throw it away, either.

736
01:19:18,849 --> 01:19:21,317
A lot like us, eh?

737
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:31,820
I don't know if I could...
go on without her.

738
01:20:32,656 --> 01:20:35,625
The test results aren't even back yet.

739
01:20:38,061 --> 01:20:39,824
Honey!

740
01:20:47,571 --> 01:20:49,129
Look here, Kun-bong.

741
01:20:51,942 --> 01:20:53,807
I don't have any friends.

742
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:57,605
Because of my bad temper, I guess.

743
01:20:58,949 --> 01:21:00,507
Is that okay, though?

744
01:21:01,151 --> 01:21:05,918
Seems I've made a new friend
at this old age.

745
01:21:22,773 --> 01:21:25,207
You came to us too late.

746
01:21:25,843 --> 01:21:30,303
The best we can do is to
relieve her with painkillers.

747
01:21:30,547 --> 01:21:32,515
You should prepare yourself...

748
01:21:40,457 --> 01:21:42,118
Mommy...

749
01:21:47,464 --> 01:21:49,329
Don't cry.

750
01:21:52,269 --> 01:21:57,297
If you cry, then I cry too.

751
01:22:11,755 --> 01:22:14,417
Why is it so cold this spring?

752
01:22:43,854 --> 01:22:47,157
Why are you here?
I have to work, Grandpa.

753
01:22:47,192 --> 01:22:49,125
Work.
Don't mind me.

754
01:22:53,964 --> 01:22:55,831
How does this work?

755
01:22:55,866 --> 01:22:58,426
It's not for you, Grandpa.

756
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:03,797
- Did you buy gloves?
- Oh, no.

757
01:23:04,341 --> 01:23:07,504
- Did they catch your eye, though?
- What?

758
01:23:08,145 --> 01:23:10,807
I didn't buy them.
They were a gift.

759
01:23:10,948 --> 01:23:14,111
Nice and soft
because it's real leather.

760
01:23:16,954 --> 01:23:19,115
How did you notice
when I didn't say anything?

761
01:23:20,457 --> 01:23:23,119
Because it's high quality leather, eh?

762
01:23:24,061 --> 01:23:26,120
Have a nice day everyone!

763
01:23:26,663 --> 01:23:28,722
Come straight home after work.

764
01:23:34,471 --> 01:23:36,905
Good day, gentlemen.

765
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,306
What brings you here, Gramps?

766
01:23:40,344 --> 01:23:44,007
- That looks like a bad move.
- You even have gloves on.

767
01:23:44,648 --> 01:23:46,513
Well, aren't you sharp!

768
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:50,654
- How'd you know that it's leather?
- I never said anything about leather...

769
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:54,420
It's different from
that fake synthetic stuff.

770
01:23:54,558 --> 01:23:56,760
No air slips in
between the fingers.

771
01:23:56,795 --> 01:23:57,624
Take a look.

772
01:24:02,466 --> 01:24:03,626
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

773
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:08,032
Have a nice day, then.

774
01:24:08,972 --> 01:24:09,996
You too, Gramps.

775
01:24:12,342 --> 01:24:14,105
Is he sick or something?

776
01:24:15,245 --> 01:24:18,806
Real leather does sound nice, though.

777
01:24:22,452 --> 01:24:23,510
Huh?

778
01:24:24,054 --> 01:24:25,521
Academy lessons?

779
01:24:26,156 --> 01:24:29,319
Missing one day won't kill him.

780
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,227
Bring him with you.

781
01:24:32,562 --> 01:24:35,122
NOW HIRING? MANAGER

782
01:24:35,465 --> 01:24:37,228
We'll be waiting for you then.
All right. Bye.

783
01:24:38,168 --> 01:24:40,830
- What's that sign for?
- You're here.

784
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:44,004
Is it because of your wife?

785
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:52,609
I was thinking about
taking her on a trip.

786
01:24:54,951 --> 01:24:58,655
- Is that from SONG?
- Yeah, isn't it nice?

787
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:01,624
It's real cow leather.
Nice and soft.

788
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:08,426
Hello?
It's you.

789
01:25:08,965 --> 01:25:11,331
As long as you're coming.

790
01:25:11,468 --> 01:25:13,026
Don't be late.

791
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:15,829
And bring the kids.

792
01:25:16,373 --> 01:25:19,308
We'll be waiting.
All right.

793
01:25:25,649 --> 01:25:28,617
Are they thinking of
moving in with us?

794
01:25:28,652 --> 01:25:32,713
- You know we have two kids, right?
- Come on.

795
01:25:32,956 --> 01:25:34,423
We have kids too.

796
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:37,119
My kids are in high school.

797
01:25:37,861 --> 01:25:41,422
Should we look into
a cheap nursing home?

798
01:25:42,566 --> 01:25:44,329
They have Young-ok.

799
01:25:44,568 --> 01:25:46,433
She's their favorite, anyway.

800
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:49,630
- You two come inside too.
- Yes, sir!

801
01:25:58,148 --> 01:26:01,117
We're all here, Dad.

802
01:26:05,255 --> 01:26:06,517
Honey.

803
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:18,029
These kids...

804
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:23,201
You brought them into the world.

805
01:26:24,941 --> 01:26:27,000
So many of them, eh?

806
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:45,021
You did good, honey.

807
01:26:47,264 --> 01:26:50,233
Is there something wrong, Dad?

808
01:26:51,968 --> 01:26:55,927
- You can all go now.
- What?

809
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,905
- Go on.
- Dad.

810
01:27:00,844 --> 01:27:02,209
Get up.

811
01:27:05,448 --> 01:27:06,415
Come on.

812
01:27:25,468 --> 01:27:29,336
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- No need for that.

813
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:34,007
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

814
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:36,412
Get on home.

815
01:27:37,747 --> 01:27:38,805
Go.

816
01:27:55,065 --> 01:27:56,123
Go on.

817
01:27:57,267 --> 01:28:00,532
- Go.
- Thank you. Come again.

818
01:28:12,449 --> 01:28:14,815
Goodbye all of you.

819
01:28:19,256 --> 01:28:22,020
You can sleep in now.

820
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,026
- Is this everything?
- Yes.

821
01:28:29,766 --> 01:28:31,468
Wait, I'll take that!

822
01:28:31,503 --> 01:28:33,436
Woah!

823
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:36,131
Are you all right?

824
01:28:36,273 --> 01:28:39,003
- Are you hurt?
- How typical of me.

825
01:28:39,743 --> 01:28:42,906
What are you taking these for?

826
01:28:44,447 --> 01:28:46,210
It's such a waste.

827
01:28:53,957 --> 01:28:57,222
You wear them everywhere,
don't you?

828
01:28:58,662 --> 01:29:01,222
These are special gloves, buddy.

829
01:29:04,467 --> 01:29:09,996
Be good to SONG, Man-seok.

830
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:17,747
We could all go any day now,
at this old age.

831
01:29:17,782 --> 01:29:21,308
Stop trying to sound so wise.

832
01:31:24,941 --> 01:31:31,813
We've had such a long life together.

833
01:31:36,953 --> 01:31:44,223
I'd still pick you in my next life.
What about you?

834
01:31:52,368 --> 01:31:58,102
You always gave to me
and I only took from you.

835
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:00,703
I couldn't do that to you again

836
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,528
You know what?

837
01:32:21,464 --> 01:32:23,728
You're so beautiful.

838
01:32:25,768 --> 01:32:30,296
- More beautiful with age.
- Liar.

839
01:32:34,344 --> 01:32:36,209
I'm serious.

840
01:33:15,752 --> 01:33:18,118
Don't cry.

841
01:33:25,061 --> 01:33:27,029
It's bitter.

842
01:33:32,468 --> 01:33:34,026
I'm so sorry.

843
01:34:11,941 --> 01:34:13,602
Goodbye.

844
01:34:17,146 --> 01:34:19,410
I'm a timid old man.

845
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:23,612
I couldn't go on without you.

846
01:34:26,956 --> 01:34:32,121
So hold on tight to my hand.

847
01:34:36,666 --> 01:34:41,126
Let's find each other again.

848
01:34:53,149 --> 01:34:54,207
Gramps.

849
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:59,455
Someone named JANG Kun-bong
left this for you yesterday.

850
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:03,323
- Kun-bong was here?
- Someone like that.

851
01:35:12,669 --> 01:35:14,534
Dear Man-seok...

852
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,504
I was quite lonely,

853
01:35:20,343 --> 01:35:25,906
but I enjoyed my time
with you and SONG.

854
01:35:31,854 --> 01:35:33,617
Thanks to you two,

855
01:35:34,457 --> 01:35:39,326
we now have
good memories to cherish.

856
01:35:40,663 --> 01:35:42,631
For so many years,

857
01:35:43,366 --> 01:35:48,429
my wife and I have
depended on each other.

858
01:35:49,939 --> 01:35:54,000
I was afraid of being left behind.

859
01:35:58,748 --> 01:36:04,118
So I've decided to go with my wife.

860
01:36:06,355 --> 01:36:11,520
Since we've always been
at each other's side.

861
01:36:15,164 --> 01:36:16,722
Man-seok.

862
01:36:19,168 --> 01:36:20,931
I have a favor to ask.

863
01:36:22,472 --> 01:36:30,004
I don't want the world
to know how we left.

864
01:36:33,049 --> 01:36:38,009
Don't want to cause trouble
for our children.

865
01:36:41,758 --> 01:36:43,419
Thank you, my friend.

866
01:37:22,165 --> 01:37:25,225
JANG'S HOUSE

867
01:37:56,966 --> 01:38:02,336
Damn fool worried for his kids
even as he died.

868
01:38:07,543 --> 01:38:09,306
You did the right thing.

869
01:38:10,046 --> 01:38:15,006
Kun-bong would be very grateful.

870
01:38:27,663 --> 01:38:29,324
How did they pass away?

871
01:38:31,267 --> 01:38:33,827
They slept through a gas leak.

872
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:36,431
heard they were a loving couple.

873
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,999
- How old were they?
- Seventy-seven, I heard.

874
01:38:42,445 --> 01:38:45,414
- It was quite timely.
- Su re.

875
01:38:45,848 --> 01:38:48,951
They would've just lived
to burden their children.

876
01:38:48,986 --> 01:38:53,718
- It was timely.
- Better than troubling their kids.

877
01:38:54,357 --> 01:38:56,825
That's what everyone is saying.

878
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,520
What's so timely about it,
you punks!

879
01:39:01,364 --> 01:39:03,231
What's so timely about it?

880
01:39:03,266 --> 01:39:08,226
- We didn't mean it like that, sir.
- How can any death be good?

881
01:39:08,571 --> 01:39:10,596
Should all us old folks just die?

882
01:39:11,841 --> 01:39:13,001
Crazy bastards!

883
01:39:14,443 --> 01:39:18,004
Timely, my ass!

884
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:31,918
Kun-bong!

885
01:39:33,462 --> 01:39:37,023
They're saying that
you died at a good time!

886
01:39:38,868 --> 01:39:42,531
That it's good you died,
you damn fool.

887
01:39:57,153 --> 01:39:58,518
Only...

888
01:39:59,655 --> 01:40:01,816
What's on your mind?

889
01:40:09,765 --> 01:40:11,232
Man-seok...

890
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:16,804
Why are you stalling?

891
01:40:32,755 --> 01:40:34,814
You're going back
to your hometown?

892
01:40:35,358 --> 01:40:37,519
Because you don't want
to lose me?

893
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:40,221
That's right.

894
01:40:41,464 --> 01:40:44,433
Because I don't want
to lose you.

895
01:40:46,469 --> 01:40:51,702
Death will tear us apart
soon enough,

896
01:40:53,843 --> 01:40:56,209
and I don't think
I could stand it.

897
01:40:59,348 --> 01:41:04,615
How could I let you go?

898
01:41:07,556 --> 01:41:09,717
The first happiness of my life...

899
01:41:10,659 --> 01:41:14,720
I want to go back home,

900
01:41:15,564 --> 01:41:19,625
and grow old cherishing it.

901
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:22,732
Listen to me.

902
01:41:23,339 --> 01:41:25,500
You think
we can meet again?

903
01:41:25,941 --> 01:41:27,499
We'll never see each other again!

904
01:41:38,254 --> 01:41:41,121
Go, then.
Just leave me!

905
01:41:41,457 --> 01:41:42,924
Let's never see each other again!

906
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:47,124
Don't even come
if you hear that I died!

907
01:43:46,048 --> 01:43:48,107
I'll take you.

908
01:43:51,554 --> 01:43:53,419
To your home.

909
01:44:09,672 --> 01:44:12,197
WELCOME TO SURARI HILL
600M ABOVE SEA LEVEL

910
01:44:19,448 --> 01:44:20,915
Only...

911
01:44:25,454 --> 01:44:27,820
I just felt like saying your name.

912
01:44:32,461 --> 01:44:33,928
Man-seok...

913
01:44:38,567 --> 01:44:41,035
I just wanted to say it too.

914
01:45:21,443 --> 01:45:25,812
Could I hold you once?

915
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:19,134
Could we see each other again?

916
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:24,104
Could we see each other
before we die?

917
01:48:07,242 --> 01:48:09,710
- Grandpa.
- Yeah.

918
01:48:10,946 --> 01:48:14,109
- You're here again?
- Coming from work?

919
01:48:19,755 --> 01:48:22,417
Why did you let her go, then?

920
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:28,318
Don't worry.
This will pass.

921
01:48:31,767 --> 01:48:33,632
I'll get used to it.

922
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:37,696
Life is about
getting used to things.

923
01:48:48,851 --> 01:48:50,819
This is our house.

924
01:48:53,455 --> 01:48:57,221
So you moved in here.

925
01:48:57,459 --> 01:49:00,223
Yes, with my mom.

926
01:49:14,443 --> 01:49:15,808
That's sweet of you.

927
01:49:16,245 --> 01:49:18,912
The granny who lived here
asked me to.

928
01:49:18,947 --> 01:49:22,314
She said it's dangerous
for motorcycles in the dark.
