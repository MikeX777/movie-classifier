1
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:17,218
TRANSMISSION

2
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:04,613
Paulo, let's go.

3
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,777
Do you hear me?

4
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,934
I'm talking to you!

5
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,775
One...

6
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,250
Two...

7
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,933
Two and a quarter,
don't let me get to three...

8
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,255
Two and a half,
I'm warning you, Paulo!

9
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,649
Three.

10
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,652
Give it to me!

11
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,096
Give it, Mom!
Come on!

12
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,653
Give it to me!

13
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:44,369
Careful!

14
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:55,257
I'm sorry,
I'll get you another.

15
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,136
- I don't want another one.
- It was an accident!

16
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:06,132
Paulo!

17
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,846
How was school?

18
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:30,924
You're never going to talk
to me again, is that it?

19
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,967
That's a shame...

20
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:37,128
I bought that chocolate ice cream
you love,

21
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:41,965
but since you're so mad,
you won't want it, will you?

22
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:52,133
- Who is it?
- Isabel!

23
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:56,373
- You're going out again?
- I'm going out with a friend.

24
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:04,968
Hello?

25
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:07,889
Yes, yes, come up.

26
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,451
Happy birthday to you

27
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,565
Happy birthday, my dear

28
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:21,843
Happy birthday to you

29
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,565
Paulo...

30
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,609
I'm waiting for my kiss.

31
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,727
Mummy'll be sad.

32
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:55,522
Goodnight then,
sleep well, my angel.

33
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,209
'Night, mom.

34
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,481
- See you later, Isabel.
- 'Bye, Teresa, have fun.

35
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,000
Paulo...

36
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:06,395
There you are!

37
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:42,113
Good morning!

38
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:47,839
Are you still asleep?

39
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:51,675
Mom,
what happened to grandad?

40
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,082
Nothing!

41
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:57,237
Not that one,
the other one, dad's dad.

42
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,955
I don't know,
I haven't seen him for ages.

43
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,042
But why don't I know him?

44
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,112
I'll tell you one day,
when you're older.

45
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:11,480
When? When I'm your age?
Why can't I know now?

46
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:14,798
Finish your breakfast
you'll be late.

47
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:17,558
Go on, mom, tell me.

48
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:20,521
Your grandfather lives a long way away,
that's all.

49
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:23,912
- But I want to meet him!
- That's enough!

50
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,513
Get a move on.

51
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:35,599
I tell you, he moved!
I just have to meet him.

52
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:39,793
- But won't your mom let you?
- Didn't you see the ball, stupid?

53
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:41,877
It's your turn.

54
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,149
What's that?

55
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,438
My mom's working during the holidays,
she's signed me in this summer camp.

56
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,312
But I'm going to look
for my grandad instead.

57
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,476
- What if she finds out?
- I'll take my mobile.

58
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,477
When she rings,
I'll pretend I'm at the camp.

59
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,953
But I'm going to need your help.

60
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,634
Take lots of pictures.

61
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:20,791
I wish I could go with you,
can't you fit me in your bag?

62
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,110
I can now.

63
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,517
I've got a present for you.

64
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:39,508
- Well?
- Yes! You look great!

65
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:45,035
Here. Don't put it all
in the same place.

66
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:59,436
This is to eat on the bus.

67
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:02,552
Okay...

68
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:06,905
Wait.

69
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,631
I'm going to miss you.

70
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,910
Let me dress,
I'll come down with you.

71
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:16,667
It's all right, mom.

72
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:19,070
André and his mom and dad
are waiting for me downstairs

73
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:21,105
and we're already late.

74
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:25,590
That's the one I owe you
from the other night.

75
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,943
Off you go. Be good!

76
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:41,663
What did I tell you? It was easy.

77
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:44,830
Easy for you, you didn't have to
persuade my brother to bring the car.

78
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:48,588
- Come on, hurry up!
- Nice one, how did you do it?

79
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:53,548
I caught him bumming fags off dad,
I said I'd tell mom if he didn't.

80
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:08,790
You owe me one!

81
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,099
Where are you going today,
Mr. Salgado?

82
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,025
There're so many possibilities,
it's hard to choose!

83
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:47,869
Well... I'm off.

84
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,508
See you later.

85
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,655
A ticket to Estremoz, please.

86
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:09,820
Well? Where did you go today?

87
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:13,371
I went to Seville to see Cordobéz.

88
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,169
He was magnificent... magnificent!

89
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,725
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Monte da Ribeira,

90
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,206
Mr. Miguel Salgado.

91
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,808
Well now...!

92
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:45,565
We have a visitor!

93
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:50,365
Look at you, you're not old
enough to drink even!

94
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:56,366
How old are you, young fella?

95
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,203
- Ten?
- What if I am?

96
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:04,931
If you are, it's no age to be out
on your own! Where's your mom?

97
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:07,124
I'm looking for my grandfather.

98
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,608
Your grandfather?
Who is your grandfather?

99
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,484
Mr. Miguel Salgado

100
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:17,849
Come on, I'll show you the way
to Mr. Salgado's place.

101
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:40,240
Right then!

102
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:46,247
Just follow this trail,
it'll take you straight there.

103
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,766
'Bye.

104
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,248
Thank you, Mr. ...

105
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,330
Corvo.

106
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,043
Lúcio Corvo.

107
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:50,558
Hello?

108
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:52,606
Hi, mom.

109
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:54,961
What?

110
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,325
Ah, it's because
I'm playing hide and seek.

111
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:01,159
I'll 'phone later.

112
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,756
Yeah...

113
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,920
Mom, I already said yes.

114
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,800
Yes, I miss you, too.

115
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:15,440
Oy! What are you doing here?

116
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:18,325
I... I'm looking
for Mr. Miguel Salgado.

117
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:22,558
What do you want with him?
He's very busy at the moment.

118
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:24,757
He... he's my grandad.

119
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,324
Your grandad?

120
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,317
Little Paulo?

121
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,801
Let me look at you!

122
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:39,035
You're so big!

123
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:42,479
Come, come with me!

124
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:50,677
Mr. Salgado...

125
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,721
I've got a surprise for you!

126
00:17:56,204 --> 00:18:00,116
- It's a bit small for a surprise.
- I'm not small.

127
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,279
What's the matter, is he lost?

128
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,991
Tell him who you are!

129
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,515
Who are you?

130
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:21,714
It's me, grandad.

131
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:37,756
- Don't you like the soup?
- It's fine.

132
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:41,675
When's your mother getting here?

133
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:44,960
She had to stay in Lisbon,
working.

134
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:47,270
But she knows you came?

135
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:48,549
Sure...!

136
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,676
And why didn't she tell me
you were coming?

137
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,951
She thought a surprise
would be nicer.

138
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,156
You don't want more soup?

139
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,028
All right.

140
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,912
Make up a bed in Carlos' room.

141
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,428
Come on.

142
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:28,267
Well?

143
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,068
What do you think of the colour?

144
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:33,471
It's red.

145
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:37,157
Taste it.

146
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,591
Go on, try it! Go on!

147
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:50,595
Put it in your mouth, swill it
round then spit it out there.

148
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:51,865
Go on!

149
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,950
Don't go near that one,
he's got a temper.

150
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:11,270
This one here's much nicer.

151
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:15,145
- You can even go for a ride.
- I never rode a horse!

152
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:18,471
On his nose, stroke his nose,
they like that.

153
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,392
Come on, let's go.

154
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:36,593
- It looks like new. Is it broken?
- No, it's in mint condition!

155
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:39,188
Always ready to take off.

156
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:44,308
- Grandad, it'll never take off from here!
- It doesn't have to, it's special!

157
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:47,663
It'll take me anywhere I want.

158
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:51,185
- But what happened to it?
- Nothing.

159
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:54,704
No, no, come here.

160
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,064
No one sits there.

161
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:02,343
But grandad,
we'll never get anywhere like this.

162
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:04,303
It depends where you want to go.

163
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:07,146
- To Lisbon?
- No, not there.

164
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:09,262
Too many people, lots of buildings,
too much confusion!

165
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:11,906
- And what about going to the clouds?
- Ah, that's different.

166
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:16,742
These cars are very good for clouds!
In fact, the angels use these cars!

167
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,105
It's true, I've seen it!

168
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:22,429
They have no wheels, no indicators, the
roads are wide, there are no accidents!

169
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:24,302
I don't believe you.

170
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:26,347
You don't?

171
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:31,588
That's bad. At your age you
should believe in everything.

172
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,462
All right, take me.

173
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:35,542
No, not now.

174
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,542
We're going home now,

175
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,789
Irene will give you a bath
then we'll have dinner.

176
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,226
- Oh grandad!
- That's enough, come on, let's go!

177
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,220
- Hello, grandad.
- Hello.

178
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,452
You're just in time,
you can finish this for me.

179
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:35,018
Grandad.

180
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:40,934
If I wash the car,
can I go with you?

181
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:42,581
Let me see....

182
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:45,937
No.

183
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:07,889
It's true,
we're really in the sky.

184
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:10,008
You can see it?

185
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:39,096
- How'd you do that, it was so cool!
- I didn't do anything.

186
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:40,052
It happens.

187
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:43,495
Grandad, can we go again?

188
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:00,286
What do you think you're doing?

189
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,882
Don't you know kids your age
don't drive? Out, get out now!

190
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,919
I'm sorry.

191
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:11,721
Promise me you'll never get
in this car on your own again.

192
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,324
No, no,
I want to hear your voice.

193
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,840
You have to realize
that words are important!

194
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,649
I promise.

195
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:30,488
Now if we behave ourselves...

196
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:33,765
... this afternoon
we'll go for a spin in the car.

197
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:35,362
Come on, son.

198
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,798
Is grandad a magician?

199
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:49,482
Well, I don't think so, I've never
seen him pull a rabbit out of a hat.

200
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:54,204
It's not that. It's the car,
how does he make the car do that?

201
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:57,923
- He took you in the car?
- Yes, it was amazing!

202
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:02,119
You're luckier than me, he's taken me
once or twice and nothing happened.

203
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:07,480
- The car didn't budge an inch.
- He said he'd take me again.

204
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:18,004
Grandad, if my dad was alive,
do you think he'd look like you?

205
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:22,559
He was much slimmer than me.

206
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:27,282
But do you think we'd all
have lived here, together?

207
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,157
Of course, of course we would.

208
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:35,484
It's a house we could have all lived in,
there was enough room for everyone.

209
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:38,039
Who decides things like that?

210
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:42,683
I used to think no one did.

211
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:46,677
Not anymore.

212
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,397
Now I'm not so sure.

213
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:53,920
- Grandad, what happened...
- Stop asking questions!

214
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:58,441
You want to know too much!
What happened, how it happened...!

215
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:02,515
I'd really like to know
what might've been...

216
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,592
- Hello.
- Hi!

217
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,550
Hello!

218
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,439
Hi, grandad!

219
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,673
Jorge, show Paulo your drawing.

220
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:27,435
- Dad!
- Hello, son.

221
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,186
Hi, honey.

222
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:38,672
- How was your day, son?
- I... dad...

223
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,147
I've got great hopes for the wine
this year.

224
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:45,266
Me too.

225
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,347
When production really gets going,
we'll have the best wine in the Alentejo.

226
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:50,910
Shall we eat?

227
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:57,265
Come on, love, you too.

228
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:07,869
- What's the matter? Trouble at school?
- No.

229
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:09,510
What's wrong?

230
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:13,150
Stop it! It's not real!

231
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:21,113
Grandad, what happened?

232
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:25,274
You lied to me about your mother.

233
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:29,068
She doesn't know here, does she?

234
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:35,666
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Grandad, please.

235
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:12,946
Paulo...

236
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:16,263
Come with me.

237
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,227
Take my hand, ok... there!

238
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,383
You're heavy.

239
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:00,507
See you later.

240
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:54,421
Give me your hand...

241
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:21,381
I want you to have this key.

242
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,701
From now on,
the car's as much your as mine.

243
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:28,379
But you must be careful,
there's only two.

244
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:31,382
Mine and yours, no one else's.

245
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:36,814
Promise me one thing.

246
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:41,412
As long as I'm alive, you'll never
drive this car on your own.

247
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:45,493
I promise, grandad.

248
00:34:58,902 --> 00:34:59,891
Grandad...

249
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:02,852
What's going on?

250
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:06,895
It's time for you to go back home.

251
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:21,012
But I want to see my father again!

252
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:28,332
You've already shown me you're a man.
Don't try and get round me by whining.

253
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,813
Please, grandad!

254
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,655
No, come on, let's go.

255
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:47,416
Goodbye, kid.

256
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,451
- See he gets to Lisbon safely.
- Don't worry.

257
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:42,143
Blast you!

258
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:46,870
I've put petrol in, checked the oil,
the spark plugs, what more do you want?

259
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:05,423
Have it your way!
Stay here on your own!

260
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:33,227
Are you tired?

261
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,630
Don't worry, I'm tired too.

262
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,870
So, you fixed the car then?

263
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:18,582
Are you going to tell grandad
I'm here?

264
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:20,859
No, of course not.

265
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:25,382
- Thank you.
- You're going to tell him.

266
00:44:41,027 --> 00:44:42,506
What's this?

267
00:44:43,987 --> 00:44:46,740
Didn't I tell you to go home?

268
00:44:52,387 --> 00:44:55,298
I'm very disappointed in you.

269
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:59,180
- What am I going to do now?
- I tried to start the car.

270
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:03,865
I know I promised I wouldn't,
but it works, it's not broken!

271
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:05,185
Never mind that.

272
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:09,779
Ring your mother
and tell her where you are.

273
00:45:25,745 --> 00:45:27,781
It's the voice mail.

274
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,576
Leave a message.

275
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,537
Mom, it's me Paulo.

276
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:41,495
I've got something to tell you,
but don't get mad.

277
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:48,935
I didn't go to summer camp,
I'm in the Alentejo with grandad.

278
00:45:50,023 --> 00:45:52,491
Paulo, what's going on?

279
00:45:54,823 --> 00:45:57,621
Yes, he's looking after me.

280
00:45:57,703 --> 00:46:00,695
Let me speak to him, now!

281
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:05,658
Mom, I saw the house
you lived in with dad.

282
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:09,019
Paulo, pass the 'phone over,
do you hear me?!

283
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:13,775
She wants to speak to you.

284
00:46:15,462 --> 00:46:16,133
Hello?

285
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:17,819
Hi.

286
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:23,256
No, l... I even put him on the bus,
but he got off.

287
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:29,892
All right, see you tomorrow.

288
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,338
Just a minute.

289
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,330
Did you really get the car going?

290
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:57,528
See?

291
00:46:57,819 --> 00:46:59,810
Let me try.

292
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:01,538
Go on.

293
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:11,972
How did you do that?

294
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:15,136
Go on, in the back,
no one sits there.

295
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:42,089
Look, grandad, look who it is.

296
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:43,535
It's you!

297
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:46,805
You're making it all change.

298
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:49,685
I never wanted it to be like this,
never!

299
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:53,809
- Oh grandpa, I want to see him!
- No, Paulo, it won't help!

300
00:47:53,856 --> 00:47:55,733
But he's my dad!

301
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:24,250
I'm glad we've arrived!

302
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,643
Come on in!

303
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,723
Carlos, come with me.
Excuse us.

304
00:49:44,729 --> 00:49:46,685
I was starving!

305
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:53,600
- You won't get married before the harvest?
- We haven't thought about it yet.

306
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:56,407
For the love of god, get a move on!
I don't want an illegitimate grandson!

307
00:49:56,408 --> 00:50:00,447
You know we want to go to Lisbon
and I thought you could help us.

308
00:50:00,448 --> 00:50:04,157
- Just until I get a job.
- What's this nonsense?

309
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:07,558
Haven't you got a job here? And land?
And a house? You're having me on!

310
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:09,883
Why will you only help me
if I do what you want?

311
00:50:09,928 --> 00:50:12,157
I'm the only one who makes
you see sense, that's why!

312
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:15,517
Do I have to spell it out? I want
to be me! Not an extension of you!

313
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,558
No way! No way!

314
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:20,885
I'll only help you if you'll stay here
on this land that belongs to you!

315
00:50:20,927 --> 00:50:24,363
If you don't,
you can count on me for nothing!

316
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:44,161
Dad's becoming impossible,
he's getting more and more pig-headed.

317
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:47,964
Calm down, we'll decide what to do
when the baby's born!

318
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:51,924
How you manage to stay so calm?
What's your the secret?

319
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,804
It's very simple.
I think of some names.

320
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:59,003
Joana, Filipa, Hugo,
João, Diogo, André.

321
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:02,195
If you say them fast enough, it sounds
like a lullaby. Do you want to hear?

322
00:51:02,244 --> 00:51:06,954
Joana, Filipa, Hugo,
João, Diogo and André...

323
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:08,843
If it's a boy
I want to call him Paulo.

324
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:13,315
- How come you get to choose the name?
- Because I'm the man!

325
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:17,637
I'd like to see a man
carry this around for nine months!

326
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:21,754
Joana, Filipa, Hugo,
João, Diogo and André...

327
00:52:51,158 --> 00:52:52,147
Hello?

328
00:52:52,598 --> 00:52:53,633
Mom!

329
00:52:55,558 --> 00:52:57,276
Half past ten?

330
00:52:58,118 --> 00:52:59,345
Yes...

331
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,196
Okay...

332
00:53:02,837 --> 00:53:04,270
See you...

333
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:08,915
Do you want to go and fetch her?
Or shall we ask Francisco?

334
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:11,192
Ask Francisco, that's best.

335
00:53:57,354 --> 00:53:58,503
Francisco?

336
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,832
Where's Paulo?

337
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:06,391
Paulo's waiting back at the house.
Mr. Salgado sent me to pick you up.

338
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,549
- How is he?
- He's fine.

339
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:39,140
Mom!

340
00:54:44,111 --> 00:54:48,070
Hello, my angel!
I've been so worried about you.

341
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:51,660
- I'm fine, mom.
- I've missed you so much.

342
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:53,784
Hello, Teresa.

343
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:58,380
Look at you...
you haven't changed a bit.

344
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,219
Hello, Irene.

345
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,661
Paulo's been very good.

346
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,109
It's lovely having a child
around the place.

347
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:10,908
It's done Mr. Salgado good, too.

348
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,339
Mom, I saw the house
you and dad lived in together!

349
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:17,745
And you know,
grandad's got a magic car!

350
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:19,268
A what?

351
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,144
Where's grandad, Irene?

352
00:55:22,189 --> 00:55:24,148
He must be in the study,
he'll be out shortly.

353
00:55:24,149 --> 00:55:27,141
Let's go in...
Can I get you anything?

354
00:55:27,189 --> 00:55:29,099
Yes, yes, thank you.

355
00:55:38,948 --> 00:55:40,222
Mom's here!

356
00:55:43,228 --> 00:55:45,219
Hello, how are you?

357
00:55:46,187 --> 00:55:48,143
Very well, thank you.

358
00:55:48,227 --> 00:55:52,061
Would you like some coffee,
I've just made it?

359
00:55:58,987 --> 00:55:59,897
Mom...

360
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:03,620
I stuck the labels on,
just for you.

361
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,145
By yourself?

362
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:11,455
- Why don't you have it at dinner?
- Not for me, I don't like wine. Here...

363
00:56:11,866 --> 00:56:13,458
I have a present for you.

364
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:18,984
Thank you.

365
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:27,981
Not here Paulo, outside.

366
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:47,336
I know that...

367
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:49,700
You know that what?

368
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:56,531
I should have told you straight
away that Paulo was here, but...

369
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,493
But what?

370
00:57:00,423 --> 00:57:01,776
But I...

371
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,859
I was knocked out.

372
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:12,257
I've been a grandfather
for the last ten years...

373
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,617
But the fact is...

374
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:21,141
... I never behaved like one.

375
00:57:41,101 --> 00:57:42,419
Sit here.

376
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,371
We need to talk.

377
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,333
I've always trusted you...
you lied to me.

378
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,938
I'm sorry, mom.

379
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,772
Promise you won't lie to me again.

380
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,972
I promise.

381
00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:08,175
- I've missed you.
- Me too, mom.

382
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:13,010
Let me show you round.

383
00:58:46,017 --> 00:58:48,167
This is the magic car.

384
00:58:48,217 --> 00:58:51,652
- I can't believe he kept this car!
- What is it, mom?

385
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:52,572
Nothing.

386
00:58:57,616 --> 00:59:01,211
Come on,
perhaps you can go with us.

387
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:09,526
I don't want you to get
in this car ever, do you hear?

388
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:18,774
What's going on?
What's the matter with you?

389
00:59:18,815 --> 00:59:19,645
Mom...

390
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:24,049
I saw dad when I was in this car.

391
00:59:24,134 --> 00:59:27,570
I don't know what you've
been filling his head with,

392
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:30,043
but this is the last time
you'll see my son!

393
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:34,167
Teresa... it's all in his imagination.
The car broke down ages ago...

394
00:59:34,214 --> 00:59:37,650
Have you at least
told him what you did?

395
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:45,212
Don't you think if I could have
changed all this, I would have done?

396
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:48,723
I was right
to keep Paulo away from you.

397
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:53,852
Joana, Filipa, Hugo,
João, Diogo and André,

398
00:59:53,853 --> 00:59:58,926
Joana, Filipa, Hugo,
João, Diogo and André...

399
00:59:58,972 --> 01:00:03,966
If you say them fast enough,
it sounds like a lullaby.

400
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,729
How did you...?!

401
01:00:08,252 --> 01:00:11,050
Only your father and I knew...

402
01:00:11,372 --> 01:00:13,521
Now do you believe me?

403
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:25,206
This was the day you were born.

404
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:27,921
Are my mom and dad inside?

405
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:30,486
No.

406
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:36,518
Just your mother.

407
01:01:55,565 --> 01:02:00,275
- This is it! I'm scared, Irene!
- Everything's fine, it'll be all right.

408
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,555
Where is he when I need him?

409
01:02:03,405 --> 01:02:06,044
- Carlos!
- We have to go!

410
01:02:07,645 --> 01:02:11,956
Tell Miguel to go and get him!
I need him here with me, now!

411
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:27,833
Mr. Salgado, there's no point
hanging around here worrying.

412
01:02:27,883 --> 01:02:31,239
Teresa just wants Carlos here
with her.

413
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:33,841
But is she...

414
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:37,157
- All right?
- Yes, she's fine!

415
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:40,036
Don't think about
what happened to your wife!

416
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:43,918
It's not that, it's...

417
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,081
I get nervous.

418
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:49,715
They'll take care of her,
you'll see.

419
01:02:55,002 --> 01:02:57,152
Go on, she's almost there,

420
01:02:57,242 --> 01:03:00,631
it'd be better if Carlos got here
before the baby's born.

421
01:04:34,516 --> 01:04:38,794
What are you doing here?
Can't you see I'm busy?

422
01:04:39,955 --> 01:04:44,904
Have you thought that right now a child
is being born in the hospital here?

423
01:04:44,995 --> 01:04:50,388
A child who happens to be yours? Is this
how you want to remember his birth?

424
01:04:50,715 --> 01:04:52,592
I'm not ready!

425
01:04:55,515 --> 01:04:58,551
Do you think any man's ready
for something like this?

426
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:02,143
Do you think when you were born,
I was ready?

427
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:51,620
Listen.

428
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:54,629
I've been thinking.

429
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:58,988
There's the old barn,
that's not being used for anything.

430
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:02,268
We could do it up for you,
make a bigger house...

431
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:06,098
More spacious,
add one or two more rooms.

432
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:10,100
You never know, might make
me a grandfather again.

433
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:12,618
How many times
do we have to go through this?!

434
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,865
We're going to Lisbon
with our son! That's final!

435
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:18,107
And what are you going to do with him?
Send him out begging?

436
01:06:28,029 --> 01:06:29,223
Grandad...

437
01:06:29,949 --> 01:06:31,348
Grandad!

438
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:32,658
Grandad!

439
01:06:35,069 --> 01:06:36,581
You're going to be fine.

440
01:06:36,668 --> 01:06:41,264
It was just a scare,
now you have to rest.

441
01:06:42,948 --> 01:06:45,667
- Look after yourself, Miguel.
- Thank you, 'bye.

442
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:55,866
- He's resting.
- Well, doctor?

443
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:58,586
It could have been
the onset of a heart attack.

444
01:06:58,627 --> 01:07:01,983
- Is that serious?
- I don't think so.

445
01:07:02,027 --> 01:07:04,063
What was he doing?

446
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:08,499
It was some foolish game
in the car with my son.

447
01:07:08,547 --> 01:07:11,344
He shouldn't drive for a while.

448
01:07:11,386 --> 01:07:15,618
Don't worry, doctor,
I'll take care of that.

449
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:16,701
Goodnight.

450
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:18,061
Goodnight.

451
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:28,814
Paulo,
the doctor says he'll be fine.

452
01:07:28,905 --> 01:07:33,137
But it's my fault,
I made all that stuff happen.

453
01:07:33,185 --> 01:07:35,824
I don't know how, but I did.

454
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:38,174
No, it wasn't you.

455
01:07:38,945 --> 01:07:43,222
There's always some reason
why things happen.

456
01:08:39,301 --> 01:08:40,256
Hi.

457
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:45,175
We're going now,
Francisco's taking us to Lisbon.

458
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,370
I know.

459
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:48,095
Goodbye, Miguel.

460
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,810
Paulo wants to talk to you.

461
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,294
Sit here.

462
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,813
I've got something for you.

463
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:11,974
- No, I can't take this, not this.
- You can drive it in bed.

464
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:15,171
I'll take it on one condition.

465
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:18,732
When I get better, I give it back.

466
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:22,533
Not that I don't like your car,
it's great!

467
01:09:23,578 --> 01:09:26,297
I'm just more used to my own.

468
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:28,892
Something else?

469
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:48,052
- Did you do this?
- No, I got it from my dad's house.

470
01:09:50,577 --> 01:09:51,896
But how?

471
01:09:52,217 --> 01:09:57,529
I don't know, I think it's because
I really wanted it to be true.

472
01:10:03,176 --> 01:10:05,815
Didn't you like my father?

473
01:10:05,936 --> 01:10:10,327
You're saying that because you
heard us arguing from the car?

474
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:15,685
Do you remember I told you once
you have to be very careful with words?

475
01:10:16,935 --> 01:10:18,414
Sometimes...

476
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:23,205
... we say things we don't mean.

477
01:10:25,015 --> 01:10:30,566
But it's so hard to take them back!
So hard, dear god! Well...!

478
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,606
Tell me something.

479
01:10:32,814 --> 01:10:35,692
That key I gave you,
the famous key.

480
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:37,332
Is it safe?

481
01:10:39,454 --> 01:10:41,331
It's safe, grandad.

482
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:53,328
'Bye, son.

483
01:10:53,653 --> 01:10:54,802
'Bye.

484
01:12:05,169 --> 01:12:06,158
Irene?

485
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:08,884
Irene?

486
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:16,637
- Are you all right?
- Yes, but...

487
01:12:16,728 --> 01:12:19,845
I need you to go to the chemist,
I've run out of these.

488
01:12:20,568 --> 01:12:22,604
Get off with you.

489
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:27,042
I don't want to leave you
on your own.

490
01:12:27,087 --> 01:12:31,285
Don't worry about that.
I'm bad, but not that bad.

491
01:12:31,327 --> 01:12:35,081
I just don't fancy another
sleepless night, that's all.

492
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:38,035
Go on!

493
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,837
- We have to go back!
- Don't be silly.

494
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:14,195
He's going to try to start
the car again, I know he is!

495
01:13:14,245 --> 01:13:17,714
- Calm down, Paulo!
- Irene hid his key.

496
01:13:19,244 --> 01:13:21,553
He took mine! Mom!

497
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,274
We'll phone Irene to check,
okay?

498
01:13:29,124 --> 01:13:30,000
Hello?

499
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:32,033
Miguel?

500
01:13:32,444 --> 01:13:34,081
Where's Irene?

501
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,521
Oh, all right.

502
01:13:37,603 --> 01:13:42,233
Well don't get out of bed.
Yes, wait, Paulo wants to speak.

503
01:13:42,363 --> 01:13:43,398
Grandad?

504
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:46,191
Are you still in bed?

505
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:50,111
What are you doing?

506
01:13:51,202 --> 01:13:53,238
All right. 'Bye.

507
01:13:53,922 --> 01:13:56,197
- He's lying!
- What?

508
01:13:56,242 --> 01:13:59,120
He can't be in bed,
he doesn't have a 'phone in his room.

509
01:13:59,162 --> 01:14:03,280
- If we wait much longer...
- He might be right.

510
01:15:54,915 --> 01:15:57,475
You never know, you might
make me a grandfather again.

511
01:15:57,515 --> 01:16:00,029
How many times
do we have to go through this?!

512
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:03,749
We're going to Lisbon with our son!
That's final!

513
01:16:04,874 --> 01:16:06,307
Did you hear what I said?

514
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:09,949
Teresa and I are going to Lisbon
with our son, whether you like it or not!

515
01:16:10,034 --> 01:16:14,949
You are my only son, I'll do what
you want, I'll stand by anything!

516
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:26,984
Miguel!

517
01:17:57,188 --> 01:18:01,738
- Well, doctor?
- All we can do is wait. Excuse me.

518
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:50,379
That's the second time today
you've washed that car.

519
01:18:54,464 --> 01:18:59,538
I should never have taken you away
from your grandfather, I'm sorry.

520
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:10,778
Mom...

521
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:14,341
Yes, my angel.

522
01:19:15,863 --> 01:19:17,979
I saw the accident.

523
01:19:18,423 --> 01:19:20,493
It wasn't anybody's fault.

524
01:19:21,303 --> 01:19:23,497
It wasn't grandad's fault.

525
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,488
Mom! Mom!

526
01:20:23,499 --> 01:20:26,059
Happy birthday, my dear

527
01:20:26,499 --> 01:20:29,695
Happy birthday to you!

528
01:20:37,378 --> 01:20:39,130
Happy birthday, angel.

529
01:20:41,498 --> 01:20:44,296
I've got a surprise for you.

530
01:20:53,697 --> 01:20:56,131
How long does it take to get to Lisbon?

531
01:20:56,177 --> 01:20:59,533
- About three hours.
- So much? When do we stop?

532
01:20:59,577 --> 01:21:03,171
- We just left! Are you fed up already?
- There's nothing to do...

533
01:21:03,216 --> 01:21:06,367
Think of something and time will fly.

534
01:21:08,616 --> 01:21:13,565
Joana, Filipa, Hugo,
João, Diogo, André...

535
01:21:19,096 --> 01:21:20,926
How do you say it?

536
01:21:20,975 --> 01:21:24,454
Joana, Filipa, Hugo,
João, Diogo, André...

537
01:21:24,455 --> 01:21:27,694
Say it fast enough
and it becomes a lullaby...

538
01:21:27,695 --> 01:21:31,449
- All together now!
- Joana, Filipa, Hugo, João, Diogo...
