00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Maryam!

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,759
Salam!

5
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,760
You want fire?

6
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
- You saw Arzu today?
- Yes.

7
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,760
- Did you take the drug kit ?
- Yes.

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,680
- You still wanna go in ?
- Of course!

9
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,159
- She asked how much?
- 50.

10
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,399
You can't get in

11
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Come back when you have
hair on your pussy.

12
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,880
I am Turkish. We
invented pussy hair...

13
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,759
Show it to me.

14
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,279
Watch out!

15
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,299
Did you see this ?
He hit me.

16
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,559
- I did not !
-You hit women?

17
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,619
He hits women!

18
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,279
Call the police. I'm in pain...

19
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,280
1-1-0. Done !

20
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Asshole!

21
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
- Tired?
- Yes, really.

22
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Watch out, asshole!
You're disabled or something?

23
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,159
- You bumped into me
- My fish is ruined.

24
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,359
Calm down!

25
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,399
Sinan, it was not on purpose.

26
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,879
He should be a little more careful!

27
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,119
Stop.

28
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,799
Tell your boyfriend to pay attention.

29
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,679
People want to work here.
Asshole!

30
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,359
Dirty fag!

31
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Sinan, your father
sells fish, eh?

32
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,560
You're Turkish.
Why not sell kebab meat?

33
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
- Shut up! Don't talk about my family.
- You should drink less.

34
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,839
Sinan, stop!

35
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,839
Stop! Calm down.

36
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,639
You're lucky he's here.
I would have smacked you !!

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Don't look at me like that!

38
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,039
You could not just shut up ?

39
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,439
Why?
You are here to protect me.

40
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm not always here.

41
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,919
(song lyrics) You must fully understand

42
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,399
No, I must not !!

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,759
You must adapt yourself

44
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,599
No, I must not !!

45
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,479
You have to march with us

46
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,119
No, I must not !!

47
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,120
All I have to do
is sleep, drink, breathe, fuck !!

48
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
And live by my own rules

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,520
All I have to do
is sleep, drink, breathe, fuck !!

50
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
And eat a hamburger
at 4 o'clock in the morning

51
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Careful !

52
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,879
Get lost !

53
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,680
Don't you wanna go to the hospital ?

54
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Spread your legs!

55
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Push !!

56
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Maryam !

57
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Stop!

58
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Police! Stop!

59
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Do not move!

60
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,779
Leave him alone !

61
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,459
I'm a cop.

62
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,960
Shut up !

63
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,160
Police.

64
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Maryam ?

65
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
It's me. Open the door !

66
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,559
Did you have one too many tonight ?

67
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Shut up, you dirty Gypsy! Shut up!

68
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,279
I told you to shut up, asshole!

69
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,819
Go home !

70
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,520
Tell your whore mother
to go home !

71
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,139
Bitch!

72
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,840
Your mother is a bitch !

73
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,479
You OK ?

74
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,359
I don't think he was Gypsy.

75
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,559
He's still an idiot.

76
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Are you gonna be fine ?

77
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Well, we'll take a taxi.

78
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,320
What are you doing?

79
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,919
No!

80
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,599
Stop!

81
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Want to take it with you?

82
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,439
How long have you been
in Germany?

83
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,599
35 years

84
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,399
Ah! You come from Nigeria.

85
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Yes, but we've been here 8 years now

86
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,719
Can I see your papers please ?

87
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Well. You can leave.

88
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Idiot! Idiots!
I doesn't matter where you live !

89
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,680
In my country or yours,
it is always the police.

90
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,399
Speak German !

91
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,639
Rainer!

92
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
If their papers are in order,
let them go. She's right.

93
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Your papers have expired....

94
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Everything is OK.
You can go now

95
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
You may leave !

96
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
<i><b>Al Salat - Devotion - Prayer</b></i>

97
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,399
Good morning.

98
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Come on, put your jacket on.

99
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,679
- What time is it?
- 9:30 am.

100
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
I have to go to work.
I'll take him to school.

101
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,840
You sleep in the living room now?

102
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Kinay, go put your shoes on

103
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Listen.

104
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I saw her again

105
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,439
Whom ?

106
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Leyla Imamovic.

107
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
A routine police check for
illegal foreigners....

108
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Her papers had expired.
I let her go.

109
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,319
You what?

110
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I let her go.

111
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,979
Don't worry.
Nobody has seen anything.

112
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,079
But why?

113
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,959
Why did you do that?
You do not owe her anything.

114
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,960
- It's not that.
- What then?

115
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,320
I do not want to relive that.
I cannot stand it.

116
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
We finally have managed...

117
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
...to have a normal life.

118
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,479
Yes.

119
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,039
You're right.

120
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,519
I just wanted to tell you.

121
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,519
It happened.

122
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,279
It will not happen again.

123
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,479
It's over !!

124
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,119
Mom?

125
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
I promise....

126
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Missed.

127
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Try to focus more on the left.

128
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,279
Is everything okay?

129
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,280
This is not your day, eh?

130
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
You're right, it's not my day.

131
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Bull's eye !!

132
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Daniel, why are you still here ?
Don't you have school later ?

133
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Yes, this is life and
life is my school !

134
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
What do you know about life?
Come and help my Sammi

135
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,220
Let Daniel do that ! This is not halal
(halal=Moslem dietary laws)

136
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,719
Do you really want to come tomorrow ?

137
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,239
Don't you want me to ?

138
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,119
- But you have school !
- I'm interested in the mosque.

139
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Do not move!

140
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Shut up!

141
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,200
You should invite Daniel for dinner.

142
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,399
I do not know, Mom.

143
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,279
But he's a nice boy.
You should invite him.

144
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Maybe.

145
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm not sure.

146
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,599
May I interrupt ?

147
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Sammi.

148
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,268
- Salam Aleikum !
- Aleikum Assalam !

149
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,639
- How is your mother?
- Good.

150
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,919
Good.

151
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,920
This is Daniel, a friend.
He wants to attend Quran courses.

152
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Is he circumcised?

153
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,559
Well....

154
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,560
You can join us.
The course is in German.

155
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,240
You can attend
as a non-Muslim.

156
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Sinan!

157
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Could you translate this for our guest?

158
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,800
There is no god but Allah
and Muhammad is His Prophet.

159
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,399
Good !

160
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,999
This is the Shahada.

161
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,799
Our proclamation of faith.

162
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
By pronouncing the sentence
before a Muslim witness....

163
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
one becomes a Muslim.

164
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
What does that mean?
What you just recited ?

165
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Allah, make me
repentant and pure.

166
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,639
Pure? What does that mean?

167
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Being righteous, that
you act in loving your neighbor...

168
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,879
...you're honest, you ...

169
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,959
Honest?

170
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,260
Yes.

171
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,920
What does the Quran say
about people like us?

172
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
People like us?

173
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Will you be OK ?

174
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,839
(speaks turkish)
Where were you?

175
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,959
At Renan's

176
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Renan again !

177
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,439
- Papa ...
- I do not want to know.

178
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Go to bed.

179
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,199
Close my door, please !

180
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Yes, Dad.

181
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,360
- Oh no!
- Maryam !

182
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Your breakfast is ready.

183
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Dad?

184
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
You're not going to school
today?

185
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,720
The first two classes
are canceled.

186
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,760
That's why
I came home late yesterday.

187
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Do you still see doctor Olmaz?

188
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,639
Dad, it's been years !
He was my pediatrician....

189
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,039
when mom ...

190
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,040
....when mom was still alive.

191
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Your breakfast will get cold.

192
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Excuse me. Where is
the gynecology clinic?

193
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,966
End of the corridor, right,
then the elevator, 3rd floor.

194
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Is something wrong ?

195
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,879
Can I help you?

196
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Is there someone ?

197
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
- What happened?
- I had a car accident.

198
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Arzu ?

199
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Come in !

200
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,479
(in turkish)
What are you doing here?

201
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,959
I told you never to come here.

202
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,839
I was very clear.
I work here !!

203
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,840
I need you.
There is a problem.

204
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Is it out yet ?

205
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Yes.

206
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,960
You bleed, like
when you have your period?

207
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,019
- Pain and cramps?
- Yeah

208
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,079
You have the pills
I gave you?

209
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,399
- Yes.
- Take them !!

210
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,799
Yes, but ...

211
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,800
All is well, Maryam.

212
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
It does like this !

213
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,440
I cannot do anything more.

214
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Shit !

215
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,879
My God!

216
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,759
My God, make it stop!

217
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Shit!

218
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,840
<i><b>Al Zakat - Sacrifice, Offering
(from ancient Greek "Dhekati", offering
of 1/10 of one's wealth for the poor)</b></i>

219
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,959
He moaned all night

220
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
He would not eat,
nor brushing teeth.

221
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,960
I tried to call you a thousand times.

222
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,239
I thought..

223
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,240
I had to find a way
to calm him...

224
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,840
...because I was exhausted.

225
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,040
He finally ended up falling asleep.

226
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,839
I look at him, thinking...

227
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
...he is so beautiful,
I could cry.

228
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Today, there was a woman
in the Emergencies...

229
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,760
...with her baby boy
She had a car accident.

230
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,239
I could not look at her
or talk to her

231
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,799
I continued what I was doing.

232
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
I wanted to hold her hand.

233
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,960
But I was so ashamed ...

234
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,040
..because my son was
in bed, in good health.

235
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,199
And so, so beautiful.

236
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Then I got home...

237
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,119
and our son moans.....

238
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,120
He groaned and you're not there ...

239
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Where have you been?

240
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,080
It's not fair, I know.
I had a difficult day.

241
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,280
I do not know ...

242
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,480
I get ideas that
you met this woman.

243
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,480
- She needs help.
- Yes, of course she does....

244
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,520
I could help her

245
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,120
You're the last to be able to help.

246
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,159
It was me,
the guy with the gun.

247
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,299
It was an accident.

248
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,379
It was not an accident.

249
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,580
I see such things every day.
Accidents do happen !

250
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
It happened to her !!

251
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,520
I killed her child.

252
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,960
Dad?

253
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
You have awakened Kinay.

254
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,159
Go back to sleep.

255
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Go back to sleep.

256
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Who is looking for work ?

257
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,279
I need four people

258
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,799
One ..

259
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,159
two ...

260
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,119
three ...

261
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,120
four. This way.

262
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Amen.

263
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,720
- Are these dates?
- Yes.

264
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,120
-Go and get him a fork !
-No. it's ok !

265
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,840
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

266
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,280
Is this banana ?

267
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,319
Well...?

268
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,320
Not this way !

269
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Get dressed already !!

270
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Speak to her.
I'm really worried.

271
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,640
- Call her.
- Yes, I will call.

272
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,059
Yo, man. How are you?

273
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,760
- Alright ?
- Yeah man.

274
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,119
Renan, Sammi. Sammi, Renan.

275
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Samuel Jackson !

276
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,879
- This is is Daniel.
- Hi !

277
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,839
How do you know each other ?

278
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,719
- From a darkroom.
- What?

279
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,519
From work.

280
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,719
- The meat market ?
- That's it.

281
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,720
He came shortly after us.

282
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,439
I'll take a look around

283
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,639
Excuse me.

284
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,319
- A coca.
- Wine with soda

285
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Thank you.

286
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,319
My favorite song.

287
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,320
No, no! We will dance later.
We just got here

288
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Your Coke?

289
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,680
- You don't drink alcohol?
- No, I am a Muslim.

290
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,159
Yes, it's true. So am I.

291
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,639
I have to go to the bathroom.

292
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Back in a sec !

293
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Maryam, pick up !!
I must speak to you.

294
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Answer the phone, bitch!

295
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Hey, man! You follow me or what?

296
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,919
Hands off!

297
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Where is our black boyfriend,
wanker, eh?

298
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
It comes from me, this
smell of fish, or from you ?

299
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,600
It gives you a boner ? Excites you?

300
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,400
It excites you?

301
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,319
It gives you a boner ?

302
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,320
You want to touch my dick, eh?
Do you ?

303
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,239
Wanna look at it?

304
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Wanker!

305
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Sinan! Stop it !

306
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,999
What's gotten into you, man ?

307
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He pissed his pants, that queer !

308
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,999
Come here, you !

309
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,999
Daniel, it is useless.

310
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,279
It's no good.

311
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,119
Listen to me.

312
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Listen to me.
He just wants to provoke you.

313
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Calm down.

314
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,199
''We have warned you
of such punishment.

315
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
''This is the day of truth.''

316
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,599
Papa!

317
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,600
- What are you doing here?
- You have a fever

318
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,439
You should see a doctor.

319
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,440
I don't know if you will understand ...

320
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,160
It has to do with Renan ?

321
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,359
I have my period, that's all.

322
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,360
I'm sorry.

323
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,079
I just wanted ...

324
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,139
I worry for you.

325
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,719
Your mother ...

326
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,199
I do not have cancer.

327
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,800
And I'm in the hands
of God, right?

328
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,180
..... right...

329
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,880
It's always the same with Orhan.
He almost beat me ...

330
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,239
Are you leaving ?

331
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,240
We live in Germany.
I work at Starbucks ...

332
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,119
- Shall I come with you ?
- You don't have to

333
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,219
My husband came ...

334
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,639
We need a German teacher....

335
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,999
Especially for the children...

336
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
but also for other members
of our community ...

337
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,239
Hello?

338
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,240
- I do not wish to disturb you
- You don't !

339
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,639
What can we do for you?

340
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,159
May I join you?

341
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,919
Of course.

342
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,079
Thank you.

343
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,839
Sit down.

344
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,879
Speak, Cemre.

345
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,880
He almost beat me
in front of customers.

346
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,080
So I told him that ...

347
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,679
....I had my period

348
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,559
...and that it was sinful to fast
for the Ramadan

349
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,239
So, he calmed down.

350
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,740
You have sinned twice:
you ate and lied.

351
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,719
May Allah forgive me, Defne !!
It was just a glass of water.

352
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,839
He deserved the lie !

353
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,899
He's checking up on me at work....

354
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,600
...as if he has nothing
better to do.

355
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,319
Aren't you afraid that he will punish you?

356
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,119
Who ? Orhan ?

357
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,719
No, God.

358
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,720
God is so busy
with the sins of our men...

359
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,880
..that he turns a blind eye
on the women.

360
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,759
There were bedbugs.

361
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,359
And they bite....
After that, you look like a pizza.

362
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,519
She slept at her friend's....

363
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,520
There is a problem.
There is something wrong.

364
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
I think so too.

365
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,919
Your boss has no taste. Where did he
get these from ? Afghanistan?

366
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,759
I have a problem.

367
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,760
This medication ...

368
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,240
It will pass.

369
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,920
I have weird dreams.

370
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,619
- What?
- Stop!

371
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,320
- It's not right.
- You're hurting me!

372
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,319
You have made a decision !!

373
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Íot to destroy your life
and to get rid of the child.

374
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,280
And you asked me to help you.
So, no complaints!

375
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,319
What do you want?

376
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,799
Talk to you.

377
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Can we have a coffee together ?

378
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I work here and I'm
having a break right now

379
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,679
So, you have time to talk

380
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,680
I have nothing to say.
I want you to leave.

381
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,400
I talked to Renan.

382
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,280
I don't know what you mean

383
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yes you do !

384
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,680
She told me what you did.

385
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,360
You should have told me.
I could help you.

386
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,079
It does not concern you.

387
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,080
Surely it does

388
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,960
This totally destroyed me !
Do you understand?

389
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,619
I cannot eat...

390
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,920
I cannot sleep.

391
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I have nightmares.

392
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
How could you kill my child?

393
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Say something.

394
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Was it really my child?

395
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,079
- Sorry.
- Get out ! Get lost !

396
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Out!

397
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,920
My God! Make it stop!

398
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,680
My God, make it stop !
I'll do anything.....

399
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,080
I renounce evil.
Make it stop !!

400
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,980
<i><b>"Al Sawm" - Self-denial - Fasting
(the word derives from hebrew: "tzom" fasting)</b></i>

401
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,759
"God is great"

402
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,239
What?

403
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,240
The pendant..... it is written:
''God is great'' (Allahu Akbar)

404
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,320
Why did you ... ?

405
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:48,710
(Daniel calling)

406
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,760
Say something !!

407
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,200
Are you leaving ?

408
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
Gimme a kiss ?

409
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,959
Why?

410
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,960
Because I need it.

411
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Careful, it's hot.

412
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,320
- Be careful!
- It's Ramadan.

413
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,839
Yes, it is

414
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,840
Why did you tell Sinan?

415
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,439
I am worried about you

416
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,839
Everyone is worried about me.

417
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,159
- Goo see a doctor.
- I don't need to !!

418
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,199
- The pain stopped ?
- I feel fine !

419
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,000
Has the pain stopped ?

420
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,680
The bleeding ?

421
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,039
You should talk to your father.

422
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,040
Or you will talk to him ?

423
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,599
Everything happens for a reason !

424
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,600
Leave me in peace !
Do not talk about me to anyone !!

425
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Do you understand?

426
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,360
You're changing your style?

427
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,419
Why? Don't you like it ?

428
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,599
I do actually

429
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,600
The school called.
You were absent the last few days

430
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,559
I was not feeling well.

431
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,739
Feeling better now ?

432
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,759
Fasting has helped me.

433
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,760
Fasting?

434
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,360
I feel lucid, clear and pure.

435
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Hunger can make one discern
between dreams and reality.

436
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,319
Watch where you're going, man !

437
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,320
That was not Daniel's fault.
I saw you, you pushed him !

438
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Clean this now !

439
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,360
Leave me alone !

440
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,120
I said, leave me alone!

441
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Why did you do that?

442
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,959
God is testing you,

443
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,560
These are not your ideas !

444
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,440
That Daniel !!
You stay away from him !!

445
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,399
Don't let him...

446
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,399
It's not about Daniel !
It's not about God ! It's me !!

447
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,400
I don't want to hear anymore about it.
It is haram, haram !! Forbidden !!

448
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,519
- Let us pray !
- Mom !!

449
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,520
Enough!

450
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,240
Come !

451
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,320
We will pray to God...

452
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,520
and then everything will be OK !

453
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,440
''I seek refuge with Allah,
against Satan, the accursed.''

454
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Pray with me, Sammi.

455
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,680
Glad to see you again.

456
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,560
What are you doing here?

457
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,200
Stop following me.

458
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,560
ÏÊ ?

459
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,959
É'll stop !!

460
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,999
I promise

461
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,679
I'm leaving....

462
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,680
...and I will not come back

463
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Just tell me this once....

464
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,240
....that you liked it too ?

465
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,640
Can't you understand ?
Or won't you ?

466
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,059
You did like it !!

467
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,119
What we did was wrong.

468
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,719
It was simply wrong. Ok?

469
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,799
Did you like it ?

470
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,879
- It was bad.
- You liked it !

471
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,880
My religion forbids me.

472
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,599
You liked it !!

473
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,600
You liked it !!

474
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Why did you leave the mosque ?

475
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,880
I don't belong there.
I'm not like you.

476
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,320
- I cannot find ...
- But you are a Muslim !

477
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,780
I saw they were looking
for a German teacher.

478
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,859
You are a teacher....

479
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,159
I was....

480
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,160
.....for evening classes.

481
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,760
And afterwards, I met you !!

482
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,680
I like Angelina Jolie.
She takes care of poor children....

483
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,079
...even though she's a star.

484
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,399
And she's with Brad Pitt.

485
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Are you serious ?
She knows nothing about life.

486
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,959
Why ? Do you ?

487
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,600
Me, I like Khadija, the first wife
of the Prophet, peace be upon her !

488
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,680
She's a good example.
She was a business woman.

489
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,800
She married Muhammad who
was 15 years younger than her....

490
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,179
She was very modern.

491
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,080
She did not care
about people's gossip

492
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,800
What you call gossip, is important
for the community.

493
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,560
Yes, that's why everybody knows
everything about everybody else !

494
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,919
What would you do, if it was
otherwise ?

495
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,920
I could have some fun!

496
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,519
God is not interested in
your fun !

497
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,020
- You know that for sure ?
- Yes, I do !

498
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,319
God wants us to obey His laws.

499
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,679
Perhaps He does not want you
to be our guardian !!

500
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,699
Yes, He does want that !

501
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,000
He judges people by their actions.

502
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,741
Maryam, only Allah decides
which side the scale will lean !

503
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,279
This is between you and Him.

504
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,399
You have no idea what
you're talking about !

505
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,319
- And you have ?
- Yes !

506
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,320
I know the corner-stones
of Islam

507
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,360
''Whoever does not believe in God,
His Angels, His Sages, His Scriptures...

508
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,119
''And in the Judgement Day ...

509
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,120
It is up to each individual to decide
how to live his faith.

510
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,759
''... Those who wander off, far astray.''

511
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,760
It is in the Koran.

512
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,560
Maryam, wait!

513
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,839
I know I screwed up.

514
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,199
What happened?

515
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,200
I'm sorry about
what I said at the store.

516
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,639
When did you come to the store ?

517
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,479
Listen, I misbehaved

518
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,759
because ...

519
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,760
...of the story with the child....

520
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,999
What child ?
What are you talking about ?

521
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
You were right to have
the abortion

522
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,240
What are you talking about ?

523
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,639
Are you kidding me now ?

524
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,640
Be careful !
Don't tell such stories about me !

525
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,440
What stories?

526
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,280
You OK ?

527
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,119
Very few people
understand that...

528
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,120
...the Koran is a book about love.

529
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,440
But do you speak
of love or lust ?

530
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,480
I'm talking about...... a friend of mine...

531
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,439
A friend who is confused.

532
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,440
He does not know how he feels,
or whether it's good.

533
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,799
It is forbidden love ...

534
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,679
right?

535
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,799
It's wrong.

536
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,039
Allah prohibits this
kind of love....

537
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,040
because ...

538
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,080
I'm sorry.

539
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,639
Sammi, it is the Koran that says....

540
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,640
what is correct and what is wrong,
what is good and what is evil.

541
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,840
The Koran wants to guide us
and comfort us, but ...

542
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,680
it does not tell us
who we are.

543
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,519
As a friend
and not as your Imam,

544
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,520
I can say this to your friend ...

545
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,520
In the eyes of Allah,
all forms Love are good !

546
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,300
This love makes us better men than those
who still have not understood this !

547
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,479
Are you doing well with
your Koran studies ?

548
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,480
Well.

549
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,400
This is not the right direction.

550
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,880
Mecca is that way.

551
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,120
Why did you fight
with the women?

552
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,360
Everybody is talking about this

553
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,879
I already have enough
fundamentalists, as it is

554
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,880
Maybe you need more.

555
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,879
So ...

556
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,880
you are angry at me.

557
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,320
''Oh, my father ...

558
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,440
"I have received an enlightment
that has not reached you yet"

559
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,519
''Follow me and I will guide you''

560
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,279
Stop! Stop reciting verses....

561
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,759
All is well !
I am in God's hands.

562
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,760
He guides me with  steady hands
on His way.

563
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,240
You sound like an old man!

564
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,800
You don't like it that they'd rather
listen to me and not their imam !

565
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,480
Listen to you ? You speak of the girls
that you fought with ?

566
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,840
You are so tolerant that
you forgot to be a Muslim !

567
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,880
You should have done this sooner.

568
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,120
You'll get out of here when
you'll make sense again !!

569
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,240
Give me the key!

570
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I like the old Maryam better !

571
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,519
Open the door!

572
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,520
Fuck !

573
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,520
''And a third of the stars
disappear.''

574
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,160
Is it here that my bullet hit you ?

575
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Yes.

576
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,560
I'm really sorry.

577
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,240
I don't need your pity.

578
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,280
I didn't want this to happen !

579
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,200
Neither did I.....

580
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,320
The baby...
I did not want it

581
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,760
I prayed to God
to rid me of it

582
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,800
I did not want the child
of that man.

583
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,400
I did not want it inside of me

584
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,960
I did not want it
to grow up in me.

585
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,520
I prayed, begged God
to make it disappear.

586
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,719
What?

587
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,720
And then you came.

588
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,999
My dark angel.

589
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You had heard
my terrible, terrible wish....

590
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,519
Nonsense !

591
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,199
And you removed the child.

592
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,199
Nonsense !

593
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,200
Do you believe that God sent me ?

594
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,959
God has nothing to do with this !

595
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,399
Your God was just a poor,
little car thief !

596
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,439
Blasphemy!

597
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,440
That man had stolen a car stereo.
And I was chasing him....

598
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,919
Every day, I wish that
it did not happen...

599
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,920
...that I did not move
and I let him go.

600
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,160
This was an act of God !

601
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,480
God ...

602
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,239
It was a car radio...

603
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,319
..that looked like a gun !

604
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,320
He turned around...

605
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,600
And I see something shiny
in the dark. The car radio...

606
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,279
- ..shines like a gun..
- Shut up !

607
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,280
I told him to drop the gun...

608
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,839
I shoot !!

609
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,239
Shut up !

610
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,319
I shoot without thinking ...

611
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,439
- Shut up!
- I hear you scream.

612
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,440
Shut up !

613
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,840
I hear your cries every day.

614
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,200
Every day.

615
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,880
Is that why you're here ?

616
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,400
I wish I could make everything right

617
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,719
There is nothing to make right

618
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,720
I'm terribly sorry.

619
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,559
If you feel so bad...

620
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,799
...be consistent....

621
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,800
Shoot yourself !!

622
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,840
You haven't done anything that I
hadn't already asked God for !

623
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,520
God ...

624
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,600
- Shoot !
- What are you doing?

625
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,840
If indeed God sent me, then
nothing can happen ! Shoot me !

626
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,559
No.

627
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,439
Shoot  me !
If I am your dark angel, shoot !

628
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,440
- No !!
- Shoot !

629
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,640
<i><b>"Al Shahada" - Choosing a path</b></i>

630
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,480
What is Islam?

631
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,160
What is a good Muslim ?

632
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,760
When the children that I teach
or the adults that I give counsel to....

633
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,479
...ask me such questions.....

634
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,480
I always talk
of the Muslim community.

635
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,960
I think that being a good Muslim...

636
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
....it means being a good person !

637
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,480
In this great community....

638
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,400
...it pleases Allah to see....

639
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,920
... a good man,
an obedient son, a good brother,

640
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,520
...a good father that helps his child
in everyday problems....

641
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,560
...here and now....

642
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,200
...who understands the World
and the Times that his child lives in...

643
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:16,939
...a father who does not sin by 
depriving the child of possibilities....

644
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,940
....available to the child

645
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,919
For these small sins

646
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,920
Today we ask
forgiveness from Allah.

647
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,880
Let us raise our hands to heaven
and say...

648
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,639
''I have only one Lord"

649
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,759
"Allah'',

650
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,760
''And no other Lord than Allah"

651
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,959
''Allah, forgive us.''

652
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,159
And Allah will say:
''I've forgiven you''

653
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,679
That's not true !

654
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,680
God sees and punishes.

655
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,720
Do you really think that this is
so easy ? We sin and he forgives us ?

656
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,719
You lie to these people !

657
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,720
You sin before God,
if you listen to this mam.

658
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,119
God cannot stand this any longer !!

659
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,279
Don't you see the signs ?

660
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,439
The first angel sounded the trumpet already

661
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,819
- Maryam, stop.
- Hail mixed with blood !

662
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,159
Stop!

663
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,160
The second angel sounded the trumpet,
water mixed with blood.

664
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,839
Have you not seen this ?
Are you blind ?

665
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,840
The Day of Judgement is coming !
Have you not seen the plagues ?

666
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,760
The stars disappear !
A sign appeared in heaven.

667
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,800
''A woman clothed with the sun,
the moon under her feet.

668
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,720
''She is pregnant
and she cries out ...''

669
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,560
- Was she partying all night at the disco ?
- What do you know of my daughter ?

670
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,199
- Control her or....
- Or what ?

671
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,200
What?

672
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,679
For heaven's sake !

673
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,680
Have you  lost your mind ?

674
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,840
I mean ...
Surely, I hear something...

675
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,960
It's like the voice of an angel

676
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,639
who says ...

677
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,599
No, I know that
we need to change our ways !

678
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,600
God will not forgive us
if we do not change.

679
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,159
Immediately !

680
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,160
Maryam, let's pray ...

681
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,919
''In the name of Allah
the Almighty"

682
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,999
''Allah the Merciful"

683
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,919
"Allah the Merciful
forgive us.''

684
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,759
No.

685
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,760
Father, listen to me !
I'm your daughter

686
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,320
Look at you. Look at me.

687
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,760
What has befallen upon us....

688
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,920
He does forgive me !
He gives me no comfort !

689
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,959
What happened ?

690
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,960
What did you do to believe
that Allah punishes you?

691
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,200
Vedat!

692
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,240
Speak up !

693
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,720
The worst !
I did the worst thing !

694
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,480
And Allah punishes me !

695
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,840
We need to talk !

696
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,840
We need to talk !

697
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,820
- Sammi, how are you?
- Good.

698
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,179
You're on break?

699
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,080
- Yes. You too?
- Yes.

700
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,839
Let's go further down !

701
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,319
Calm down, man.

702
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,320
Hey, bro ! How are ya ?
Come join us !

703
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,360
- Sinan, leave him alone !
- Calm down. We're all friends here

704
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,560
We're all friends.

705
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,879
So, how are you ?

706
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:23,180
I hate this job. You know why
Allah does not give us any money?

707
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,020
...'cause he knows what
we'd do with that money !

708
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,520
You've got it?

709
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,759
What's that?

710
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,479
A hickey or what?

711
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,159
From your lover, huh?

712
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,160
Your lover ?

713
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,040
What is this lingering look ?
You fancy him ?

714
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,159
He likes you !

715
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,199
What are you looking at?

716
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,000
- Are you in love?
- Stop looking, man !

717
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,880
Stop looking!

718
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,939
Stop looking!

719
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,119
Fuck him, yeah !!

720
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,620
I'll make you a Muslim.

721
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,659
Recite the profession of faith.

722
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,719
And then you'll be over
with your faggoty life

723
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,320
Awesome, man!

724
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,079
Repeat after me.

725
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,080
There is no god but Allah
and Muhammad is His prophet.

726
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,120
Repeat : there is no god but Allah
and Muhammad is His prophet.

727
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,799
Go on, dirty fag ! Repeat it !

728
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,800
Say it just once !

729
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,440
Go on wanker !

730
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,159
- Faggot, speak up !
- Shut it !

731
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,160
What are you doing, man ?
You have him pinned down !

732
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,880
He's down !!

733
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,440
No! No!

734
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,079
Maryam, wait.

735
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,279
What? I want to go home !

736
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,959
I must speak to you.

737
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,499
Listen girl. It took us years

738
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,579
....to build this community.

739
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,359
We had to fight prejudices...

740
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,919
Now, it's time for us to unite

741
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,290
If you continue, you will destroy
the community of your father.

742
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,279
I do not destroy anything.
It's the community that needs help !

743
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,280
We must open the eyes of the young people.

744
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,840
You forget that young people
must respect their elders.

745
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,439
Our parents want us
to obey them

746
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,440
But their lives and their faith
are false.

747
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,679
My dad
is the best example.

748
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,680
Ather the death of my mother,
he left me do as I please...

749
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,719
It's all his fault!

750
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,679
How can you say that
about your father ?

751
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,279
The Quran says:

752
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,280
"If they force you to associate yourself
with what you do not know...."

753
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,539
''Obey them not''

754
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,240
My child, it takes a lifetime
to understand the Koran.

755
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,319
Leave me alone.

756
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,320
Swear to Allah that you will stop !

757
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,080
My daughter !

758
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,760
What happened?

759
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,640
(in turkish)
Your children

760
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,120
are not your children

761
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,160
They are the son and daughters

762
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,640
of your desire for life

763
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,360
They come through you,
but not from you

764
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,360
And though they are with you

765
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,560
they do not belong to you

766
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,640
You can give them

767
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,520
only your love

768
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,960
but not your thoughts

769
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,320
We found in the handbag of your daughter
the pamphlet of a drug....

770
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,960
...that is used to terminate a pregnancy

771
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:07,760
Your daughter had an illegal abortion

772
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,680
She should had come to us to receive
immediate care

773
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,640
She's almost empty of blood.

774
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,639
All is well, my child.

775
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,640
All is well.

776
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,600
Can't you sleep either ?

777
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,680
You know what helps me?

778
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,880
Praying, 'cause it's so boring!
Shall I try ?

779
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,479
''I'm tired, I go to bed.

780
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,879
''And soon, my eyes are closed.

781
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,880
''Father, I beg you,
watch over my sleep"

782
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,840
"If I have misbehaved today,
please don't hold it against me"

783
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,600
''Your goodness makes us stronger
and repairs all the damage"

784
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,560
''Please protect all those
that are dear to me"

785
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,560
''All people, young or old
must obey your Laws"

786
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,240
"Let the sick hearts rest"

787
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,479
''Close our tired eyes"

788
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,680
''Let the moon, from heaven,
shine over the silent world''

789
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,240
Good night, Dad.
