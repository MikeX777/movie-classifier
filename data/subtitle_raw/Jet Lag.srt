1
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,944
Did I ever get slapped!

2
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:33,992
They caught me coming out of
Roman Holiday at a Left Bank cinema.

3
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:39,414
Not only did I skip school,
but American movies were off-limits.

4
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:45,462
Dad found them silly and Mom said
they weren't true to life.

5
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,424
Okay, the poor get rich,
the rich have problems,

6
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,969
immigrants are legalized, wars end,

7
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,723
even the dead come back,
and whores marry millionaires.

8
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,391
If only it could all be true!

9
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,313
Andy Warhol said...
- Say, another American! -

10
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:10,320
that everyone should be famous
for 15 minutes in his life.

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,240
always felt I had a right
to a whole day.

12
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,953
A whole day when my life
would be like an American movie.

13
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,227
Why are we landing in Paris?

14
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,907
JET LAG

15
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,364
I'm calling from Paris.

16
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,283
Nothing, I'm not staying here.

17
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:07,497
Besides, it's a madhouse as usual:
strikes, school vacation...

18
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,251
I'm going to Munich,
but the weather's bad.

19
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,422
No, it wasn't planned.
Nadia's grandmother died.

20
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,844
That's beside the point.
I was fond of her grandma.

21
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,236
Departure times are undetermined.

22
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:45,243
You must have some idea when.

23
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,662
Not with the strike.

24
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,291
- What strike?
- Public utilities,

25
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,627
now the air-traffic controllers.
It's vacation!

26
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,381
French Rail is joining in.

27
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,050
Aisle or window?

28
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,388
The trains are on strike, too?

29
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,057
No aisle seats.

30
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,810
It's a disaster!

31
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,275
- Or in the last row.
- A window's fine.

32
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,569
The trains, you sure?

33
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,242
Your ticket and baggage check.

34
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,845
Hang on.

35
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,855
You still there?

36
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:02,320
C'mon, it's not that far!
I'll pay your cab fare to mother's.

37
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,282
Have the taxi wait, go upstairs.

38
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,202
The letter's on the nightstand.

39
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,624
By the phone,
an envelope marked Sergio.

40
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,877
Take it and run.

41
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,380
You have the door code?

42
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,091
Write it down:

43
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,428
36 B 48. Can you hear me?

44
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,141
No, B as in...

45
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,149
Oh, shit!

46
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:46,656
This can't be happening.

47
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,927
Be tough.
Gloria McKornick will be there.

48
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,098
No, the pain-in-the-ass
"food engineer."

49
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,852
The one who killed
our Shepherd's Pie...

50
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,857
She's a menace.
All she likes is Chicken Bechamel.

51
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,611
And Bruno,
it's uptown this time.

52
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,113
On their turf, not ours.

53
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,500
Would you mind?
Just for a local call.

54
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,671
I lost mine
and the phone booths are all...

55
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,882
It's really urgent.
You don't mind?

56
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,552
Write this down: 36 B 48.

57
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,681
Right, B as in Bernard.

58
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,643
Sure, she'll give them to you.

59
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,814
No, you know how she is.
I'm not up to calling her now.

60
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:08,279
Whatever! That you're borrowing
a dress, my leg waxer...

61
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,743
Do it now. Promise! With the strike
he'll come home and find the letter.

62
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,331
I let it all out. I say goodbye...

63
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,668
Stop it! I'm with...

64
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,464
I'm not scared, but if he shows up
here, I'm afraid I might...

65
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,635
I'm stuck, everything's held up.

66
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:35,432
There are no planes taking off.
Hurry!

67
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,416
There's coffee. Care for a coffee?

68
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,004
Mind if I have a coffee?

69
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,758
- My cell phone?
- Sorry.

70
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,303
Not even a glass of water?

71
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,312
Are you Rose? It's for you.

72
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,815
Sorry,
the number must've registered.

73
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,859
I'll just be a minute.

74
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,570
Mom?

75
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,910
How'd you get the number?
She shouldn't have.

76
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,498
I'm not at the beauty parlor today.
I'll explain later.

77
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,712
You didn't do that?!

78
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,006
How many did you take?

79
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,759
How many are left? The box was full?

80
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,973
Then it's not too serious.

81
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,812
No, nothing else! Not even aspirin.
You'll sleep tonight.

82
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,111
I can't right now.

83
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:59,159
I can't come over now.
Not today, Mom.

84
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,912
No little massage today.

85
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,209
Sure, I love you.

86
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,340
Give my key to Sabine.

87
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,844
Of course

88
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:24,726
I'm still your little girl.
Wherever I am, wherever you are.

89
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,191
Of course. Lots of love...

90
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,412
That was really sweet of you.

91
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,955
Are you okay?

92
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,957
What's wrong?

93
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,005
In my bag. There.

94
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,758
The pills in my bag.

95
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,721
You'll be all right.

96
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,731
- A problem?
- I don't know.

97
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,484
Sit down.

98
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,821
I'll call a doctor.

99
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,200
I'll massage you, it'll help.
Just relax.

100
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,494
Don't touch me.

101
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,665
- You taking a plane?
- I hope so.

102
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,836
Stop by the drugstore.

103
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,713
It's a sedative.

104
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,215
Only if the symptoms recur.

105
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,509
You mean if my heart beats fast?

106
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,637
- Not fast, hard.
- There a difference?

107
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,557
Fast is here. Hard is here.

108
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,268
Think I enjoy fainting?

109
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,979
Relax. There's no physical disorder.

110
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,108
If you feel faint, put your feet up.

111
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,622
- Feeling better?
- Fine, just fine.

112
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,461
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

113
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,589
I wanted to return your...

114
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,551
If I can do anything...

115
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,054
Everything's fine, thanks.

116
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,685
- Goodbye.
- I wanted to tell you...

117
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:17,524
Go easy on those pills.
It's habit-forming and...

118
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,986
And... while you were...

119
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,908
No, nothing.

120
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,285
Goodbye.

121
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,352
Nadia!

122
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,606
What message?

123
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,154
No, I didn't get any messages.

124
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,870
Hang on, someone's trying to call.

125
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,167
Sabine who?

126
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,586
Rose who?

127
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,382
No, Rose isn't here!

128
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,345
I don't know. How should l?

129
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,138
What?

130
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,015
Repeat that.

131
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,101
Sergio? Who's Sergio?

132
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,611
I've had enough. I can't help you.
I'm taking a plane.

133
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,905
I'm sorry, but...

134
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,241
That's right, goodbye, ma'am.

135
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:53,138
- It's tiring. I'm stressed out.
- Are you?

136
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,723
You have to understand me.

137
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,434
We'll take a vacation.

138
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,437
We need a month off together.

139
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,399
Wherever you want.
You decide where.

140
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,276
I put in for vacation.

141
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,200
It's just to say, Sergio's
on his way. Apparently in a rage,

142
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,703
out of control.

143
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,622
Your friend said to warn you.
Sabine...

144
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,291
That her name?

145
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,462
I think she ran into him
at your place.

146
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,424
She says he's dangerous.

147
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,431
Meet Sergio.

148
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,735
I'm sorry, I don't...

149
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,280
Felix. Felix Doumergue.

150
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,996
This'll teach me a lesson.

151
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,750
- Sorry, that was dumb of me.
- Who's he?

152
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,712
Nobody. Tell him.

153
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,215
We're total strangers.

154
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,968
Sit down, have a drink.

155
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,808
Sit down!

156
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,154
What'll it be?

157
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,282
Lemon soda.

158
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,373
- Let me explain...
- Don't bother.

159
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,375
Let him!

160
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,837
I have a flight, sorry.

161
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,134
I'll explain, then.

162
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,309
See this woman? Look at her.

163
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:11,234
At first glance she's not bad:
dressed up, perfumed, a real doll.

164
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,319
I'll come home, Sergio.

165
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,654
Shut up, bitch!

166
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,367
You don't know her? Let me tell you.

167
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,787
She's a bitch. A slut.

168
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,249
A rotten liar, a chicken.

169
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,917
You're pathetic.

170
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,546
And that bitch, your friend Sabine,

171
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,174
always butting in.

172
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,676
What crap did you tell her?

173
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,430
Stop it! I said I'd come home.

174
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,184
Sure, you will!
You never had the balls to split.

175
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,435
Listen...

176
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,228
You'll see.

177
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:52,942
The best day of my life
is when I had you abort.

178
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,445
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

179
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:00,992
Fuck off, bitch! I'd croak
before I'd have your child.

180
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,703
Scram, you lousy slut!

181
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,291
My God! Are you hurt?

182
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,796
Beat it. What're you doing?

183
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,771
Here. You're bleeding.

184
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,749
We back in Paris?

185
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,252
You never left, sir.

186
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:01,006
A computer failure.
All planes are grounded.

187
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:05,802
First class passengers
are being put up at the Hilton.

188
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,595
Duck a l'orange is different!

189
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:16,229
Shepherd's Pie needs foil containers.
I told you a hundred times.

190
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:22,068
Did you get Marsha Lipton? Insist!
She's a star in the mid-west.

191
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:27,073
No, I can't get out
of this goddam country.

192
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:32,078
Nothing works here:
planes, trains, computers...

193
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:36,041
Except sleeping pills.
And vacations.

194
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:42,297
They're overtaxed, unemployed,
at war... And they go on vacation!

195
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,342
I'm spending the night.

196
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,218
Call you tomorrow.

197
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,347
I don't know.
I gotta be in Munich by 3.

198
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,432
No, 3 p.m.

199
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,399
Care for some?

200
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,402
No, thanks.

201
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,407
- A Schoolboy?
- A what?

202
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,495
A chocolate-covered cookie.

203
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,997
No, thanks.

204
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,964
I wanted to thank you.
If it weren't for you...

205
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,342
No, I never should have...

206
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,135
No, honestly.

207
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,809
You're still here, too?
Is it a problem?

208
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,686
I mean, is your trip urgent?

209
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,397
Sure is.

210
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:48,113
Because for me right now,
an hour more or less...

211
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,957
While you were in the infirmary...

212
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:03,962
American Airways passengers
for Munich.

213
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,256
Your bus is here.

214
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,218
Goodbye, then.

215
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,419
I have a room at the Hilton.

216
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,841
There must be two beds.
You'd be more comfortable than here.

217
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,685
Forget it.

218
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:04,022
No, it's very...

219
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,816
nice of you.

220
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:13,198
True, a real bed would be...

221
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,177
Prefer the window?

222
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,680
This side's fine.

223
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,599
I prefer near the door.

224
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,267
Okay by me.

225
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:55,448
Smells drive me...
Especially stale smoke.

226
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,661
Do you smoke?

227
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,169
Hungry?

228
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,265
You can take off your coat.

229
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,697
Mister, can you hear me?

230
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,825
Are you okay?

231
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,167
Oh, my God!

232
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,755
I'm fine. I fell asleep, that's all.

233
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,466
- Did I hurt you?
- I was asleep.

234
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,718
- On the floor?
- Yes, on the floor.

235
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,139
Maybe it's those pills.
Did you take more?

236
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:52,102
I know all about them.
A relative of mine...

237
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:56,898
It's jet lag. I don't even know
the time. And my pressure...

238
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,609
- Your what?
- My blood pressure.

239
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,486
- Your blood tension!
- That's it.

240
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,363
I haven't had lunch.

241
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:06,491
Dinner. Me neither.

242
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,494
What do you want?

243
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,539
Nothing, really.

244
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,877
Artichoke salad. Are they fresh?

245
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:23,299
Then tomato salad and ham.
Is it fresh cut?

246
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,722
A chicken breast, then.
Only drumsticks?

247
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,475
Then ham it is. And French bread.

248
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:36,229
Not cut, nice and crisp.
How about you?

249
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,940
- Honestly, no.
- Make it for two.

250
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,860
In that case I'd prefer...

251
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,528
Hang on.

252
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,784
"Hare and venison terrine
with pistachios,

253
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:55,623
"with a pepper mousse and feathered
endives with nuts and Roquefort..."

254
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,794
A hare terrine.
Vinaigrette on the side.

255
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,922
And fruit.
Not a cocktail, just fruit.

256
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:07,927
In whatever you like.
A basket, fine!

257
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,681
And a Calon-Segur... '96.

258
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,312
Everything's so complicated
in this country.

259
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,483
Aren't you hot?

260
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,402
I was cold earlier.

261
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,365
No wonder... there's no air.

262
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:34,537
- Just a few minutes.
- Aren't you a bit claustrophobic?

263
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,917
It's strong.
What is it, your perfume?

264
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:43,922
Maybe I put too much on.
It's my own blend, with jasmin...

265
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,552
I'll wash my hands.
If you don't mind.

266
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:52,263
Because I'm somewhat allergic.

267
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,656
...bad weather conditions
all over Europe.

268
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,909
In addition to this,

269
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:16,037
the situation is aggravated
by several strikes.

270
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:19,290
At Paris airports,
a million travelers

271
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,459
are stranded
by an air controller's strike.

272
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,796
I thanked you because

273
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:28,341
without you,

274
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,052
I'd have gone back with him.

275
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:41,479
I'd have gone back with him
if you hadn't arrived.

276
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:47,444
At the cafeteria,
I'd have fallen for it once again.

277
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:52,240
It's none of my business.

278
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:08,506
I just emailed you.
You get Marsha Lipton?

279
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,426
Why won't she do the show?

280
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:15,805
What a bitch! Typical anal American!

281
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,476
She's right about TV.
With her hairdo

282
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:23,313
and beady eyes,
she's more fit for radio.

283
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,941
I'm not sleeping.
Call when you like.

284
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,195
I'm wide awake, in fact.

285
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:12,028
- You in the restaurant business?
- Sort of.

286
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,948
You're a chef?

287
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,536
I used to be.
Now I run a frozen foods company.

288
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:27,043
I travel a lot, I do consulting,
because we belong to a larger firm...

289
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,920
Anyway...

290
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,214
You're not too sure what you do.

291
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:36,428
I'm just saying that
because lots of people...

292
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:41,433
They're so stressed out,
they forget what they do.

293
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,063
And what do you do?

294
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,109
It's a little complicated.

295
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,113
I'm doing a season...

296
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:59,367
We don't have to talk. I have work
to do. Maybe you do, too.

297
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,623
My line of work takes two.

298
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,548
You asked, I'm telling you:

299
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:16,593
I'm a beautician.

300
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:23,933
Makeup, massage, waxing,
facials, reflexology...

301
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,437
What's that?

302
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,774
Feet. Points on your feet
match an organ...

303
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:35,570
It'll take Mr. Clean
to get all that off.

304
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,907
My makeup?

305
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:45,997
For me it's like clothing.
I feel naked without it.

306
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,959
A quirk of the trade, I suppose.

307
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,671
Once again I'm meddling.

308
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:57,050
No, on the contrary,
if we don't get involved

309
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,515
in other people's lives...
we end up very lonely. Don't we?

310
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,106
It's you!

311
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,819
"Fine cuisine."

312
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:20,073
Pronounce it the French way, or...

313
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:21,866
It doesn't rhyme?

314
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,786
It's mainly for marketing.
It sounds...

315
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,955
- French.
- And diet-like.

316
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,834
Not for Americans,
they don't understand.

317
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:35,630
But they figure
it's the gourmet-medical trend.

318
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,507
Is it good?

319
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:39,801
It's the latest. It's brand new.

320
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,138
It'll be presented
in stores next week.

321
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:45,640
Plus TV and the web.

322
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,643
- So that's it.
- That's what?

323
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,939
Why you're so nervous. Your fits...

324
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,612
- Look, Sabine...
- Rose... But I talk too much.

325
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,788
Just a few minutes!
Do you mind?

326
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:16,504
The Popular Front is on the march.

327
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:20,884
Step one:
the two main union federations,

328
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:26,097
the CGT and the CGTU,
merge at the Congress of Toulouse.

329
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:31,603
Daladier and the Radical Party

330
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,022
join the popular movement.

331
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,466
Had enough?

332
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:05,845
I could watch for hours.
I love history.

333
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,933
My parents are communists.

334
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,860
Come in!

335
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,496
Sit down.

336
00:39:40,505 --> 00:39:42,549
No, we'll split it.

337
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,843
Forget it.

338
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:15,206
Been living abroad a long time?

339
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,917
Is it so obvious?

340
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:21,046
You don't even know Schoolboys.

341
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:24,174
Yes, it's been a while.
And I don't miss it.

342
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:29,471
Lemon soda, French bread...
Isn't that being a bit nostalgic?

343
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:33,350
Not nostalgic, cautious.

344
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,226
True, people eat anything.

345
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:39,606
For instance, I don't like beef,
but I love veal.

346
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:44,611
Calves come from cows and steers.
But no one talks about veal.

347
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,990
Have any inside information on veal?

348
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:53,161
Not really, except that steers
don't sire calves.

349
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:57,123
- A steer is...
- What about it?

350
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,168
A steer is...

351
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:05,465
Of course.
Anyway, I've decided I don't care.

352
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,636
Does it scare you?

353
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:14,849
What scares me is
mediocrity mixed with complications.

354
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,311
In the kitchen, it spells disaster.

355
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:21,439
Not only in the kitchen.

356
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,442
Want some?

357
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:33,326
Your relationship with... Sergio.

358
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,037
Did it last long?

359
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:40,250
12 years.

360
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:45,213
I'd like to understand.

361
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:49,801
What goes on in the mind of a broad
who suddenly decides to take off?

362
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,849
Sergio came home today
like everyday...

363
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:00,520
He wasn't supposed to. It's
the strike. He's a train engineer.

364
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:05,150
What set it off?
Why today of all days?

365
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:10,864
I found work, a season
at "Las Brisas" hotel in Acapulco.

366
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:13,158
Overnight?

367
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,911
No, last month.

368
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,664
A month of lying.

369
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:23,585
I didn't lie, I said nothing.

370
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:26,296
For a month in bed
you pretended to...

371
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:31,217
Pretended to what? Go on, say it!

372
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:35,263
Pretended to...

373
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:39,351
Come on, have some guts. Say it!

374
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:44,856
Pretended to have orgasms?
Is that it?

375
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:47,484
It's a spicier subject than veal.

376
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:54,366
That's why you invited me.
Not for sex, or to be nice.

377
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:57,702
You're not a nice man.
If you were...

378
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,705
- I wouldn't be here.
- That's for sure.

379
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,249
Meaning?

380
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:09,381
You're right.

381
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:15,011
Let's take advantage of it.
We'll never meet again.

382
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,016
You couldn't care less
what I think of you,

383
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:24,604
and, honestly,
what you think of me...

384
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:26,898
I don't give a damn.

385
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:28,400
So go ahead.

386
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:33,822
Ask me whatever you're dying to ask.

387
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,157
Okay, then.

388
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:49,337
For a month you faked orgasms
with a man you no longer love?

389
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:53,299
Wouldn't you like to know?

390
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:55,885
You're the one...

391
00:43:56,136 --> 00:44:04,769
I'll tell you.
I've been faking orgasms

392
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,229
for a very long time

393
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:09,774
with a man I still love.

394
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:12,694
Happy now?

395
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,244
Your turn.

396
00:44:22,954 --> 00:44:23,955
Come on!

397
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:25,832
OK, then...

398
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:39,804
Besides the remote, when's the last
time you touched a sensitive spot?

399
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:43,975
8 months, almost 9.

400
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:46,061
Is it obvious?

401
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:49,189
You can't even stick
to one language.

402
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,483
I don't see what the...

403
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,402
Americans don't know Shepherd's Pie.

404
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:58,156
The French are jerks.
Pills for all occasions.

405
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:00,992
You may be a bit...

406
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:04,537
A bit what? Go on, say it.

407
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,623
You're playing dumb.

408
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:09,959
People can be multilingual, no?

409
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,922
People travel.
Things have changed since the 30s.

410
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:18,718
The web, globalization, terrorism...
ring a bell?

411
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:22,472
Well, I like smells.

412
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:25,684
Not only nice smells.

413
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:32,482
Perspiration, newsprint,
tobacco, even stale.

414
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:34,984
That's life.

415
00:45:35,443 --> 00:45:37,278
The web has no smell.

416
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,781
True, globalization's a mystery.

417
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:42,075
Going to Mexico is a start.

418
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:48,123
I don't give a damn about Mexico.
I just don't know where to go.

419
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:55,839
The empty apartment, the letter,
it's so cowardly.

420
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:00,427
It's pathetic, it's tacky.

421
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:05,849
It's not a breakup, it's a kiss-off,
a getaway. It sucks.

422
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,977
The apartment's not empty.

423
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:12,105
I left everything as it was.

424
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:17,444
This pig died for nothing.
The ham's lousy.

425
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,037
That's why I'm here.

426
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:32,876
You can't stand people,
but can't stand being alone.

427
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,669
That must be tough.

428
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:38,089
I deal with it fine.
Don't worry about me.

429
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,644
- Why the trip to Germany?
- For a funeral.

430
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:56,441
- Someone close?
- Close to someone close.

431
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:01,154
While in the infirmary...

432
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,823
What are you doing? What's that?

433
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:07,702
Vinaigrette.

434
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:12,082
On the side!
Olive oil and lemon, I said.

435
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:13,958
Sorry.

436
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:17,295
It's dripping. There's way too much!

437
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:21,675
Why didn't you say so earlier?

438
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:26,262
I didn't come here just
to have some weirdo

439
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:30,308
give me a third-degree and lectures.
Enough lectures!

440
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:35,146
You don't know what cowardice is!
So shut up!

441
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:39,192
Anyhow, I always get things wrong.

442
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:42,028
People and things.

443
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:45,490
It's cheap vinegar.
We'll make another vinaigrette.

444
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,787
I'm so sorry.

445
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:00,380
At last!

446
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:06,219
I was sick of that voice mail.

447
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:09,139
I'm still stuck in Paris.

448
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:13,101
Don't say that, Nadia.

449
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:16,021
Your grandmother meant a lot to me.

450
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:21,234
So? Three times meant a lot.
She still sent me Christmas cards,

451
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,820
and birthday cards...

452
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:28,742
You're the one twisting things!
You're erasing the past!

453
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:31,870
It's not erased! Not for me.

454
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:39,169
So it's been 9 months.
And I'm breaking down now!

455
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:40,420
That's life.

456
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,131
Oh, really?

457
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:48,678
Yes, I hear you. He'll be there?

458
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:50,305
So we'll meet.

459
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:55,477
So what if he doesn't! I came first!

460
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:59,272
I'm an ex. I exist!
An ex is a human being,

461
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:03,902
you can't blot them out,
ban them from funerals,

462
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:07,447
deny their sorrow, and all that...

463
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,243
So? I've always had anxiety attacks.

464
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,120
Yes, I'm insisting!

465
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,246
Hello?

466
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,957
Felix, you hear me?

467
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,128
I can't hear anything.

468
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:25,173
I can't hear you. Hello, Nadia?

469
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,780
The hairdryer's broken.

470
00:51:55,281 --> 00:52:01,287
I put my pantyhose on the radiator.
Once they're dry, I'll leave.

471
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:06,710
What's the matter?

472
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:08,503
You okay?

473
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:11,381
I... While you...

474
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,051
I tasted your vinaigrette.

475
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:18,763
It's good.

476
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:23,727
A very good vinaigrette.

477
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:26,938
Really?

478
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:31,234
Do you really mean it?

479
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:34,571
That's no reason to cry.

480
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,991
I cry easily,
even when I hear the Marseillaise.

481
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:41,036
Cry as much as you like.

482
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:45,415
There, I've stopped.

483
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,794
I stopped.

484
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:54,174
Kindness, even fake,
is my weak spot.

485
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:57,510
It's the last thing I need!

486
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,804
Stay natural. Ogres put me at ease.

487
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:04,601
You saw how well
I took your Mr. Clean put-down?

488
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:06,895
Yet it was pretty low.
But I was perfect.

489
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:12,942
And complexity coupled with...
what was it?

490
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:15,862
Mediocrity.

491
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,324
That was a put-down, too.
- Not at all.

492
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:24,621
It rolled right off me,
as if I didn't understand.

493
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,043
Let's turn in.

494
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:34,422
Go ahead. I won't make a sound
on my way out.

495
00:53:44,891 --> 00:53:47,477
- If this can be of use...
- I'm OK, thanks.

496
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:03,535
I broke your mirror.

497
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:06,037
I'm not superstitious.

498
00:54:21,302 --> 00:54:23,263
Do you love Nadia?

499
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:24,931
Excuse me?

500
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:28,143
- The one who called?
- It's complicated.

501
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:35,233
If you want to screw up
someone's life, you still love them.

502
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:38,069
What was that?

503
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,655
She called earlier.

504
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:42,449
She just called.

505
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,869
No, while you were at the infirmary.

506
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,914
You spoke to Nadia?

507
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:52,542
I told her
you were at the infirmary.

508
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,253
Why'd you say that?

509
00:54:55,503 --> 00:55:00,592
But you were. I wanted to
reassure her. I tried to tell you.

510
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:05,180
Who asked you to reassure her?
She was worried? What'd she say?

511
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:09,768
What's this about ruining her life?

512
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:12,270
It didn't make much sense.

513
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:18,109
You already tried ruining
her life once before.

514
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:22,697
She's better now,
she's starting a new life.

515
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:28,745
I don't think
she wants to see you.

516
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:35,126
What business is it of yours?
What would you know about all this?

517
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,504
Forget it. What do I know?

518
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:53,561
I'm lost, too.

519
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:58,983
I'm out of it, I don't know anymore.

520
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:20,588
Sorry.

521
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:23,008
No, it's good.

522
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,385
What's good?

523
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:29,556
Thaw out a little. Soften up.

524
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:33,727
Did it ever occur to you
that the duck in orange sauce

525
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:38,106
frozen and locked in its plastic bag
might be you?

526
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:41,943
I hadn't made the...

527
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:45,697
Well, as for me,

528
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:48,033
I've scored a point.

529
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:53,538
I didn't rush to comfort you.
I've scored a point.

530
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,623
Congrats.

531
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:58,960
I'm a sucker for bastards
who hurt me.

532
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:02,380
- Did I hurt you?
- It's good practice.

533
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:06,885
Was she your wife?

534
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:09,179
No, my wife was two others.

535
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,681
It's polyester. It's almost dry.

536
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:15,226
I left the first one,
the second left me. So far...

537
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:18,897
A nice balance. Is breakfast so important?

538
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,455
Is breakfast so important?

539
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,334
Nutritionally, it's the most...

540
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:42,462
It was Nadia's obsession.
In her letter...

541
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:44,756
She left me a letter, you see.

542
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,633
I figured.

543
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:50,387
A man you can't share
breakfast with."

544
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:53,306
It's my problem. Is it so bad?

545
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:55,183
If it's only that...

546
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:59,562
When I wake up in the morning,
I need silence, solitude...

547
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:05,819
The crumpled sheets, the small talk,
the knowing gazes,

548
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:10,198
the smells.
I can't handle it! I just can't.

549
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:16,454
So the fact is,
what gets it up at night,

550
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:17,914
brings it down in the morning.

551
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:25,630
I don't know what I'm saying.
I usually wouldn't use...

552
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,716
If I'd used words like that...

553
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:29,592
What if you had?

554
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:31,386
All that stuff: children,

555
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:36,266
breakfast,
major things, minor details.

556
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:42,397
When you love someone,
you don't think. You give your all.

557
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:47,652
Even if that includes
getting beaten up?

558
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:53,908
Okay, then.

559
00:58:54,784 --> 00:58:56,619
Thanks a lot.

560
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:01,624
Good luck.

561
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:15,156
Can I get a taxi?

562
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:16,616
To go where?

563
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,802
Don't bother.

564
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,362
Rue de Villiers, please...

565
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,704
- You forgot your...
- Thanks.

566
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:04,581
Where are you going?

567
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:06,875
Home.

568
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:10,420
Back to the lunatic?
To my mother's.

569
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:14,591
At your age!
Hasn't she busted your balls enough?

570
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:17,844
Get off my back! Drive, please.

571
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:19,721
Hold on!

572
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:23,683
Go on. It's your speciality:
the Stockholm Syndrome.

573
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:27,645
Haven't had your daily fix?

574
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,522
Fuck off!

575
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:35,987
Get away from me!
Mind your own business!

576
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:40,992
And your bags... Will they go
to Mexico by themselves?

577
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,927
Room 827. You still serving?

578
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,638
Not even room service...

579
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:04,349
We've tried room service.
Where's the kitchen?

580
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:08,311
You got 100,l mean 100 Euros?

581
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:13,525
There were all these crates
of parsley on the floor.

582
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:26,121
So, I'm alone in the kitchen,
it's midnight...

583
01:02:28,998 --> 01:02:29,791
Honestly...

584
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:35,005
Acapulco or the Paris suburbs...

585
01:02:36,923 --> 01:02:40,010
So it's midnight...

586
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,054
I'm alone in the kitchen.

587
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:45,849
I reduce the parsley.

588
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,059
20 crates!

589
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,645
I open the fridge.

590
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:53,356
There's cauliflower,

591
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:57,235
frogs' legs.
We always had frogs' legs.

592
01:02:57,485 --> 01:03:02,532
They were on the menu, sautéed
in garlic. I sear the cauliflower,

593
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:04,826
I sear the frogs' legs,

594
01:03:05,076 --> 01:03:08,079
roll them in the parsley sauce.

595
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:12,334
I brown the whole thing,
toss it in a casserole...

596
01:03:15,086 --> 01:03:19,632
I cover it, let it cook slowly
in the oven for an hour,

597
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:22,302
80 minutes, to be precise.

598
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,723
I taste it...

599
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,186
Amazing!

600
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:35,982
Neither nouvelle cuisine,
nor traditional. Totally original.

601
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:38,818
I went wild!

602
01:03:39,277 --> 01:03:41,529
Dad appears,
chef's hat and all.

603
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:45,408
He'd had a drink with customers.

604
01:03:45,658 --> 01:03:46,659
Not drunk,

605
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,328
never!

606
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:51,873
He comes up to me: "What's this?"

607
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:57,504
I was 17,an apprentice,
he didn't trust me with anything.

608
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:04,386
He made me study bookkeeping,
stuff I hated, even if later...

609
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,473
But I believed in myself.

610
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:11,393
I said something dumb.

611
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,978
I said, "Dad, it's a miracle!

612
01:04:14,562 --> 01:04:17,816
"It's like penicillin:
due to an error!"

613
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:21,277
Okay, it was dumb.

614
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,448
He sat down like a customer.

615
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,411
"Go ahead".

616
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:32,122
I served him.

617
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:34,624
I was petrified.

618
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:40,380
He turned to me and said:

619
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:45,468
"Too much parsley,
not enough garlic."

620
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:49,514
The jerk!

621
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:54,853
There was no garlic,
that was the point.

622
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:59,024
He didn't get it.

623
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:01,234
My frogs' legs were great!

624
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:06,865
I'd done something great
and it drove him nuts.

625
01:05:07,532 --> 01:05:11,036
Don't! Try my mignons.
It's veal, to boot!

626
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:20,837
And the frogs?

627
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:23,882
That's the star: the raw material...

628
01:05:24,924 --> 01:05:26,593
You gotta sublimate the product.

629
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:28,386
The rest is bullshit.

630
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:38,355
Hand me the sesame seeds.

631
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:43,985
When I opened my N.Y. restaurant,
the Times wrote:

632
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:45,445
"Felix

633
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:48,365
"has transcended the frog."

634
01:05:50,825 --> 01:05:52,744
You staying, you leaving?

635
01:05:53,912 --> 01:05:55,747
What's the trend?

636
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:59,000
I don't know.

637
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:04,005
In any event,
it's the first time in my life

638
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,593
no one knows where I am.

639
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:11,513
- Well?
- It makes me feel...

640
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:15,600
I feel a little...

641
01:06:16,267 --> 01:06:18,311
Like new?

642
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:20,814
A little like new, yes.

643
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,899
That balsamic?

644
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:27,070
Soy sauce.

645
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:28,947
That'll do.

646
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:38,540
You know what cowardice is?

647
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:44,379
Not daring to have
a child on one's own.

648
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:49,384
I think it's not daring
to have a child together.

649
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:59,185
Did your father ever admit
he was wrong?

650
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:04,816
I left the next day. I haven't seen
him, or my mother's grave, since.

651
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:08,778
So at 17,
straight from the Burgundy to N.Y.?

652
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:12,323
No, first I traveled around,

653
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:17,120
worked on ships,
in the Caribbean, then...

654
01:07:19,664 --> 01:07:20,874
How did you know?

655
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:23,376
Know what?

656
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:27,756
I never mentioned Burgundy.

657
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:32,469
I looked at your passport.
I didn't snoop...

658
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:35,138
That's nosy. It sucks.

659
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:42,270
I looked at yours.

660
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:49,569
When I broke your mirror.
- You're the snoop!

661
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:03,958
Does your frozen food
taste like this?

662
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:05,293
Not really.

663
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,300
Why'd you close the restaurant?

664
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:16,471
My wife screwed the maitre d',
her kids robbed the till.

665
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:20,225
- I fell out with the laundry mafia.
- That exists?

666
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:25,021
10,000 per month for protection
and clean tablecloths.

667
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:30,860
My frozen foods business
is quoted on the stock market.

668
01:08:31,736 --> 01:08:34,406
I make a lot, in dollars.

669
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:39,411
Lost a lot, too, but anyway...

670
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:44,624
What's that...

671
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:49,963
What's that gold brush in your case?

672
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:52,257
The "Golden Brush"!

673
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,844
You really did snoop.

674
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:58,304
The Nobel Prize for makeup.

675
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:01,850
There was a ceremony at the Ritz.

676
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:06,438
You're real good, then?

677
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:11,234
They didn't even come.
They thought it was a joke.

678
01:09:11,484 --> 01:09:14,571
I'm from a family of teachers.
So grim!

679
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:17,490
At home everything
was black and gray, even the TV.

680
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:20,410
So a beautician daughter...

681
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:24,164
But Rose is a name full of color.

682
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:30,420
I'm named after Rosa Luxembourg.

683
01:09:33,798 --> 01:09:36,676
One day, when I was around 10,

684
01:09:36,926 --> 01:09:39,804
I described my dream house.

685
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:44,184
Did I get slapped!
It was quite a house...

686
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:51,483
What's the matter?

687
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:56,696
No, I do know.

688
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:06,831
Without me,
would you have gone back to him?

689
01:10:06,956 --> 01:10:07,874
No.

690
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:12,045
Or maybe yes...

691
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:16,216
But I don't feel like thanking you.

692
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:20,261
I'm not asking you to.

693
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:26,434
So what was this house like?

694
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:31,856
- Mr. Doumergue? Going to Munich?
- Yes.

695
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:35,193
Your plane's leaving.
I've looked all over for you.

696
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:09,602
Well, goodbye.

697
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,984
Stay as long as you like.

698
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:53,081
Sabine, I suppose you're asleep.
Listen...

699
01:12:53,748 --> 01:12:58,712
If you kept that cell phone number...
When you get this message,

700
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:00,797
call me back at...

701
01:13:01,047 --> 01:13:06,011
01 49 19 77 77.

702
01:13:11,182 --> 01:13:15,395
This was Rose. It's 5 a.m.

703
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:19,602
This may sound...

704
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:23,314
Don't say a thing.

705
01:15:27,777 --> 01:15:30,655
Don't say a thing.

706
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:36,703
I was freaking out upstairs.

707
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:43,209
I wanted to... I don't know,
just touch you maybe once.

708
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:47,756
It's not sexual, I swear!
I don't want to sleep with you,

709
01:15:48,214 --> 01:15:50,467
- I swear!
- I believe you.

710
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:53,928
But in that room there was
such a feeling...

711
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:57,557
Such a...

712
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:03,396
Such a void. Even if it wasn't
because of you. Of that I'm sure.

713
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:05,690
I understand.

714
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:10,487
You don't miss me
and it's not me you want to...

715
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:13,073
It would be a terrible idea,
honestly.

716
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:16,659
We're both miserable.
We have nothing in common.

717
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:20,205
- We do, we're both miserable.
- True.

718
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:24,584
It's as if I were...

719
01:16:25,877 --> 01:16:27,712
Really, I don't think...

720
01:16:29,005 --> 01:16:31,257
I've only had one man.
One and a half.

721
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:34,386
Me neither. I'm not in the mood.

722
01:16:36,429 --> 01:16:38,348
We've said so much.

723
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:53,238
Oh, my God!

724
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:07,961
No, I'm still in Paris.

725
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:13,174
Because of the fog.
We almost left an hour ago...

726
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,928
I know the snow stopped in Munich.
Now it's Paris...

727
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,890
At 8 a.m. supposedly, but...

728
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:27,147
You sure?
You were so against it yesterday.

729
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:33,528
It's as if fate
were working against us.

730
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:38,533
Okay, right.
Directly at the cemetery.

731
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:41,453
See you tomorrow, I mean, later.

732
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:57,719
I don't have the key!

733
01:17:59,846 --> 01:18:01,473
Open the door.

734
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:08,563
Interesting life...

735
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:12,525
Flying all this way to bury someone
you never cared about,

736
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:17,322
to find somebody you let go
since you didn't care either.

737
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:19,407
Just great!

738
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:22,327
3 breakups and a funeral?

739
01:18:22,577 --> 01:18:25,330
Keep it up and good luck!

740
01:18:32,295 --> 01:18:35,048
Okay, I came back
because of the fog.

741
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:39,010
But if you only knew
how happy I was.

742
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:42,347
I was so glad
the plane didn't leave,

743
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:46,643
thrilled to come back here
and find you,

744
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:51,648
and your jasmine smell,
and spend two more hours with you.

745
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:54,776
We have two hours, Rose.

746
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:57,696
Let's spend them together, please.

747
01:18:58,571 --> 01:19:02,075
It's been so long since I've wanted
to spend two hours with anyone.

748
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:06,663
Even if...

749
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:08,331
Even if...?

750
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:12,085
Even if I'm dead on my feet.

751
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:16,673
Me, too.

752
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:23,114
Gate 34,that way.
Mine's not posted yet.

753
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:25,200
We have time for coffee.

754
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:27,285
You sure?

755
01:20:32,957 --> 01:20:35,835
I'll put her on. It's for you.

756
01:20:37,962 --> 01:20:41,883
Oh, the message.

757
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:45,428
I checked out.
The plane's finally leaving.

758
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,514
I'll buy the papers. Want any?

759
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:49,808
Meet you at the cafe.

760
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:53,978
It took ages,
but things are running again.

761
01:20:56,856 --> 01:20:58,983
I was wondering...

762
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:02,112
What was that house like?

763
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:08,576
A pinkish roof, blue shutters,

764
01:21:09,661 --> 01:21:11,287
a weeping willow,

765
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,833
ivy everywhere,

766
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:20,797
a linden tree. Very bourgeois,
not original at all.

767
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:29,764
Look, I have to go.

768
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,561
I'll call you when I arrive.
Lots of love.

769
01:21:55,248 --> 01:21:57,292
What would you like?

770
01:23:53,324 --> 01:23:55,368
Don't you like it?

771
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:59,330
Breakfast is a problem for me.

772
01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:03,723
Stop here.

773
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:10,605
I'll walk from here.

774
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:56,730
Could you make a sign
and write something on it?

775
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:06,448
Thank you so much.

776
01:30:28,178 --> 01:30:30,638
Rose, it's Felix...

777
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:56,474
It's Felix. Call me.

778
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:41,227
Cell phone PIN code:
1954

779
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:26,690
Rose, it's Felix.

780
01:33:27,023 --> 01:33:28,733
One night, an airport,

781
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:33,154
a man, a woman.
No, I won't be a memory, Rose.

782
01:33:33,405 --> 01:33:34,823
Fuck logic.

783
01:33:35,073 --> 01:33:38,785
So life isn't a Hollywood movie
with a happy end.

784
01:33:39,035 --> 01:33:42,330
So what if I keep
switching languages!

785
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:46,001
We have to invent our own happy end.

786
01:33:46,251 --> 01:33:48,920
Anyway, as someone said,

787
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:51,840
it all depends
on when you stop the movie.

788
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:55,176
Well, let's stop
the movie now, Rose.

789
01:33:57,929 --> 01:34:02,058
Wherever you are,
whether it's night or day,

790
01:34:02,308 --> 01:34:03,727
there must be palm trees,

791
01:34:03,977 --> 01:34:07,689
music, the sea and all that jazz.

792
01:34:08,648 --> 01:34:11,985
but I'm waiting here.
I forgot...

793
01:34:12,235 --> 01:34:14,362
I'm in Burgundy, at my father's.

794
01:34:14,612 --> 01:34:18,116
It's a house I'm sure you'll like.

795
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:23,955
Catch the next plane.

796
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:27,500
I'll be at the airport.
The place grew on me.

797
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:31,880
I'll get a room at the Hilton
and wait for every flight.

798
01:34:32,756 --> 01:34:34,174
Fuck fine cuisine.

799
01:34:35,258 --> 01:34:36,760
Oh, I almost forgot:

800
01:34:37,552 --> 01:34:39,596
I'm totally in love with you.

801
01:34:39,846 --> 01:34:43,975
I won't promise anything...
I mean, I promise you everything.

802
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:47,520
You can reach me at 04 60 01 50 10.

803
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:48,646
This is Felix.

804
01:34:48,813 --> 01:34:50,648
Call me.

805
01:35:20,011 --> 01:35:23,932
Please, sir,
back to the airport.

806
01:35:24,182 --> 01:35:26,226
The airport, please.
