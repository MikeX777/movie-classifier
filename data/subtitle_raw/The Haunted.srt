00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:36,617
Hey. Hey!

3
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,183
Can you not lie up in here?

4
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:45,382
You said on the application
form you don't smoke.

5
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:46,882
- I don't.
- For fuck's sake,

6
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:48,582
my wife will think
it's me again.

7
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:49,782
Are you smoking weed?

8
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:52,348
Look, I don't care
if you smoke.

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,150
But don't do it
in the house, all right?

10
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:55,815
You burn the place down,

11
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:58,215
and we get nothing
if the old fella dies.

12
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:00,782
You wanna smoke,
you go outside and smoke.

13
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:03,248
And none of that
funny stuff either.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,617
I said I don't smoke.

15
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,482
Look, we don't
normally hire people

16
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:13,882
if this is their first job
in care, you know.

17
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:17,448
From the look of you, I wouldn't have
thought care work was your thing.

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,817
Especially the night shift,
everybody avoids that.

19
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:21,617
I need the money.

20
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:26,651
Don't say much, do you, Emma?

21
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,517
It's Emily.

22
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:34,682
Mind you, you'd be
in good company with Mr. C.

23
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:37,582
He's not exactly talkative,
if you know what I mean.

24
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,751
Well, here we are.

25
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:12,117
Come on in.

26
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:01,317
Mister...

27
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,651
Well, if he wakes up
you tell him.

28
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,751
Here he is, our best client.

29
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,248
Hello, Mr. Cunningham.

30
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,515
You got a new girl
looking after you tonight.

31
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:23,617
Name's Emma.

32
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:25,717
See? Nothing.

33
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:27,749
Alzheimer's.

34
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,882
Guess some people
are just unlucky.

35
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:32,415
His wife died 10 years ago.

36
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,515
Brought his daughter up
single-handed.

37
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:37,448
She left for London
a couple of years ago.

38
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,582
Hasn't been back since.

39
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:42,582
When this place just
went to wreck and ruin,

40
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:47,150
he just... closed up
and turned into a hermit.

41
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:50,117
Shame. He's a lovely fella.

42
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:53,882
He's a grumpy bastard.

43
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,649
At least when he's
awake, anyway.

44
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,115
Aren't you, Arthur?

45
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,117
Well, you see
what you want to see, don't you?

46
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,515
Commode. He doesn't
have a catheter,

47
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:03,882
so he might need it.

48
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,083
Camera.

49
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,384
Your workstation
is through here.

50
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,350
It's a bit of a mess,
but what isn't in this place?

51
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:17,183
Kettle...

52
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,717
Monitor, television...

53
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,282
Telephone.
No personal calls.

54
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:25,617
We check the bills.

55
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,382
Emergency contact numbers,

56
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,784
including a 24-hour
medical helpline.

57
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:32,817
My number.

58
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,282
Don't call at night.

59
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:39,317
He dies at 5:00 a.m.
you make the call at 9:00.

60
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:44,315
All right, through here...

61
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:56,717
Cleaning utensils in here,
should you need them.

62
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:58,817
Uh, through here...

63
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,515
upstairs bedrooms
and the office,

64
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:05,784
never used now, of course.

65
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:09,384
And through here...

66
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:16,517
These shutters...

67
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,282
must be closed at all times.

68
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,450
It keeps the heat in.

69
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,484
Okay.

70
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,715
It's an old house, you know,

71
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:28,882
there's lots of creaking.
It unsettles some people.

72
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:30,215
I'll be fine.

73
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:31,551
Someone'll pick you up
at 6:00.

74
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,551
6:00.

75
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,448
All right,
let's do it then.

76
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,715
I'll drop you
at the station.

77
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:59,150
Where did you find
that little weirdo?

78
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,715
She applied for the job.
I mean, I did...

79
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:04,282
Tell her about the house?

80
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:05,749
There's nothing to tell.

81
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,250
Anyway, you ready?
I'll let her know we're off.

82
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,384
No...

83
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,117
Come on!

84
00:09:58,751 --> 00:09:59,751
Hi.

85
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,083
I'm Emily.

86
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:42,651
It's cold in here.

87
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:50,817
Are you warm enough?

88
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,083
That should be better.

89
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:01,717
Handsome guy.

90
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:37,350
You must be so lonely here.

91
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,350
Life can be unfair, can't it?

92
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,450
Yeah, I know.

93
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,117
Okay, you're okay. Shh.

94
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,050
It's all right.

95
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,417
Okay?

96
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:31,684
Is this your daughter?

97
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,250
She's a pretty girl.

98
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:48,284
Would you like me
to contact her?

99
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:55,117
Maybe I could talk to her.

100
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,551
See if she would
come and see you.

101
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:03,050
Yeah?

102
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,684
Would you like that?

103
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,150
So, Arthur...

104
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,183
where would you
keep her number?

105
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:33,083
Hello?

106
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:27,050
Oh, God.

107
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:49,217
Hello?

108
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:15,117
Arthur?

109
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:10,083
What?

110
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,115
Why aren't you in your room?

111
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:29,215
Why aren't you in your room?

112
00:35:29,217 --> 00:35:31,215
Uh, um...

113
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:33,217
- I was cleaning.
- Cleaning?

114
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,148
Yeah. Okay?

115
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,215
Okay, let's get back to bed.

116
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:40,117
- Back to bed, back to bed.
- Yeah.

117
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:42,415
Okay? Yeah?

118
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,315
Is it true? Is it true?

119
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:45,551
Is what true?

120
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:49,649
- No. Shh. It's okay.
- Jenna's always there.

121
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:52,284
- Jenna's always there.
- Let's get warm.

122
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,882
Okay, okay, um...

123
00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:57,482
- Let's get these round...
- Is it true?

124
00:35:57,484 --> 00:35:59,148
Good girl.

125
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,815
- Okay. No, no, no. Okay.
- Good girl.

126
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:06,250
Yes, that's it. Okay.

127
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,517
- Yeah.
- I hate that.

128
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,148
Stay in bed now. Okay?

129
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,181
- Stay in bed now?
- Yeah.

130
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:15,248
Yeah, nice and warm.

131
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,215
Nice and warm.

132
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,117
- Okay. Okay.
- Nice and warm.

133
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,484
What does she want?

134
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,582
What?

135
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,717
What does she want?

136
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,617
Who?

137
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:30,282
Her.

138
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:38,682
- There's...
- No, no, no...

139
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:39,782
No.

140
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,417
There's nobody else here.

141
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:44,050
It's just me and you.

142
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:37,817
Who's there?

143
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:30,784
Oh...

144
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:38,484
Oh...

145
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,450
Arthur.

146
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,384
Arthur.

147
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,484
Arthur, wake up.

148
00:43:10,484 --> 00:43:11,684
Wake up, Arthur.

149
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:16,350
Arthur, can you tell me
what you saw?

150
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:20,350
Can you tell me
what you saw at the door?

151
00:43:22,284 --> 00:43:23,484
Arthur, please.

152
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:30,584
A girl? Was it a girl?

153
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,115
Arthur.

154
00:43:35,117 --> 00:43:37,183
Arthur, tell me what you saw.

155
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,551
Who...

156
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:08,784
are...

157
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:12,751
you?

158
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:36,817
Oh!

159
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:32,617
Arthur?

160
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:50,684
Arthur?

161
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,183
Arthur?

162
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:17,549
Arthur?

163
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,248
Arthur.

164
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:26,250
Arthur, come on.

165
00:50:27,217 --> 00:50:30,415
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no, come on.

166
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:31,551
What happened?

167
00:50:32,717 --> 00:50:34,083
What happened down here?

168
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:36,515
Okay. Okay.

169
00:50:36,517 --> 00:50:38,649
No, no, no. Slowly, slowly.

170
00:50:38,651 --> 00:50:40,284
It's okay.

171
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:45,115
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

172
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:47,482
Okay, slow down. Slow down.

173
00:50:47,484 --> 00:50:49,083
Okay. Okay.

174
00:50:50,284 --> 00:50:51,782
Okay.

175
00:50:51,784 --> 00:50:53,615
Back into the bed, huh?

176
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:57,348
All right. Come on.
That's the way.

177
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,882
Okay. Okay.

178
00:50:58,884 --> 00:51:00,815
Lie down.

179
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:02,615
It's okay.

180
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:06,348
It's all right.
Breathe, breathe, breathe. Shh.

181
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,448
Arthur.

182
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,315
Listen to me! Arthur!

183
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:12,715
Arthur, it's okay.

184
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,350
Ugh!

185
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:41,150
Come on.

186
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:44,384
Hey!

187
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,782
Arthur? Arthur?

188
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:53,248
Okay, okay, okay.
It's fine now.

189
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,181
Getting back in.

190
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:58,115
Let's get you back into bed.
You're okay.

191
00:51:58,117 --> 00:51:59,382
You're okay.

192
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:02,181
All right. You're okay.

193
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:03,350
It's okay.

194
00:52:05,851 --> 00:52:07,682
Let's warm you up.
Okay?

195
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:09,651
Okay, okay. Just relax.

196
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:13,050
Shh. You're fine now.

197
00:52:13,651 --> 00:52:15,148
Okay?

198
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:21,350
Okay?

199
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,282
Arthur.

200
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:43,815
Arthur, you have to tell me
what's going on.

201
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:45,150
Arthur?

202
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,382
Huh?

203
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:53,749
Oh. It's okay. It's okay,
it's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

204
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:56,415
It's okay. I'm sorry.

205
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,715
I'm sorry. It's okay.

206
00:54:58,717 --> 00:55:02,549
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come on. Come on.

207
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,348
Come on, I've got you.

208
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,682
It's okay. It's okay.

209
00:55:06,684 --> 00:55:09,515
Let's go in here.
Hold on to me.

210
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:11,749
We're just gonna go in here.
We're gonna be safe.

211
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:14,815
We're gonna go in here
and sit down... And sit down.

212
00:55:14,817 --> 00:55:18,215
Okay. Just like this.
Come on.

213
00:55:18,217 --> 00:55:21,415
Come on. Okay, let's go
and sit over here.

214
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:23,115
Okay, come on.

215
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:26,282
It's gonna be okay.
Okay?

216
00:55:26,284 --> 00:55:28,715
Sit down for me.
Just sit down.

217
00:55:28,717 --> 00:55:31,815
Like that. It's okay.
Okay, it's okay now.

218
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:33,250
Let's put this over you.

219
00:55:33,684 --> 00:55:35,450
Okay. Okay.

220
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,749
Okay? Okay?

221
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,350
Go to sleep now.

222
00:55:42,117 --> 00:55:43,217
Go to sleep.

223
00:55:44,684 --> 00:55:47,749
Okay? I'll make it stop.

224
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:48,817
I'm sorry.

225
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,217
I'm sorry.

226
00:57:16,384 --> 00:57:17,551
By this candle...

227
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:19,784
with this charm...

228
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:27,217

238
00:59:06,284 --> 00:59:07,384
Help!

239
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,348
Leave us alone!

240
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:34,882
Leave us alone!

241
00:59:57,384 --> 00:59:59,315
Okay, okay, Arthur.

242
00:59:59,317 --> 01:00:01,482
We're gonna go for a walk, okay?

243
01:00:01,484 --> 01:00:02,849
Okay? Just come with me.

244
01:00:02,851 --> 01:00:05,582
Arthur. Arthur?

245
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:07,482
Arthur, we're just
going outside for a bit.

246
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:09,515
Get up, Arthur, please.

247
01:00:09,517 --> 01:00:11,849
Come on.
Come on, Arthur, please.

248
01:00:11,851 --> 01:00:14,117
We're just gonna go

01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:23,649
Okay. Okay. Well, okay.

Come on.
We're just gonna go...

Okay. Okay.

253
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,083
All right. Okay.

254
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:42,684
Okay?

255
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,415
Where are the keys?

256
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,115
- Where are the keys?
- I don't...

257
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:56,882
Oh.

258
01:00:56,884 --> 01:01:00,248
Okay.

259
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,784
Okay. Okay.

260
01:01:03,551 --> 01:01:06,384
Okay. Arthur, just go...

261
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:14,150
Okay.

262
01:01:14,817 --> 01:01:15,817
We're coming.

263
01:01:36,584 --> 01:01:38,715
Arthur? Arthur?

264
01:01:38,717 --> 01:01:42,749
The hatch outside,
is that a way out?

265
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:45,749
No, no, no. No, just wait here.
Just wait here.

266
01:01:45,751 --> 01:01:47,815
I'll be back
in one minute, okay?

267
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,181
I'll be back in one minute.

268
01:03:03,817 --> 01:03:05,050
Oh!

01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,250
No!

271
01:05:20,884 --> 01:05:25,148
No, no, no!

272
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:31,448
Arthur!

273
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,617
Arthur!

274
01:05:35,384 --> 01:05:39,183
No! Arthur!

Help me!

277
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:57,317
Help me!

278
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,250
Hello?

279
01:10:58,817 --> 01:11:00,150
It's all right.

280
01:11:01,384 --> 01:11:02,849
It's all over.

281
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:05,615
I'll tell everyone
what your dad did to you.

282
01:11:05,617 --> 01:11:06,784
No...

283
01:11:08,183 --> 01:11:10,382
You don't have
to hide here anymore.

284
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:15,684
It's you.

285
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:18,248
It's you.

286
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,715
We see what we want to see.

287
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:30,117
No.

288
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,450
I'm Emma.

289
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,584
What have you done?

290
01:11:37,484 --> 01:11:38,584
What have you done?

291
01:11:39,217 --> 01:11:40,250
No.

292
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,417
No.

293
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,617
No!

294
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:58,649
Mom?

295
01:11:58,651 --> 01:12:00,315
It's over.

296
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,615
It's over.

297
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:02,617
Mom.

298
01:12:03,617 --> 01:12:05,284
Emma.

299
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:09,551
I missed you so much.
