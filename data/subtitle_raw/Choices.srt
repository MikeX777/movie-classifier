1
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,939
The undefeated
favorites... team

2
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,199
doesn't seem to playing
their usual game.

3
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,789
With less than a
minute left, they're

4
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,650
still trailing by five points.

5
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,790
We gotta double right.

6
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,649
36 slam on...

7
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,349
read.

8
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,070
Break!

9
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,699
Gonna win this
game and make it score.

10
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,369
They have the ball deep
in their own territory.

11
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,940
Quarterback Pat...
number ten is calling the play.

12
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,629
He almost drops the ball,
but he makes the hand off

13
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,530
to star running back
number 45, John Carluccio.

14
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:30,959
All right.

15
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,744
That was good now.

16
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:32,529
That was good.

17
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,630
Here's what we're going to do.

18
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,899
We're going to run a slot
left, passed 69, double in.

19
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,749
What's the matter, John?

20
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,450
John?

21
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,739
Hey, ref!

22
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,809
Ref!

23
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,510
Need a time.

24
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,939
There's a time out on the field.

25
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,479
The quarterback is
motioning to the refs.

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,129
John Carluccio, number
45, the driving force

27
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,649
behind this amazing team
is leaving the field.

28
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,350
Lane?

29
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,659
Lance, where are you?

30
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,590
Right here.

31
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,979
All right.

32
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,409
Another $150 bucks.

33
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,259
I should have bought
stock in the company.

34
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,170
36...

35
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,369
Go ahead.

36
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,829
...backup running back

37
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,259
is coming into the game.

38
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,489
What's the matter?

39
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,490
You all right?

40
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,080
Come on, come on.

41
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,231
Will you hurry up?

42
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,169
...it's all right?

43
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,579
...batteries went dead.

44
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,419
Thank god.

45
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,320
You all right now?

46
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,230
Can you hear?

47
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,339
All right.

48
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,040
Come here.

49
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,459
Now get back in there.

50
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,739
John Carluccio comes running back

51
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,639
on the field and his replacement
number 31 Lance...

52
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,969
disappointedly leaves the field.

53
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,319
Guess you don't get
much playing time

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,119
serving backup to John Carluccio.

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
Lance must be a pretty frustrated
young man about this time.

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,549
Hut!

57
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,249
The clock ticking
away, quarterback Pat

58
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,129
...fades back
and throws a...

59
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,559
pass to number 45, John Carluccio.

60
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,439
Carluccio makes it down to the...

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,140
one yard line.

62
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:56,339
First down... high!

63
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,959
Hey, how about that pass, huh?

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,809
What do you mean pass?

65
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,559
It was a great catch.

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,540
He's making Pat look good.

67
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,021
All right, well, they're a
pretty good combination, huh?

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,619
Here's the play.

69
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,609
The quarterback...
is taking them all around him

70
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,310
himself.

71
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:18,699
He's got the whole
team out in front,

72
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,099
...Carluccio
does a great run.

73
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,089
Touchdown!
...does it again!

74
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,079
Winning another game...

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,069
keeping their undefeated
record intact.

76
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,569
Looks like for the first time ever,

77
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,120
...is gonna
have a winning team!

78
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,360
Way to go, guys!

79
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,841
We'll see you at the
championship game.

80
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,919
You can bet on it, Gary, if
I have anything to do with it.

81
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Fat chance!

82
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Christ?

83
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,789
Hey, bro, who won the game?

84
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,639
High.

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,489
What is this?

86
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,439
Another set of wheels?

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,390
You know my old lady, man.

88
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:19,909
She married some rich
old dude in Houston.

89
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,489
This is my wedding gift.

90
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,269
Hey, say hello to...

91
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,739
Hi.

92
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,959
Chris, where have you been?

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,469
Haven't seen you too much lately.

94
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,919
Vacationing.

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,840
Where?

96
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,689
Take a guess.

97
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,829
Alcatraz.

98
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,599
It's close.

99
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,189
State Country Club for Boys.

100
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,059
Well, that figures.

101
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,659
Yeah, I finally make the big time.

102
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,249
If you need me, I'm back.

103
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,369
He's a real clown.

104
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,679
Wasn't that Jimmy's boy?

105
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,139
Yeah.

106
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,759
His father's serving time.

107
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,019
Yes.

108
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,339
Chris is all right.

109
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,690
Eh, just don't turn
your back on him.

110
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,529
Bravo... bravo.

111
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,480
...what do you
say we gt something to eat?

112
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,079
Well, son, you still
play like an amateur.

113
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,579
But you eat like a pro.

114
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,339
You just quit, do you?

115
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,040
Quit?

116
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,169
Why quit?

117
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,429
Well, at least your
grandson plays like Virtuoso.

118
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,570
No thanks to you.

119
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,100
Pat, two minutes, man!

120
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,779
Mom?

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Dad?

122
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,609
Bye.

123
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,520
Hey, kid?

124
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,019
Pat's waiting, dad.

125
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
...terrific.

126
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:01,741
Maybe you oughtta try
putting on some pants.

127
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,319
Thank you.

128
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,350
Have a good day.

129
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,439
May I help you?

130
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Two.

131
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,379
Oh.

132
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,059
That's $4.45 with tax.

133
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,800
Don't bother wrapping them.

134
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,169
You know, Rose, it warms the heart

135
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,069
to see kids taking precautions.

136
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,579
...that's, uh, better.

137
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,469
Susie...

138
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,379
Well, if I am...

139
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,389
You do?

140
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,859
...come...
didn't get...?

141
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,549
I don't know.

142
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,759
Well, you gotta come by.

143
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,359
At least to the locker
room and say hello.

144
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,149
OK.

145
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,509
Wanna come next week?

146
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,449
I mean, can you blame
a guy for seeking

147
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,480
a out a more mature relationship.

148
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,729
Honest, I really like you, Susie.

149
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,400
You're gonna make me puke.

150
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,489
...I just met you five
minutes ago and you're all over

151
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,489
me like an octopus.

152
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,329
Susan?

153
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,170
What?

154
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,519
I wanna talk to you.

155
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,249
Not now.

156
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:50,959
Come on.

157
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,670
Laura!

158
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:53,399
I wanna tell you
something in the kitchen.

159
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,309
...would you get off?

160
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,699
God, you jocks are all the
same, groping sex maniacs.

161
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,169
Laura, what do you want?

162
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,710
I don't know what to do.

163
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,349
Word came directly
from Ron, I swear.

164
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,699
Ron?

165
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,729
Ron is the biggest
BS artist in school.

166
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,580
Do you like him?

167
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:12,550
I guess so.

168
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:13,799
I mean, do you like him?

169
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,499
Yeah.

170
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,960
OK.

171
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,599
Well, do you wanna do it?

172
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,299
All right.

173
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,290
What do you want from me?

174
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,899
Blind dates, it's always
a shot in the dark.

175
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,219
You know that.

176
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,139
Pat, I thought we
were passed this stage.

177
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,359
Ron, he set us up.

178
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,559
What are you complaining about?

179
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,859
Look who's making the sacrifices.

180
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,199
Shh.

181
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,209
I gave up the beauty
of the beast, didn't I?

182
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,569
What beauty?

183
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,530
If you're so unhappy, let's trade.

184
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,890
No way.

185
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,449
Where'd you put them?

186
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,669
What?

187
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,619
You know.

188
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,590
Under the pillow.

189
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:52,560
What?

190
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,780
Under the pillow.

191
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,859
Mom, some friends just
came in for a quickie visit.

192
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Come on.

193
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,349
Outta here, you rotten
kids! Now

194
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,350
get out of here.

195
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:15,139
- You have no right to be...
- hi there. Come on,

196
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,839
come on.

197
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,920
It's time to go.

198
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,100
Out of here, you rotten kids!

199
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,799
At last, an improvement.

200
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,499
But don't let it go to your heads.

201
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,569
You're still quite a
ways from performing

202
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,440
with the Vienna Philharmonica.

203
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,309
And I would like you kids to
continue working from letter D.

204
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,870
And now scram.

205
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Hi, John.

206
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:56,289
Oh hi, Corri.

207
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,300
I, uh, heard about your
big score Saturday night.

208
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,879
Oh, well you know how it is.

209
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,159
Yeah, that's not what Suzie said.

210
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,699
Oh, by the way, you forgot
these balloons under the pillow.

211
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,369
See you later.

212
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,219
Hi, sis.

213
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Hi, pat.

214
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,150
Pat, look what your
sister just laid on me.

215
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,409
I knew she was growing
faster, but not this fast.

216
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,110
Come on.

217
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:34,209
Coach Rizzo will
really cheer us up.

218
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,819
Johnny, come here.

219
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,099
Pat, excuse us, eh?

220
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,830
Don't be late for practice.

221
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,279
Yes, grandpa?

222
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,679
Johnny, you missed a
couple of rehearsals

223
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,589
because of football practice.

224
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,689
And while I tried to
understand as your grandfather,

225
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,449
as your teacher, I
find it unacceptable.

226
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,779
Grandpa.

227
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,079
You're talented, gifted.

228
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,870
Don't waste it on barbarism.

229
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,399
Grandpa, give me a break, will you?

230
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,819
I've spoken to Mr. Hoit
of the Youth Symphony.

231
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,489
Now, he said he would accept you
because of my recommendation.

232
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,469
Now how many boys get an
opportunity like that?

233
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,849
You've got to get serious.

234
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,009
Forget football.

235
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,329
You need more rehearsals.

236
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,939
Grandpa, I just turned 17.

237
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,317
And all that's really important to me

238
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:35,209
right now is what I'm
doing on Saturday night.

239
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,530
You know what I mean?

240
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,639
Oh, yes.

241
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,729
But if you're old enough to mate,

242
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,709
you're old enough to make up
your own mind about your life.

243
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,589
You were my age.

244
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,029
All the brothers in
Naples had to keep

245
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,889
iron locks on their doors.

246
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,629
Well, my boy, I guess there's just

247
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,280
no way of getting
through to you, is there?

248
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,059
Coming?

249
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,550
How about that, huh?

250
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:12,009
- Come on, man.
- We're late.

251
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,560
We gotta get out of here.

252
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:14,709
We gotta get...

253
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,799
Rizzo's gonna kill us.

254
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,129
I will see you out there.

255
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,029
Wait, Pat.

256
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,229
I have something to show you.

257
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,929
What?

258
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,930
Come here.

259
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
Ouch!

260
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,069
Boy, isn't he a handsome guy?

261
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,149
That's pretty funny.

262
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,150
Come here.

263
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,209
25 laps.

264
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,650
How many miles is that?

265
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,659
Six or seven.

266
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,919
Oh.

267
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,010
No more hot idea.

268
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,820
No more...

269
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,819
Let's get something to drink.

270
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,119
Yeah.

271
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,709
- How was the olympic?
- Huh?

272
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,750
What's up, coach?

273
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:12,959
This way.

274
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,299
Sure, coach.

275
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,349
I want to to know.

276
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,350
What is it?

277
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,319
You're disqualified.

278
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,280
I'm, I'm what?

279
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,889
You're disqualified.

280
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,559
I had nothing to do
with it, honest to god.

281
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,599
It's the new district
medical examiner, Dr. Bowers.

282
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,459
Dr. Bowers?

283
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,689
He says you can't play
with a hearing handicap.

284
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,989
Handicap?

285
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,079
He's never even examined me.

286
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,109
It's in the records, John.

287
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,110
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
What is this?

289
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,149
A union meeting or something?

290
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,169
Come on, break it up.

291
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,610
Is that all then?

292
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,419
I gotta stick by the rules.

293
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,829
Without John, we're
not a championship team.

295
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,169
That's what we got.

296
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,689
You got the word.

297
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,299
John's disqualified.

298
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,780
I've been shooting my mouth off
with the doctor for over an hour.

299
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:17,109
And all he comes up with
is the same answer, no.

300
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,810
N-O.

301
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,499
Are you the coach or not?

302
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,210
As far as the doc's concerned,
coaches are canned jellyfish.

303
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:04,159
Did I tell you they
gave me a new secretary?

304
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,469
No.

305
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,089
Oh, yeah.

306
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,139
A beauty.

307
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,839
Well, she must be because
obviously she can't type.

308
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,580
You know what?

309
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,280
What?

310
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,719
I forgot to ask.

311
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,669
No monkey business.

312
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,670
Mm.

313
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,790
Oh,

314
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:47,559
You know it's 11:30
and John's not home yet.

315
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,599
Well, he's a growing boy.

316
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,049
You're gonna have
to get used to it.

317
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,329
Not on week days.

318
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,589
Huh, come on.

319
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,200
Let him have a little fun.

320
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,759
John, are you all right?

321
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,019
Yeah, just fabulous.

322
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,779
Why didn't you call me?

323
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,380
I didn't get a chance to.

324
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,909
What the hell was all that?

325
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,399
I don't know.

326
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,850
John?

327
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,530
That was quite
an entrance down there.

328
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,370
Don't like you talking that
way to your mother...

329
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,110
Come on, John.

330
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:07,599
You wanna tell me or not?

331
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,179
I'd love to you about it, dad.

332
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,809
I can't play on the team any more.

333
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,769
I'm disqualified.

334
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,719
What are you talking about?

335
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,899
Something about my handicap.

336
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,689
But you never said
I was handicapped.

337
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,529
They're telling me I'm handicap..

338
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,230
Now wait a minute.

339
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,999
Somebody's flipped
their rocker here.

340
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,149
You're perfectly normal.

341
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,800
Well, not according
to Dr. Bowers I'm not.

342
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,609
Bowers?

343
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,480
He's, he's a has been.

344
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,179
Thee guy that replaced
Dr. Silver after he

345
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,630
suffered from a stroke.

346
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,049
Dad, if they don't let me
play, I'm quitting school.

347
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,309
Hold it, hold it now.

348
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,669
Playing football is important, but

349
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,459
your education's still number one.

350
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,639
We always agreed on that.

351
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,069
I wanna bust the place up!

352
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,460
All right.

353
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,069
Now we'll fight
him, but we'll do it

354
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,429
through the proper channels
and without losing our head.

355
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,739
Am I handicapped?

356
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Huh?

357
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,409
Answer me, am I handicapped?

358
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,819
Am I?

359
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,169
No.

360
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,110
Huh?

361
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,680
Come on now, I said no.

362
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,390
Come on John.

363
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:25,899
I'm gonna back you up.

364
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,579
Huh?

365
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,410
I'm gonna back you up.

366
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,489
Can I handle that?

367
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,990
All right then, come on.

368
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,249
It's all right.

369
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,299
I love you, dad.

370
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,249
By a majority vote of five to one,

371
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,629
the board has approved funds
converting all hand towel

372
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,240
dispensers in the toilet areas
to electric drying machines.

373
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:53,859
And now to the next
order of business.

374
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,859
Uh, Mr. Carluccio, uh, I have
your letter here requesting

375
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,489
a consideration of your son's case.

376
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,170
...you have
the floor...

377
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,719
Thank you, Mr. Henderson.

378
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,079
Um, I'm here seeking to overturn
a decision passed by Dr. Bowers

379
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,559
prohibiting my son
from playing football.

380
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,299
The directive is arbitrary
and discriminatory.

381
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,079
Discrimination is a
very strong accusation.

382
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,889
I'll prove it to you.

383
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,720
All right.

384
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:25,720
How?

385
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:27,189
By demonstrating that my son can

386
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,049
hear normally with
his hearing aid on.

387
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,840
John, would you step up here.

388
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,619
Now Mr. Carluccio,
um, would you

389
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,029
have your son remove
his hearing aid?

390
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:39,900
Why?

391
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,389
I've just proved he can hear
me even when my back is turned.

392
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,230
Well, you did.

393
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,779
But can he hear you
without his hearing aid?

394
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,700
Excuse me.

395
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:50,089
Um, Mr. Henderson,
but would you be

396
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,520
able to read without
your glasses, sir?

397
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,529
All right.

398
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,479
I remove my glasses.

399
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,229
I can still see, but can you
hear without your hearing aid?

400
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,539
Mr. Henderson, may I
say something, please?

401
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,899
Go ahead, Coach Rizzo.

402
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,199
Well, uh, I just want to say
that John Carluccio is about

403
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,249
the best player I've ever coached.

404
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,820
Why, I'd play him if he were
cock-eyed and horse-tailed.

405
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,519
Thank you.

406
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,219
Can we proceed now?

407
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,149
The board should immediately
reverse Dr. Bowers decision.

408
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,009
Now just a moment.

409
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,379
There are six members on this board

410
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,779
and we are trying objectively
and democratically

411
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,359
to examine both sides
of the question.

412
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,419
I don't think we can take a vote
until we've consulted with Dr.

413
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,429
Bowers, the legally
appointed medical examiner

414
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,519
of this district.

415
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,649
I will submit a written
report to the board.

416
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,350
There.

417
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:49,489
We'll convene again in two weeks.

418
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,660
Meeting adjourned.

419
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,379
...stop horsing
around and get out in the field!

420
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:37,049
Hey guys, I think
that is the first time

421
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,350
I have ever seen
Lance in the shower.

422
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,099
I hope it shrunk his head though.

423
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,650
Hey, John.

424
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:00,549
Can I help, coach?

425
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,670
Yeah, sure, John.

426
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,609
How does that feel?

427
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,700
Feels real good, coach.

428
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:08,400
Thanks.

429
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:09,449
Oh, let's see.

430
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,099
How'd you like to take
out the ball bag, huh?

431
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,509
Sure.

432
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,290
OK, come on.

433
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,679
Everybody finish dressing outside.

434
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,440
Come on...

435
00:27:17,441 --> 00:27:17,885
Let's go.

436
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,330
Move it.

437
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,081
Come on, outside, everybody.

438
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,380
...take it easy, man.

439
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
Dr. Bowers?

440
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:51,159
Your father is very insistent
that I speak with you.

441
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,990
So, uh, pull up a chair.

442
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:09,149
That'll do.

443
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,094
Just there.

444
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:11,095
Thank you.

445
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,829
Can you hear me?

446
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,809
Yes, sir.

447
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,679
What did I say precisely?

448
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,710
Can you hear me.

449
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,799
Well, according to your
records you lost the hearing

450
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,019
in one ear and 50 percent in
the other at the age of eight.

451
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,720
Yeah, that's right.

452
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:42,399
A swimming accident.

453
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,489
And you've played football
since the age of seven.

454
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,009
Um, Dr. Bowers
does it say anything

455
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,699
in your records about
the fact that I've

456
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,059
played violin since
the age of three?

457
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,069
Oh, yes, yes.

458
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,070
Extraordinary.

459
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,229
Now, remove your
hearing aid, please.

460
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,939
I don't see the point.

461
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,740
I must have your cooperation.

462
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,609
Count from one to ten.

463
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,589
Count from one to ten, please.

464
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,839
What?

465
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,799
Oh, that's all right, son.

466
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,939
I've been asking you to
count from one to ten.

467
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,429
It, it's all right.

468
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,350
Remove the hearing aid, please.

469
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,189
Why are you doing this to me?

470
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,769
Please understand me.

471
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,539
My only and primary
interest is the preservation

472
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,869
of whatever little
hearing you may have left.

473
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,099
It's only a minor disability.

474
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,209
You don't read lips.

475
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,279
Can you do sing language?

476
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,709
Hell no.

477
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,410
Why, should I?

478
00:30:42,411 --> 00:30:45,729
Well, I wish it were
only a minor disability,

479
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,089
but I'm afraid it's
much more than that.

480
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,949
The way I see it, you
endanger not only yourself

481
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,939
by playing, but
also your teammates.

482
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,809
We haven't had an
injury in two years.

483
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,119
And I have proven my abilities.

484
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,719
At best I say you've
been lucky to get

485
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,869
away with it as long as you have.

486
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,069
You're turning me into
some kind of freak.

487
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,069
That's preposterous.

488
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,960
I'm acting in accordance
of my best judgement.

489
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,759
What'd he say?

490
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,460
Nothing.

491
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:32,299
There's nothing
wrong with you, man.

492
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,879
Yeah, they oughtta
bring doc Silver back.

493
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,580
I don't know.

494
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:36,649
Maybe that doctor's
got a point, you know?

495
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,339
That's rotten coming
from you, Lance.

496
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,040
You've got asthma.

497
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,959
What makes you so
different from me, huh?

498
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,169
What makes you different from me?

499
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,870
Come on, man.

500
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:47,149
I'm sorry.

501
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:17,689
No, no, no.

502
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,279
Drop it, please, like this.

503
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,539
Dah, dah, dah.

504
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,390
Pick up to three.

505
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:25,659
Trumpets only, huh?

506
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,309
All right now.

507
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,969
One, two, three, four.

508
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,799
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

509
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,769
You see, it all begins with scales.

510
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,429
You must practice
your scales every day.

511
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,319
They are your voices.

512
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,429
The maestro Pablo Casals said,
scales were his teachers.

513
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,819
They liberated him.

514
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,219
Trumpets, again.

515
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,329
One, two, three, four.

516
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:59,269
One, two, three, four.

517
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,219
One... John?

518
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,659
John!

519
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,090
Lisa, take over.

520
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,070
John?

521
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:35,359
Don't jeopardize the good things
you have going for yourself.

522
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
Like what?

523
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,429
Dah, dah, dah?

524
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,339
Yes, absolutely, dah, dah, dah.

525
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,489
Take what's happening
as an opportunity

526
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,579
to concentrate on what
is really important.

527
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,969
Get off your high
horse, will you grandpa?

528
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,199
You know what's important?

529
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,959
What's important is that I
don't feel like playing today.

530
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,929
That's what's important.

531
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,849
And it's my own decision.

532
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,059
My own damn decision.

533
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,660
So go dah dah yourself.

534
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,550
It had better be worth it.

535
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,769
I don't find this one bit amusing.

536
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,509
It's not meant to be.

537
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,209
All right, come on.

538
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,190
Let's circle up, let's go.

539
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,189
Doctor.

540
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,970
Let's go.
Let's go.

541
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:25,669
Come on.

542
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,480
Let's go, come on.

543
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,481
All right.

544
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,589
All right, ready, let's go.

545
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,569
17...

546
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,909
17.

547
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,809
Come on!

548
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,549
I can't.

549
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,290
Why not?

550
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,489
I don't wanna hurt the guy.

551
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,480
- You know.
- Come on.

552
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:40,180
Come on.

553
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,539
This is John's chance
to prove himself.

554
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,540
Come on.

555
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,330
I said break it up!

556
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,270
Shut up!

557
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:07,879
Shut up...!

558
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,840
I'm surprised at you.

559
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:10,909
I stick out and this is
the way you repay me, huh?

560
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,640
He asked for it!

561
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:12,869
I don't care who asked for it!

562
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,760
You know my rules!

563
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:14,459
No fighting!

564
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,399
Well, I'm sorry.

565
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,340
That's not good enough!

566
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,579
Now go on, take you uniform off.

567
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,280
You're through.

568
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:18,670
Go on.

569
00:36:18,671 --> 00:36:19,059
Beat it.

570
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,840
Get out of here.

571
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:20,841
Get out.

572
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,740
And you, you creep.

573
00:36:27,741 --> 00:36:28,901
You're suspended.

574
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,630
What about tomorrow's game, coach?

575
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:45,619
I said you're
suspended till tomorrow.

576
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,019
Now shut up!

577
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,299
Hey, Pops.

578
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,300
Hi, Johnny.

579
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:39,229
Hey, You're a little
early, ain't you?

580
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,889
I didn't have any practice today.

581
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,209
Is there like a soda or something.

582
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,219
Oh, yeah.

583
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,409
Chris is here, huh?

584
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,029
Yeah, he's here.

585
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,279
Wish to heck he wasn't.

586
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,969
He's as welcome as a
skunk at a church social.

587
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,979
Now don't you go getting
into no trouble, you hear?

588
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,239
I won't.

589
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
See you.

590
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,049
It's nice.

591
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,199
Think I'm gonna
call it, "Heart Sick.

592
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,039
Teenage Bourbon Alcohol Blues."

593
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:39,379
Well, I'm always
open to suggestions.

594
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,159
OK, well, take it from the hook.

595
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
OK.

596
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,349
...country love.

597
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,339
Country love.

598
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,820
Country love.

599
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:59,539
Nice compromise.

600
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,859
It's a deal.

601
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,849
It's a song.

602
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,459
Well, why don't you, um, why
don't you come on Saturday

603
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,349
and bring your axe and...?

604
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,669
Well, I had a blast last
session, so I'd love to.

605
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,629
OK.

606
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,329
See you.

607
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,330
OK, Saturday.

608
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,959
All right.

609
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:37,829
Election time...
All right, bro.

610
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,830
One for you.

611
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,269
Hey, John.

612
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,220
Hi, how you doing?

613
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:45,010
Good.

614
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:46,139
You haven't lost your touch.

615
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,549
I keep in practice, you know.

616
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,049
I got a couple of, uh,
buddies I want you to meet.

617
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,229
You've got, uh,
Herman here and Jess.

618
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,469
Hey, hey, what's you say?

619
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,399
How you going?

620
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,119
Come on over to our table and
meet a couple of foxy ladies.

621
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,210
US bred and prime beef.

622
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,039
Here we got, we got
Samantha and Linda.

623
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,650
This is John Tiger Carluccio,
Mr. Grid Iron itself.

624
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,160
Pops...

625
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,259
Hey, how's your dad?

626
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,959
He's doing pretty well.

627
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,039
He just got promoted to district
sales manager at Metro Life.

628
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,359
Metro Life?

629
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,689
Yeah.

630
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,269
That's kinda like my old man.

631
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,530
He got promoted from... to Sing Sing.

632
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,139
I hear you ain't on a team anymore.

633
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:59,069
Yeah, some quack doctor
barred from all contact sports.

634
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,660
Want my boys to squeeze
his nose a little?

635
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,470
Na.

636
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,279
John?

637
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,290
You don't any coach on your
back to worry about now.

638
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,519
Welcome to the adult world.

639
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,779
Hello?

640
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,249
Yes?

641
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,250
What?

642
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,800
No, we weren't aware that
he was absent from school.

643
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,010
Um, expulsion?

644
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,990
Mr. Martin, he's been going
through an awful lot lately.

645
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,429
Yes.

646
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,790
Of course we'll do
what's necessary.

647
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,450
OK.

648
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
John?

649
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,430
Give me a beer.

650
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,070
I don't believe it.

651
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,690
Ah.

652
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,069
I think the boys might want a beer.

653
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,649
Go on, give them one.

654
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,999
How about two?

655
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,750
Why not?

656
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:23,229
Hey boys, how about a
little Gatorade, huh?

657
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,469
Vitamin C enriched.

658
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,470
Cheers.

659
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:35,799
You trying to get kicked
out of school or what?

660
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,179
Come on, who cares, huh?

661
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,939
Where's your P-R-I-D-E?

662
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,820
What is this?

663
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,899
A spelling bee?

664
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,639
No.

665
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
It means pride.

666
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:53,879
I don't see anybody
asking your opinion.

667
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
All right.

668
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,219
Coach Rizzo sees this, you'll
never get on the team again.

669
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,220
Never.

670
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:09,079
Let's see if you
can spell this out.

671
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,569
You tell coach Rizzo to
take it and...

672
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,440
What's with you?

673
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,441
Split.

674
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,350
No way.

675
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,679
I don't blame you
for feeling bitter.

676
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:08,639
Hey, look it.

677
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,579
There's a lot of things
you can do to fight back.

678
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,269
But hanging out with...?

679
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,249
That sure isn't the way.

680
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,479
Are you gonna start preaching?

681
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,539
Look it, you do whatever you want.

682
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,909
Just let me say this first.

683
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,129
A skunk don't stink all the time,

684
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,929
but if you don't watch
out, it'll spray you.

685
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,770
Why don't you lay off Christ?

686
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:35,189
It'll spray you?

687
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,559
Jeez.

688
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,919
If you don't
watch out, it'll spray you.

689
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,069
I don't know..

690
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:50,179
Why don't you share some of
the stuff you've been smoking?

691
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,700
If you don't
watch out it'll spray you.

692
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:56,019
Hey listen, forget
those creeps, man.

693
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,189
I mean, you're still one of us.

694
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,979
Nothing's changed.

695
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,909
It's all in your mind.

696
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,120
The guys need you.

697
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,919
You mean that?

698
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,359
Yeah, sure.

699
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,279
Who's more psyched
up than you, anyway?

700
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:10,979
Come on.

701
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,980
Let's go down...

702
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:12,981
Sure.

703
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,210
Dynamite chick.

704
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:21,600
Oh.

705
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:22,629
That's just dying to meet you.

706
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,330
What?

707
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:24,589
Another one of your
hack blind dates?

708
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,629
No thanks.

709
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,910
Ah, yeah.

710
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:35,299
Let's go...

711
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,099
Ah, looking good, right!

712
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,440
Right!

713
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:41,849
Get them up, get them up,
get them up!

714
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:59,309
Hey coach, why don't
you let me gear up

715
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,879
and get in there are run
a couple of plays just

716
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,349
to keep my timing sharp, huh?

717
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,350
I can't.

718
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,640
Where you going?

719
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:15,659
I busted my chin strap.

720
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,909
Well, hurry it up.

721
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:17,610
All right, all right.

722
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:18,009
Let's go.

723
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:18,710
Huddle up, huddle up.

724
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:19,420
Quiet.

725
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,619
All right, quiet down though.

726
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,320
That was good.

727
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:23,179
That was very good.

728
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,809
How's it going, John?

729
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,299
Hey, hey, hey, all right.

730
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,099
That's good, that's good...

731
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,599
All right!

732
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,349
OK, come on.

733
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,099
Come on.

734
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,090
Let's huddle up, huddle up.

735
00:47:36,091 --> 00:47:37,091
Come on.

736
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,720
All right, let's go, lads.

737
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:42,721
Let's go.

738
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,419
Lousy, Bob.

739
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,640
How about yourself?

740
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,620
We miss your play, man.

741
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:58,960
That's good.

742
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:02,890
That's good!

743
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:21,989
Hey, I'll be seeing
you around, John, huh?

744
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,659
All right, let's
go, let's go, let's go!

745
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,819
...first down,
you know they play.

746
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,519
Let's go.

747
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,470
Let's go, let's go.

748
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:30,909
Come on, make it look good now.

749
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:53,029
Make any money today, Pop?

750
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,759
- Eh, broke even.
- Eh, boy.

751
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,829
You need a lift?

752
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,359
Ah, no, not tonight.

753
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,849
I think I'm gonna bike it home.

754
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,744
Take it easy.

755
00:49:02,745 --> 00:49:03,745
All right.

756
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,930
Uh, Johnny, come here.

757
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,309
Now look, kid, Just
a word of advice.

758
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,029
Life is funny.

759
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,599
Sometimes you're the
bug and sometimes you're

760
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,600
the windshield.

761
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:40,289
Sometimes I'm the what?

762
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,059
You know what I mean.

763
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,429
I know you've had it rough,
but this ain't the answer.

764
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:50,209
Now you've got a real good future

765
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:53,609
if you'll just stick to your
music and your school books.

766
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:56,909
This ain't for you.

767
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,289
You just give some
darn serious thoughts

768
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,890
to what I've said to you.

769
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,370
Can I come in?

770
00:51:01,649 --> 00:51:02,649
Yeah, sure.

771
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,980
I'm finished anyway.

772
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,689
You know, one day they'll
stand in line to see you.

773
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,190
Sure, selling
hamburgers at McDonald's.

774
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,890
Hey, come here.

775
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,649
Listen, I know things seem
a little dim right now.

776
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,849
Like my old coach
always used to say,

777
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,679
every adversity, every
headache, carries with it

778
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,279
the seed of an equivalent
or greater benefit.

779
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,320
Words suck, dad.

780
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,330
Listen, John.

781
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:53,059
Um, did you ever
think perhaps, there

782
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,770
might be some truth in
what the doctors say?

783
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:08,759
First the doctor,
then coach, now you.

784
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,819
Come on, take it easy.

785
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,720
I'm just questioning it.

786
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:12,189
What the hell is there to question?

787
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,489
Risk of injury.

788
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,199
Injury?

789
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,900
Injury.

790
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:19,549
You know, that's I've been
hearing lately, injury.

791
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,449
You really just don't
understand, do you?

792
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,290
Well, you think I don't know?

793
00:52:28,169 --> 00:52:31,529
I was headed for college
sophomore of the years honors.

794
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,119
Just because you got hurt doesn't

795
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,049
mean I'm gonna get hurt.

796
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:36,750
Right.

797
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,699
All right.

798
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,799
But do you think that's going
to you where you're headed?

799
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,670
Big deal.

800
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:43,759
So I smoke a little.

801
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,909
The point is, John,
you're breaking the rules!

802
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,299
Now if you want to win,
you do with some discipline

803
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,340
and now falling.

804
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,629
Come on, hit me again, big shot.

805
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,430
What difference does it make?

806
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,949
How about a hand for
the man who helped me

807
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,389
write this song, John Carluccio.

808
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:03,279
...outlaws.

809
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:06,181
We'll be back in a few minutes.

810
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,180
Hi.

811
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:39,699
I didn't know you could
play the country...

812
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,129
...with Jimmy O. Now.

813
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,199
Did I see you come
in here with Chris?

814
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,479
Yeah, it's no big deal.

815
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,869
Besides, I thought
he was your friend.

816
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:49,870
He is.

817
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,779
But I've known him
since kindergarten.

818
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,119
Well, I'm here with Sam.

819
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,049
Sam?

820
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:58,749
Samantha.

821
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,450
The blonde.

822
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:00,219
Oh.

823
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:00,980
She's my cousin.

824
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:03,061
Anyway, she asked me to tag along.

825
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,610
Who are you here with?

826
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:21,119
An old friend.

827
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,150
You're loosing your touch, John.

828
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,009
You're not kidding.

829
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,140
Lately I'm batting a big fat zero.

830
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,570
I know someone that can
end that batting slump.

831
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:40,979
You're serious, aren't you?

832
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,980
Mhmm.

833
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,999
I mean, you're like a
little kid sister to me.

834
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,009
Maybe not that little
any more, but... besides,

835
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,889
your brother Pat would murder
me if I ever laid a hand on you.

836
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,260
Who said I'd let you?

837
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,309
Do you wanna dance?

838
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,190
Hi, guys.

839
00:57:55,191 --> 00:57:56,439
What's going on?

840
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,140
Hey, John.

841
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:00,609
John, we got a little surprise...

842
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,829
Why don't you try a little?

843
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:04,649
No, Chris.

844
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,780
Come on, it'll make you feel good.

845
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,239
Come on.

846
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,649
Go.

847
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Yeah.

848
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,079
Huh?

849
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,829
Come on, two toots
are better than one.

850
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,319
John.

851
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,790
Hurry up.

852
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,269
John.

853
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,590
You got it on your nose.

854
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:29,591
Wipe your nose.

855
00:58:40,499 --> 00:58:42,119
John, please take me home.

856
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,110
Come on, pretty mama.

857
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:44,589
Fun's just beginning.

858
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:47,559
Hey, cousin Corri, Chris
says he has a surprise.

859
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,560
Come on.

860
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,629
Chris is right.

861
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,680
...OK?

862
00:58:56,359 --> 00:58:57,739
What is going on here?

863
00:58:58,441 --> 00:59:00,239
Chris... what is this?

864
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,249
Another car?

865
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,419
...get in.

866
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,779
We go... come on!

867
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,599
Hello, Cadillac.

868
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,079
I've had my eyes on
you for a long time.

869
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,419
Wow, a limousine.

870
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,290
You know what to do?

871
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:43,989
Yeah.

872
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:44,780
Give me 30.

873
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:45,579
30?

874
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,580
You got it.

875
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:11,679
One, two, three...

876
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:26,619
Five six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, 11,

877
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,610
16,

878
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:40,479
21, 22, 23,

879
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,280
He did it.

880
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,540
...come on!

881
01:00:58,541 --> 01:00:59,751
I can't believe...

882
01:01:00,431 --> 01:01:01,431
Shh, shh.

883
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,940
Oh, John, I don't wanna go.

884
01:01:09,429 --> 01:01:11,229
I can't believe...

885
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,630
Come on, man.

886
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,119
You chicken?

887
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,899
I don't wanna go.

888
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:27,550
Yee haw!

889
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,699
Please let me out!

890
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,309
Chris, stop the car.

891
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:26,479
Let me out!

892
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,480
Sure, go ahead.

893
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,620
Chris, stop the car.

894
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:00,620
Let go!

895
01:03:00,621 --> 01:03:02,219
I'm trying to drive, jerk!

896
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,459
Watch it!

897
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,400
Now where the hell have you been?

898
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,420
Morning.

899
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:09,029
Juice?

900
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,030
No, mom.

901
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,220
Dad?

902
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,180
Dad?

903
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,829
Nobody's perfect.

904
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,040
I'm learning that.

905
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,250
It won't happen again.

906
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:19,839
John, we trust you.

907
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,109
Don't hang us up.

908
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,110
All right?

909
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:30,409
All right.

910
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:31,570
No more questions.

911
01:07:34,219 --> 01:07:35,779
I'll get your breakfast.

912
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,940
Thanks, mom.

913
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,179
Here, read the comics.

914
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:56,599
John, Corri wants to talk to you.

915
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,869
Corri?

916
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:58,870
Wow.

917
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,759
The police got Herman.

918
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,949
That's too bad.

919
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,789
You can thank Chris for that.

920
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,509
Chris blames you.

921
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,599
He told Sam that he
lost control of the limo

922
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,989
because you bugged him.

923
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:26,389
That guy is definitely a psycho.

924
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,260
I don't want anything
to do with him any more.

925
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,959
So pretty here.

926
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,979
Yeah, sometimes I come
down here and I play my violin.

927
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:41,219
There's something very magical
about nature and music.

928
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,969
You love your music, don't you?

929
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,670
Yeah.

930
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:46,119
I can remember my grandfather
putting a violin in my hands

931
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,079
when I was three.

932
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,989
He'd like to think I'd
become another...

933
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,859
You never know
if you really studied.

934
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:55,589
Well, I don't know.

935
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,799
Now, my dad, he was supposed
to become another...

936
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,359
But he wrote poetry
and played football

937
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,579
until he hurt his knees.

938
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,449
Did he ever
publish any of his poems?

939
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:04,839
Na.

940
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,669
I think he sent some out once.

941
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,469
But they got rejected.

942
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:12,239
He lost heart and that's when
he got into selling insurance.

943
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,549
I'll bet your
grandfather went wild.

944
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,879
Poor dad.

945
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,919
Some day, when I become a somebody,

946
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,770
I'm gonna publish his poetry.

947
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,419
Without even reading it.

948
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:31,599
You know, you're a
hard one to figure out.

949
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,589
I mean, you play violin.

950
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,899
You're willing to go out
on the football field

951
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,259
and roll in the mud
with a bunch of animals.

952
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,189
Bash your head in.

953
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:43,119
It's, it's a contradiction.

954
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,569
Weird.

955
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:47,189
You're a menace to my ego.

956
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:50,769
Be serious, John.

957
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,639
Are you playing football
to prove something?

958
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,429
I mean, is it because
of your dad or, or is it

959
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:01,589
your hearing problem?

960
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,679
What are you trying to prove?

961
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,419
You some kind of
shrink or something?

962
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:08,099
Someday I will be.

963
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,949
Oh, no.

964
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:11,129
A weirdo.

965
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:13,570
Forget about practicing
with me, Corri.

966
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,539
John?

967
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,540
John!

968
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:43,870
John?

969
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,310
John?

970
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,410
I roll in the mud!

971
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:13,309
In the past, when I
used to look at you,

972
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,009
Go on.

973
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,010
Don't stop.

974
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:25,429
A light used to kind of go
off in my brain, you know?

975
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:28,349
Incest, incest.

976
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:31,179
Only yesterday, you were...

977
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,520
Skinny little sister.

978
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,300
I remember you as the
fattest kid on the block.

979
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,380
I'm not trying to prove anything.

980
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:55,220
The only thing I really
can't do is hear in stereo.

981
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,610
Why don't you try
stacking up the speakers?

982
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:31,229
The next item on
this evening's agenda

983
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:35,159
will be the decision on
the John Carluccio matter.

984
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,319
May I have the Dr. Bowers file?

985
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,320
Thank you.

986
01:12:40,759 --> 01:12:43,879
Dr. Bowers' report was read
to members of the board

987
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,629
and by a vote of four to two, they

988
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:49,719
decided to uphold the
doctor's decision.

989
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,540
Now we will.

990
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:54,369
The board can have my resignation

991
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,579
effective immediately.

992
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,630
Mr...?

993
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:59,890
You mean that's it?

994
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:02,419
There's no more discussion?

995
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,059
Mr. Carluccio,
the matter has been resolved.

996
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,559
What do you mean
it's been resolved?

997
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,599
- What's the word?
- Pride!

998
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,300
What's the word?

999
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:08,989
Pride!

1000
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:09,720
What's the word?

1001
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:10,420
Pride!

1002
01:13:10,421 --> 01:13:11,539
We want John!

1003
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,349
We want John!

1004
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,470
I would like to know the
meaning of this intrusion.

1005
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:22,999
John Carluccio won this
for the best Little League

1006
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,469
catcher five years
ago, batting 424.

1007
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,679
Very impressive.

1008
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,649
And this for...
Valley's most valuable

1009
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,599
football player, John Carluccio.

1010
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,210
How many more do you have?

1011
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,619
I am truly sorry, but...

1012
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,349
Oh, don't apologize.

1013
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,089
I just want you all to know that I

1014
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:51,120
think this is a gutless decision.

1015
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:58,829
Mr. Carluccio, we have
a very long agenda.

1016
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:59,830
Mr. Henderson?

1017
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,050
Yes, John?

1018
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:13,599
Ever since I've
been taken off the team,

1019
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,549
there's been a lot
of talk, feelings.

1020
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:26,409
From my dad, my mom, my
friends, school board,

1021
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,410
it's like whether I play
or not is a big deal.

1022
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,339
And people are asking why, why do I

1023
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,980
wanna play, what am
I trying to prove.

1024
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:49,909
I'd like to play football, just
like I like to play the violin.

1025
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:53,359
One really isn't more
important than the other one.

1026
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,459
Now a doctor says that
I can't play football.

1027
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:02,029
And it seems pretty simple to me.

1028
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,179
Why, I don't like being
told I can't do something

1029
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:09,869
I know that I'm capable of doing.

1030
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:11,530
I don't want be told that.

1031
01:15:13,129 --> 01:15:15,889
And I'm not going to
accept being told that.

1032
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,069
Well said, John!

1033
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,539
My hands are tied.

1034
01:15:35,749 --> 01:15:36,749
That's it.

1035
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,750
One more now.

1036
01:15:41,839 --> 01:15:43,749
Now let me have your attention.

1037
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,649
Let me have your attention.

1038
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,999
By this time tomorrow, we'll be
in the playoffs, which should

1039
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,709
put us in the championship game.

1040
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:53,769
Now we've beat these
guys before on our field

1041
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:55,539
and we can do it again.

1042
01:15:55,540 --> 01:16:00,859
Now, I want you guys to
concentrate and execute.

1043
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,779
But you're gonna have
to want it bad enough.

1044
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,859
Do you want it bad enough?

1045
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,560
Yeah!

1046
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:05,949
Do you want it bad enough?

1047
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,609
Yeah!

1048
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:09,319
I'm proud of you guys.

1049
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,589
Don't disappoint me.

1050
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:11,909
We've come this far.

1051
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:13,839
Disappoint me, I'm
gonna cut your ears

1052
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,620
off and hang them on my belt!

1053
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,010
And get to bed early!

1054
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:19,889
No partying, OK, let's go!

1055
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,760
John?

1056
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:46,590
Go, go, go, go, go!

1057
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:51,699
Get him!

1058
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,550
Pick him up!

1059
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:02,850
...huh?

1060
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,629
Get him up.

1061
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:14,630
Get him up!

1062
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,269
John?

1063
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,849
Chris.

1064
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:45,579
Hey Jess, where's Herman?

1065
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:49,079
He's on a forced vacation.

1066
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,050
Why?

1067
01:20:50,051 --> 01:20:52,549
Because of him.

1068
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:54,339
Can you hear that?

1069
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:55,340
Chris.

1070
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,269
You.

1071
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:04,099
And you?

1072
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:04,890
How about you?

1073
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:07,269
Are you OK now?

1074
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:11,329
You were very troubled when
you came to see me last week.

1075
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:15,109
Yes, especially since
we started classes.

1076
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:16,050
Good.

1077
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:18,709
Because when learn sign
language, and especially

1078
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,809
lip reading, then
you don't have to be

1079
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,149
afraid of not
communicating with anyone.

1080
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,289
That's what scared me...

1081
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:30,569
When Chris took my aid, I
was, I was, I don't know.

1082
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:32,639
It made me realize
that dad's not always

1083
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,539
going to be around
with a spare one.

1084
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,459
Would it be reassuring
to know that sign

1085
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,119
language isn't hard to learn?

1086
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,229
You know, I feel like I'm, I'm
a person finding his roots.

1087
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:47,729
Beginning to know
what I'm all about.

1088
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:48,839
Let's go...

1089
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
Let's start.

1090
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,219
OK, come on!

1091
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,569
OK, who wants first honor?

1092
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,269
I do.

1093
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:26,794
Come on, man.

1094
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:27,319
Let's go!

1095
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,099
Man, you're too small.

1096
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,030
What are you talking about?

1097
01:23:29,031 --> 01:23:30,259
Hey, you guys think you're tough?

1098
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:33,479
Come on, fair fight!

1099
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,959
I'll take all you
apes on one by one.

1100
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,939
Just like you did
with Carluccio, right?

1101
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,869
Come on, man!

1102
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,889
He's all right.

1103
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:53,489
From here on out, I'm
gonna call you...

1104
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:07,269
We're approaching the end

1105
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:09,329
of first half of this
championship game.

1106
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,640
High will kick
off down by touchdown.

1107
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:16,889
And the ball goes to number 33.

1108
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,349
Oscar...

1109
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,299
He's gotta wedge up the middle.

1110
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,739
...he's out the opening,

1111
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:26,159
going down the field... touchdown!

1112
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:30,729
High now trails by two touchdowns.

1113
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,769
They seem to have
run out of miracles.

1114
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,099
They sorely miss the player,
their star running back,

1115
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,359
John Carluccio, disqualified.

1116
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,729
Earlier this season

1117
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:39,499
because of a hearing handicap.

1118
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,699
High is desperately
in need of a scoring drive.

1119
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,829
Here comes the kickoff.

1120
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:47,319
...first and ten
on their own 27 yard line.

1121
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,549
Quarterback...
had the ball.

1122
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,939
He's fading back to pass.

1123
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:50,630
Oh!

1124
01:24:50,631 --> 01:24:52,849
Oh, boy did he get hit.

1125
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,649
He was sacked for a loss.

1126
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:57,859
Right now it looks pretty dismal
for... high fans.

1127
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:58,889
There's the snap.

1128
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:00,859
It's headed off to number
31, Lance...

1129
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,470
He's tackled for no gain.

1130
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:07,450
There's...

1131
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:09,009
It's a pitch out to Lance...

1132
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:11,339
...running
around...

1133
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,739
Pounded to the turf!

1134
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,279
Oh, he's not getting up.

1135
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,219
It looks like he may be injured.

1136
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:18,049
Time out on the field.

1137
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:20,479
If... is injured,
...chances for victory

1138
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,910
would seem to be
slipping further away.

1139
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:35,739
...do I
have your permission

1140
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,689
to put John in the game?

1141
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:38,849
What?

1142
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:41,270
I want your permission
to let him play.

1143
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:48,229
You got it.

1144
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,709
Hurry up and suit up!

1145
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,779
Get your ugly face in that game!

1146
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,869
You know you're committing suicide.

1147
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:57,269
Can you think of
a better way to go?

1148
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,619
Rizzo!

1149
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,949
Hey, what do you want from me?

1150
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:01,800
I got a game to win!

1151
01:26:01,801 --> 01:26:03,229
After the
punt... High

1152
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:06,189
has the ball first down
on their 29 yard line.

1153
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:06,890
Now.

1154
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:08,319
Wait a minute, folks.

1155
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,060
This is incredible!

1156
01:26:09,061 --> 01:26:11,209
John Carluccio, number
45, is I uniform

1157
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:13,110
and he's coming into the game!
