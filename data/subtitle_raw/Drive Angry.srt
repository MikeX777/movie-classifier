Her world was in a tailspin,

542

and King was preaching quiet revolution.

543
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:31,180
It was four months before she realized
"quiet" meant hiding

That's why I chose you.

1047
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:28,405
Webster will look out for you both,

1048
01:32:29,444 --> 01:32:31,503
as long as he can.

1049
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:32,877
(SOBBING) No, Milton.

1050
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:42,389
Milton, please, don't go.

1051
01:32:43,992 --> 01:32:45,789
Love her for me, Piper.

1052
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:49,161
Love her, and make her yours.

1053
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:56,971
I know I don't have a right to ask
for your promise.

1054
01:32:57,372 --> 01:33:01,741
I promise. Milton, I promise.

1055
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,169
Thank you.

1056
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:11,480
No.

(SOBBING)

1058
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:34,139
Hey.

1059
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,688
Come on.

1060
01:34:13,615 --> 01:34:14,877
Hi.

1061
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:21,020
- How was that?
- I've seen better.

1062
01:34:22,524 --> 01:34:23,923
Guess she doesn't know you can

1063
01:34:24,192 --> 01:34:27,218
beat him, slow him, shoot him,
even stop him.

1064
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:29,797
But you can't kill a dead man.

1065
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,993
Shall we?

1066
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:43,940
Even in hell there is compassion.

1067
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,651
Just so you know, I don't plan on staying.

1068
01:35:00,762 --> 01:35:03,230
Milton, you got what you wanted.

1069
01:35:03,298 --> 01:35:08,065
I did, but if he puts me back in that hole,
I'll still get out.

1070
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:09,965
Remarkable.

1071
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:12,368
I actually look forward to that.

1072
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,201
You think you're Wotan?

1073
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:24,079
Give me the keys.
