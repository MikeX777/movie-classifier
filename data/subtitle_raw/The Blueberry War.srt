1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,078
All similarities with real persons
and occurrences are intentional.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,636
"The Blueberry War"

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,029
No problem. Off course you can make
that money in Sweden.

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,675
It was my cousin Jerzy from Poland
who called me. I told him I would help.

5
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,992
We'll sort it out. Come up to Sweden
and we get you that money.

6
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,838
And here we are, in the middle of the
Swedish wilderness.

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,876
I already started to regret what I
had promised.

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Wake up Stefan. There is someone at
our place.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,433
I'm sleeping.

10
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,311
It's just a moose.

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,600
It is the chinese pack. They saw our
car at the road.

12
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,558
Sorry, we didn't see any sign this
was your place.

13
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,429
In Sweden there is a law they call
"All mens right".

14
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,718
This is Kongo-Rolle. He's the bodyguard
to one of the local berry buyers.

15
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,271
Nadja, the Russian, who mostly deals
with the Ukrainian pickers.

16
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,432
He did what?

17
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,469
Today... where are you?

18
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,798
What did he say?

19
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,113
Sedvallson?

20
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,599
Tell him to go to hell
if he comes back!

21
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,355
That asshole Sedvallson has been at
the Ukraine's and scared them.

22
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,840
Said that the immigration authority
will take their visa

23
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,956
If they don't sell to him.

24
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,634
Can he do that? He's just a runner
for the Berry king.

25
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,748
They have to. He has their
passports and documents.

26
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,318
He is worse than Stalin.
Fucking Blueberry Stalin!

27
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,800
I don't think you should
throw dirt on Stalin.

28
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,270
He made the Sovjet Union
a superpower.

29
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,874
You're stupid.
Stalin did nothing good!

30
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,397
Are you thinking like a baby?

31
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:41,760
Two other important characters in this story,
Ullabritten, the local EU business manager

32
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,199
And Svante Sedvallsson, the local dealer,
who's also involved in the berry trade.

33
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,311
This is big business, the last thing
we need is trouble with poles.

34
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,918
There is no problem with the poles.
It's the other pickers that makes fuss.

35
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,793
The Berry king is involved and his freezing
company in Poland... Polzamar...

36
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,953
Polzamarzac.

37
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,675
Ain't this cosy?

38
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:30,400
When my job get too intense,
I use to go out here and wash the car.

39
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,033
All tensions lose up.
It's like fucking in the Jacuzzi.

40
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,831
What is it, Svante?

41
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,199
I only have a shower at home.

42
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,837
They tell me you are a fixer.
You will help me with this, won't you?

43
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,470
It smells like curry, maybe they are
stealing hens somewhere.

44
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,596
That barrel is almost what
they have taken from us.

45
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,199
Rice with curry.

46
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,158
What about the rice?

47
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,834
No!

48
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,520
Have you got any berries, lads?

49
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,672
Just a few buckets, those fucking
chinks picked all our berries.

50
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,588
Stefan! They are here with our
blueberries.

51
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,000
Stop fighting for some lousy
litres of blueberries.

52
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,720
They have been a pain in the ass
the whole week.

53
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,637
Take it easy! Sit down while
I settle up with the others.

54
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
How many kilo, Monika?

55
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,880
138.

56
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,118
138.

57
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,632
We want money. Money, real money, no
paper!

58
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,952
Much blueberry, much work,
much paper, much money.

59
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,477
Monika, could you drive them
back to the camp?

60
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,195
They think I am some sort of cash
machine, but they like stamps.

61
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,470
Well boys, what can I do for you?

62
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,390
We have some berries to sell.

63
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,109
Forget the blueberries.
I have a real job for you.

64
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,518
Young, strong guys like you
shouldn't pick blueberries.

65
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,439
What about a real job.
Ten thousand. Black.

66
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,397
Black?

67
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,840
What did he say?

68
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,389
He has a good job, no tax.

69
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,516
A real job.

70
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,440
You'll do it in a week, ten days.

71
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,759
Wait, I'll show you.

72
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,840
He might cheat us.

73
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
We need the money, don't we?

74
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,320
What was that about no tax?

75
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,760
Come on, how was it with your sister?

76
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,992
Without contract and receipt he can
cheat us.

77
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:48,436
We have to raise the value of the building.
Water in the pool, repair the illuminated track...

78
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,755
Someone?

79
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,920
Most important is to get rid of the
loss from the last bankruptcy.

80
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:05,040
There must be some department with a profit
that can use the loss in their tax planning.

81
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,800
The dump is the only section with a
profit.

82
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,040
The dump is the only section with a
profit.

83
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,191
But they take the loss from
the theatre and the museum.

84
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,473
Did we pay the fire insurance this
year?

85
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,951
Yes, we did.

86
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,792
Good.
Further.

87
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,988
I've hired some carpenters for you.

88
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,039
Do you have a permit?

89
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,233
Molle will take care of it.

90
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,191
Do you know someone who can
put this place on fire?

91
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,518
I thought the Poles were going to buy
it?

92
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,358
I'm not sure we can fraud them to
invest in such a rats nest.

93
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,236
What about the contribution from EU?

94
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,399
We'll see what happens.

95
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,072
Börje!

96
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,469
Remember to talk to Molle about the
permit.

97
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:50,353
Listen now. When I was in Poland they invited
me on a hunting trip. I shot a wild boar.

98
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,069
When that polish tourist attaché arrives,
I have promised him a moose hunt.

99
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,389
What?

100
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,399
Ullabritten, no way! It's three weeks
before our hunting season starts.

101
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,632
Börje, we're trying to sell a tourist resort
that has been bankrupted four times.

102
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,754
And slowly is eaten by mould,
termites and bad bank loans.

103
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,555
But moose hunting is serious matters.

104
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,119
Who's in charge of that?

105
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,076
The County council of course.

106
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,189
I guess it's guarded by some nature
freak.

107
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,040
Who is the boss for the County
council?

108
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,439
Well... it's the County governor, of
course...

109
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,274
Börje, who is the County governor?

110
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,511
I am.

111
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,520
Then who's in charge of the moose
hunting?

112
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,673
Do you know someone who can find a
moose, Svante?

113
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,470
It was all about Jurek's younger sister.
She needed an eye surgery.

114
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,914
I had told Jurek that's an easy thing
in Sweden.

115
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,118
Lots of Polish doctors work in Sweden.
I know one that surely can help you.

116
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,113
Don't worry. We will take care of this,
I told him.

117
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,872
Well done, lads. The inspector was pleased.
Just some more nails in the roofbeams.

118
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,598
Have a look at this.

119
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,398
Beware of him. He's the head of the
construction board. Politician, politruk.

120
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,913
Hide if you see this guy or his car,
ok?

121
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,756
Now you can start working.

122
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,671
Nobody has died of a little rain.

123
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,314
Think about the money, boys.

124
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,113
What car was he driving?

125
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,111
A blue Volvo.

126
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,840
What the hell, it was a red Saab.
I told you...

127
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,080
Take it easy, Sedvallson.
GLH 231, red Saab...

128
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,995
You can't make jokes about
such a serious thing.

129
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,230
I get into trouble if they find you.

130
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,751
Maybe it's better if
you work in the night.

131
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,473
Think about the money, boys!

132
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,229
Ten thousand, he said.

133
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,549
Ten thousand, no receipt and he will
do the surgery.

134
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,756
Health care is free in Sweden.

135
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,798
Maybe for the swedes.

136
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,875
But this fucking doctor is polish.

137
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,715
And earning a good buck here in
Sweden.

138
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,956
What will happen if she don't
get that surgery?

139
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,799
She will be blind.

140
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,039
They say it will take half a year
and then she can't see anymore.

141
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,914
We finish this job and
you have the money.

142
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,433
Remember what he said:
"Think about the money, boys."

143
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,830
Maybe it's the inspector?

144
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,270
Politicians don't run around
in the forest at night.

145
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,319
This is Sweden.

146
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,278
Not even here they do.

147
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,232
Have you seen any moose?

148
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,875
Moose...elk?

149
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,755
Nail?

150
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,557
Both Sedvallson and Nadja were minor
buyers compared to the Berry king.

151
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:41,393
Wholesale dealer, owned the freeze house,
bribed the officials at the immigration office.

152
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,348
Take that once again.

153
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,000
My polish freezing company buy half
of the ski resort from the County council

154
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,150
And pay with shares in the company.

155
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,034
The County council will own half of my freezing business
and I will own half of their mouldering tourist resort.

156
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,068
If we estimate, each part has a
stock value of 25 millions

157
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,077
Then we can get 50 millions as EU
contribution for interregional co-operation.

158
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,400
Understand?

159
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,436
Yes.
Good.

160
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,596
The polish tourist association takes
care of the polish stock.

161
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,115
But...

162
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,278
...the swedish company need a
swindler.

163
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:39,240
Some one who signs the company papers and get
a 25 million dept when the company has been stripped.

164
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,753
Pretty much.

165
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,316
You'll take care of that, won't you
Svante?

166
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,752
You have to explain what you want
from me...

167
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,073
This is big business.
You can get a piece of the cake...

168
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,315
What should I do to get that
opportunity?

169
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,672
The Berry king is buying the ski
resort from the County council.

170
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,639
And pay with shares from the company.
Fifty, fifty, and then...

171
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,956
...it will be possible to raise the
same amount from the interregional EU-fund.

172
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,840
The higher price, the more you get.

173
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,279
And the polish company?

174
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,153
A junk yard, freon and poison.

175
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,709
Run, for God's sake!

176
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,839
And what's my part?

177
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,955
Signing the swedish firm taking over
the shares in the freeze company.

178
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,839
5% of the EU contribution. And a
grant that all the debts are taken care of.

179
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,712
5%! That would be millions. The only thing
you need to do is signing some papers.

180
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,276
Two?

181
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,791
Four.

182
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,475
Typical!

183
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,556
I'll see what I can do.

184
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,628
It really looks nice, Svante. Very
good job.

185
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,320
Just a little crack in the window
panel.

186
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,389
We will take care of that later.

187
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,074
Hello, and welcome!

188
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,558
Champagne for everyone. And for me of
course.

189
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,190
Come on!

190
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,350
These are the boys that helped me.
They are so skilled.

191
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,517
I need to get a refill. I'll be back
later.

192
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,789
The police! They stopped down at the road.
We must get out of here fast as hell.

193
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,469
You have the key.

194
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,390
You had it last, when you bought
nails.

195
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,677
I gave it to you.

196
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,956
I don't have any key.

197
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,000
Sedvallson was with them!

198
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,232
He was there with the police.
Showing them were are tent was.

199
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,873
I put in on the left front wheel.

200
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,233
We had been cheated. He always did
like that.

201
00:24:50,200 --> 00:25:01,111
When the job was done he reported you as illegal
workers. You had to leave without any payment.

202
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,034
Ullis sad that she paid him 80 000
for the job.

203
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,878
Ullis who?

204
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,711
The lady with the house, Ullabritten.
She paid him 80 000 for the job.

205
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,310
"Ullis"?

206
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,999
He offered us 10 000.

207
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,189
It doesn't matter.
Now he has cheated us anyway.

208
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,115
Hurry up!

209
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,631
Hello!

210
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,672
Seen anything?

211
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,194
Should it be a bull moose?

212
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,434
A big one. With huge horns that the
tourist clown can bring back to Poland.

213
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,673
Are you sure it's ok with
the County council?

214
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,078
Yes. It was the County governor
himself who gave the permit.

215
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,792
You know, there is millions in
EU contribution on stake.

216
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,910
What do you think?

217
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,194
Then we take one from the research centre,
they have radio transmitter. Easier to find.

218
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,871
You haven't seen any red polish car
around?

219
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,276
See you!

220
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,516
Could you follow me, please?

221
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,911
Do you need any help, darling?

222
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,593
No, I'm fine.

223
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,512
He owns us at least 40 000.

224
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,315
These are worth less than
the paper it's written on.

225
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,760
Shouldn't we buy them back?

226
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,990
We will sort it out with him later.

227
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,600
What the hell are you doing?
Are you insane?

228
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,240
Where the hell is our money?
You can't pay with only papers and stamps!

229
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,117
I will call the police!
POLICE, understand?

230
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,197
Just call the police then!

231
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,877
Then we will tell them.

232
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,674
Just call the police! Come on!
Let's push this crap down.

233
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,675
Come on! Let's go!

234
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,031
You will regret this!

235
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,395
The police! Yes, that's right...

236
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,838
We were lucky that you were out on
the road this early.

237
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,670
Have a taste.

238
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,029
I've put sugar in it,
I think it should be sweets for the sweet.

239
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,990
Little but tasty.

240
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,316
Nothing happens here.

241
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,711
Well, we're coming back soon.

242
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,155
Pet him!

243
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,518
He like women.

244
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,552
He can smell when they're near.
Horny like a baboon.

245
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,359
They are on their way.
Just passing Finnfallet.

246
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,473
Can you move the cart a little
forward?

247
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,192
Roadblock, reverse to the dirt road.

248
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,080
Do you need any more help?
I can follow you with the tractor?

249
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,958
You don't have to. Just move that
fucking pig.

250
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,235
Yes, yes.

251
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,508
Go away. We will take care of it.

252
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,153
Where is the key?

253
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,109
Damn it!

254
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
How much berries was it?

255
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,635
Many tons of berries, worth at least
100 000.

256
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:56,073
That's what happens if you try to be nice
and give them a chance to earn some money.

257
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,839
They haven't given up. They will be here
in ten minutes. We have to move on.

258
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,752
She will be blind. Where am I going
to find the money? You screw it all up.

259
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,475
We have to go on.

260
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,240
The police are after us. What are we
doing here Stefan?

261
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,189
Driving around in the forest like fools with a ton
of stolen blueberries in the middle of nowhere.

262
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,317
We can sell them to that Russian
buyer and then you'll have money to bribe that doc

263
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,798
You can't bribe anyone with thousand
litres of rotten blueberries.

264
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,028
How's your foot?

265
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,750
It hurts. We'll have to do something
about it.

266
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,756
How's it going, Geronimo?

267
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,636
They've been here. Someone stepped
in the blueberries.

268
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,234
Let's give up.

269
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,996
We better go back to the station. We just
get into trouble if we keep on working too much.

270
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,510
This is the bus, you can tell from
the wheelbase. The tires are smaller, you know.

271
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,390
Is it still warm?

272
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,556
Warm?

273
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,835
What are you talking about?

274
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,000
I better drive, maybe we can speed up
a bit.

275
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,151
What the hell, Jörgen! We have been
working since 4 am.

276
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,760
For christ's sake, Jörgen!

277
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,920
We were one millimitre from crashing
into that fucking moose.

278
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,480
Take it easy, it wasn't even close.

279
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,994
Let's quit. Stop. Finito!

280
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,118
What's your problem? Have you never
been in a car with a real rally driver?

281
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,276
Annika!

282
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:23,790
Annika, can you put up the warning
triangle? It may...

283
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,675
...someone might come...

284
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,392
Just for some fucking litres of
blueberries!

285
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,719
Is there any sign of life out in
space?

286
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,311
You haven't seen a moose by any
chance?

287
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,789
That damn Jörgen was two millimetres
from crashing into one just a moment ago.

288
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,840
A bull moose, with huge horns? Almost
black?

289
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,671
Something like that.

290
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,955
I'll drive.

291
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,440
Stop, it's your colleague!

292
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,749
He can walk home. Bloody idiot!

293
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,151
What a luck that you were here
Mäntyranta.

294
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,278
You can thank my stupid sister for picking you up.
I thought of leaving you as food for the wolves.

295
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,076
I understood we had to do something about
Jurek's foot so we went to the polish doctor.

296
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:40,757
If the police were after us we could explain
everything to him. At least he was polish.

297
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,037
I told you he would help you.

298
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,952
Did he say anything about your
sister's eye surgery?

299
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,312
He still wants ten thousand for putting
her on the waiting list.

300
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,510
He is an asshole, I know.

301
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,800
Stefan, you said we would earn money here in Swede
Pick blueberries and do carpentry.

302
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,950
Where shall I get the money?

303
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,752
I have to pay him ten grand for my sister
and twenty for the plaster.

304
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,558
Twenty thousand?

305
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,154
Otherwise he will report me to the
authority.

306
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,993
He must be crazy.

307
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,597
I have to pay him in a month, or
else...

308
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,999
Or else what?

309
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,915
He know some people who can break the
foot again.

310
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,194
How's your foot?

311
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,316
Not so good.

312
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,076
Listen.

313
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,029
Call that russian lady.

314
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,309
Yes, I know. I saw it on TV.

315
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,549
Stay were you are.
I will contact you tomorrow.

316
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,313
Have you seen Sedvallson?

317
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,910
I think he is with the other
boys in the sauna.

318
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,591
No. it's because they have such red
eyes...

319
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,513
Is it Rotary meeting?

320
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,998
Are you cold, boys?

321
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,428
Is Sedvallson here?

322
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,600
Not even in the sauna you can
be alone from the women.

323
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:44,357
Don't be silly Svante. You have to
leave DNA for the paternity case.

324
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,831
What do you want?

325
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,914
The moose has crossed the county
border.

326
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,960
Isn't there any other around?

327
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,272
Not with such big horns. Not with
transmitter.

328
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,231
Couldn't you call him back?

329
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,311
Empty. No one could live like this.

330
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,955
The papers are only a few days old.

331
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,508
I'll see if we can sleep on the
attic.

332
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,475
Hello!

333
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,149
Hey! Hello! Sorry if we bother you.

334
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,155
What did he say?

335
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,196
Where is Ivar?

336
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,879
There is a naked man in the potato
field.

337
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,230
Give me the blanket.

338
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,440
Is he weird?

339
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,839
Guess he is a bit crazy.

340
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,755
But no more than any one else
out here in the forest.

341
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,360
It's against the rheumatism.
It's great for the body.

342
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,590
The whole body...

343
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,593
Get on your horses!

344
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,270
He knows a few words in polish.

345
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,390
A lady from Ukraine or Belarus
stayed here a couple of years ago.

346
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,989
Could you bring get some blueberries?
I heard about you on the radio.

347
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,470
I'm the maid from the local
government.

348
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,960
It smelled of yeast. Something was
fermenting...

349
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,430
A top modern high-tec moonshine
factory in the crazy man's barn.

350
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,800
What is it?

351
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,676
Look!

352
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,955
They were transported to the airport were they
are waiting for a flight back to Thailand.

353
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,230
Soon this group will be sent out of the country.
As you can see there's a lot of emotions involved.

354
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,917
Where the stolen blueberries are
hidden is still a mystery.

355
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:22,231
That's right. We have to show those hooligans that
they can't come here and do anything they want.

356
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,798
Can I have some more?

357
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,554
Stop that, you old horny stud!
Keep quite about things you don't know.

358
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,240
They start with blueberries and cars.

359
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,552
Then money and antiques.

360
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,879
Robbing old people in the countryside.
I've read about in the papers.

361
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,075
It's only Mäntyranta.

362
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,840
Is Ivar at home?

363
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,550
Sorry. He happens to be at
the opening of the Opera tonight.

364
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,715
Later on it was a cocktail party at
the Spybar.

365
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,800
Heard that he's been naked the whole
week.

366
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,591
Is it Väinämöinens daughter, Marketta
with the red skirt?

367
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,717
Who wanted a man with a rapier.

368
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,355
One with a sword and one with money.

369
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:48,150
Wicked on his shoes came a villain
splashing in the mud and slush...

370
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,910
One that had to take what was left,
choose among what had been rejected.

371
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,118
Can I borrow the stilts?

372
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,714
Will it be inspection?

373
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,593
In the end of the week.

374
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,152
They are out in the barn.

375
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:10,760
One of the polish boys can help you.
What was that?

376
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,636
Kalevala.

377
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,113
Oh.. poetry reading?

378
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,433
We're training for a local play.
What are you going to do with the blueberries?

379
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,553
The russian lady are coming to get
them.

380
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,674
You can come with me if you want?

381
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,038
What's the point with this?

382
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,838
Compensation from the authority.

383
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,320
Didn't the moose eat enough this
year?

384
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,038
He didn't eat at all.

385
00:52:51,320 --> 00:53:00,149
The forest owners put out carrots
in the forest for the hunting season.

386
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,033
Quite! What was that?

387
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,556
He was just standing there watching
us.

388
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,909
Go away! Just let us do the whole job,
you non-loyal sucker.

389
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,918
Where have you been?

390
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,800
Picking up the new car.

391
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,437
Look!

392
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,715
Rolls with cheese...

393
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,550
And fresh Danish.

394
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,152
I kiss each millimetre of your skin.

395
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,230
Give you massage with etheric oils.

396
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,792
Rub you with my magic cat skin.

397
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,436
Chafe you naked in my
Granny's squirrel fur coat.

398
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,760
Give you a bath in milk and myrrh.

399
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,470
Brush your naked body with my marten
brush.

400
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:49,595
Stop that. I didn't write anything
about how you made a fool of yourself.

401
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,028
Get the coffee.

402
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,435
Here you are.

403
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,920
And then you can empty the dish washer,
clean the sewer at the shower room,

404
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,390
Bring the garbage out,
and clean the floor at the loo.

405
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,195
You forgot the milk in the coffee.

406
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,429
Oh, I'm sorry...

407
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,113
What was that you suggested
with the squirrel fur coat?

408
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,715
How's it going with the terrorist hunt?
Any new leads?

409
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,753
First, they are no terrorists.

410
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,880
They borrowed a car and took back some
blueberries they didn't get paid for.

411
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,035
That fucking Sedvallson cheated them
as always.

412
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,760
What would've happened if one of
the Tamils had killed himself?

413
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,911
Hung himself in his shoe laces?

414
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,235
They were Thai, not Tamils, and all
were sandals.

415
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,998
But I can give you a tip.

416
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,589
How much does it cost?

417
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:13,116
That is a later subject. But it might bring honour
and fame to your little narrow-minded world.

418
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,110
I know where they hide.

419
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,395
Who?

420
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,117
"The Blueberry terrorists."

421
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,198
Would you like to know?

422
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,114
How much?

423
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,559
Jörgen has a list of suitable bribes.

424
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,520
There was something about a squirrel
fur coat.

425
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,557
Can't you show him how to do it?

426
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,839
Where's Ivar?

427
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,158
Out in the potato field.

428
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,957
Too much rotten berries.
I can't use them.

429
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,679
What should we do with them?

430
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,029
Throw them away.

431
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,188
No that's me. He is the chemist.

432
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,673
Here I am.

433
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,670
I thought you were a farmer.

434
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,879
Guess I am in a way, but the money
comes from the University.

435
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,799
International economics.

436
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,108
Without books?

437
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,512
Easier this way. Doesn't collect as
much dust.

438
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,076
I have the password for almost
all archives on the net.

439
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,880
Ivar said you have a potato machine.

440
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,916
I don't know how it works.

441
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,838
Or if it can be used, but here it is.

442
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,474
Are you sure it was here?

443
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,676
Yes, she said so.

444
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,352
Let's look in the barn.

445
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,994
Stop, stay there!

446
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,796
Shit man, they must be crazy.

447
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,790
Those can't be legal?

448
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,115
I don't know.

449
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,589
The car seems to be in here.

450
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,716
Why are you whispering? Is it an old
VW bus?

451
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,913
Yes. Run the camera when I open the
door!

452
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,189
No, wait. Let's do it like this.
I open the door and you follow with the camera.

453
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,073
It can be problematic with the light,
but I'll try.

454
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,276
One, two, one, two... ok?

455
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,633
It's ok, I start the pan from the
junk yard, start talking at the harvester, ok?

456
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,909
Yes, yes, yes!

457
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,390
Ok, action.

458
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:47,000
We got an anonymous tip that they were hiding
here. A deserted farm far out in the forest.

459
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,360
We haven't found anything so far,
they might have continued already.

460
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:59,833
But it seems like they have left one
of the stolen cars. Let's have a look...

461
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,233
Oh, what the fuck!

462
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,640
Great, what a take!

463
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,915
Stop filming and help me get down.

464
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,077
I have a fucking pike trap in my
hand.

465
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,760
It's some sort of elevator. I haven't
the slightest idea how it works. Here!

466
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,239
Hurry up!

467
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,438
Put something under.

468
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,909
Help me down, God damn it!

469
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,918
What the fuck!

470
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,509
My nails like burn from viper.

471
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,868
My palms as poison snake.

472
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,911
I raise a fence of iron...

473
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,679
...around my simple house.

474
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,272
Tied up with viper roap...

475
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,639
...wicker braided out of lizards.

476
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,318
He must be crazy!

477
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,912
Must have escaped from a mental
institution.

478
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,710
The tripod!

479
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,832
Don't bother, just drive!

480
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,639
What a take. Cool!

481
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,877
If that rope would've taken my neck,
I would've been dead right now.

482
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,390
"Wicker braided out of lizards."

483
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,833
Did you see any blueberries?

484
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:20,278
I can help you sharpen the knifes, boys.
You'll have potato flour enough.

485
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,920
I'll bee back tonight to see how you
manage.

486
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,594
Thank you.

487
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,434
Be careful with the knifes,
they can easily cut off a finger.

488
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,718
Wouldn't it have been easier
to buy it?

489
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,358
Can you buy potato flour in the
store?

490
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,396
Of course.

491
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,438
But Ivar said you have to do like
this.

492
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,039
He just fools you around.

493
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,438
He only wanted to know if it works.

494
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,511
And make a painting of it.

495
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,513
We used to do like this when I was a
kid.

496
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,356
When it dries you become white.

497
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,153
Have you understood that it's
just a scam?

498
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,233
Ryszard said it's just a bookkeeping
issue.

499
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,473
You'll have a 25 million debt
when they've robbed the company.

500
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,229
But still you've signed
for the swedish company?

501
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,910
I take the chance.

502
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,553
If we can keep our companies going,
we can take in on them.

503
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,718
But we have to co-operate.
Are you with me?

504
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:35,113
I just thought this business was an excuse
for Ryzsard to fuck that swedish bimbo.

505
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,759
It might be that way.

506
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,718
But why couldn't we take advantage
of the situation?

507
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,479
Hohoo, anyone at home?

508
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,033
You got it started!
We did the same when we were kids.

509
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,829
Where's Ivar?

510
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,515
In the potato field.

511
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,395
I spoke to Fors. He will be here at 2
am.

512
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:32,796
The russian lady and Jurek were up to something.
They made tests and some chemical analysis.

513
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:42,509
I didn't know their plans but we needed money
to pay for the plaster and the eye surgery.

514
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,398
This is also some kind of life.

515
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:04,759
It's a life for the leftovers.
Those who can't live among normal people.

516
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,308
A mix of wackos and witches.

517
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,235
How much?

518
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,799
Two or three cubic metre.

519
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,953
Do you know were his place is?

520
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,439
Yes, no problems.

521
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,594
Hi Ivar, are you awake in
the middle of the night?

522
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,873
Production development. Damn!

523
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,751
Damn!

524
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:27,113
Be blessed noble maiden, divinity
of early morning haze. Golden Diana...

525
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,310
...with the deadly weapon
resting in your soft hands.

526
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,952
Stop the fuzz, Ivar. Are you going to
help us call for the moose?

527
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,640
Mäntyranta suggests that you wait
at the lookout.

528
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,196
Darling, I'll wait in the car.

529
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,713
Dear Madame.

530
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,389
Come with me. An early walk in the
forest.

531
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:13,517
The freshness of the dew, the satiation
of the air will make your blood rush

532
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:22,792
Colour your cheek and sharpen your
emotions.

533
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,351
The fields, the forests and us.

534
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,476
Sure Franciszca darling. Just follow
Tarzan's grandpa tracking down the wild animals.

535
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,156
Shut up!

536
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,150
No. Not a single hit.
We could keep doing this all day.

537
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:59,592
Hello. Alright, he passed.

538
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,671
Stop filming and help me get down.

539
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,558
I have a fucking pike trap in my
hand.

540
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:16,714
What do you think? Is it use of a
deadly weapon or preventing journalistic works?

541
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,079
You are watching to much TV.

542
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,389
If that rope would've reached my neck
I could've been strangled.

543
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,028
You shouldn't have been there.
It's his private area.

544
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,713
You weren't doing anything so we
wanted to reveal where they were hiding.

545
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,508
We don't need any help. We know
where they are hiding.

546
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,749
And still you don't do anything?

547
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,032
The berries are back. There's no
case.

548
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,590
The local police has informed us that
the case...

549
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,951
The case with the stolen...

550
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,635
The affair with the stolen
blueberries is dismissed.

551
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,280
We've heard that all the berries
were delivered this morning and...

552
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,679
What did you say that the police had
said?

553
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:02,430
I spoke to that police chick, you know.
She said the berries were back.

554
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,589
I haven't seen any. They must be
rotten now anyway.

555
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,513
Here are lots of them.

556
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,156
That is what I bought yesterday.

557
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,430
Are we going to do anything?

558
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,510
No you're not. I can give you some
coffee.

559
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,879
You can pack up.

560
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,715
Stop! Don't open!

561
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,388
I think I can help you with
a very special story.

562
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,272
Did the guy with the milk tank work
it out?

563
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:38,071
Yes, I think so. He filled up
through the ventilation tube. Great.

564
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,632
Is it spelled like this, Medyczny
Uni...?

565
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,877
Remove the S and write C and Z.

566
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,879
Excuse me.

567
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,035
How many do you need?
I think I have twenty-four...

568
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,989
I think he is on the right track. He
have to hurry up.

569
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:33,234
We are right in the scent.
If he catch our scent, he might turn.

570
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,435
We better swim to that island. Hurry
up!

571
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,677
He is just behind those pine bushes.

572
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:05,755
That was the ruttish call, he might get angry
when he finds out that we cheated him.

573
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,470
What the...?

574
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,910
You better hurry up!

575
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,880
We've checked the bookkeeping
for the tourist resort.

576
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,873
And right now there is a bank and a
construction company demanding millions.

577
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:06,040
If the loan is not paid next month the bank
will bankrupt the whole place.

578
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,430
There is no problem, we have a solid
buyer...

579
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,469
The health authority has condemned
the kitchen

580
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,311
Was that a ruttish call?

581
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,671
No, it was just a mating call.

582
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,994
What's the difference?

583
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,069
You can tell from the words.

584
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,390
And all that about the scent?

585
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,035
It was a bluff, to allure you
to come with me here.

586
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:52,149
We didn't even ask what it would be good for.
We just carried those frozen sheep down the sloop.

587
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,834
We had picked them up at the cold storage
of the Berry king.

588
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:56,720
They are getting a bit old. Try to get
the inspection as fast as possible.

589
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,952
They are getting a bit old. Try to
get the inspection as fast as possible.

590
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,838
I'll call them tonight,
then they'll be here tomorrow.

591
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,710
They want them on the Norwegian side
next week.

592
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,918
Are you cold? In the middle of the
summer?

593
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,478
Do you have marks and tong?

594
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,158
What is she going to do with them?

595
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,069
The "Wolf damage fund".

596
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,075
What do you earn from it?

597
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,749
15%. Normal tax.

598
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,556
What are you doing?

599
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:04,196
A wolf. A real wolf. First time I've
seen one.

600
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,239
Now you're in a fine mess!

601
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,874
Excuse me, there's a limit.

602
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,877
That polish tourist clown wounded
that fucking moose.

603
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:20,836
What moose?

604
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,480
The one you permitted Ullabritten to
shoot.

605
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,154
I haven't given any permit. There
must be some misunderstanding.

606
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,192
The TV-crew videotaped the whole
thing.

607
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,752
That reporter has been trough the
bookkeeping.

608
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:39,111
They know the whole fix with the
company and the EU contribution.

609
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:44,475
You'll take care of this in a proper way,
do you understand?

610
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,954
And tell Ullabritten to start
thinking with her head.

611
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:55,516
And also make sure they quit my
options in that company, right now!

612
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,359
The polish blueberry thieves filled
my camper with blueberry jam.

613
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,433
Don't you have any sense of humour?

614
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,276
Humour? It was five ton blueberries
worth 14 SEK per kilo.

615
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,992
You've never paid. At least you have
the jam.

616
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,836
Yes, thanks! Fine. Thank you, bye!

617
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:44,039
It's obvious. Both the swedish tourist resort
and the polish freeze factory are fake.

618
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,839
The board in both companies has
bought options

619
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,112
So they can put the money from EU
in their own pockets.

620
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:55,591
This is your business manager.

621
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:16,000
These pictures should absolutely not
be shown. I know Janne.

622
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,030
I'll talk to your boss!
Janne and me are really close. Get lost!

623
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:28,430
The County governor is coming, you can talk to him
Believe me, they are on the wrong track.

624
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:33,555
They told me they just would check some
information about the local companies.

625
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,233
You are chief for the news desk.
You are responsible for everything you broadcast.

626
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:42,677
It is a matter of hundreds of jobs in
the region.

627
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,118
Wolfs! There are wolfs out in the jogging track.
Totally crazy! They were going for Börje.

628
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,239
I think they took him!

629
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,675
Oh my God!

630
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,230
For the constitut... constutit...,
hat the hell!

631
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,676
Constituent assembly.

632
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,872
A toast for..

633
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,473
Wait, wait...

634
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:31,197
A toast for the board in
the vodka company Sagolandet.

635
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,189
Wait a minute.

636
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,916
You did a great job with the company.
We have a special gift for you.

637
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,594
Great work!

638
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,117
Let's make that toast.

639
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,551
To Jerzy and Sagolandet.

640
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,080
I hope you understand that I can't
make any public comments

641
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,920
Before we've had a closer look
at this information.

642
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,240
When do you think...?

643
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,835
Impossible to say. I will contact
you.

644
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,193
You don't think...?

645
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,037
And this is the complete material?

646
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,152
Superintendent Brandtzek.

647
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,200
They think the County governor has
been killed by a pack of wolfs.

648
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,350
Up in the illuminated track at the
tourist resort.

649
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,589
Don't be hysterical Ullabritten.

650
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,030
It's a natural step in the food
chain.

651
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,519
Instead you should delete my name
from that options list.

652
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,720
Did you hear about the County
governor?

653
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,709
Yes, it's insane.

654
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,558
Father! Look what I found in the
illuminated track, can I keep it?

655
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,473
What are you doing here?

656
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,278
They think he surprised the wolf pack eating booty
a wounded animal or something.

657
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,640
It must bee that moose the tourist
boss shot.

658
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,920
What moose?

659
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,160
We've got it on tape when he shot it.

660
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:52,914
He and that lady from the EU-office.

661
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,435
Ullabritten!

662
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,520
We have decided to wait with
broadcasting that material.

663
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,160
It's a lot of jobs. You know how it
is...

664
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,550
When the contract is signed, you can
have as much information as you want.

665
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:12,637
Do you think the poles would buy a resort
were wolfs eat people in the illuminated track?

666
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,508
Could you...?

667
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,670
Not even think about it.

668
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,992
Another thing, what about those
options?

669
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,238
How many did you sign for?

670
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:31,518
Three thousand. You'll cancel them,
right?

671
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,548
You know that I always try to help
you.

672
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:48,399
The polish tourist attaché wounded the moose,
and it fell on the illuminated track.

673
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:55,840
Then the County governor comes jogging
right into the pack eating the carcass.

674
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,917
So they had him as a starter...

675
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,872
Or main course maybe.

676
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,477
How many bottles do we have?

677
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,314
25-30 litres I think.

678
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,918
What are you aiming at?

679
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,994
Will there be many journalists reporting
about the eaten County governor?

680
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,949
TV will drag down all extreme hunters and
wild animal freaks and broadcast for weeks.

681
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,196
This is our big chance!

682
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,591
Is it true that you get blue teeth?

683
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,117
Ivar says it goes away in a couple of
days.

684
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:36,474
Have you thought about that you
and I together own all the shares.

685
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:46,669
If we can avoid the bankruptcy, we can
get the whole EU contribution.

686
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,356
Should we take the money or invest
them?

687
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,715
Maybe this company, Sagolandet, would
do.

688
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,399
Why not. They seem to be particular
potent.

689
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,555
You mean potential?

690
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,472
That as well.

691
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,992
That company was a failure.

692
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,469
Not so bad. I make a purchase on
that new company.

693
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,639
But all the blueberries?

694
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,400
Much better when you can
use them in a proper way.

695
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,549
What do you mean?

696
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,960
I buy better and cheaper berries from
Russia.

697
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,720
But I have to buy 10% swedish berries to
print "Swedish Berries" on the jar.

698
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:49,876
So I buy 10% and bring them to the dump.
Now you can make vodka from them.

699
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,033
I love you.

700
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,518
What does the formula mean?

701
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,353
50 million. Probably more.

702
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,670
We sent the blueberry vodka to Kiev
for an analyze.

703
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:42,272
Everybody I know in Ukraine would drink
the vodka and don't care about the analyze.

704
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,834
Not this guy.

705
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,912
Becoming Nobel prize-winner.

706
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:54,713
He found out that this type of alcohol extracts
the same substance as they use in medicine.

707
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,358
It's only in the scandinavian
blueberries.

708
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:03,751
An Italian company sells such medicine
for hundred million a year.

709
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,435
Euro.

710
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,952
Then we have a gold mine out in the
old barn.

711
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,949
It's about my sisters eye.
When can she have her surgery?

712
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,719
What is this?

713
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,309
A copy of your exam at the medical
school.

714
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,279
If you look at the bottom of the first page.
It says 'Not approved'.

715
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,356
That line is missing in the papers
at the hospital archive.

716
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,358
Where did you get this paper?

717
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,876
I know someone who's good at
searching the web.

718
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,475
Will September 18th be ok?

719
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,269
That will do.

720
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:32,471
...that the company Sagolandet is given
exclusive right selling liquor...

721
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:36,713
...at the new reconstructed
tourist resort Vargklämman

722
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:43,560
...and that Sedvallsons bär have the obligation
to deliver 10 tons of blueberry each year

723
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,710
...at the lowest daily price.

724
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,989
Didn't the police wreck that
investigation?

725
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:01,190
Maybe you want to see the tape where
the police chief receive the material?

726
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,229
Don't bother!

727
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:19,159
It's a good start at my new job as
a County governor to inaugurate a project

728
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:25,960
Where local production and industrial
innovation can work together

729
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,996
In an international and
interregional investment.

730
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,917
This is just the kind of spirit
I've worked on in Brussels.

731
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,114
I know you need it out here.. out
here in...

732
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,514
The bush!

733
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,716
...in the thinly populated area.

734
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:53,999
Good luck and congratulations to the biggest
EU contribution ever paid to this region.

735
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,957
Who is that guy next to the russian?

736
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,758
New business partner.

737
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,238
Drug company from Milan.

738
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,837
I'm taking a group picture.

739
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:29,198
OK, here we go. Are you ready?
Cheers.

740
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,677
No, I don't know what's wrong with the car.
I'll be late.

741
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,635
Somebody else could go there and cut the ribbon.
I don't know when I'll be back.

742
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,718
No problem.

743
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,836
Ain't the factory owners coming down
for some coffee?

744
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,077
A strange country.

745
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,879
A Sagoland.

746
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,593
No problems. No problems.
