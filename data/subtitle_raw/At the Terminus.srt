ONE SPRING DAY...

25
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,391
We're at the terminal, gentlemen.
It is time to get off.

26
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,549
Hey, we're at the terminal, sir.

27
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,878
Where are we?
- At the end, old chap.

28
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,640
The terminal. You know what
a loop is, don't you?

29
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,117
Yeah... a loop.

30
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,399
Do you know why I came here?
- I certainly don't.

31
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,632
Get out of my way, you soak!
- Shut up, you fool!

32
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,071
Make sure you get to work on time,
slogger!

33
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,830
Good morning. I can wait.
- Good morning, I'll be right back.

34
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,794
Here it is. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

35
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,193
A glass of hot grog for me, boss!

36
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,674
Lay off!
- Come on, don't be so fussy.

37
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,639
Milk is healthy
but for kids, you see?

38
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,510
I've got a little girl, too.

39
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,119
You didn't know
I came here for a visit, did you?

40
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,439
Knock it off!
- Did you, sucker? You...

41
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,997
You know nothing at all
but I do!

42
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,511
You sure do.
- I know it all.

43
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,671
Morning.
- Good morning.

44
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,712
Why are you staring at me?!

45
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,957
Good morning, Mother.
- Good morning.

46
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,358
You're drunk again.
What do you want?

47
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,435
I came to see you.

48
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,960
And I came to see my little Hana.
- Is that so?

49
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,640
What do you want?

50
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,480
My life is miserable. You know?

51
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,554
I can't be alone.
- You can't be alone, eh?

52
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,270
You were never home
when your wife was still alive.

53
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,716
Let Hanka live with me, Mother.

54
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,916
I'm her father, aren't I?
- You've never deserved it.

55
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,794
A child needs care and order
and no man can provide that.

56
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,196
No man.
And you the least!

57
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,672
You think I'm bad, don't you?

58
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,996
Go now and get some sleep!

59
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,880
You've never liked me!
You... you..

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,357
Don't close the door!

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,994
You old hag!
Damned old hag!

62
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,477
Let me in!
My kid is in there!

63
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,514
Put the kettle on, Zuzana!

64
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,789
Wait. Don't go there.

65
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,358
Do you hear that?
He's always raising the roof.

66
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,718
Your son-in-law, huh?

67
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,754
I'd teach him a lesson,
if it wasn't for my heart...

68
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,714
I can see you! Do you hear me?!

69
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,118
His drinking drove my poor daughter
to the grave.

70
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,120
Not once did he visit her in hospital.
He said couldn't stand hospitals.

71
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,432
And now that scoundrel
wants my granddaughter.

72
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,515
Just look at her.
She's just like her mother.

73
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,356
I will never give her to him.
Never.

74
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,071
I'm going downstairs, Mrs. Mala.

75
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,353
Go away!
Go! Shoo!

76
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,155
Don't run. Come here.

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,911
Come on!

78
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,953
Be human a little, doggy.

79
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,834
Come here!
Stop barking!

80
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,595
Don't bark at me!

81
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,549
You're making quite a scene
again, Mr. Pesta.

82
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,434
Why?
- Isn't the bakery working today?

83
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,479
The bakery? It is...

84
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,713
It is working today.
- Then what are you doing here?

85
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,710
Well, you know...
the baker's baking buns,

86
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,551
nibbling some,
the bakeress is helping him...

87
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,754
Baloney! She isn't helping him!
Nobody's helping me either!

88
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,560
And as I have baked so I must eat.

89
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
How about getting some sleep instead?

90
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,955
With you, miss?
I'd...

91
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,840
If you allow me...

92
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,394
You're quite hot tempered, huh?

93
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
Hurry up, Mr. Pesta,
or you'll miss the tram.

94
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,994
You're right. Men are bastards.

95
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,392
Not me, though!
Not me! Understand?

96
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,233
Good morning.
Two sour and two poppy.

97
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,955
Good morning.
Two sour and two poppy.

98
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,631
You've got courage, Miss Olga.

99
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,480
Mr. Brzobohaty here wanted
to run to your rescue.

100
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,910
You're exaggerating, Mrs. Volfova.

101
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,672
When I had noticed him on the tram,
I knew he'd cause trouble again.

102
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,276
It's all because of morals.

103
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,074
And, I beg your pardon, accumulation.

104
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,633
One more, Mrs. Volfova.
- Another one?

105
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,838
Yes, one more, please.

106
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,596
After a night shift,
Mr. Brzobohaty?

107
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,996
I'm always after a night shift.
You know how it goes...

108
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,715
Newspapers have to come out
every morning.

109
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
May I offer you today's paper?

110
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,749
You're most kind
but I wouldn't have time to read it.

111
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,553
Two bottles, please. For the last time.
- I beg your pardon.

112
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,837
So it is for the last time after all?

113
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,554
Have you heard, Mr. Brzobohaty,
that Miss Olga's sister got married?

114
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,472
To India, am I right?
- To Indonesia.

115
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,674
I've heard he's a big shot.
- Oh no, he's just a purchasing clerk.

116
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,599
But it makes no difference, does it?

117
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,314
I've never travelled further
than to Moravia.

118
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,114
And what about you, Miss Olga?

119
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,239
With men, you have to know the tricks,
don't you? It's pure science.

120
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,473
Like national defence education, eh?
They ought to teach it at school.

121
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,157
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Miss Olga.

122
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,640
You won't finish your milk?
- It's too much for my stomach.

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,517
Thank you. -Goodbye.
- Goodbye. -Goodbye, Mr. Brzobohaty.

124
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,793
An old tree and young sap.

125
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,912
We'll sweep the pavement.
- And then?

126
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,277
Then we'll clean the stairs.
- And then?

127
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,597
We'll hang the laundry in the attic.
- And then?

128
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,273
Then we will go shopping.

129
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,310
And then?
- We'll make lunch.

130
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,517
And then?

131
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,793
Then...
- What then?

132
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,152
Live well, Mrs. Mala, here's the key.
I won't forget it any more.

133
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,550
When are you coming back?
- Hana will be a big girl by then.

134
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,040
Hurry up.
- I'm coming!

135
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,480
Keep an eye on Olga for me, will you?
She knows nothing about life at all.

136
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,354
She's a sensible girl.
- That worries me even more.

137
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,794
Goodbye! Oh, my luggage!
- Good luck.

138
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,799
Goodbye!
- Hanicka!

139
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,995
Thanks.
- Good luck and don't forget to write!

140
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,880
And you take care of yourself. Bye!

141
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,393
Bye! And don't open the door to anyone!

142
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,915
Are you sad, Olga?

143
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,551
I don't know.

144
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,151
You're lucky you're still single.
- Olga!

145
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,240
I'll clean the stairs.
- Good girl.

146
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,552
You should've left it there for another
day. You wouldn't feel so lonely.

147
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,440
I don't like pretending.
What's gone is gone.

148
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,437
I have two names on my door for 4 years
and it isn't true either.

149
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,953
That's something different.

150
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,559
Isn't it strange?
We hardly know each other.

151
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,276
I wouldn't worry about that.
It must be because we are neighbours.

152
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,075
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

153
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,116
Good morning. - Off to work?
- As usual.

154
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,871
The postman had a registered letter
for you the other day. - I know.

155
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,119
Any news?
- Not much.

156
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,314
And what about your husband?
Have you seen him?

157
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,794
There'll be a court hearing soon.
They didn't know much back then.

158
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,520
Your husband will come back.
I'm certain.

159
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,833
Write him to stop by.
That I have slivovitz from Moravia.

160
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,390
Let's hope they'll fix the lift by then.

161
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,799
Good day.
- Good morning.

162
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,676
Nothing doing. He won't stop by.

163
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,716
Go away! Hurry up!
- Let's go.

164
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,391
What did you want, Hanicka?
I'm on my way out.

165
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,957
He's ringing the door bell. - Who?
- Some man. - Where? - There.

166
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,153
Do you know if anyone's in?

167
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,997
I beg your pardon. I'm Karel Martinec,
master of pharmacy.

168
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,278
And... I'm supposed to live here
from today.

169
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,038
They're not answering the door,
are they? - I'm afraid so.

170
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,440
You'll have to wait. They must have gone
shopping and will come home soon.

171
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,235
But I only have an hour or so.
I need to go to work, you see?

172
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,715
You're a pretty girl.
Come here.

173
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,196
What's your name?
Is it your only child?

174
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,519
Oh no, I've got four more at home.

175
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,831
You're a worthy mother indeed!
- I beg your pardon?!

176
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,197
Oh no, I'm very fond of children.
I really am.

177
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,591
I should be going.

178
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,272
Do you know where I could...

179
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,752
Are these two trunks all you have?
- A lamp.

180
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,071
Give it to me. -Are you angry at me?
- Not at all. - Careful.

181
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,797
We'll put it in my flat. Hurry, though,
I'm late for school.

182
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,073
Wait for us!

183
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,594
Hurry up! Come on!

184
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:27,359
Infrequency increases word emotionality
as may be demonstrated quite easily.

185
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,479
In Czech, the voiceless
labiodental consonant "f"

186
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,193
may only be found in borrowings...

187
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,633
We're not doing it for the money,
my husband earns enough.

188
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,636
Our evenings are somewhat sad, though.

189
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,277
We've told each other everything
in the twenty years of our marriage.

190
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,874
Here's the bathroom.

191
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,314
You can wash as you please.
We live here.

192
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,240
And this is your room.

193
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,110
I didn't expect you so early.
The floor's still wet.

194
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,275
Your husband didn't mention any child.
- I beg your pardon?

195
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,152
What about the baby cot?
- Oh no. I use it to store the blankets.

196
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,115
We don't have any children, you see?

197
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,040
We bought it long ago.

198
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,839
I was with child but I lost it
and we kept the baby cot.

199
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,914
We can put it in the hall, if you want.

200
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,632
Are there no hangers?
- I'll put them there.

201
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,877
And what about breakfast?
- I can make it for you.

202
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,750
Will they deliver your things?
- No, all my things are here.

203
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,111
Oh, our new neighbour. You've come
for your luggage, haven't you?

204
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,995
I'll fetch them for you. - Let me do it.
I can't let you carry my luggage.

205
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,995
Well, well!

206
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,311
Forgive me for being a little curious.

207
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,311
The lamp got unwrapped so I...
- It's all right.

208
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,036
It looks nice here,
as if made for your flat.

209
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,554
You know, I believe you can't put
a lamp just anywhere.

210
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,677
You have to find the right place
and plant it like a tree.

211
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,040
Only people keep moving all the time.

212
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,079
And their lamps with them?
- And their lamps with them.

213
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,556
I'll wrap it for you.
- No, please don't.

214
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,360
At least I don't feel as such
a stranger here.

215
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,989
Why don't you sit down for a cup
of coffee? The kettle is on. - Thanks.

216
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,478
This is my tenth rented room. A jubilee.

217
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,839
Poor lamp.

218
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,717
How many cubes?
- Two, please.

219
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,593
Quite frankly, I don't like moving
from place to place at all.

220
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,391
It's just that sometimes I get a strange
feeling that everything is too ordinary.

221
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,999
My landlady, the grandpa in the picture,
the carpets and wallpapers.

222
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,074
I suddenly feel so desperate...

223
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,155
...and I tell myself: "Maybe something
will happen if you go elsewhere."

224
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,394
And what should happen?
- Something.

225
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,319
I don't know.
You're too pragmatic, miss.

226
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,957
Why? I'd only like to know what you
expect from your new lodging.

227
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,229
Nothing.

228
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,715
I have a feeling
as though I've been here before.

229
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,914
Although...

230
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,596
...I've never lived at a tram terminal.

231
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,839
Doesn't this place seem like
the end of the world to you?

232
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,591
Why the end?
The world begins here for me.

233
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,515
Do you know you can see
Prague Castle from here?

234
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,273
Which way is it?
- This way.

235
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,950
And that way, you can see the woods
with binoculars in daylight.

236
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,676
Really?
- Yes, real woods.

237
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,955
I hope you're not doing this too often.
Young ladies shouldn't do such things.

238
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,993
Why?
I like watching people.

239
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,830
When they are getting off the tram.

240
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,835
I pick a person and talk to him.

241
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,558
I ask him: "Where are you going?"

242
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,120
And he walks on without answering.

243
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,111
I ask him: "Where are you carrying
the pictures? Are you a painter?"

244
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,355
And he goes on without a word.

245
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,394
Until he vanishes out of sight
and someone else appears.

246
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,915
You know...

247
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,275
I sometimes play like that
when I'm alone.

248
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,950
And you've cut yourself
while shaving today.

249
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,479
Where were you in such a hurry?
- For my luggage.

250
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,795
You can learn a moral lesson
from that, miss.

251
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,791
Don't look at people with a magnifying
glass or you'll see their freckles.

252
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,550
I can also look at you
the other way around.

253
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,072
You're this tiny now.

254
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,072
You don't believe me?
See for yourself.

255
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,119
I want to see you up close.

256
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,196
I can almost touch you now.

257
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,552
Wait, don't shy away.
Wait.

258
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,394
Well, it was a pleasant evening.

259
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,315
But I should be going.

260
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,235
You've been most kind.

261
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,591
Oh my, what have I done.
- I'll go and switch on the light.

262
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,916
Your lamp!

263
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,475
It was my fault.

264
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,435
Watch out for those splinters.

265
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,277
I'll turn the light on.

266
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,315
ONE SUMMER DAY...

267
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,237
Good evening. -Good evening.
Your paper's upstairs. - Oh yes, thanks.

268
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,480
Hana, dinner is ready!

269
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,716
It's so hot today.
- Good evening. - Hello.

270
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,069
Towel!
- Hop!

271
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,918
How are you, sweetheart?

272
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,274
Men aren't human...

273
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,757
I'm hungry, woman!
- It's almost ready!

274
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,558
Shoo!

275
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,430
What does his lordship wish?
- Something for starters.

276
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,313
Only if you like me, though.
- I do.

277
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,680
All so sudden?
- Yes, all so sudden.

278
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,035
Stop it.

279
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,433
They've deducted 10 crowns
from my salary today.

280
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,475
It's the second time they've done it
without a reason.

281
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,679
Why trouble yourself
with such things if I love you?

282
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,160
It's easy for you to say.
It's not your salary, is it?

283
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,079
It's no use sweating away, Olga

284
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,280
I used to be just like you.

285
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,433
And today... the pharmacy, the canteen,
beef roll, and meetings.

286
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,880
Comrade Martinec hasn't paid
his membership fees.

287
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,438
Why did you study pharmacy then?
- I'd like to know myself.

288
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,719
My father had a chemist's shop
and I was to raise it to a pharmacy.

289
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,751
They published my poem when I was
a 6th year grammar school student.

290
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,959
My Czech teacher used to tell me:
"Continue, son, don't give up."

291
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,353
And now I eat their soup
and live in a God-forsaken place.

292
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,079
Three months ago,
it seemed like a nice place to you.

293
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,157
Never mind.
If only...

294
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,153
If only...

295
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,433
If only one always had
such expectations.

296
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,159
Olga, come here.
- What is it?

297
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,669
What did her husband do?
- I don't know.

298
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,350
Something in the factory.
A new investigation will start soon.

299
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,756
How many years did he get?
- Many.

300
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,520
But those who know him
stand up for him.

301
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,873
It's no use for him, is it?
Nobody will miss him in a year.

302
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,158
Would you be faithful to me?
- Hardly. Come.

303
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,435
She's not like that.
- I see.

304
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,280
Blonds are luckier as they say.

305
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,510
And brunettes are more passionate.
- Let go.

306
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,954
Heavens! I didn't say that much.

307
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,158
Nothing ever surprises me
and I never judge anyone.

308
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,277
Maruna!

309
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,640
I must be off. Thank you.

310
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,195
No! Don't.

311
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,676
Go home now.

312
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,593
What a pity!
It's my evening off tonight.

313
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,039
You ought to take a long walk.

314
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,511
I can't. It's not right.

315
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,230
Seeing you once in a while
is enough for me. - But not for me.

316
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,359
Good night.

317
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,113
Are you all right?
- It's stuffy.

318
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,236
Have a nice Sunday.
- Good night. -Good night.

319
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,955
Yes?

320
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,993
May I come up? Just for a moment.

321
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,638
Do you hear me?
Answer me, Maruna!

322
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,353
Good morning.

323
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,520
Miserable life.

324
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,638
They should ban Sunday shifts.

325
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,680
I've had a dream
and I can't remember it now.

326
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:29,673
Listen, stranger.
I've got news for you.

327
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,833
We're going to have a baby.

328
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,398
Well I never!

329
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,510
Is it certain?

330
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,719
It isn't just wishful thinking, is it?

331
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,670
If only I didn't have to get up
so early.

332
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,353
What are you doing here?
- I'm the door-keeper. -Are you?

333
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,872
And what's your grandma doing?
- She's asleep.

334
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,111
She's asleep?
- She's sitting there without moving.

335
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,311
She isn't moving?
- No, she isn't.

336
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,391
Mrs. Mala. Are you all right?!

337
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,959
Mrs. Mala!

338
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,240
Maybe she could stay with us.
She can't be alone.

339
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,116
She has a father, doesn't she?
We could take her to him.

340
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,274
Did anybody let Pesta know at all?
- I don't know.

341
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,509
Olga! Olga!

342
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,800
No matter what you may think,

343
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,717
it's like reaching the tram terminal.

344
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,239
Pesta? Waiting for him would be
a waste of time. -Goodbye.

345
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,990
You really don't know
when he's coming home?

346
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,995
Only God knows.

347
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,996
Come, sweetie.

348
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,356
Quiet! Can't you give us peace
on Sunday at least?!

349
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,995
Who is supposed to listen
to that roaring all week long?!

350
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,078
Thank you. - You're welcome.
- I'll be right with you, Olga.

351
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,157
Just a moment. Export or ordinary?
- Export.

352
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,157
Good day.

353
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,430
30 crowns, please.

354
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,154
Go and sit down, Hanicka.

355
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,474
Thank you.

356
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,439
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

357
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,992
He wasn't home at all.
- Who wasn't home?

358
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,436
He'll have to come home sooner or later.

359
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,355
Here, have this chocolate.
It's full of vitamins.

360
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,994
I've heard he's seeing some widow.

361
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,072
I've got something for you, too.
Something good for you.

362
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,874
What is it? Vitamins?

363
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,669
Take it. It will help you.

364
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,234
Agomensin...
- It's hard to get. You see?

365
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,079
What's it for?
- Don't be naive.

366
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,513
Do you need directions for use?
- I surely don't.

367
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,713
Let's not...
Not in front of her.

368
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,913
I'd really like to go out tonight.
Somewhere with good food and music.

369
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,719
Where you can let
all your troubles go away.

370
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,514
Come to think of it,
we didn't even have a proper date.

371
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,560
Good day.
- Good day.

372
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,510
Go now.

373
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,756
May I help you?
- Yes, please.

374
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,273
Bye.

375
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,239
Do you dance like this with other women?
- No. Differently.

376
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,840
Doctor Ruzicka is asked to the phone!

377
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,517
Doctor Ruzicka is asked to the phone!
Box No. 2.

378
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,678
This place seems like
a small railway station.

379
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,154
The train will be here any minute
and cover everything with steam.

380
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,552
Where are you going? You're waiting
for the Blue Express, aren't you?

381
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,709
No, second class in a passenger train
is good enough for me, sir.

382
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,440
I'd only like a place by the window.
- With a view of the terminal?

383
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,280
With a view of you.

384
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,797
We have to come here more often
after we get married.

385
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,832
Are you proposing to me?

386
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,954
Are you surprised?
- No. Not at all.

387
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,317
Waiter! -Yes, sir?
- What finer red wines do you have?

388
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,229
Pomar, Bikaver or Chateauneuf du Pape.
- Bring us two glasses of Bikaver.

389
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,114
I'm afraid...
- Then a small bottle, please! -Yes.

390
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,316
Let's get tipsy, shall we?

391
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,557
May I?

392
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,916
Is to make me a punctual... wife?

393
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,079
Yes, to make you punctual.
- And will we go on dates?

394
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,750
Of course we will.

395
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,396
What's the matter? - Nothing.
I thought I saw a familiar face.

396
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,600
Do you like it?

397
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,400
Have some wine.

398
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,557
Did you take it?

399
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,360
No, not yet.

400
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,871
What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

401
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,914
Look, Olga.
I'm a man that makes mistakes.

402
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,277
You may think I'm different but...

403
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,030
Are these chairs free?
- No, occupied. - Pardon me.

404
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,830
I wanted you to know that I have
a strong sense of responsibility.

405
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,232
I got used to looking twice before
I do anything. - Thrice.

406
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,553
It's not funny, Olga.

407
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,594
I feel it's pointless to bring new life
into a world full of bombs.

408
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,400
You agree with me, don't you?

409
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,159
But I want to have your child.
- Be sensible, Olga.

410
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,678
You're still a child yourself.

411
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,080
Perhaps... perhaps one day
when the situation is different.

412
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,912
Are we in such situation now?
Tell me.

413
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,558
You have only your scholarship
and my salary is a pittance.

414
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,990
Instead of love we'd feed on dumplings
and barely scrape enough money for rent.

415
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,197
Say no more, please.

416
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,630
At least not now.
You know I will obey you.

417
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,195
I feel like crying now.

418
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,273
I look terrible.
Excuse me.

419
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,750
Are you leaving already?
I've never seen you here before.

420
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,480
I've never been here before.

421
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,719
Do you come here often?
- No. I don't go anywhere much often.

422
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,275
It doesn't matter.
- I know.

423
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,830
One feels a little sorry, though.

424
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,999
Mind your own business
and I will mind mine.

425
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,350
While people live next to each other,
they are far apart as the stars.

426
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,720
We will find someone sooner or later.

427
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,473
Agomensin?
- Give it to me.

428
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,278
Did he give it to you?
- No, I got it myself.

429
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,640
It's nobody's business.
- I thought you were smarter.

430
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,513
As you wish,
we can compliment each other.

431
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,236
You wouldn't do this and
I wouldn't do something else.

432
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,277
Let's dance, shall we?

433
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,752
Are you angry at me?- Why?
That we went home early.

434
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,150
It was too crowded, you see?

435
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,957
A small railway station, eh?

436
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,635
It's still ticking. Do you hear?

437
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,433
You really can't hear it, can you?

438
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,199
It's my first watch.

439
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,720
Wait a moment.

440
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,952
Would you like some coffee?
- No, Olga.

441
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,840
Sleep tight.
I'll sleep in my room tonight.

442
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,680
At the Kovanda's flat.
- But...

443
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,158
To feel free a little
since we are engaged now.

444
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,599
I also thought it would be better
to give you some space.

445
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:35,356
One sometimes needs to look inside,
think and be alone, don't you think?

446
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,551
Yes. Tonight's the right moment.

447
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,317
Good night, Olga.

448
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,469
I enjoyed myself.
Really. Bye.

449
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,239
Miserable life.

450
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,920
ONE AUTUMN DAY...

451
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,313
I wish we finish that damned track soon.
Here, catch.

452
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,350
Those boys are going to kill me one day.

453
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,839
Good morning, Mr. Brzobohaty.
- Good morning.

454
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,917
A pint of milk and two rolls?
- Yes.

455
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,392
It's a fine day, isn't it?
- Let's hope it is.

456
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,038
Miss Olga has already stopped by.
- I didn't ask.

457
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,677
What though!

458
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,514
Good morning, Olga.
Did you sleep well?

459
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,476
Well, unfortunately.
- Why?

460
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,758
Do you know a Mr. Martinec by chance?

461
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,153
Mr. Martinec? I believe I do know him
more than well.

462
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,678
Would you be so kind and tell him
that it's his birthday today?

463
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,394
Is it? Time really flies.

464
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,953
I have some presents for him.

465
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,118
I see.
- Three.

466
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,359
And I'd like to give them to him
tonight. Do you think he'll come?

467
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,157
Crickey, I can't come tonight,
I've got a meeting.

468
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,756
You're so nice.
- How about over lunch?

469
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,431
I wouldn't have enough time.
But how about now?

470
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,719
It won't be a party but at least
you won't have to clean up afterwards.

471
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,356
How about that? - Why not.
- Great.

472
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,079
What have you been doing lately?
Yesterday and the day before?

473
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,513
What have you been doing lately?
- I'm terribly busy.

474
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,789
We were taking over a closed down
pharmacy. Every day's the same.

475
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,914
My first present is coffee or breakfast.
- And what's this?

476
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,556
That's my second present.

477
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,392
Sit down carefully. It's brand new.

478
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,276
Fifty translated pages
for 18 crowns per page.

479
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,200
And the armchair comes
with slippers - my third present.

480
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,914
And next year,
you'll buy me a bath robe, huh?

481
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,119
Not for me, dear!
You won't get me that easily.

482
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,997
You'll have to wait
for your third present.

483
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,436
I don't mind. As long as it's worth it.

484
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,076
Is it a big secret?

485
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,435
I've been wanting
to tell you for a long time...

486
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,351
... that the baby that I was expecting
will be born.

487
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,435
There's no other way.

488
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,276
Why aren't you saying anything, Karel?

489
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,036
I'm taking it down, you see?

490
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,717
It seems much too well prepared
to be true.

491
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,996
What are you saying?!

492
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,433
To be quite frank,
I think you've tricked me.

493
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,554
I feel it's all happening despite of me.
Something I never expected from you.

494
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,714
My birthday.
A small secret, eh?!

495
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,877
I'm no dumb youngster, Olga.
I'm no dumb youngster!

496
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,631
You shouldn't have done this to me!
- What was I supposed to do?

497
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,878
What we agreed on!
Without dirty tricks!

498
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,400
Say one thing and do the other.

499
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,991
For heaven's sake! It's your baby.

500
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:22,071
It has nothing to do with it!
This is about honesty and fair play!

501
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,157
Now we have to get married.
- It's not true. We don't!

502
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,031
Think whatever you want about me,
but my father taught me one thing!

503
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,876
To pay debts of honour!
It's my bill and I will settle it.

504
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,040
What are you doing all day?
Here's the butter.

505
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,870
We're cleaning and cooking.
- You're quite busy, aren't you?

506
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,513
I'll put the eggs in the bag.
Do you cook for Mr. Martinec, too?

507
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,395
No, but we make his bed.

508
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,558
His bed? Well, well.

509
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,954
And where are you today?

510
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,709
To the merry-go-round.

511
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,119
You're so lucky.
- I also have a cat.

512
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,880
A cat?
- I do.

513
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,191
Here's your money back.
Your mummy!

514
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,239
I have to go now.

515
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,230
Come again. - I will.
- I'll be happy to see you again.

516
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,110
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

517
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,357
Good day.
- Good day.

518
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,913
Let me see.
I see you've bought all we needed.

519
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,319
Now we'll tidy up.
- And then?

520
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,955
Then we'll cook dumplings.
- And then?

521
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,675
Good morning, Mrs. Kovandova.
- Good morning.

522
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,998
Then we'll bring lunch to uncle.
- And then?

523
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,200
What will we do then?
- Then we'll go to the merry-go-round.

524
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,750
Yes, we will. Let's go.

525
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,717
It's nice, isn't it?
Why don't you wash your eyes, eh?

526
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,556
Your youngest?
- Our only child.

527
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,639
Catch me if you can!
- Wait, Hanicka!

528
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,154
Don't run!
Wait for me. You'll run yourself out.

529
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,840
You know I can't catch you.

530
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,636
Hanicka.

531
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,036
Do you see what you've done!
Didn't I tell you?!

532
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,594
Good Lord, it's Pesta!
- Good day.

533
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,075
I came for my daughter.

534
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,394
Would you like some cherry brandy?
- There's no need.

535
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,075
Do sit down, Mr. Pesta.

536
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,276
It's all so sudden.

537
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,240
It's a pity my husband isn't here.

538
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,595
Why aren't you drinking, Mr. Pesta?
- Will you drink with me?

539
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,349
No, I don't drink.

540
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,157
You can be together all day
and bring her back in the morning.

541
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,351
It's no use. We're not coming back.

542
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,234
Mr. Pesta, we've got quite
used to having her.

543
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,315
She is all we have in this world.

544
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,359
All you have?
And what do I have?

545
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,480
Frantisek?

546
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,559
It's you, Mr. Martinec?

547
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,310
Mr. Pesta's here
and wants to take our Hana away.

548
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,319
Citizenship... What?
- What should I do now?

549
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,472
Will you come with me?

550
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:36,794
You won't? Don't be scared,
I'll buy you something very nice.

551
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,397
A doll with winking eyes.
How about that?

552
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,716
I never interfere in such affairs.
I have no right or time to do that.

553
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,072
I have enough troubles of my own.

554
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,271
There you have it.
So will you give me her things or not?

555
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,070
Of course. Just a moment.

556
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,390
Do you want to marry me or not?

557
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,474
I always thought I did, Karel.
But I'm not sure now.

558
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,280
Fill in the forms and the wedding agency
will take care of the rest.

559
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,111
We don't want many guests, do we?
- I don't know.

560
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,719
Besides, it doesn't matter.

561
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:37,236
Tell me. Do you love me at all?

562
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:45,355
You have the right to ask a hundred
times. It's a privilege women enjoy.

563
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,437
I've never asked you. Not once.

564
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,349
The thing is that people abuse the word
much too often nowadays.

565
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,840
And maybe I do love you in a certain
way. Would I be here, if I didn't?

566
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,436
Fill in the forms. Here's the address.

567
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,160
Dr. Arnost Brazda, M.D.

568
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,190
What am I supposed to do with it?
- I called him this morning.

569
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:18,033
He's the best doctor you'd find.
And he's a good friend of mine.

570
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,678
He said it still might not be late.
But he has to see you. Today.

571
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,437
He's expecting you
at half past eight tonight.

572
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,718
You've made an appointment for me?
And what if something happens to me?

573
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,950
Look, Olga, we have to act responsibly
since we got ourselves in such a mess.

574
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,359
There's always a risk.

575
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,118
As a father I also have the right to
decide whether I want the baby or not.

576
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,033
One of us has to be sensible.

577
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,074
What makes you think it's you?

578
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,960
What am I to do now?
- What's the matter?

579
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,515
What will I tell my husband?
- What happened?

580
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,839
Look outside. Our Hana is down there.

581
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,840
Pesta simply came for his daughter
and that's all.

582
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,269
Mr. Pesta!
Mr. Pesta!

583
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,474
Don't cry, Mrs. Kovandova.

584
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,675
Calm her down, Olga. I'm already late.
I'll be waiting for you tonight.

585
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,560
Why didn't you tell him anything,
Mr. Martinec?

586
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,711
Wait, Karel.

587
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,719
Wait! You were there?
- I was.

588
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,076
And what did you do?
- What could I do? It was obvious.

589
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,080
He's the father. Don't forget
about tonight. The Variety Arcade.

590
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,080
What an extraordinarily warm
attitude towards fathers you have!

591
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,831
You see, little one, I'm back.
I have something yummy for you.

592
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,635
There. Have a drink.

593
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,117
I'll cut it for you.
Take it in your hand.

594
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,438
It's very good.
Eat it.

595
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,792
Why aren't you eating?

596
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,592
Don't you like it?

597
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:39,278
And would you like a cream roll?
- No, I want a winking doll.

598
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,316
Wait here. I'll be right back.

599
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,430
Your dad will give you a hiding
if you're naughty.

600
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:10,399
Here's a cream roll for you?
It's sweet. Try it.

601
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,277
You always liked cream rolls.

602
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,030
I remember you say:
"Daddy, buy me a cream roll!"

603
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,638
I don't want it.
- Don't you like me?

604
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,514
No.
- No?

605
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,713
And why? Will you tell me?
- I won't.

606
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,433
Right you are!
- Mind your own business!

607
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,589
You...

608
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:58,191
Come. Let's pray for your mummy.
And your daddy.

609
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,793
Hail Mary...
Repeat after me.

610
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,477
Hail Mary.
- Hail Mary.

611
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,479
Full of grace.
- Full of grace.

612
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,513
Our Lord is with thee.
- Our Lord is with thee.

613
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:23,638
Blessed art thou among women.
- Blessed art thou among women.

614
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:31,594
Blessed art thou among women.
- Blessed art thou among women.

615
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,555
Blessed art...

616
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,396
Hanicka!

617
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:58,040
Hana, where are you?

618
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,676
Hanicka?

619
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,111
Hanicka!

620
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,232
Hanicka! Hanicka!

621
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,957
Hanicka!
- Shh!

622
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,953
Hanicka!
Hanicka!

623
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,795
Hanicka.

624
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,710
Hanicka!

625
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,557
Wait, come here.
Have you seen a little girl?

626
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,356
Alittle girl.
About this big. You haven't.

627
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,718
Please. Have you seen...

628
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,875
Good evening.
- Good evening. What is it?

629
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,560
Am I disturbing you? - Not at all.
- I need to talk to you.

630
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,516
I feel terrible, you see?
And I have nobody else to talk to.

631
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:05,399
I'm sorry but I can't right now.

632
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:09,315
Tomorrow perhaps.
Now's not the right time.

633
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,555
Excuse me.

634
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:19,920
Tomorrow then?
- Yes. Tomorrow perhaps.

635
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,115
Who was that?
- My neighbour.

636
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,951
They always come when you least
need them. Was it salt she wanted?

637
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,356
I don't know what she wanted.

638
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,956
Won't you take your coat off?
- If I may.

639
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,589
That's my husband.

640
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,393
So this is him?

641
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:29,917
What was he like?
- Why was? He still is.

642
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,880
Forgive me.

643
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,552
Did you love him very much, Maruna?

644
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,437
Why are you using the past tense?
I love him.

645
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:51,550
You love him and not me.
- I love you, too.

646
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,990
Don't be angry at me
but I don't seem to understand.

647
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,159
I don't like to talk about things
that people don't talk about.

648
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,837
Although years are passing.
You're alone and you're not happy.

649
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,716
You have someone
and that someone is me.

650
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,999
However, there's someone else
who is not here.

651
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,159
It's a pity to waste a single hour,
a single day, a single night.

652
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,840
What do you know?

653
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,160
I never share anything with anybody.
I want either everything or nothing!

654
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,636
Why am I here?
To help you live your dream?

655
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,192
Or did you want to show me his picture?
- Maybe.

656
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,153
It seems it's not enough for you, is it?

657
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:07,198
We've never talked like that.
- Leave me alone, please.

658
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,311
You don't mean it, do you?

659
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,635
Should I go?

660
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,272
Go. Quick.
Until there's time.

661
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,360
All right.

662
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:24,800
Let go of me!
We only went to pray!

663
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,515
Why did you take her away
if you can't look after her?!

664
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,792
Do you realize what could happen
to her?! You bastard!!!

665
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,037
Don't yell at me.
I have a terrible headache.

666
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,910
You have a headache?!
- Let go of him, Frantisek!

667
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,714
Go home!
Get inside, rascals!

668
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,753
Did you go to the police?
- Don't worry, she'll turn up somewhere.

669
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:54,752
Besides, you can keep her.

670
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,759
Who would be her chaperon one day?
I'm...

671
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,432
Calm down. Waiting isn't that bad.

672
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,075
It sometimes takes hours
before they find a missing child.

673
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,079
Ferdi over there
has been waiting here all evening.

674
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,636
Are you bored, Ferdi?
- I am.

675
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,915
So am I.

676
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,672
The chief wants one of them...
- Tell them yourself.

677
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,193
We've found some things
so if you could have a look at them.

678
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,996
Wait. I'll go.

679
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,876
You say there wasn't anyone nearby
in the church. Did you look well?

680
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:00,275
Nobody was there. Except for Our Lord,
though it seems he wasn't there either.

681
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,636
Good evening.
- Good evening and sit down, miss.

682
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,516
Look at the things found today
and see if you don't recognize anything.

683
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:13,157
Let us admit that she may have
run away. Why?

684
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,439
Did you treat her badly?

685
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,155
Was she afraid of you?

686
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,676
So you don't want to give me
any answers, do you?

687
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,350
It seems we will have to recommend
that your child be taken away from you.

688
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,554
You certainly qualify.

689
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:41,834
Not to worry, my record is clean.
I only booze a bit more than I should.

690
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,712
Speak to the point, please.
- To the point.

691
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,509
What is the point for you?

692
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,191
Everything's plain and simple
for you all!

693
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,310
In apple-pie order. Here's good,
there's evil, with a line in the middle.

694
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,518
But I walk the line every day!
Understand?

695
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,196
You don't, do you?
You won't find it in any handbook.

696
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,912
Stop blethering.

697
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,319
Can't you see that something
may have happened to the child?

698
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,718
Someone may have taken her away.
She may have been killed.

699
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,830
You're a father, aren't you?

700
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,198
I know I'm a father.
But what do you expect me to do?!

701
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,793
Who do you call a father?
- It doesn't concern you, miss.

702
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,440
Did you recognize anything?
- No.

703
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,678
In that case, thank you.
- Goodbye. -Goodbye.

704
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:42,680
I do love her.
I even wanted to buy her a doll.

705
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,475
What's your name, little one?
- I don't know.

706
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,396
And where's your mother?
- Home.

707
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,550
And where is that?
- At the tram terminal.

708
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,717
At what tram terminal?
- Our tram terminal. - I see.

709
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,838
We've ruined your plans
for tonight, Miss Olga, haven't we?

710
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,675
No, don't worry.
I had no plans for tonight.

711
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,236
Where is he? Is he all right?

712
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,750
You are Mrs...
- Here you are!

713
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,669
You little rascal!
How could you leave the house?!

714
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,758
Mummy, don't smack me!
- Not a word!

715
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,757
You've scared your mummy to death.
I thought he got run over by a car.

716
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,432
I was bored, Mummy.
- Bored! I'll teach you a lesson!

717
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,911
You won't be bored
after you see your daddy.

718
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:20,116
Come, Ferdi. Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Ferdi. -See you.

719
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,438
I hope I won't.
Will you sign this, please?- Yes.

720
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,399
One can't help all that paperwork.
After you.

721
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:32,116
That's how it goes.
Some have a child without wanting it,

722
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,397
while others wish for it and have none.
- You can't take it like that.

723
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,319
Say it. Say what's troubling you
in front of Miss Olga here.

724
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,632
Let it out. - But, dear.
- And don't pity me.

725
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,515
Say that I didn't give you your own
child and that I let him steal this one!

726
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,400
I was never angry at you for that.
- Don't be so kind!

727
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,833
Do you think I don't hear you at night?
Do you think I can sleep?

728
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,200
Olga!

729
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:21,234
The phone!
The phone's ringing!

730
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,998
Are you stupid, you silly goose!

731
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,676
Olga!

732
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,356
What took you so long? I've been
waiting for you for half an hour.

733
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,558
Do you know what we said about
punctuality when I gave you the watch.

734
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,235
I understand. Come on.

735
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,073
What's the matter?
- I'm not going anywhere.

736
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,720
We can't let him wait, Olga!

737
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,874
Don't be scared.
Many women walked up these stairs.

738
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:54,916
Let's go.
Olga! Where are you going?

739
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,316
Don't make a scene, Olga!
We can't leave it like this.

740
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,957
Really? I will have the baby
despite that it's yours.

741
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,754
We can sort it out,
I'm not forcing you to do anything.

742
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,590
You know I love you.
Did you fill in the forms?

743
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,077
You'll take all your things tomorrow.
I want to be alone.

744
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:20,598
I didn't deserve this
after what happened between us.

745
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:29,919
I don't care about you any more.
It's as though you had never existed.

746
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,993
Olga! Olga!

747
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,150
Get up, young man,
or I'll have to sweep under you.

748
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,119
AND ONE WINTER DAY...

749
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:37,839
Alittle bit to the right! And up!
Good day, Mr. Brzobohaty.

750
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,116
Happy New Year.
- A Happy New Year to you too.

751
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,670
Good day.
- Good day.

752
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:49,833
Good day, Mr. Brzobohaty.
I've got something for you today.

753
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,953
For me?
- Where is it? Ah, here it is.

754
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,878
It must be an invitation to a meeting.
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

755
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,719
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

756
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,756
Hanicka, where are you?

757
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,636
What did you get for Christmas?
- I'm letting snakes out.

758
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:11,111
Happy New Year, Mr. Brzobohaty.
Who are the flowers for?

759
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,356
Good day.

760
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,591
Happy New Year.
If you allow me...

761
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:45,234
...a quartrefoil for good luck.

762
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,555
How nice of you.

763
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,595
Won't you come in?
- I have to go to work.

764
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,909
Well...

765
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,872
I'll water it.

766
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,070
Another year has passed...

767
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:12,712
...and look at all that happened
in our rather ordinary house.

768
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,956
I beg your pardon?

769
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,191
I said all that happened
in our house this year.

770
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,317
All sorts of things happen.
- Be careful.

771
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:29,156
Nothing happens to bastards, though.
Only good people have to pay.

772
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,516
Always the good people.

773
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,875
Well, I should be going now.

774
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,400
Goodbye.
- Happy New Year.

775
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,640
Miss Olga, would you marry me?

776
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,031
Me?

777
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:52,630
Marry you?
- Yes.

778
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:57,198
I've been thinking about it a lot.
Quite a lot but...

779
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:02,556
You would marry me just to help out
a friend or a neighbour or...

780
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:06,873
No, I just want the baby
to have a name. So...

781
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:11,956
But it will have a name.
My name. - Of course.

782
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:17,189
Don't you think that two people have
to love each other to live together?

783
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,911
That's what they say.

784
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:25,151
Yet one has to be humble.
Sometimes.

785
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:29,680
I'm not humble at all. - It's all right.
- Don't be angry at me.

786
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,277
Not at all. -Take it for good luck.
- No, I can't.

787
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,190
Forgive me, I thought you were alone.
- It's all right. I'm leaving.

788
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,070
I only wanted to ask you
whether you would like

789
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,715
to celebrate New Year's Eve with me.

790
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:48,273
Would you?- I'd love to.
I'm not much of a drinker, though.

791
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,397
Settled then? - Yes.
Goodbye. -Goodbye.

792
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,440
Last station.
Everyone please get off!

793
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,799
Hey, this is the end.
Get off.

794
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,349
You forgot something!

795
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,956
Should I throw this away?
- Give it to me.

796
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,715
It's for my little girl.
I came to visit her, you see?

797
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:41,514
Oh boy! What is this place?
- This is the end, old chum.

798
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,871
And is this place called the Loop?
- Oh no. We've passed it.

799
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,630
The terminal is further now
and in a year, we'll be even further.

800
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,271
You talk like a pamphlet.

801
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,799
Nothing's changed!
There's a pub here like everywhere else!

802
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:04,395
I wouldn't put on airs, you optimist.
All trams will soon be gone.

803
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:59,192
Do you know what I fear the most?
Loneliness.

804
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,230
And I've got plenty of it.

805
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,959
Wouldn't you like to cry just a little?

806
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:19,397
I'm not sure whether the circumstances
are right. We may try, though.

807
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,480
I'm really not good at crying today.

808
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:56,874
Do you think I could drink a little?
Won't it harm the baby?

809
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:01,871
I'm sure it will be a boy.
So let's drink to him being a true man.

810
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,155
Because life is much easier for men.

811
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,789
Let's hope it is a true human being.
- That would suffer a little bit.

812
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:18,512
That wouldn't be lazy, stupid
or conceited.

813
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,438
That would know how to love someone.

814
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:26,758
That would really love someone
and wouldn't be alone.

815
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,635
And he mustn't be a pharmacist.

816
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:35,153
What of it! You can be a pharmacist
if you want.

817
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,879
Don't kick me. I'm your mummy.

818
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:59,478
Hurry up, fellas!
We're playing at two more pubs!

819
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,230
Hurry up!
Goodbye!

820
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,950
Come here, don't be scared.

821
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,951
Is your name Hanicka?
- No, my name is Madla.

822
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,437
Madla?
Do you like the doll?

823
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:26,433
I do.
- You do? Here, take it.

824
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,589
Take it before I change my mind.

825
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,598
