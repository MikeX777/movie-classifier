They're assholes.

63

00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,617
Okay.

Okay what?

00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:20,752
Okay, they are.

72
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,679
So where do you go to school?

73
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,451
Do you live around here?

74
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,821
Did you get that
from Hot Topic?

75
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,622
My dad won't let me go there.

76
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,691
He says it's too intense.

77
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,662
Fine.

78
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,963

Cool.

86
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,974
You want to hang out, right?

87
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,676
So let's hang out.

88
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,559
Jesus.

89
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,561
It's like Whole Foods
threw up in here.

90
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,701
Cool. I gotta go.

91
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,670
My stepmom has some money.

92
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,518
You want to see my room?

93
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,601
Wow.

94
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,470
You really like to
cut shit out

95
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:52,704
and tape it together, huh?

96
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,148
Let's go.

97
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,753
Hey, you got a flashlight?

98
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,225
- My stepbrother has one.
- Go get it.

99
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,027
Go on.

100
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,996
- I don't want...
- Fucking get it!

101
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,223
Hey, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

102
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,938
Elly?

103
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,079
"Brendan's Dojo."

104
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,081
Who's Brendan?

105
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,182
Stepbrother.

106
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,288
It's like the fucking
Death Star in here.

107
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,624
Hentai porn.

108
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,227
Brendan's a freak.

109
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,330
Wait.

110
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,233
Oy. Two dollars.

111
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,669
You're not supposed to
touch his stuff.

112
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,241
Don't!

113
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,177
Don't?

114
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,916
"Karate master eighteen."

115
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,354
Jesus Christ,
so much karate bullshit.

116
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,333
Are these pictures of you?

117
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,606
He made me.

118
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,175
Get in here.

119
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,245
Get the fuck in here!

120
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,680
Come on.

121
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,184
Do it.

122
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,389
Hit it! Fuck him!
Say, "Fuck him!"

123
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,058
Harder, come on.

124
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,395
Fuck him!
Come on, harder!

125
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,255
You think I'm gonna waste
my hard-earned money on rent?

126
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,157
Fuck that.

127
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,058
My house is free so long
as you follow the rules.

128
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,126
Rules?

129
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,795
Can't live without rules.

130
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,730
Who makes the rules?

131
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,198
I do.

132
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Camp only with
people you know.

133
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,436
All kinds of shit can happen
when you're sleeping.

134
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,704
Like what?

135
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,105
We live in
a transactional reality.

136
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,874
Everyone is either buying,
selling or stealing.

137
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,743
Information
is fucking currency.

138
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,977
So you don't give
anyone anything

139
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,479
that they can use to hurt you.

140
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,181
Also, stay the fuck away
from anyone

141
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,016
who says they love you
after like a day.

142
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,784
Nobody loves anyone.

143
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,153
Next, don't fuck with people
and they won't fuck with you.

144
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,122
And if you do fuck with people,

145
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,757
you're gonna run into them
again, so...

146
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,325
Actually, the rule should be
don't fuck with people.

147
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,608
Unless you're sure that you
can beat the shit out of them.

148
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,062
Is that it?

149
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:12,997
No.

150
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,401
Stay out of my shit.

151
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:20,772
Come on.

152
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:46,998
Yo, Daphne.

153
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,786
Yeah, I wasn't
expecting company.

154
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,813
You don't even know
who you talking to.

155
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,602
Magic trick.

156
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,606
Dude, that's a five.

157
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,312
Hey, you can't be here.

158
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,131
Dude, you can fuck off,
it's fine.

159
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,949
Dude, I'm serious.
No panhandling in front of my restaurant.

160
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,617
- I'm...
- Get going.

161
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,687
Come on, get going.

162
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,190
- We're leaving.
- Thank you.

163
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,193
Grab the cup.

164
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,303
- Thank you.
- Sharing is caring, thank you.

165
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,073
Fucker.

166
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,033
You're in my spot.

167
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,031
- Sorry love, early bird...
- Gets their drug-dealing ass out of my fucking spot.

168
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,144
Hold up, I know you.

169
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:59,234
It's that chick I told you about
that pulled a knife on me.

170
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,324
You invaded my alley while I was
sleeping you crusty, fucking wannabe.

171
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,494
I was looking for my shit you
stole outside the Coffee Bean.

172
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,230
- Duct-taped in the garbage can.
- It was my inventory.

173
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,366
Which you took while
I was getting busted.

174
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,635
- That's a bitch-ass...
- If it wasn't me it would have been someone else.

175
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,971
The way I see it, sounds like
he paid his rent.

176
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,605
You can have your spot
back tomorrow.

177
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,507
Hey, fuck you, man.

178
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,149
- Deal?
- Fuck it.

179
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,478
Hey, 5-O, 5-O.

180
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,084
I apologize, you mean,
mean ladies.

181
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,452
Fuck you.

182
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,227
Zip up your sweater.

183
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,762
- What? Why?
- Just do it.

184
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,731
Okay.

185
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,322
Got any applications?

186
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:06,724
No.

187
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,666
I'm not getting picked up
for kidnapping.

188
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:16,734
You're 16.

189
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,270
- I'm 13.
- Out here you're 16.

190
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,372
- And we're getting rid of Elly.
- But my mom's middle name was...

191
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,308
Close your eyes.

192
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,243
Smelly Elly does not even pass
the playground test.

193
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,711
What the hell
were your parents thinking?

194
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,779
It's better than Tits.

195
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,248
Yeah, well.

196
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,316
Anything is better than Tits.

197
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,421
No appointments till 3:00,
bitch.

198
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,836
This was the second-worst
day of my life.

199
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,306
I was just ranging in Echo Park
and I'm cleaning up.

200
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,076
Thanks.
I've got a week's worth of cash in my cup.

201
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,779
And like, there's this girl,

202
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,314
who cries for me on a bench.

203
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,149
She had this '80s sweatpants.

204
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,518
And those, like,
green plastic glasses.

205
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,155
I'm like, is she a hipster
or is she mentally retarded?

206
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,592
And this cholo comes up to me,
jacks my bank, breaks my nose.

207
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,328
I spent the rest of my night
bleeding my face off

208
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,464
under a giant mural
of Johnny Depp.

209
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,869
- Wake up.
- Hey.

210
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:29,774
What is that thing, anyway?

211
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,709
Give it back.

212
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,380
What the fuck are you saying?

213
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,183
It's...

214
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,321
I'm homeless, I have time.

215
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,457
It's gonna be for something.

216
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,259
Stop.

217
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,733
What was the worst?

218
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,371
- What?
- You said Echo Park was the second-worst day.

219
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,873
What was the worst?

220
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,323
That's a risk I'm willing to take
'cause I love my customers.

221
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,592
Here you go,
best dollar Pop-Tart

222
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,528
this side of Mar Vista.

223
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,630
Drive your shit bucket
back to the valley, Rob.

224
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,265
Fuck you talking about, Tracy?

225
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,466
She's a classic.

226
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,734
You owe me a dollar for that.

227
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:30,902
You want one?

228
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:34,372
I got blueberry frosted,
confetti cupcake.

229
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,908
- Limited edition cinnamon roll.
- Fuck off.

230
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,776
I told you we don't split up.

231
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:39,877
You didn't tell me that.

232
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,829
You don't need to be so harsh.

233
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,780
- Just helping the kid out.
- I promise he wasn't doing anything.

234
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,450
Shut up, sit down over there
and take the chips.

235
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,753
She looked hungry,
gave her a Pop-Tart.

236
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:49,820
What a fucking monster.

237
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,656
Jesus.

238
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,724
Hey.

239
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,560
I even got a flavor
you might like.

240
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,865
- How much?
- 40 each.

241
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,906
Twenty or I tell them you tried
to solicit my sister.

242
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,777
Twenty-five
and we're friends again.

243
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,579
- Deal?
- I'm not your friend.

244
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,883
Stay away from him.

245
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,552
- That's a rule.
- Okay, jeez.

246
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,673
There's these things
called tiny houses.

247
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,276
They're really cheap.

248
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,647
And we have the money
from my stepmom already.

249
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,016
We can save it up, right?

250
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,518
We could have a place
and like, be a family.

251
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,354
Except better.

252
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,392
See, there's our garden.

253
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,829
There's like a forest around it
so nobody would bother us.

254
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,866
It's Vancouver.

255
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,535
Where my mom is from.

256
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,004
It's only 50 dollars
to get there on the bus.

257
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,806
Angie, I got you.

258
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,440
Can't we just get food
like normal people?

259
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:25,443
Normal people pay 20 bucks for a bag
of popcorn and some gummy bears.

260
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,112
Eat.

261
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,985
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Come on.

262
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,787
It's like a treasure hunt.

263
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,090
It's not funny, it's disgusting.

264
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,358
Fine.

265
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,627
If my life's so gross then...

266
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,781
Just go back home, then.

267
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,862
- Wait...
- No, go back home to your fucking brother.

268
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:51,902
Stepbrother.

269
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,575
Shit.

270
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,445
Go get a corn dog or something.

271
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,547
No, that's for our bus tickets.

272
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,550
It's for us.

273
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:12,923
Yo, Crystal.

274
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,558
Got a present for you.

275
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,160
- How you doing?
- Sup, Jenga?

276
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:17,928
I don't know them.

277
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,564
They're cool.

278
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,466
I'll be back.

279
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,804
I like your stuff.

280
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,006
It's art.

281
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,082
Look, I just want you to know
I love my wife.

282
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,686
Okay.

283
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:56,754
Um, do we...

284
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,632
- You taking good care of my baby brother?
- What the hell?

285
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,674
Aren't you gonna introduce
yourself to the nice man?

286
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,203
Go on.

287
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,271
He doesn't bite.

288
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,608
I'm Rusty.

289
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,813
- Uh... Kevin.
- Isn't he just the cutest thing, Kevin?

290
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,855
So... What do we...

291
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,024
It's 30 bucks, you just
show him what to do.

292
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,094
Fuck. Right...

293
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,302
I'll wait for you
across the street.

294
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,948
- Should I...
- Bless you.

295
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,384
Do you want me to watch?

296
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,319
No.

297
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,254
Wow, okay. I...

298
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,060
So, this one time Rusty did
this thing and it was really hot.

299
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,696
- Do you wanna hear?
- Uh...

300
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,365
I'll take that as a yes, okay.

301
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:18,002
So, it's winter and
we're living in Minnesota.

302
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,270
And Rusty decides he wants to

303
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,007
do an outdoor
performance.

304
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,993
And he climbs up on top
of the garage.

305
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:28,978
And our neighbor, this dirty little
old man is totally peeping on Rusty

306
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,416
like, totally violating his
personal playtime space, you know.

307
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,084
Yeah.

308
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:38,222
Anyhow, so Rusty strips down
to his underwear

309
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,791
and then jumps off the garage
and disappears.

310
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,359
Like, he fell off
the face of the Earth.

311
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,927
I mean, this is bear country.

312
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,331
Little naked Rusty could've
eaten by a big bear.

313
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,067
Like Cujo, or whatever they are.

314
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,902
Getting close, Kev?

315
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,771
- Ah.
- No rush.

316
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:57,374
So, our neighbor sees Rusty
just waist-deep in a snowbank.

317
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,444
He puts his little hands above
his head and he goes, "Ta-da!"

318
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,980
Well, the sight of Rusty
there just made him laugh.

319
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,633
He actually couldn't stop.

320
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,834
I mean, he really, he really couldn't stop.
So he had a stroke and he died but...

321
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,422
He died laughing, Kevin.

322
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,224
Laughing
in the snow.

323
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,095
Ah!

324
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,431
Thank you.

325
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,650
You're hilarious.

326
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:24,868
Well, you obviously had no idea
what the fuck you were doing.

327
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,004
- I'm Tracy.
- Rusty.

328
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,008
There's a sprinkler
by the boardwalk.

329
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,342
Yeah.

330
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,064
It's not like
we're like, dating.

331
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,799
You know,
it's more than that.

332
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,234
Yeah, it always is.

333
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,069
I mean he's got to
stay behind in Oxnard

334
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,472
until school gets out,
but I don't even feel like we're apart.

335
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:05,175
- I think I like Ashley.
- We knew, like the first time.

336
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,810
- He was in the choir room.
- Kinky.

337
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,279
- Yeah, I know. I don't even like the choir.
- Sofia.

338
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,749
But then my fucking mom, she picked
up the phone while we were talking.

339
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,350
- and she started asking all these questions.
- Ariel.

340
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,252
- Do you like Ariel, Tracy?
- We both got really scared.

341
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,222
Both of use kind of freaked the fuck out.
So, he gave me some money,

342
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:21,325
he told me to come out here and
that he'd come and meet me.

343
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,995
- How long have you been waiting?
- Only like, a month.

344
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,431
So Rusty, has Tracy given
you a street name yet?

345
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,500
- I'm getting one.
- A street name?

346
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:31,835
Yeah, maybe we'll
let you help us.

347
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,504
Okay. Uh...

348
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,372
Name of your first pet and
the street you grew up on?

349
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,474
- That's porn star name.
- Pickles Washington?

350
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,309
That's... that's awful.

351
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,845
- I like it.
- Um, what's your favorite cartoon?

352
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,114
Winnie the Pooh.

353
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,517
Please, not Pooh.

354
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,485
I think...

355
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,054
Eeyore.

356
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,527
Nice. Eeyore.

357
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,930
I like it. Eeyore.

358
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,266
Let's grab our shit.
Let's go home.

359
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,436
Can we bring him?

360
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,279
Do you wanna come?

361
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,547
Yeah.

368
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,296
I've got a thing.
Bring me lunch in an hour.

369
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,166
Asshole manager starts his shift at 2:00.
So, don't be late.

370
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,601
You're babysitting.

371
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:12,936
Nobody eats if you fuck it up.
So, don't fuck it up.

372
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,474
- You wanna go?
- I guess so.

373
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,449
Hey, kid. You must
pay before you microwave.

374
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,451
- What?
- Pay first.

375
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,026
It's $4.17.

376
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,020
It's $4.17.

377
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,522
I'm counting. Jesus.

378
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,058
Dammit, I see that.

379
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,526
- What, I'm...
- You little thiefs.

380
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,461
- I see you. Get out of my store.
- I'll put them back.

381
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,630
- I'll put them back.
- They take it out of my paycheck. Get out.

382
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,999
- I'm sorry.
- You and your friend don't come back.

383
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,036
Shit.

384
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,237
Why'd you do that?

385
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,106
Sorry.

386
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,709
What are we supposed
to do now?

387
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,981
Hey, don't worry about it.

388
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,382
That guy is a dick
to everyone.

389
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,251
Thanks.

390
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,420
This is Germ. Hey, no begging.

391
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,190
You're friends
with the mean lady, right?

392
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,559
I'm Squid.

393
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,694
I'm Eeyore,
that's my street name.

394
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:20,097
- Yeah.
- I'm Rusty.

395
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,165
He's Rusty.

396
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,001
- My real name.
- Where you from?

397
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,336
- Oxnard.
- I hear Oxnard sucks.

398
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,339
Yeah.

399
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,609
Here's your change.

400
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,045
Thank you.

401
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,654
Get the hell out of here.

402
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,190
This isn't a hotel. Get out.

403
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,592
This is a place of business.

404
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,694
I'm calling the cops.

405
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,056
- A little faster, please.
- Yeah, I'm fucking... I'm going.

406
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,370
Eeyore! You guys fucked up.

407
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,538
You were supposed to come
get me.

408
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,240
Rusty got in trouble with
the counter guy.

409
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:04,674
You stole like a half a pound
of gummy.

410
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,276
You guys just lost us our camp.

411
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,377
I'm sorry.

412
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,147
I don't care.

413
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,185
- You guys can sleep in our spot.
- Okay.

414
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,155
Fuck that.

415
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:20,590
- But we know them.
- Not really.

416
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,360
- It's a pretty dope spot.
- It's only for one night.

417
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,190
Well, come on.

418
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:11,308
I am the machete!

419
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,643
I am the protector
of the innocent.

420
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,346
I am the stains of the wicked.

421
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,228
Evening, lady.

422
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,165
Little sister's making coffee.

423
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,234
Chill.

424
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:41,238
Don't spill it.

425
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:52,816
Where you going?

426
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,465
So, there would be flowers
all around here.

427
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,167
And, I know what kinds
of flowers grow here,

428
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,235
so that would be my job.

429
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,538
I mean, if you'll want then
you all could come with us.

430
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,239
What would my job be?

431
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,541
You'd make the art on the walls.

432
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,342
You could paint skulls
and stuff.

433
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,944
That say like, "beware" and
"keep out".

434
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,346
- Ah. Cool.
- What's Tracy's job?

435
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,668
She'll keep the house clean.

436
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,219
Hey, guys.

437
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,661
- How's it going?
- Hey, Rick.

438
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,823
Oh, um... Anyway.

439
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,325
- Hungry?
- Nah, we're good.

440
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,927
We don't need your Jesus
cheese man.

441
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,528
I volunteer at an organization
called Safe Streets.

442
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,397
We don't give a fuck,
just go off, man.

443
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,265
- We're open 24 hours a day.
- Hey, get away.

444
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,235
- Get away...
- Grab a watermelon martini, man.

445
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,504
Yeah, get the hell away from us.

446
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,573
If you need any jobs,
we can help with...

447
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,374
Get the fuck outta here, Rick.

448
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,352
It's just temporary.

449
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,256
Don't fuck with me and
I won't fuck with you.

450
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,440
And the Earth shall drown

451
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,775
as it brings forth this bounty.
It's a long way...

452
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:28,011
All right. I know a place.

453
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,316
Unless you wanna curl up
with the machete.

454
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,785
Aye! Everything hurts.

455
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,788
I am Machete.

456
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,557
Jesus! We know!

457
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,926
You stole my dog!

458
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,595
And my radio...

459
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:50,433
Swing and a miss.

460
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,410
Hey!

461
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,803
Let's go, Germ.
Come on.

462
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,426
Okay, now just how I did it.

463
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,908
Grab it, get a running start
and jump.

464
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,114
There we go.

465
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,799
Oh! Congratulations,
you just learned how to hop a train.

466
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,371
- A train?
- A train.

467
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,639
People still do that.
People still do a lot of things.

468
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,375
We can catch one
and go wherever.

469
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,843
I'm waiting for someone.

470
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,778
Besides, isn't that dangerous?

471
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,381
Waiting for someone
who's never going to show up?

472
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,915
Yeah, it's fuckin' treacherous.

473
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,097
What about this one?

474
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,699
Drew that in Flagstaff.

475
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,801
Dad had a missionary complex.

476
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,636
Drew lots of demons
just to piss him off.

477
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,638
Uh, and this one?

478
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,140
For-profit foster home.

479
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,509
Parents kept the checks
from the state.

480
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,444
I don't even think
they knew my name.

481
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:15,879
What are y'all doing?

482
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,447
None of your business.

483
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,584
Took you long enough.

484
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,888

Think he'll believe you?

505
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,174
It doesn't matter.

506
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,011
I believe you.

507
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,654
They won't do it for us.

508
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:07,216
- Portland, really?
- I really wanna go there, dude.

509
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,885
Yeah, it'd be cool.

510
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,774
She's a little kid.

511
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,296
What are you doing
having her out here?

512
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,145
You taking money from her?

513
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,036
I started when I was like...

514
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,205
Six.

515
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,772
I could have a place
to stay tonight

516
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,708
but I don't get down
like that.

517
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,711
So, I didn't know what to do.

518
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:10,032
I saw you guys talking.

519
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,968
- Did he say anything about me?
- Critter?

520
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,437
Yeah, he said you're 13.

521
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,759
You're just mad because he likes
me more than he likes you.

522
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,012
Do you ever think
you could kill him?

523
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,981
I mean, Brendan.

524
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,016
For what he did.

525
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:36,859
Will you do some fucking work here?
I'm doing it all myself.

526
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,862
I work! I make a lot of
money for us.

527
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,831
Everything ok, ladies?

528
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:45,368
- I'm 16.
- You look about my daughter's age.

529
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,236
I'm guessing seventh grade?

530
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,838
We're homeschooled.

531
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,874
This your sister?

532
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:57,346
Jesus! Angie,
stop being so spacey.

533
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:00,116
- Our mom says we need to broaden our horizons.
- We go to school at home.

534
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,418
We're supposed to write this essay
on how poor people use laundromats

535
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,370
- more than rich people.
- Right?

536
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:06,411
- Mom would've come, but she's sick.
- She has AIDS.

537
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:11,394
- And the flu.
- Uh-huh.

538
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:15,231
This happens all the time.

539
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:17,834
If you want to see it,
our certificate's in my bag right there.

540
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,336
Sure.

541
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,174
Hey, hold on.
You can't do that.

542
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,443
- I have rights.
- This is yours? Calm down!

543
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:30,046
I am calm. You ever
hear of the Constitution?

544
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:33,249
This bag... You need a warrant to
even touch my... Yeah, okay, great.

545
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,062
It's stuck.

546
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,399
Get down.

547
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,206
- Who's Angie?
- Get back.

548
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,975
You called me Angie.
Who is that?

549
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,111
She was my sister.
Be quiet.

550
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:04,413
- Is she at home?
- Shh.

551
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:06,983
- Is she dead?
- Do you want him to take you home?

552
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,185
- Don't you miss her?
- No.

553
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,620
I don't.

554
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,922
Shit.

555
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:28,905
I got to pee.
Think it's okay?

556
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,172
Go back there.

557
00:48:58,336 --> 00:48:59,435
All done.

558
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,537
Cool.

559
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,074
Let's go.

560
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,546
How long is this gonna take?
I'm fucking jonesing.

561
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:11,948
- Can I just...
- I said no.

562
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,983
But I'm the lookout.
He's paying me $6.

563
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:15,601
- Critter.
- It's fine.

564
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:17,218
You don't want her to be the lookout,
you be the lookout.

565
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:19,588
- Wait. So, I'm not the lookout?
- Not anymore.

566
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,258
- I got to be something.
- Fine, you're assistant.

567
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:26,062
- How much does the assistant get?
- $6.

568
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:28,264
Yes. I'm the assistant.

569
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,966
You're lookout.

570
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,240
- Come on, man. That's twice what I paid last...
- I understand that.

571
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:39,508
And I like you.

572
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,310
Don't use, you're
a good customer.

573
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,347
But it's so dry right now It's
like Georgia O'Keeffe at 85.

574
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:46,182
You know what I'm saying?

575
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:50,453
Oh man, this guy doesn't know
who Georgia O'Keeffe is.

576
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:53,222
Hey, you need to go down to
the Getty sometime, <i>papi.</i>

577
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,957
Read a book.

578
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,691
Juan Carlo,
you're really not gonna take this cash?

579
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,061
- I need another $150.
- I don't have another $150.

580
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,663
- Then I can't help you.
- Boss.

581
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,665
Critter. Just get halves,
let's go.

582
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,634
Hey, who the fuck
is this? Tell your lady,

583
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:08,304
- outside. Not cool,<i> papi.</i>
- Yeah, I'm not his lady.

584
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,740
Hey, back the fuck off!

585
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:14,744
Okay, Okay, Okay. I thought
I recognized that voice.

586
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:17,346
She's a friend.
We go way back.

587
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,048
Hi, Rob.

588
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,751
- Hi, Eeyore.
- Hey, put it down.

589
00:50:21,753 --> 00:50:25,054
- But he's so cute.
- They are cute, aren't they, sweetheart?

590
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:26,622
All right, Critter.
Do whatever the fuck you want

591
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,557
with your gangster friends here
but me and Eeyore are leaving.

592
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,693
Come on.

593
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,495
Rob is paying me
to babysit the kittens.

594
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:34,163
Hired her for the hour.

595
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,365
Look, Juan Carlo,
I've been A-one since day one.

596
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,234
Let me buy this shit
on credit, man.

597
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:39,468
You know I'm good
for it.

598
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,176
You know what?
You're right.

599
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:48,744
Your girlfriend's
a crazy bitch.

600
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:51,313
But you're a good customer.
Dan, give him the shit.

601
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,816
- Juan Carlo.
- Yeah.

602
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,118
- Can I play devil's advocate here for a second?
- Anytime.

603
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,820
I don't know this kid.

604
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:00,356
But, this one,
I've known her a while.

605
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:03,426
Look, none of these people have anything to do...
- Excuse me!

606
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,327
Excuse me!

607
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,665
She's gonna take what you
entrusted to her friend here.

608
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:12,334
She's gonna put it
up her arm and float away

609
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:13,502
where you can't find her.

610
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,672
But I'm not
an unreasonable person.

611
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,707
So, I propose
a compromise.

612
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:23,079
We retain our babysitter until this
one makes good on his promise.

613
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:24,780
Just for a few days.

614
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:27,149
He's good for it.

615
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:29,552
Motherfucker! You're such
a piece of shit.

616
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,487
Get the fuck away from her.

617
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,522
- Fuck you!
- There she goes, what did I say?

618
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,641
Get the fuck out of here,
take that crazy bitch with you.

619
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:37,759
I see your fucking face again,
kill you in shower like<i> Psycho.</i>

620
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,563
- Hey, like<i> Scarface.</i>
- Ah, even better.

621
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,364
Look at him,
he has no idea what I'm talking about.

622
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:44,233
Fucking millennials. Go!

623
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,168
Hey, give me your phone.

624
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,369
I got to call my friend.

625
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,579
Hey, not out here.
Meet me in the garage.

626
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:04,680
See you in a second.

627
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:14,657
Hey, I've only got forty, so

628
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,592
- can you spot me the...
- Shut the fuck up.

629
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:18,444
Let's go.

630
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,525
I don't want your fucking money.

631
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:28,204
That's it.

632
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:29,939
Oh, fuck!

633
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,508
Yeah, you like that.

634
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:36,345
Fuck!

635
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,814
Come on, you fucking slut!

636
00:53:58,703 --> 00:53:59,868
Get the fuck out.

637
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,743
Guys.

638
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,346
Squid, Critter, I lost it.

639
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,281
- Fuckin' sleep.
- Lost what?

640
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:13,716
My picture, the money,
my phone,

641
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:15,718
- it's all gone.
- Listen, I think Tracy might...

642
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,453
I think it must
have fell over at the laundromat.

643
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,554
I looked.
I went through everything.

644
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,322
I already messed up
with the kit...

645
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,558
- I'm so mad. I can't tell her.
- Listen, calm down.

646
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,726
We're gonna find the money.

647
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:25,995
How? It's lost. I can't.

648
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,373
I can fix it.

649
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,409
I'm gonna fix it.

650
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,346
Watch her.

651
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,550
So, uh, how far is your house?

652
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:26,996
Uh, you want to tell me
why you left?

653
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:30,526
My stepmother's a bitch.

654
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,695
What? It's true.

655
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:35,898
I'm sorry,
the word doesn't fit your face.

656
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:38,567
Well, she is.

657
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,670
Not much of a reason to leave.

658
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:47,843
Her kid, Brendan, he's 17.

659
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:49,845
He uh...

660
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:52,481
Did stuff to me.

661
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,753

Oh, my God, Elly.

We have been so worried.
Where have you been?

676
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,622
Who is this?

677
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,595
I said, who are you?

678
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,164
He's my friend.

679
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,732
He's not your friend, Elly, do you hear me?
He's not your friend.

680
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:54,470
- Did you take her?
- He didn't take me.

681
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:57,940
Do you know
how old Elly is? Hmm?

682
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,642
She's 13 years old.

683
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,211
You have taken a child,

684
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:04,347
- and put her in danger...
- He didn't.

685
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,482
- I swear to God, if you hurt her...
- He didn't.

686
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:09,151
Look, I don't know
who you are,

687
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,986
or what you think you're doing,

688
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,855
but you're not doing it
with my daughter.

689
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,123
I'm not your daughter.

690
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,059
Okay, Elly,
that's enough.

691
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:19,027
You are staying here,

692
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:22,631
and this boy is leaving. Now!

693
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:23,732
I'm calling the police.

694
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:26,602
She wants to leave.

695
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,170
She's not gonna stay here with
you and your fucking kid, so...

696
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:30,689
- Don't...
- Yes. Hello.

697
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,207
- I'd like to report a...
- You want to know why she ran away?

698
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,677
It's cause your fucking kid,
Brian, or Brandon or whatever

699
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,246
the fuck his name is,
was raping her.

700
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,286
You knew, didn't you?

701
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:48,824
Um, no, I'm sorry.

702
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,099
You're lying.

703
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,835
Look, I know that you have
brainwashed her into thinking

704
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:02,170
- that what you are, and whatever you do...
- He didn't.

705
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:04,873
- ...is more exciting than living here...
- I'm not lying.

706
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,810
...and going to school,
but it is my job to protect her.

707
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:12,915
Okay. Then call her dad.
Tell him what happened.

708
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,284
Tell him she's okay.

709
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:20,943
You're protecting
yourself.

710
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,260
Let's go.

711
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,563
Elly, I...

712
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,184
So we're in Reno, huh,
my dad's trailer, right.

713
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:52,287
My dad is so fucking drunk,
he can't even get a bead and

714
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:55,090
then all of a sudden...

715
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,025
Blasts a hole through the side
of the trailer.

716
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:01,630
Fucking tears apart the
cardboard Christmas fireplace,

717
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:04,666
and I pick up a beer and I smash
him right in the side of the head,

718
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:06,602
and we're out!
And he's screaming,

719
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,671
"Get back here, you cocksucker!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!"

720
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:11,873
And Scabius shits his pants.
The end!

721
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,775
No, no, no, man.
So I'm sitting here,

722
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,078
drinking with ass scratch,
right, and he says to me,

723
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,347
"You can't take that shit
sitting down," right.

724
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:21,283
So we get this thing
of gasoline,

725
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,218
throw it all over the fucking car,
over the roof, the hood and everything,

726
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:26,188
and his guy hands
me a Molotov,

727
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,190
lights that shit, and just
like the movies,

728
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:29,992
I chuck that son-of-a-bitch up,

729
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:34,796
"Aah! Boom!"
flames of destruction, everywhere.

730
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,166
That was an anarchist piece
of fucking art, man!

731
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:42,170
It was beautiful. I've been in LA
looking for your ass a month now.

732
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:44,406
You and me,
we're gonna have some fun, huh?

733
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:47,342
Maybe go back out to Reno,
fuck shit up a little bit.

734
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:52,381
- You're gonna fucking leave...
- Aah! I'd never leave you, bro.

735
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,117
What's up? I'm Scabius.

736
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,985
I know you.

737
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,382
You know, you should
draw more shit like this.

738
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:29,985
Like more demons and skulls
and fucking hard shit.

739
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,920
I mean, you should try
to appeal to more,

740
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:33,288
like an adult audience,
you know.

741
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:38,026
Like, you should draw, like,
only, like, real shit.

742
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,895
None of this cartoon shit,
you know.

743
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,577
You should stay on your side
of the street.

744
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:43,732
Okay.

745
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,001
Whatever, fuckhead.

746
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,455
- Get your sketchbook?
- Yes.

747
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,192
Come on, Germ,
I'll walk you.

748
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:15,831
We don't have to go to Portland,
you know. We can go wherever.

749
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,033
There's trains up to Vancouver.

750
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,435
Then you can find the house.

751
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,196
Can't you guys just wait
till she comes back?

752
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,138
Why is that so hard?

753
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:28,210
- Listen, Eeyore, Tracy's not...
- Just come with us.

754
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:29,411
Germ needs a babysitter.

755
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:30,846
I'm not leaving Tracy.

756
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:53,142
You're stronger than you think.

757
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,979
Hey, take care of her.

758
01:03:05,516 --> 01:03:06,848
That's what I do.

759
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:31,106

01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:56,031
Starbucks in the cubicle,
and fucking back again.

767
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:58,434
These fuckers, any one of them

768
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:00,836
could just hop up on that empty curb
and be home in five fucking minutes,

769
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,872
safe and dry, not like us revolutionaries,
though, right, Eeyore?

770
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,207
We don't care if we get wet!

771
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,276
It's futile, man!

772
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,078
Fucking futile!

773
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,881

775
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:19,087
What the fuck are you doing,
Eeyore?

776
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:20,422
- I was just...
- That's not cool.

777
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,224

- Eeyore.

01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:23,625

779
01:04:24,595 --> 01:04:26,127
Fuck you, I am not.

780
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,473
Eeyore.

781
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,088
It's okay. I've done it before.

01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,341
That'd be fucking crazy.

789
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:48,710

01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:55,650

Right!

792
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:04,359

793
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:08,596
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,476
Whoa!

798
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,078
Yeah!

799
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,679
Critter.

800
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,482
Critter, do something!

801
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,617
Scabius!

802
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:31,286
Scabius!

803
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:32,654
You're fucking going
to kill him!

804
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:51,106
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

805
01:06:54,578 --> 01:06:58,313
I'm sorry.

806
01:06:58,315 --> 01:06:59,748
Get the fuck
out of here!

807
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:02,350
I said, go fuck!

808
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,286
Fucking stay out!

809
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:10,158
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

810
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,809
Whoa, give me another one.

811
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:07,082
Come on, come on,
one more!

812
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:13,421
Yo, creature,
got an inspiration, man.

813
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,857
How about we hitch back to Reno,
take Eeyore with us,

814
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:17,425
see what kind of throwing arm
she's got,

815
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,860
light one for the revolution.

816
01:08:20,564 --> 01:08:22,730
Whoo. Bullseye.

817
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:27,168
Reno, man, we're gonna fucking kill it!
Reno!

818
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,806
- Man, fuck Reno.
- What?

819
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:33,408
Is that the only shit
you've ever done?

820
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:35,877
Blow up a car in fucking Reno?

821
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,147
You're always talking
about that shit.

822
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:40,482
Yeah, man,
cause it was anarchy, man!

823
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:42,117
Man, fuck anarchy!

824
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,152
Fine.

825
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:46,521
Yo, come on,
us fighters got to stick together, man.

826
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:48,323
For the paradise,
for the proletariat...

827
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:51,226
Goddamn, grow the fuck up, man,
all of that is bullshit.

828
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:53,761
And get your fucking hand
off of Eeyore, man.

829
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:05,773
Yo, where are you going, man?
Yo, Critter!

830
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,844
Come on, man, what the fuck?

831
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:56,357
Hey.

832
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:10,238
- Does it hurt?
- Fuck off.

833
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:14,676
- I can make you feel better...
- Get off of me!

834
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,612
If you weren't hanging on
everybody all the time,

835
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,847
I wouldn't have so many fucking problems,
you fucking poser!

836
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,350
- I'm not a poser.
- All you gotta do is go home.

837
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:24,352
And Mommy's gonna give you
a fat, sloppy hug

838
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:26,521
- and say, "Oh, we were so fucking scared..."
- My mom died.

839
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:29,390
Yeah, big fucking deal!
My dad tried to kill me.

840
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,560
And street girl saved you, huh?

841
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,463
Saw an opportunity, decided to turn
you into a little fucking Orphan Annie

842
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,432
- moneymaker, huh?
- She did not.

843
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,050
Took all your cash while
you were sleeping

844
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:40,667
- and put it in her arm.
- Fuck you, you don't even know know.

845
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,270
Yeah, but Critter does.

846
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,871
He told me.

847
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:46,007
You're a liar.

848
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,643
You know I'm not.

849
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:51,579
Nobody wants you here,
all right?

850
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,415
- Just go home and watch your fucking TV.
- I can't.

851
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,454
- I...
- Get the fuck out of here.

852
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:01,689
Go!

853
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:02,890
You want me to fuck you up?

854
01:11:03,994 --> 01:11:05,627
Beat it, you fucking twerp!

855
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:08,563
Jesus fucking Christ!

856
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:20,775
Eeyore!

857
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:41,429
Elly!

858
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:46,768
Elly!

859
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:50,371
Eeyore! Hey!

860
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:52,073
- What do you want?
- Hey.

861
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,609
- Get back.
- Stop, stop.

862
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:57,345
- Okay, stop, stop.
- Fuck you!

863
01:11:57,347 --> 01:11:59,580
- Fuck you!
- Okay, stop yelling.

864
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,883
- What, so you can lie to me again?
- No.

865
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,352
I took the money.

866
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,587
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna lie.

867
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,057
Here. Here. Okay?

868
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:10,325
Look at what I have.

869
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,449
You take this. Take it, okay?

870
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,939
We're gonna go there together.
Just like you wanted.

871
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:15,429
- You said you were my friend.
- I am.

872
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:17,565
You're not anybody's friend.
You don't know how.

873
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:19,033
- You left.
- I came back.

874
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:21,469
So you could leave me again,
like you leave everybody.

875
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:24,038
- Like you left Angie.
- Shut up. Shut up!

876
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,807
You left her.
You left your sister.

877
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:27,642
Shut the fuck up!

878
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:28,710
You left her!

879
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:30,712
After whatever happened
to you,

880
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:33,348
you said you wouldn't
leave her, right?

881
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,616
Just like you told me.

882
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:37,452
You're a liar.

883
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:46,761
You're right.

884
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:50,665
I am a liar.

885
01:12:52,102 --> 01:12:53,701
I'm not a good friend.

886
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,637
I was using you.

887
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:59,040
This is a fucking picture

888
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,509
from a magazine, Elly!

889
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:03,077
It's not real.

890
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:07,148
- I don't fucking like you!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

891
01:13:11,121 --> 01:13:13,955
I'm not coming back.

892
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:16,457
I'm not lying this time.

893
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,393
Wait.

894
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,628
Please don't go. Don't leave me.

895
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,032
Tracy!

896
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,670
Tracy, I'm sorry.

897
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,683
You know, you need dope,
I could get it for you.

898
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:46,921
I don't have to like all
of my customers, you know.

899
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:52,427
I'll even spot you some.

900
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:57,532
Yeah?

901
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,667
Yeah.

902
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:02,770
Come on.

903
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:35,229
Take me with you.

904
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:38,099
Juan Carlo doesn't
exactly love you.

905
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,001
You're gonna make me
wait longer?

906
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:41,068
Come on.
They're gonna be up there.

907
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,637
For real.

908
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:44,539
You want me to end up
with nothing again?

909
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:47,241
Yeah, fine.

910
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:48,709
I'll be an hour.

911
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,714
He's cool, right?

912
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,319
Yeah. He's cool.

913
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:05,693
Scabius, huh?

914
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:08,029
Like the parasite?

915
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:20,808
<i>♪ Well, my belly's just aching</i>

916
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:26,247
<i>♪ For a couple strips of bacon</i>

917
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:34,221
<i>♪ Hunk of pork

918
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:41,028
<i>♪ What can I do? ♪</i>

919
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:52,740
Hey, Tracy. Tracy?

920
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:53,908
Hey, I got some Oxy.

921
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:56,177
Tide you over a little bit.

922
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,679
You want me to crush it up?

923
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:01,916
I'll use your knife.

924
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:09,824
I'll do it.

925
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:15,096
What if you decide
not to share with me?

926
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:17,064
I don't know you.

927
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:18,899
I don't know you either.

928
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:23,037
And I'm the one
sharing my hard-earned drugs.

929
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:31,412
Come on. I'll give it back.
I promise.

930
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:32,680
God.

931
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:35,282
What?

932
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:36,684
I'll just go all the
way upstairs,

933
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,085
get my fucking grinder
and do it myself.

934
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:39,153
Hey.

935
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:04,011
See?

936
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:10,251
Ladies first.

937
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:17,124
Ha ha. You like that shit, huh?-

938
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:24,899
Whoo.

939
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,335
Uh.

940
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:47,822
I'm sorry about the...

941
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:49,423
The parasite joke.

942
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:55,896
Ah. We all feed off
of each other.

943
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,499
You know, me...

944
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:00,101
Off all of this...

945
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,037
And you off of Critter.

946
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:05,840
I get it.

947
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:08,927
You know, if you ask me,

948
01:19:08,928 --> 01:19:10,488
you're getting the good end
of the deal.

949
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:15,182
Maybe.

950
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,487
Yeah.

951
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:29,530
It really rubs me the wrong way
when people use my friends.

952
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:34,135
All right.
Fuck this.

953
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:35,803
Yeah. Fuck this, right?

954
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:40,441
Where the fuck
do you think you're going, huh?

955
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:45,179
You're the fucking
parasite. You know that?

956
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:48,315
You keep scaring everyone away, you bitch!

957
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:52,186
Yeah. Never fucking come back.

958
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:56,557
Please don't. Don't!

959
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:59,326
Just like him.
I'm just like him.

960
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:00,895
- I'm fucking better than him.
- Stop!

961
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,839
<i>Every day that I work,</i>

962
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:13,874
<i>I get a gram and Taco Bell.</i>

963
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:28,122
I get my own room.

964
01:20:28,124 --> 01:20:30,457
And you don't talk to me
when I'm not working.

965
01:20:33,563 --> 01:20:36,397
What is this shit for now, like,
some webcam shit?

966
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:43,137
Don't give me a stupid name.

967
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,875
Got yourself a deal, butterfly.

968
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,587
Your office.

969
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:01,956
You want a Pop-Tart?

970
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,198
Wait till you see what I found.

971
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:07,027
We are gonna make thousands.

972
01:21:12,134 --> 01:21:13,400
Get that thing off me.

973
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:21,342
- Hit me up.
- Shut up.

974
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:24,178
Hit yourself.

975
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:29,149
So, quick rehearsal.

976
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:31,552
You found her diary.
You know her secrets.

977
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,187
Fuck this!

978
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:36,423
Fine. We go handheld.

979
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:44,131
I can't.

980
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:45,466
Oh, come on. Really?

981
01:21:46,269 --> 01:21:48,402
You wanna be here, right?

982
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,137
She wants to be here.

983
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:52,473
Old enough to know
what you want? Hmm?

984
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,642
- Yeah.
- She's old enough.

985
01:21:54,644 --> 01:21:56,677
So, I don't see
what the problem is.

986
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:59,413
I've got snacks,
there's a nice hot shower, TV.

987
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,048
You can even use the pool.

988
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:07,087
Not with her.

989
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,256
- We have a verbal agreement.
- I know. I'm sorry.

990
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,425
We have a deal!

991
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,193
I didn't force you
to come here, Tracy.

992
01:22:13,195 --> 01:22:15,596
Down there in Santa Monica,
when I found you,

993
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:18,532
I've never seen you like that.

994
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:21,467
So, I offered to help,
to keep you safe, protect you.

995
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:25,005
Who do this
to your face, hmm?

996
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,708
It could have been anyone.

997
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,576
It's brutal out there.
Is that what you want?

998
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:32,112
You walk out that door,
this is what you're gonna get.

999
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,149
Stay here with me,
I'll keep you taken care of.

1000
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:38,018
- This is bullshit.
- This is a gift.

1001
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,220
I'm giving you a fucking gift!

1002
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:44,024
If it's not you,
it'll be someone else.

1003
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:51,332
I understand you're nervous.

1004
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:54,885
It's easy.

1005
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,537
Now it's a rehearsal, then just do
the same thing over and over again.

1006
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,540
You can do that.

1007
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:00,607
Right?

1008
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,477
It's okay, Tracy.

1009
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:10,050
Uh-uh. After.

1010
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:13,354
Fine.

1011
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:22,196
See? We can always make a deal.

1012
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:31,270
- Run!
- I'm not leaving without you!

1013
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:32,339
Fucking run!

1014
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:03,070
Tracy, what the fuck
are you doing?

1015
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:05,172
- I'm waking him up.
- Hold on.

1016
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:07,273
God, you're such a fucking
wussy. Come on. Get up.

1017
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:08,575
- Get up.
- Tracy, he's my friend.

1018
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:10,344
Your friend kicked Eeyore
out on the street.

1019
01:24:10,346 --> 01:24:11,578
I didn't fucking kick her out.

1020
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,697
- Where'd she go then?
- I don't fucking know.

1021
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:15,815
She was about to start turning tricks
out there, you fuck, because of you...

1022
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:17,384
- You brought her here.
- Come on.

1023
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,286
So what?

1024
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:21,187
You really think
you're taking care of her?

1025
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,556
You're a fucking junkie.

1026
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:28,796
Right.

1027
01:24:28,798 --> 01:24:31,398
You're all just fucking better
human beings than me, huh?

1028
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,334
But just so you fucking know,
your friend there

1029
01:24:34,336 --> 01:24:36,470
threw me up against that wall
and raped me

1030
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:38,305
while you were off
on your last score.

1031
01:24:40,376 --> 01:24:41,809
- That's bullshit.
- What you did to me,

1032
01:24:41,811 --> 01:24:44,211
that's bullshit? Huh?
That's bullshit?

1033
01:24:44,814 --> 01:24:46,530
Yeah.

1034
01:24:46,531 --> 01:24:48,247
You wanna look at me
and tell me that?

1035
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,618
Come on. Look at me. Look at me.

1036
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,587
Come on. Fuck you! Look at me.

1037
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,189
Look at me, you little bitch!

1038
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:57,858
Didn't you tell me how you
take care of everyone?"

1039
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,727
'Cause I don't see you
saying shit.

1040
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:03,397
Would you go into his bag,
get me my knife?

1041
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:06,166
No?

1042
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:16,777
Well, you fucking deserved it.

1043
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:20,781
Tracy.

1044
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,783
Tracy!

1045
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,518
- Stop it.
- I hate you!

1046
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,819
Stop!

1047
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:01,555
<i>Before Brendan...</i>

1048
01:26:03,526 --> 01:26:04,925
<i>Before my mom died...</i>

1049
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:07,828
And before everything...

1050
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,081
She would bring me up here

1051
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:12,665
and teach me the names
of the flowers.

1052
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:20,507
I can't take care of you.

1053
01:26:22,878 --> 01:26:23,944
I know.

1054
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:28,515
You have to tell your dad.

1055
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:32,786
He won't believe me.

1056
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:35,856
He will.

1057
01:26:38,627 --> 01:26:39,960
I can't.

1058
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:45,332
He will.
Okay. Trust me.

1059
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,604
Your dad loves you.

1060
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,777
You said nobody loves anyone.

1061
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:56,837
Dad?

1062
01:28:18,394 --> 01:28:21,328
<i>This is the story of the girl
who saved me.</i>
