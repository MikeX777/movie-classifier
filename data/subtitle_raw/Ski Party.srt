1
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>Snow in the mountains,</i>
<i>really something to see</i>

2
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,569
<i>so wax up your skis</i>
<i>and come along with me</i>

3
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,406
<i>we're all gassed up</i>
<i>and ready to leave</i>

4
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,175
<i>so pick me up about</i>
<i>quarter to three</i>

5
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,545
<i>after skiing all day</i>
<i>and parties at night</i>

6
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,581
<i>with 5 feet of snow,</i>
<i>what a beautiful sight</i>

7
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,085
<i>there's plenty of chicks,</i>
<i>enough for everyone</i>

8
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,988
<i>and even the beginners</i>
<i>will be having fun</i>

9
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>the d.j's are saying that</i>
<i>the snow reports are good</i>

10
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,595
<i>we'll get some alcohol</i>
<i>and put it under my hood</i>

11
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,665
<i>we're being left alone</i>
<i>like a ski party should</i>

12
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,301
<i>we'd stay about a</i>
<i>month if we could</i>

13
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,404
<i>after skiing all day</i>
<i>and parties at night</i>

14
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,574
<i>with 5 feet of snow,</i>
<i>what a beautiful sight</i>

15
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>there's plenty of chicks,</i>
<i>enough for everyone</i>

16
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,181
<i>and even the beginners</i>
<i>will be having fun</i>

17
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,203
<i>there'll be groovy</i>
<i>little chicks</i>

18
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,838
<i>with sweaters real tight</i>

19
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>skiing all day and</i>
<i>having parties at night</i>

20
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,211
<i>gonna ride every lift</i>
<i>while it's still light</i>

21
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,413
<i>we won't be seeing</i>
<i>the sights</i>

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,450
<i>after skiing all day</i>
<i>and parties at night</i>

23
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,353
<i>with 5 feet of snow,</i>
<i>what a beautiful sight</i>

24
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,189
<i>there's plenty of chicks,</i>
<i>enough or everyone</i>

25
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,359
<i>and even the beginners</i>
<i>will be having fun</i>

26
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,295
<i>let's have a ski party</i>

27
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,898
<i>let's have a sky party</i>

28
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,411
...and so we see the male
becomes the most romantic

29
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,414
between the ages
of 17 and 19.

30
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,682
Sounds like
my mating call.

31
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,251
Mine's
much noisier.

32
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,353
While the female
doesn't reach her

33
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,722
romantic peak until
her 35th year.

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,492
This, as we can
well imagine

35
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,795
presents certain social problems for the college male

36
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:47,433
such as extreme anxiety, frustration, tension.

37
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,270
All we have to do is find a 35-year-old girl

38
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,372
who doesn't yet qualify under medicare--

39
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,241
sure, there's lots of those gals around.
Just gotta dig a little.

40
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,242
Well, sure.

41
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,511
In the ground,
they're buried everywhere.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,248
Girls, girls,
girls, listen,

43
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,450
i'll tell you
what i'm gonna do

44
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,052
i'll race you to the locker room

45
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,288
and the first girl there gets to buy me dinner.

46
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,760
Hi, men.

47
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,095
Hi!

48
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,300
How does
freddie do it?

49
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,237
We all go to the same school, right?

50
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,305
Right.

51
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,941
Then what are we doing wrong that he's doing right?

52
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,475
I don't know,
why don't we ask him?

53
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,777
Think he'd
tell us?

54
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,580
I don't know. If you were him,
would you tell us?

55
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,883
No,
would you?

56
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,618
No, but it'll give me a good excuse

57
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,286
to break his nose when he doesn't.

58
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,488
Oh, great,
that'll solve all our problems.

59
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,457
That's what john wayne would do.

60
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,626
I don't care what john wayne would do.

61
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,828
Well, i dig him.
We're the same kinda guy.

62
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,396
Sure, you are.
We are.

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,965
You know the shaving commercial he does?

64
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,099
Yeah.

65
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,968
We use the same blade exposure, number 5.

66
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,309
Will you look at that?

67
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,844
He's at
it again.

68
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,279
How do you
figure it?

69
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,086
Here we are,
breaking our bones

70
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,321
playing basketball,
football, baseball,

71
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,524
track, and that bum fools around in swimming, tennis,

72
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,361
the chess team, the bridge team.
Hey, wait a minute.

73
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,162
That's it.

74
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,097
That's what?

75
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,498
Don't
you see?

76
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,500
We've been playin' in front of the girls,
he plays with them.

77
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,002
You can say
that again.

78
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,370
How stupid
can 2 guys be?

79
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,005
Todd, let's go
beat him up.

80
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,873
We'll feel better.
Less frustrated.

81
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,009
Calm down, buddy.
Save your energy.

82
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,343
I've finally
done it for us.

83
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,544
Like what? What?

84
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,614
2 dates in a row
with the same girls.

85
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,617
Not those 2 beatniks we met
at the ban the bomb meeting?

86
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,387
No, no. Linda
and barbara.

87
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,323
Linda hughes and barbara norris,
you're kidding?

88
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,358
Great.
Where are we taking the girls tonight?

89
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,194
Tonight?
The date's 2 weeks from next thursday.

90
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,166
<i>...when i tell you this,</i>

91
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,403
<i>but i have been a woman</i>
<i>a long, long time</i>

92
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>and never have i felt</i>
<i>like the way i do</i>

93
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,541
<i>when you kiss me.</i>

94
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,344
Oh, she's too much.

95
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,654
Stop it, will you?
Haven't you ever seen

96
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,456
2 people make love
in a sink before?

97
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,658
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,662
<i>First,
i will start with your toes.</i>

99
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,664
Dry them off first,
dry them off.

100
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,601
Very funny.
$6.85 down the drain.

101
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,604
Will you just listen to those 2 laughing back there?

102
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,406
We gotta be doing
something wrong.

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,208
They don't take
us seriously.

104
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,443
What would
freddie do?

105
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,413
First of all,
he'd get the girls to pay for the tickets.

106
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,421
At least we
learned something.

107
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,390
What's that?

108
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,626
The food,
water and climate must be terrific in rome.

109
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,195
Just look at
that great shape

110
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,430
that 35-year-old sexpot's in.

111
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,233
Man, she doesn't
look a day over 19.

112
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,937
Hang on, buddy,
the evening's young.

113
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,612
Be back
in a minute.

114
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,918
Arthur?

115
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,420
Arthur?

116
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,655
Hey, arthur?

117
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,624
Are you a cop,

118
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,260
or somebody who has really run out of gas?

119
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,497
Neither. It's me, todd.
Todd armstrong.

120
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,731
Pull up
a little.

121
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,501
What for?
I'm doing all right.

122
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,469
No, you idiot,
the car.

123
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,504
Oh!

124
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,074
Ask stanley
to pull back.

125
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,509
Come on, arthur.

126
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,344
All right.

127
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,314
Would you excuse
me for a moment,

128
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,549
prof. Roberts?

129
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,557
All right,
now listen.

130
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,725
The last time,
linda and i took a walk

131
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,561
and left you and
barbara the car.

132
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,728
Are you sure?

133
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,363
Positive.
Don't you remember?

134
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,565
When you tried
to kiss her,

135
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,533
she burnt your nose with her cigarette.

136
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,336
Oh, yeah. Then it's my turn.
How long do you think--

137
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,637
half an hour.

138
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,806
Half an hour!
Hey, it's cold out tonight.

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,540
Shh!

140
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,009
20 minutes, ok?

141
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,111
Ok. Synchronize
your watch.

142
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,548
11:12 and
30 seconds.

143
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,784
11:12 and
30 seconds.

144
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,253
That's
35 seconds.

145
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,755
11:12 and
35 seconds.

146
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,357
11:12 and 40.

147
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,658
11:12 and--

148
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,527
todd, it's just you and me out here.

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,562
Who are we
trying to kid?

150
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,773
I'm getting
out of here!

151
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,908
Oh!

152
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,942
Hey!

153
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,578
Come on, todd!

154
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,580
Todd, stop!

155
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,850
Stop that! Help!

156
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,652
Don't, todd!

157
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,791
Now what's
the matter?

158
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,059
You're
kidding.

159
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,628
Italian movies.

160
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,597
You've been reading
too many books, todd.

161
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,266
But i don't
understand.

162
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,268
Why won't you
let me kiss you?

163
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,837
I don't know,
i--i just don't feel like it.

164
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,605
But why? I
mean, look,

165
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,808
i'm a nice,
clean-cut american boy with a c-plus average.

166
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,777
Oh, look,

167
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,646
i don't know why.

168
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,648
With you, i just
don't feel it.

169
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,918
You mean, not
like freddie, huh?

170
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,787
Oh!

171
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,690
Oh, well,
freddie...

172
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,259
oh, well, freddie.

173
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,697
2,190.

174
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,966
Boy, we are a
couple of losers.

175
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,968
We couldn't even
kiss 'em goodnight.

176
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,469
Kiss them
goodnight?

177
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,905
We couldn't even walk them to the front door.

178
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,675
2,191--
i don't get it.

179
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,776
They said
they like us.

180
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,644
I heard
them say it.

181
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,845
2,192...

182
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,646
hey,

183
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,283
are you sure you weren't listening to the radio?

184
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,989
2,194.

185
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,692
Hey, craig, look
who's coming.

186
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,694
Who? Who? Who?

187
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,097
I promised your housemother

188
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,099
to have you
back before dawn.

189
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,801
Mr. Operator.

190
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,979
Janet, please!
Let me go.

191
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,948
Leave her alone,
you dirty young man, you!

192
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,249
Yeah!

193
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,553
My lips are
exhausted.

194
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,688
Look, you'll have another date with me

195
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,957
again sometime
soon, i promise.

196
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,959
Before we
graduate, anyway.

197
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,695
Just another 5 minutes.
Please, freddie.

198
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,965
Look, we'll have a whole week in the snow together.

199
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,834
Oh, sure,
with indian

200
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,969
and barbara norris
and linda hughes

201
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,704
and all the
rest of them.

202
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,506
A lot of fun
that'll be.

203
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,012
Oh, freddie, do
we have to go?

204
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,047
Yes! Look, janet,

205
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,715
i am president
of the ski club.

206
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,717
If i'm not there
to see that things

207
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,853
run smoothly,
then who will?

208
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,887
Mmm-mmm!

209
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,159
Todd.

210
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,927
Oh, they'll be
back in a week.

211
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,029
Maybe they'll
forget us.

212
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,498
Start packing
warm clothes.

213
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,832
You're kidding.

214
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,733
I'm not
kidding.

215
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,068
But why?

216
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,736
Look, don't argue.
Opportunity is knocking.

217
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,739
Isn't this our first chance to
get involved in a girl-boy sport?

218
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,942
That's not what you're thinking about.
It's the girls.

219
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,744
What girls?
Barbara and linda.

220
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,212
Here we finally
get a 2nd date

221
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,881
with a couple of
beautiful girls.

222
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,749
If they spend a week without us,
in the snow

223
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,918
with freddie, we'll
never see 'em again.

224
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,753
Then what are
we waiting for?

225
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,889
Oh, unless you'd rather hang around here

226
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,591
during mid-term vacation doing push-ups.

227
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,427
You're right.

228
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,761
Oh, uh, uh...

229
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,362
todd.

230
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,196
Yeah?

231
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,230
One problem.

232
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,231
What's that?

233
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,367
We don't know
how to ski.

234
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,202
Don't.
Don't know who,

235
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,805
don't know how.
Did that stop edison?

236
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,940
Did that stop
alexander graham bell?

237
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,043
Oh, well,
as long as those 2 guys are coming.

238
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,979
Just so long as we're not going to be the only 2 there

239
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,114
who don't
know how.

240
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,148
Start packing.

241
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,456
Sunshine,
lollipops and rainbows

242
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,258
everything that's
wonderful is what i feel

243
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,594
when we're together

244
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,397
brighter than
a lucky penny

245
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,000
when you're near,
the rain cloud disappears, dear

246
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,002
and i feel so fine

247
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,805
just to know
that you are mine

248
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,843
my life is sunshine,
lollipops and rainbows

249
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,145
that's how this
refrain goes

250
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,914
so come on,
join in, everybody!

251
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,017

come your way

254
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,892

sunshine,
lollipops and rainbows

256
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,801
everything that's
wonderful is what i feel

257
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,870
when we're together

258
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,873
brighter than
a lucky penny

259
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,842
when you're near,
the rain cloud disappears, dear

260
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,878
and i feel so fine

261
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,847
just to know
that you are mine

262
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,118
my life is sunshine,
lollipops and rainbows

263
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,654
that's how this
refrain goes

264
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,856
so come on,
join in, everybody!

265
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,326
Sunshine,
lollipops and rainbows

266
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,862
everything
that's wonderful

267
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,064
is sure to
come your way

268
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,833
'cause you're in love

269
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,835
you're in love

270
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,839
and love is here to stay

271
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,705
oh, todd!

272
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,586
Oh, just smell
that air.

273
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,120
Look at
the snow.

274
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,556
Look at
that blood.

275
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,997
Well, hi
there, gang.

276
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,101
Gang, welcome. Welcome
to your ski country

277
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,203
where boys
become men

278
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,271
look on
the steps.

279
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,139
It's a bird.
It's a plane.

280
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,007
It's a creep.

281
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,478
Please hurry,
i do not have all day here.

282
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,779
We have
several...

283
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,714
ah.

284
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,148
Now, in there...

285
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,452
is the
infirmary...

286
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,621
how'd he figure that out?

287
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,090
Where we have 3
full-time doctors

288
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,726
setting an average of about 9 broken legs a day.

289
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,095
And, uh,
how are they on broken necks?

290
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,596
Or
black eyes?

291
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,100
We might
just find out.

292
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,802
Now, then,
shall we get to living arrangements?

293
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,571
Oh, i am delighted
to report

294
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,772
that i
have received

295
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,974
letters from all the fathers of the boys

296
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,011
informing me that chaperones would not be necessary.

297
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,812
I like that.

298
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,982
Unfortunately, i have received no similar letters

299
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,518
from the fathers
of the girls.

300
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,187
Therefore, we shall employ the honor system.

301
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,591
Hey, that's great. You trust us and,
in return, we behave.

302
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,192
Just like
west point, right?

303
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,695
Wrong, more
like sing sing.

304
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,664
The boys will be
over here--

305
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,798
oh!

306
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,667
To the right
in rooms 205,

307
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,302
206...

308
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,979
be careful,
this is all very carefully arranged.

309
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,047
Here, now.

310
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,317
It's a tape.
Mail-order psychoanalysis.

311
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,789
Operation
screwball.

312
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,059
But there will be 2 of you to a room, and...

313
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,226
uh, uh...

314
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,795
are you sure?

315
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,830
Of course i'm sure.
I've got it all--

316
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,233
i mean about my father writing you a letter.
He can't write.

317
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,435
His father
can't write.

318
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,072
He only went as far as the 2nd grade,
then he got married.

319
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,074
The--the
2nd grade?

320
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,043
To his teacher.
You know her, todd, my mother.

321
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,645
Oh, yeah.

322
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,213
That nice lady i say hello to
every time i go to your house.

323
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,082
Yeah. Her. My mother.
Your mother.

324
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,086
Would you wait just a moment, please?

325
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,054
Now, look.
The 2nd grade?

326
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,489
That is utterly
impossible.

327
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,258
Oh no, no, it isn't.
He was big for his age.

328
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,760
Yeah, his age.

329
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,762
Oh. Uh, uh...

330
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,097
how old was he?

331
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,432
Or--or
shouldn't i ask?

332
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,268
Either 18 or 23.

333
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,537
It's kind of hard to
tell with my father.

334
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,872
He's got
good bones.

335
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,073
Good bones.

336
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,684
Go--go find--find
your own room.

337
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,652
I-i just
have to...

338
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,289
i've got a hunch he won't be around much longer...

339
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,558
to lock us in our rooms at night.

340
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,094
I see.
I see.

341
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,096
Not as much
as i do.

342
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,165
Oh, wow.

343
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,301
Where are our bathing suits, bobby?

344
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,137
In the green overnight bag, gene.

345
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,306
Um, we'll see
you kids later.

346
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,141
Much later.

347
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,309
I, uh, i
think i'll

348
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,878
get a little more comfortable, myself.

349
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,147
Yeah, that's a
good idea.

350
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,315
Maybe we forgot to brush after breakfast.

351
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,117
Will you just
look at that?

352
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,219
Yes, with just one
thing on their minds.

353
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,320
2.

354
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,323
You're right, indian,
that's all they think of.

355
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,792
What are we
waiting for?

356
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,261
We've got bikinis,
too. Come on.

357
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,163
But i didn't bring
my bathing suit.

358
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,099
That's all right.
I'll lend you a pair of shoelaces.

359
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,200
This is war!

360
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,177

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,145

362
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,148

364
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,619

every time

377
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,189

384
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,209
say that you
want me to stay

385
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,278
and i'll never
go away

386
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,048
and there's lots,
lots more where that came from

387
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,585

388
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,256

lots more where that came from

389
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,693

390
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,863

391
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,266
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,768
Yeah.

393
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,037
Gene, she says yes
to everything.

394
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,239
I know.
Something's wrong.

395
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,407
What's your
name, honey?

396
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,243
My name is nita.
What is yours?

397
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,246
No wonder she's so friendly,
she's a southerner.

398
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,582
Say, what part of the south are you from, popcorn?

399
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,918
I am from
stockholm.

400
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:46,919
Stockholm?

401
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,266
All right, please, gang.
Please, gang.

402
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,434
Here are the orders of the day.

403
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,536
Here's what
we're going to do.

404
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,438
In the first place,
i am delighted...

405
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,973
jack! Jack!

406
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,310
Firstly, i'm delighted to tell you

407
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,312
that advanced ski instruction will commence

408
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,314
in exactly...

409
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,050
52 minutes on
slope number 5

410
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,118
for those of our
fellows from the gang

411
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,288
who'd like to brush up for tomorrow morning's activity.

412
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,258
Now, then,
for our pretties over here, ha ha.

413
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,426
We all... oh, yeah.

414
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,460
Oh, yeah.

415
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,765
We have ski instruction for our pretty ladies

416
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,467
on slope number 6.

417
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,302
Now, then, it
does look like

418
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,738
a rather good
day, doesn't it?

419
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,574
So, let's all go and have fun, fun, fun, hey?

420
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,913
Jeez, don't.

421
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,381
Oh, freddie,
i just love...

422
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,653
why doesn't she leave him alone?

423
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,688
Yeah,
and give us a chance.

424
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,790
I can't look down.

425
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,092
Why not?

426
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,893
My eyeballs
are frozen.

427
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,365
I've heard of 2 guys being close friends,

428
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,433
but this is
ridiculous.

429
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,103
Hey, where
you going?

430
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,938
Back to the lodge.
I just forgot something.

431
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,805
What's that?

432
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,873
I'm a coward.

433
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,342
Come on, craig,
we're only gonna practice.

434
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,345
"Practice."
The last time i heard that was from a football coach

435
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,981
and 10 minutes later,
i had a broken collarbone.

436
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,428
Todd?

437
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,397
Yeah?

438
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,399
Forget it.

439
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,407
A little late,
boys, aren't you?

440
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,642
You and ollie
show us how to bring

441
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,678
an injured skier
off the mountain.

442
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,085
Very sloppy.

443
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,092
Sloppy.
Very sloppy.

444
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,562
Now, let's see if you 2 boys can do a little better than...

445
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,165
<i>achtung!</i>
<i>Voss ich losch!</i>

446
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,434
Boys, boys, come back.

447
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,868
Where are you going?

448
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,604
Ach, just like
stalingrad.

449
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,441
<i>Achtung!</i>
I say, halt!

450
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,444
Coward, this is
your last chance!

451
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,715
I feel like we're in the middle of a world war ii movie.

452
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,623
What's that?

453
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,192
Sounded like
girls laughing.

454
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,627
We must be near
the swiss border.

455
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,630
Now we are going to learn how to do the snowplow.

456
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,599
First we pick up
our poles this way

457
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,201
and we bend
our knees

458
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,470
and point our inner edges in,
this way.

459
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,805
Bend your knees
and bob up and down.

460
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,644
Ah.

461
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,547
This must be
the place.

462
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,715
Yeah, slope 6.

463
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,883
Oh, boy.

464
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,652
Craig, now that's the
way to learn how to ski.

465
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,654
Nice and easy
and slow.

466
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,591
Yeah. Yeah, it's too
bad we're not girls.

467
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:16,061
You know, a few lessons here,
in the basic fundamentals

468
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,497
and we'd be able to clobber freddie,
like that!

469
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,265
You really think we could catch on that fast?

470
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,500
Are you
kidding?

471
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,734
We're
natural athletes.

472
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,802
We are?

473
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,303
I've got a
great idea.

474
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,304
Just a second.

475
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,672
What're you
gonna do now?

476
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,007
I'll spell "help"
in the snow.

477
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,509
The last time you
had a great idea

478
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,478
<i>i got suspended</i>
<i>for 2 semesters.</i>

479
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,763
Look at the
new competition.

480
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,865
I can't. I
just had lunch.

481
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,607
All right,
now, look.

482
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,342
If we don't
disguise our voices,

483
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,977
we'll never pull
it off, old girl.

484
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,046
Now, once more,
from the top.

485
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,215
The...

486
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,517
"the rain in spain

487
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,352
"falls mainly
in the plains."

488
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,555
Right. Now
the other.

489
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,191
"Hurricanes
hardly ever happen

490
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,860
"in hampton,
hartford or hereford."

491
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:22,961
"She's got it.

492
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,529
"By george, i
think she's got it."

493
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,797
Thank you.
Nothing.

494
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,332
Tell me, jane,
one question.

495
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,633
What's that, dear?

496
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,802
Do blondes really have more fun?

497
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,008
Tallyho, there.

498
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,510
Toodle-oo.

499
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,811
Tallyho,
there.

500
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,513
The man here
at the lodge said

501
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,715
the girl's ski class is on slope 6.

502
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,550
And since
we're girls--

503
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,751
at least we were the last time we looked.

504
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,354
We thought we might just try our hand at it.

505
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,756
We're here on a
holiday from school.

506
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,727
Just like you chaps or chicks, uh, uh, lassies?

507
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,564
I didn't know there were any
english exchange students here.

508
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,001
Oh, yes, yes,
we exchanged everything.

509
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,703
A long
time ago.

510
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,371
At least 10 minutes.

511
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,672
Shall we?

512
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,607
To the slopes.

513
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,576
Be careful.

514
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,544
What for?

515
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,578
It feels good.

516
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,788
That's right,
very good.

517
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,790
Just keep your toes
pointed like this.

518
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,192
Good, in
the snowplow.

519
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,760
Good, good,
very nice.

520
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,563
Nita,
could you come over here for a minute?

521
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,764
Oh, stay where
you are, jane.

522
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,633
I'll be right
back, just stay.

523
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,402
Hey, hey, don't leave
me like this.

524
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,605
Where's the brakes
on these darn things?

525
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,410
My, your friend's
a fast learner.

526
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,145
Look how
nicely she's doing.

527
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,780
Good show, todd!

528
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,882
Todd?

529
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,418
Todd, uh,
jane todd.

530
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,421
Todd, t-o-d-d,
one of the oldest families in england.

531
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,690
Whoo!

532
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,628
Stretcher bearers!

533
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,631
Stiff upper lip, jane!
I'm coming, old girl.

534
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,733
But you can't
ski either, nora.

535
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,102
Are you serious?
Of course i...

536
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,671
can't.

537
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,773
Nita! Nita!

538
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,677
You keep practicing, girls,
i'll be right back.

539
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,112
Oh, yeah,
yeah.

540
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,748
Jane got away.
Quick, down there.

541
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,783
Why did
she do that?

542
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,852
You tell her to get back here right now, linda.

543
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,689
I've got no time
to argue with you.

544
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,157
I'll get her.

545
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,296
Wait for me,
dearie.

546
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,216
Nora, you
can't ski.

547
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,721
Whoa!

548
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,356
Oh, craig!

549
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,757
Help!

550
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,726
Watch out!

551
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,980
And i'll never cheat
in exams again.

552
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,815
And when i grow up,

553
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,685
i promise never to make a long-distance phone call

554
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,053
and charge it to
a wrong number.

555
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,287
Whoa!

556
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,689
Whoa!

557
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,063
Of course,
keeping all these promises won't be easy.

558
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,932
But i'll try starting
with the easy ones first.

559
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,168
Like, i promise to
brush after every meal.

560
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,970
Yes, that's a
good start.

561
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,742
My lips are
getting chapped.

562
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,781
What good is a book like this without pictures?

563
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,024
All right!
All right!

564
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,327
What's your license number, buddy?

565
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,829
Hey, hey, hey!

566
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,931
What's your phone number, honey?

567
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,633
Say, how would you like a kick in the mouth?

568
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,002
Great. Play hard to get,
'cause i just love it.

569
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,003
You know
something?

570
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,138
No, what's that?

571
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,806
That was
a mistake.

572
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,809
Hey, they don't make girls like you anymore.

573
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,578
Oh, i hope not.

574
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,846
Ha.
Ha.

575
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,517
Whoa!

576
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,903
Oh, jane.

577
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,140
Must have made a wrong turn.

578
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,642
I'll break it.

579
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,644
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, yeah.

580
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,045
Come on. I
dare you to.

581
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,648
Nora!

582
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,849
For crying out
loud, linda,

583
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,384
will you clear
out of here?

584
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,887
Can't you see we
want to be alone?

585
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,655
Nora!

586
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,991
Sorry, but he tried
to get fresh with me.

587
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,893
I don't like him
at all, jane.

588
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,060
I don't
blame you.

589
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,395
Oh, nora!

590
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,898
How can you talk that way about our freddie?

591
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,934
Why, all the girls in school just love him.

592
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,437
She's right, you know,
every one of them.

593
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,307
Come on, baby.
I'll walk you back to the lodge.

594
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,011
I say there,
but you really do dig pain, don't you?

595
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,512
Oh, nora!

596
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,348
Nora, could i speak to you for a moment?

597
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,650
Privately?

598
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,118
Of course,
my dear.

599
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,254
Toodle-oo.

600
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,658
Oh, hey,
are all you english girls like that?

601
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,594
Oh,
only before we're married.

602
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,463
Yeah, what happens
afterward?

603
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,566
Karate.
Chop, chop!

604
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,677
Looks like i've got to teach you about men, nora.

605
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,579
Men? Ha! I know
all about men.

606
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,113
My governess
told me years ago.

607
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,715
The birds
and the bees.

608
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,383
The bees jump
on the flowers

609
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,118
and get their
feet all sticky,

610
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,587
then they go to
another flower

611
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,355
and get them
even stickier.

612
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,591
Doesn't really sound like very much fun.

613
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,759
Although, i would like to get married someday

614
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,629
if the right bee, uh,
boy should come along.

615
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,598
Well, then, uh,

616
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,934
i don't know how things are done in england,

617
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,136
but, well,
what you just did to freddie

618
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,606
is--is not the way to get and keep a man here.

619
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,075
Oh, tell me more,
linda, please.

620
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,477
All right, but raise
your right hand first.

621
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,412
Oh, this is
so exciting.

622
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,414
Now i want
you to swear,

623
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,418
"i, nora, do solemnly
swear never to reveal

624
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,221
"to any boyfriend,
fiance, husband,

625
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,123
"son or grandson
of mine,

626
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,293
"the following information which i am about to hear.

627
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,128
"So help me
liz taylor."

628
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,830
Liz...

629
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,566
i swear it.

630
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,167
All right,
first...

631
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,737
<i>in order to comply with the government's</i>

632
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,939
<i>request to keep the</i>
<i>population explosion</i>

633
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,307
<i>going at full blast,</i>

634
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,110
<i>the sound will be turned off for the next few moments.</i>

635
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,745
Do you think it
would be all right

636
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,313
if i called jane
over to listen?

637
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,081
She's a girl,
isn't she?

638
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,018
Man, if she isn't,
momsie is going to be awfully upset.

639
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,087
We've been sharing the same nylons for 3 months.

640
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,189
Well, then
she's entitled.

641
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,560
Jane.

642
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,063
Oh, i'm
coming, dear.

643
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, and, uh,
it was fun.

644
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,202
Hey, let's be
better friends.

645
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,605
If only you
meant that, freddie.

646
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,839
I do.

647
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,009
Don't hurt me.

648
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,312
I saw the way you
looked at nora.

649
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,049
Yeah, you're
very perceptive.

650
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,818
With nora, it's...

651
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,086
it's more
than friendship.

652
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,589
Sorry. Still
want to shake?

653
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,193
Oh, well, at least
you're honest.

654
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,227
Sure i do.

655
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,200
Hey, i said
i was sorry.

656
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,012
Painting the town

657
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,247

658
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:08,086

00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,089
oh, when the
sleigh ride

660
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:14,025
sure gets cold

661
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,062
when you have
no love to hold

662
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:24,068
got to find me a love
instead of hanging around

663
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:29,107
when i find me a love
i'll be painting the town

664
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,243

665
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,279
painting the town

666
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:39,650
we're gonna turn this whole town upside down

667
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,789
oh, mr. Moon's
hanging low

668
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,594
how he shines on
the new fallen snow

669
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:55,099
and that twinkle
of love in your eyes

670
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,071
makes me feel
reindeer really can fly

671
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,308
gonna try

672
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,778

673
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,080
painting the town

674
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,951
we're gonna turn this whole town upside down

675
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,426
got a feeling
i can't hide

676
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:27,265
when you're right
here by my side

677
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,134
got to live
while you can

678
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,437
instead of
hanging around

679
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,107
if you live
and you love

680
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,009
you'll be
painting the town

681
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,978
painting the town

682
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,381
painting the town

683
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:47,518
we're gonna turn this whole town upside down

684
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,323
painting the town

685
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:57,462
painting the town

686
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,181
boy, are you
unoriginal.

687
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,382
All right,
all right.

688
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,252
What do you think of, uh,
<i>finnegans wake?</i>

689
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,621
I didn't even
know he was sick.

690
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,690
That's what i
thought. Come here.

691
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,196
Now you'll have
to marry me.

692
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,998
I heard bells.
I swear it. I heard bells.

693
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,199
How do you like that?

694
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,235
It's the
sleigh, silly.

695
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,505
For a minute there,
i thought you were the avon lady.

696
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,207
I'm beginning
to like you.

697
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,243
What are you gonna
be when you grow up?

698
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,844
When i...

699
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,647
always putting
me on. All right,

700
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,649
go ahead,
if it makes you feel better.

701
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,251
Honestly...

702
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,419
do you really
like me?

703
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,687
You tell me first.

704
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,256
No, i asked
you first.

705
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,058
All right.
I'd marry you tomorrow if i could get a raise.

706
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,260
I didn't know
you had a job.

707
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,362
I don't. I meant a
raise in my allowance.

708
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,229
Oh.

709
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,430
Well,

710
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,699
it's the thought
that counts.

711
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,402
I really do like
you, barb. Very much.

712
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,038
We'll see.

713
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,607
We'll see? W-what
does that mean?

714
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,042
I don't know.

715
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,344
I saw barbara stanwyck say it in a movie once

716
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,313
and she wound up
with cary grant.

717
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,382
One favor, please.

718
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,249
Mmm.

719
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,285
Don't be
funnier than me.

720
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,086
Can i be prettier?

721
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,621
Yes, but
not funnier.

722
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,257
I wouldn't
even try.

723
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,463
Linda.

724
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,299
Linda, i want you to
be my girl. Seriously.

725
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,434
I mean, see only me
while we're up here.

726
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,470
You mean, like, um,
go steady in the snow?

727
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,772
You've got to.

728
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,310
Todd, i don't
"got to" do anything.

729
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,480
You can't tell a
girl to be your girl.

730
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,750
It has to come
from her. Slowly.

731
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,352
You're too anxious.

732
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,487
Yeah, i guess
you're right.

733
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,822
My technique's
nowhere.

734
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,124
You even said it that
night at the drive-in.

735
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,893
Just be honest.

736
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,995
Then linda, what
am i doing wrong?

737
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,763
Oh, i know,
everything.

738
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,899
You always answer
your own questions.

739
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,567
Why do you
always do that?

740
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,903
Then tell me what's the right technique, linda,

741
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,438
to get a girl
to care for you.

742
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,906
A girl like you.

743
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,576
Oh, todd,
a girl doesn't tell a boy something like that.

744
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,344
They don't?

745
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,347
No. They might
tell another girl

746
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,882
how to spot a phony
from a real guy.

747
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,785
Oh, sure. Yeah,
sure, sure.

748
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,455
Women are much too competitive to help each other.

749
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,423
Oh, no.
That's not true.

750
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,925
Why, just
this afternoon,

751
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,928
i was straightening out 2 english
girls about american boys.

752
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,329
You were?

753
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,931
Yeah, i was going
to tell them more

754
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,466
as soon as we get back to the lodge.

755
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,368
I see. Then you'll
probably give them

756
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,003
the rest of the
scoop tomorrow, huh?

757
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,871
Well, actually,
i was going to invite them

758
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,306
up to our
room for cocoa

759
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,340
after the
sleigh ride,

760
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,376
but i don't know
where they live.

761
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,378
Oh, well, uh,
if i see them,

762
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,946
i'll, uh,
i'll tell them to drop over.

763
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,515
Oh, great. They were
really lots of fun.

764
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,418
More than
craig and me?

765
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,422
In a different way.

766
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,425
Never change 'em

767
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,428
never change 'em

768
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:22,533
we'll never change 'em,
they'll always be the same

769
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,368
never change 'em

770
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:28,372
we'll never change 'em,
it's such a foolish game

771
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,907
never change 'em

772
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,643
no matter what,
what we say

773
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,579
you know they'll
always have their way

774
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,415
we'll never
change 'em

775
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,816
never change 'em

776
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,418
we'll never
change 'em

777
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,585
never change 'em

778
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,690
we'll never change 'em,
we'll never make 'em see

779
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,591
never change 'em

780
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:52,163
we'll never change 'em,
it's plain as it can be

781
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,597
never change 'em

782
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,667
we never want
to let 'em go

783
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,403
don't you know
that we love 'em so?

784
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,838
We'll never
change 'em

785
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,606
never change 'em

786
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,841
we'll never
change 'em

787
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,509
never change 'em

788
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,878
maybe we should
forget about 'em

789
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,881
maybe we should
say goodbye

790
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,385
what would we
ever do without 'em?

791
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,388
Right or wrong,
we know they're still our guys

792
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,224
right or wrong,
we know they're still our guys

793
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,228
we'll never change 'em,
we feel it deep inside

794
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,863
never change 'em

795
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:30,634
we'll never change 'em,
they've got to have their pride

796
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,469
never change 'em

797
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,538
we wouldn't try,
if we could

798
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,575
that's why we
want it understood

799
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,043
we'll never
change 'em

800
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,578
never change 'em

801
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,979
we'll never change 'em

802
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,447
never change 'em

803
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,484
maybe we should
forget about 'em

804
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,253
maybe we should
say goodbye

805
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,089
what would we
ever do without 'em?

806
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,426
Right or wrong,
we know they're still our guys

807
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,229
right or wrong,
we know they're still our guys

808
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:02,666
we'll never change 'em,
we feel it deep inside

809
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,801
never change 'em

810
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,972
we'll never change 'em,
they've got to have their pride

811
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,607
never change 'em

812
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,443
we wouldn't try,
if we could

813
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,112
that's why we
want it understood

814
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,814
we'll never
change 'em

815
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,315
never change 'em

816
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,517
we'll never
change 'em

817
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,152
never change 'em

818
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,486
we'll never
change 'em

819
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,988
never change 'em

820
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,495
where did you girls learn how to do the fish?

821
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,297
It was too much.

822
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,100
Do it again!

823
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,701
Hot cocoa,
anyone?

824
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,970
Oh, just what i need
on a cold night.

825
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,672
Me, too.
I'm freezing.

826
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,507
You look warm.

827
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,943
Sure you wouldn't be more
comfortable with that bathrobe off?

828
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,511
Yes, why don't
you take it off?

829
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,347
No! No! No, i'm just fine.
Thank you.

830
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,083
Hey, listen,
speaking of dumb boys,

831
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,554
did i tell you about the time i
taught craig gamble a lesson

832
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,789
for arriving late
on our first date?

833
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,626
No, but we're just dying to hear,
aren't we, nora?

834
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,727
Just dying.

835
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,132
Well, we were parked up on mulholland drive,
in the dark

836
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,568
and he decided
he had to kiss me.

837
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,569
What did
you say?

838
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,804
I said no, naturally.

839
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,573
Boy, that kinsey
was some liar.

840
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,541
What happened?

841
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,077
Well, first of all,
he locked all the car doors

842
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,879
and then he
tried to tie my arms

843
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,014
behind my back
with my hair ribbon.

844
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,750
So, i
fixed him.

845
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,818
I let him
kiss me.

846
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,587
That's
getting even?

847
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,022
I had a cigarette in my mouth at the time.

848
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,628
And his nose and his chin,
and his eyebrows

849
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,733
so, it turned out to be a very passionate kiss.

850
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,769
Oh, you know, boys
are all right.

851
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,572
You just have to watch them every minute.
That's all.

852
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,876
Why, just tonight,
todd tried to put his arm around me.

853
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,545
What happened?

854
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,748
Anybody want a date with a
nice-looking boy with only one arm?

855
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,587
He never tried that again.
At least, not with me.

856
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,755
Is he all right now?

857
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,791
Oh, yes,
he's coming back to school next semester

858
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,594
that is,
if his parole comes through in time.

859
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,197
Oh, well,
it's getting kind of late.

860
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,099
Nora and i had better be going.

861
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,767
Nora!

862
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,103
Tomorrow's
a big day.

863
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,638
Too-too.

864
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,739
Too-too.

865
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,374
Bye.

866
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,611
Pillow fight.

867
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,679
Free for all.

868
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,817
Shall we?

869
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,185
You had to ask.

870
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,776
Ohh! Ohh!

871
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,613
"Never have so few done so much for so many."

872
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,482
Couldn't have put it better myself,
old girl.

873
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,253
Somebody turn out the lights.

874
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,354
Beddy-bye.

875
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,091
Nighty-night,
little angels.

876
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,737
What do
we do now?

877
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,173
Craig.

878
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,810
What's the average
age of our audience?

879
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,546
15?

880
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,514
Out.

881
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,504
No, no, no,
miss sally.

882
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,373
I will not have
every room searched.

883
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,541
That is not
our policy here.

884
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,247
My dear miss
sally, please.

885
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,383
I have an entire
day's activities

886
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,984
uh, to get
started.

887
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,720
Give me a description of the missing articles

888
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:17,921
and i'll see
what i can do.

889
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,195
Look,
all i want to do is

890
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,997
learn
how to ski,

891
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,499
so i can get
out of costume

892
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,734
and spend some
time with barbara.

893
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,903
After all,
that's why we're here, isn't it?

894
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,938
Not to play
<i>some like it hot.</i>

895
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,974
Besides, this
girdle's killing me.

896
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,010
Today's the
last time.

897
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,779
As soon as we
learn how to ski.

898
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:48,952
Good morning,
mr. Pevney.

899
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,954
Oh, good morning,
girls.

900
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:56,927
Lovely day.

901
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,896
Oh, it's, oh,
it's, it's...

902
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:00,798
too-too.

903
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,266
Too-too.

904
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,070
Smoky blonde...

905
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,739
with little bangs?

906
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,813
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

907
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:16,847
Shh.

908
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,051
Take off
your wig.

909
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,386
I'll catch a cold.

910
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,954
Boy, do you have
a bad memory.

911
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,989
Operation
screwball.

912
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,258
Oh, yeah. Make
pevney crack.

913
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,761
Into 1,000
little pieces.

914
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,496
Scattered
everywhere.

915
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,799
What are
you gonna do?

916
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,934
Watch.

917
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,810
Softer, swept,

918
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,513
pageboy, in the back.

919
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,984
That--that does
sound nice.

920
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,988
I forgot
something.

921
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,828
No, no.
No, i-i...

922
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,865
look, i'm sure the wigs won't turn up in another state

923
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,967
dyed a
different color.

924
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:13,704
I know they do that
with stolen cars.

925
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,674
The hot-wig racket?

926
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,643
I see.

927
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:20,878
I've got
it now.

928
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,214
Say, would you mail
this for me, please?

929
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,920
I presume that means "yes."
Thank you.

930
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,827
I thought i was
getting better.

931
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:41,932
Come on, mitzer.

932
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,939
Come on, mitzer.

933
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:50,941
Whoa!

934
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,578
Now, come on,
girls, let's go.

935
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,214
Put your skis on.
Best of luck, then.

936
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:58,882
Come on.
Hurry, hurry.

937
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,152
You, too, jane,
you get on the skis.

938
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,888
Only this time,
you be more careful.

939
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,124
I'm always careful.

940
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,927
Oh, oh, tell
me, nita,

941
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,361
uh, uh,

942
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,364
you've been here longer than nora and i,
haven't you?

943
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,933
For 3 months.

944
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,136
Well, then, uh,
what's wrong with the american girl?

945
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,039
You know,
it's funny that you ask me that.

946
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,374
I was just going to ask you the same thing.

947
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,910
Games, games.
All they do is play games.

948
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,111
And talk.

949
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,379
Talk all
the time.

950
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,182
You know, in sweden,
it's very different.

951
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,951
In stockholm,
when the boy and girl meet

952
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,186
and they like
each other,

953
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,189
no games and
very little talk.

954
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,924
Yeah!
Yeah!

955
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,127
I dig it. He likes...
she digs, likes it.

956
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,764
"It's the only
way to fly."

957
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,100
Have you
got a friend?

958
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,368
A friend?

959
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,203
Yes, you
know, like, uh,

960
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,606
like nora and
i are friends.

961
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,942
Same town, same
place, same ideas.

962
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,979
Helga, she works
in the town.

963
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,413
Yes, helga?

964
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,617
Well, uh,
would you excuse us for a minute, dear?

965
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,985
Yeah, but you
hurry back

966
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,921
because we start the ski lesson in just 10 minutes.

967
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:12,923
Yes. Just 10 minutes.
That's it. Yeah.

968
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,993
Now, look,

969
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,228
i'm going back to the hotel to get out of this wig.

970
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,430
But the ski lessons,
i mean, barbara and linda.

971
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,965
That's the
whole point.

972
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,134
I've been thinking about the
secret of freddie's technique.

973
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,569
Now, he has lots
of girls, right?

974
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,436
Right.

975
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,804
Well, then,
don't you see?

976
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,740
Girls are only
interested in boys

977
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,975
that are interested
in other girls.

978
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,176
Oh, i see.

979
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,978
If we go with
nita and helga,

980
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,080
then barbara and linda will become--

981
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,081
absolutely.

982
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,016
Let's go.

983
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,150
Wait a second.

984
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,085
It'll look kind of funny for the both of us

985
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,820
to suddenly disappear as nora and jane

986
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,189
and, 15 minutes later,
come back as todd and craig.

987
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,792
That's no good.
I'll go, you stay here.

988
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,094
Uhh!
I get nita.

989
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,029
Helga.
Nita.

990
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,430
I said helga.

991
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,065
Come on, what
if she's a dog?

992
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,001
Nita! Nita!

993
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,037
Yeah! Yeah!

994
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,006
Tell me about your friend helga.
Is she pretty?

995
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,008
She is a lot of fun.

996
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,810
She's got a
nice personality.

997
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,178
She's a dog.

998
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,013
Well, i'll be back
in 15 minutes.

999
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,384
Listen, when i
come back as me

1000
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,720
you don't
know me.

1001
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,724
Come on, what do you
think i am? Stupid?

1002
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,863
Look, uh, have a
coke or something.

1003
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,466
Nothing's going to happen for at least 10 minutes.

1004
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,134
Hi, beautiful.

1005
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,337
I've been looking
all over for you.

1006
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,907
This just isn't
my century.

1007
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,178
Have you
been avoiding me?

1008
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,846
Like
the plague.

1009
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,048
Well, thought you might like to go for a little ride.

1010
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,616
Lots of luck!

1011
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,251
Oh, ho.

1012
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,053
Hot cocoa.
I brought it for you.

1013
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,522
Thought you looked in need of a little warming up.

1014
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:55,125
Look, go take your
hot cocoa and...

1015
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,694
oh!

1016
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,563
Oh, thanks.

1017
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,632
Ah, good, huh?

1018
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,434
Mmm. Yummy.

1019
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:08,271
You know, you're obnoxious,
but you're not dumb.

1020
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,073
You do know
something.

1021
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,842
I know how to
treat a woman.

1022
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,110
Oh?

1023
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,878
How's that?

1024
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,080
Why don't you just, uh,
climb aboard,

1025
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,349
and, uh, maybe
i'll show you.

1026
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,252
I think it would be safer for your bluecross rates

1027
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,087
if you told
me instead.

1028
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,356
Ok, it's a deal.
You first.

1029
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,290
Yeah.

1030
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,308
Are you sure you know how to work this--

1031
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,444
look. Relax, baby,
will you? Huh?

1032
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,679
It's just like
driving a car.

1033
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,083
Oh!

1034
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,119
Nora! Nora!

1035
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,091
Oh, i say, this is fun,

1036
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,793
and much safer than skiing.

1037
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,430
I guess it just
wasn't meant to be.

1038
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,399
Whee!

1039
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,333
Beep! Beep!

1040
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,288
Whee!

1041
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,167
Hi, i didn't know there
was a ski jump over here.

1042
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,202
There isn't.

1043
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,205
Oh, how wonderfully
thrilling it must be

1044
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:51,508
to go hurtling down a steep,
snow-covered ski jump

1045
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,643
and then go
flying into midair.

1046
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,446
Hundreds of
people-- freddie!

1047
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,181
Help!

1048
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,217
Freddie, help!

1049
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,023
Remember

1050
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,158
to tell

1051
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,226
doctor

1052
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,827
on next tape...

1053
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,232
i had same
dream again.

1054
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,003
The one where
my mommy...

1055
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,205
wishes i had

1056
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,041
been born a girl

1057
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,278
instead of a boy.

1058
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,883
May i have 2 airmail stamps, please?

1059
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,417
Of course
you may.

1060
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,219
Here you are.

1061
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,220
Thank you.

1062
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,827
It's happened!
Look!

1063
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,196
It's happened!
Look!

1064
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,864
Don't you see?

1065
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,233
Mama's wish
has come true.

1066
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,069
I'm a girl.

1067
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,405
I'm a--i'm
a girl!

1068
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,707
Oh, i'm a girl.

1069
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,378
Men are
such rats.

1070
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,618
Pevney.

1071
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,321
You, pevney?

1072
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,057
Why you?
What for?

1073
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,893
You, too.
You, too.

1074
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,230
Ah! You, too.

1075
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,266
It's contagious!
It's catching!

1076
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,235
That's the
last straw!

1077
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,270
That's the
last straw!

1078
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,559
Nita?

1079
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:50,260
<i>Ja?</i>

1080
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,330
Forget it.

1081
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,099
You say it stays
completely dark

1082
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,134
for 8 months of the year in stockholm?

1083
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,569
This is true.

1084
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,271
You must have
big light bills.

1085
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,340
No, no, we, uh,
try to keep the lights out

1086
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,976
in the house as much as we can during the winter.

1087
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:09,512
You mean to tell me you live
inside the dark for 8 months?

1088
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,313
<i>Ja.</i>

1089
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,649
You must bump into each other a lot.

1090
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,518
No, we do not walk around much in the winter.

1091
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,388
And, um...

1092
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,924
eat, how do
you eat?

1093
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,826
We do not eat
much, either.

1094
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,596
But, work?
I'm sure you--

1095
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,698
no, we do not
work much, either.

1096
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,535
Well, then...

1097
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,772
forget it.

1098
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,642
Pretending to be secretary of the ski club.

1099
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,478
"Golly, miss elksberg.
We just gotta have

1100
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,346
"an interview for
the school newspaper.

1101
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,383
"Otherwise, nobody will believe we were really here."

1102
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:49,052
I hate him.
He's so obvious.

1103
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:52,355
What did you ever see in him, anyway?

1104
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:55,392
I don't know,
but i do now.

1105
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:59,329
I'd like to have a picture of you for the paper.

1106
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,464
Yeah, well,
i have one in my room.

1107
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,632
I just felt
you did.

1108
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,368
You want i should bring it to you tonight at dinner?

1109
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:08,371
No, i hate to look at pictures while i eat.

1110
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,407
By the fire then,
in the lodge.

1111
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,675
You meet me
there at 9:00?

1112
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,411
Oh, yeah, that'll be great.
Just great.

1113
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:18,448
Just you and me by the roaring fire.
The 2 of us.

1114
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,625
We found him
out there.

1115
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,394
You better put
him by the fire.

1116
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,628
It's
mr. Pevney.

1117
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:06,696
Darn!

1118
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,466
We thought it was the abominable snowgirl.

1119
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,769
Hey, are you really
the ski patrol?

1120
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,472
You were expecting
maybe rock hudson?

1121
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,474
Look at
these dogs.

1122
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,477
Vodka martini.

1123
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,078
Whiskey sour.

1124
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,481
Anything
we can find.

1125
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,484
That's why we really
came. We needed refills.

1126
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,052
Have you saved
many lives lately?

1127
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,487
4.

1128
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,922
4? How
wonderful. Who?

1129
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,258
Well, first there
was barney,

1130
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,494
then 2nd,
lloyd,

1131
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,662
then me, twice.

1132
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,930
Oh, i know who
you really are.

1133
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,665
You're james brown
and the flames.

1134
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,800
I have all
your records.

1135
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,301
Shh. Don't tell
my mother.

1136
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:46,736
She still thinks
i'm in the army.

1137
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,571
You're gonna sing for us,
aren't you?

1138
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:49,572
Sure,
come on.

1139
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:50,473
Outta sight.

1140
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,543
Oh, i feel good

Yeah!

1184
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,504
Gone.

1185
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,474
Gone, lost out there,
somewhere in that wilderness.

1186
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,679
Freddie, don't worry about nora too much.
She'll be all right.

1187
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,681
She's pretty
tough, you know.

1188
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,316
Oh, i know.

1189
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,684
That's what i
love about her.

1190
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,653
I don' t know why you should be angry with me.

1191
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,856
You're right.
I don't even know you that well.

1192
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,693
Look, what you do
is your own business.

1193
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,794
What did i do?

1194
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:58,695
Nothing.

1195
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,264
Except no one,
including me,

1196
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,466
has seen you for
the past 24 hours

1197
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:07,804
and 7 people saw nora go in and
out of your room 4 times today.

1198
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:08,838
No--

1199
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,008
oh, oh, the little,
uh, english girl.

1200
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,477
She's there right now,
isn't she, in your room?

1201
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,646
And she went
in at 4:15.

1202
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,649
Look, can i help it if todd and i dig european women?

1203
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,719
And linda and i
were so nice to them.

1204
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,657
Well, what are you
so happy about?

1205
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,525
Are you kidding?
You heard barbara.

1206
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,494
I'm having a big
scene with myself.

1207
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,495
What?

1208
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,496
Never mind.

1209
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,802
You know,

1210
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:40,870
i don't know
why you 2 guys

1211
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,373
even bothered to come up here in the first place.

1212
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,742
2 days,
and neither of you has even had the guts

1213
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,743
to try on a
pair of skis.

1214
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:47,777
Gin.

1215
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,747
We were thinking of going up tomorrow, freddie.

1216
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,716
Mmm-hmm.
Well, tomorrow's the club ski-jump championship.

1217
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,019
Oh, too bad. Maybe
the day after, then.

1218
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:58,921
We're going back
the day after.

1219
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,990
Well, as the dodgers
always say,

1220
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,358
"wait till next year."

1221
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:04,927
Chicken.

1222
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,763
"Sticks and
stones will"--

1223
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,898
you could win tomorrow if you wanted to.

1224
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,700
Of course,
i could.

1225
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,068
I like
winners.

1226
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,538
He's never jumped in
his life. He's afraid to.

1227
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,939
That is true?

1228
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,574
You're afraid?

1229
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:19,942
Such a waste
of energy.

1230
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:21,944
You jump for me.

1231
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,579
But--but--but i...

1232
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,948
you win the
championship tomorrow.

1233
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,018
You want me to risk my life for a little gold cup?

1234
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,754
No, todd, you win
more than the gold cup.

1235
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:35,958
If you win tomorrow,
we play the american game.

1236
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,894
Spin the bottle.

1237
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,363
Well, what
did you expect?

1238
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,798
This is an
american picture.

1239
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,033
All right,
i'll jump.

1240
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,868
Todd!

1241
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,937
That voice sounds
vaguely familiar.

1242
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,605
I hate you.

1243
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,978
I do hope you win.

1244
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,049
Perfect
feminine logic.

1245
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,052
"I hate you. I
do hope you win."

1246
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,420
That's logical.

1247
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,825
We, who are about to watch you die,
salute you.

1248
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,831
Until tomorrow.

1249
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,579
Well, what choice
did i have?

1250
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,615
I don't know.
We could have stayed home and done pushups.

1251
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,904
Come on in.

1252
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,548
I got it.

1253
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,518
It's lucky i remembered the morning weather balloon.

1254
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,886
I never knew
helium was so heavy.

1255
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,854
Here, bring
it over here.

1256
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,856
Let's see. I
got everything?

1257
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,124
Mmm-hmm.

1258
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,860
This goes in here.

1259
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,129
Ok?

1260
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,064
Now, let's strap this on with a couple of my belts,

1261
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,332
and we'll be
ready to go.

1262
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,967
Do you think
it'll work?

1263
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:25,902
Why not? It
works in movies.

1264
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,885
<i>Now, our next</i>
<i>contestant is...</i>

1265
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,054
uh...

1266
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,092
fred car--

1267
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,196
<i>fred carter.</i>

1268
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,466
Boo! Boo!

1269
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,335
Good luck,
freddie.

1270
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,937
Luck? Who
needs it?

1271
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,755
<i>236 feet.</i>

1272
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:29,966
<i>Our next skier</i>
<i>is, uh, gene rosson.</i>

1273
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,968
Last chance,
todd.

1274
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,736
Ah, may the
best man win.

1275
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:54,957
<i>Gene rosson,</i>
<i>221 feet.</i>

1276
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,660
<i>The leader is</i>
<i>still freddie carter.</i>

1277
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,934
<i>Now, the last participant is a new jumper</i>

1278
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,103
<i>named, uh...</i>

1279
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,007
<i>todd armstrong.</i>

1280
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,237
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, now!

1281
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,010
It works!

1282
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:56,852
I wonder if
president johnson

1283
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:59,021
will talk to me
when i come down.

1284
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,892
He's still
going up.

1285
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,995
Sir isaac newton just turned over in his grave.

1286
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,031
Just a little more.

1287
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,033
Just a little more.

1288
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,502
Whoa!

1289
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,075
He's so fat. Why's
he so fat, craig?

1290
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,076
What?

1291
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:23,045
Oh, well, he, uh,
had a big breakfast.

1292
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:26,248
Todd always eats a big breakfast before jumping.

1293
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,085
Pull the
string, you nut.

1294
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,421
The wind's changing.
I'd better pull it.

1295
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,058
I can't find it.

1296
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:39,195
Oh! Oh!

1297
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,765
The string!
The string!

1298
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,702
I can't
find it!

1299
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,639
"Play spin the bottle."
I'm a very sick boy.

1300
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,375
Oh!

1301
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:54,744
What can
we do?

1302
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:57,079
Well, uh,
when he reaches the coastline,

1303
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,081
our radar will
probably pick him up.

1304
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,885
Then a couple of jets will take off and shoot him down.

1305
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,653
Shoot him down?

1306
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,672
Whoa!

1307
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,083
You think he's all right?

1308
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,153
You all right, todd?

1309
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,821
I think
it's broken.

1310
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,656
Yeah, it's
broken.

1311
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:41,924
No, my leg.

1312
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,393
Ow!

1313
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,127
It's broken,
too.

1314
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:46,896
Ow!

1315
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,399
Ow!

1316
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,134
But, doctor,
i got a date tonight!

1317
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,269
A big one.

1318
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,137
Can't you just put
a band-aid on it?

1319
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,173
I'll come back tomorrow for the splint.

1320
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,774
Oh!

1321
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,180
Oh!

1322
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,182
Todd, you've got
a broken leg.

1323
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,150
You can't go
out tonight.

1324
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:09,585
Oh, yes,
i can.

1325
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,621
Nita left me a note,
along with a map to her house. Read it.

1326
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:16,358
"Hurry. I am waiting, darling."
Signed, "nita."

1327
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,828
"P.s. bring the
milk bottle."

1328
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,930
Todd, you can't go
out with that leg.

1329
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:23,365
Craig, if i don't go,
think what it'll do

1330
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,134
to the american
image overseas.

1331
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,202
Bad, huh?

1332
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,604
The peace corps will
have been for nothing.

1333
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:31,006
Oh, and, uh,
don't wait up.

1334
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,642
And remember to call linda 10 minutes after i leave

1335
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,211
and tell her where i'm heading.
Got it?

1336
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,378
Got it.
Got it.

1337
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,252
Good luck.

1338
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:00,202
Darned if i'll be without a date our last night here.

1339
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,842
Room, uh,
211, please.

1340
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:11,180
Hello, linda?
Is barbara there?

1341
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:12,581
Yeah,
she's here.

1342
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:14,416
How's todd?

1343
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,319
In terrible
pain. Terrible.

1344
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,322
They gave him something and he
went to sleep for about a half hour.

1345
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,591
Then he woke up, got
his milk bottle and left.

1346
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,927
<i>Could i speak</i>
<i>to "you know"?</i>

1347
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,229
"You know,"
it's craig.

1348
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,864
Tell him to get lost.

1349
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,199
Barbara.

1350
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,501
All right, i'll
tell him myself.

1351
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,404
Uh, craig, she says she has a terrible headache.
She'll call you later.

1352
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,073
<i>Goodbye.</i>
I'll bet. Thanks a lot!

1353
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,335
Room 206, please.

1354
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,307
Hello, freddie?
Is that you?

1355
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,454
Ah.

1356
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,089
Let me see.

1357
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,527
"A left turn in the
fork of the road

1358
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,296
"across the field."

1359
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,564
Ah!

1360
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,800
Only about 2
more miles to go.

1361
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,109
It can't be much
further. It can't be.

1362
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:57,353
How i love
a challenge.

1363
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:50,606
Get out.

1364
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,946
Come in, darling.

1365
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:07,456
Well,

1366
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,958
i came as soon
as i could.

1367
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,232
Well. Get up.

1368
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:18,400
What for?

1369
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,570
The time
has come.

1370
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:31,980
What's
the matter?

1371
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:33,482
Nothing.

1372
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,951
Then come here.

1373
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,454
You promised to play spin the bottle with me.

1374
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,225
I don't understand.

1375
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,260
Talk to me.

1376
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,229
Talk?

1377
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,998
Yeah, like--like you do to the american girls.

1378
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,502
I've been watching, and
it looks pretty nice.

1379
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,604
Nita.

1380
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,606
Nita, don't make fun at a time like this.

1381
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,709
I'm not making fun.
I want you to talk to me

1382
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,445
and treat me like you
do the american girl.

1383
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,481
The ameri...

1384
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,916
nita, i thought that we were gonna--

1385
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,818
no, first
we talk

1386
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,487
and then candy...

1387
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,422
and then,
after that, we'll.

1388
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,257
Then more talk.

1389
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,493
Then, we can
hold hands.

1390
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,495
No.

1391
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,464
Then you ask for the
kiss on the cheek.

1392
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,101
And then, maybe,
the kiss on the cheek.

1393
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:27,703
Then...

1394
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,339
then, what
comes next?

1395
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,241
I don't know.

1396
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,942
That's as far
as i ever got.

1397
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:46,989
Hi.

1398
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,461
Now, what are you
doing dressed like that?

1399
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,695
We're pinned.

1400
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,532
Oh,
congratulations.

1401
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,767
I'm sure you and barbara will make a very--

1402
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,502
barbara?
What barbara? Freddie.

1403
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,772
Oh, come on,
knock it off. Very funny.

1404
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,675
I'm not being funny.
He gave me his fraternity pin.

1405
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,777
But he can't
do that.

1406
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,113
He's a boy and--
and so are you.

1407
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,581
We'll work
it out.

1408
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,652
You mean that.
I really...

1409
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:20,689
i'm getting you out of here, tonight.
Take this.

1410
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:27,896
Who is it?

1411
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,666
What are you doing in there, todd?

1412
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,539
I said,
what are you doing in there?

1413
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:39,541
Nora? Nora?

1414
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,909
He's so
jealous.

1415
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,881
Nora! Nora!

1416
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,649
Let's go. Out
the window.

1417
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:48,851
That freddie's
pretty hip.

1418
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:51,753
I've never been treated so nicely in my whole life.

1419
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,555
I said, out!

1420
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:56,325
I'm going to do something terrible.

1421
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,393
I mean really
terrible!

1422
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,331
Better open up, todd!

1423
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:04,600
Todd!

1424
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,336
You better
open up!

1425
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,838
Freddie thinks i should get a nose job this spring.

1426
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,274
I may give you one, tonight.
Let's go.

1427
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:14,810
Nora!

1428
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,579
You know,
he comes from a very good family.

1429
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,348
His great-great--

1430
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,616
shh! In
that window.

1431
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,286
Let's go.
Let's go.

1432
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,621
The least we can do
is leave him a note.

1433
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,123
I said,
let's go.

1434
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,625
It just
isn't fair!

1435
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,333
Nora!

1436
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:16,805
No!

1437
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,675
Nora! Nora!

1438
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,478
Taxi!

1439
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,815
Where to, buddy?

1440
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,850
Just head west.
I'll tell you where to stop.

1441
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,786
In. I said, in!

1442
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:34,656
What happens when they arrest us

1443
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,857
for not paying
our bill?

1444
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,293
We should only get that lucky.

1445
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:46,868
Hello there.

1446
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,770
Hello.
Follow that cab.

1447
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:49,805
What are you
talking about?

1448
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:50,839
Just follow
that cab!

1449
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,207
I'm a very
sick man.

1450
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,942
I don't want to have to ask you again.

1451
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:55,510
All right.
All right.

1452
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:58,880
But at least help me aim it in the right direction.

1453
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,684
That's a good boy.
Watch it, careful.

1454
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,786
We've got to catch them,
you idiot.

1455
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,688
All right.
Let me start it.

1456
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,328
Nora!

1457
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,898
Bob, wake up
everybody,

1458
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:17,966
and don't forget
the driver!

1459
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,134
What for?

1460
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,736
Never mind,
go on!

1461
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:22,904
Janet, wake up all the girls and
make sure they're dressed.

1462
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,373
Mickey, have the bus brought in front.

1463
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:25,941
Indian, we'll get
the skis and poles.

1464
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,083
Nora!

1465
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:41,289
Todd, i was kidding.
You know i was kidding.

1466
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,327
You had me scared
there for a minute.

1467
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,728
Let's go back.

1468
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,563
I'm all right,
todd. I swear it.

1469
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,165
You want me to
turn around?

1470
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,934
No, wait.
Let me see if that one light's still following.

1471
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,770
Come on, turn around.
I was kidding.

1472
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,506
You may be kidding.
But that nut on that bike isn't.

1473
01:17:57,539 --> 01:17:58,540
Keep going.

1474
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,782
Some boyfriends
we picked.

1475
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,784
Which one?
Yours or mine?

1476
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:10,786
Both of them.

1477
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,754
One runs away with
an english girl,

1478
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:15,323
and the other one
disappears completely.

1479
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,125
Well, we did
it to them.

1480
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,261
We drove
them to it.

1481
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:23,765
Every time todd put his arm
around me and tried to be nice

1482
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:25,834
i laughed
in his face.

1483
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:28,403
You must
be kidding.

1484
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:30,972
I can't believe
my ears.

1485
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,574
You can't, huh?

1486
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:34,810
What next?

1487
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:36,812
Oh, just hang
around.

1488
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,948
I don't feel like
laughing anymore.

1489
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,689
Is anybody
here?

1490
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,059
Look, they must still be sleeping.
It's only 6:30.

1491
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:28,697
Wake up!
Wake up!

1492
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,132
We need gas.

1493
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,835
Wake up,
i say!

1494
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:35,637
Oh!

1495
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,042
Who the devil
are you?

1496
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,878
We want some gas.
Would you...

1497
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,380
fill her up,
please?

1498
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:47,849
Only takes about 18 cents' worth of regular.

1499
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,953
Come on, hurry up.
We don't want her to get away.

1500
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:52,954
Yes, we do.

1501
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:54,055
No, we don't.

1502
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,423
Yes, we do.

1503
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:07,502
Come on!

1504
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:12,908
I just don't
know anymore.

1505
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,944
Why did they
run off?

1506
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:20,048
You really love
that nut, don't you?

1507
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,952
Don't you
love yours?

1508
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,255
Yeah, i
guess i do.

1509
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,092
I know what
i did wrong.

1510
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,928
But i don't know
what you did wrong.

1511
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,863
What did you
do wrong?

1512
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,199
Guilt by
association.

1513
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:41,169
Listen, have a piece of fruit.
You'll feel better.

1514
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,737
Wanna bet?

1515
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,484
Hey, look, the
pacific ocean!

1516
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,189
You mean, it
didn't move?

1517
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:03,959
Isn't anybody home
at the beach house?

1518
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,895
No, dad took mom to
vegas for the week.

1519
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,531
We'll have the whole weekend just to sit around

1520
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,933
and soak up the
sun in privacy.

1521
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,235
Great.

1522
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:17,105
If i see snow again before i'm 60,
it'll be too soon.

1523
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:26,147
Buddy, make a right turn at the brown house.

1524
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:27,983
Park in the
driveway.

1525
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:28,984
You're the boss.

1526
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,232
What should i do with these?
Burn them?

1527
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:45,734
Don't waste
a match.

1528
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:46,968
Just throw 'em
on the beach.

1529
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:49,004
When the tide
comes in, poof!

1530
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:50,472
I'll see
you inside.

1531
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,774
10 hours
when i wake up.

1532
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,009
Look, uh,

1533
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,977
use any bedroom on
the 2nd floor.

1534
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,245
I'll sleep right on the beach.

1535
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:59,047
Fine, suit
yourself.

1536
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,982
You must be pretty tired, too, huh?

1537
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,785
I'm bushed.
Could you loan me a blanket?

1538
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,754
I could sleep on
the beach myself.

1539
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,022
Sure, come on.

1540
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,658
Wait a second.

1541
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,960
I still got to figure out a way for me to pay you.

1542
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,596
How much, $560
something, right?

1543
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:15,630
Yeah.

1544
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:40,221
Look, come on,
it's the hondells.

1545
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,057
I told you,
they'd be here the beach house.

1546
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:50,999
There'll be groovy
little chicks

1547
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,067
with sweaters
real tight

1548
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,236
just skiing all day and
having parties at night

1549
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:58,807
we're gonna ride every lift,
while it's still light

1550
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,376
but we won't be
seeing the sights

1551
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:04,646
after skiing all day
and parties at night

1552
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,849
with 5 feet of snow,
what a beautiful sight

1553
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,118
there it is.

1554
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,189
And even the beginners
will be having fun

1555
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,057
why don't
you go ahead?

1556
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,859
I'll stay here
with you.

1557
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:20,061
Please?

1558
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,364
Look, don't...

1559
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,634
all right.

1560
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,344
It was late at night
when he first hit town

1561
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:39,114
his eyes were
cold and blue

1562
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:44,052
he gunned his bike once,
then he laid it down

1563
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:46,087
like he had
a job to do

1564
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:51,292
the gasser's
what they called him

1565
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:54,095
'cause he always
acted rough

1566
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:57,132
the gasser's
what they called him

1567
01:23:57,165 --> 01:24:00,168
'cause he always
acted tough

1568
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:04,105
he'd ridden all night,
all through the rain

1569
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:07,175
though no one
really knew why

1570
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:12,080
he acted real strange
and never gave his name

1571
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:14,949
for he was a real
strange guy

1572
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:19,387
the gasser's what
they called him

1573
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,990
'cause he always
acted rough

1574
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:25,126
the gasser's
what they called him

1575
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,163
'cause he always
acted tough

1576
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,470
no one knew just
where the kid went

1577
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:38,606
when the weather
broke that night

1578
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:43,144
and no one knew how
his time was spent

1579
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:46,181
if he was doing
wrong or right

1580
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:50,618
the gasser's
what they called him

1581
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:53,755
'cause he always
acted tough

1582
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,357
the gasser's
what they called him

1583
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:59,661
'cause he always
talked real rough

1584
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:45,273
hi.

1585
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,208
Todd?

1586
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:53,047
What are you
doing here?

1587
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:54,516
We followed you.

1588
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:57,218
You mean, all
the way from...

1589
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:02,657
thank you.

1590
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,292
Look, i, uh...

1591
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:08,029
i know i don't have any right to ask you this.

1592
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:09,230
But has
she gone?

1593
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,434
Nora?

1594
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:14,269
Has she?

1595
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:16,804
Oh, yeah, she's
gone. In fact,

1596
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,406
she never was.

1597
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:20,275
Oh, look,

1598
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:22,510
you don't have
to explain.

1599
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,279
I was wrong.

1600
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:25,413
Linda,

1601
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:28,116
for once, listen.

1602
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:32,086
There was no nora.
Craig was nora.

1603
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,255
Craig?

1604
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:35,557
And i was jane.

1605
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,927
Oh!
We really fooled you girls.

1606
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,428
It was one
big put-on.

1607
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:43,831
See?

1608
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:47,535
But why?

1609
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,470
It could
have worked.

1610
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,472
And then freddie
fell in love with nora,

1611
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:53,074
i mean, craig.

1612
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:55,310
And i broke
my leg

1613
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:56,811
trying to make
you jealous.

1614
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:58,313
And then nita,

1615
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,248
nita decided to become an american girl.

1616
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,986
You mean...

1617
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,356
you went to all that
trouble, just for me?

1618
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:12,427
Because you wanted
me that badly?

1619
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,529
I'm a wipeout for redheads,
you know that.

1620
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,574
Nora!

1621
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:28,309
Hey!

1622
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,320
Here, take it.

1623
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,789
Nora!

1624
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:43,124
Nora!

1625
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,126
Nora! Have
you seen nora?

1626
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,533
Have you
seen nora?

1627
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:53,501
None of you
have seen her?

1628
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:55,370
Nora? You haven't
seen her either?

1629
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:58,640
Have you seen her?
She's got hair that sort of, well...

1630
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,009
where is she?

1631
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:01,876
Who?

1632
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,344
Nora, you
idiot.

1633
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:06,114
Oh, uh, uh,
can you take it, old man?

1634
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:07,882
Hurry up and tell me before i flip out!

1635
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,183
Where is she?

1636
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:10,351
Let's have
a talk.

1637
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,320
Excuse me for
a second, honey.

1638
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,888
Just for
a second.

1639
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,356
Come on.

1640
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,160
You still haven't
told me a thing.

1641
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:20,728
Why are we
stopping here?

1642
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,665
Do these
look familiar?

1643
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:25,366
Nora!

1644
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,202
They're nora's.
Where?

1645
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:30,038
Out there
somewhere.

1646
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,973
You see,
when she heard you were coming,

1647
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,208
she started swimming in that direction.

1648
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:35,977
Right now,
i'd say she was somewhere

1649
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,645
between here
and japan.

1650
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,580
That's about as
close as i can get.

1651
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,349
Oh, no. Nora!

1652
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,185
Nora! I'm
coming, darling!

1653
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,355
Nora!

1654
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,724
Remember, float on
your back, darling,

1655
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,492
if you get tired.

1656
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,395
If you hurry,
you might catch her somewhere near guam.

1657
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:57,031
Nora, i'm coming, darling!

1658
01:28:57,565 --> 01:28:59,434
Pretty mean
thing to do, huh?

1659
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,770
Well, don't worry.
We'll tell him the truth tomorrow...

1660
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,606
if he comes back.

1661
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,408
Dear doctor lansdorf,

1662
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:10,611
i--i really feel that
i am getting better.

1663
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:16,384
Except, doctor,
there are some very strange things happening

1664
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,019
like all of a
sudden, the--

1665
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,254
the skis have
gotten much fatter.

1666
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,457
<i>The d.j.'s are saying that</i>
<i>the snow reports are good</i>

1667
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,393
<i>we'll get some alcohol</i>
<i>and put it under my hood</i>

1668
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:28,563
<i>we're being left alone,</i>
<i>like a ski party should</i>

1669
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:31,566
<i>we'd stay about a</i>
<i>month if we could</i>

1670
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:34,435
<i>after skiing all day</i>
<i>and parties at night</i>

1671
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:37,972
<i>with 5 feet of snow,</i>
<i>what a beautiful sight</i>

1672
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,942
<i>there's plenty of chicks,</i>
<i>enough for everyone</i>

1673
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:43,945
<i>and even the beginners</i>
<i>will be having fun!</i>

1674
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,301
<i>There'll be groovy</i>
<i>little chicks</i>

1675
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,903
<i>with sweaters real tight</i>

1676
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:12,473
<i>just skiing all day</i>
<i>and having parties at night</i>

1677
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:14,008
<i>we're gonna</i>
<i>ride every lift</i>

1678
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,476
<i>while it's still light</i>

1679
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,779
<i>we won't be seeing</i>
<i>the sights</i>

1680
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:20,281
<i>after skiing all day</i>

1681
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,749
<i>and parties at night</i>

1682
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:23,017
<i>with 5 feet of snow</i>

1683
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,485
<i>what a beautiful sight</i>

1684
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:27,321
<i>there's plenty of chicks,</i>
<i>enough for everyone</i>

1685
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:30,491
<i>and even the beginners</i>

1686
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,460
<i>let's have a ski party</i>

1687
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:36,731
<i>let's have a ski party</i>
