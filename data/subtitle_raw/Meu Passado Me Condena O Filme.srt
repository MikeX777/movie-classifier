1
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,169
Well intentioned. He spoke.

2
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,713
We are laughting too much!

3
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,632
We don't need dress on black tie.

4
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,968
What is this?
Why this is a problem?

5
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,723
The weeding is here, here.
Weeding is here.

6
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,808
You are lovely as a bride,
honey.

7
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,537
And you look lovely
as a waiter...

8
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,622
Look, as soon as I get to Italy,

9
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,165
I'm going to the church
of Saint Anthony

10
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,709
to fulfill my promise!

11
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,794
I finally met the
man of my life!

12
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,878
Saint Anthony, just to
let you know,

13
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,796
hat guy there is me, okay?

14
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,715
Look at the size of this line!

15
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,549
Don't you think we're
marrying too fast, do you?

16
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,259
Fast? Look at the size
of this line!

17
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,552
We've been here for six months.

18
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,553
Did you bring everything?

19
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:08,808
Let's see, ID, birth
certificate.

20
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,833
Oh, my God, this is you?

21
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,921
Your name is Fabio Clovis?

22
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,884
Your name is Mia then,
so don't push it, okay?

23
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,612
Man, you're thirty-two?

24
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,574
Hey, you told me thirty. That's
so cute, you lied about your age.

25
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,160
Stop, focus, Fabio. Focus.

26
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,661
Next...

27
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,163
And 120 reais in cash.
Youbrought it?

28
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,584
I did. And another 200 dollars
to spend on the ship

29
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,835
because I'm going to splurge

30
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,796
I'm daring, I'm going
to get the money,

31
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,339
throw it all out and
then get it back,

32
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,406
because I'm not crazy.

33
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,826
Wait, wait!
Did you bring a witness?

34
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,930
I'll give this guy
behind us thirty bucks

35
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,516
and he'll swear he knows
us since childhood.

36
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,518
Fifty!

37
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,061
Huh?

38
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,795
Next.

39
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,216
We got married, happiness, rise.
Hi, Judge, how are you?

40
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,653
The thing is, you have
to marry us quick,

41
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,655
our honeymoon will be
in Europe...

42
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,949
First time you're
going to Europe, right?

43
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,367
Yeah, how do you know?

44
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,077
Because people who've
never been to Europe

45
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,705
love telling to any stranger
that they're going go Europe.

46
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,417
Let's roll, guys...
I, Mia, accept you, Fabio,

47
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,379
in sickness and in health,
in poverty... it's important

48
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,672
for you to understand
the poverty part...

49
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,216
There's twenty bucks missing.

50
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,967
Hey, but wasn't it
120,00 reais!?

51
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,386
Mia, you told me
that it was o...

52
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,388
You've paid me,
I'm not giving it back!

53
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,932
Next!

54
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,099
Take it easy, Mr. Justice,
you're of the peace,

55
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:32,810
aren't you?

56
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,936
The name says everything.

57
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,397
Isn't there a discount
for cash payment?

58
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,857
Next!

59
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,236
I promised Saint Anthony
that I would personally,

60
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,696
thank him for the day
that I met a handsome

61
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,949
intelligent, kind,
successful man...

62
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,767
Forgive me, miss,
but where is this man?

63
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,729
Oh, you're so funny,
you're a real riot.

64
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,709
We married! Come on, husband!

65
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,586
Quickly!

66
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,711
Calm down beloved wife!

67
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,588
I'm practically carrying
all the bags!

68
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,923
All of your bags, right?

69
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,008
Man, what is all this for?

70
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,718
Look at me,
I'm the bride... one bag!

71
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,137
When it starts getting cold
and you ask to borrow a coat,

72
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,722
I'm not giving you one!

73
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,599
You know that we are going
to go through all these.

74
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,892
Different temperatures
during the crossing

75
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,269
of that endless ocean, you know?

76
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,603
Why do people throw rice, huh?

77
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,980
What a stupid tradition.

78
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,439
Not to mention
that rice is fattening.

79
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,942
You wanted them to throw
brown rice, Mia?

80
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,010
Shouldn't we catch a cab, Fabio?

81
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,721
Look at him there.

82
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,491
Hi, Mr. Péricles!
You took your time!

83
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,909
Thank God you got here!

84
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,310
Everything will
be fine. Trust me!

85
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,356
Go!

86
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,211
- Come on baby!
- Whait, Mia.

87
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,519
- Whait, hold on the ship.
- Lets go, get out here.

88
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,521
- Stop!
- To Italy!

89
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,399
Italy. Speed up!

90
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:33,111
Oh, that's lovely!
Look at the size!

91
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,767
Why doesn't it sink?

92
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,518
Put aside the passport
and the ticket.

93
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,062
We're going to Europe!

94
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,563
On a plane at least
I can at least take a pill

95
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,815
and induce a semi-vegetative
state and just wake up

96
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,359
at the destination.

97
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,361
My mother warned me that I would
get dizzy and feel sick on the ship.

98
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,196
But we haven't even
gone aboard yet!

99
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,116
I didn't know you were
so afraid of ships!

100
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,785
I'm not a man to be afraid.

101
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,893
It's dread!

102
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,789
Relax, it'll go away soon,
it's too much emotion

103
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,981
for one day, right?

104
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,431
I'm impressed!

105
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,852
Have you ever felt this
sometime in your life?

106
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,004
There was this time that
I helped my father

107
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,314
to carry a sack of cement for
construction at the house.

108
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,315
It was very similar.

109
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,610
Take a deep breath,
feel the salty sea smell,

110
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,404
let's embrace this ocean.

111
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,406
I can't take a deep breath now,
because there is something

112
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,740
crushing my lungs.

113
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,033
Things are kind of heavy for me.

114
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,077
And to embrace he sea,
I have to drop you to the floor,

115
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,037
so you choose.

116
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,287
Let's turn around, love!

117
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:40,747
What?

118
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,498
Wheel around, like in those
romantic movies you know?

119
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,750
The couple kisses
and twirls around and around.

120
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,003
Loved the idea.
But how about this that

121
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,546
romantic movies have too;
Let's go to our room,

122
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,547
get naked and have sex?

123
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,090
I love that about romantic
movies.

124
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,824
Okay, let's go to the room then.

125
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,451
Hey, hey, hey!

126
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,553
In your arms.

127
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,304
Or it'll be bad luck.

128
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,680
Oh, so this that I'm trying
to do is luck for you?

129
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,913
Good of you to tell me.

130
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,899
My love I want to enjoy
every second with you!

131
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,011
I can't wait to get to
Our master suite plus.

132
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,789
Our room, pleased to meet you,
Mia, room? The best cost benefit.

133
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,332
Cost benefit in this
case is like

134
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,792
"you pay cheaper and gets
a real bargain staying

135
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,335
in a room that looks
really cheap!”

136
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,546
Mia, many things in
the room cause anguish,

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,798
you want to do a lot
of things and stuff

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,133
when actually the
point is to what?

139
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,344
To have sex and spoon

140
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,346
I doubt that a balcony
with a view

141
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,681
to the ocean
can make you anguished.

142
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,099
I'm going to tell you that
this view is making me feel

143
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,226
very anguished... come here,
because you can fall out.

144
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,936
Be very still...

145
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,229
Hey, Mia, what can I do?

146
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,274
It's the room.

147
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,860
Look, the room is simple,
but our trip

148
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,094
will be incredible.

149
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,698
Just let me make a call...

150
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,722
Yeah, me too.

151
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,618
Hey, Mommy, how's everything?

152
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,828
Hi, Pri, how are things
At the newsroom?

153
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,957
You're going to love Mia!
Italy, yeah!

154
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,250
In installments!

155
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,836
Okay. But what about the
story On renegade Brazilian

156
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,837
exports in Asia?

157
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,631
Say it again, boldus tea

158
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,466
and lemon balm tea.

159
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,385
But if I can mix
Paracetamol with

160
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,137
acetylsalicylic acid
and clonazepam,

161
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,722
do you think there'll be
some bad side effects?

162
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,140
Okay, when I get
back from the honeymoon,

163
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,975
we can have a meeting
with the team.

164
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,852
No, Grandma,
I haven't had a fever yet.

165
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,104
Let's hope.

166
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,271
Hi, Aunt Santinha!

167
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,399
If you need anything,
try my personal email, okay?

168
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,402
I ate it, yes, I did I made it,

169
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,887
I made that yogurt
loosens everything,

170
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,535
Mom, I have to hang up
because something is going on.

171
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,688
I'll call you back, Mom.
If I survive.

172
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,190
Okay, big
kiss. What is happening?

173
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,001
Attention,
attention all passengers

174
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,665
are called to perform
the emergency drill.

175
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:57,133
Dress your jacket life preserver
and go to metting place.

176
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,135
It hasn't even left
and it's already sinking?

177
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,512
- What is going on?
- Calm down, calm down.

178
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,097
It's a routine procedure, love.

179
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,181
Is it routine to sink?

180
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:04,766
What is this?

181
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,684
Come to the middle of the bed,

182
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,768
we have to keep to the middle.

183
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,253
What is going on,
for the love of God?

184
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,231
I don't understand why
we're wearing a life vest!

185
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,456
When I travel by plane I
don't have to wear a parachute.

186
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,318
Fabio, can you stay close to me, please.

187
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,262
If I hold you, both will be falling.
I'm sic.

188
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,598
Lady and gentleman,
welcome on board.

189
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,933
In case you listen the
emergency alarm,

190
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,453
Is ♪ short beeps after one long beep.

191
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,605
You have to dress the savety jackets.

192
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,332
And go to metting point.

193
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,585
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure! Why not?

194
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,170
Is there a boat for everyone or

195
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,588
just for the rich,
like on the Titanic?

196
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,612
Fabio...

197
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,741
Hey, guys, it wasn't a joke,
it was a sincere question.

198
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,507
Hmm, this food is wonderful.

199
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,277
Excellent whistle.

200
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,155
Love, are you afraid
of sinking from your chair?

201
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,281
Take that off, please.

202
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,741
Just let me keep it
on today until I get used to

203
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,201
this idea of being on
the high seas.

204
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,744
It makes me feel so safe.

205
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,746
Look around you,
everyone is happy,

206
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,521
excited, taking pictures.

207
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,625
Hmm, look.

208
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,084
Could there someone
famous out there?

209
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,087
Oh, I think this is so chic.

210
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,839
Every chic place has a
tragic event happen there.

211
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,216
And if there is
someone famous here

212
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,425
then it's even worse.

213
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,093
Because the newspapers
are only going to

214
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,970
talk about the celebrity and
I'll be buried as an indigent!

215
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,013
Hi, how are you?

216
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,306
Thank you very much.

217
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,266
You can leave the bottle
on the table, please.

218
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,393
Wait. It's all
included in the package?

219
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,646
Oh, then you can take
it away! Thank you.

220
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,855
Come back only with water.

221
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,000
Be back only with wather.
Please, drink only a little.

222
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,292
Stop!

223
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,503
You gave me something to me, right.

224
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,587
Stop!

225
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,843
Stop! Look at! What?

226
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,475
We get food at this time.

227
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,733
You are so lovely, you know?

228
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,836
Let's take off this life vest?

229
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,713
No!

230
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,612
Haven't you heard
about safe sex?

231
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,720
What is it? Are you crazy?

232
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,490
Cruise minibars are even
even more expensive

233
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,326
than hotel minibars, Mia.

234
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,745
You're an economist
and should know that.

235
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,121
Okay, so I die of thirst,
is that it?

236
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,081
What do you want? Water?

237
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,107
I brought water, so we
wouldn't have to spend money.

238
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,753
Hey, the room is occupied.

239
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,754
Who are you?

240
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,880
Good morning, darlings.

241
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,090
I am Suzana, cabin chief and I.

242
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,884
Oh, and also to warn you to
hurry up because your

243
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,843
time is almost over.

244
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,511
What is it?

245
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,347
The boat is sinking and
there aren't enough boats.

246
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,892
What boat, kid, you're going
to miss breakfast!

247
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,435
It's only served until
10 o'clock!

248
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,044
Man, we slept really
well, right?

249
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,773
We've already missed
a lot of things, Mia.

250
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,983
Have a look, we lost
a lecture on the importance

251
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,402
of arnica, a relaxing
walk with Uncle Ruy,

252
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,988
a Jacuzzi for pregnant women

253
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,907
Mia, we're paying we have
to enjoy everything!

254
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,992
He's just kidding.

255
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,328
Well, if you want it,
I can bring your breakfast

256
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,996
to your bed, no problems.

257
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,874
That way you can relax,
wake up on your own time,

258
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,793
acuddle a bit.

259
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:00,942
That's great!

260
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,879
God, what a mess!

261
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,590
Let me take care of that.

262
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:11,261
I'll put everything in
the closet for you.

263
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,555
The service here is
super VIP, huh?

264
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,810
Honey, for just 40 extra
dollars, I wash, iron, sex...

265
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:22,940
Look, that's one of their
tactics, I know!

266
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,173
We don't want it.

267
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,635
What's included in the package.

268
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,281
Do you want me to warn
reception that they mixed up

269
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,099
his bags with those
of a teenager?

270
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,540
Mia, this tobogan is a monster.

271
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,937
Man, this tobogan is awesome!

272
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,605
Fabio, don't you think
that now that you're

273
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,131
a married man you
should try to speak

274
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,444
less slang, read some
adult books

275
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,987
Mia, seriously, now that
you're a married woman,

276
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,866
couldn't you relax
and let your man be happy

277
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,827
with the entire range of
his tastes and hobbies?

278
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,330
You're right, I'm sorry,
I love you!

279
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,250
Wonderful little fuck
we had earlier today.

280
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,210
WONDERFUL.

281
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,420
The five minute one because
you wanted to come quickly

282
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,213
to enjoy the day?

283
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,506
My love, here the days
are wasted in dollars!

284
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,632
We have to enjoy them!

285
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,968
And all that phobia,
all that fear?

286
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,512
It was terror, we know
that, and it was replaced

287
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,556
by the fear of being here
on the ship, spending

288
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,666
a fortune and not enjoying and
not making the most of everything!

289
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,980
Excuse me, lovely couple!

290
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:50,110
My name is Wilson and
came to tell you that in a

291
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,654
few minutes we'll have
the forro class with me

292
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,282
and the lambaerética class
with Guilherme Malhagao.

293
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,576
It's not right that they're
both at the same time.

294
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,495
Because if those two
Classes are in the package,

295
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,037
the right thing would be for
me to be able to do both...

296
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,872
But you have that right!

297
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,582
You're the one who chooses!

298
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,001
Then I'll do the forré class
and you the lambaerébica!

299
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,004
That way we enjoy to the max
the advantages of the ship.

300
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,446
He's joking...

301
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:20,891
Come on, forward and backwards.

302
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,542
To one side, go...

303
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,023
You're great.

304
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,193
Now make your bodies sexy, everyone.

305
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,778
Very sexy.

306
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:40,802
That's great, now each
of you choose a partner!

307
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,946
Oh, lovely creature,
what's your name?

308
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,341
Fabio.

309
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,968
Fabio, I'm going to take
you out of solitude you'll

310
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,220
be my assistant!

311
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,597
Mia, don't drink that,
drinks are included

312
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,474
in the package, right?

313
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,058
Not at all, you have
to pay for everything.

314
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,185
I get it, your wife
likes to spend a lot?

315
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,437
Actually, I don't know, we've
only known each other a month.

316
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,480
It was a love at
first site thing.

317
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,481
I'm finding out here.

318
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,316
Really?

319
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,067
Then enjoy this moment
all you can.

320
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,485
After that it's all down hill.

321
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:18,365
First there's the "you're
the love of my life" phase,

322
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,242
then it's "come on, man,
don't talk like that to me"

323
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,703
and at the end the
"you fucking bastard,

324
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,080
"I should have never
met you" phase.

325
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,959
Just to remind you that
I'm on my honeymoon and

326
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,254
you're an employee paid
to entertain, give hope.

327
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,464
That's right, but you
can't have joy and hope

328
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,676
in the life I lead, kid,
especially with a bitch

329
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,011
for an ex-wife over there.

330
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,346
This woman invaded my room
today without even asking

331
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,015
for permission.

332
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,640
She did the same with my life.

333
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,766
Which is much worse.

334
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,394
Hey, Wilson, you could really
have a good thing here, you know?

335
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,646
All these hot chicks...

336
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,109
And you think the chicks
are the ones who hit

337
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,029
on the entertainers?

338
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,282
My turn to dance
with the big boy!

339
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,743
Of course! It's an honor!

340
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,745
What is your name, ma'am?

341
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,790
Ma'am is in heaven
just like the three

342
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,316
husbands I buried.

343
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,420
My name is Mirtes.

344
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,548
You are very elegant, Mirtes.

345
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,509
I imagine these husbands
left behind much more

346
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,327
than just good memories for you.

347
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,579
Let's dance.

348
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,917
Let's dance...
Come your face close, please!

349
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,045
That scented that you are today!

350
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,332
Let's start?

351
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,233
What's the name of
her best friend?

352
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,322
Correct. And couple 3?

353
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,802
Who is Lu?

354
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,327
What is his favorite movie?

355
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,306
Dead Poets Society.

356
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,727
My God, they're Jamaicans,
they're cold, what more

357
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,812
do you want from a movie?

358
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,962
Purple.

359
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,606
That's a color?

360
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,191
He said color.

361
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,818
Clarice Lispector.

362
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:18,819
The blogger?

363
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,320
Crotch.

364
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,762
Fabio...

365
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,825
Oh, unfortunately couple
number 3 is disqualified.

366
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,952
I can't qualify you, you
haven't made any points.

367
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,579
It's much better!

368
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,498
Because it means that
we'll get to know each other

369
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,333
much better during our life.

370
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,377
It's much better to be
surprised ten years from now,

371
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,503
like: Carolzinha, who is she?

372
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,630
Oh, your best friend...

373
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,216
Couple 1 has won.
Congratulations!

374
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,260
They won a super fanny pack.

375
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,995
Congratulations, a fanny pack!

376
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,850
And inside the fanny pack,
there is a stay at a five

377
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,500
star hotel in Italy!

378
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,648
Couldn't you even remember that
my favorite director is Truffaut?

379
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,650
Truffaut? Isn't that
a kind of chocolate?

380
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,610
Fabio, I showed you one
of his movies, remember?

381
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,429
All I remember is that when I
woke up some documentary was on TV.

382
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,532
I'm tired, Fabio.

383
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,016
You won't stop for a second.

384
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,537
You won't even stop talking!
Do me a solid.

385
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,789
You know all the old ladies
fall for me,

386
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,791
you have access to the
ballroom key

387
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:20,422
I take the old ladies there
and in half an hour of dancing,

388
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,923
I get some money from them.

389
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,885
You keep an eye out to make
sure no one comes.

390
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,429
Forget it, Wilson,
I'm not going to be a pimp

391
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,389
for my bankrupt ex-husband
who takes advantage

392
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,849
of dancing grannies.

393
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,894
We have to find another
way to make some extra money

394
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,270
and get out of here.

395
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,439
I can't stand looking
at your face every day!

396
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,965
And you think I can stand it?

397
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:46,847
Second day and they're
already at it.

398
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,328
You know what that's called?

399
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,187
Marriage.

400
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:00,879
Poor guy, he got
married too fast.

401
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,215
I think this marriage
isn't going to last,

402
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,907
it won't last even until Europe.

403
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,618
I want 50%.

404
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:08,805
You want? What?

405
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,933
Give me 50% of what
you make with the old ladies

406
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,726
that I'll help you with
the illegal ball.

407
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,087
I hate doing business with you.

408
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,859
If on the second day of
marriage you're already tired,

409
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,486
I don't know how it's going
to be when we get to Italy.

410
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,932
Let's choose together, love.

411
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,454
Gym opening.
The most modern in America.

412
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,872
Bridge ten.

413
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,998
You don't even like exercising.

414
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,626
But it could be fun,
they'll have some hotties.

415
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,211
Fabio!

416
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:44,756
I mean, some hot activities
some nice bikes...

417
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,157
Let's go? I need to
work on my glutes!

418
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:53,372
I've surfed, did rock climbing,
and participated in marathons!

419
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,104
But I had never seen sport
as an extension of my work.

420
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:05,110
Today I know that the
courage necessary to jump

421
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,237
from a mountain at a height

422
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,365
of 300 meters is the same
for new investments!

423
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,994
Without will and passion,
we wouldn't have become the

424
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,687
largest fitness enterprise
in Latin America!

425
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,774
Wonderfull!
He? He get atletic power.

426
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,669
Let's go further up ahead.

427
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,794
No, I'm fine here.

428
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,671
Don't you want to go
back to our room, love?

429
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,923
I need to take one of
your anxiety meds.

430
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,384
Suddenly I feel so
afraid of ships...

431
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,678
It's written there that the
guy's biography is for free.

432
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,787
Why not get a copy?

433
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,290
We already missed out
on the quiz prize.

434
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,393
Sailing is necessary.

435
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,962
And so is working out!
We wish you all a good trip!

436
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,679
Hello, fine? My name is Fabio,
can I have another one?

437
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,824
I'm here with my wife
over there, Mia!

438
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,933
It's our honeymoon!

439
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,937
Oh, that's your wife?

440
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,706
She is shy?

441
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,832
Not at all, she's jealous
of me, poor thing.

442
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,835
Lots of hot chicks here, right?
It's just a passing thing!

443
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,045
Can you autograph
it for me, please.

444
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:10,491
Write "For Fabio and Mia,
with love"...

445
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,429
Man, what a chic guy.

446
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,682
He completed a master's
degree In Massachussets.

447
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,685
He completed a master's
degree in sports marketing

448
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,439
management in llli-fucking-nois!

449
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,507
I'm not feeling very well!

450
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,237
Hi, how are the lovebirds?

451
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,447
Everything is fine.

452
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,075
Actually I already cleaned
up the room, you can give me

453
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,076
tip next time, okay?

454
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,578
But you just got married
and you're already so pale,

455
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:44,709
not knowing how to tell your
husband that it was a mistake?

456
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,379
That love doesn't exist and
that living with any other human

457
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,838
being is unbearable?

458
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:53,134
It's not because Wilson kicked
you to the curb that we are going

459
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,386
to be unhappy, right?

460
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,764
Honey, I don't know what that
lowly employee told you,

461
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,891
but I was the one who
let him go.

462
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,353
Take it, I just came to
give you this VIP invitation

463
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,771
for dinner tonight.

464
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,606
VIP invitation?

465
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,651
Enjoy! Considering how
cheap you are,

466
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,986
it's not always that you
have this chance, right?

467
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,613
Is it an actual invitation in
the sense that it's free

468
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,616
or one of those trap invitations
and you have to pay at the end?

469
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,785
Looks like it's an actual
invitation,

470
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,495
but we can forget about this.

471
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:28,519
Let's just stay in our room
tonight, just you and me?

472
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,881
"Fabio and Mia, who are already
on a honeymoon, I will have great

473
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,675
pleasure to receive you for
a special dinner at the

474
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,510
ship's best restaurant.

475
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,678
I'll expect you at nine.

476
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,304
"A big hug, Beto Assunc¢ao!"

477
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,305
Ah, it's from him, is it?

478
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,182
That's nice.

479
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,935
Rich people love making
friends with ordinary people.

480
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,395
It brings credibility.

481
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,563
And I have charisma right,
so I bring people together.

482
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,691
But we didn't bring clothes
for this VIP restaurant.

483
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,276
You didn't even bring
a basic blazer.

484
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,845
Basic or not basic
blazer my ass!

485
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,824
You know what, love?
I would rather we have

486
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:04,039
dinner just the two of
us something more simple.

487
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,541
Honey, you're going to have
dinner just with me for

488
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,542
the rest of your life.

489
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,546
And it's always going to be
beans rice potatoes.

490
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,966
But tonight I want to enjoy
with the love of my life a little

491
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,992
free glamour.

492
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,745
Can you do that for me?

493
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,463
Great!

494
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,383
Is that one?

495
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,136
Great!

496
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,365
Is good!

497
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,350
- And now?
- Is Ok!

498
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,394
-For what?
Good, you nor looked at!

499
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,105
Oh, Sir!

500
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,502
And now did you like this one?

501
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,128
That's great.

502
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,005
By the way, you
cancelled the dinner.

503
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,882
Now we're going to the Oscars!

504
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,492
You're not going dresses
like that, are you, Fabio?

505
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,720
You can't go to dinner
with that shirt!

506
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,223
Why not? I've had dinner
with it since I was 15

507
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,487
and I've never had any problems!

508
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,379
Let's focus here, Fabio:
This one or this one?

509
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,190
They're just the same
so it doesn't matter.

510
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,192
Of course not this one is
white and this one is eggshell.

511
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,218
Oh, I get it. Give me
the eggshell one then.

512
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,780
Oh, my God, have you seen
the price of this white shirt

513
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:19,930
trying to be eggshell?

514
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,932
Forget it, put it back.

515
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,146
Eh! Is very chic! What is this?

516
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,040
Honey, I have to tell
you something.

517
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,400
I didn't want to come to
this dinner because Beto, he...

518
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,193
Look him there,
can you talk later.

519
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,780
How are you?
This is Mia, my wife.

520
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,908
Who would have imagined!

521
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,179
This is Fabio, my husband.

522
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:47,207
I know, very nice we spoke
at the opening!

523
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,670
But let's sit down.

524
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,024
My wife should be coming soon.

525
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,235
You know how it is they
take ages to get ready.

526
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,528
I do.

527
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,529
I got ready really fast.

528
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,553
I took two seconds.

529
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:05,434
Per favore puo portare
che il vino italiano rosato?

530
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,164
You still like rosé wine, right?

531
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,856
Yes, a lot, my favorite.

532
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,231
Fabio?

533
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,236
- Could be.
- We studied together...

534
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,590
How are Dona Ruth,
Mr. Luiz Carlos!?

535
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,550
Great. My parents...

536
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,719
And your uncles, they still
have that house in Ibiuna?

537
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,721
You still like French movies?

538
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:25,996
Truffaut, right?

539
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,125
Wow, some good times
at that house!

540
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,478
Taking a bath in the
river and then a movie.

541
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,714
I used to invite my
class from college...

542
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,694
Look, make yourselves at home.

543
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:44,699
But I warn your chef, Nicola,
is offering a tasting menu...

544
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:49,704
Wow, awesome,
congratulations to Nicola!

545
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,706
Listen, don't these chic dinners always
have those bullshit shrimp dishes?

546
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,209
Where's the shrimp?

547
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,753
Fancy restaurants always
have them.

548
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,153
He's joking.

549
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,151
This is my wife,
Laura. Mia and Flavio.

550
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,236
Fabio.

551
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Hi honey.

552
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,658
Hello, good night. Good night.

553
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,433
Wow, you...

554
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,003
L... Laura?

555
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:45,760
Ih, it's Titty! Titty! Titty!

556
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,911
Come, Laura, this
kid is strange!

557
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:05,363
you seem familiar
to me, you know?

558
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,973
I have an ordinary
face, that's all.

559
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,451
I'm sorry I'm late.

560
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,787
I was on the phone
with an old patient.

561
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,455
Laura, and it's not
just because she's my wife,

562
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,582
but I'd say she's one
of the best doctors

563
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,709
in the country.

564
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,960
Don't exaggerate...

565
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,962
That's great. What's
your specialty?

566
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,215
She's a pediatrician,
but she is really in love

567
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,341
with alternative treatments.

568
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,302
Chinese, Indian medicine!
A great woman!

569
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:32,223
Stop, Beto. I really
love children and...

570
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,583
She loves studying!
Helping people!

571
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,588
Wow, pediatrician is
really cool. I love kids.

572
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,280
You really wore me down tonight!

573
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,722
Stud! Sexy! I want more!

574
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:17,167
Later, Dona Mirtes. Later.
You have to take a medicine.

575
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:25,026
Dona Mirtes wipe out
she dance very well.

576
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,028
So? How much did we make?

577
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:32,158
They came with this talk that
seniors pay half price, Wilson.

578
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,785
I got 100 dollars.

579
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,036
Fifty for me and fifty for you.

580
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,871
Old crows! And I'm sweaty all over,

581
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,165
giving my all in the
electronic meringue!

582
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,416
For nothing!

583
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,294
I make more money
cleaning toilets.

584
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:48,156
Since we split up, you've been
going down hill, honey.

585
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,450
Fuck!

586
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,262
And now in Salvador we're
going to open the first

587
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,430
six units in Bahia.

588
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,182
So you see, the company
is really growing.

589
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,642
Wow...

590
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,185
And, Mia, what do you do?

591
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,044
I'm a economics journalist...

592
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,650
Save a little is good, but you don't!

593
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,067
And how did you meet?

594
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,091
Yeah, how?

595
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,975
Let go of me so we
can sing Happy Birthday.

596
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,502
Are you nuts?
Look at what you did.

597
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,821
You got my hair all wet,
my new dress.

598
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,810
In Paris, right, love?

599
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:44,814
Hi, would you have something
that's less "sea"?

600
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,716
A cheeseburger, an omelet?

601
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,195
He's joking!

602
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,721
And Fabio? What does
we work with?

603
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,200
And speaking of work!

604
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,394
Sorry, it must be one
of my companies!

605
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,708
- Hello, mr. Rubens.
- Binho, how is everything on the ship?

606
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,627
Yes, Mr. Rubens, everything
is as expected.

607
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,589
I'm sorry to bother you,
son, but what is the costume

608
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,257
we have to send to fix?

609
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,157
Batman or Spiderman?

610
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:18,288
The orphan man's, who lost
his parent's too early.

611
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,664
What, son?

612
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,877
The one who lost his parents
in a robbery, so sad.

613
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,589
He finally get revenge and
turn out a milionnare!

614
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:28,590
We are almost close the deal.

615
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,259
We have to grow up!

616
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,428
Hello, Fabio?

617
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,263
I didn't understand anything.

618
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,392
Police captain? Judge?
Criminal lawyer?

619
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,121
I work with big events.

620
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,189
Imagine that, another
business man at the table!

621
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:50,755
Large parties, very sought after,
thematic, with great impact, crazy...

622
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,947
What kind of audience?

623
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,385
Child audience.

624
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,409
Education?

625
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,306
Yeah, you could say that.

626
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,767
His family has a child's buffet.

627
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:06,646
Oh, that's so cute.

628
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,815
Gee, I've always people who
manage to stay forever

629
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,150
in their childhood.

630
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,843
Actually, how many
memories today.

631
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,430
Laura, I forgot to tell you, but
Mia and I used to be sweethearts!

632
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,475
Really?

633
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,499
What a coincidence.

634
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,585
I am very happy to have
met you at this,

635
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,236
very important for me.

636
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,507
And for you, of course!

637
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,949
A toast to your honeymoon!

638
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,014
Dessert?

639
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:45,643
Look, I can't stay any longer.

640
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:52,858
Remember, love, that we
were going to see

641
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,469
the rerun of that Sunday show?

642
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,638
It's almost
time. So I have to go!

643
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:02,058
Success!, pediatrician,
very happy.

644
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,229
I'm taking the rose because
she loves it... You see?

645
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,799
I didn't even want to
come to this dinner!

646
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,384
But you couldn't give
lose a free meal

647
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,344
for anything in the world.

648
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,679
If you weren't so cheap,
we would have had

649
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,847
a romantic dinner just
the two of us.

650
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,349
Lying is ten times
worse than enjoying

651
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,517
toasts and VIP invitations, Mia!

652
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,227
I didn't lie.
I tried to tell you.

653
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,729
Why are you so irritated?

654
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,106
Because I'm a childish,
fearful man who never

655
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,274
left my childhood,
isn't that right?

656
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,818
Enough, this argument
makes no sense!

657
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,902
Forget it, Beto!

658
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,112
You called me Beto?

659
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,780
No, I said Fabio, Fabio.

660
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,097
I said Fabio.

661
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,160
Don't be silly, honey.

662
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,078
Beto is part of another
part of my life.

663
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,772
A time when everything
was fun, partying, adventure.

664
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,416
Really?

665
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,335
Of course! Now I want
to have kids, stay at home

666
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,045
and watch TV by your side!

667
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,947
Oh, with him its fun and with
me its washing the dishes!

668
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,427
Fabio, there is no reason for you to
idealize my relationship with Beto.

669
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,637
We had many problems.

670
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,430
Tell me one them.

671
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:04,930
And it better be good.

672
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,581
"Oh, he didn't cut
his toe nails".

673
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,725
I want something serious!

674
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,520
Okay... Well we had a
serious sexual problem.

675
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,440
Ah-ha! I knew it!

676
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,318
These guys can't get it up,
they have their blood

677
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,195
stuck in their heads.

678
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,405
It was just like that...
but it was the opposite.

679
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,367
This hyperactivity thing
was the worse.

680
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,868
Beto wanted to have sex all the
time, morning, noon and night.

681
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,394
It was a terrible problem!

682
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,081
I'm going to take a walk
and figure out what is

683
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,582
the best way to kill myself and
we'll see each other later, okay?

684
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,484
Meanwhile, you can have
your favorite rosé, okay?

685
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,703
I'm very tired!

686
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,885
What a surprise finding
your ex-girlfriend here...

687
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:06,117
So much time lost with intense, crazy,
jealous, scandalous, aggressive women.

688
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:10,770
Where were you that you
didn't show up sooner?

689
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,084
Are you sure that my meeting
my ex didn't bother you?

690
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:21,340
Of course not! You had a
love life before you met me!

691
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,759
And since I enjoyed it,
it was great, I really had fun.

692
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,969
But you're not bothered,
are you?

693
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:29,956
No, love. It's all fine.

694
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,641
Give me a whiskey, please.

695
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,621
Did someone die or your
problem is just marriage?

696
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,207
I've just found out that the
super millionaire on the ship

697
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,460
is my wife's ex-boyfriend.

698
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:01,213
And the worse thing is that
she never told me about him.

699
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:06,075
She thought you would be bothered
because you're poor or she never

700
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,012
forgot this guy and thought
you would be bothered

701
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,078
because you're poor.

702
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,056
Hum?

703
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,499
It's that the poor guy complex
is the right answer.

704
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,229
And the guy is married with the
most beautiful from my school.

705
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,508
I was crazy about her during all
my teenage years.

706
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,527
Wait a minute!

707
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,571
Your wife is much more hot because
I'm a red blooded man and

708
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:31,452
I saw her in a bikini today and
she's here with you on a honeymoon.

709
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,329
She's not with him.

710
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:37,500
You're really going to waste a
night of make up sex because

711
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,901
of some shitty millionaire with
whom she did not marry?

712
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,679
Why are we here?

713
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,056
- On the ship?
- Yeah.

714
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,724
Because we got married and...

715
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,768
And we love each other...

716
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,852
Okay, it's getting good...

717
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,688
We love each other
and I'm crazy about you...

718
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,023
It's getting better, I like it...

719
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,591
And I'm crazy for you and
I'm really getting horny

720
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,198
I love you very much!

721
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,806
I love you too!

722
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,818
Let's go, baby.

723
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,781
Fabio?

724
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,887
That tasting menu didn't
agree with me!

725
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,057
What didn't agree with you
was stuffing yourself like a refugee.

726
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,667
Go on, get dressed already,
we're already in Salvador.

727
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,090
Does the HMO helicopter
come out here?

728
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,095
Come on! My godmother is dying to
meet you, get rid of that sick face!

729
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,158
Honey, look at me,
I'm in no shape to go.

730
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:58,289
But she said she would
make a vatapa, acarajé, that

731
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,815
shrimp with garlic and
olive oil that you love.

732
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,921
Honey? You're not okay, are you?

733
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,116
You go, honey. I'll be fine.

734
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,385
Are you sure?

735
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,037
Of course, this here is
nothing! I'll be fine.

736
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,158
Hi, Beto.

737
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,016
Where are you going?
I can give you a lift.

738
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,827
Forget it, Beto, there's no
need. I'll wait for the next one.

739
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,662
Don't be silly, Mia.

740
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,687
I'm in a car,
I'm heading downtown, come on.

741
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,148
Yeah... ok.

742
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,652
Just drop me off anywhere
and I'll catch a cab.

743
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,480
Calm down, we're getting
to the infirmary!

744
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,482
You had to have taken some
medicine against seasickness,

745
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,859
this happens very frequently.

746
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,653
I not only took twenty of those pills
as I took all the other medicines

747
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,946
there are in the universe.

748
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,656
I think there is no point in going to

749
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,407
the infirmary to deliver my life

750
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,868
into the hands of some
incompetent resident,

751
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,995
I need an experienced doctor.

752
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,872
So you're going to have a witch doctor
look you over, take a bath with coarse

753
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,459
salt, a more
alternative medicine.

754
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,778
Fabio? Are you all right?

755
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,772
Oh, I miss my godchild so much,
you are the one I love the most!

756
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:54,655
Hi, godmother, let me
introduce you, this is...

757
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,741
What an elegant man
you married, my dear!

758
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,993
No, godmother, this isn't...

759
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,203
Huh? What a catch.

760
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,871
But look at this car.

761
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,709
It's like a spaceship.

762
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,544
And your mother was so worried
thinking that your husband

763
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:15,884
was just some ordinary man, but
look what a lovely man what a catch!

764
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:23,908
To protect you and protect your
love. Welcome to the family!

765
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:27,564
Gee, thanks! It's an honor!

766
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:29,064
Godmother, no, that's not it...

767
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:33,801
We have to take a picture to preserve
this lovely moment, come on.

768
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:46,439
Sorry, this is the liver.

769
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,568
I vomited so much it
ended up in my foot, right?

770
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,529
This is the heart!

771
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,801
God, my heart sometimes
beats in strange places...

772
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,286
Calm down, everything
will be fine.

773
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,015
You always wanted to be a
doctor, right? Since school

774
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,020
yeah. When I turned 18, I
went off to do some work as a

775
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,798
model abroad and I became
interested in oriental medicine.

776
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,967
You lived in Japan. Tokyo.

777
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:20,556
Exactly. Then I came back,
applied for medical school...

778
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,517
He get on federal exam
in third place.

779
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:28,272
Wow, you were guessing this as
I was placing the needles on you?

780
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:36,280
This connection with the patient is
very rare and very magical.

781
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,552
You are very sensitive, Fabio!

782
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,639
Yeah, that's how I am.

783
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:49,728
But it also helped that we studied
in the same class at school.

784
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,752
What?

785
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,024
I want you to tell me everything.

786
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,237
How was the wedding?

787
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,573
She probably was very
beautiful, right, Mr. Fabio?

788
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,117
Godmother, I want to make clear
once and for all...

789
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,744
Look when your godchild walked into
the church in the white dress and veil,

790
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,855
I started trembling, truly, I was
frozen because I was so nervous.

791
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,317
She was the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen in my life.

792
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,405
You are beatifull.

793
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:22,410
Can I do an ayurvedic massage?

794
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:30,602
Breathe and relax.
Relax everything. Relax.

795
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:34,046
I'm getting tenser.
It's pulling...

796
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,467
Relax. Release the
air in five times.

797
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,366
I think I'll relax better on my back.

798
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,893
It makes it easier for me.

799
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:53,083
You have wide shoulders, they're great
for exercising. Don't you like that?

800
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:59,423
Of course I do. I kind of let go because
I ate too much at the wedding party,

801
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,092
but tomorrow I'll be in the gym!

802
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:06,096
It's so weird that we studied at
the same school, right?

803
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,727
Funny I don't remember any
Fabio in my class.

804
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:15,254
It's okay. I wouldn't
remember me if I were you.

805
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,447
According to Ayurveda, when
any of the five elements are in

806
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,450
unbalance, a disease
process begins.

807
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,100
That is why you were sick...

808
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:34,750
Ah, sorry to bore you
with all this talk.

809
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,419
Beto is always saying this no one
is interested in this stuff.

810
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,254
No, perish the thought!
I'm loving this story of the

811
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,925
elements, earth, water, rock,
paper, scissors! Really!

812
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:47,679
You didn't have to say that to please
me, I saw you were nearly sleeping.

813
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,892
Laura, I'm sleepy
because for the first time

814
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,794
on this ship I'm feeling
100% calm and relaxed.

815
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:13,562
Oh, no, get off of me,
senior citizens!

816
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,736
Excuse!

817
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:32,782
Dona Mirtes! Were
you looking for me?

818
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:38,462
No, honey, I'm sorry, not
I only dance with Danilinho.

819
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:44,236
He is younger, dances
better and new flesh

820
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,222
is always more
interesting, isn't it?

821
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,257
Wow, do you remember that you had
to convince your father that I wasn't

822
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:08,302
going to drink and also had
to take your friends home.

823
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,304
God, my friends turned
out to be so boring.

824
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,831
And you turned out so
beautiful. What is it?

825
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,520
I feel guilty for lying for leaving
Fabio in the room

826
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,188
I loved being your
husband for a few minutes.

827
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,440
Beto, please.

828
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:25,193
I mean it. What can I
do, Mia? You move me.

829
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,821
What part of "this is my
honeymoon" you didn't understand?

830
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,033
You want me to really ignore this
crazy coincidence? And look, it's

831
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,243
obvious that Fabio
isn't the man for you!

832
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,746
You're crazy to say something like
that. You're being overbearing.

833
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,955
You don't even know Fabio!

834
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,957
But I know you very well.

835
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,584
You broke up with me because

836
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:44,379
you were a girl and I was the
older, more experienced man.

837
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,048
You couldn't handle that.

838
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:52,536
Okay. But now you're an incredible
woman, are you going to be scared?

839
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,873
Goodbye.

840
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,336
Incredible how
you still smell the same.

841
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,741
- Mia? Z?
- Hi, love!

842
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:16,578
Hi, love, how are you?

843
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,830
Wow, are you better?

844
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,832
I am... yeah (coughs) a little.

845
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:25,045
Kind of... Well, now that
you mentioned it. I'm not.

846
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:33,069
My godmother said these are to
protect you and protect our love.

847
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,556
You explained that I was sick.

848
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,850
I explained,
she understood completely.

849
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,477
I'll call her later to thank her.

850
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,938
No! There's no need. She doesn't
care about these formalities.

851
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:43,856
Of course I'm calling.
Give me her phone number.

852
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,714
- Her phone doesn't work very well.
- You sure?

853
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,859
- She lives in a distant area.
- I'll send the e-mail.

854
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,529
There is no cell phone
service or internet.

855
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,947
What a crazie!

856
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,490
I would like she love me justa little.

857
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,075
Than after, she will love me,
than we will be back!

858
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,699
- You will be there, and metting!
- I like!

859
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,870
You look so flushed, love,

860
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,788
it doesn't look like you
were in the room all day.

861
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:00,956
Yeah, well, it's

862
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,085
I think the fever is coming back!

863
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:10,489
It could be malaria, dengue
fever, stagnant water.

864
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:25,689
God, what karma. I can't get away
from this looser even in the kitchen.

865
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,190
Hey, Suzana, don't
butt into my life, okay?

866
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,151
Okay, okay. Listen, did you or
didn't you find a way for us

867
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,152
to get some money
from the passengers?

868
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,404
Mirtes isn't
yielding me any money.

869
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:37,492
I haven't thought of anything because
I was present at the birth of adultery!

870
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,662
Do you know where I left
the silly blonde kid?

871
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,663
At the SPA!

872
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:46,001
Doing what? Buddhist badinage with
that trophy wife of Beto Assuncao!

873
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:54,025
Come on, you think the
worst about everybody.

874
00:49:55,242 --> 00:50:00,039
They were there, lying down talking each
others ears off, laughing like crazy!

875
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,185
And where are the spouses?

876
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,089
On land. This isn't going to
have a good ending.

877
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,589
Wilson. I can see it!
Wait a minute...

878
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,653
If there is something that these
lazy women on cruises love is

879
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,114
a little tarot, some astrology.

880
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,699
Sounds good.

881
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:24,498
If I give you privileged
information, can I keep 50%?

882
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,624
Deal!

883
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:26,666
Then pay attention.

884
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,569
Fabio was crazy for this
Laura woman when she was a

885
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:34,466
teenager! He studied with her!
Beto Assuncao is Mia's ex.

886
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,744
They, that is, the couples are
doing the crossing.

887
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,326
Are you all right, girl?

888
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,744
Sure, why?

889
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:08,774
I think you look a little worn,
your skin a little muddled,

890
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,986
I feel some confused feelings.

891
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,466
Don't you want me to
read you the tarot cards?

892
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,926
There's no need, thanks.

893
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,680
The first one is free. Look,
I know you don't want it, but

894
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,038
I can do a quick reading,

895
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,518
I can see a situation from the
past that hasn't been put to rest,

896
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,645
but which is coming back now
with full force.

897
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:29,669
Really?

898
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,608
I see betrayal now

899
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:38,554
I see an ex-boyfriend,
a stolen hug... Death!

900
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:43,618
Take it easy, it can be the end
f the rebirth of a love affair!

901
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:50,375
That's it. Sorry, to see more, I
really have to do a proper reading.

902
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,127
How much is that?

903
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,712
200 dollars.

904
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:57,841
Hey, this gym isn't modern at all,
there are bicycles in all.

905
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:02,053
This treadmill is modern,
there's a computer.

906
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:06,498
Eh, boy... there is a computer.

907
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,502
I'm very hi. Today, very hi!

908
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,379
This boy, Great!

909
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,425
Let's go. Move on, is good?

910
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:21,406
Fabio! What a surprise finding you
here. I didn't know you jogged!

911
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,577
Oh, I love it. And today I'm really very
excited to run. I should run all day.

912
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,870
Look, if you allow
me to give you a tip.

913
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:30,040
The tip.
The tip is permited. What is a tip?

914
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:33,084
Set it to this speed here.
On this inclination here.

915
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,128
For you who is just starting,
it is important to maintain some

916
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,882
constancy, this speed is okay?

917
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,616
This is the speed at which you run?

918
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,595
No, but I've been running
for 17 years, see?

919
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,597
But I've always been very
active, I have a good structure.

920
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,683
I'm always on the run. Bam, bam,

921
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,435
running here and there.

922
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:52,145
I have a good frame, big thighs,

923
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:57,442
I run pretty good. You can
adjust it to the same as yours.

924
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:58,050
- Ok.
- 13.

925
00:52:58,217 --> 00:52:59,217
Go straited!

926
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:04,390
Everything's fine.
I'm going to market, get some DVD.

927
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,909
I went on some dancing place.
I caught a lulling.

928
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,228
I'm going to home, to put some
letters on mail box.

929
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:12,189
Good. That's good!

930
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,649
So, how are things with Mia?

931
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:16,944
That's good!
Yesterday I was talking

932
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,696
that never being so happy.

933
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,674
Fine? But a marriage
is a marriage.

934
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,825
Not even a discussion,
a drag out fight?

935
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,141
If you'll allow me a tip.

936
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:30,975
Another one!? Go on.

937
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:31,894
Wow lots of tips.

938
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:32,895
You are the tip guy.

939
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:36,690
If one day she gets angry buy
her a jewel with diamonds.

940
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,692
It can be simple, like a
pendant or a solitaire.

941
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:39,360
That's all?

942
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,944
And traveling, of course.

943
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:44,948
Bed and breakfasts from the
Charm Route, resorts yachts.

944
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:45,990
Mia is just like a child, isn't she?

945
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:46,701
She is easily distracted.

946
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:49,143
When you least expect it,
she's already forgotten the fight.

947
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:53,331
Do you have some other tip, something
under the 15 thousand dollars limit?

948
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:57,860
Of course I do, but you'll have
to find them alone.

949
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,757
Easy, easy, are you all right?

950
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:08,287
I'm fine. Has the Sao
Silvestre race started?

951
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:32,186
Look who's here. My helper.

952
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,188
What are you doing
here all alone?

953
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:40,628
Are you trying to run away from your
big spending wife? We're starting a

954
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,797
relaxing walk in a moment, coming?

955
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,760
I don't think so, right now I'm feeling
kind of shitty, I'm going to stay here.

956
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,970
It's being hard to
bear the presence

957
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,848
of my wife's big dick,
athletic, millionaire

958
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:56,728
stud ex-boyfriend, right here
in my honeymoon. It's hard.

959
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:04,319
Come on, kid. But feeling kind of
shitty is just a basic prerequisite

960
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:09,449
for being a married man. You'll
just have to learn how to live

961
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:09,992
with it. So the guy is...

962
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:15,896
Huge. It's actually a little scary.
It's immense a ship, a vessel.

963
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:21,669
And you and Mia, how are you? And
the other one, your crush from school?

964
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,672
You won't tell anyone?
Don't talk about it out loud.

965
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:30,470
Who would I tell? My only friend here is
you. I don't know anyone in this place.

966
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,539
Tell me everything,
get it all off your chest, man!

967
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,685
Let's go, guys.

968
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,126
Concentration!

969
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,255
Any news?

970
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,109
Fabio didn't tell Mia that he got
a relaxing massage at

971
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,489
the spa and by her turn, Mia
did not tell Fabio that she

972
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,366
came back from Salvador
very friendly with her ex.

973
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,284
This is going to end badly,

974
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:57,705
Suzana, because not only Beto has
a big dick but he's addicted to sex.

975
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,917
And you tell me this without
any preparation.

976
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:04,462
My God, this is wonderful.
I'm even all sweaty.

977
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:08,633
You're so shameless,
Suzana! Get away from me!

978
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,576
Go find a toilet to clean yourself.

979
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:19,835
Mia!

980
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,399
I'm just taking a walk...

981
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,651
It's lovely. Come in, there's room!

982
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,887
It's water from the Dead Sea.
They say it's good for the skin.

983
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,807
My mother always
says, the skin first.

984
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,328
You never came here?

985
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,579
No, you come here often?

986
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:41,833
Every day, get in already,
you'll feel the difference.

987
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,901
Can the Dead Sea be really here?

988
00:56:56,288 --> 00:57:00,435
I loved our dinner.
You're such a fun couple.

989
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,420
I loved the
invitation, too. Thanks.

990
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,632
Beto speaks of you
with great tenderness.

991
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,820
I'm glad that's not
an issue for you.

992
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:18,844
Of course not, we're both mature and
balanced. That's how it is for you?

993
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,833
No! Truly, Fabio was a bit
bothered when he found out

994
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,002
about Beto, because
he is crazy about me.

995
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:28,296
Really? It didn't look like it.

996
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,589
It didn't look like
he is crazy about me?

997
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,675
No! He didn't seem
to be bothered!

998
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:37,221
And yesterday, at the spa, I
also found him very sweet, calm.

999
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,140
Spa?

1000
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,308
Yeah, he wasn't feeling too
good because of his liver and

1001
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:43,085
I did some detoxifying work
with him using my hands.

1002
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,355
He didn't tell you about it?

1003
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:49,901
Oh, yeah, he did. Of
course, now I remember.

1004
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,904
Thanks! With your
hands, huh? To detoxify?

1005
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:53,864
And how is he, is he better?

1006
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:55,990
He's fine. He's really great!

1007
00:57:56,014 --> 00:58:01,037
I'm glad, Fabio is such fun.

1008
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,914
Yeah, great fun.

1009
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:07,150
You're lucky, marrying a
man with a sense of humor.

1010
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,506
All these coincidences are funny.

1011
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,675
All? There are a lot
of them? There are more?

1012
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:17,095
We used to study
at the same school,

1013
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:22,457
but I didn't realize it,
Fabio is so different.

1014
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,086
<i>And married with
my husband's ex.</i>

1015
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,189
It's a small world!

1016
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:33,969
You studied together?

1017
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:40,017
Look at this things. Excuse me!

1018
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:50,819
Only ugly women here!

1019
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,744
What is this shit?

1020
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,054
I think you owe
me an explanation!

1021
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,056
Oh, yeah? Then you owe me too!

1022
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,724
What? Have you checked the
Internet today?

1023
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:48,960
What is this I hear about
you and Laura at the spa?

1024
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:52,774
Laura is a doctor and I was feeling
very sick when you left me behind

1025
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,067
to die, remember?

1026
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,028
The ship has its own
doctors, remember?

1027
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,031
But you'd rather look up you
little friend to get a massage.

1028
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,533
Meanwhile, my wife was introducing
her husband to the family!

1029
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,744
To an aunt that didn't
even have a phone,

1030
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,621
and she now has a
Facebook account!

1031
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:07,789
The only reason why I don't go

1032
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:09,540
and bash his face in
is because... because...

1033
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,833
Because he didn't do anything.

1034
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,126
He just gave me a ride.

1035
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,547
My godmother never let me
explain. If you look carefully,

1036
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,382
you'll see I look awful in
the picture, very unhappy.

1037
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,550
You are laughing, Mia.

1038
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,285
I'm laughing because
I'm so nervous.

1039
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:29,102
My godmother is a nut job,
but I know who my husband is!

1040
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,126
And I love him!

1041
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,004
From now on we'll have a pact
to only say the truth. Deal?

1042
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,882
You have cellulite.

1043
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,236
I once faked an orgasm with you.

1044
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,071
You shore.

1045
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:40,488
You have bad breath
in the morning.

1046
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,323
You have this fold under
your arm that is kind of fat.

1047
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,574
Look at your stomach.

1048
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,039
You look beautiful when
you're angry.

1049
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,270
I get so angry that I can't
get angry at you.

1050
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,317
Attention! Lady and gentleman!

1051
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,615
Be prepair to crossing
the atlantic sea.

1052
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,123
In 3 days we will be on Marrocos.

1053
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:12,353
Honey, take it easy. We'll
arrive in Casablanca tomorrow.

1054
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,230
I'm calm, Mia.

1055
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:17,400
Calmer now because it's been
two days seven hours and five

1056
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,134
minutes since we've had a fight!

1057
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,529
Promise that nothing more
is going to get in our way?

1058
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:22,553
I promise!

1059
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,843
Couldn't you have told me
that you were going to meet

1060
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,094
this friend of yours?

1061
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:49,873
I wanted to surprise you, Mia,
you're going to love him.

1062
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,667
Titty! Fatso!

1063
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,927
Give it to me, Head!

1064
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,487
Ask me if I have candy?

1065
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,239
You have candy?

1066
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:05,931
Titty.

1067
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,161
Stop. Let me introduce
you, this is Mia,

1068
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,996
the woman of my life.
This here is Head.

1069
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,331
Hey, Mia, how's tricks?

1070
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:13,874
But tell me!

1071
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:15,917
Have you seen anyone
from the old gang?

1072
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,376
And Bolado, have you seen him?

1073
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,671
And Peida? Mario Maconha?
Rodrigueira? Big Joe?

1074
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,615
Fart, pum, fart men.

1075
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:27,244
What is this? What a Casablanca?

1076
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,998
Let's applaud the most
beautiful woman in the world.

1077
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,310
What are you doing now, Head?

1078
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,211
Currently nothing.

1079
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,190
Okay, and when you are
doing something?

1080
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:41,234
The thing is that with this
busy life as a traveler,

1081
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,694
I don't have a lot
of time to work.

1082
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,947
So I'm making due with
my unemployment checks.

1083
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:46,948
Wow cool!

1084
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,617
Cool? The unemployment
benefits are sinking Europe.

1085
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,619
No boss can compete because
the government pays.

1086
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,954
People better to
not do anything.

1087
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:57,166
Great! The dream is becoming
reality. Master, master...

1088
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,334
Hey, Fabio, you know
what I remembered now?

1089
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,778
All of us classifying women in
school by the size of their boobs.

1090
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,239
Whait... 12!

1091
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,656
Easy to win!

1092
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,426
Remember, I was the fourth!
I Was the fourth!

1093
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,246
- I won of Gabi and Paulinha.
- Paulinha, she is breast less.

1094
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,528
What is this?

1095
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,296
Take, take...

1096
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,610
Loved meeting you Head.

1097
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,888
It was great you came here
to say hello to your friend.

1098
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:12,848
Bye now.

1099
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:18,772
Fabio didn't tell you?
I'm going to travel with you guys.

1100
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:26,237
- On the ship!
- Let's go, she is very on time people.

1101
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,092
I told you he was afraid of
being alone in the cabin,

1102
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,844
he's kind of tense with
this high sea thing.

1103
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,138
But it's just for tonight.

1104
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,475
All right, you want me to sleep in
the extra bed so you can

1105
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,310
spoon with your friend Head?

1106
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,855
Come on, Mia, it wasn't on purpose
but I can't leave my friend alone.

1107
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,357
First it was just to
remember old times,

1108
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,300
then he comes to
torment us on the ship?

1109
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,404
Pretty soon I'll find out that his name
is Rubia and you have a son together.

1110
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:56,577
Look, lady, let's make one thing clear.
This kid who is before us called Fatso,

1111
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,329
had a very difficult
adolescence,

1112
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,790
many problems and who
was with him to help him?

1113
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,248
Who?

1114
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:01,833
You better believe it!

1115
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:04,776
So now you see how
he's much better?

1116
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,171
Look, Mia, pay attention!

1117
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:08,405
I won't let you take my man
away from me you hear me?

1118
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,203
Oh, My man.

1119
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,831
- His joke!
- Did you see the girl?

1120
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,374
God! Look at her face!

1121
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,877
Eh, the breast of my man.

1122
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,605
Get around!

1123
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:29,276
Whait Mia, just a joke.
She don't get you humor.

1124
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,635
<i>I-Oh,</i> Mia! Is refined!

1125
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,887
Alone at last!

1126
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,119
Listen, I had the impression that
I saw muse of your

1127
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,060
self-abuse, from fifth to eighth
grade on the ship.

1128
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:43,356
SHHHH, not so loud!
I don't want Mia to know.

1129
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,794
By the way, try to be nice.
Mia and I have just made up,

1130
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:47,629
things are much better.

1131
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:50,631
Come on, she is a wonderful
woman, a woman who is...

1132
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,299
A pain in the ass!

1133
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,553
She couldn't even receive
your best friend properly!

1134
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,679
Actually, for everything.

1135
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,539
You married and we didn't
even get drunk!

1136
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:01,892
Come with me, my man.

1137
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:07,172
Let's get drunk!

1138
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:20,703
Look, I'm sorry to intrude, but I can
see you like to know about the future.

1139
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:25,207
I work with the
future too. Tarot,

1140
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,751
divination, coffee
grinds, palm readings

1141
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:31,589
I get it, look, thanks,
I don't believe in this stuff.

1142
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,966
It's not everyone who
has this talent.

1143
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,719
I've been perfecting my
gifts for years.

1144
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:44,743
Looking at you, I see a
"woman from the past."

1145
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,398
What?

1146
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:52,717
Sir, I know women
from a distance.

1147
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,969
No way, I'm a married man.

1148
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,697
My wife can come
in at any moment.

1149
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:01,452
Ok, since you don't want
to know how your ex feels.

1150
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:06,940
No, wait!
Do I have a chance with her?

1151
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,757
You know, I'm not
feeling anything anymore?

1152
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,784
Being sensitive
requires some incentive.

1153
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,042
Excuse.

1154
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:33,550
Look, I see that you
are on the same path.

1155
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:37,821
You are going to
reach a destination

1156
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,616
and are going to
arrive at the same time.

1157
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,641
Really?

1158
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,747
For just a little more,
I can guide you better and...

1159
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,064
Shure. Right here!

1160
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,654
This is good!
Is very good. Excuse me!

1161
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:01,595
Yeah, she misses something that
is very grandiose about you.

1162
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,557
Something she doesn't have
with the current spouse.

1163
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:08,459
I can't see here is if it's
character or goodness,

1164
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:14,007
but really seems
something palpable.

1165
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,413
- Are you sure, Suzana?
- Absolutely!

1166
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,272
The tarot isn't giving
us anything.

1167
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,418
It's far from freeing us from
this enforced togetherness,

1168
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:37,047
this prison called a cruise
ship. We have to go big.

1169
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,800
You see that security guard
over there? Stall him with some

1170
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:42,344
story cause I'm going to gamble
a bit. Or do you want to go?

1171
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,265
You have more luck than me, Suzana,
you married me. I married you,

1172
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,225
I have terrible luck.

1173
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:48,833
- Get out here!
- Will be a winner..

1174
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,418
Look the man, looking us!

1175
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,981
Everything goes wrong with you!

1176
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,275
You're nothing but
a washed up old man,

1177
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,526
like that grandfather
of yours who used

1178
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,320
to extort money from
the alcoholic sister!

1179
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,030
You know I can't handle it
when you badmouth my family!

1180
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:06,994
They're better than you cousins,
those whores from Valinhos!

1181
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:12,649
The only slut cousin was yours, the
one who hung out at the overpass.

1182
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,210
The Ema who lived with the
bad bladeer.

1183
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,574
- Oh right!
- Ok!

1184
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:24,345
After discharge, the
things going to were?

1185
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,036
To the gap.

1186
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,288
Gap? Must be stunk.

1187
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,458
My God, look at your wifey...

1188
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,958
Stop! That's rightt.

1189
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,633
Look at, is everyhing that we wanted.

1190
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,553
To this very special day: To
Esteban's bachelor party!

1191
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,434
Eh, esteban, congratulations!

1192
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:58,528
Today is to extrapolate!
We lost more than one warrior.

1193
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:02,949
We lost two warriors.
Right, Anderson?

1194
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,560
Stop, stop... I'm jealous.

1195
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,980
That's why I don't want
anyone touching my man.

1196
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:20,675
But everything is included here.

1197
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,802
But I'm "The Inclusive"
Only one way.

1198
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:27,825
French kiss, French Kiss...

1199
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,201
Hey, I'm not fucking gay!

1200
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,061
What is it, bro?

1201
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,082
Is a lie!

1202
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,149
We're kidding!

1203
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:41,529
French kiss, French Kiss...

1204
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,468
Thanks.

1205
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,074
I tried...

1206
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:09,700
No.

1207
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:10,659
Listen, I just wanted...

1208
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,683
Shut up!

1209
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,419
Sorry, honey, are we late?

1210
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,754
No, not at all!

1211
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:25,674
Hey there, Mimia. Were
you waiting for us?

1212
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,634
Gee, that's so creative!

1213
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,553
Actually, no, I was waiting for
my husband for a romantic

1214
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,848
dinner for two. Oh, do you
want an extra chair for you?

1215
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:37,269
Ih, so tense.

1216
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,271
I thought you had cooled off.

1217
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,633
I'll take a walk, see you.

1218
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,615
Gee, honey you went too far.

1219
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,074
Oh, really! There is
a limit for everything.

1220
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,619
Love, enough, you can trust me.

1221
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,646
Head isn't going to
bother us, I swear.

1222
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,624
Tomorrow he's going
to his own room, okay?

1223
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,086
Take easy!

1224
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:38,479
We are getting a competition
on contest of belly!

1225
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:45,820
Falling! Get out!

1226
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,156
Get out here.
Don't scrull my jump!

1227
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,575
Hi, who are you again?

1228
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,177
I'm Head.

1229
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,556
I'm sharing a room with
Mia and Fabio, Fatso.

1230
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,934
Poor guys, come on, they're
on their honeymoon!

1231
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,896
Poor Fabio, who married
this unbearable woman.

1232
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,692
Because, I mean, come on,
she could be more easygoing.

1233
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:11,220
Hi, hi, hi, remember me?

1234
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:16,809
You're Fabio's friend, right?

1235
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,227
He's a doll!

1236
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,062
Now, is me!

1237
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,190
Judge, be prepair!

1238
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,109
Go Fabio, is you!

1239
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,367
Champ!

1240
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,248
Corageos!

1241
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,644
Fabio, I can understand why
you work with children!

1242
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,921
I have their mental age.

1243
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,549
I was going to say their purity!

1244
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,133
Yeah?

1245
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:51,843
Ok.

1246
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:02,271
Hey there, wifey!

1247
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:07,109
There's going to be a
super couples competition.

1248
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,048
Unfortunately, my husband
traded me for his asshole

1249
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:14,009
friend and the Zen ass
of his school crush.

1250
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:16,619
I'm going to give you a tip,
pay attention, dear.

1251
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,057
When a man marries a woman,
they also marry the family.

1252
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:23,185
When the woman marries the man,
she also married his friends.

1253
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,771
So there's no point
fighting against it.

1254
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,397
I would rather
have a manipulating

1255
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,566
mother-in-law that
this brainless friend...

1256
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,194
You can be sure that you'll
also have the manipulating

1257
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:36,281
mother-in-law or your husband
wouldn't act like

1258
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,658
a 14-year-old beast
in a 9-year-old body.

1259
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,285
I get it, you had sex
with my chambermaid, became

1260
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,454
confused and decided to take
it out on me, who have no

1261
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,247
participation in any of this.

1262
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:45,749
Go, leave, get out, entertainer,
because I'm trying to see dolphins

1263
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:46,857
and you're in my way!

1264
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,613
Thurday only on Costa Fabulosda.

1265
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,865
The big bale with mask.

1266
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,810
I wanted to take
the opportunity that

1267
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,979
we're alone to talk
about our relationship.

1268
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,691
Sure, honey! A very
propitious moment!

1269
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:14,844
I actually think Head is nice, and
I also want to meet Ass, Ear, Neck...

1270
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:21,368
But I think we should
do more romantic things.

1271
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:24,913
We should try a little cooler
hotel tomorrow when we get to Italy,

1272
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,250
this one with a community
bathroom that you reserved,

1273
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,545
frankly... and going back
to Brazil, I would like to

1274
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:36,824
change your TV room into a closet
because my clothes and your clothes...

1275
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:46,417
Gorgeus! What a romantic!

1276
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,587
I'm very festive..

1277
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:55,801
Honey, can you get a drink for us?
With ambrella, strawberry.

1278
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,864
- Let's talk more!
- Yes, talk about everything.

1279
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,389
I want the carpet on the room.

1280
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,100
Let's put the sofa and green cushion

1281
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,143
you are crazzy?

1282
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,188
Let's go there, come on!

1283
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,856
Yeah, Mia will take a drink to me.

1284
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,162
The best fantasy of the ship.

1285
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,813
Won the prize!

1286
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,943
Look at the commander!

1287
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,337
Where you get the fantasy
do convincent.

1288
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,489
Weren't you in that gay group
that was partying with Esteban?

1289
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,808
Looks like a washing machine.

1290
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,668
Look, we're really in shit.

1291
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:22,114
Look, Captain Giuseppe,
we really didn't get it see?

1292
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:29,103
We thought it was a costume.

1293
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,771
Eh Freitas?

1294
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:36,527
The bous had a inappropriate behavior
and need

1295
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:40,656
stay by here.

1296
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:48,622
- Have to stay here.
- Just a little.

1297
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,714
Amateur. Now learn from someone
who knows. Zorro is going to play.

1298
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,869
It's all or nothing now,
Wilson, you go take a long walk,

1299
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:11,246
take that bad luck away from me!

1300
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,899
You're completely wrong. We either
play together or we don't play.

1301
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,002
- Dona Suzana, did you understood?
- Ok!

1302
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,528
- So, you go!
- Do you believe?

1303
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,992
- I'm talking!
- 0k, nothing!

1304
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,619
<i>- But!
- Oh, god!</i>

1305
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:28,537
Lie!

1306
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,123
I told you, you bastard,
that I was lucky!

1307
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:36,587
I told you, you depraved woman,
that I'm your lucky charm!

1308
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:43,236
The man who leaves alone the most
beautiful woman on the ship

1309
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,529
has no concept of danger.

1310
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,822
You're talking about
yourself, aren't you?

1311
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:46,907
Where did you leave your wife?

1312
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:51,268
She is resting, will wake up
early tomorrow to meditate.

1313
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,064
My marriage is over, Mia.
It was already at an end.

1314
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,066
It was borring!

1315
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,859
But then I found you again.

1316
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:06,575
Look what the pirate here stole
for you at a jewelry store today.

1317
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:08,720
Are you crazy?

1318
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,205
I'm kidding. I didn't steal it.
I just bought it.

1319
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,266
Come back to me, Mia?

1320
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:18,146
You're a handsome, wealthy,
nice smelling, wealthy guy...

1321
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:18,856
Wealthy...

1322
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,273
But I love my husband.

1323
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:23,443
And where is he? Or do you think
it's right to be alone like this

1324
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,486
during your honeymoon?

1325
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,072
I don't know where that
bastard is and neither

1326
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,681
that blockhead friend of his.

1327
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,475
You know what? Let's dance!

1328
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,103
Suzana, look at this!

1329
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,582
I can't believe we won all this
money, you crazy, wonderful woman!

1330
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:42,671
We can finally leave this ship, get on
with our lives, be rid of each other.

1331
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:47,574
None of that, let's not confuse
things. I was the one who won!

1332
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,011
- You won!
- Yeah, was me!

1333
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:58,035
Suzana, don't be crazy now. The money
will be shared between both of us.

1334
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:03,108
Hmm, are you nervous now?

1335
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:06,653
You sound like your uncle Cleber,
unemployed, living off his wife.

1336
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:11,616
Don't start,
you know I can't take it!

1337
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,619
How about your mother, who never
worked, that useless ignorant woman!

1338
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,229
- Talk about her.
- She is better than

1339
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:22,109
your ignorant, classless brother
who says "nucular” and " dolphins”.

1340
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:28,866
"Pei" as peru, brother.
Came here right now, I will cath you!

1341
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:33,287
And your cousin Rose,
that pig with the nasty nails.

1342
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:39,168
Your father is a beggar.
This is a hot!

1343
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:44,256
Oh, Wilson, I'm so horny!
Take me, my stud. Come.

1344
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,740
My God, Mia has been alone all
this time... She's going to kill me!

1345
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,766
They'll not let us in
go back to the party...

1346
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:56,286
This party is included in
the package I'm paying!

1347
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,353
You can not do this!

1348
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,104
Lets's talk something!

1349
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,875
Can't be enter, is not that way.

1350
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:04,985
We talk, we just went..
I don't know.

1351
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:08,614
How are you, we can enter here?

1352
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,532
Eh, my dear, did you remember me?

1353
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,054
Soi we are free, everything is right.

1354
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:17,748
Our relationship with the
captain is like family. Huh?

1355
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,210
- He don't talk our idiom.
- Don't talk?

1356
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:29,676
His is strawed.

1357
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,054
For God, I need metting Mia.

1358
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:40,896
Stop, stop, I'm feel bad.

1359
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,482
And I'm crazy to kiss you.

1360
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:52,449
No, Beto, you're crazy?

1361
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,877
- Mia, do you traveled?
- Shut up, litte head.

1362
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,338
Fabio...

1363
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:08,631
Fabio!

1364
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:13,386
Fabio!

1365
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:15,388
Fabio!

1366
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:17,850
Mia, I forgot!

1367
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,855
- Fabio!
- Wy did you?

1368
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:25,190
You don't know what happened.

1369
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,902
Fabio, wait. Wait.

1370
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:30,320
Listen to me.

1371
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,614
Let me explain me.

1372
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:35,868
Fabio!

1373
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:37,577
Fabio!

1374
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,265
Fabio

1375
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,969
I didn't do anything,
he was the one who...

1376
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,645
Oh, sure, Beto drank alone,
danced alone, laughed alone!

1377
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,730
He is so "self-sufficiently"
badass, isn't he?

1378
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,525
You disappeared from the party,
left me alone once more to party

1379
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:51,152
with you little friend,

1380
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:53,653
as though you were a
reckless single teenager!

1381
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,489
I am a woman! Treat
me like a woman!

1382
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:58,241
Take it easy, Mia. It's over!

1383
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:03,621
You can go back to your
millionaire perfect lover boyfriend.

1384
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,166
Go back to your "approved" Beto.

1385
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,774
You ruined everything!

1386
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:14,114
Great! Because you were the one
who ruined this honeymoon!

1387
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,801
Go on, you can go back to admiring
you Zen little high school friend

1388
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,660
with the perfect ass!

1389
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:26,436
I didn't break up with you because
I was a silly and insecure girl!

1390
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,563
But because you think
you own the world,

1391
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,607
the guy who can have
everything he wants!

1392
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,525
But you're just an arrogant prick who
only knows how to talk about himself!

1393
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,570
You see! But that's why I love you!
You tell me the truth!

1394
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,347
And the truth is that I
want nothing to do with you!

1395
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,536
Because I was betrayed
by my wife during my own

1396
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,022
honeymoon, get it?
Mia is her name.

1397
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:33,878
Tis woman is a slut. SLU...

1398
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,405
Right. Yeah. She's a slut.

1399
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:43,078
She kissed another man,
during our honey fucking moon.

1400
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:01,430
I'm the cuckold of the world!

1401
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:09,855
Look, Wilson.

1402
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:10,916
Isn't that Fabio?

1403
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,024
- Eh, folks!
- Look at!

1404
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:13,817
Stoked! Poor!

1405
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,779
We caused this, Wilson.

1406
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:22,719
We were so bitter and wanted to
destroy other people's love...

1407
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,262
We who, Suzana?

1408
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,890
You were the one who read that
Taiwan tarot cards to those poor guys

1409
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,726
and ruined everyone's marriage.

1410
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,937
And all for what?
A thousand dollars?

1411
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,464
What do you mean a thousand?

1412
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:40,069
You only paid me 100!
Weren't we splitting it 50/50?

1413
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,405
I can't believe it.

1414
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:47,577
Can you focus on the problem
here: We need to help this boy!

1415
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:48,703
You owe me 400 dollars.

1416
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:55,150
Pipe down... Come on... Fabio

1417
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:05,202
Laura, I need to
tell you something.

1418
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:07,995
Sure, love!

1419
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:16,338
Mia... she... moves me...

1420
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,485
That's normal, she's your ex!

1421
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:23,404
Listen: I think I still like her.

1422
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:26,032
That's normal. Liking
is a good feeling...

1423
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:30,828
Enough! Can you tell the
truth for once in your life?

1424
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:38,711
You're a selfish, individualistic,
sexist bastard, but I enjoy the life

1425
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:44,008
you afford me and I think you enjoy
making me into your happy, stupid wife.

1426
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:47,119
They say those are the
marriages that really last!

1427
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:49,306
Wow!

1428
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:53,726
If you'd let me speak more, you'd
remember that I can be smart as well.

1429
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:59,482
And there's more: You'll
never be naive, fun,

1430
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,509
tender and candid like Fabio!

1431
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,197
I think he and Mia
deserve each other.

1432
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,182
And I think we deserve
each other as well...

1433
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:19,650
Can you forgive me?

1434
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:26,217
Try to cheer up, Fatso,
pretty soon we’ll be in Italy,

1435
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:30,054
full of women...

1436
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,705
No joke, Head, leave me alone.

1437
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:37,688
I need to talk with you.

1438
01:27:37,712 --> 01:27:39,355
Are you crazy, man?

1439
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:41,149
Don't you have any shame?

1440
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:44,068
You come here with that
bastard millionaire face

1441
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,945
I want to hear
what he has to say.

1442
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:47,780
Did you come to show your
compassion with the cuckold?

1443
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,700
Did you come to give me
shopping tips to improve my mood?

1444
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,785
Did you come to offer me a
VIP dinner, but it's not quite

1445
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,287
a tasting menu you're
hungry for, is it?

1446
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:58,374
Look, Fabio, I really did want Mia
back, I kept after her, declared

1447
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:01,544
myself to her...
but she loves you.

1448
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:07,532
Oh, all right, Beto, bla bla bla. Mia
fucked up and now she sent you here...

1449
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,431
See? Could you react to that?

1450
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,640
No, right?

1451
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:15,850
That is what I did to Mia.

1452
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:19,687
And she didn't feel a thing because
she loves your silly adolescent,

1453
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:23,048
stupid, clueless, upbeat way!

1454
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:30,222
Fuck, millionaires
are all bisexual!

1455
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,477
Mia!

1456
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:16,767
Hi, Laura...

1457
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:20,665
My, I've never seen a
man so sad to see me.

1458
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:21,958
I'm sorry, I just thought that

1459
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:25,527
I came to say
good-bye to you, Titty.

1460
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,946
You remembered me?

1461
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:30,842
I did! But I had
to make an effort!

1462
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:38,866
You became an
interesting, sexy man,

1463
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:42,419
almost unlike that
boy at school.

1464
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:43,855
Almost?

1465
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,189
Almost because

1466
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,900
you managed to keep the spark
in your eyes from that boy.

1467
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:51,177
Few guys manager that.

1468
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,307
You're the best catch
on this ship, Fabio.

1469
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,101
You can have any woman you want.

1470
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,591
Fabio, look at this.

1471
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,654
Fabio, what are you doing?!

1472
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,197
Me? Nothing much, just
some calculations.

1473
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,741
Calculations?

1474
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,619
Yeah. Come with me. This
ship is 60 meters tall, right?

1475
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:40,912
I think it's 63.

1476
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,664
Perfect. I weigh 80 kilos.

1477
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:46,292
That means that with the
impact on the water... force

1478
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:54,316
equals mass over distance, 80 divided
by 63... you can do some good damage.

1479
01:30:54,616 --> 01:31:00,222
Come on son, are you going to
kill yourself because of a woman?

1480
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,058
Actually, it's not even worth
living because of a woman

1481
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,083
imagine killing yourself.

1482
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:07,647
There's no other way.
How can I trust Mia again?

1483
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:11,025
Honey, you don't have a choice.

1484
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,444
You have to place
emotion above reason.

1485
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,404
Love above the facts.

1486
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:17,740
Feelings above intelligence.

1487
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:23,496
Love demands a certain stupidity
honey, but one thing I can tell you:

1488
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,832
It's better to have a woman
who makes you suffer once in

1489
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:28,960
a while than an ex-wife that
makes you suffer every

1490
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:34,173
single day. If you need it,
you can count on us!

1491
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:36,616
Is this? Not be that way.

1492
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:39,011
Suzana, is bad we metting
Mia by here?

1493
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,763
We have to find out this girl!

1494
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:41,764
Wy is your fault?

1495
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:42,765
Oh, shut up! It is your fault.

1496
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:43,790
It is your.

1497
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,008
Seen questa donna?

1498
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,552
You know dove is la donna?

1499
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:20,785
Hai visto questa donna?

1500
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:25,874
This is my wife. Dark skin,
kind of thin, you haven't?

1501
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:30,146
So, the boy let her go away
alone can you believe it?

1502
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:34,483
No, wait, nobody told her to
kiss the other guy, Suzana!

1503
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,318
Wilson, do you want to go against
me in front of the Europeans, do you?

1504
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:37,783
If you're angry,
that's your problem!

1505
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:43,243
She is happy...

1506
01:32:43,267 --> 01:32:44,976
No no.

1507
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:48,188
- Mia! Mia!
- Folks, look at here!

1508
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:50,899
Mia!

1509
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:57,363
Mia, is brasilian,
she is losting by here.

1510
01:32:58,031 --> 01:32:59,031
Do you know?

1511
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:03,578
- Yes!
- Where, on TV?

1512
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,413
- This woman?
- Yes.

1513
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:07,582
No. No in TV.

1514
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:12,419
Prego, no.

1515
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,591
We have to separate.
Each one go mto one place.

1516
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:17,467
I'm go to find out Mia.

1517
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:19,135
- Let's go!
- Let's go to here.

1518
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:20,844
Whait!

1519
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:30,896
Mia!

1520
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:35,419
Excuse me, did you see a girl...

1521
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:36,820
No, I didn't see.

1522
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:42,826
- Marry me, I love you.
- No!

1523
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:01,969
And...

1524
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:04,448
Nothing.

1525
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,492
The city is small but
it's not a neighborhood.

1526
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:11,437
Let's stop a moment, Titty,
pretty soon will distribute more.

1527
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,106
Fabio? Whait!

1528
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:25,242
She is there!

1529
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:27,704
Where are you going, you nut?

1530
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:32,167
- Let's go fastly.
- Fabio!

1531
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:34,169
Wait me!

1532
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:51,436
Saint Anthony, how are you?
I'm Fabio, husband of Mia.

1533
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:58,484
She disappeared and
I need to bring her back.

1534
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:06,409
I swear I'll never leave her
alone because of any friend,

1535
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:18,254
I'll never say "cost-benefit"...

1536
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:22,568
Mia!? I had this hope that you
would still have some reason

1537
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:23,903
to thank Saint Anthony!

1538
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:28,991
Thank? I came to demand why the
man of my life had to be precisely

1539
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:34,205
an idiot, clueless, ham fisted,
irresponsible and even so...

1540
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,164
You love me!

1541
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:36,188
I do!

1542
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:43,464
Will you marry me, Mia? Now,
with no hurry, no idealizations,

1543
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:44,614
and forever?

1544
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:52,431
Mia, do you accept his young
man without a cent in his

1545
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:56,000
pocket, who is afraid of being
away from his mother and

1546
01:35:56,042 --> 01:36:01,315
hasn't learned how to dress
as a man till this day?

1547
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:03,049
I do!

1548
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:10,574
Fabio, do you take this hard
ass, spoiled, complaining,

1549
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:15,561
compulsive consumer, pseudo
intellectual like your wife?

1550
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:17,312
I do!

1551
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:21,794
Then I declare you two fools
are going to be tied

1552
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:25,697
together in a boring marriage
for the rest of your lives

1553
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:30,785
while I'm going go continue having
sex with woman all over Europe.

1554
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:35,665
Sorry. You can kiss the bride!

1555
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,394
Never more I will be
gone from your life.

1556
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:57,687
For God, don't do that.

1557
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:01,125
Because I'm taking clonazepam,
and I'm almost a zumbi.

1558
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,127
- What about our honey moon?
- What about?

1559
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:04,569
We get a married again.

1560
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,070
We will talk about, later.

1561
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:15,163
Now I will tell you.
Beto is a bad Kisser.

1562
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:16,039
How?

1563
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,308
The Cabecga, is better kisser.

1564
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:18,517
Did you kissed the Cabeca?

1565
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:21,085
Was not as kiss, was only a stamp.

1566
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:24,881
- Who wells did you kissed on this ship?
- I kissed you, Mia..

1567
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,716
And 3 older on first class,

1568
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:28,301
and suddenly had kissed

1569
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:29,778
may be a money that we can pay some

1570
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:31,488
better hotel than the
hostel that will be stay.

1571
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,724
- Hostel?
- I'm joking

1572
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:36,035
we will stay on any hostel?

1573
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:37,536
Can you imagine, if I will put my
love on the hostel?

1574
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,395
- Idiot!
- We are going to stay on Maneba house.

1575
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,397
Friend's mine living in Otaly.
You will love him.

1576
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,543
Mia, came back, here.

1577
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,779

1578
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,531
