00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,850
-The SWORD region is divided into 5 major groups-

4
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,850
-A casino is planned to be built in the area-

5
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,450
-Nameless Street-

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,260
Let me go!

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,980
Let go! let go!

8
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,210
It's alright now.

9
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,330
Hey, hurry up! go!

10
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,730
- Watch out!
- Its the Rude Boys

11
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,980
How are the children?

12
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,840
They're fine

13
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,140
Who are those guys?

14
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,680
I don't know

15
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,250
Everything's a success

16
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,440
Yes, but...

17
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,780
given the Casino development plan...

18
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,250
We still don't know what will happen in the future.

19
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,280
Oya High School

20
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,850
Every single day...

21
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,220
Why do we always fight?

22
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,160
The gang from outside keeps attacking us,
so we don't have a choice other than fighting them.

23
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,160
Let's try to stop it.

24
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,550
- Let's go!
- Alright!

25
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,260
everyone let's go

26
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,500
Lately a lot of strange people come.

27
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,970
Let's party

28
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,130
What's this place? its always empty

29
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,250
It became quiet, because of the casino development plan.

30
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,770
Bad things always happen in remote places.

31
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,050
Come on' attack!

32
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,560
Hope you bastards don't regret this.

33
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,300
In this region...

34
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,860
There are five major groups.

35
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,420
Do you want to die?

36
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,430
For what reason are we using our fists?

37
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,350
We can not lose.

38
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,270
-HOODLUM SQUAD: Sannoh Rengokai-

39
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,840
We give confidence to women...

40
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,220
and guide them in their lives.

41
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
We...

42
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,340
must protect women.

43
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,020
Heidi, Marco, Lassie, Cosette.

44
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Actually, those names...

45
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,090
shut up!

46
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,250
I think they are all just high school students.

47
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,080
-White Rascals-

48
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,440
Let's go bastards!

49
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,180
The most beautiful scenery ...

50
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,800
could only be seen with your friends.

51
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
-Oya High-

52
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,720
We are a family

53
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,330
In order to survive

54
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,600
we fly higher than the rest

55
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,250
Jump!

56
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,340
-Rude Boys-

57
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,850
How can the SWORD have fun without Daruma?

58
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,190
Are you the gatekeeper?

59
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,120
Let's go, baby

60
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,720
-Daruma Ikka-

61
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,510
Taking the first letter from each group

62
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,180
The area is named "SWORD".

63
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,860
Please destroy the SWORD.

64
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,050
Destroy them

65
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,060
Are you ready everybody?

66
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,570
Chanson and Lee from the foreign mafia

67
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,180
Tried to take over SWORD.
In order to drive everyone away.

68
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,530
These areas previously controlled by ...

69
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,500
the Mugen in which their leader...

70
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,470
Kohaku was a part of.

71
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,260
Music and fashion saved us.

72
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,760
We're gonna create our own place to change our lives.

73
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
right?

74
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,710
-Mighty Warriors-

75
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,690
A scout group that will do anything for money.

76
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,950
-Doubt-

77
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,620
Those two groups teamed up
and had a fierce battle in the coastal region.

78
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,880
However, with the five SWORD groups united.

79
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,990
And their concern for their friend, Kohaku's condition.

80
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,750
The plan to take over SWORD failed.

81
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,960
Kohaku finally went back to his old self

82
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,160
Who killed my brother?

83
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,370
The one who killed Kohaku's friend, Tatsuya

84
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,360
and tries to take over SWORD region ...

85
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,210
is the Kuryu Group.

86
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,380
On the other hand, Mugen's rival, the Amamiya Brothers.

87
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,980
While looking for their brother Takeru

88
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,150
who was in Little Asia.

89
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,860
Takeru discovered that their parents' deaths were caused by Kuryu.

90
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,230
Thus, he sneaked into the group.

91
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,530
If the contents of the USB is leaked to the public, everything will end.

92
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,160
He decided to steal the USB that contains files about the casino development plan.

93
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,360
And expose it to the public.

94
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,840
However, Takeru was killed by Kuryu.

95
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,180
The Amamiya Brothers tried to fight.

96
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,980
Upon the death of their brother, they decided to give the USB to...

97
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,780
For the sake of his beloved friends,

98
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,160
For the sake of a loved one,

99
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,900
and to protect their hometown ...

100
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
In the SWORD region...

101
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,570
a fight to obtain the USB.

102
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,570
Started immediately.

103
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,810
Where is Smoky?

104
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,480
We are here for him.

105
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,390
Is that poor guy dead?

106
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,330
Stop it.

107
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,810
What do you want to talk about, Cobra-chan?

108
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,600
After the fight at the coastal area,

109
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,550
I realized that our enemy are Kuryu and Chanson.

110
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,790
Do you want to fight the Kuryu?

111
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,430
No

112
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,210
Kuryu will soon be destroyed.

113
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,880
I gathered all of you here.

114
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
To discuss what will happen in the future.

115
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,290
If Kuryu disappears.

116
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,080
The Chanson and other mafias will target the city.

117
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,360
For that, I have an idea.

118
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,490
I want to make an agreement within SWORD.

119
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,940
Agreement within SWORD?

120
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,570
Wait a minute!

121
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,450
What do you mean by, Kuryu will be destroyed?

122
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,290
Do you know what happened with the Amamiya brothers in Little Asia?

123
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,290
Yes

124
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,370
Are you serious?

125
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,100
Yes, we have to work together from now on.

126
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,270
are you kidding

127
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,590
This is not the time for the SWORD to fight.

128
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,350
Do you want a fight?

129
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,650
Hah? By the way, who are you?

130
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
We fought together...

131
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,040
ah never mind

132
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,130
Nobody recognized you after you had a haircut.

133
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,780
I know, but women don't like men with dreadlocks.

134
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,450
There's not a trace of your old self now.

135
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,470
Obviously, as explained by the Sannoh Rengokai.

136
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,980
Have you lost some members?

137
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,240
You're right, the four shadow members of their group are not here.

138
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,080
Rocky have kicked them.

139
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,080
They wanted to form a band.

140
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,550
Although they can't play musical instruments.

141
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,550
You shouldn't just kick them out because they formed a band?

142
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,240
In your area,

143
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,240
how is the struggle for land?

144
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,370
Kuryu has taken over several shops in our neighborhood.

145
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,940
Tetsu's bathhouse has also moved to the Rasen area, right?

146
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,940
Ah, yes... yes

147
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,710
I understand.

148
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,130
But that has nothing to do with us.

149
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,250
We only need to protect women.

150
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,590
I don't need any help from you...

151
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,300
..at all

152
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,090
I think this idea is good.

153
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,180
You want to have an agreement...

154
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,160
let us see the USB, then we can trust you

155
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,170
We wouldn't believe everything just by hearing about it.

156
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,500
We need to discuss it with Smoky in order to decide

157
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,980
Compared to the agreement,
we still have a lot more important things to do.

158
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,780
Let's go.

159
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,470
Okay

160
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,180
Our union before isn't a start of friendship.

161
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,370
Cobra-chan

162
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,000
Like Hyuga-chan,

163
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,150
We can't start an agreement easily.

164
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,940
But...

165
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,350
I will give you a chance.

166
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,860
This is over.

167
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,040
Rocky, why did you reject it?

168
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,730
-Prison Gang-

169
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,330
-DOUBT Founder: Ranmaru Hayashi-

170
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,610
Why is the atmosphere like this?

171
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,900
Shut up! ugly!

172
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,630
You cut your hair?

173
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,900
it's none of your business

174
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,360
Why did Rocky reject it?

175
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,080
He hates being grouped together.

176
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,000
He even kicked out his friends.

177
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,630
I don't know what he's thinking.

178
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,870
Although, we don't know his personal affairs.

179
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,100
I can't believe he kicked his friends out.

180
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,700
I don't think it's easy.

181
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,860
Looks like Hyuga also doesn't believe what we said about the USB.

182
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,170
We can't do anything for now.

183
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,630
But if the contents of the USB is exposed to the public ...

184
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,320
This is the Casino project is being carried out by Kuryu.

185
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,140
On the list of people involved, there are names of politicians and police officers.

186
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,020
In fact, there are also lists of illegal donations and account books.

187
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,350
If this is leaked to the public.

188
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,460
This country ...

189
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,510
Will be in chaos.

190
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,730
Kuryu will be destroyed

191
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,450
and the casino development plan will be stopped.

192
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,300
Then, Hyuga will understand it.

193
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,480
We only need to wait for Kohaku-san to expose it.

194
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,910
No matter what happens. We can't change anything.

195
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,090
These things are needed to be done in order to protect this city.

196
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,400
Where are you going?

197
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,690
I'm going to see Rocky.

198
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,960
If Kohaku-san leaks the contents of the USB ...

199
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,440
then that means we defeat the Kuryu, right?

200
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,070
Of course.

201
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,130
Then, what will happen to the casino development plan?

202
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,690
Perhaps the casino will be built somewhere else.

203
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,000
As expected, the bath house will be demolished?

204
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,280
If we can defeat Kuryu, our bath house will be better.

205
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,520
I don't know if there is anything I can do.

206
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,540
Tetsu

207
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,070
To be honest,

208
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,890
I thought with the redevelopment of the area.

209
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,640
Bath houses can continue to operate.

210
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,890
So dad was delighted.

211
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,010
It was difficult.

212
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,820
I know we have to defeat Kuryu I also understand what you say.

213
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,980
There is no point worrying about them.

214
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,780
Let's talk with Cobra.

215
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,530
No, but ...

216
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,090
That is what friends are for!

217
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:49,820
Yes

218
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,000
The casino will generate more than ¥2 Trillion.

219
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,420
Other candidates are upset.

220
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,440
Have the candidate site been decided?

221
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,330
No, Kurosaki,

222
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,480
Our plan to redevelop SWORD remains unchanged.

223
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,210
I heard there was a conflict before,
that there was a riot in the coastal area

224
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,030
There's nothing to worry about.

225
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,780
I tried hard to restore security.

226
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,700
If that's the case,

227
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,130
We can work with the police,

228
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,560
that is the duty of the police.

229
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,000
what do you mean?

230
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,520
He works independently.

231
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,810
Maybe I should introduce you.

232
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:01,040
My name is Saigo. I'm looking forward to working with you.

233
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,760
We also have subordinates who are just starting.

234
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,490
Genji.

235
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,420
-Kurosaki's subordinate: Genji Kuki-

236
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,990
Honestly, when will they be satisfied?

237
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,640
I'm so sick of hearing about that USB.

238
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,620
He said that it was related to Kuryu.

239
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,850
Well, what do we do next?

240
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,810
Where do you want to go the most?

241
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,140
What do you want?

242
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,800
My brother...

243
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,160
my brother is dead.

244
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,290
From now on,

245
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,940
we will end everything with the Kamizono Group.

246
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,650
This is a memento from my brother.

247
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,460
Use it to destroy Kuryu.

248
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,640
Why me?

249
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,230
We've known each other ever since you're in Mugen.

250
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,420
If you don't hear from me.

251
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,300
You can expose it.

252
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,960
What would you do with it?

253
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,040
Will you fight Kuryu again?

254
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,430
If you want something to change,

255
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,050
you have to do it yourself.

256
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,770
Lately I remember ...

257
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
what Tatsuya said about me.

258
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,260
That I'm afraid to change.

259
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,060
I don't want to make that mistake again.

260
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,170
Where is everyone?

261
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,290
At least he should have left a contact info,

262
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,000
You did enough.

263
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,460
Saigo.

264
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:37,840
Little Asia has always been under Kuryu's surveillance.
It's not under anyone's authority.

265
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,460
Even if you commit a crime, it will not be recorded,
because of having extraterritorial rights.

266
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,280
We will help you.

267
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,090
Who are you?

268
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,760
You have the USB right?

269
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

270
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,390
It's a USB that is owned by your brother right?

271
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,180
brother!

272
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,100
The USB was stolen and your brother died in vain, right?

273
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,130
Hiroto!

274
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,080
Let's go!

275
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,080
Don't talk to Kuryu's dog.

276
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:09,970
Hey,

277
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,840
Kikuchi-kun

278
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,000
If you need something, contact me.

279
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,730
We don't need your help.

280
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,460
I understand.

281
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,590
We're meeting the Amamiya brothers.

282
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,210
Kohaku.

283
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,810
It's Kuryu.

284
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,410
Tsukomo!

285
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,240
Let's go

286
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,640
Hey, hey! What happened?

287
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,980
Are you ok? Can you stand up?

288
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,190
Okay, 1, 2 ..

289
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,520
You're fine, right?

290
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,720
You guys fought hard

291
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,780
Are you okay? Can you stand up?

292
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,290
I understand, I get it ...

293
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,150
If you sleep here you'll get sick.

294
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,520
You're fine

295
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,920
it's ok, it's ok

296
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,550
Where does it hurt?

297
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,550
Which one is injured?

298
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,630
It's okay tell me, are you alright?

299
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,680
What are you an amateur!?

300
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,910
Stop playing games!

301
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,000
You're all going to die!

302
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,860
He doesn't intend to meet you.

303
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,780
Leave!

304
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,730
Thanks for everything.

305
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,560
Thanks

306
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,700
No matter how many times you come, it's useless.

307
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,500
Ranmaru is free.

308
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,160
Ranmaru.

309
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,260
That's our problem.

310
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,880
We don't want to receive help from others through this agreement.

311
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,210
Do you understand?

312
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,550
What kind of person is Ranmaru?

313
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,770
When we emerged as the White Rascals,

314
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,980
there was a conflict with Doubt.

315
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,620
Ranmaru does unacceptable things.

316
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,980
Not only his friends, even civilians are sacrificed.

317
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,630
Many women are trapped in the dark.

318
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,760
He easily crossed the line that everyone was afraid to pass.

319
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,840
He obliterates everything in the street just for fun.

320
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,960
That's who Ranmaru is

321
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,600
Ranmaru.

322
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,150
Because of his cruelty,

323
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,600
even the police could not control him.

324
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,200
Because of that incident, the station was closed.

325
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,180
Since then, the boundaries must be strictly obeyed.

326
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,300
If he returns, the same thing will happen again.

327
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,160
To protect women,

328
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,370
we can't let it happen again.

329
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,210
Hey,

330
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,850
Can't we resign from the USB thing?

331
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:46,510
what?

332
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,460
Are you saying that let's just forget about it?

333
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,720
No, that's not what I mean.

334
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,480
It's not such a bad thing if the Casino is built.

335
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,840
I meant to Tetsu and even the Big Chicken restaurant.

336
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,700
In addition, many people can benefit from the redevelopment.

337
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,330
But knowing that Kuryu is there, it couldn't be better.

338
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,970
This is a good thing if they can make the city survive.

339
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,450
Tetsu.

340
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,520
Although it's currently difficult,

341
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,340
We must look forward to the future.

342
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,010
The USB is a golden opportunity to destroy Kuryu.

343
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,170
If we miss it, there might be no other chance.

344
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,850
Even without the redevelopment ...

345
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,480
We will not have a future.

346
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,000
You saw the contents of the USB?

347
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,960
That is not something we can keep up with.

348
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,400
I also can't forgive Kuryu.

349
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,040
But I don't want to see my allies sacrificing their lives.

350
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,810
Cobra, you feel the same way right?

351
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,150
We are trying to protect this city.

352
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,580
But now we have to fight Kuryu.

353
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,680
Not only the Iemura Group.

354
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,520
It's Kuryu!

355
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,010
This time,

356
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,770
they're not opponents that we can defeat.

357
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,780
Tatsumi Iemura
- Kuryu Group -

358
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,290
Tatsuhito Ryu
- Kuryu Group -

359
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,080
Tatsuo Fujimori
- Kuryu Group -

360
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,590
Ryuhei Ueno
- Kuryu Group -

361
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,010
Yoshitatsu Zenshin
- Kuryu Group -

362
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,430
Ryukai Minamoto
- Kuryu Group -

363
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,070
Kimitatsu Kurosaki
- Kuryu Group -

364
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,530
Ryuichiro Katsunari
- Kuryu Group -

365
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,640
Ryushin Kuze
- Kuryu Group -

366
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,520
let's start

367
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,810
I don't know...

368
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,270
Why they didn't expose us.

369
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,320
We need to find the USB quickly.

370
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,750
That is important.

371
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,760
We have been looking for it.

372
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,910
The boy named Kohaku from Mugen had it.

373
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,340
Is that true, Kurosaki?

374
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,050
You already know where it is.

375
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,450
Why don't you take it back?

376
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:33,010
what? are you getting old?

377
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,750
In this case, should we start moving?

378
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,880
Good heavens

379
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,630
Do you badly want to be replaced?

380
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,120
You did well.

381
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,910
I want to play with you again.

382
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,840
There he is.

383
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,040
We finally found you.

384
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,740
So you were here

385
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,760
I'm so hungry ... let's go home.

386
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,250
Indeed there's a nice view here.

387
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,640
When I come here, I could see the future of this place ...

388
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,250
I thought I could see more of it.

389
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:01,290
I understand what Dan and Tetsu said.

390
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,090
It's difficult.

391
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,300
But,

392
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,250
if Kuryu gets involved in this city.

393
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,850
There will be no future.

394
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,950
Although I can't boast about the way I live,

395
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,840
but this city is already like a way of life.

396
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,010
If it's stolen from our hearts,

397
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,020
I don't see the reason in living.

398
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,850
In the end, we can only..

399
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,440
protect our friends.

400
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:41,840
Yes

401
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,920
Let's not commit a mistake.

402
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,730
-Sun Kings Prison-

403
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,750
Oy, Jesse! someone is looking for you!

404
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,000
I don't want to go out just like that.

405
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,530
Hey, did you hear me?

406
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,260
Okay, let's do it.

407
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,930
Smokey

408
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,010
Are you alright?

409
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,840
I'm fine.

410
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,970
I'm giving you this.

411
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,270
Is that ok?

412
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,890
It's important for you, right?

413
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,730
That's why I'm giving it to him.

414
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,040
I'm fine.

415
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,460
This is something you have to take care of.

416
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:06,940
Eri?

417
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,130
Give me a break!

418
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,290
Hey, what are you doing in front of all these guests?

419
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,230
Who gave you permission to open a gambling place here?

420
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,910
Do you have a problem with that?

421
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,440
Hey!

422
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,580
Wait a sec!

423
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,960
I don't need anything from a small fish like you.

424
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,320
Where is Hyuga?

425
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,000
Hey!

426
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,220
Hey wait.

427
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,800
Seeing you makes me nostalgic.

428
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,500
Prison, huh?

429
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,280
You were finally released from Rasen.

430
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,790
Hyuga.

431
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,260
Aren't you going to fight Kuryu after you got released?

432
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,500
My father who lost to Mugen, was cut off from Kuryu.

433
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,720
To defeat Kuryu, we must take over SWORD.

434
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,250
You're weak.

435
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,860
Are you really Hyuga?

436
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,690
I'm not saying I won't fight.

437
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,630
Come with me.

438
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,990
what?

439
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,440
You can start from the bottom and work your way.

440
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,100
But first, you need entertainment.

441
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,280
White Rascals?

442
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,810
Excuse me.

443
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,850
Someone from Doubt...

444
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280
Jesse, you're back!

445
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280
Little Asia

446
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:15,290
Don't call the others, this is an odd job.

447
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,700
You're finally here.

448
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,140
You trash.

449
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,780
Let's run, Kuma!

450
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:33,940
Stop!

451
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,290
Kaito-san

452
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,940
Indefinitely...

453
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:02,900
Hey

454
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,600
Who are you?

455
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,200
Are you Rocky?

456
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,060
So what if I am?

457
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,900
Hey

458
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,120
Hey

459
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,950
Attention! Attention!

460
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,500
This is a memento.

461
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,000
What? Who are you?

462
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,250
Pho

463
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,450
Long time no see

464
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,930
Sorry for the trouble.

465
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,300
Ranmaru, do you know him?

466
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,300
He's a comrade from Rasen.

467
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,600
There are two prisons in the SWORD.

468
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,670
Even if you are behind the fence, you're still in SWORD.

469
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,500
There is an organization called Prison Gang.

470
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,900
Inside, the strongest group...

471
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,500
consists of these people.

472
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,750
Hurry up and give us a job.

473
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,980
Children are waiting.

474
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,420
Hey, Ranmaru.

475
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,750
Can we trust these people?

476
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,700
I don't know.

477
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,800
They look like the Mighty Warriors.

478
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,200
Do you want to play a little?

479
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,430
Listen

480
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,400
First, everyone takes one coin and goes down.

481
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,140
That is interesting.

482
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,580
Yo! let's party

483
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,480
What should we do?

484
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,620
Get the money.

485
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,700
Have fun.

486
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,990
You too.

487
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,500
It doesn't matter how you do it.

488
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,750
After collecting five coins, go up here.

489
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,700
That's easy, right?

490
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,230
Game start

491
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,080
Money and power are everything.

492
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,500
As expected.

493
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,100
Now that was fun!

494
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,150
move

495
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,700
We don't need weak people in Doubt.

496
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,500
Looking forward to working with you.

497
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,500
These people will do anything for money.

498
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,860
Really a great part time job.

499
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,950
Are you released from Sun Kings?

500
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,300
I got some details from Pho

501
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,320
You're the one who attacked Rocky, right?

502
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,330
So that was Rocky.

503
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,170
No wonder

504
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,900
There are rumors that some of the SWORD has been destroyed.

505
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,900
They can't be destroyed easily.

506
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,800
So that's why you called us.

507
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,340
Right?

508
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,700
Give us an explanation.

509
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,610
There are too many new faces.

510
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,050
Our boss

511
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,620
I'm Jesse.

512
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,860
Nice to meet you.

513
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,400
This person is crazy.

514
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,790
He even moved from Rasen to Sun Kings.

515
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,670
I didn't expect you to join.

516
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,310
Let's thank God.

517
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,000
Ranmaru brings all these crazy people.

518
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,460
Rocky was beaten to a pulp.

519
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,100
I want to know who did it.

520
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,000
I want to know if he's okay

521
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,410
Hah?

522
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,170
Are you serious?

523
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,780
Are you worried about Rocky?

524
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,150
No, idiot!

525
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm talking about Tetsu.

526
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,020
Oh, I see.

527
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,400
If Tatsuya is here, I wonder what he'll say.

528
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,900
He might talk about destroying Kuryu or saving your friends.

529
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,470
As a matter of fact,

530
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,500
I can't forgive Kuryu.

531
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,810
Also

532
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,550
I don't want to leave this restaurant that my brother has protected.

533
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,020
We have a lot of memories with Tatsuya here.

534
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,600
There is no place like Itokan.

535
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,300
I wanted to create a place where you can always come back.

536
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,300
A place where we can always come back ....

537
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,000
But I understand Tetsu's feelings.

538
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,160
He wants to do everything he can to help.

539
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know what else to do.

540
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,920
That guy...

541
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,290
I can't believe he just went abroad like that.

542
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,950
You trusted that kind of person.

543
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,540
Don't say that.

544
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,300
Hey, when will he arrive?

545
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:18,200
Is he really the most trusted person you know?

546
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,180
Trust your brother!

547
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,910
Look, he's here.

548
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,860
why are you not exposing the contents of the USB to the public?

549
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,930
What did you do abroad?

550
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,100
Everything is ready.

551
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,240
All right.

552
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,800
Let us expose it.

553
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:54,500
I'm not the one who will do this.

554
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,610
You both have to end it.

555
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,400
This was protected by your brother.

556
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,700
We'll wait until the end.

557
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,120
Catch this!

558
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,400
Hurry up!

559
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,160
Don't touch me!

560
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,300
Damn!

561
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,700
Oh my God, my God!

562
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,300
Take this!

563
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Shit!

564
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,080
Amamiya! Hurry up!

565
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,950
Hurry, Amamiya!

566
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:56,580
Be strong

567
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,200
Strong!

568
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:00,700
Strong!

569
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,720
Be strong in order to live!

570
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,590
Faster!

571
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,560
Hey

572
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:14,870
Is it done?

573
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,160
Yes

574
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:24,300
Kohaku, I really can't drive a car.

575
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,370
Yay!

576
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,100
So? Where is the car?

577
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,210
We will compensate you.

578
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,790
This afternoon, it was revealed that the casino project
promoted by the government has been abolished.

579
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,690
It's clear this time that the group named Kuryu and ...

580
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,300
some people from the National Police, too
Pulled strings in order for the project to advance.

581
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,300
Everything is now under investigation

582
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:31,870
Because it's still under investigation,
I will refrain from commenting.

583
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,500
I'm running out of time.

584
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,300
Just do it as soon as possible.

585
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,900
With this, the police also can't remain silent.

586
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,200
Looks like Kohaku did it for us.

587
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,980
It finally ended.

588
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:10,780
But...

589
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,120
I know.

590
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:19,420
Dan and the others, from now on ...

591
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,000
Stop!

592
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,370
Stop it!

593
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,500
I don't know what happened, but if you don't stop they'll die.

594
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,000
Yamato!

595
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,500
Hey, baby face.

596
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:06,100
You're part of Sannoh Rengokai?

597
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,750
I've never seen you before.

598
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,550
SWORD is interesting.

599
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,770
I'll remember your face.

600
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,550
What's wrong with these people?

601
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,000
We are the Mighty Warriors.

602
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,900
You know what it is

603
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,300
You know

604
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,000
welcome back bro

605
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,870
Jesse is back, everybody!

606
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,220
Yo Bernie, spin that shit

607
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,950
Let's go

608
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,450
welcome back, Jesse!

609
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,500
welcome back, brother!

610
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,800
welcome back, Jesse!

611
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,870
Jesse!

612
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,310
When were you released?

613
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,000
You haven't changed

614
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,150
Hey, Diddy!

615
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,700
You have returned.

616
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,000
And? Who is she?

617
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,600
Dixie.

618
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:38,100
Nice to meet you.

619
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,900
Nice to meet you too.

620
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:45,300
Jesse.

621
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,670
Who is that?

622
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,100
He is a friend from prison.

623
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:56,740
If you ask what he loves, he will answer "children"

624
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:58,450
Why?

625
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,690
We came from the same place.

626
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,550
He protects the children in Little Asia.

627
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,700
Hey everyone, Pho is back.

628
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,190
I bought a lot of food.

629
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,410
what?

630
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,130
Hey!

631
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,400
We both grew up in Little Asia.

632
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,500
After you enter Rasen, there are rules.

633
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:50,490
To protect yourself, you must choose a team.

634
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,200
Then he picked me up.

635
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,350
We came from the same hometown.

636
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,540
I have no reason to refuse.

637
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,500
I see

638
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,650
So? Why did you bring him here?

639
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,700
I want him to join the Mighty Warriors.

640
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,700
Okay

641
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,300
All right, starting today he is our friend too.

642
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:36,310
By the way, what happened to Ryu?

643
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,300
He's part of Kuryu now.

644
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:40,180
Kuryu?

645
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,000
If he wants to come back

646
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:44,880
we'll always welcome him.

647
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,690
Funk Jungle, huh?

648
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,300
Is this your ideal?

649
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:56,700
Are you interested in working with Doubt for money?

650
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,990
No

651
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,000
We're focusing on promoting this.

652
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,340
I see

653
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,200
Well, this is an easy task so I'll finish it myself.

654
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:10,350
Pho.

655
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,550
Doubt

656
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,450
They're gonna give you that much money for the job?

657
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,600
It's not just because of Doubt

658
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:23,450
I'm interested in this fight so I want to find the best support.

659
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,490
Rocky.

660
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,730
Rocky.

661
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:34,240
Rocky, are you alright?

662
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,810
Yes, I'm fine, don't worry

663
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,830
Kizzy, take them home.

664
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,700
Everyone, let's go.
Lassie and Cosette...

665
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,210
Let's go

666
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:46,950
Thank you

667
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:52,420
Rocky, Cobra is here again.

668
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,130
Will you close the club?

669
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,390
Yes

670
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,000
Until the trouble with Doubt is done.

671
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,480
It's dangerous for women.

672
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,600
Who did it?

673
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,800
Ranmaru

674
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,940
Can you reconsider the agreement?

675
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:32,460
If you do, we can help you face Doubt.

676
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,090
I can not...

677
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:40,300
depend on other people

678
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:47,400
To be independent, you must stand on your own feet.

679
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:53,470
I understand.

680
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,410
I won't interfere in your problems.

681
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:04,290
I'm sorry.

682
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,830
Just remember

683
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,270
You can contact me anytime, when you can't stand up.

684
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,800
Even if I continue to persist, it won't change anything.

685
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,300
I have to take care of it at once.

686
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,520
If we do not proceed in our own way

687
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,200
then it doesn't mean anything.

688
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,600
Love and pride.

689
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,390
Listen

690
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:43,500
Our goal is not to steal.

691
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:46,370
We try to protect.

692
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,450
Don't forget that.

693
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,940
First, we will take over the Rascals,

694
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,780
then the next is SWORD

695
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,900
What happened to the bath house?

696
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:46,090
I'm not sure yet.

697
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,030
But maybe...

698
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,500
Not just Tetsu's place.

699
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,510
Many other places will be desroyed.

700
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,000
We need to protect this city.

701
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,640
however...

702
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:09,700
what is Sannoh Rengokai fighting for?

703
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,000
Ask Noboru.

704
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,400
Noboru?

705
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:16,800
Sannoh Rengokai is where Noboru can return to, right?

706
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,500
It has nothing to do with us, so I'm not sure.

707
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:31,370
Will Daruma fall?

708
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:50,700
What nonsense is that!

709
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,200
They aren't just Doubt right?

710
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,800
Only the White Rascals.

711
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,000
It's over

712
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,000
I thought their SWORD friends would come.

713
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,470
They say they are good friends, but eventually they only think of themselves.

714
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,000
Hey, it already started!

715
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,750
You're not going?

716
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,050
Shut up

717
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,120
It seems that its not just Doubt.

718
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:23,400
Shiba, Nonoriki, give us info about Doubt.

719
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:25,560
Shiba is now in the area

720
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,600
This is Nonoriki. We will report now.

721
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,000
Those guys at that time ...

722
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:36,860
It seems that Doubt hired them.

723
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:39,300
Thank you for checking on it.

724
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:43,100
I thought it was only Doubt against the White Rascals.

725
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:44,500
Cobra.

726
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:49,400
I won't fight in this battle.

727
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:50,680
what?

728
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,250
What are you saying?

729
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,750
You want me to leave Tetsu ...

730
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,600
and go help someone who refuses to have an agreement?

731
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,430
Rocky refused the agreement ...

732
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:03,000
because he doesn't want SWORD to be involved in this battle.

733
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:05,960
Tetsu.

734
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,000
Do you think its enough just to protect the city?

735
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,300
Have you done everything you can?

736
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,150
Trust me.

737
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,410
I'm serious...

738
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:22,000
I will not go with you.

739
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,120
Dan!

740
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,250
Me too

741
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,300
Kabuto

742
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,000
I'm sorry

743
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,000
What the hell?

744
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,850
Cobra

745
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,000
Your friend is not just the people beside you.

746
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,200
Hyuga-chan

747
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,300
If I win,

748
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,280
Can you reconsider the agreement?

749
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,990
What if you lose?

750
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,190
Well,

751
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,600
I'll think about it when that happens.

752
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,760
Aren't you a scout group?

753
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,330
What?

754
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,000
At this level, women will not approach you.

755
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,000
Aren't you a scout group too?

756
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,470
You don't protect women...

757
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,370
They're just a tool to make money.

758
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:34,600
You...

759
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,600
do not understand women

760
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,390
As expected, I really hate this man.

761
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,000
Let's hurry up and attack as hard as we can.

762
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,760
But, the difference in the number of people

763
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,900
worries me a bit.

764
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,270
I'll deal with you later.

765
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:16,300
Party time

766
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:39,100
What should we do now?

767
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,200
Well, this is our job.

768
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,500
make money

769
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:03,100
Watch your step.

770
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,800
Kizzy, step aside!

771
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,500
Everyone spread out!

772
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,610
Let's go!

773
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,690
Seems like it started.

774
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,400
That's too easy

775
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,900
This will end soon.

776
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,200
stop!

777
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:47,580
get up!

778
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,380
go!

779
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,860
Attack them!

780
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:04,600
They are there too!

781
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:06,400
Teach them!

782
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,000
Hang on.

783
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:56,370
Stop!

784
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,870
Your enemy is me.

785
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:36,140
You had enough.

786
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,410
Shut up idiot

787
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,900
I'm sorry, Cobra.

788
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,300
Perfect

789
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:14,110
We will finish you together.

790
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,620
I'll face Ranmaru.

791
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,100
Hey!

792
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:13,710
Let's finish this.

793
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,840
Ready?

794
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:18,480
Let's go!

795
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,600
I just started fighting again.

796
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,500
What is this?

797
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,650
reinforcements?

798
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:02,460
Don't avoid me.

799
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,600
Make this fun for me.

800
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,700
Are you weak without cats? Boku

801
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:34,790
shit!

802
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:53,000
let's go bastards!

803
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:58,420
beat them up everyone!

804
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:59,810
Teach them!

805
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Let's go

806
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:13,700
Teach them, beat them!

807
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,850
Is this a battle cavalry?

808
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,510
That's the best!

809
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,890
Oya High's extracurricular activities begin!

810
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,400
Kizzy-chan,

811
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:06,210
goodbye

812
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:39,900
You have good friends.

813
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:41,080
What?

814
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,900
They came to Nameless Street in full costumes.

815
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:47,250
Please help them.

816
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,480
Please

817
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,790
They also helped us, so now it's our turn.

818
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,290
Ah those people...

819
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:57,590
You poor guys

820
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,800
Are you resting?

821
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,000
I'm not on duty today.

822
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,900
You really have no mercy.

823
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,200
Hyuga.

824
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:27,560
You're finally here.

825
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:46,140
Here to block your path.

826
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:54,220
You can't trust a man who kicked you out.

827
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:20,400
Don't call yourself a SWORD leader if you want to be involved with these people.

828
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:25,000
We're responsible for the festivals in SWORD.

829
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:29,580
We do it whatever way we want.

830
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:34,120
If you fight with White Rascals

831
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,500
You fight with the SWORD

832
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,200
In other words!

833
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,800
This is!

834
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:46,230
the SWORD Agreement!

835
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,740
Go!

836
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:57,760
Oh, does that hurt?

837
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,300
Stand up straight!

838
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,300
Sit!

839
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,900
Let's go

840
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,200
Oh, I'm stuck.

841
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:27,260
'sup bro?

842
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,200
You guys have nothing to do?

843
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:32,800
This is what we have to do now.

844
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,490
Ice!

845
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,700
Ice, you bastard!

846
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,300
Don't turn your back on me.

847
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,300
what are you jealous?

848
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:57,010
Change or die, baby!

849
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,800
Ranmaru's work is finished.

850
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:33,400
Rocky won't lose.

851
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,400
You have a strong friendship.

852
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:39,300
That's beautiful.

853
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:43,300
It's not just that.

854
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,000
He prepared for the worst from the start.

855
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:23,200
Our groups fighting as one ...

856
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,680
are you really ready?

857
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,580
Ah, I'm tired.

858
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:13,750
I have finished everything for Tatsuya.

859
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:23,400
We plan to visit Tatsuya in the morning.

860
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:29,250
What about your people?

861
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,000
They went to battle.

862
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:34,810
They're fighting again?

863
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,600
Even though nothing will change even if they fight.

864
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,400
That's true.

865
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,000
The fact that they are fighting

866
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:50,700
is surely wrong...

867
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:56,730
but

868
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:01,470
Their desire to fight

869
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,480
isn't wrong.

870
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,430
Hey!

871
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:14,000
Are you alright?

872
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,380
That's Japanese

873
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:35,660
Okay

874
01:53:35,770 --> 01:53:36,600
I understand.

875
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:38,500
Thanks, Ryu.

876
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:41,670
Yo! Jesse!

877
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:43,270
wait...

878
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,300
we are (leaving)

879
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:50,100
Ok, let's go

880
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:53,080
all right,

881
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,420
see you again

882
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,520
Where are you going?

883
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,800
These children...

884
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:18,070
We've been through this before.

885
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,680
Is that guy the boss?

886
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,510
It's Kuryu

887
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:43,360
Did you start this fight?

888
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:47,800
You have a pretty face.

889
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,180
Look,

890
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:07,200
Don't make things complicated.

891
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:08,600
Don't you know?

892
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:13,700
your quarrel won't solve anything

893
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:15,790
Stop!

894
01:56:19,370 --> 01:56:21,700
Why are you angry?

895
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:28,000
When anger is beyond control,

896
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:33,110
You have to deal with it with compassion.

897
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:39,600
People who are below average ...

898
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,600
think they are above the average
when they hang out with their friends.

899
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:47,230
You're a stupid kid.

900
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:52,600
Don't you understand that everyone in the SWORD must die?

901
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:59,500
In the past, the leader of Mugen ...

902
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:03,280
we got full of them and used his death as a warning.

903
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:11,280
And now, you, he's just like you, very earnest.

904
01:57:13,790 --> 01:57:17,700
Oh, he died in vain, right?

905
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:27,200
No matter how many of your members die,

906
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:30,700
it doesn't change anything.

907
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,610
You bastard.

908
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:39,810
Why?

909
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:44,200
Do you still want to fight us?

910
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:54,200
We fight at different levels.

911
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,200
I will show you.

912
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,500
We can cover everything.

913
01:58:08,810 --> 01:58:11,680
No matter how many of you die,

914
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:16,900
We can make it look like nothing happened.

915
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:24,580
The whole Kuryu will attack and destroy you all!

916
01:58:25,490 --> 01:58:28,000
You will either run away or crawl on us,

917
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,000
It's up to you!

918
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:48,710
This is my answer.

919
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,160
Casino project promoter, Minister Shinohara

920
02:00:14,270 --> 02:00:16,170
have allegedly given and received counterfeit money.

921
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:18,210
President of Kuryu Group, Kuze Ryushin

922
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:19,540
is released today

923
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:21,570
Seriously

924
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,510
It's a waste of time.

925
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,510
For

926
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:35,250
a dream ...

927
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,120
Why is he released?

928
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:41,850
All the evidence is exposed?

929
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:53,440
What's wrong?

930
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:03,300
Nothing

931
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:08,010
Did you see the news?

932
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:13,420
What's happening in this world?

933
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:21,060
This is the end for the SWORD

934
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:28,640
Do it

935
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:38,710
Finish as soon as we find the leader of Rude Boys.

936
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:45,720
Do it right

937
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:01,480
Go!

938
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:16,030
watch till after credits!
