1
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,440
Hail to thee, Lord Harihar.

2
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,160
Please answer my prayers.

3
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,880
O Lord Jagannath,

4
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,160
O sanctifier of sinners,
O saviour of the poor…

5
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,080
You're my protector
Lord Jagannath.

6
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,520
Madan, how can you
joke with God?

7
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,120
I wasn't joking, mom.

8
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
I was only praying to God
that he should protect you.

9
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,640
Get away.

10
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,320
Why haven't you
left for college?

11
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,160
I'll leave in a bit.

12
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,080
Sheela, did you serve
breakfast to your brother?

13
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,080
She already did.

14
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,800
I've had enough to eat.
I only need some money.

15
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,600
How can I provide
you with money?

16
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,880
Men should earn money and
women should cook for them.

17
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Right, but a man can start earning,
when he has completed his studies.

18
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
Before I can do that, I
must appear for exams.

19
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,720
To appear for exams, I must pay
admission fees, 200 rupees.

20
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
200 rupees!

21
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,160
After a whole month of working
hard for the committee,

22
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,640
...your father gets
paid 150 rupees.

23
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
I know, mother.
But I'm helpless.

24
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,120
Only three days left
to pay the fees.

25
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
If I don't pay up, all my
efforts will be wasted.

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,120
It's the last exam that
I must appear for.

27
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
Talk to your father about it.

28
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,320
He won't spare me a
lecture if I do that.

29
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,000
At least start talking about it.

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,080
Are you coming? -Yes, I am.

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,040
Are you sure? -Yes, sure.

32
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,400
Mom, you aren't following me.

33
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,600
Anyone there?

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
Where is everyone?

35
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,960
I was having breakfast.
-Where's your mother?

36
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,120
She's praying. -Oh, come on.

37
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,080
Someone's praying,
someone's eating.

38
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
No one's bothered about me.

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm still quite strong.

40
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
If I weren't, all of you
would've gotten rid of me.

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,320
What happened? -Look
at the collar.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
It needs some darning.

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Ram Lakhan will be
here with the laundry.

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,520
Forget about him.
Mend this first.

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm getting late for work.

46
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,880
Father. -What is it?

47
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,320
Well… it's just…

48
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,880
I have to pay exam fees.
-You need money.

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,360
I have no money.

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
Everyone only wants
money all the time.

51
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,280
Do you think it's
easy to earn money?

52
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,480
Why are you always scolding him?

53
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,520
How will he appear for the exams,
if he doesn't pay the fees?

54
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
Let him not take the exams.

55
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,160
You always support your son.

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,000
When is the exam? -It's
in the month of April,

57
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,880
…but I must pay the
fees within three days.

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
It's 200 rupees.

59
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,440
Only three days to
pay 200 rupees.

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,040
We've mortgaged our home for
the sake of your studies.

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,320
No one's willing to
lend me any money.

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,240
And he wants to pay exam
fees within three days.

64
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,480
Everyone is in a hurry.

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,040
Please try to manage this.

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,360
It's the last exam.

67
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,240
Once he has passed the exam,
he'll get a job somewhere.

68
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,400
He'll soon relieve you
of all your worries.

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
That's my only hope.

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
But what can I do right now?

71
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,040
I can't help you unless
I get my salary.

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,840
Mother.

73
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,360
Don't worry. He's angry right now.
But he'll manage to get the money.

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,520
You must go now.

75
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,320
Brother… -Yes.

76
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
I have some money
that I can lend.

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,640
Of course! How much do you have?

78
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
Ten rupees. -That's it?

79
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,040
Yes, that's it.

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,360
I've saved all the money you've
been giving me for years.

81
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,720
You mean the one rupee,
I give you every year?

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,960
Keep it safe for that one.
-Which one?

83
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,720
The one, tapping his feet. -Or
the one, swaying her hips.

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,760
How dare you! -Dad! -Madan!

85
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,680
On my way to college.

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,200
Munni, you haven't
gone to school.

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,880
No. -The English lady!

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,640
Why didn't you go?

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,560
How can I go?

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,680
All my clothes are too small.

91
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,840
You're making excuses
for avoiding school.

92
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,400
Do I miss college, because I
have to wear father's pants?

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,520
You better stop making excuses.

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,520
If I complain to
father, you had it.

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
He'll punish you.

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,880
He won't. -Such a brat!

97
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,120
Hello, aunt. -God
bless you, dear.

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,880
Hello, sir!

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
I have a permit.

100
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
A permit!

101
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,120
Jamunia, where's Ram Lakhan?
-He's inside.

102
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,040
Hey, Ram Lakhan. -Yes, sir.

103
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,480
Please come here.
-What's going on?

104
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,640
You have shaken up my family.

105
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,640
Don't touch my iron.

106
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,000
How do you say, I
shook up your family?

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Of course!

108
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,360
You don't get the clothes on time
and my father can't leave for work.

109
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,080
We need your adept fingers to
work magic on our white collars.

110
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,440
Hurry up. -Don't you
see, I'm about to leave?

111
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
Why are you arguing with me?

112
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,760
Don't walk your way there. -Why?

113
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,160
I swear by your moustache.

114
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,520
Ride your donkey. You
look like a king.

115
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
What?

116
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
Fifteen.

117
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,200
That's fifteen, ma'am.

118
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,080
Please come a little earlier.

119
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,960
Your master got late, because
he didn't have ironed clothes.

120
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll get it earlier, ma'am.

121
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Today I was late,
because it was raining.

122
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,280
Uncle Ram Lakhan, will
you wash my dress too?

123
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,480
How about a double
rate for that?

124
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,960
Double rate?

125
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Where did she learn that?

126
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
Who would give a washerman
double rate in this town?

127
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,400
We charge single only.
-Okay, single it is then.

128
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,160
But get it early in the morning.

129
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,400
I have to attend school.

130
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,280
Go away. She talks nonsense.

131
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,080
We're experiencing tough times.

132
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,800
It's difficult to buy
a new dress for her.

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,960
Right, ma'am.

134
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,280
Your lives are indeed difficult.

135
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
If a goat goes weak, it can
live on the grass around it.

136
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,040
But if a tiger goes weak,
he can't live for too long.

137
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,920
You're right. You know
about our family.

138
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,080
Of course! I remember the day,

139
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,320
...when you came here
after getting married.

140
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,320
I got a turban
with brocade work.

141
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,840
My wife got silk clothes.

142
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,240
She still remembers
that day very fondly.

143
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,840
Your father-in-law was here.

144
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
The family was so prosperous.

145
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,960
Gone are the days, Ram Lakhan.

146
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,960
Now there are only memories.

147
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,800
Wait until master Madan
completes his studies.

148
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,720
He's our only hope.

149
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
Good bye, ma'am.

150
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,120
Mind your pawns. -You
mind your queen.

151
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,600
Won't you say hello, Mr. Soni?

152
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
There goes! -Okay.

153
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,600
Another pawn is out. -Okay.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,520
Here goes another one.

155
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
What is that?

156
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,320
Strange people.

157
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,920
They come whenever they want.

158
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,760
It's not that strange, Mr. Soni.

159
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,880
Madan, how long have you been here?
-Long ago.

160
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,680
Please take care of that. My
horse's life is in danger.

161
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,640
Just take a look.

162
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,440
Sure!

163
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,720
Three gallons.

164
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,280
What are you doing?

165
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh no!

166
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
I'm sorry, ma'am.
It was a mistake.

167
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,480
You spoiled my clothes.

168
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,040
I haven't spoiled them.
They're dry washed.

169
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
They're dry washed with petrol.

170
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,840
I wanted the petrol for
the car, not my clothes.

171
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
I'll pay the price for
three gallons only.

172
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
But it shows six gallons.

173
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,280
Please charge her for
three gallons only.

174
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
I'll pay the rest.

175
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
She may not have enough to pay.
-Shut up.

176
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,440
Aren't you ashamed?

177
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,960
Please take your change.
-Give it to your boss.

178
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,080
Why did you do that?

179
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,400
You enraged a good customer.

180
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,160
If we lose customers like this,

181
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,000
…we'll have to shut
the petrol pump down.

182
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,360
Do you think it'll shut down,
or will you start a new one?

183
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,160
You got the money for six gallons
of petrol instead of three.

184
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,360
Why are you cribbing?

185
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,960
Let's get back to chess.

186
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,960
Why are you swatting flies?

187
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,400
Don't you have enough customers?
-No, Madan.

188
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,880
Neither customers nor
death is to be seen.

189
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,080
Are you coming in? -There!

190
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
She's calling out to me.

191
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,320
Lunch must be served.
-Right now?

192
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,960
Oh, I see. It's in your faith.

193
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,600
You have dinner before sundown.

194
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,760
We must. What if nocturnal
insects fell in the food?

195
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,600
You eat any kind of meat.

196
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,120
I'll take your leave.

197
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,680
Madan, will you stay for some time?
-Why?

198
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,640
If there are customers… -Of course.
Have your dinner.

199
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,920
No one's going to visit.

200
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,640
You may go.

201
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,680
I'll sit down here.

202
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,360
For coating, voting,
shooting or shirting.

203
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,080
You'll find a variety
of fabrics here.

204
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,960
You!

205
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,480
Yes, it's me.

206
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,600
Weren't you at the petrol pump?
-Me, at the petrol pump?

207
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,840
Oh, no. He is the younger one.

208
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,760
I'm the elder one.

209
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm a human being, not
God, who is omnipresent.

210
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,640
It seems you had been
to a petrol pump.

211
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,400
Please show me a
'Lal Imli' fabric.

212
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,360
'Lal Imli'?

213
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,160
You must be joking.

214
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
Is that even a name?

215
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,440
Strange! Don't you know
it's a type of fabric?

216
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,080
Oh, 'Lal Imli'!

217
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,880
I'm sorry, we don't have it.
We have 'Hari Imli'.

218
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,280
What? - 'Hari Imli'.

219
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,840
We have written to 'Lal Imli'
to grant us the dealership.

220
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,880
Do you have Dhariwal? -Why
don't you check for yourself?

221
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Here you are.

222
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,400
This one? -No.

223
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,680
Then, is it this one? -No.

224
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,680
This one's beautiful.

225
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
No?

226
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,480
What about this one?

227
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
These are the best.

228
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,720
Show me some 'dupattas'.

229
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,080
We have dozens of them.

230
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,360
Here you are.

231
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,560
It's chiffon.

232
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,320
Here you are. It's nylon.

233
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,560
And this one.

234
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,720
It's a red one in 'mulmul'.

235
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,680
But I want a white 'dupatta'.

236
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,200
What? -A white dupatta.

237
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,080
White.

238
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,440
There's the white one.

239
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,280
What are you doing?
That's my 'dupatta'.

240
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,920
Of course, it's yours.

241
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,680
The entire shop is yours.

242
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,640
Here you are.

243
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
Mannerless fool!

244
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
I don't want the 'dupatta'.

245
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,480
What do you want? -Nothing.

246
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,720
Are you a shopkeeper, or a fool?

247
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,440
I'm sorry, ma'am.

248
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,960
Ma'am, please give me the money.

249
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,880
What happened?

250
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,080
Take care of the shop. The
customer left without paying.

251
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,560
Take this.

252
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,480
Excuse me, is there
a florist around?

253
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,040
It's at that corner.

254
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,720
Jumman, give me the cap
and the cigarette. -Why?

255
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,720
Give me that.

256
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,960
Now go away for a minute.

257
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,920
What's the matter? -A lady
is coming to buy flowers.

258
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,880
She speaks English.
You don't understand.

259
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,480
Okay, you take care of her.

260
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
Excuse me. -Yes.

261
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,920
Please make me a bouquet.

262
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Sure, I'll make one for you.

263
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,920
Place it in vases
or flower pots.

264
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,880
They're fresh, fragrant flowers.

265
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,320
The bouquet must be beautiful.

266
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,440
Price isn't a concern.

267
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,880
Wonderful!

268
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,440
If we have customers like you,
we can give away our hearts.

269
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,320
Daffodils, marigold,
lilies and bluebells.

270
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
But I want roses. -Why not?

271
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,200
Here you are. A bunch
of fresh roses.

272
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,760
It's you again.

273
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,240
Yes.

274
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,080
I get it.

275
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,200
Anyone, who comes that way,
mistakes me for my brother.

276
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,800
They were Maganlal and Sadanlal.

277
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,840
I'm Chhaganlal, their
eldest brother.

278
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,120
I sound different.

279
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,040
But both of them look exactly…

280
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,280
The three of us are triplets.

281
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,360
Triple fools.

282
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,840
That's why we look…

283
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm sorry, but your
brothers are rude.

284
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,080
They're quite young and foolish.

285
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,040
Okay. Do you have
creepers for gardens?

286
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,800
Look at this one.

287
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,200
The night-blooming jasmine.

288
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
This one blooms during the day.

289
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,720
And that one…

290
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
…is the lover's bud. -Excuse me?

291
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,400
Don't you get it?

292
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,320
Lover, the one in love.

293
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,640
And the bud, that’s the flower.

294
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,760
Is that clear now?

295
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,800
Scoundrel, cheat, shameless!

296
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
Where are you going? -To hell.

297
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,080
Wait!

298
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,400
You'll see one of my brothers.

299
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,240
Gaganlal. Say hello to him.

300
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,080
What happened?

301
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,400
She threw a bunch of flowers.

302
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,680
Mind you, Madan.

303
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,960
All wounds heal, but those
from a flower rarely do.

304
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,720
What a pity!

305
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,760
She left without accepting
flowers from me.

306
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,880
What is going on here?

307
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,680
Nothing, father.

308
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,080
Come on, let's go home.

309
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,640
Shameless. Brazen.

310
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,640
You're always whiling away time at a
blacksmith, cobbler or florist's.

311
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,360
If you want to be friends
with these people,

312
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
...why mortgage our home for
the sake of your education?

313
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,520
I've told you a thousand times…

314
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,200
...you should spend
time with equals.

315
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
But you don't seem to get it.

316
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,520
Shameless!

317
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,560
I've told you a thousand times… you
should spend time with equals.

318
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,240
But you don't seem to get it.

319
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,080
You're back, Indu.

320
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,000
Yes. Can't you see? -What?

321
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,840
Of course, I can see you.

322
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,680
If you did, you wouldn't
praise this town so much.

323
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,800
My dear, there's no city like
this one in the whole country.

324
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,960
It seems you've never been
beyond the limits of this city.

325
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,520
Your next destination
will be Heaven.

326
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
It won't be as good
as this either.

327
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Lovely city and the
people are lovelier.

328
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,160
Don't say that. I haven't
seen one decent person.

329
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
They're rude and mannerless.

330
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
They interfere with everything.

331
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,960
They're friendly people.

332
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,960
They love helping others.

333
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,240
I was trying to buy
something… -Buying?

334
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,000
You went shopping
all by yourself?

335
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,240
If you start doing things all
by yourself, what would we do?

336
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,160
If I were with you, you'd buy
anything worth a rupee for two.

337
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
What? -I mean, help you get
things at a cheaper rate.

338
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
Mr. Accountant,
what's the matter?

339
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,000
Anything worth a rupee for two?

340
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
Is it cheap or expensive?

341
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,280
If you buy, it's
quite expensive.

342
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,960
If you don't, it's cheap.

343
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,760
My dear, why are you so sad?

344
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,080
Father, it was a huge mistake…

345
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,120
...that we left a huge city
like Delhi to settle down here.

346
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,160
Now that I'm a pensioner, why
not settle down in my hometown?

347
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,240
This place is special for me.

348
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,800
I feel connected to
everything around.

349
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,320
I spent my childhood here.

350
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,680
Your mother and I started
our life together here.

351
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,160
But I don't like it here, dad.

352
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
You don't have to spend
all your life here.

353
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,280
I'll get you married soon.

354
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,040
You'll move to a bigger city.

355
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
You'll have a wonderful
life partner.

356
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,760
But sir, there are
boys in this town.

357
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,360
They're all fine men. -Not a word, Mr.
Accountant.

358
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,280
My dear, please try to
finish your graduation here.

359
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,120
What if the college
isn't good enough?

360
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,680
You'll be glad to
see the college.

361
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,880
It's a two-storey building.

362
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,080
Girls and boys study together.

363
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,600
You leave.

364
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,480
What did you say? -Leave.

365
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,360
Okay.

366
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,520
There's no reason to worry.

367
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,360
You'll like it there.

368
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,600
Madan, come here.

369
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,360
The professor is here.

370
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,120
Please come in.

371
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,640
Sit down, please.

372
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,560
Students, you'll
be glad to know…

373
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,800
…we have a new student, who
has migrated from Delhi.

374
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,280
Her name is Indumati.

375
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm sure, she'll
like our college.

376
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,680
Take a seat.

377
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Not there.

378
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,040
Prakash, please shift here.

379
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Sit.

380
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,320
Silence, please.

381
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
I have the results
for your exams.

382
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
I'm sorry for those
who've failed.

383
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,840
But I'm also glad that…
one of the students,

384
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,760
...who have passed...
has worked really hard.

385
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,520
He has also opened up new avenues
in the field of criticism.

386
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,760
This student is not only
excellent at studies,

387
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,360
but also excels at sports.

388
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,360
The name of the student
is Madanlal Malhotra.

389
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,400
Silence, please.

390
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,520
I want each of you to read
Madan's answer sheet carefully.

391
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,960
You'll notice that his answers are
clear, brief and to the point.

392
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,560
You may take it from me
after the lecture is over.

393
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,960
Now, open your books.

394
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,080
Page 63, second paragraph.

395
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,120
Excuse me, may I have
your answer paper?

396
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,240
Sure!

397
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,960
If you don't mind,
may I drop you home?

398
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,960
Thank you.

399
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,120
I was really mistaken yesterday.

401
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,040
You can't tell until you
come closer to someone.

402
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,320
But how did you manage to be
present at all the places?

403
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,800
All I can say is that the
marketplace is like home.

404
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,960
Is it?

405
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm glad we've met.

406
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,520
I thought, there are no
decent people in the city.

407
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,600
Nothing to see, no
markets to shop at.

408
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,640
You haven't seen the city yet.

409
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,120
There are some posh neighbourhoods,
huge bungalows and rich owners.

410
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,880
Which way do we go?

411
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
There.

412
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,360
Don't you live near the
place we met yesterday?

413
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,520
How can you say that?

414
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,200
Do all Parliament members
live in the Parliament house?

415
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,480
It's the place, where
business takes place.

416
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,880
Where's your bungalow?

417
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,800
My bungalow?

418
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,640
It's right there.

419
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,320
Is it close by?

420
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,560
Well…

421
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,880
…it must be close by.

422
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,520
There!

423
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,080
Where? -Right behind
the cement pipes.

424
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
That one, over there.

425
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,080
Does this bungalow belong to you?
-No, to my father.

426
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,360
Do you have a problem?

427
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Not at all. The bungalow
belongs to your father.

428
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,240
Why would I have a problem?

429
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,800
May I drive in through the gate?
-Oh, no!

430
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,280
I'll get off outside.

431
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,640
It wouldn't be a problem.
I would've driven in.

432
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,280
Thanks a lot.

433
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,720
My father may not like it.

434
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,240
He may misunderstand, if
he saw us together. Bye.

435
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,040
Diwan, Kulwant Rai.

436
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,440
Diwan, Kulwant Rai?
Where? -There.

437
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,760
Oh, Diwan Kulwant Rai.

438
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,960
He's my father.

439
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,040
I see.

440
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,880
Good bye.

441
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,960
Hello, dear. -Hello.

442
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,760
What took you so
long at college?

443
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,120
Are you Mr. Diwan? -No,
he's in his room upstairs.

444
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,440
He's working on a case file.

445
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,400
Who are you? -I'm
the accountant.

446
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,960
You mea, the money man.

447
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
It's nice to meet you.

448
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,680
I wanted to see you. -What for?

449
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,680
I'll tell you. Let's go in.

450
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,160
I wanted to talk to you.

451
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,880
Well, actually… -What is it?

452
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,520
What can I do for you? -I'll
do something for you.

453
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,720
Please sit down.

454
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
Sit down. -Please sit down.

455
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,840
Sit down. -Sit down.

456
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,280
So, what's the matter?

457
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,640
Well…

458
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,920
Actually…

459
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,360
Well, actually…

460
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,480
Your house is lovely.

461
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,680
It is. But what's the matter?

462
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,200
Well, actually…

463
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,160
Insurance.

464
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,640
#NAME?

465
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,440
Savings are very essential.

466
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,840
You can save by
investing in insurance.

467
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,320
So, you're an insurance agent.
-Yes. You may say so.

468
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,120
But I have no children.
-You'll have them soon.

469
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,760
There's no hope.

470
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
Did you consult a doctor?

471
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,400
What did he say?

472
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,880
Get married.

473
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,400
Get married?

474
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,560
But we've met only
a couple of times.

475
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,080
To me. -You?

476
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,160
The doctor said that.

477
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,200
That means, you are… -Unmarried.

478
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,160
Actually, men in our family
often end up single.

479
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,200
What do you mean?

480
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,240
Your father must've
been married.

481
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,520
Father?

482
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,040
What are you saying?

483
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
If he wasn't married,
how would you be born?

484
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,240
Me? -No, me.

485
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,400
That's fine.

486
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,360
Investing in insurance is
essential if you're not married.

487
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,880
They say, blood
relations don't help.

488
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,760
You children leave you.

489
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,160
Your savings are
your only support.

490
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,200
That's right, but I can't get
an insurance. I'm diabetic.

491
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,760
Diabetes?

492
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,400
Then I think, you'll be…

493
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Dead! -Dead?

494
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,400
How did you come in?

495
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,120
I thought, I should take
a look at your home.

496
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,960
By all means.

497
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
If this is your home, where am I?
-In my bungalow.

498
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,720
Actually, I got her along.

499
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,720
Hello. But… -He's right.
I came in with him.

500
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,320
You're with him, he's with you.

501
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,320
Who am I with?

502
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,440
What's commotion all about?

503
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,040
Who's that? -My father.

504
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,640
If that's your father,
what about hers?

505
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,680
Indu. -That's my father.

506
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Where's my father?

507
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,640
Mr. Accountant.
-That's my father.

508
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,280
Strange! Everyone's
father's here.

509
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,040
It's time to run.

510
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,960
Hey, listen.

511
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,400
Mr. Accountant. -Father!

512
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,680
What is this, father?
-Insurance papers.

513
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,280
I'll have to apply for a loan
to pay for your exam fees.

514
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,560
Is it? -As per my calculations,
we gain absolutely nothing.

515
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,320
I haven't repaid the interest
on the previous loan.

516
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
What about my exam fees?

517
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,840
What can I say?

518
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,840
We won't have money, until
I receive the salary.

519
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,360
Ask the principal for a
week's time if you can.

520
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,800
How is that possible?

521
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,120
It's a University exam.

522
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,600
What can I do about it?

523
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Steal, rob or consume poison?

524
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Why are you staring at me?
At least try asking.

525
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,840
How much is that? -Hundred.

526
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Here's another hundred.

527
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,400
Sir, please be careful with it.
-Don't worry.

528
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,960
Mr. Melaram. -Just a moment.

529
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,960
Madan.

530
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,560
Finally, you have paid
the admission fees.

531
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,240
You must've been
worried, but so was I.

532
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,720
I was worried.

533
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,440
It's so obvious, those who
have money, have no brains.

534
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,880
No brain.

535
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,040
Those who have brains,
have no money.

536
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,920
No money.

537
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,440
No one knows God's plans.

538
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,640
If you couldn't have enrolled,

539
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,720
it would've been a
loss for the nation.

540
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,560
It would've been
a national loss.

541
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Are you walking home, Mr. Madan.
-Do you have a problem?

542
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,880
Of course. If a talented man
like you has to walk home...

543
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,680
…he won't have time for studies.

544
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,480
If he has not time for studies,
he won't pass the exams.

545
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,760
If he doesn't pass, it
would be a national loss.

546
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,880
I promise, the nation won't
lose anything even if I'm dead.

547
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,800
You may go.

548
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,720
Excuse me.

549
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,160
You took me to your
home yesterday.

550
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,000
Now, tell me where my home is.

551
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,520
You're poking fun at me.

552
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,760
I'm very sorry for
what I did yesterday.

553
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,040
You're such a sensible man.

554
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,720
Why did you do that?

555
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,560
You probably won't understand.

556
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,760
Someone said, 'you
smile so often'.

557
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,800
'How much pain is
hidden behind it?'

558
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,080
When poor people smile, they
hide their pain and tears.

559
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,040
You may never know.

560
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,560
Each time I
experience happiness,

561
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,920
I want it to last as
long as possible.

562
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,880
I don't care even
if I have to lie.

563
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,960
You had to lie.

564
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,960
Does that mean, you liked
being around with me?

565
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,840
I still do.

566
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,960
Thanks for the compliment.

567
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,200
Before getting into
the new business,

568
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,560
have you consulted
Sadanlal and Chhaganlal?

569
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,960
Sadanlal and Chhaganlal quickly
agree with whatever Madanlal says.

570
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,520
Is it? -Yes.

571
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,600
Stop at that corner.
That's where I'll get off.

572
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,240
I'll drop you home.

573
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,160
Oh, no.

574
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,160
I don't want to get used to it.

575
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,240
Thank you.

576
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,640
Bye. -Bye.

577
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,360
Tell me where the idol is?
-I don't know.

578
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,520
I'll break your bones! -What
are you doing, mother?

579
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,720
Why are you beating her up?
-Because she deserves that!

580
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,520
She has grown older,

581
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,880
...but can't tell the difference
between an idol and a doll.

582
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Go away. -Look at that.

583
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,480
I wonder where she
took the idol.

584
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm responsible for that.

585
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,160
You!

586
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,640
Yes.

587
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,840
I didn't know how to arrange
money for the fees.

588
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,360
So, I took the idol… -Sold it?

589
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,640
I didn't sell it. I gaged it.

590
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,240
Good Lord!

591
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,320
You gaged the idol!

592
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,960
The idol of Lord Jagannath.

593
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,800
He's the Lord we worship.

594
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,560
That's terrible, Madan.

595
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Why do you think so, mother?

596
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,560
You told me, each time His
devotees are in trouble...

597
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,360
He protects them.

598
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,080
Today, he had to be given away
so that we get what we want.

599
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,360
I haven't gaged the God
that resides in your heart.

600
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,600
It was only a piece of silver.

601
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,360
I don't understand your logic.

602
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,160
We have faced a lot of
difficulties so far...

603
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,200
...but no one ever thought
of gaging the idol.

604
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,280
I wonder what we'll
have to face.

605
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,600
Don't worry, mom.

606
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,960
When I start earning,

607
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,880
getting your idol back
will be my first priority.

608
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,480
Madan.

609
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,920
Did the principal allow you
to pay the fees later?

610
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,560
I have paid the fees already.

611
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,440
You did!

612
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,600
Where did you get
the money from?

613
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,320
Well, actually… -Well.

614
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,880
I gave him the money.

615
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,600
How did you manage that?

616
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,040
I had saved some
from… the money,

617
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,240
you give me for daily expenses.

618
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,880
You had savings!

619
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,360
Really?

620
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,760
If it wasn't for you,

621
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,400
I would've been
in great trouble.

622
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,000
Forgive me, son.

623
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,320
I was disappointed with myself,

624
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,800
...so, I kept scolding
and avoiding you.

625
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,160
But it was killing
me from within.

626
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,600
It was excruciating.

627
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,520
We have our hopes pinned on you.

628
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,280
Start preparing for your exams.
-Sure, father.

629
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,360
Indu, come here.

630
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,040
Congratulations, you've passed.

631
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,520
Congratulations to you too!

632
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,200
I must go, I've to
tell my father.

633
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,800
I'll drop you in the car.

634
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
I don't need the car.

635
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,560
I think I'll just fly back home.

636
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,880
Sheela.

637
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,240
Munni! Where is everyone?

638
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,880
Mother!

639
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,520
I passed the exams!

640
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,600
Sheela.

641
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,720
Sheela.

642
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,560
Brother!

643
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,200
Sheela, I passed the exams.

644
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,600
Really?

645
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
You owe me a hundred!

646
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,960
Brother!

647
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,800
Munni, I passed the exams.

648
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,560
I passed!

649
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,200
Munni. -Mother, brother
passed the exams.

650
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,640
Get some sweets from
the sweet shop.

651
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,400
Yes, get it. -Tell him
we'll pay the rest later.

652
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,520
Tell him, we won't pay the rest.

653
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,480
Brother, has everyone
else passed?

654
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,120
Many other boys
have also passed.

655
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,560
None of the girls?
-What did you say?

656
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,640
What are you doing?

657
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,280
Will you get me a new dress?

658
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,360
Why not? I'll get
a dozen of them.

659
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,520
We'll get Sheela married
with great pomp.

660
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,600
Mom. – Mom.

661
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,320
I'll take mom for a pilgrimage.
-Really?

662
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,280
Of course! -What's the matter?

663
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,120
Where are you taking your mother?
-Father! I passed the exams.

664
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,520
No!

665
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,400
That's right. I just came
back from the college.

666
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,000
Really? -Yes, father.

667
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,800
Congratulations, son!

668
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
The God has answered my prayers.

669
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,120
Son, you've got to take
care of everything now.

670
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,680
I am too tired now.

671
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,080
Father, it's a happy occasion.

672
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,960
Do you think I…

673
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,160
These are tears of happiness.

674
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,320
They're washing away all
the sadness and worries.

675
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,080
It seems as if…

676
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,960
someone just relieved
me… of a huge burden,

677
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,960
I'd been carrying all my life.

678
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,040
It's not you.

679
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I have passed.

680
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,120
Now you must look for a job.

681
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,080
My friend Premnath… is an
officer at the Secretariat.

682
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,640
You must meet him.

683
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,360
He'll offer you a good job
based on your qualification.

684
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,000
Of course, he will.

685
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,520
Let's celebrate
with some sweets.

686
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,880
Here you are, son.

687
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,880
Listen…

688
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,560
I can't do much.

689
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,520
Even if it was my son, I
wouldn't be able to help.

690
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,120
These days, it's quite difficult
to find Government jobs.

691
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,200
Even if there's a
single vacancy,

692
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,920
...there are thousands of graduates
on the waiting list already.

693
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,080
Could you tell me what I can do?

694
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,480
What can I say?

695
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,560
Why do you want a
Government job only?

696
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,400
Why don't you try
at other places?

697
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,320
Okay.

698
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,120
Bye.

699
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,680
Hello. -Hello.

700
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,760
Please sit down.

701
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,680
Mr. Madanlal, I read
your application.

702
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,520
We're looking for people, who
have a degree in teaching.

703
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,240
You're only a graduate.

704
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,480
I'm very sorry.

705
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,120
If I get a teaching degree,
can I become a teacher?

706
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,560
That's hard to say.

707
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,920
We had only two vacancies. But
we received five applications.

708
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,440
Thank you.

709
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,080
So, you can take up office work.
-Yes.

710
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,960
There's no vacancy
in the office.

711
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,320
We need people in the
technical department.

712
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,520
Do you have any experience?

713
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,000
I have no experience in
the technical field.

714
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,200
I'm very sorry.

715
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,800
Next.

716
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,360
Madanlal Malhotra. B.A.,
Punjab University.

717
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,960
Your registration number is 555.

718
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,080
Next.

719
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,040
May I ask you a question?
-Of course, you can.

720
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,320
When can I expect my turn?

721
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,040
It's difficult to say.

722
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,440
There are thousands of
candidates on the waiting list.

723
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,280
They are not only B.A. students.

724
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,680
There are B.A., L.L.B., M.A. and
others with even higher degrees.

725
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,600
Actually, Mr. Madan…

726
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,360
...ninety per cent
of young men today,

727
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,440
...want to work in offices.

728
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
There aren't as many offices.

729
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,800
What are you doing?

730
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,240
Where did you get the
sewing machine from?

731
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,480
It belongs to one of
brother's friends.

732
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,200
Once I've learnt using it,

733
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,120
I'll earn some money. -Money?

734
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,080
Do we have to stitch
clothes to earn money?

735
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,480
Has that ever happened
in our family?

736
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,720
I'm sure it's his idea.

737
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,760
Where is he?

738
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,200
Madan!

739
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,720
Madan. -Yes, father.

740
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,480
Take this machine
back right now.

741
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,480
What about your job?

742
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,720
I haven't got one.
-Didn't get one.

743
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,840
Drown yourself and die!

744
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,520
With such great difficulty, I
let you study until graduation.

745
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,200
You should help your old father.

746
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,120
Instead, you're doing nothing.

747
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,600
It's not my fault, father.

748
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,000
I've been visiting so many
places, asking for work.

749
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,680
But there are no jobs at all.

750
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,680
How is that possible?

751
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,440
Undergraduates have
high-paying jobs.

752
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,200
Matriculates have
Government and police jobs.

753
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,960
How can you not find one?

754
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,800
What are you talking
about, father?

755
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,480
Times have changed.

756
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,880
How have the times changed?

757
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,480
Have the tigers turned vegetarian,
or started working with farmers?

758
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,600
I'm sure you aren't
trying enough.

759
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,240
You want to enjoy
without having to work.

760
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,400
I have a feeling…

761
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,040
until I breathe my last…

762
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,400
I will have to feed the family.

763
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,560
Get out of my sight.

764
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,400
Enter the house, only after
you've earned some money.

765
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:02,720
There's no God like Ram and
no brother like Lakshman.

766
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:10,560
There's no woman like Sita and
no river as pure as the Ganga.

767
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,040
Hey, Master Madan.

768
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,600
What brings your highness here?

769
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,280
I'm in no mood for jokes.

770
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,960
It's a really tough time.

771
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,520
What happened, son?
-What can I say?

772
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,760
My house was mortgaged, so
that I could study up to B.A.

773
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,240
All the effort seems
to be useless.

774
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,160
I can't find a job. -A job?

775
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,360
Why would anyone give you a job?

776
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,240
What do you mean?

777
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,840
You've studied so hard.

778
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,080
All I can do, is write my name.

779
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,880
But I have a full-time job
that pays me sufficiently.

780
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,120
But you won't take
up a job like that.

781
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,600
What do you mean?
-Just go for it.

782
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,280
Whatever you're
offered, say 'yes'.

783
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,200
Why would educated people
like you take up such a job?

784
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,400
You want white-collar jobs.

785
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,840
Crisp, ironed collars, pants
with a straight crease.

786
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,920
You can't take up anything
that involves labour.

787
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,840
Labour? Why not?

788
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,640
If you do, what about the
reputation of your family?

789
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,720
What about the honour
of your forefathers?

790
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,160
What would the
world have to say?

791
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,720
If an educated man like you
takes up a laborious task…

792
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,760
…you'll make a difference.

793
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,000
All you must ask of God is
to keep your hands intact.

794
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,240
The drops of sweat that fall off
your body, when you toil hard...

795
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,560
…turn into precious pearls.

796
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,040
You have an idol
of Lord Jagannath.

797
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,280
Have you ever thought
why it has no hands?

798
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,960
The Lord cut His hands off
and gave them to man.

799
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,400
He gave them to you and to me.

800
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,960
He gave them to
everyone in the world.

801
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,800
Everyone uses their
hands while working.

802
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,520
A potter uses his hands
to make his ware.

803
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,680
Men working in industries
use their hands.

804
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,320
If you're blessed with
two strong hands,

805
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,840
but you can't feed yourself,
then you're being ungrateful.

806
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,840
What are you blabbering?

807
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,920
Don't you have work to do?

808
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,560
Of course, I do. -Take this.

809
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,800
Sorry, master.

810
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,120
I dared to advise an
educated man like you.

811
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,280
Ram Lakhan!

812
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,600
Yes, master.

813
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,320
What happened?

814
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,440
You've enlightened me!

815
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,600
You taught me something new!

816
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,520
Enlightened? -Yes.

817
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,040
I won't bother about
reputation anymore.

818
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,120
I'll learn your trade. -No!

819
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,480
Have you lost it?

820
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,480
I had lost it, but
now I'm a wise man.

821
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,160
Give me your blessings.
-God bless.

822
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,080
I didn't want you to do this.

823
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,400
I'm in a fix. What
about your father?

824
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,840
I'm sorry. That was by mistake.

825
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,800
Mistake! You spoiled my suit.

826
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,520
It was by mistake.

827
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,360
Give me your suit.
I'll clean it for you.

828
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,680
Should I stand naked until then?

829
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,080
Am I your father's slave?

830
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,160
None of my father's slaves are naked.
-Shut up!

831
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,320
How dare a washerman
argue with me?

832
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,280
Do you expect washermen
to not say a word?

833
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,280
Shut up, you brute!

834
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,200
How dare you talk
to me like that!

835
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,160
Why should I listen
to your rude remarks?

836
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,320
I say, stop that nonsense!

837
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,840
Do you know, who you're talking to?
-Yes.

838
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,680
To a man, who thinks
no end of himself.

839
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,200
What did you say? -A snob!

840
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,160
You could've also been
careful while walking.

841
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,520
There aren't as many stains as
the amount of rubbish you said.

842
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,040
Do you want me hanged to death?
-Yes, I will.

843
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,400
Do you see this washerman?

844
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,360
This rascal is arguing with me.

845
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,600
A washerman, who cleans
dirt is a rascal.

846
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,920
And the one, who makes
things dirty is a gentleman.

847
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,040
Shut up! -Will you?

848
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,320
Even washermen dare
to argue these days.

849
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,400
Such a snob!

850
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,840
I'm sorry that I'm late.

851
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,680
Before coming here, I had
an argument with a snob.

852
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,760
We have such fools
settled in our town.

853
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,000
What are you thinking, Indumati?
-Nothing.

854
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,880
I'm thinking of the person,
I'm going to marry.

855
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,720
Good! Think about it.

856
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,960
There's nothing to think about.

857
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,800
Father must've made
the right decision.

858
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,680
He is a Labour Welfare Officer.

859
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,600
That's right.

860
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,920
He's from a well-to-do family.

861
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,840
He gets paid a thousand
rupees per month.

862
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,840
That's great.

863
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,240
His salary makes me
want to marry him.

864
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,080
Go away! Shameless!

865
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,600
Why do you think, I'm shameless?

866
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,160
Try comparing us.

867
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,480
A Labour Welfare Officer
and a labour, who labours.

868
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,240
There's no officer. -I don't
want to marry an officer.

869
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,280
You're always joking.

870
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,480
I've spoken with my
father about you.

871
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,960
You must see him
tomorrow morning.

872
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,720
You spoke with him?
What did he say?

873
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,200
Why don't you meet him first?

874
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,280
I can't come in the morning.
I've to go to the washermen's.

875
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,960
Why? -I've started
washing clothes.

876
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,680
You don't get it?
Washing clothes.

877
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,080
You're joking again.

878
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:35,880
That's incredible.

879
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,040
It's the first time that I spoke the
truth but you think I'm joking.

880
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,000
I've actually joined
the washermen.

881
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,040
What do you mean? -I mean,
after learning the art,

882
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,800
I'll go to a new city to learn
washing, dyeing, printing and…

883
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,160
Enough. Stop explaining.

884
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,440
I'm sure you'll do well, no
matter what you choose to do.

885
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,440
Why not?

886
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,640
It's indeed progress.

887
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,880
My grandfather was
an accountant.

888
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,200
My father is a treasurer.

889
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,280
And I have progressed
to become a washerman.

890
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,960
I am okay with whatever
you choose to do.

891
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,440
But don't tell everything
about yourself to my father.

892
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,240
Otherwise, all my
efforts will be wasted.

893
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,880
Do you think I'm a baby?

894
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,440
I'll leave no stone unturned
to impress your father.

895
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,760
He'll be mighty impressed
with this educated washerman.

896
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,680
What nonsense!
-Wait, listen to me.

897
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,960
I was joking.

898
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,840
If you talk nonsense,
I'll just leave.

899
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,200
Hello, Madan.

900
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,680
Hello, Ms. Indu.

901
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,600
Ms. Indu? -Yes.

902
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,720
Why are you being
so gentlemanlike?

903
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,720
It's a deliberate effort.

904
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,480
Where is your father? -He
is out, but he'll be back.

905
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,320
Then, I'll forget about
being a gentleman.

906
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,080
When he's around, I'm
going to floor him.

907
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,200
Stop joking, Madan.

908
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,360
This meeting will decide the
fate of our relationship.

909
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,320
Don't worry.

910
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,640
We're going to be lucky.

911
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,320
Convincing your
father is as easy…

912
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,040
He is… -My father.

913
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,720
Is he your father?

914
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,240
No! How is that possible?
-What are you saying?

915
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,640
I mean, you're so
short-tempered.

916
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,880
But he is…

917
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,480
He seems so calm…

918
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,960
…and so friendly.

919
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,360
Nice!

920
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,800
His eyes shine with wisdom.

921
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,480
But I can't take it.
-Stop blabbering.

922
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,240
I mean, I must prepare
well to meet him.

923
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,320
I'll take your leave now.

924
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,440
Give me your blessings, father.

925
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,640
May God bless you, son.

926
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,120
Father!

927
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,760
Give me your blessings, father.
-May God bless you.

928
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,200
Get up.

929
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,120
Father, this is Madan.

930
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,720
I see.

931
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,080
How are you, son?
-I'm doing great.

932
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,920
Sit down. Let's have some tea.

933
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,520
Indu, you may go upstairs.

934
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,600
Indu has been
praising you a lot.

935
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,920
Son, why don't you sit down.

936
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,880
What happened? Are you okay?

937
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,160
I've caught cold. -Do
you want medicine?

938
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,320
I don't need medicines.

939
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,640
I have a feeling,
we've met before.

940
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,960
I think the same.

941
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,080
But I don't remember.

942
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,360
Anyway…

943
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,240
So, you've completed your studies.
-Yes.

944
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,800
What do you plan to do next?

945
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,040
I want to open a laundry,

946
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,880
...where I'll offer dyeing,
printing and washing services.

947
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,160
You'll need a lot of money.
-That's right.

948
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,280
What does your father do?
-He deals in money.

949
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,200
Is he a money-lender?
-No, a treasurer.

950
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,840
A treasurer? -Yes.

951
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,640
Have some tea.

952
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,920
Then, you may have
inherited a decent amount.

953
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,400
What did you grandfather do?

954
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,760
He was in the estate business.

955
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,600
He was a landlord.
-He was a landlord,

956
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,280
...but he donated all his
land before he passed away.

957
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,640
If that's the case, how will you
arrange money for the business?

958
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,840
Sir, I believe in hard
work and my own belief.

959
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,080
Having belief isn't enough.

960
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,080
What are you doing right now?

961
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,160
Right now? I'm talking to you.

962
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,680
I mean, what do you
do for a living?

963
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,880
I'm not working. I'm learning.

964
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,880
There's no institute, where
you can learn the trade.

965
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,240
Actually… -Sir, please
paper the sign.

966
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,760
What are you saying?
-Sign the papers.

967
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,520
How are you, my friend?
-Very well.

968
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,040
Do you know him?

969
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,160
Yes, I know him.

970
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,080
Are you friends now?

971
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,880
Friends? When did we fight?

972
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,760
You didn't fight, but yesterday
at the washermen's corner…

973
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,680
I knew we had met before.

974
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,480
So, you were the one.

975
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,040
Are you a washerman?

976
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,600
Well, we could say that.

977
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,520
You can call me a washerman.
-Of course, I will.

978
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,160
But I won't let my daughter
marry a washerman.

979
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,920
Aren't washerman human beings?

980
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,640
One who mends is a cobbler,

981
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,080
...another who makes
them is a brand.

982
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,760
One who weaves is a weaver,

983
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,200
...another who produces
in bulk is a businessman.

984
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,800
Stop that comparison.
-Bye. -Shut up.

985
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,960
Please listen to me.

986
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,640
I don't want to
listen to anything.

987
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,440
I'd rather kill my daughter
than let her marry you.

988
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,760
Get out of here.

989
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,560
Dad! Madan!

990
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,840
You can't talk to
guests like that.

991
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,720
Let go of him!

992
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,840
Get out of here.

993
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,440
Madan! -Shameless girl!

994
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,160
Did I give you freedom so that
you romance a lowly washerman?

995
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,800
Go upstairs and stay there!

996
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,680
Mr. Accountant, write a letter to Mr.
Sardarilal right away.

997
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,120
I'll get her married to Narendra.
-Okay.

998
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,920
Madan!

999
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,240
Madan!

1000
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,840
Madan!

1001
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,040
Hello, there. How are you?

1002
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,680
Very well.

1003
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,480
Come in and sit down.

1004
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,680
Welcome.

1005
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,640
You've come over
after a long time.

1006
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,440
I came over to drop my laundry.

1007
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,560
Drop your laundry? -Yes.

1008
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,880
Madan is working as a
washerman these days.

1009
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,680
I thought, I'd rather let him do
my laundry than to anyone else.

1010
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,720
Here. Count them.

1011
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,040
Laundry?

1012
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,840
Madan is doing that?

1013
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,080
What are you saying?

1014
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,040
I'm saying that because I saw
him with the other washermen.

1015
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,840
You're behaving as
if you have no clue.

1016
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,320
Are you out of your mind?

1017
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,720
Has any of our ancestors ever
washed clothes for a living?

1018
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,560
Take that away.

1019
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,280
Did you all see that?

1020
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,840
You just can't
wish someone well.

1021
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,320
I thought, it would bring
you some earnings.

1022
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,240
But this man is being so rude.

1023
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,240
Here comes your son. Ask him.

1024
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,200
Have you started
washing clothes?

1025
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,800
Yes, father.

1026
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,520
There!

1027
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,720
You were so confident!

1028
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,160
Where's the harm, father?

1029
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,320
Harm?

1030
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,600
Do you even bother about
our family's reputation?

1031
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,480
Do you want your sister's
engagement to be called off?

1032
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,440
Do you want her to stay
single all her life?

1033
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,680
Do you want our neighbours
to look down upon us?

1034
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,600
But I don't pick pockets or gamble.
-Enough of that nonsense!

1035
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,720
Did you study so
hard to do this?

1036
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,760
Is that why we
mortgaged the house?

1037
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,360
Did we go hungry, so that
you can be a washerman?

1038
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,920
It's because of my education
that I can think broadly.

1039
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,640
We Indians care for our reputation
more than anything else. -Shut up!

1040
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,760
Indians care for reputation!

1041
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,120
You've always spent time
with these lowly people.

1042
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,440
You must've been a devil
in your previous birth.

1043
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,280
It's our bad luck that
you were born to us.

1044
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,720
But father… -Don't
call me father!

1045
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,720
From now on, I
consider you dead.

1046
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,600
Why are you saying that?

1047
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,040
Get out of my house!

1048
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,080
Now!

1049
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,320
If you want to continue
doing this, leave the town…

1050
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,760
so that no can your damned face!

1051
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,400
Son, please don't do that again.

1052
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,840
Mother, please try to understand.
-Are you leaving or not.

1053
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,920
Get out of here. -Father! -Out!

1054
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,240
Brother! -Madan!

1055
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,480
Madan!

1056
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,040
My son! Stop him!

1057
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,320
Someone, stop my son!

1058
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,480
Stop! Let him go!

1059
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,480
Consider your son dead!
-Let go of me!

1060
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,160
You won't know how
a mother feels!

1061
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,800
Age and tough times
have driven you crazy.

1062
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,320
My son! I'll die without him!

1063
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,560
Then go to hell!

1064
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,600
If you don't forget about
him, you'll regret it!

1065
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,760
Mother!

1066
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,000
Madan, what is it?

1067
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,880
Did anyone see you come in? -No.

1068
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,880
I'm sorry for my
father's behaviour.

1069
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,600
Whatever happened
was fair enough.

1070
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,440
Unless a person
proves his worth,

1071
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,680
...the closest of
people turn away.

1072
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,200
My father asked me
to leave the house.

1073
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,960
He asked you to leave!

1074
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:06,880
Yes.

1075
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,520
I'm going away to far-off place.

1076
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,480
I don't know where I'm headed.

1077
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,720
I won't let you go.

1078
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,720
If you must, I'll come along.

1079
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,440
Don't be foolish, Indu.

1080
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,360
You belong to a rich family
and lead a luxurious life.

1081
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,640
You won't be able to tolerate
a moment of the tough life.

1082
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,400
You don't know what
I'm capable of.

1083
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,960
If you're with me, I can
face anything in life.

1084
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,160
Without you, my life
would be meaningless.

1085
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,040
But please try to understand…
-I don't want to do that.

1086
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,240
If you leave without
me, I'll kill myself.

1087
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,720
Indu!

1088
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,160
Indu!

1089
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,600
I didn't know you
loved me so much.

1090
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,080
I was…

1091
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,240
If you're with me, my life
would be so beautiful!

1092
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,440
Madan! -Indu!

1093
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,560
Let's meet at 11.00 p.m.
in the garden.

1094
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,200
I know, that scoundrel was here.

1095
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,960
But I didn't expect you
to be so thoughtless.

1096
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,400
You should've thought about
your family's reputation,

1097
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,520
…before doing something like that!
-Father!

1098
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,280
If you step out of the
house, before your marriage,

1099
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,640
you'll see the worst of me!

1100
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,960
Get back in!

1101
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,400
Father!

1102
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,160
'So, Indu decided not to come.'

1103
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,680
'It was the right decision.'

1104
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,040
'The luxuries of
her father's home'

1105
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,400
'are far better than
the uncertain future.'

1106
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,320
'She would marry an officer.'

1107
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,640
'Why would she choose a beggar?'

1108
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,280
'Love and affection are myths.'

1109
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,840
'It's nice to talk about them
while seated on luxurious sofas.'

1110
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,560
'When it gets dark,

1111
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,720
your own shadow abandons you.'

1112
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,760
'I'm all alone in
this world now.'

1113
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,880
'I must walk alone.'

1114
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,880
I have a long way to go.'

1115
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,440
'It's an unexplored path...'

1116
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,720
'and an unknown destination.'

1117
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,400
I told Mr. Motiram,

1118
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,760
it would be too soon for Mr. Dhaniram
to make arrangements for the wedding.

1119
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,400
What did he say about it?

1120
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,520
What could he say about it?

1121
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,360
His wife insisted on it.

1122
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,680
She said, her son had a job at the
deputy commissioner's office.

1123
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,440
I want him to get married
first and then start his job.

1124
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,520
Sister will get married soon!
-Quiet!

1125
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,200
Sheela, go upstairs.

1126
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,000
You go with her.

1127
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,440
My greetings to the astrologer.
-Greetings to you too, ma' am.

1128
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,480
How are you?

1129
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,760
I'm doing fine.

1130
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,360
Did you ask, if he wants tea?
-I had it, ma' am.

1131
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,040
They want the marriage to
be held within 15 days.

1132
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,320
I don't know how
we'll manage that.

1133
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,720
It's a real wedding,
not a doll's wedding.

1134
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,840
You're right, ma'am.

1135
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,440
But you rarely find
such good boys.

1136
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,880
You know, the groom's family
usually has an upper hand.

1137
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,200
If they call the engagement
off, they have nothing to lose.

1138
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,800
Your reputation is at stake.

1139
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:25,960
Think about it.

1140
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,920
How would it help to think?

1141
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,960
A girl's family is like a
tiny bird in the fist.

1142
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,520
Neither dead, nor alive.

1143
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,760
Tell Mr. Motiram, we're ready.
-Very good!

1144
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,960
That's very good!

1145
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,760
I'll convey your message to him.

1146
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,160
Good bye.

1147
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,640
Good bye, ma'am. -Good bye.

1148
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,000
That's too much!
Why did you agree?

1149
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,920
There's jewellery to be bought,
arrange for gifts and dowry,

1150
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,960
...the marriage ceremony
and food for everyone...

1151
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,840
What could I have said?
We must do something.

1152
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,960
We have nothing that we can spend.
-We'll manage.

1153
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,880
Well, I wanted to say…

1154
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,840
...that I need five thousand rupees.
-Is that it?

1155
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,160
Why do you hesitate?

1156
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,160
When do you want it?

1157
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,720
The wedding is on the 12th
and the preparations are on.

1158
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,600
If you could give it
to me in a day's time…

1159
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,120
A day's time.

1160
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,440
That's a little difficult.

1161
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,440
You probably don't know that
merchants don't have so much money.

1162
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,760
Dhaniram, do as I say.

1163
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,640
For now, borrow the money
from someone else.

1164
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,840
You may return the money, after
I give it to you 15 days later.

1165
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,560
It's okay if you take 10
years to return my money.

1166
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,040
Thanks a lot. You've relieved
me of a great burden.

1167
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,200
Why are you saying that?

1168
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,000
Am I doing you a favour?

1169
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,840
Sheela is like a daughter to me.
-Of course.

1170
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,120
I was only saying

1171
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,560
...that your help at this hour…

1172
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,480
...is something I will never forget.
-It's okay.

1173
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,840
Well, I'll do as you say.

1174
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,320
I'll try to arrange
for the money.

1175
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,640
If God wills, that will be done.

1176
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,520
I don't think, we'll
charge an interest.

1177
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,400
But the problem is that
my boss in in Japan.

1178
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,080
As you know, he looks after
the money-lending business.

1179
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,280
I can't do anything much.

1180
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,160
Okay. Bye.

1181
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,360
You may go.

1182
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,680
The time is over. Please
come back tomorrow.

1183
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,960
It's the last day for paying
taxes, or I'll be fined.

1184
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,600
Okay, give it to me.

1185
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,320
Congratulations, sir. -What for?

1186
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,960
Your daughter is
getting married.

1187
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,280
Let me help you with
the decorations.

1188
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,760
I usually get contracts
for leaders' meetings.

1189
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,800
Okay.

1190
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,080
I'll do that when it's time.

1191
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,880
'Dhaniram, do as I say.'

1192
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,600
'For now, borrow the money
from someone else.'

1193
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,760
'You may return the money, after
I give it to you 15 days later.'

1194
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,560
It's okay if you take 10
years to return my money.

1195
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,840
Indravar. -Who is it?

1196
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,120
Dhaniram.

1197
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,640
What happened?

1198
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,400
There's nothing to say.

1199
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,200
The fact that I'm alive…

1200
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,040
…is a miracle.

1201
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,240
You know…

1202
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,840
…how much it has
rained this year.

1203
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,840
But there was a
storm after that…

1204
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,600
...and timber worth
millions was washed away.

1205
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,960
I've gone bankrupt, Dhaniram!

1206
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,040
Dhaniram.

1207
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,360
Will you ever forgive me?

1208
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,760
What are you saying?

1209
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,520
You asked me for help
for the first time,

1210
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,120
...but destiny had
something else in mind.

1211
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:17,240
I surely can't lend you
five thousand rupees.

1212
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,560
Be strong, Indravar.

1213
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,200
It's not your fault.

1214
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,760
You must get well soon.

1215
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,160
Everything will be fine.

1216
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,480
Don't worry about me.

1217
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,640
Don't worry about me.

1218
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,200
Don't worry about me.

1219
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,240
Sir.

1220
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,680
The boss wants to see you.

1221
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,400
Okay.

1222
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,040
Okay.

1223
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,640
What is this Dhaniram?

1224
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,960
There's five thousand
rupees in the cash box.

1225
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,800
Why haven't you deposited
it in the bank?

1226
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,760
It slipped out of my mind.

1227
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,600
You're a senior officer.
How could you do that?

1228
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,600
Don't you know, it's
people's money?

1229
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,280
Both of us could be
in jail for that.

1230
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,240
The bank must be closed now.

1231
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,280
Deposit the money in the bank
tomorrow and show me the entry.

1232
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,360
Sure.

1233
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,400
'Don't you know, it's
people's money?'

1234
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,240
'Both of us could be
in jail for that.'

1235
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,200
'The bank must be closed now.'

1236
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,520
'Deposit the money in the bank
tomorrow and show me the entry.'

1237
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,840
'Where are you going, Dhaniram?'

1238
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,800
'You can't face anyone
at home as the culprit.'

1239
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,680
'You'll be arrested.'

1240
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,760
'Your house will be auctioned.'

1241
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,240
'People will look
down upon you.'

1242
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:57,680
'Wouldn't it be
worse than death?'

1243
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:28,880
No one knows what God
has planned for us.

1244
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,640
What has happened,
was meant to be.

1245
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,640
Please come with me.

1246
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,400
Uncle, why is mother crying?

1247
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,600
I can't bear to see
you like that.

1248
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,280
Please come with me.

1249
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,040
There's nothing left.

1250
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,840
You don't have your
house anymore.

1251
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,240
The money-lender is wondering
when he can take over.

1252
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:05,480
If not for my sake, you must come
for the sake of this little one.

1253
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,600
Come on! It's lunch break.

1254
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,680
My teacher!

1255
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,440
Master Madan!

1256
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,840
My teacher!

1257
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,120
My teacher, I've
proved my worth.

1258
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,080
My business flourished
in the city.

1259
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,520
I have 20 people working for me.

1260
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,840
Look, what I've got for you.

1261
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,880
I've got gifts for everyone!

1262
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,840
A dress for Munni,
a sari for Sheela,

1263
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:36,520
a shawl for mother and for
father… Wait a minute.

1264
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,920
Look!

1265
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,240
When I left, he had said,
I was good-for-nothing.

1266
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,240
When I show him the
money, he'll be happy.

1267
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,840
I'll place the money at
his feet and tell him…

1268
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,240
I'm here to relieve him
of his responsibilities.

1269
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,560
He may relax now.

1270
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,360
What's the matter, Ram Lakhan?

1271
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,520
Why are you crying?

1272
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,040
Your father isn't
around to see this.

1273
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,600
What do you mean?

1274
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,560
Oh, no!

1275
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,120
No, Ram Lakhan.

1276
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,600
His clothes were found
at the riverbank.

1277
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:15,480
Father!

1278
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,920
Be strong, master.

1279
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:26,440
He did all he could for my sake.

1280
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,400
When it was my turn…

1281
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,400
I'm so unfortunate!

1282
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,480
It's destiny, master.

1283
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,960
Be strong.

1284
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:42,240
If you lose hope, who would look
after your mother and sister?

1285
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,640
You're their only support.

1286
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,040
Get up.

1287
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,160
Let's go home.

1288
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:49,960
Get up.

1289
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,120
Have courage.

1290
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,400
My Lord!

1291
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,480
Munni. Munni…

1292
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:23,880
Madan!

1293
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,400
You're back! -Yes, mother.

1294
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,680
You're back!

1295
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,360
Yes, mom. – Dear.

1296
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,360
Lord, you're great!

1297
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,760
I knew, when I have
the idol back,

1298
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,560
I'll have all my good luck back.

1299
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,240
We have been through
a lot, my son.

1300
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:46,120
Your father…

1301
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,480
I know, mother.

1302
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,680
Ram Lakhan told me about it.

1303
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,400
If it wasn't for his support…

1304
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,680
I would've drowned
myself and Munni.

1305
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,120
Good Lord!

1306
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,720
What are you saying, ma'am?

1307
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:01,960
Thank you, Ram Lakhan.

1308
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,040
We owe you a lot.

1309
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,920
Mother, whatever I have
learnt and earned in life…

1310
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,840
…is because of him.

1311
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,560
Don't worry, mother.

1312
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,040
Your son is back…

1313
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,640
...and he earns very well.

1314
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,360
All your troubles are over.

1315
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,920
'Bhai Dooj' is on the
day after tomorrow.

1316
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,960
I'll see Sheela on that day.

1317
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,760
Mom.

1318
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,320
Brother has got me
a pretty dress!

1319
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,520
Uncle, isn't it pretty?

1320
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,240
It is indeed pretty.

1321
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,000
Master, please freshen up.

1322
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,200
You must be tired.

1323
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,560
Yes. -Come on, son.

1324
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,080
Hey!

1325
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,200
Is that you, brother?

1326
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:42,840
Brother!

1327
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,240
Sheela, how did you
guess it was me?

1328
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,080
Why wouldn't I?

1329
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,840
Who else has hands
as hard as stone.

1330
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:53,160
I see! Does my brother-in-law
have soft hands? -Oh, come on!

1331
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,720
How is my brother-in-law?

1332
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,120
Is he nice?

1333
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:58,960
He is in office.

1334
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:01,600
I'm not in a hurry, either.
I'll see him in the evening.

1335
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,680
My left eye had been
twitching since morning.

1336
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:07,240
I knew it was a good omen.

1337
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,080
What's the good news?

1338
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,880
I met you on 'Bhai Dooj'.

1339
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,920
Isn't that good news enough?

1340
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,600
I'll get the vermilion.
-Yes, get it.

1341
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:18,960
I remember…

1342
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,960
dad's scolding would hurt me.

1343
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,160
But today, I really
want to hear it again.

1344
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,320
You would know what happened.

1345
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:37,960
Sheela…

1346
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,240
do they treat you well?

1347
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,040
They're all so nice.

1348
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,240
But I blame myself.
If it wasn't for me,

1349
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,480
why would father do that?

1350
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,680
Sheela, it's my fault.

1351
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:53,880
I couldn't perform
my duties as a son…

1352
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,840
…nor as a brother. -Brother!

1353
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,600
Don't say that.

1354
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,360
I'm sure you'll be
successful someday.

1355
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,200
I pray to God,

1356
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:09,840
...that he should bless
my brother a long life.

1357
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,320
He should be successful
and do so well in life…

1358
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,760
...that he should be a star!

1359
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,800
Sheela, what are you doing?

1360
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:19,120
Who let him in?

1361
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,720
You know, what your
family is known for.

1362
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,880
I have told you a thousand
times… if you want to live here,

1363
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,800
...you must consider
your family dead.

1364
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,400
Mother! At least today,
you shouldn't say that.

1365
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,120
My brother has come
back after a long time.

1366
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,760
Don't insult him.

1367
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,760
Those who are bothered
about their reputation...

1368
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,560
…don't become washermen.

1369
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,280
They don't steal money. -Mother!

1370
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,840
Brother! -Why are
you shouting at me?

1371
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,080
We've let your sister live here.

1372
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,360
Isn't that enough?

1373
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:49,680
Are you here to remind us that
we're related to someone like you?

1374
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:52,400
Mother, my family's reputation…
-To hell with the reputation.

1375
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,480
If you're bothered about
that, just get out of here.

1376
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:00,560
Brother!

1377
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:04,400
I can't take it anymore.

1378
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:09,600
If you feel sorry for your
brother, you may go away with him.

1379
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,960
If you must stay here, you must
forget about them forever.

1380
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:15,520
Brother!

1381
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,640
Sheela, mother is right.

1382
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,720
You're my sister,

1383
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,080
...but you're their
daughter-in-law.

1384
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,680
Go back in.

1385
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:26,360
Go.

1386
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,320
Mother, please forgive Sheela.

1387
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,040
She is innocent.

1388
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:40,680
It's my fault that I came over.

1389
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,280
Son, did you meet your sister?
-Yes, mother.

1390
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:00,240
How is my girl doing?

1391
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,760
She is very happy.
-Really? -Yes.

1392
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,960
Her parents-in-law
are very nice.

1393
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,040
They treated me very well.

1394
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,400
Thank you, God.

1395
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,760
At least my daughter is happy.

1396
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,560
We're blessed to
have such in-laws.

1397
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,240
You're right, mother.

1398
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,840
You have to be fortunate
to find people like these.

1399
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,880
Madan, I still find it
hard to believe that…

1400
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,640
...a loyal employee
like Dhaniram,

1401
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:36,400
...who never made even a small
mistake in keeping accounts…

1402
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,280
...could take five
thousand rupees.

1403
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:44,120
Probably, something happened
on the way to the bank.

1404
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,000
We don't know what happened.

1405
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,440
Only God knows about it.

1406
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,120
All I know is that…

1407
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,400
it's people's money.

1408
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,600
That's why I'm returning it.

1409
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:01,720
My late father's reputation
shouldn't be tainted.

1410
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,040
I wish he was still alive.

1411
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:08,600
A father, who has
a son like you…

1412
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,040
…can't be dead. He will live on.

1413
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,280
I'll take your leave. -Okay.

1414
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,640
So, Mr. Vilayatiram.

1415
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:28,520
What brings you here?

1416
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,320
Do you know, Diwan Kulwant Rai?

1417
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,760
It's his daughter's wedding.

1418
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,760
I'm here to attend it.

1419
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,680
Okay. Carry on. -Bye.

1420
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:53,000
Brother! -Sit down.

1421
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,440
Mother, please get ready.

1422
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,200
We'll take the bus
in the evening.

1423
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,680
Today? -Yes, mother.

1424
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,720
Ram Lakhan, you should
also get ready.

1425
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,080
Where's the hurry, master?

1426
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:04,960
We must hurry up.

1427
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:08,360
I can't live here any longer.

1428
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:13,640
All the lanes and markets,
that I loved walking about…

1429
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,040
…seem so hostile now.

1430
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,040
And then…

1431
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,640
I've to get back to work.

1432
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:25,240
You're right, son.

1433
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,880
I'll get ready soon.

1434
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,560
Then, I'll return the clothes
without washing them.

1435
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:33,360
Jamunia. -What is it?

1436
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,920
Pack up all our stuff.

1437
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:36,320
We're leaving in the evening.

1438
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,400
I'll come back and help.

1439
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,920
Come on, Munni.

1440
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,480
Uncle, did you inform
the music band?

1441
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,960
Yes, they've arrived. -Okay.

1442
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,600
Ram Lakhan, how are you doing?

1443
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,760
I came to congratulate you.

1444
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,200
I'm going to Bombay
in the evening.

1445
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:56,880
Bombay? -Yes, sir.

1446
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:58,200
I found a job there.

1447
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,000
You could've left
a few days later.

1448
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:02,080
This was a good opportunity
to make some quick money.

1449
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,880
I'm helpless sir.

1450
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,160
I would've never returned your
clothes on such an occasion.

1451
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,880
Okay. Here you are.

1452
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,480
May God bless you. -Sir!

1453
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,280
The procession just
heard that I'm coming.

1454
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,160
What did you say?

1455
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,200
You're coming?

1456
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,640
I've been here for so long. The
procession is almost here.

1457
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,520
Okay. Now take the clothes in.

1458
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,800
Come on.

1459
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,880
Where's your daughter?

1460
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,600
I'll give her my blessings.

1461
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,120
She is in her room upstairs.

1462
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,920
What are you doing there?

1463
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,200
Get those things quickly.

1464
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,480
Be right there.

1465
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:37,040
How are you dear?
-Welcome, Ram Lakhan.

1466
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,480
I'm going to Bombay, so, I
came over to bless you.

1467
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:43,640
Bombay? -Yes.

1468
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:47,040
Mr. Dhaniram's son,
Madan… -Madan?

1469
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,400
He is living with me right now.

1470
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,600
He has started his own
business in Mumbai.

1471
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,440
We're all leaving
in the evening.

1472
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:55,760
This evening?

1473
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,240
Yes. We're taking the bus
that leaves at 6.30 p.m.

1474
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,440
May you have a long life, dear.

1475
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,000
Have a happy married life.

1476
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,840
I'll always pray for you.

1477
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,280
The procession is here.
Let's take a look.

1478
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,160
Let me take a look.

1479
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:20,880
Why are you so eager? Is it
your marriage procession?

1480
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,080
You're always poking fun at me!

1481
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:28,240
'He'll always think,
I betrayed him.'

1482
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,520
'Time is passing by.'

1483
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:50,280
'If I don't gather courage,
I'll regret it all my life.'

1484
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:19,600
Doctor…

1485
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,280
There are two fractures
in the same bone.

1486
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,360
That will be set right.

1487
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,200
But the main concern is…

1488
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:31,080
...she isn't responding to
the hammering on her knees.

1489
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,320
What do you mean?

1490
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:37,160
It seems, the shock has rendered
both her legs without sensation.

1491
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,520
We'll try our best.

1492
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,960
She may recover soon.

1493
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,160
Son…

1494
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,480
Yes, uncle.

1495
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,960
Narendra is waiting outside.

1496
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,280
Narendra is here?

1497
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:00,200
I can't face him, uncle.

1498
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,600
This girl has put us to shame.

1499
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:06,880
You may let him come in.

1500
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:09,440
But I'll step out first.

1501
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,800
I'm very sorry…

1502
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,960
that you're in such a condition.

1503
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,080
But…

1504
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,840
...you can't be blamed for that.

1505
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:37,320
Instead…

1506
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:40,720
I have caused you trouble.

1507
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,600
This wasn't intentional.

1508
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,160
If I had an idea,

1509
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,680
I'd never let that happy.

1510
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,600
I wish, we could've met…

1511
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,960
and I could've
told you about it.

1512
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,760
Nothing in life is
as great as love.

1513
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,680
I'd consider myself lucky,

1514
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:03,800
...if I could help
bring lovers together.

1515
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,280
Narendra…

1516
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,920
...there was a time when I…

1517
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,360
...could be a part of his
happy and sad moments.

1518
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,760
I could've been a
part of his life.

1519
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:20,920
But now,

1520
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:25,120
I can hardly carry
myself around.

1521
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,320
How can I face him

1522
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,600
...in the condition that I am?

1523
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,880
I'll be a burden to him.

1524
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,640
Don't lose hope.

1525
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,320
I truly believe,
you'll soon recover.

1526
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:44,640
God won't let someone like you
be in trouble for too long.

1527
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:48,320
If I could be of any help,

1528
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,320
I'd be more than glad.

1529
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,120
Narendra…

1530
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,240
We couldn't be life partners.

1531
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,240
But we can be friends.

1532
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,040
Madan, how are you doing?

1533
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,480
Welcome, Mr Popatlal.

1534
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,560
How are you? -Very well.

1535
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,280
Will you have lunch?
-I've had it.

1536
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,600
Okay, then. Let's go.

1537
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:28,400
What about my order?

1538
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,640
We have 6000 yards
of fabric ready.

1539
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,520
What about the remaining 9000?

1540
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,280
I wanted to talk
to you about it.

1541
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:39,160
Imported dyes are not available
because of Government's policies.

1542
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:42,440
Whatever was available, is
not yet out in the market.

1543
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:44,360
Traders are waiting to
sell them in black. -Then?

1544
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,680
If you don't mind, we'll
use the local… -Oh, no!

1545
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:49,560
I won't accept local dyes.

1546
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,400
My order is an old one.

1547
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:52,400
I want exactly that.

1548
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,480
If we insist on imported stuff,

1549
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:57,960
...how would our local
manufacturers prosper?

1550
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:00,400
I'm not here to listen to
speeches on patriotism.

1551
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,120
I've heard enough of them
before the independence.

1552
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:06,040
If the dyes are available in black,
you must buy them. -No, sir.

1553
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,280
Buying in black is
against my principles.

1554
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:09,800
Then I shall cancel my order.

1555
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,840
Sir! -You and your principles!

1556
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:14,520
Listen to me, sir. -It's
either principles or business.

1557
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:16,600
Return all the fabric.
-Please have mercy, sir.

1558
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,320
We've refused small orders because
we had a huge one from you.

1559
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,840
It's a small workshop.

1560
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,320
Our earnings matter a lot.

1561
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,200
If you cancel, we'll
suffer a huge loss.

1562
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:25,720
Isn't it a loss for me?

1563
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,520
Return my fabric by evening.

1564
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,160
I can't wait any longer.

1565
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,040
Sir! -Let him go, Madan.
We're with you.

1566
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,760
Of course!

1567
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,320
God takes care of
us, not this man.

1568
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,000
Sheela! -Brother!

1569
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:11,640
How are you?

1570
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,280
Calm down.

1571
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,560
Are you excited?

1572
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,600
She is married and a mother now.

1573
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,360
Do you still think
she's a child?

1574
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:24,240
Even when she's a grandma,
she'll be little sister.

1575
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,760
Oh, my dear Madan!

1576
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:30,200
Mother!

1577
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:35,480
Greetings, mother. -May
you have a long life.

1578
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,800
May God bless you
with happiness.

1579
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,200
My scolding worked wonders.

1580
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,400
Had I not scolded you,

1581
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,240
...would you have
been so successful?

1582
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,760
Scold me once more.
I'll be a millionaire.

1583
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:51,760
You should swear at me from
the bottom of your heart.

1584
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,000
If it was someone else,
he'd take it to heart.

1585
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,240
You may ask her.

1586
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:03,440
I praised you after
you had left.

1587
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:05,960
That was too quick.

1588
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:07,880
People usually do that
after someone's dead.

1589
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:10,040
Don't say that, son.

1590
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,800
All of us have our
hopes pinned on you.

1591
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,880
May you live to be a hundred.

1592
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:15,840
May you have a few
years of my life too.

1593
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:18,680
Don't say that. If that happens,

1594
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,400
...whom will I take care of?

1595
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,800
Your son is such a darling!

1596
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:25,000
Look at my son, your son-in-law.

1597
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,320
He's stone-hearted.
-Don't say that mother.

1598
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:28,640
Why not?

1599
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:31,000
He's completely useless.

1600
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:32,880
Oh, no! Why are you saying that?

1601
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,720
There's a reason I say that.

1602
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,920
Son, please help
him settle down.

1603
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,240
Find a job for him.

1604
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,840
Oh, no! I'm a washerman.

1605
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:44,520
He will do anything you ask him.

1606
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:49,840
Farming, small business, or clerical job.
-Will you shut up?

1607
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,760
Let's have dinner. It's ready.
-Okay.

1608
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:56,440
I'll have dinner
and be right back.

1609
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,480
What's for dinner? -It's
a sumptuous fare.

1610
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:00,360
Take a look yourself.

1611
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,440
Okay. -Let's go.

1612
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,800
Come on.

1613
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:10,400
She talks too much.

1614
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,680
Brother.

1615
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,200
Did you see the baby?

1616
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:19,560
So, baby!

1617
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:22,360
What took you so long to
come and see your uncle?

1618
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,720
Brother, sis told me…

1619
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:28,520
...she bought a baby, when she went
shopping for vegetables. -Shut up.

1620
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,360
Why should I?

1621
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:32,600
Brother, why don't you
go to the market?

1622
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,400
Quiet!

1623
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,840
Brother, what are you doing?

1624
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,120
I'm making a picture of you.

1625
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:45,240
Why did you move?

1626
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,960
I was wondering what
you were up to.

1627
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:49,160
Let me see.

1628
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,800
Who is this? -It's the Lord.

1629
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,120
Is it so? -Yes.

1630
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,520
If that's God, this
one's a ghost.

1631
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,480
It's not a ghost, it's you.

1632
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:05,160
Don't you recognise yourself?

1633
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,720
Is that me? -Yes.

1634
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:07,360
I see.

1635
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:10,120
Who is this? -Your wife.

1636
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:11,880
What? -Your wife.

1637
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,960
It's your wife.

1638
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,040
Naughty girl.

1639
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:59,200
What are you thinking about?

1640
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,200
Nothing at all.

1641
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:05,160
Since I've come here, I've noticed…
you get lost, while you're talking.

1642
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:09,080
We have everything
now, except for one.

1643
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,960
Brother, you must
find a life partner.

1644
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,120
A life partner?

1645
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:15,520
Yes. Who else would be with you?

1646
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:19,040
Who will marry me?

1647
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,640
Why? What about Indu? -Sheela!

1648
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,240
Don't mention her again.

1649
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:31,120
Why not? I quite like her…

1650
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:32,280
...and mom too.

1651
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:34,960
She came to see us
after you had left.

1652
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,240
I could tell she
loved you dearly.

1653
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:40,600
Loved me?

1654
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:42,680
Love.

1655
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:46,360
When someone's at a
crossroad in life...

1656
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,480
...where one road leads to love,

1657
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,480
...and the other, to wealth…

1658
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,360
...the path of wealth
is the only way to go.

1659
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:56,280
She got married a year ago.

1660
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,440
She must be revelling
in luxuries.

1661
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,120
What happened?

1662
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,960
Did you break something again?

1663
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:08,800
I've told you to ask for
help, if you need something.

1664
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:12,960
Why don't you accept
that you're handicapped?

1665
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:15,960
You're a burden for
yourself and everyone else.

1666
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:19,040
That's what girls
like you deserve.

1667
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,440
Uncle, what about the men,
to be hired on daily wages?

1668
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:03,360
There, Gattu will handle them.

1669
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,880
Don't worry.

1670
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,000
Okay.

1671
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:08,160
What's your name? -Dinanath.

1672
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,440
I'm well-versed with
dyeing and printing.

1673
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:11,760
Sure? -Yes, sir.

1674
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:12,840
Thank you, sir.

1675
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,480
What's your name?

1676
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:15,520
Gopal.

1677
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,480
Will you be able to
do physical labour?

1678
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,200
Yes. I'll do whatever you say.

1679
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:21,600
You may go in.

1680
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,080
Be careful.

1681
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,120
Enough. -Please take some more.

1682
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,680
We've had a hearty meal.

1683
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:48,920
We'll pray for the peace
of your ancestors' souls.

1684
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,160
Sher Singh. -Yes, ma'am.

1685
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:56,960
Distribute these sweets
among the workers.

1686
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:57,840
Sure, ma'am.

1687
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,640
Munni, what are you doing?

1688
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:03,240
Don't wake the baby up.

1689
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:05,520
Go with Sher Singh.

1690
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:07,160
Distribute sweets among workers.

1691
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:18,680
Take this.

1692
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:21,720
Cute kitty, how many rats
have you had since morning?

1693
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,640
One less than you have.
-Very good!

1694
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:26,360
Take this.

1695
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:29,720
Munni when are you
getting married?

1696
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:30,840
Very soon.

1697
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,040
Why are you worried?

1698
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,040
Take some sweets, sir.

1699
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:40,880
Munni.

1700
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:43,400
Take it.

1701
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,800
Munni. -Let go of me!

1702
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,800
Munni!

1703
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:01,040
That girl… -The younger
sister of our master.

1704
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:02,800
Master? -Yes.

1705
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:04,760
His name is Madan. -Madan?

1706
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:11,440
He's the owner!

1707
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,880
He is a big man!

1708
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,400
My son!

1709
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:20,760
Madan.

1710
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:28,320
Do you want to see Madan sir?
-Yes.

1711
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:29,680
He isn't here. -Where is he?

1712
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:30,360
At home.

1713
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,680
It's his father's
death anniversary.

1714
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,200
Death anniversary?

1715
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,120
Right.

1716
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:48,840
His father is dead.

1717
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,520
His father died long ago.

1718
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:00,080
'How can I face them?'

1719
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:06,280
'Your sins mustn't
overshadow their happiness.'

1720
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:11,040
'I'm in an abyss of anonymity.'

1721
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,840
'That's where I deserve to be.'

1722
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:24,840
Brother, I'll make him laugh.
-You can't do this. Come to me.

1723
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,960
He'll laugh and his father too.

1724
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:31,160
Brother. – Yes.

1725
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,600
Is everything okay,
uncle Ram Lakhan?

1726
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,400
I heard, you fought
with your wife again.

1727
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,640
She picks up fights.

1728
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,400
She watches movies every day.

1729
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:09,920
Let her. Where's the problem?

1730
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:11,760
You know, how things
are in the city.

1731
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:13,840
Who is absent? -Gopal.

1732
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:15,520
He is old and sick.

1733
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:18,280
We have to deliver by evening.

1734
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:19,400
How do we manage this?

1735
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:21,240
Don't worry. I'll do his job.

1736
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,720
No! -Let me do it.

1737
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,960
I've lost touch and I have time.

1738
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:32,720
Wash off all the
stains on your mind!

1739
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,760
Tell the accountants, not
to deduct Gopal's salary.

1740
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,400
He is unwell. -Okay, master.

1741
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:42,040
Wash off all the
stains on your mind!

1742
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:43,240
Mr. Madan. -Yes.

1743
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:45,720
The new welfare officer is here.
-Let him wait in the office.

1744
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:46,440
Okay.

1745
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:50,480
Wash off all the
stains on your mind!

1746
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,680
Wash off all the
stains on your mind!

1747
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:59,960
Wash off all the
stains on your mind!

1748
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,040
I'm sorry.

1749
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:02,120
No problem.

1750
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,520
That happens when
you're working.

1751
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:06,800
So, do you get your
salary on time?

1752
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:07,600
What?

1753
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,200
Yes, I get it on time.

1754
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:10,480
How many members in your family?

1755
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:13,320
Two people besides me.
My mother and sister.

1756
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:15,960
Have you saved up for
your sister's wedding?

1757
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,960
She's quite young.

1758
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,200
Young. -What about you?

1759
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:21,360
Any problems?

1760
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:24,360
Not at all. No problem.

1761
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,320
The owner must be around.

1762
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,720
I've been trying to tell you…

1763
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:32,880
Mr. Madan, he's the
new welfare officer.

1764
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,840
That's our managing director.

1765
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:38,320
You? -Yes.

1766
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:41,280
Don't I look like one?

1767
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,560
Actually, I'm one of them.

1768
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:46,520
It's so nice to see you.

1769
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:48,800
Please come along.

1770
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:51,320
Come in.

1771
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:56,280
It's surprising to see you
working with the labourers.

1772
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:58,440
There's an order
that goes out today.

1773
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:00,080
I had nothing else to do.

1774
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:04,680
The labourer got his daily
wages and our work got done.

1775
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:05,640
Sit down.

1776
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,480
This isn't something ordinary.

1777
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:11,720
Such things make
the labourer proud

1778
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,400
and they work very hard.

1779
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:15,520
They progress in life,
so, does their master...

1780
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,160
and in turn, the country.

1781
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:22,040
I also saw the arrangements you
have for their entertainment.

1782
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,680
Congratulations for that.
-Thank you.

1783
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:28,840
I'll be really grateful, if you can
inaugurate the facility for us.

1784
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:32,360
Sure. I'll do that gladly.

1785
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:34,480
Some tea.

1786
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,840
My friends,

1787
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,280
it's a great honour for us…

1788
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,840
that our Labour Welfare Officer,

1789
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:58,760
Mr. Narendra Kumar
is present with us.

1790
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,320
All of you have worked hard...

1791
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:03,800
...to build this
entertainment centre.

1792
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,360
And he will be inaugurating it.

1793
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:13,640
Whatever I have observed during
my brief meeting with Mr. Kumar,

1794
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:15,800
I can say that

1795
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:21,120
...he is not only compassionate
towards labourers and workers,

1796
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:25,680
but also, patriotic
and a humanitarian.

1797
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:30,520
I'd request him to
say a few words.

1798
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:40,520
Friends, it's not these kind
words from Mr. Madanlal…

1799
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:42,760
...that make me obliged
to praise him.

1800
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:46,040
The unique relationship he
shares with his labourers…

1801
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,360
that Mr. Madanlal has
formed and is living up to…

1802
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:50,920
...is an example for business
owners all over the country.

1803
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:53,800
This beautiful relationship
that he has formed…

1804
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:56,560
...will help us progress… will
help our country to progress.

1805
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,720
As I inaugurate the hall, I'd
like to present the decision…

1806
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:08,200
...that the labour committee
has just presented to me.

1807
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:14,680
All the labourers wanted to
name the hall after the person…

1808
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,280
…whom they're always proud of.

1809
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:18,880
That is why,

1810
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:22,960
everyone has decided
to name the hall…

1811
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,640
Dhaniram Hall.

1812
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:38,800
I congratulate everyone for
this wonderful decision.

1813
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:41,920
By immortalising the memory of
the late father of Mr. Madanlal,

1814
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:46,480
...all of you have proven, the roots
are more important than the fruit.

1815
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:51,640
I appreciate the father, who
acknowledged his son's calling…

1816
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:53,800
...and gave him the freedom
to make his own choices.

1817
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:59,240
Mr. Dhaniram could've had his son
working as an officer or clerk.

1818
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:02,920
But he let his son
choose the path…

1819
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:07,720
...which was uneven, thorny and
demanded blood, sweat and tears.

1820
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:13,800
It was Mr. Dhaniram, who wiped
off the feeling of inferiority,

1821
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:17,520
...related to jobs that
require physical labour.

1822
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:19,720
That's because he was sure,

1823
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:25,240
...that in today's day and age, a
farmer, who toils in his field…

1824
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:27,240
...or a worker, who
works in a mill...

1825
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:31,040
...put in as much effort as a clerk
or an officer, with a desk job.

1826
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,880
Finally, I'd like to pray that
each young man in our country…

1827
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:42,640
…should be blessed with
a father like Dhaniram…

1828
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:46,760
...so that the country
progresses at a rapid pace.

1829
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:01,000
Friends,

1830
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:06,080
I don't know what to say.

1831
02:14:09,160 --> 02:14:09,960
Today,

1832
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,400
when I came in…

1833
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:15,680
I didn't know…

1834
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:19,200
...that you'd name the
entertainment hall…

1835
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:24,320
...after my honourable,
late father.

1836
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,480
I didn't know,

1837
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:31,480
...this was his portrait.

1838
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:37,160
I had no idea,

1839
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:41,680
...you love for me
was so tremendous…

1840
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:45,200
…and I have no words to express…

1841
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:48,360
What can…

1842
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:52,440
a son say about his father.

1843
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:56,440
He's the father.

1844
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:01,160
And there's nothing
more that I can say.

1845
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:07,640
My father worked
hard all his life.

1846
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:10,920
He worked so hard…

1847
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:13,320
that it affected his health.

1848
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:19,160
Whatever I have learnt today,

1849
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:22,920
is thanks to the teachings...

1850
02:15:23,720 --> 02:15:24,880
…given by him.

1851
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:27,760
He sacrificed his entire life

1852
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,440
to make sure we led good lives.

1853
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:34,120
I wish…

1854
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:36,440
my tired, old father...

1855
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:38,960
could've witnessed this.

1856
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:50,920
You have honoured my father.

1857
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,760
I feel honoured.

1858
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:58,440
I'd like to thank our
honourable chairperson…

1859
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,360
...and all of you.

1860
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:11,600
Lakhoba…

1861
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:13,680
What Mr. Narendra said was
exactly opposite of the truth.

1862
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,560
What is it? -We can't say that

1863
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:17,240
...each son should
have such a father.

1864
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,400
But we can say that each
father should have such a son.

1865
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:22,960
Come on.

1866
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:36,320
'Get out of my house!'

1867
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:39,400
'If you want to continue
doing this, leave the town…'

1868
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:41,120
'so that no can
your damned face!'

1869
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:46,880
'I appreciate the father, who
acknowledged his son's calling…'

1870
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:49,240
'and gave him the freedom
to make his own choices.'

1871
02:16:58,880 --> 02:16:59,800
'Lakhoba…'

1872
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:02,760
'What Mr. Narendra said was
exactly opposite of the truth.'

1873
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:04,840
'What is it? -We can't say that

1874
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,200
...each son should
have such a father.'

1875
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:09,920
'But we can say that each
father should have such a son.'

1876
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:31,560
Hey!

1877
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:37,600
Gopal.

1878
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,400
Why are you here at this hour?

1879
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:42,480
I'm…

1880
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:45,880
You know, you aren't allowed
to come here at night.

1881
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:47,600
Go home and get some sleep.

1882
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:50,440
Okay.

1883
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:07,920
Your father is at the doctor's
to get your examination report.

1884
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:09,160
He'll come back later.

1885
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:13,360
From what the doctor said, it
seems that you'll recover soon.

1886
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,440
Thank you.

1887
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,040
We're indebted to you.

1888
02:19:16,440 --> 02:19:17,640
How can we ever repay that?

1889
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:20,520
If you say that again, I'll leave.
-Mr. Narendra!

1890
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:22,840
I'm actually leaving for work.

1891
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:25,280
If you need something, please
tell the servant. -Sure.

1892
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:26,320
I'll take your leave.

1893
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,240
Mother, I've been
invited for tea.

1894
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:32,240
You're always busy.

1895
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:34,640
When can I have a word with you?

1896
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:37,960
My dear mother, I'm
never too busy for you.

1897
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:39,800
What is it? -Go away.

1898
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:43,600
By God's grace we have everything,
but I feel so lonely.

1899
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:45,480
The house seems empty.

1900
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:47,360
The house seems empty. -Yes.

1901
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:48,680
What do we do about it?

1902
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:51,240
I'll take you for a pilgrimage.

1903
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:56,040
I'll feel blessed only when
I see my daughter-in-law.

1904
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:59,240
Mother, I've told you not to
mention about my marriage.

1905
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:04,960
But Madan, listen to me. -I
said, I don't want to marry.

1906
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:20,640
Is Mr. Narendra home?
-No, he's not.

1907
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:22,000
He'll be back in a bit.

1908
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,960
He has asked you to wait. -Okay.

1909
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:05,320
It's you!

1910
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:09,560
Madan!

1911
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,800
Why are you here?

1912
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:17,800
I see.

1913
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:21,840
So, the welfare officer was Mr.
Narendra.

1914
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:28,280
I'm sorry, I couldn't
congratulate you on the wedding.

1915
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,080
How could I?

1916
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:32,040
I never had the chance.

1917
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:35,240
Anyway, it's not too late yet.

1918
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:37,360
Congratulations.

1919
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:41,480
I wanted to apologise as well.

1920
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:45,320
I couldn't make it that night.

1921
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,640
Then? -I'm sorry about it.

1922
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:53,760
You must've left home with
a lot of dreams and hopes.

1923
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:56,960
You're a woman and you
were out at midnight.

1924
02:21:58,040 --> 02:21:59,120
It was also raining.

1925
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:06,560
You must've waited for me all
wet and shivering in the rain.

1926
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:10,320
The clock must've struck one.

1927
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:11,840
Then two.

1928
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:13,440
Then three.

1929
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:14,880
Four.

1930
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:19,080
Finally, you must've
left while cursing me.

1931
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:22,800
How can I explain?
-Where's the need?

1932
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:24,520
You were right.

1933
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:27,040
What did I have to offer?

1934
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:28,840
Only love.

1935
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,960
You can't eat it or wear it.

1936
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:35,480
You're used to good
food and clothing.

1937
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:38,320
It's all about being used to.

1938
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:42,480
For example, I can't sleep
on soft and cosy beds.

1939
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:44,880
Please don't say that. -Shut up!

1940
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:46,880
I know you're someone
else's wife.

1941
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,520
I have no right to talk to you.

1942
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,440
But, can I not express?

1943
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:53,280
I've suppressed my
pain for years.

1944
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:54,800
Can I not tell you about it?

1945
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:57,520
The wounds have left scars.

1946
02:22:57,880 --> 02:22:59,440
Can I not try healing them?

1947
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:01,600
I thought, the story was over.

1948
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:04,280
But I didn't know,
you'd drag it here.

1949
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:07,080
Madan! -I can't bear
crocodile's tears.

1950
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,960
I don't want you
to fool me again.

1951
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:11,680
I don't want you to
have fun at my expense.

1952
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:14,800
I have progressed
tremendously in life,

1953
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:17,640
...but I couldn't tread
the path of love.

1954
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:19,320
I lost my feet.

1955
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:22,920
Mr. Madan, I heard it all.

1956
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:26,960
Before you accuse this poor
girl for betraying you,

1957
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:28,240
...did you ever think,

1958
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:32,200
...her father could've stopped
her, when she was coming to you?

1959
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:37,360
Did you ever think, she
would've tried to look for you?

1960
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:38,840
It's a lie.

1961
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:41,080
If that was true,
she'd wait for me.

1962
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:42,400
She would've never
married anyone.

1963
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:44,960
Whose marriage are
you talking about?

1964
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:46,840
Narendra! -Madan…

1965
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:50,480
Indu was always yours
and will always be.

1966
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:52,440
Did you ever think,

1967
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:55,840
...why Indu never get up even
after seeing you in front of her?

1968
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:59,400
You said, you lost your
feet on the path of love.

1969
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:02,240
Did you see, it wasn't you?

1970
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:05,040
It was actually her.

1971
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:07,640
She tried to catch up with you,
while in her wedding dress.

1972
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,560
Indu, why didn't you tell me?

1973
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,800
Because, she loves you
more than herself.

1974
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:29,240
It was her love that forbade her
from being a burden to you.

1975
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:32,720
It's a coincidence that she
came over for her treatment…

1976
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,920
…and destiny brought the
two of you face to face.

1977
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,960
Probably, she would've gone away

1978
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,960
...and you'd never meet her.

1979
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:48,920
Indu…

1980
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:52,040
...why did you think
I'd be so heartless?

1981
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,560
Do flowers make a burden?

1982
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:58,560
Madan! -Indu!

1983
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:02,560
I never thought you'd accept me…

1984
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,840
...and give me a
place in your heart.

1985
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:08,200
I won't ever let you go away.

1986
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:12,120
Indu…

1987
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:15,040
I had everything in life,

1988
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:17,240
...but without you,

1989
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:19,120
...it all seemed incomplete…

1990
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,880
...so useless.

1991
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:26,760
Madan! -Indu!

1992
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:51,160
Silence! Quiet!

1993
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:53,680
What's the matter?
What is going on?

1994
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:57,960
Mr. Madan, Gopal tore your
father's portrait. -What?

1995
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:00,760
Tore the portrait?

1996
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,280
Why? -No idea.

1997
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:05,360
He was wandering
there last night.

1998
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:07,760
He was staring at the portrait.

1999
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:12,200
Gopal,

2000
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:14,680
...has my father
ever wronged you?

2001
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:18,040
A workshop is the labourers'
place of worship.

2002
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:21,440
Having that portrait is like
humiliating the labourers.

2003
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:24,040
Why do you say that?

2004
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:25,760
Because, I know Dhaniram.

2005
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:27,000
What do you know about him?

2006
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:30,200
He worked as a clerk
all his life.

2007
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:32,480
He was vain.

2008
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:36,880
He always thought, white
collar jobs were the best.

2009
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:39,040
When his son tried
to labour hard...

2010
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:42,720
...and earn a living
by honest means,

2011
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:44,760
...he got rid of him.
-What nonsense is that?

2012
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,240
For the sake of his pride…

2013
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:49,320
…he laundered five thousand rupees
to marry his daughter off. -Gopal!

2014
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:52,160
He was unfaithful, a thief!
-Stop that nonsense!

2015
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,800
That's my prize.

2016
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:02,040
I don't deserve what
you gave me yesterday.

2017
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:05,960
What?

2018
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:19,160
Father! -Master!

2019
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:20,400
Father!

2020
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:21,880
Let go of me!

2021
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:24,320
Your father's dead. -No, father.

2022
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:27,040
Where had you been, father?

2023
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,600
Why did you leave us?

2024
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:29,920
Why did you put
yourself through that?

2025
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,160
Why did you put us through that?

2026
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:32,680
Don't call me your father.

2027
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,640
I've made some
terrible mistakes.

2028
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:39,360
Ram Lakhan, take father home.

2029
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:40,640
I'll get mother.

2030
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:41,720
Let's go.

2031
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:48,200
Mother, it's a miracle!

2032
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:50,280
What happened? -It's
incredibly miraculous!

2033
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:52,400
What has happened?
-Father is alive!

2034
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:54,800
Yes, mother. He's is alive!

2035
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:56,040
Yes!

2036
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:59,960
What are you saying? -That's right.
Father's alive.

2037
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:01,160
We're so lucky.

2038
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:03,400
He was a labourer
in the workshop.

2039
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:07,840
Where is he? -Come with me.

2040
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:13,200
I can't walk.

2041
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:17,760
There he comes.

2042
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,560
You're…

2043
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:30,800
I've given you a lot of pain.

2044
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:33,920
Forgive me. -Oh, no!

2045
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,640
Don't say that.

2046
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:39,720
You're back.

2047
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:42,120
I feel so blessed.

2048
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:44,680
So blessed!

2049
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:51,320
Mr. Dhaniram, we must say…

2050
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:55,600
...both hard work and love
have won the race of life.

2051
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:57,880
May God bless you, dear.

2052
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:00,120
You were meant to be
my daughter-in-law.

2053
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:01,840
Congratulations to you all.

2054
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:04,960
The doctor has said, in a week, Indu
will start walking and running.

2055
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:06,080
What? -That's right.

2056
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:10,280
But I won't let her run away.

2057
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,560
Right?
