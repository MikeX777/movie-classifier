Verona, have some wine!

21
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm cold.

22
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
Come and dance, my bride

23
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,400
you'll soon warm up!

Wolves! The message is clear.

26
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,640
A beautiful cake,
too pretty to eat.

27
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,920
I'll cut some,
may your life be as sweet!

28
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,720
The wolves are here!

29
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,600
Holy mother of God!

30
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,840
Get the guns!

31
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,960
They're all drunk!

32
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
Goran, here's your cake.

33
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,200
Only two, thank God.

34
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,680
The winter was long
and they're hungry!

35
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,400
They've lost all fear.
Hurry! It'll be dark soon.

36
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Hurry up, innkeeper!

37
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,040
Let's go get them!

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,320
They're drunk!

39
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,800
Let's kill them off!

40
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Teach'em a lesson!

41
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,880
They won't come around here!

42
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's show 'em!

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,760
Save your ammunition, Mayor!

44
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,680
Faster, innkeeper!
We mustn't let them get away!

45
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,600
Stop drinking, pope, and pray!

46
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
Jesus Christ, wolves!

47
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,240
More wolves!

48
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,000
Women, protect the children!

49
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,840
Mummy, where are you?

50
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,200
Wolves!

51
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
Janek!

52
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,720
I had a premonition...

53
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,080
Goran, the shutters!

54
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
Our Father,
who art in Heaven ...

55
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Hurry, they're here!

56
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,840
The beasts!

57
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,440
Those idiots took my gun!

58
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Where's the axe?

59
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,200
My baby!

60
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,960
I'll hack you to pieces

61
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,080
Verona!

62
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
Granny, get out!

63
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,200
The innkeeper's wife
is in there...

64
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,920
Janek, save that child!

65
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
The trapdoor!

66
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,440
Verona and the child
are down there!

67
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,720
You're bleeding.

68
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,720
Don't cry, I'll bandage it.

69
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,920
They're eating the cakes!

70
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,520
At least they'll let us be.

71
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,240
Higher, quick!

72
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,040
Hurry, Verona!

73
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,080
Hold her fast, Goran!

74
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,760
They'll tear you up, Gran!

75
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,400
Don't go anywhere.
Stay with Goran.

76
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,640
Janek, take my hand!

77
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,440
Save Verona, Goran!

78
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,840
Don't look! No! You musn't!

79
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,320
Verona, you mustn't look!

80
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,560
Lord, why did You allow this?

81
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,640
Is there anyone alive here?

82
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Uncles!

83
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,360
It's Semek!

84
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,200
-Here, in the well!
-I'm drowning!

85
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,760
Search the houses,
maybe someone survived.

86
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,080
We lost all the women.

87
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,600
I did shoot,
sure as my name is Semek.

88
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,320
I barely reached the well.

89
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,520
Thank God she's a girl.

90
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,720
Want to see something?

91
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,880
Goran!

92
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,960
Let's go home, Daddy.

93
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,960
Go and see to the little girl.

94
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,920
Lord, why do you punish us?
Mother of God, pray for us.

95
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,360
This is Veronika.
When she grows up

96
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,000
she will be your bride, Goran,

97
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,240
because you saved us
from the wolves.

98
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
TEN YEARS LATER

99
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,240
Veronika, this is
your great day.

100
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,640
Your tenth birthday

101
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,080
and your engagement to Goran.

102
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
-Are you glad?
-Yes, Mum, because you're glad.

103
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
-May I go?
-Yes, go.

104
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
-Help yourself, Semek.
-Thank you, aunt Verona.

105
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,920
How nice!

106
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,480
Keep pouring, make the inn
a happy place again!

107
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,319
Goran, Veronika.

108
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,119
According to the fiancÃ©'s father
makes the first toast.

109
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,239
So few of us are left.

110
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:49,439
The gods have made you
our future,

111
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,079
our hope and promise.

112
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,079
To your health!

113
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,399
A thousand years of happiness!

114
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,319
To you, dearest!

115
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,239
To an early wedding!

116
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,999
You have a lot of waiting
ahead, Goran!

117
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,919
Silence!

118
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,479
Listen!

119
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,199
Wolves! The wolves are back!

120
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,079
Let's get them!

121
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:27,839
We'll kill them off.

122
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,959
Now we'll show them.

123
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:32,319
The message is clear.

124
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:47,679
Do you always greet people
with guns?

125
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,919
Is there a war on?

126
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,159
-Who are you?
-Ordinary people.

127
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,439
Hungry as wolves
and mild as sheep.

128
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,838
So many women!

129
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,758
Circus artists!

130
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,638
I'm the Showman, their boss.
We're en route abroad.

131
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:08,198
Give us some food, we'll pay
you well, and then we'll leave.

132
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:11,398
Come closer so we can see you.

133
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,518
You have some fine girls.

134
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:19,038
-Irena's the loveliest.
-I'm the Mayor.

135
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:22,558
Irena also holds
the purse-strings.

136
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:25,278
Madina. That's my name.

137
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,838
Have you lost your way?

138
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:33,278
I bet you want to cross
the border at night!

139
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,878
I love smart people, Mayor.

140
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:40,878
There are borderguards,
but the snow's the worst.

141
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,198
I never want anything for free.

142
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,518
Thank you, lrena.

143
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,798
You don't understand.

144
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:54,518
Not even diamonds would
help you in winter.

145
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,278
You'd need wings.

146
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,998
Any other ideas, Mayor?

147
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:03,158
We have some empty houses,
also a mill.

148
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:06,998
Wait a few weeks
untill the snow's gone.

149
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:09,358
A few weeks?

150
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:13,558
That's an eternity.
And time is money.

151
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,758
-Don't go yet, Simon.
-No, I've had enough.

152
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,437
Good night.

153
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:27,197
God bless.

154
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,877
Veronika, see Goran out.

155
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,997
And we're home.

156
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:40,117
I'll help you, Juzek.

157
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:46,197
See, my friend?

158
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:50,557
There are ever more wolves
among the humans too.

159
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:55,997
What the beasts don't destroy,
the humans will.

160
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:29,797
She could knock out a bear.

161
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:35,597
You promised a house,
but you gave us ruins.

162
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:39,597
Joseph worked at the border.
He can deal with the guards.

163
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:42,236
We should bribe the chief.

164
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,516
It'll be expensive.

165
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,876
Just settle the price.

166
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:52,556
Stop staring, pope!

167
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:56,876
Our Jirinka is the tallest
woman in the world.

168
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,596
She grew up in a convent.

169
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:04,636
It's my lrena who keeps
the circus together.

170
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:08,676
No money problems to shackle us
to the ground.

171
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:14,796
The duo from La Scala,
Margot and Fagot!

172
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:19,676
And Chocolate, the innocent
flower of Africa!

173
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:23,996
You have everything. Women!
We have nothing.

174
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,156
A Gipsy?
That's not very kosher, Boss!

175
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:31,356
See those orphans,
with my son Michael?

176
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:34,196
Their parents were stars!

177
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:38,076
Circus folk have short lives.

178
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:44,476
You provide the eats,
we'll supply the art.

179
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:49,076
Let's roll out a cask
of rose-hip wine!

180
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:54,636
-Three casks!
-I'll bring some moonshine.

181
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:57,396
Moonshine? Never heard of it.

182
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:01,356
A few drops work wonders.

183
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:04,355
Isn't it poisonous?

184
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:07,395
It's a cure, priest.

185
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:10,635
The only medicine
for a sick soul.

186
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,120
-It's liquor!
-Right!

187
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,039
Those circus gals

188
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:31,395
are classier broads
than ours were!

189
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,512
I wish Madina'd leave one here.

190
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,588
If we get the Showman drunk,

191
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:41,865
I can win Marlyn at cards.

192
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,978
We'll make her village property.

193
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,169
I'll wager the mill, meadow
and woods against Marlyn!

194
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:00,966
The message is clear!

195
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:08,678
-Isn't she worth more to you?
-I'll throw in my house and pig

196
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,113
-Semek, shuffle the cards.
-The message is clear.

197
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:17,230
Thirty, twenty, done.

198
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:26,181
You can't stay when
they're playing cards.

199
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,994
There's nothing to fear.
Our girl sleeps here alone.

200
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,715
Dad says there are wolves
here that eat children.

201
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:42,349
-Your father is exaggerating.
-No, he isn't.

202
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:44,427
He'll win it all by morning.

203
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:47,384
When he's wearing rainbow vest
he never loses.

204
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:50,141
Maybe it brings him luck.

205
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,417
No, it's magic.

206
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:55,335
Ten...

207
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,412
And ten.

208
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,127
We're screwed.

209
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:07,522
What about you?
Throwing in some more?

210
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,877
The ladies are still in the pot

211
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:14,435
We still have a church left.

212
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,352
Good night.

213
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:23,984
-What's your name?
-Veronika! And yours?

214
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,941
Michael.
Can I sleep in your bed?

215
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:29,099
If you like.

216
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:36,651
Are you frightened? Scared of
walking the tightrope, too?

217
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,767
I don't, my father forbids it.

218
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:44,043
-Scared of him, too?
-Everyone is.

219
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:49,037
Of my mother, too.

220
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:51,634
Gotchar!

221
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,432
Twenty-one!

222
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:56,109
We have twenty-one!

223
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,186
Jirinka is mine!

224
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:02,383
Sorry, ladies,
I can't get rid of you.

225
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,301
Two aces.

226
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:09,535
You're the devil!

227
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,890
Jirinka, I lost you!

228
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,807
That's enough. To bed!

229
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:19,364
You too, clown.

230
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:22,161
Wait, Verona!
Now I'm playing for you!

231
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:27,396
I'll wager all the money
I've got here and in my trunk!

232
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:28,514
Plus the circus!

233
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:29,873
The message is clear!

234
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,221
-And all the women!
-For this shitty peasant?

235
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:34,732
So many women - paradise!

236
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,003
Verona, take it.

237
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:39,858
Right. We need women.

238
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:44,369
Let's play together, Matous.

239
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:48,622
Aren't you hot, Madina?

240
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,279
Take off your vest.
You're sweating.

241
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,378
I don't mind a bit of sweat.

242
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,511
But I do.

243
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:05,472
Or wouldn't you win
without your vest?

244
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,544
A wise guy?

245
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:26,595
If you like my vest,
we can play for it.

246
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:31,125
I'll add it to the pot.

247
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,533
Drunk old fart!

248
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,912
Enough.

249
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,256
Fourteen. That's not much.

250
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,959
Hell!

251
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:10,915
The women are ours!

252
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:15,710
We won! The girls are ours!

253
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,266
Verona, do you need
seven slaves?

254
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:23,943
Take back your house, Mayor.

255
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:27,020
Give me the blonde.

256
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:30,496
We'll divide up
the money tomorrow,

257
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:32,894
fight it out for the women now.

258
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:34,812
The message is clear!

259
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,486
First you marry me!
Where's your church?

260
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,004
I'll show you in the morning.

261
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:49,998
She's mine!

262
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,636
The message is clear!

263
00:24:52,995 --> 00:24:55,753
His pockets were full of aces!

264
00:24:56,392 --> 00:24:59,149
I'm floating like an angel.

265
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:06,462
Marlyn, I'll be your motorcycle.

266
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:10,579
-You pig!
-You can ride me!

267
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:15,494
-I have my human rights!
-I have my human needs!

268
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,887
Jirinka, you're an arch
in my temple of Christ!

269
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:26,284
My victory arch.

270
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,559
It's our turn
Let's go to the mill.

271
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:35,475
There's the pussy
who smokes cigars.

272
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:40,111
The titsy cashier's for me.

273
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,109
How about me?

274
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:44,786
Take the old one.
Even you can manage her.

275
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:47,544
The message is clear!

276
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:50,181
Be gentle, we're artists!

277
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:57,255
You saw through him, Verona.

278
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:00,931
It's happy days
like harvest-time!

279
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:04,847
Pity it's only for one night.

280
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:10,322
Irena and Max are gone!

281
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:14,438
So is the money!
You have no circus!

282
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:16,716
This is what they left.

283
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:19,194
The orphans and me, that's all.

284
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:21,112
What's this hick doing here?

285
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:23,350
You should've seen
the goings on last night!

286
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,747
Swine! ls this gratitude?

287
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:29,864
Irena, you ungrateful whore!

288
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:35,858
I risked jail to show
your brother the ropes.

289
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:39,415
And you threw me overboard?

290
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:44,410
Degenerate clowns!

291
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,806
You can't even raise a tent
without me.

292
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:53,522
I've lost my circus,
my money, my vest!

293
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,957
In this damn hole!

294
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:02,074
I hope you fall on concrete
and don't die,

295
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:05,470
and have no money for a doctor.

296
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,948
I always come up on top.

297
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:09,666
I'll be stinking rich yet.

298
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:12,704
I can start again, even here!

299
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:21,855
O Lord, bless our seeds
and let them grow...

300
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,557
Pull! It's not a motorcycle.

301
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:30,953
Sowing poppy and hemp
means ploughing deep.

302
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:32,871
Shit on this!

303
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:34,469
Oh no you don't.

304
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,946
We'll be rich soon.

305
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:43,300
Poppy and hemp! Drives me nuts.

306
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,816
Keep pulling, poppy-head!

307
00:27:50,932 --> 00:27:52,291
It might even grow.

308
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,847
Madina's said so,
he know what's what.

309
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:01,042
See Goran, Michael?
He has a horse.

310
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,719
When I grow up,
I'll be his wife.

311
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:08,434
So what? Look, I caught it.

312
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:13,069
-Look at its feathers.
-It's a hemp tit.

313
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,865
It's only a baby,
let it go, Michael.

314
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,462
D'you know what it's worth
in the city?

315
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:24,937
-What's this?
-It's called electricity.

316
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:30,491
-That's beautiful!
-Don't burn yourself.

317
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,888
On windy days we have light
like in the city.

318
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:36,485
I'd love to live in a city.

319
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:39,202
Look!

320
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:42,758
We don't need stupid horses
like your husband does.

321
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:45,556
When I grow up,
I'll live in town.

322
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:49,392
You can come with me, Veronika.

323
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:55,825
-Really, Michael?
-Close your eyes.

324
00:28:58,063 --> 00:28:59,261
Michael!

325
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:02,218
City people do this
when they're in love.

326
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:06,014
-You'll really take me?
-I swear.

327
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:08,811
So I'll close them again.

328
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,439
Electricity must be beautiful

329
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:25,035
if city people
keep closing their eyes.

330
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:46,373
A FEW YEARS LATER

331
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:58,840
I'd get them!

332
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,796
Up to your old games again,
Michael?

333
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:04,594
Get off my back, old fart.

334
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:06,232
Shut up!

335
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,549
The guards are gone.

336
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,025
Let's go, then.

337
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:22,175
Quiet! We'll be home in no time.

338
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:33,564
Hold the horses!
Something's coming down!

339
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:39,078
Rocks are falling!

340
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:42,275
It's an earthquake, kid.

341
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:47,349
Shit! ls this the place?

342
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,827
Smugglers! There they are!

343
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:52,304
Halt! Come back!

344
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:54,702
Next time stay home,
Michael, damn you!

345
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:58,658
Get back! That's an order!

346
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,734
We're going, men.

347
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:07,888
Kiss our arses, guards!

348
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:11,804
Move, hunchback,
they'll shoot your cock off!

349
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:17,079
What happened, Michael?

350
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,037
An earthquake. Otherwise, okay.

351
00:31:20,397 --> 00:31:24,513
We sold the goods,
bought horses and sheep.

352
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:28,029
Why did they shoot?

353
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:29,907
Did you give him less money?

354
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,904
Me? Same as always.

355
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:35,702
So why the shooting?

356
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,778
Some of the guards
are honest, the swine.

357
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:45,332
Better talk to your son. He's
been up to old his tricks again.

358
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:49,128
That was the last time, Matous.

359
00:31:49,648 --> 00:31:51,126
I nearly died of fear.

360
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:54,882
Innkeeper,
did you swallow a ruler?

361
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,550
Matous?

362
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:12,185
He's dead.

363
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,177
Pour out the drink! Forty sheep!

364
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:39,558
Blessed Mary, what
are you punishing me for?

365
00:32:41,196 --> 00:32:45,672
You took my bride-groom,
and now Matous!

366
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:03,734
That earthquake was a warning!

367
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:08,249
-Go to bed.
-The cards told me.

368
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:15,362
If we don't leave,
more will die, Madina..

369
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,999
The cards never lie.

370
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,555
-Don't scare us.
-She's right.

371
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:28,429
Today, the innkeeper.
Who will it be tomorrow?

372
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:31,506
When bribed men fire at us
it's time to stop.

373
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:33,863
The border won't be closed
forever.

374
00:33:34,183 --> 00:33:35,981
That's why we need to rake in
a lot of money fast.

375
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:38,619
I don't mean to stay
here forever.

376
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:42,095
We need a new plan.

377
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,292
Give me the gun.

378
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:48,289
We need a different set-up.

379
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:51,406
I'm sick of your cowboy games.

380
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:54,603
Don't hang around.

381
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:58,119
Take the money from Vayda
and come home.

382
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:14,263
You shouldn't have
let him go, Mother.

383
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:18,898
He wouldn't listen.

384
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:29,328
He wanted to give you
a grand wedding.

385
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,004
I'm too young to marry, Mother.

386
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:36,281
When I got married,

387
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,558
I also thought I was too young.

388
00:34:44,912 --> 00:34:47,790
In fact, it was too late.

389
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:53,943
I don't want to leave you,
Mother.

390
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,501
I'll help you.

391
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:06,461
Goran saved us from the wolves
so I promised he could have you.

392
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:11,136
Promises mustn't be broken.

393
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:14,493
That's the order of things.

394
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:18,489
Don't cry, Mother.
We'll help you, too.

395
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:28,639
God's rocking us!

396
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:34,473
Brother! Joseph!

397
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:39,588
The world is lopsided!

398
00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:44,183
What's bitten you?

399
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,500
I have two messages!
One is clear,

400
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,357
the other unclear!

401
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:54,592
But the clear message
isn't very clear either.

402
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:57,629
I'm tipsy!

403
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:00,626
We're tilted over!

404
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:06,938
-An earthquake!
-It's from the poppies!

405
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:12,812
-The message is clear!
-A fucking earthquake!

406
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:18,245
Why only our house?
The others are upright!

407
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:22,920
Help me push it back!

408
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,481
Veronika, leave Katka
and Jenik at Goran's.

409
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:40,583
That's what we get
for not going to church!

410
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:44,384
It's for owing Matous a twenty!

411
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:51,306
Matous, I'll buy some brandy
and pour it on your grave!

412
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,627
The best slivowitz!
Sacramental wine!

413
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:59,389
Just straighten our house,
damn you!

414
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:04,990
He's talking to
your father, Veronika.

415
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:10,152
Semek tilted his house!

416
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:13,153
He's crazy.
He was bitten by wolves!

417
00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:19,595
Hold my horse, give him water.

418
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:27,798
-Hello, chief.
-God bless, Michael.

419
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:32,079
I've come for an advance
on the horses, Vayda.

420
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,840
We want money. No bartering.

421
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,201
Money isn't everything.

422
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:40,962
What kind of smuggler are you?

423
00:37:41,322 --> 00:37:43,843
Anyone with balls has a gun!

424
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:47,604
My old man has a gun...
but this!

425
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:52,245
-I'll get you a smaller one.
-I like it.

426
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:59,928
You don't call me your beauty
any more, Mike.

427
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:02,089
Don't you want to marry me?

428
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,129
I don't have time now.

429
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:08,091
Make your choice,
if you can't ride two of us.

430
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,720
Am I less important to you
than your Veronika?

431
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,880
Don't spy on me!

432
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,680
I'm your destiny.
Your happiness.

433
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,840
Enough!

434
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,880
-Go to hell, varmint!
-As you wish.

435
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,281
Go to her, white swine,
and you've had it!

436
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,121
You're finished...

437
00:38:58,441 --> 00:38:59,801
Hi, Uncle Goran!

438
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:02,641
Katka! Jenik! My helpers!

439
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:05,881
I'm first on the swing!

440
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,400
Where did you leave Veronika?

441
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,400
Herding sheep to the chalet.

442
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,440
And your Mother?

443
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,160
She keeps crying.

444
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,440
You'll get used to it.

445
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,400
Just like me and Misha.

446
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:32,921
It's better than the circus.

447
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:35,321
Martin's a fine mother.

448
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:40,121
-Hello, jazzmen!
-Hello, Michael!

449
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:42,441
I have to go home.

450
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,240
Hello, ladies.
Hello, Lucy.

451
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,000
Michael, can we brush the horse?

452
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You can ride it, too.

453
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,520
Bring it back to the mill
after the funeral.

454
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,680
The world isn't going to end.
So you'll marry him, so what.

455
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,480
I'll never stop loving you.

456
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,840
You'd do better to help me.
Stop it!

457
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,920
How can I help you?

458
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,520
You don't want to marry Goran,

459
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,360
nor make love with me!

460
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,440
If you were to carry my child,

461
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,840
there would be no wedding.

462
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,760
You promised to take me to town

463
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,240
How about a snort instead?

464
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,120
Let's run away together.

465
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,840
It's made from poppies,
that's our living.

466
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,760
I'd rather die than marry Goran.

467
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,120
Dad says a man shot
by the guards is a hero.

468
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,760
May you be remembered, Matous...

469
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,720
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

470
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,000
Who'll be first at the inn?

471
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,600
Semek! Come and dance!

472
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,640
Vayda didn't pay much,
but there's a lot here anyway.

473
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,320
This was the innkeeper's.
We'll split it, too.

474
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,720
No, give it to Verona!

475
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,040
But after today we'll
split the extra money.

476
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,160
She didn't shed a tear
at the funeral.

477
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,240
She's beside herself,
'cause she won't get laid now.

478
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,880
I'll be a smuggler. Gimme!

479
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,160
You swiped it! Give it back!

480
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,400
-Just like the Mayor's.
-You'll shoot your eye out.

481
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,120
The message is clear.
You just cock it...

482
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,680
Take it away from him!

483
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,160
Then you pull...

484
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,360
Stop, you idiot!

485
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,320
What a hero you are!

486
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,800
You show off in front of
the girls, and duck the crazies!

487
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,280
Get off my back!

488
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,800
It's not my fault you could
only get the nigger chick!

489
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,760
What did you say, shithead?

490
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,320
You junkie!

491
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,680
If I blow your head off,
I'll get a medal!

492
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,840
Stop it, Joseph!

493
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,720
-What's the hurry, Juzek?
-Business is business.

494
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,640
You're nothing but trouble,
you and your Dad!

495
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,280
It's your fault they've
forgotten how to sow oats!

496
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,880
We just smuggle
hemp and poppies.

497
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,600
And stuff your pockets!

498
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,800
If you can't hold your liquor,
take Chocolate and go home!

499
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,440
I want a victory arch!
At least ten times!

500
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,320
You'll wake the children.

501
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,200
-First show me your bird.
-Two poppy tits.

502
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:52,681
-Three arches.
-Five, at least!

503
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,441
Four, but quickly.

504
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,361
Your bird gets smaller
and smaller.

505
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:00,921
Time enough, Jirinka.

506
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:04,801
The priest's playing cards.

507
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,122
And he's forgotten his promises.

508
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:12,322
I have to take care of him,
the church and the fields.

509
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:17,922
I have to deal in birds
to get an organ.

510
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:24,602
"You know this song?
""He promised her kingdom come"" "

511
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,443
Shut up and start marching!

512
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:37,043
He promised her kingdom come
then gave her his bare thumb.

513
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:39,043
The first arch!

514
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:46,564
Second!

515
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,084
Keep out of this, Michael!

516
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:51,804
I could keep the pub in funds
like Matous did

517
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:54,604
and you'd save money.

518
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:59,564
For you, such a fine a widow.

519
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:06,205
I'm the one that fired, Semek!

520
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:11,725
The message is clear!
I'll be a smuggler!

521
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:18,685
I'll smuggle sheep, goats,
poppies and hemp!

522
00:45:19,685 --> 00:45:21,726
Idiot! He'll kill us all!

523
00:45:25,006 --> 00:45:26,566
The heathen!

524
00:45:30,006 --> 00:45:32,246
We've said it all.

525
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:35,966
So go home, Michael.

526
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:39,207
I'll never marry Goran.

527
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:42,967
He's an old man!

528
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:46,767
Michael would ruin your life!

529
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:50,287
-I won't allow it.
-I don't care!

530
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,208
Good night, all!

531
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,010
Don't worry, Goran.

532
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,290
I'll straighten her out.

533
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,410
I like crystal-clear messages.

534
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,290
I'll have to settle this myself.

535
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,931
A circus clown screwed my bride.

536
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:54,251
Veronika is a virgin.

537
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,971
And stop boozing.

538
00:46:57,891 --> 00:46:59,291
Gimme that!

539
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,851
You'll ruin your life, Goran!

540
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,691
That remains to be seen.

541
00:47:45,974 --> 00:47:49,134
Mother'll never forgive me.

542
00:47:50,174 --> 00:47:52,174
Forget about her.

543
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:56,534
No! I don't want it!

544
00:47:57,494 --> 00:48:00,654
You want me, not Goran!

545
00:48:05,455 --> 00:48:08,375
Do it, quick! Even if I die!

546
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:11,375
I can't live without you!

547
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:37,656
-It's Michael.
-He overdid it last night.

548
00:48:38,096 --> 00:48:39,576
I'll wake him.

549
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:42,617
Michael, your horse!

550
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
He's dead!

551
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,480
It's my fault, son.

552
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,080
I let you get away
with anything!

553
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,720
We should've left and let
the devil take the money.

554
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,320
I'll find your murderer.

555
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,000
I promise, my son.

556
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,320
I'll avenge you, Michael.

557
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,560
Who knows who did it?

558
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,080
Whoever it was,
hand in all your guns tomorrow.

559
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,920
I know who shot you, Michael.

560
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,440
The message is clear.

561
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,280
My Michael...

562
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,960
Give it to me, Jenik!

563
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,880
Be good, children.

564
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,240
Cheers to the newlyweds!

565
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,000
A thousand years of happiness!

566
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Look, my tree is in pain too.

567
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,320
-They shouldn't have married.
-Why not?

568
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,680
Veronika's not like you.

569
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,320
She doesn't have your strength.
She should live in town.

570
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,760
And they didn't marry for love.

571
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,560
Did any one us marry for love?

572
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,880
You promised us off
in our cradles.

573
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,000
My son should have married you.

574
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,600
He was only ten when I married.

575
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,120
Sow the seed in March or May.

576
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,680
Wheat ripens at the same time.

577
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,960
Veronika, Goran!

578
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,880
It's your happy day!
And they opened the border!

579
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,320
No longer shall we be living
at the end of the world.

580
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,280
We'll become a crossroads!

581
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,720
Not even the wedding
held them back.

582
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,040
-They hope for better pastures.
-I'm off and away!

583
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,840
Joseph, Semek, wait!

584
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,000
Let's have a drink for the road.

585
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,280
We may be back in a week.

586
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,000
I'll send you seeds
for American tobacco!

587
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,280
What's in your suitcase, Semek?

588
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,160
Right now nothing!

589
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,720
When I come back,
it'll be full of gold!

590
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,680
Are you really leaving?

591
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,000
Who knows how long
the border'll stay open.

592
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,960
Goodbye, Semek!

593
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,400
Good luck!

594
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,880
The message is clear!

595
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,960
Hope to see you again
in this world, not the next!

596
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,320
She's forgotten you already,
Michael.

597
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,280
-What is it, Misha?
-A tummy-ache.

598
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,880
Have some water, it'll pass.

599
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,760
Goran, you're the only
real man here...

600
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,560
Verona!

601
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,000
A handsome Gipsy boy

602
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,240
gave me a ring to keep.
I took his ring and weep

603
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,360
I don't want a lover yet!

604
00:54:03,002 --> 00:54:05,282
Michael had you, didn't he?

605
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:16,083
You were his.

606
00:54:49,724 --> 00:54:52,044
They shouldn't have married.

607
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,129
An earthquake!

608
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:31,649
Misha!

609
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:33,649
The end of the world!

610
00:56:34,049 --> 00:56:37,369
Calm down, folks.
It's just a storm.

611
00:56:38,089 --> 00:56:40,369
Lighting struck the tree.

612
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:45,369
It's not a storm.
It's a sign from God.

613
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,850
-I can't find Misha!
-He was sleeping in the barn.

614
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,330
Go and find him.

615
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,650
Misha!

616
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,490
Here's his hat.

617
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,210
Misha!

618
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,850
What's wrong, lovey?

619
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:35,532
Blessed Mary!

620
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:37,612
It was an earthquake!

621
00:57:37,972 --> 00:57:40,492
All the houses sank
into the ground.

622
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:42,852
The earth will swallow us.

623
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:49,852
Semek's house
is straight again.

624
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:52,933
Don't go in there, children!

625
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:59,253
Do we sleep in the loft, Mum?

626
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:06,933
Lord, why do You try us so?

627
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:17,294
As usual.
Nothing happened to Verona.

628
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:23,814
The inn's sitting there
snug as an arse on a nightpot.

629
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:28,414
It sank a bit,
but we can still live in it.

630
00:58:28,734 --> 00:58:31,374
Live in it, then. We're moving.

631
00:58:31,734 --> 00:58:33,014
Let's take Semek's house,
children.

632
00:58:33,334 --> 00:58:35,294
'Bye, Daddy!

633
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:40,695
Don't be silly,
we had a good life here!

634
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:43,415
They left and God straightened
their house.

635
00:58:43,735 --> 00:58:45,655
And we're in the shits again.

636
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:22,417
All these rose-hips,
we'll have a lot of wine.

637
00:59:22,817 --> 00:59:25,937
I'll be an innkeeper
like my father.

638
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:31,017
-Blow on it, Mummy.
-Show me.

639
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:39,617
It's going to rain.

640
00:59:39,937 --> 00:59:42,178
Let's run to the brook.

641
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:43,378
No.

642
00:59:43,698 --> 00:59:46,178
What if we get drenched?

643
00:59:46,658 --> 00:59:48,378
All right,

644
00:59:48,738 --> 00:59:54,018
but whoever spills
any hips, loses.

645
00:59:55,218 --> 00:59:57,378
And... go!

646
00:59:58,778 --> 01:00:00,778
I'm going to win!

647
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:05,699
She's cheating!
She jumps like a goat!

648
01:00:07,659 --> 01:00:09,739
I won!

649
01:00:10,779 --> 01:00:14,059
Don't drink icy water, Jenik.

650
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,720
Do you hear?

651
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,159
I'm thirsty and
I have a tummy-ache.

652
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,719
Blessed Mary! You're burning up!

653
01:00:41,518 --> 01:00:44,358
Quick, he's dying!

654
01:00:44,678 --> 01:00:46,118
We'll save him.

655
01:00:46,478 --> 01:00:49,717
Lord, be merciful...

656
01:00:54,437 --> 01:00:56,157
The prayers aren't helping.

657
01:00:56,557 --> 01:00:58,556
The Lord has forsaken us.

658
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:02,156
Drink, you'll feel better.

659
01:01:06,036 --> 01:01:08,476
The sacred herbs will help.

660
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:13,475
You Christians mouth prayers
all day.

661
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,355
You'd do better
to see justice done!

662
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:20,035
Even your blessed Mary's
sick of you!

663
01:01:20,355 --> 01:01:22,674
Not me, I'm half Jewish.

664
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:24,714
What about my son's murder?

665
01:01:25,034 --> 01:01:28,314
I confiscated all the guns!

666
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:31,554
-Goran's too?
-He didn't have one!

667
01:01:31,914 --> 01:01:34,273
If you suspect him,
bring me proof!

668
01:01:34,593 --> 01:01:36,793
I suspect you all.

669
01:01:39,513 --> 01:01:43,913
The city police are here!

670
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:46,472
Oh shit!

671
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:05,191
-Where's the patient?
-She just woke up.

672
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:10,990
You're our last hope,
for the whole village.

673
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,830
You should have sent for us
sooner.

674
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,830
My boy died, Doctor.
She's all I have.

675
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,549
I'll pay anything.

676
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:24,309
Money's not all.

677
01:02:25,269 --> 01:02:27,429
Just save her for me.

678
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:30,948
Sergeant, test this right away.

679
01:02:38,908 --> 01:02:43,307
Don't cry, Jirinka.
Your children are in heaven.

680
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:49,387
Let's have some fun.
Make you forget.

681
01:02:52,747 --> 01:02:54,466
It's healthy, too.

682
01:02:54,826 --> 01:02:58,586
Get out, you heathen!

683
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:00,826
God has forsaken me

684
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:03,666
because of your filthy mind,
you lousy hunchback!

685
01:03:04,026 --> 01:03:07,985
One more arch! You could
have had your organ!

686
01:03:23,024 --> 01:03:26,464
We've taken measures to
stop the epidemic.

687
01:03:26,824 --> 01:03:30,423
The infection is from animals,

688
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:34,383
probably smuggled sheep.

689
01:03:35,303 --> 01:03:37,543
Yes. Shoot them.

690
01:03:38,303 --> 01:03:39,942
Water...

691
01:03:45,782 --> 01:03:48,622
Drink, Katka.

692
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:04,940
-Wake up, smuggler.
-Are the sheep yours?

693
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,780
You're under arrest.

694
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,940
Why?

695
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,939
All the children
are on your conscience.

696
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:17,659
He's drying hemp here.

697
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:20,659
Burn the filthy stuff.

698
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:35,138
He only minds the sheep!

699
01:04:36,697 --> 01:04:40,617
-Martin, say something!
-Be quiet, Lucie!

700
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,800
Doctor!

701
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,319
What is it?

702
01:04:47,879 --> 01:04:49,878
She can't breathe.

703
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:03,356
I'm sorry, but...

704
01:05:06,715 --> 01:05:09,034
How can they live here?

705
01:05:42,348 --> 01:05:44,187
My children...

706
01:05:55,305 --> 01:05:56,785
Katka!

707
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:09,302
Right, I'll accept that
the sheep are only his.

708
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:12,941
But you're all growing
poppies and hemp!

709
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,301
Nothing else grows here.

710
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:21,260
If you can't live off the land
we'll move you away.

711
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:25,459
This is a free country
and you're under surveillance.

712
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,418
Sure, Captain.

713
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:30,858
If you break the law again,

714
01:06:31,178 --> 01:06:34,577
I'll have all your crops
destroyed.

715
01:06:34,897 --> 01:06:37,576
Yes, General.

716
01:06:43,615 --> 01:06:45,775
No, Martin!

717
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:55,053
Lucie...

718
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:59,172
He's forbidden everything,
even arse-kissing.

719
01:06:59,532 --> 01:07:02,771
It's Goran's fault
for bringing them!

720
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:05,531
They didn't help us, anyway.

721
01:07:17,008 --> 01:07:21,367
They lock away an innocent,
and let a murderer go free.

722
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,925
Martin!

723
01:07:34,005 --> 01:07:35,884
Lucie!

724
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:43,243
I'll wait for you,
the baby and me!

725
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:52,881
If they don't release him,
Lucie won't last the winter.

726
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:55,480
He took all the blame.
