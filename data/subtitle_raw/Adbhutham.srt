00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:52,667
<i>Life is a battle.</i>

3
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,542
<i>You must fight and win.</i>

4
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,583
<i>Show the world what you're made of.</i>

5
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,250
<i>Once you know
what the world demands,</i>

6
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:03,750
<i>you can show it your success and
the attitude that comes with it</i>

7
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,458
<i>and then say a thousand
motivational quotes like I just did.</i>

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,583
<i>My frustration is
at such a peak now...</i>

9
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,126
<i>that it's not going anywhere.</i>

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,625
<i>Our sins lead us
to wherever we end up.</i>

11
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,625
<i>You need strong reasons to live.</i>

12
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,375
<i>But, to die,</i>

13
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,875
<i>all you need is a small excuse.</i>

14
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:30,959
Shame on your life!

15
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,500
Who says such lines
before dying, Vennela?

16
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,583
Die bravely.

17
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,917
Good riddance.

18
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,418
Die!

19
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,667
Sorry, dad.

20
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,166
<i>I hate you, dad.
You did this.</i>

21
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,250
<i>Forgive me, dad.</i>

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,458
<i>I'll never forgive you.</i>

23
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,917
Hey! I told you
not to open that room.

24
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,166
‐It's really dusty in there, sir.
‐I don't care.

25
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,959
Wonder what he's got in there.

26
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,333
‐Hello.
‐Where are you, man?

27
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,000
‐Home. Why?
‐Why do you sound so cute?

28
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,208
‐Did you just wake up?
‐Hmm.

29
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,041
The guest is here.
We're waiting for you.

30
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,834
I can manage for 15 minutes.
Be here.

31
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,084
He's coming.

32
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:48,834
Food, again?

33
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:50,750
Don't know who sent it.

34
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,125
Who's sending it?

35
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:03,917
I don't like girls getting
too much education or freedom.

36
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,083
They act rebellious.

37
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,250
That is why I got both
my daughters married at 18.

38
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,293
She's the third.

39
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,542
I had to continue her studies
because she is stubborn.

40
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,875
Now, I think it's high time
that she gets married.

41
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,166
Do we have poison handy?

42
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,583
I think we emptied it.

43
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,125
What did you say?

44
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,417
Come here.

45
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,834
You've got me all dolled up.

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,917
I have to take the coffee to them.

47
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,041
Why don't I add some poison to it?

48
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,542
If the police ask,
we can tell it's food poisoning.

49
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,208
They'll want to know where
we bought the coffee powder.

50
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,875
Let's say from Pradeep's shop.

51
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:42,208
That idiot fondles my fingers
every time I take the bill.

52
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,291
He'll be framed for this.

53
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:47,375
I can happily go to Germany
and study automobile engineering.

54
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,333
How's my master plan sound?

55
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:53,460
This guy...

56
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,667
‐Hey! Want a cup of coffee?
‐No, thanks.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,166
Hey, stop!

58
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,667
Sister mixed poison in the coffee.

59
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,625
Ew! Don't make me do this, mom.

60
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,291
Please, please, please.

61
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,667
Didn't find poison.
Didn't mix it.

62
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,875
You can drink it.

63
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,500
Wow! What a beauty!

64
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:20,917
Please have it.

65
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,459
‐What do you do, son?
‐Software.

66
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:34,083
Is it the same kind where they fire
thousands of you during a crisis?

67
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,917
With my qualification,
people will be dying to hire me.

68
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,625
So, it's an unstable life.

69
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,750
Mom!

70
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,291
You two can go talk in private.

71
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,417
‐Excuse me.
‐Yes?

72
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,083
‐Please sit over there.
‐I'm comfortable here.

73
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,458
‐You sit there.
‐Hey! Get up!

74
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,667
Go sit there. Overexcited.

75
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:55,834
This is my bed.

76
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,166
It'll be ours when we're married.

77
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,959
‐I don't want this marriage.
‐Your dad told me you'll say that.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,792
I have 4 boyfriends, you know?

79
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,583
I have 10.

80
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,166
‐Huh?
‐I meant girlfriends.

81
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,291
I'm very straight.

82
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,375
You can't put up with me.

83
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,583
I'm really patient.

84
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,792
I go crazy every full moon
and new moon days.

85
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,418
I'll sleep at my friend's
those two days.

86
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,583
I bite when I'm pissed.

87
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:20,708
I'll get an injection.

88
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, fool!

89
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,917
Why would you still
want to marry me?

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What can I say?
The heart wants what it wants.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,333
Oh, god!

92
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,667
Please! I have dreams.

93
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,708
‐Don't come in my way.
‐Germany, right?

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,667
You could go to Jharkhand
after marriage for all I care.

95
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,708
I'll support you, baby.

96
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,250
‐What if I want to settle there?
‐Do that. I'll spend my life here.

97
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,542
Why do you want
to get married then?

98
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,083
If you're here and I'm overseas,
will we have kids on the phone?

99
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,208
Oh! I get it now.

100
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,625
You're assuming that,
if you agree to all my terms,

101
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,625
I'll marry you, bear kids
and be a homemaker.

102
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,291
I'll smother you with a pillow
on the wedding night.

103
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,083
Is that why you have
so many pillows?

104
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,375
Answer me!

105
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,667
Let's go back outside.

106
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,458
Uncle, I really like Vennela.

107
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,291
I don't want a single penny
as dowry.

108
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,668
Thanks, son.

109
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,583
Considering there's an age gap,
I want her to give me some time.

110
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,458
I'll get onto family planning
in a year.

111
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,543
What!

112
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,834
I don't mean a vasectomy.

113
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,208
I'll plan our future.

114
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,750
Once we have a kid or two,

115
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,792
doing household chores
shouldn't be difficult.

116
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,166
‐Hey!
‐I mean for her, dad.

117
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,126
Oh!

118
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,250
‐We'll take our leave then.
‐Sure.

119
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,457
The car broke down, sir.

120
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,707
Do you have a toolkit?

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hand me the spanner.

122
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,125
<i>This girl's a mechanic?</i>

123
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,208
It's nothing.
The crank sensor popped. I fixed it.

124
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,667
Start the car.

125
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,041
<i>So, that's why she has car posters
in her room.</i>

126
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:08,667
Go inside!

127
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,458
The sweets are delicious.

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,083
Where are the chips?

129
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,708
‐Inside, auntie.
‐Go get it.

130
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,583
Who are those 4 boyfriends?

131
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,583
He told you?

132
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:19,875
Have this.

133
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,166
You go crazy every full moon
and new moon days?

134
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,750
I was just trying to scare him.

135
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,667
Thank god I told them
about you beforehand.

136
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,667
Yelling at her won't help.

137
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,083
She's still a little kid.

138
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,208
This one?

139
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,333
She threatened to smother him
with a pillow on the wedding night.

140
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,500
You call her a little kid?

141
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,583
You said that?

142
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,458
She didn't say that.
That idiot's lying. Bad fellow.

143
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,250
I know you both a little too well.
Stop it.

144
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,417
This marriage will happen.

145
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,917
‐I don't want it.
‐Shut up.

146
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,291
I'm drained
getting your two sisters married.

147
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,708
He wants to marry you without dowry,
and you guys are fooling around?

148
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,584
Stop it!

149
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't get her married
to any loser who refuses dowry.

150
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,834
Have you even looked at him?

151
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,333
Owl‐faced idiot.

152
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,542
Damn right.

153
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,583
Dad, I'm not marrying him. Period.

154
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,208
Finally, what's your decision?

155
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,834
I'll give the GET exam
one last time.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,959
Go to Germany and pursue
automobile engineering.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,166
‐But you'll have to clear the exam.
‐I will, dad.

158
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,959
This is what you said
the last couple of times.

159
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,708
‐I don't trust you.
‐Do it one last time.

160
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,458
All right.
I'll get you married if you fail.

161
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,333
If you refuse,
I'll put my head under a train.

162
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,375
Okay.

163
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,834
Okay to what?
Your marriage or my death?

164
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,041
Dad, do whatever you want
if I fail this time.

165
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,917
When are the mock test
results coming?

166
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:32,917
This evening.

167
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,458
If I clear this,
the main exam is a given.

168
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,625
I know what it's going to be.

169
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,333
Come to me with the results.

170
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,041
‐Hello.
‐ <i>Hi, Surya. This is Sameer.</i>

171
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,959
<i>You never answer my calls.</i>

172
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:54,959
What's the matter?

173
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,667
<i>I have some shocking news.</i>

174
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,333
<i>This year the competition
is really, really big.</i>

175
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,417
<i>You have a prize money.</i>

176
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,417
Stop bragging.

177
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,917
Didn't I tell you
I'm not into it anymore?

178
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm out of it.

179
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,417
<i>Bro, just say yes.
I'll manage the rest.</i>

180
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,041
<i>Wild‐card entries, sponsors...</i>

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,083
Hello! Can't you see!

182
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,542
‐What are you doing?
‐Sorry.

183
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,000
What happened to the display?

184
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,125
My display is gone too.

185
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,291
Yeah, same here.

186
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,792
I'm going to smack you
if you don't shut up!

187
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,750
Yes, I drink. It's my wish.
Did your dad pay for it?

188
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,041
<i>‐Didn't my dad give you any money?</i>
‐My foot!

189
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,500
That money couldn't
even pay for my parties.

190
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,959
<i>You're always drunk and wasted.
Don't you care about your family.</i>

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,917
I drink whenever I think of you.

192
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,917
<i>You're acting up.
Better come home.</i>

193
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,208
Bugger off! I'll kill you
if you find you in my home.

194
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,792
<i>Say it to my face, you‐‐</i>

195
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,083
That was insane, sir.
Was it your wife?

196
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,291
No. Some wrong number.

197
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,750
I've been receiving a lot of
wrong calls since morning.

198
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,834
Why did you yell at her then?

199
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,625
Why do you care?
Is Surya here yet?

200
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,834
‐He's in makeup, sir.
‐Still?

201
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,959
‐ <i>Where are you?</i>
‐Checking up on Surya. Sorry, boss.

202
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,250
How long, man?
The guest's been waiting for an hour.

203
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,166
Boss is really pissed.
I can't manage him anymore.

204
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,041
<i>‐The guest is waiting, bro.</i>
‐I'm coming. Hold on.

205
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,792
Who's the guest?

206
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,875
‐Music director Tijori.
‐What has he achieved?

207
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,208
He's a great music director.
He's a music Taekwondo.

208
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,042
Says who?

209
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,792
Why would I take someone
for their word?

210
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,125
Am I looking like a foolish man?

211
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,250
That guy told me.

212
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,917
Surya is on the way. Be ready.

213
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,917
Hi. Hello and welcome to my show.

214
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,835
We have with us today music
rock legend, the rock king,

215
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,083
Mr. Mizoram!

216
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,000
It's not Mizoram or Manipur.

217
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,834
‐It's Tijori.
‐Yeah, that.

218
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:48,625
Idiot!

219
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,208
Why Tijori, sir? Your name
sounds musical. How, sir?

220
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,834
Actually, Tijori translates
to "treasure" in Hindi.

221
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,625
Unlike any newborn,
I didn't cry when I was born.

222
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
‐Apparently, I said Do‐Re‐Mi‐Fa.
‐Fantastic, sir.

223
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,250
So, even when you sing,
you sound like you're crying.

224
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,375
Next question, sir.

225
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,875
Sir, your recent song
"Pita Pita"...

226
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,667
For your information,
it's "Kita Kita."

227
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:15,417
Oh. When I heard it,
I had goosebumps all over my body.

228
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:16,458
How, sir?

229
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,875
When I was in Los Angeles,
at the Niagara Falls‐‐

230
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,875
Excuse me, sir.

231
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,625
Niagara Falls is not in LA.
It's in New York.

232
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,375
A stream flowed all the way
to LA. Do you mind?

233
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,834
Shut up and listen.

234
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,708
A girl from Costa Rica
kept staring at me.

235
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,125
She was in shock!

236
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,542
She wondered how a huge celebrity
is roaming in the US so freely.

237
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,917
Sir, who's the celebrity here?

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,083
Remove my mic, guys.

239
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,583
‐Oh, you're the celebrity.
‐It's me.

240
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,875
There I got an inspiration.

241
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,834
Her eyes were glowing.

242
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:47,417
That's when this magical sound
"Kita Kita" came to me.

243
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,375
Can you hum
a couple of lines for us?

244
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,291
<i>"A mad girl got on the plane"</i>

245
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,250
<i>"She poked my heart
With a popsicle"</i>

246
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:01,875
<i>"She blinked her eyes
Like Kita Kita Roma"</i>

247
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:02,667
How is it?

248
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,333
Sir, it's "Taki Taki" by DJ Snake.

249
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,917
This is my original tune.

250
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,583
Own composition.

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,667
Do I look like a copycat to you?

252
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,291
It's called copying
when you rip off the tune.

253
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,917
And it's a chartbuster
by DJ Snake.

254
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,959
Who the hell is this DJ Snake?
He's after all a snake.

255
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,708
I'm an anaconda.
Bloody fool!

256
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,166
This is my creativity.

257
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,792
Oh. You're a re‐creator, sir.
Not the creator.

258
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,917
‐Recreation is also an art.
‐Enough!

259
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,542
Let's stop the interview here.

260
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,875
‐Sir, I'm sorry.
‐Don't talk. Not a word.

261
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,000
‐Sir, please.
‐Where's your CEO? Call him here.

262
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,291
‐Sir, please. He is a kid.
‐Seriously?

263
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,959
People would've bashed me
if this was live.

264
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,959
‐Every idiot feels like a musician.
‐Sorry. sir.

265
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,917
What does he even know about music?

266
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,291
Amazing, dude!

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Come here.

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,918
Sir.

269
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,542
Is the show over?

270
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,125
You rascal!

271
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,917
‐I'll see your end.
‐ Sorry!

272
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,917
Tijori sir, Tijori sir!

273
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,667
Hold on, you fool!
I didn't mean you, sir.

274
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:24,959
Sir, please.

275
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:32,917
I came third.

276
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you so upset about?

277
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:36,917
Check mine.

278
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,792
Lord Rama! Please!

279
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:44,041
Make sure I pass.
I'll take you to Germany with me.

280
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,750
Oh, Lord Rama! Make sure I pass.

281
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:46,917
Please, please...

282
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,583
You failed.

283
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,792
Yes, you failed again.

284
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,125
Congrats for your marriage!

285
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,041
Shut up!

286
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,667
Hello, mom. I came third.

287
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,375
‐Don't tell dad yet.
‐Let's go.

288
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,375
<i>If you fail again,
you're definitely getting married.</i>

289
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,291
<i>What are girls going to achieve
by studying?</i>

290
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,542
<i>You're failing each and every time.</i>

291
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,917
<i>What are you if not a failure?</i>

292
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,959
How long will you stare, sir?
Say something!

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You speak.

294
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,750
I guess you're expecting
an apology.

295
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,208
I'm sorry. Let it go.

296
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,333
I'm asking this
as your dad's friend.

297
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,917
Don't you feel a tad bit guilty?

298
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,086
He copies other people's music.

299
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,542
Why should I feel guilty
when he's not?

300
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,125
You have the channel's reputation
to think about.

301
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,041
Sir! That interview of his
just went viral.

302
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,417
It's trending on social media.
You should throw a party.

303
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,417
‐Promise me.
‐Shut up!

304
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,667
Useless fellow.

305
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,750
Such a spoilsport!

306
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,708
I'll take my leave.

307
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,959
Don't come back!

308
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,166
Never show me your face again.

309
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,625
Are you good at anything at all?

310
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,125
Everybody makes mistakes.

311
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,750
Doesn't mean
you humiliate them on camera.

312
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:57,708
Didn't you make mistakes?

313
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,500
Your dad died
because of you, remember?

314
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:06,416
He'd always say that
you're obsessed with music.

315
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,208
He was worried about your future.

316
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,791
He said you couldn't make a living.

317
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,290
How could you take his life?

318
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,708
Bloody loser!

319
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:20,583
<i>Something strange has been
taking place in Hyderabad.</i>

320
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,458
<i>Cross connections of phone calls
and mysterious occurrences in the sky.</i>

321
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,041
What's the reason behind
the sky's sudden colour change?

322
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,000
What is the reason behind this?

323
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,959
Nobody knows the answer.

324
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,708
The public is concerned.

325
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,417
These changes in nature have
never been recorded earlier.

326
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,375
Hello? Can you hear me?

327
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,000
‐Hello!
‐Hello.

328
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,917
Shit! I can't even get
customer care.

329
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,125
What? Are you going upstairs?

330
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,250
What's wrong, sir?

331
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,291
<i>Even you failed me this time.</i>

332
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,583
<i>I'd rather die than marry that guy.</i>

333
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,625
<i>My death can become news.</i>

334
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,834
<i>But I don't want it
to become a nuisance.</i>

335
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:30,834
<i>How do I say it?</i>

336
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,625
<i>Suicide note.</i>

337
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,083
<i>I've made enough people
suffer already.</i>

338
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,208
<i>Whom do I send this to?</i>

339
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,500
<i>I don't want to trouble anyone.</i>

340
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,667
<i>I'll send it to my number
so that I receive the message.</i>

341
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,333
Correct.

342
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,458
<i>"Nobody is responsible
for my death."</i>

343
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,667
What?

344
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,750
Who is it?

345
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,083
Who sent the text?

346
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,418
One

347
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,458
<i>Hey! Who the hell are you?</i>

348
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,417
<i>Are you messing with me?</i>

349
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,208
<i>Hey! Who the hell are you?</i>

350
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,625
Cheapskate!

351
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,125
Did he just call me cheap?

352
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,417
<i>You weirdo! I'll cut off your tongue
if you don't shut up.</i>

353
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,125
<i>‐Who are you?
‐My name's Surya.</i>

354
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,041
<i>‐Who are you?
‐Vennela.</i>

355
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,458
<i>Whatever. Tell me what you want.</i>

356
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,708
<i>Answers.</i>

357
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,208
<i>How are you doing this?</i>

358
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,792
<i>Listen. I'm busy trying to die.
Don't annoy me.</i>

359
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:23,792
<i>Why?</i>

360
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,917
<i>Do I need your permission?</i>

361
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,333
<i>I don't care.</i>

362
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,542
<i>Tell me how you're texting me
from my number.</i>

363
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,708
What?

364
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,042
Oh, crap!

365
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,000
We have the same phone number!

366
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,625
‐Hello?
<i>‐Where the hell are you?</i>

367
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,959
Nowhere, dad.

368
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,125
<i>What?</i>

369
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,333
I'm at Durgam Cheruvu, dad.
What is it?

370
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,041
<i>Grandma had a heart attack.
Come fast!</i>

371
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,001
What?

372
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,500
‐How is she now?
<i>‐She's in the ICU.</i>

373
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,041
‐Which hospital?
<i>‐Maitri Hospital.</i>

374
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,125
Coming, dad.

375
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,543
Hey!

376
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,500
Are you out of your mind?

377
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,208
‐I have something to ask you.
‐Go ahead.

378
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,917
Can two people have
the same number?

379
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,667
Which number? PAN or Aadhar?

380
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,041
Phone number, you idiot!

381
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:38,667
What are you doing?

382
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,291
‐Making a call.
‐To whom?

383
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,750
‐My number.
‐You're calling your own number?

384
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,792
‐Yeah. It's busy.
‐Does that mean you have to jump?

385
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,875
Sir, I don't want this money.

386
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,125
Just be happy.

387
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,417
Lord should bless you.

388
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,625
Hey! Give it to me. Amen!

389
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,291
Take this.

390
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,917
Don't tell anybody about this. Go.

391
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,083
‐Something is wrong, dude.
‐Okay, sir.

392
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,792
Vennela has the same number as me.
I don't know how.

393
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,458
The moonlight
also uses a mobile phone?

394
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah! And it's the same number.

395
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,542
Do these clouds, stars, coconut
trees and hills also have numbers?

396
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,708
I don't mean the moonlight.
It's a girl.

397
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,500
Two people can't have
the same number, man.

398
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,333
I can't imagine what would've
happened if I was a bit late.

399
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,417
So, you think you saved me
or something?

400
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,501
Of course.

401
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,542
I was going to jump.

402
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,417
But this text
messed with my brain.

403
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,834
I should find out
who this girl is.

404
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,460
You're here.

405
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,667
What's her condition?

406
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,500
‐They just shifted her from the ICU.
‐Move! Give way!

407
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,917
‐She's doing fine now.
‐Move!

408
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,542
Move! Give way!

409
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,000
‐Wait.
‐Please wait outside.

410
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,959
This place really scares me.

411
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Careful.

412
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,875
Dad went down.
Said he'll be right back.

413
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,542
Madam, out. This way.

414
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,500
‐Put him in observation for 6 hours.
‐Okay, sir.

415
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,041
‐Call me if anything's up.
‐All right.

416
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,042
What happened?

417
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,375
Suicide case. He downed
a bottle of sleeping pills.

418
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,291
Oh, no. What went wrong?

419
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,500
Love failure apparently.

420
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:01,875
Alas! Kids and
their hasty decisions.

421
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,083
Hello.

422
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,291
How long will you keep me waiting?

423
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,708
I've been asking the same question
since an hour.

424
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,668
How can you give the same number
to two people?

425
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,792
Hi! How are you doing?

426
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,291
Are you fricking blind?

427
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,291
I was just making small talk.

428
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,291
First, answer my question.

429
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:24,667
All right, ask.

430
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:26,291
How can you give it to two people?

431
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
How?

432
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:28,792
I get it.

433
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,333
But I broke up with Praveen.

434
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,166
I'm not a fool to believe
whatever you say.

435
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,959
I have your chat history
from last night.

436
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,041
No, Surya.

437
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,834
I'll mess up your image on social
media if you try to convince me.

438
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,375
Sir, when will you give me
my 500 bucks?

439
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,041
‐Sorry.
‐Get lost. I didn't get my salary yet.

440
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,959
What?

441
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,583
‐I have nothing more to say.
‐Huh?

442
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,625
What happened to her?

443
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,864
You were yelling
at the customer care guy,

444
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:53,333
and she thought it's for her.

445
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:56,083
Girls are like ice cream.
You should handle them smoothly.

446
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,542
They get easily hurt for anything.

447
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,418
She looks fine.

448
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,208
I'm neither interested
nor desperate.

449
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,667
I still can't figure out how Vennela
and I can have the same number.

450
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,291
Are you still obsessing over that?

451
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,041
I mean, how is it even possible?

452
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,542
There's this friend of mine.

453
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,750
When he has no company,
he plays cards from both sides.

454
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,875
Are you saying I'm sending
these texts to myself?

455
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,875
Without a doubt.
What do you call her?

456
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,125
I didn't give her a name.
She told me it's Vennela.

457
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:20,542
Nice choice.

458
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,834
"Hi, Vennela.
Will you come for a date?"

459
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,417
Why did you say it's a date?

460
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:25,750
She'll get offended.

461
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,875
Oh. You'll get offended
if I don't reply.

462
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,417
‐What do I say?
‐Don't mess with my feelings, dude.

463
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,959
‐I'll push you off the building.
‐Yeah, right.

464
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,333
First, you try jumping last night.
Now you want to push me.

465
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,792
Why did you go downstairs
last night?

466
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,542
‐I went to the rooftop.
‐Yes. But why?

467
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,250
‐To jump.
‐I see it now.

468
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,291
You must've gotten drunk
and texted yourself.

469
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,291
You're Surya by day
and Vennela at night.

470
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,417
If Vennela existed,
she'd have replied by now.

471
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:46,708
You think I'm going crazy?

472
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,166
Should we visit a doctor?

473
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,500
First, let's meet our boss.
He's waiting in the conference hall.

474
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,917
Didn't I tell you?
Nobody's on time.

475
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Not even the boss.

476
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,041
What are you doing
in the dark, boss?

477
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,125
I thought you quit.

478
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,166
I had a dream that
you apologised to me.

479
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,000
‐What?
‐That is why I came back.

480
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,125
You continue.

481
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:13,875
Which page?

482
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, my god! 261!

483
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:20,500
Unless we come up with something
other than fun‐filled shows,

484
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:21,917
our TRPs are not going up.

485
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:23,792
So, we all have to work hard, okay?

486
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,083
That's when we can beat our rivals.

487
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,500
Did she reply?

488
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,083
Why are you banging your head?

489
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,959
Why don't you give us a concept?

490
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,166
Sir, I have something new.

491
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:36,291
PDA by youth at coffee shops,
bars, metro lifts,

492
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,917
and cinema halls is quite common.

493
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:44,000
Some make out in daylight
without any fear.

494
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,834
If we shoot this secretively
and telecast a 2‐hour program,

495
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,208
our TRPs will peak.

496
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,792
We shouldn't give
the public space to think.

497
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,041
What do you want to call it?

498
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,708
<i>Pulihora: The Youth Mixture.</i>

499
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,376
Clap.

500
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,166
You said something
about space earlier.

501
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,708
Space, sir. The space.

502
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,375
Come here.

503
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,166
<i>Is he going to hug?
I didn't brush today.</i>

504
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:03,625
Yes, sir?

505
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,750
Your writings. Read it.

506
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,250
"Blowing."

507
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,000
‐Blow what?
‐Nothing sir.

508
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,041
I forgot to add "winds," sir.

509
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,875
I forgot to add space
between the words.

510
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,083
Read next.

511
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,500
"Fire is‐‐"

512
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,583
Stop!

513
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,875
Stop right there.
Did you say all the words?

514
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,500
‐Did you add space this time?
‐No, sir.

515
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,291
‐Next.
‐It's okay, sir. Let's stop.

516
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,333
I don't mind. Go on.

517
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,708
"The slut is..."

518
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,083
"The slot is open."

519
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,375
That should be it.

520
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:44,125
Quit your crappy ideas
and learn to spell first.

521
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,291
Go away!

522
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,625
You want the salary on time, eh?

523
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,542
Why didn't she reply, dude?

524
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,750
Come up with nice concepts.

525
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:56,875
‐You said that last night.
‐I have surprise gifts for you.

526
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,710
‐I can't believe she didn't reply.
‐So, better get your A‐game on.

527
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,501
Hey! How many times
do I have to tell you?

528
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,834
‐She'll not reply. Forget her.
‐She will!

529
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,166
Would we get TRPs this way?

530
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,250
Why would we?

531
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,250
‐Hit me hard if we do.
‐Hey!

532
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,875
If that happens,
I'll get everybody's heads shaved!

533
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,333
Annoying the shit out of me.

534
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,918
Sorry, sir.

535
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,083
Hi, man.

536
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,291
My boss can't function without me.

537
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,708
‐Mom.
‐Hmm?

538
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,001
‐I have a small doubt.
‐Tell me.

539
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,375
Do you think I'll turn into you
if I get married?

540
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,750
Not a chance!

541
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,708
‐He would die if he marries me.
‐Whatever. Let's go downstairs.

542
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,875
"Hi, Vennela.
Will you come for a date?"

543
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:50,583
I want each one of you to come up
with at least 2 ideas.

544
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Surya.

545
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,042
I got a message, sir.

546
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,959
‐Messages again.
‐Hey!

547
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,625
Is that idiot calling you out?

548
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,542
You think this is a school?
Get out!

549
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,875
‐Hey, where's Prasad?
‐He left, sir.

550
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,625
His phone's off.

551
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:16,376
<i>You pig! You're so full of crap.</i>

552
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,625
<i>How dare you ask me out on a date!
You jobless idiot!</i>

553
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,708
<i>Hey, shit‐face!</i>

554
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,708
<i>I didn't send that text.
My friend did.</i>

555
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:26,625
<i>Oh! If I said yes, then you would've
said that you sent the message?</i>

556
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,125
<i>Who'd go on a date
with a crazy girl like you?</i>

557
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:30,542
<i>You poop‐face!</i>

558
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,543
<i>Do you know
how many go crazy about me?</i>

559
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,291
<i>Dogs, I suppose. I know.</i>

560
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,291
<i>You ass! I'll tell the cops
if you send these texts again.</i>

561
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:40,959
<i>Sure. Remember
we have the same number.</i>

562
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,750
<i>Let me see whose house
the cops will end up at.</i>

563
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,041
<i>How are you even texting me
from my number?</i>

564
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,083
<i>That's my question too.</i>

565
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,333
<i>How are you doing it, you devil?</i>

566
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:52,083
<i>If you text me again,
I'll disfigure your face.</i>

567
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,333
<i>Yeah!
I've been so waiting for that.</i>

568
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:58,250
<i>Just shut up!
I'll never reply to you, loser.</i>

569
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,125
<i>Hey, please, please, please reply.</i>

570
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,834
<i>I can't hold in the swear words.</i>

571
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,125
<i>Come, let's fight.</i>

572
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,917
<i>Why don't you gulp some acid?
Good riddance!</i>

573
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,250
<i>Hey! Thank you for your advice.
Get lost!</i>

574
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,583
<i>Get this.
I'll never text you again.</i>

575
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,500
Thank god!
I don't want you to text me either.

576
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,583
There have been so many
phone call cross connections.

577
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,458
Do you think
it's a network problem?

578
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,583
No, no, no.

579
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,834
It's is not a network problem.

580
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,625
We faced the same issue
five years back in 2014.

581
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,625
People were as confused
if not more.

582
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,041
What do you call this phenomenon?

583
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:30,291
It's called a Solar Flare Effect.

584
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:35,041
When there's a high voltage,
all the lights burn bright, right?

585
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,959
Similarly, the sun also
burns bright sometimes.

586
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,625
That's when these solar flares
are generated.

587
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:44,250
They disturb the short waves
in our atmosphere.

588
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:48,375
Radio transmissions
and telecommunication signals

589
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,917
are disturbed, leading to this.

590
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,125
Sir, I have a doubt.

591
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:56,625
You just spoke about
cross connections.

592
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,250
But, is it possible for two people
to interact using the same number?

593
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,126
How can that happen?

594
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,041
Service providers decide
the number, right?

595
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,166
I spoke to them, sir.

596
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:05,750
They have no clue.

597
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,417
Maybe they really have no clue.

598
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:11,041
If two frequencies mismatch
due to a solar flare,

599
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:18,166
two people could interact from the
same number due to magnetic anomaly.

600
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,625
But that's a very, very,
very rare case.

601
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:25,000
Sir, is this science or
some supernatural power?

602
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:29,083
Progress of science
in the world is only

603
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,000
as much as the light emitted
from a candle.

604
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:37,959
Many secrets are hidden
in the darkness around it.

605
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,583
Let's see how far we can go.

606
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,041
The more we dig, the more
we realise that we know nothing.

607
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:50,792
Hello. You just got discharged
and you're already tiring yourself?

608
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:54,667
One goes to Mt. Kailash if they die
chanting Lord Rama's name.

609
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,291
It's like buying a ticket to Vizag
and boarding a Mumbai train.

610
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,542
Why will you go to Mt. Kailash
if you chant Lord Rama's name?

611
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,583
You should chant Lord Shiva's name
if you want to go to Mr. Kailash.

612
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,250
‐Don't you know that?
‐I do.

613
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,959
Are you teaching me the epics
I taught you?

614
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:10,750
Shiva and Vishnu are one entity.

615
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:11,917
That's the matter.

616
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,792
If you speak logic,

617
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,542
she'll quote some holy verse
and confuse us.

618
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,250
We don't know any holy verse.

619
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,500
Which chapter
are you teaching in <i>Ramayana</i>?

620
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,166
With the clue Jatayu
gave in Ashokavanam,

621
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:27,208
Lord Rama found that
Sita was in Lanka.

622
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:34,333
So, hero Rama found out where
villain Ravan hid heroine Sita.

623
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,917
Wow! What a thriller!

624
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,417
My foot!

625
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,333
This is not a movie.
It's mythology, you fool.

626
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,417
Whatever it is, I just want them
to understand it.

627
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:48,375
Goddess Sita was gloomy,
thinking about Lord Rama.

628
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,501
What happened?

629
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:55,083
She wanted to leave her body
as she was worried.

630
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,250
What do you mean?

631
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,792
I wanted to commit suicide.

632
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,083
You?

633
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,917
No. Sita.

634
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,667
Who saved her?

635
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,333
‐The message.
‐Correct.

636
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,458
What message?

637
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,083
The ring Rama sent was the message.

638
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:12,208
He asked her to be strong
by sending it across.

639
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:16,959
Maruti delivered the message to Sita,
and she was worried no more.

640
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,625
In fact, she hoped for life.

641
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,875
Grandma...

642
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,250
what if the message never came?

643
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,583
It would come definitely.

644
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,375
Or else, the story
wouldn't move forward.

645
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,750
Your story shouldn't stop here.

646
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,458
You shouldn't make foolish decisions
out of fear or anger.

647
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:38,875
Nature warns you that
you have a lot to accomplish.

648
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,125
Tell me, dear.

649
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,667
Can <i>Ramayana</i> exist
without Goddess Sita?

650
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:52,500
You think getting me drunk
will make me believe your stories?

651
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,000
No, uncle. Look, I got the text.

652
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,708
I got the cyber department
to check it.

653
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,834
Uncle, don't listen to him.

654
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:02,875
You'll end up in deep shit
if you do.

655
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,750
You don't want to lose your job,
do you?

656
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,375
‐But I know‐‐
‐Hello?

657
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,041
Just a second.

658
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,542
Uncle, check the message and go.

659
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,875
Go, go.
You're not helping here anyway.

660
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,958
I swear, dude.

661
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,125
She shut up when I countered her.

662
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,708
Did she shut up?

663
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:18,917
‐Yeah.
‐Okay. Do one thing.

664
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,792
Give her a peg.
She'll shut up forever.

665
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,083
Idiot!

666
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,920
If you don't shut up,

667
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:25,708
I'll write a suicide note
blaming you and Vennela,

668
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,417
then mix poison in my drink
and die.

669
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,083
‐I swear, dude.
‐Hold on.

670
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,001
Hey!

671
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,000
‐Leave me! I'll go home.
‐Hey!

672
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,125
There's drunk‐and‐drive check.
Let's walk home.

673
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,668
Idiot.

674
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,750
Hello?

675
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,001
Hi.

676
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,834
Oh, I didn't know
we could call each other also.

677
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:01,542
‐Thank you.
‐For what?

678
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,041
I was trying to commit suicide
when you first texted me.

679
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,959
But your text stopped that.

680
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,125
Thanks for saving my life, I guess.

681
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,375
Try again.
I won't text you this time.

682
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,542
Looks like you're still angry
with me.

683
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:18,083
You also texted me when I was
trying to jump off a building.

684
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,417
Oh! So, I also helped you.

685
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,667
Return my thanks.

686
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,708
Nobody would care if I die or live.

687
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,291
So, no thanks.

688
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,792
Oh! I'm just realising this, Surya.

689
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:32,041
We assume we could die
and kill our pain.

690
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,000
But we only pass it on
to a few others.

691
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:38,500
Suicide is not the permanent
solution to temporary problems.

692
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,667
And sorry.

693
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:42,792
What's this for?

694
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,583
I cussed at you really badly.

695
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,875
‐Then I'm really sorry.
‐Why?

696
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,458
I cussed you pretty badly too.

697
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,333
Really? What did you say?

698
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:53,583
Idiot, fool, shit‐face.
Let's not talk about it.

699
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,500
They'd have to bleep
the real cuss words.

700
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,250
You call these cuss words?

701
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,458
Mine sound better.

702
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,292
So, what do you do?

703
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,959
I smile and talk about
people's sins and scams.

704
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,750
TV reporter?

705
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,917
‐Y TV.
‐Y TV?

706
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,542
I still have the same reaction
to that channel.

707
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,583
What about you?

708
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,708
I try really hard and fail.

709
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,959
Been trying to crack GET
for 3 years.

710
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,166
What? The same exam for 3 years?

711
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,417
Where are you from, dear?

712
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:22,875
Hello!
I'll definitely crack it someday.

713
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,375
I was being serious.

714
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:27,792
Which city are you from?

715
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:28,959
Why?

716
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,583
Just wondering
how far apart we are.

717
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,917
I don't intend to move closer.

718
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,333
We don't have to meet,
but our cities could.

719
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,375
Mine's Hyderabad.

720
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,834
Hyderabad's not mine,

721
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,542
but I'm from here too.

722
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,583
‐Such a funny man!
‐Thanks.

723
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:53,625
We... got each other's messages

724
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,000
when we both were
about to commit suicide.

725
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,333
That too from the same number.

726
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,917
Why do you think
this is happening to us?

727
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:03,875
I don't know.

728
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,667
Maybe life gave us a second chance.

729
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,000
Why don't we give life a chance
this time?

730
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,166
What say?

731
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,667
‐Are you there?
‐Hmm.

732
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:15,335
I'll be there.

733
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,208
<i>"Hello, Mr. Wrong Call"</i>

734
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,291
<i>"Where do you live?"</i>

735
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,083
<i>"You claim to be a smart girl"</i>

736
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,583
<i>"Why don't you figure it out?"</i>

737
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,458

00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,750
<i>"What's your age and size?"</i>

740
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,125
<i>"Give me the details, girl"</i>

741
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,708
"Sorry. Not size."

742
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,000
"Tell me your age
and college name."

743
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:03,500
"You rascal! I'll block you
if you talk like this!"

744
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,291
"I'll kill you. Got it?"

745
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:10,834
<i>"Sorry, sorry, sorry
That reminds me"</i>

746

Do you use Fair & Lovely?"</i>

747
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:20,166
"Hey! How can you be so rapist?"

748
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:24,166
"What? Rapist? Hello!
I'm not that type!"

749
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:28,583
"Sorry. That was autotyped."

750
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,750
<i>"I wonder how he looks"</i>

751
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,917
<i>"Will he be my friend
Or end up being fake?"</i>

752
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,375
<i>"I wonder how she is"</i>

753
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,708
<i>"Is it really a girl
Or is somebody catfishing me?"</i>

754
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,750
<i>"How did this even happen?"</i>

755
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:46,917
<i>"Will it work out
Or just remain a dream?"</i>

756
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,000
<i>"How did she come into my life?"</i>

757
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,750
<i>"Will she be honest or cheat me?"</i>

00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,125
<i>"Stop texting her, dude!"</i>

762
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:11,376
‐Surya, I have an amazing idea.
<i>‐What's that?</i>

763
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,959
There were no phones once upon
a time. People wrote letters.

764
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,125
<i>What do you call them?</i>

765
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,667
‐Pen friends.
‐Right. Pen friends.

766
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,333
Let's be phone friends.

767
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,542
<i>What say?</i>

768
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:22,875
<i>But a few conditions.</i>

769
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:27,125
We can't meet or see each other.

770
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,917
Let's just talk and text. Okay?

771
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:32,792
It's an old concept...

772
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:34,751
But it's new.

773
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:37,333
<i>"Both tried to kill themselves"</i>

774
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,875
<i>"One due to pain
And other due to self‐respect"</i>

775
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:43,667
<i>"God laid back
And rejected your attempt"</i>

776
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:48,959
<i>"They started interacting
With the same number"</i>

777
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:57,041
<i>"This is surely magical
Not a dream, I swear"</i>

778
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,750
<i>"They're getting to know each other"</i>

779
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,041
<i>"Having dreams of their own"</i>

780
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,500
<i>"What's going on here?"</i>

781
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,340
<i>"Love is in the air"</i>

782
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:09,166
<i>"Love is in the air, for sure"</i>

783
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,542
<i>"This goes on all day and night"</i>

784
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:30,417

785
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,375
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

786
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:37,708

00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:45,250
<i>"Are you moving
Forward or backwards?"</i>

00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,166
<i>"What's his name and city?"</i>

790
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,750
<i>"What the hell is going on?"</i>

791
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,834
‐Don't confess your feelings?
‐Why?

792
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,625
Once you say you love each other,
it's game over.

793
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,166
Your life will get boring
like mine.

794
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:19,500
They'll chase us
only until we say yes.

795
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:20,917
Trust me.

796
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,667
Enjoy this feeling for a few days.

797
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Are you listening?

798
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,834
‐We're just friends, okay?
‐Oh!

799
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,500
Hey, Divya, don't cry.

800
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,166
We'll do something about him.

801
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,083
Calm down.

802
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,542
Why is she crying?

803
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,166
Don't care. She's a crybaby.
Let's go.

804
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:43,959
Hold on.

805
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:45,959
Let's check on her.

806
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,083
What's wrong?
Did somebody die?

807
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,166
Why are you so down?

808
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,208
He cheated on me.

809
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,000
‐Are you pregnant?
‐Hell no!

810
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,458
All right then.
What happened?

811
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,625
We've been chatting online
for a year now.

812
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,125
Initially, he said
we're just friends.

813
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:03,792
I agreed.

814
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:08,708
Look at her. Then?

815
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,625
A few days later,

816
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:17,083
I gave him Rs. 50,000
for my sister‐in‐law's wedding.

817
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,750
It doesn't make sense.

818
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,041
His sister becomes
my sister‐in‐law, right?

819
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,917
You idiot! I'm going to kill you!

820
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,083
Stop! No! Don't!

821
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,083
What can I say? I fell in love.

822
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,166
Hey, stop!

823
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,834
‐Do you even know how he looks?
‐No.

824
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,917
‐But you sent him the money.
‐Yes.

825
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,125
Idiot!

826
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:40,417
How can you become friends
and love him without knowing him?

827
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,458
‐Huh.
‐Hmm.

828
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:57,750
The weather report suggests
heavy winds due to a cyclone.

829
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,041
That's all for the day.
Keep watching Y News.

830
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,875
Let's meet?

831
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:13,834
This guy...

832
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:16,917
‐Hello.
‐Hey.

833
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,208
I was going to call you.

834
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,041
I need a small favour.
I know.

835
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:21,333
That's your next step, right?

836
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:22,917
Step? What are you saying?

837
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:24,333
You know staircases, don't you?

838
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:28,000
Oops, I'm sorry. You're the kind
that takes the elevator.

839
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,542
‐I didn't get you.
‐But I'm pretty clear.

840
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:32,125
So, you want to meet?

841
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,792
I thought some conditions applied.

842
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:35,083
Clearly you weren't listening.

843
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,375
Conditions applied are
subjected to market risks.

844
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:39,500
<i>Meet me at clock tower.
5 p.m. sharp.</i>

845
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,750
Okay.

846
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,625
Surya, I've been meaning
to tell you something.

847
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:46,460
I love you, man.

848
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,208
How much money do you need?
‐Rs. 3,000.

849
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,542
‐Okay, come with me.
‐To the ATM?

850
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:50,708
‐No, clock tower.
‐What for?

851
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,250
Vennela called me.
She wants to meet.

852
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,250
Oh, shit!

853
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,375
I made peace with your belief that
you guys are texting and talking.

854
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,583
Now you say you're meeting her.
You've gone mad.

855
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,208
I'm worried about why she called.
Come with me, please.

856
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,458
It's Valentine's Day.
Maybe she wants to confess her love.

857
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:04,542
You think so?

858
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:06,917
Are you sure?

859
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,125
Don't overact.
You're not a child actor anymore.

860
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,750
You're all grown up now.
Act mature.

861
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:12,166
‐Are you coming or not?
‐No.

862
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,417
Unlike you, I'm not crazy.

863
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,625
Mr. Aravind, I love you 3,000.

864
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,333
<i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

865
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:43,041
‐Hello.
‐I'm also here.

866
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,083
Where exactly?

867
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:46,417
On the yellow bench.

868
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:47,959
Yellow bench?

869
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,625
‐How many yellow benches are here?
‐Only one.

870
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,125
If we're sitting on the same bench,
why aren't you beside me?

871
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,208
You're not beside me either.

872
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,917
Are you really here?
Are you lying?

873
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:03,250
Hey! Why would I lie? I'm here.

874
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:04,667
I'm also here.

875
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,375
You're definitely lying.

876
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,500
I know you're not here.

877
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,417
Are you in Hyderabad, India
or Hyderabad, Pakistan?

878
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,041
Vennela, stop kidding
and come fast.

879
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:16,625
The wind's blowing heavily.

880
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:17,625
What?

881
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,541
Who the hell are you?

882
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,375
It's 40 degrees here,
and you're saying it's windy?

883
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,375
What! Vennela?

884
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,792
You cheat!

885
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,208
<i>‐Hello!</i>
‐I see it clearly now.

886
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,083
Are you out of your mind?
Where are you?

887
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,125
Just shut up!

888
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,583
You're a cheater.

889
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:43,041
Actually, I should blame myself
for trusting you blindly.

890
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:44,625
Just get lost!

891
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:46,583
I shouldn't have shown up,
damn it!

892
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,667
Rascal! Useless fellow!

893
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,792
How could you trust him?

894
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,517
HELLO!! WHERE ARE YOU???

895
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:07,917
YOU CRAZY WOMAN! IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO COME, WHY DID YOU CALL ME?

896
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:20,959
Hello.

897
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:23,667
What? You want money now?

898
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,291
Why are you talking about money?

899
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,417
Have you lost your mind?

900
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,166
You kept me waiting for so long.
Why didn't you come?

901
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:29,166
I'll kill you.

902
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,375
I was there, you idiot.
You didn't show up.

903
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,959
I didn't show up? Do you know
how long I waited in the storm?

904
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,792
Say storm one more time...

905
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,875
All right. Stay on line.

906
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,583
Listen to this.

907
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,041
‐Hear that?
‐Hey...

908
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,834
keep your phone away from the fan.

909
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,333
It's really the wind.

910
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,917
Oh, really?
Hold on then.

911
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,041
Listen to this.

912
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,291
‐Heard that?
‐I didn't hear anything.

913
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,083
Because it's not windy
in Hyderabad.

914
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:01,583
You're lying
because you're a cheater.

915
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,667
Turn on the TV. Watch
what's become of the roads.

916
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,166
Oh, yeah?

917
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,375
Hold on.

918
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,291
‐Do you see it?
‐Yeah!

919
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:20,125
OU students are protesting
in the Telangana agitation.

920
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,917
Does that look windy to you?

921
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,083
Telangana agitation?
Why now?

922
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:26,333
For a separate state, of course.

923
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:29,875
Separate state?
What are you talking about?

924
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:33,166
It's been 5 years since Telangana
became a separate state.

925
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,375
What?

926
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,500
Who made that happen? You?

927
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,792
Don't joke, Vennela.

928
00:47:37,917 --> 00:47:41,208
It became a separate State
on February 18th, 2014.

929
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,333
They've been protesting
since 10 years.

930
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:45,959
Are you going to make it happen
in the next 4 days?

931
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,458
What? 4 days?

932
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,750
‐What's today's date?
‐February 14th.

933
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:53,585
Year?

934
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:57,417
February 14th, 2014.

935
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,166
2014.

936
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:08,792
‐Seriously?
‐Surya, stop fooling around.

937
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,792
Don't try to cheat me anymore.

938
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:12,291
Don't ever call me, okay?

939
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,291
Seems like science fiction
to me, sir.

940
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:13,291
Science invented cinema, didn't it?

941
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:18,625
People have communicated
from the past before too.

942
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,291
Really? Where?

943
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:21,417
In Russia.

944
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:26,229
People in 2015
started hearing voices

945
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:31,291
from a radio station in 1982.

946
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:32,333
Look.

947
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,083
Some idiot must be fooling them
from the radio station.

948
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:54,166
That station's been shut
for 30 years.

949
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,291
What?

950
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:56,917
And the voices?

951
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,250
They came from the past.

952
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,333
But they didn't know
who was sending them.

953
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,251
Wait, wait.

954
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:07,083
Are you saying we are hearing voices
from someone in the 1980s?

955
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:08,375
Exactly!

956
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,375
Maybe it's a ghost's work, sir.

957
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:14,041
That's what they said when
Graham Bell invented the telephone.

958
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:18,875
Recently, in Canada,
1.5 billion light years away,

959
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:20,834
they received light signals
from the future.

960
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:23,166
They're called FRBs.

961
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,834
Fast Radio Bursts.

962
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,708
We don't know who's sending them.

963
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:31,917
Past‐to‐future,
future‐to‐past communications

964
00:50:31,959 --> 00:50:33,001
like these keep happening.

965
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,125
How is this possible, sir?

966
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,291
Sometimes, few things
go beyond science, Surya.

967
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,208
It wouldn't be called
a miracle otherwise.

968
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,917
Something is magical
only until we figure it out.

969
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,500
When you crack the logic,
it becomes ordinary.

970
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:45,834
Like this mobile phone.

971
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:50,500
The science of today
is the technology of tomorrow.

972
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,208
I need to tell you something.

973
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:01,792
Tell me.

974
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,500
‐There are too many people here.
‐Hold on!

975
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,166
Hold on.

976
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:09,168
Hello, uncle.

977
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,000
Your daughter's on a date
with some guy here in Somajiguda.

978
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,208
Come catch her in the act.

979
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,417
What the hell, man!
Hey! Aren't you too old for dating?

980
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:21,583
Hey, what's this, man?

981
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:23,166
Society is so spoiled.

982
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,333
Damn! You continue.

983
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,041
I know where Vennela is.

984
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,708
‐Where is she?
‐Really far away.

985
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,041
Hayathnagar or Choutuppal?

986
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,417
2014.

987
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:38,375
Is it a door number?
Which area?

988
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:40,125
Vennela is 5 years behind us.

989
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:42,458
Is he nuts?

990
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,834
You mean, in the past?

991
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:47,125
Yes, dude. She's in 2014.

992
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:48,291
I'm in 2019.

993
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:51,083
Both of us are able to talk via
mobile phones from here to there.

994
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,750
I've watched films like
<i>Aditya 369</i> and <i>24</i>.

995
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:55,542
That scientist
also spoke about this.

996
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,667
Don't tell me
she's in love with you.

997
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:00,710
I'm not sure.

998
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,208
So, according to your delusion,
there's this girl in 2014.

999
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,125
She's in love with you,
but you can't meet her

1000
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,250
because you can't go back.

1001
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,500
Do you know
where she is in 2019?

1002
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:11,834
You don't know.

1003
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:13,500
This is the most complicated,

1004
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,667
unrealistic, hypothetical
love story of the century.

1005
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:17,250
‐Go to hell!
‐Hey!

1006
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:18,667
Where are you going?

1007
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:20,583
You live in the past.
I'll stay in the present.

1008
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,042
I can't ruin my future
because of you.

1009
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,083
‐Listen‐‐
‐Get lost!

1010
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,084
Bill.

1011
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,834
Do you have to meet him?

1012
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,542
Dad insisted. I can't help it.

1013
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,375
Get him another one.

1014
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,542
Who the hell is this?

1015
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:45,708
He just took it, dude.

1016
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,750
‐Make one more.
‐What will you serve them?

1017
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,083
He's looks scary.

1018
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,375
Hi, Venny.

1019
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,166
Vennela.

1020
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,041
Hey, cool down.

1021
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:58,208
‐So, you wanted to see me?
‐What?

1022
00:52:58,291 --> 00:52:59,625
Dad told me you wanted to see me.

1023
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:02,375
‐Oh, that's what he told you?
‐Yeah.

1024
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:05,708
Maybe he wants us to get to know
each other before marriage.

1025
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:09,667
Now that you're here,
just have your coffee and leave.

1026
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:13,166
If you crack lame jokes,
I'll have you beaten up.

1027
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:16,291
She doesn't act like a girl at all.

1028
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:17,792
It's all lies!

1029
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:19,291
Oh, lies.

1030
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:20,877
I told you.

1031
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:21,959
When did you tell me?

1032
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:23,959
Oh...

1033
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,375
It was blazing hot,
and he says it's windy.

1034
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,500
Impossible! See.

1035
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:34,708
I was a fool to trust him.

1036
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:36,959
I couldn't stop crying
for 4 days.

1037
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:40,000
Hey, Venny...
You could've just called me.

1038
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,876
‐Who's talking to you, dude?
‐It's okay.

1039
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:44,667
You know he's a cheater. Move on.

1040
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,500
Hello. Excuse me.

1041
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:48,417
But I like that idiot.

1042
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,625
Love you too.

1043
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,417
Here's another idiot,
bothering me about marriage.

1044
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,250
<i>Hail Telangana! Hail Telangana!</i>

1045
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:57,041
What? Did they make
Telangana a separate state?

1046
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:58,625
That's what's showing on TV, man.

1047
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,583
‐Is this true?
<i>‐Hail Telangana!</i>

1048
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:02,750
Hey, is this true?

1049
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,000
Is the state separated?

1050
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:06,209
Is it confirmed?

1051
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,583
Don't kid with me, buddy.

1052
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,379
<i>Celebrations in Hyderabad
on the passing</i>

1053
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:43,375
<i>of Telangana's bill
in the Rajya Sabha.</i>

1054
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,875
Are you going to make it happen
in the next 4 days?

1055
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,083
How did he know beforehand?

1056
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,083
I don't know.

1057
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:33,041
‐Hello.
‐Hello.

1058
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:34,750
‐Hello, Surya.
<i>‐Yes?</i>

1059
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,250
How are you doing this, Surya?

1060
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:38,291
Sister!

1061
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:39,583
Hail Telangana!

1062
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:41,834
Is Telangana formed?

1063
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,083
Yes.

1064
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,333
How is this happening?

1065
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,458
Because 2014 is my past.

1066
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,375
I need proof, Surya.

1067
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,458
I can't believe this.

1068
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:53,875
I need a proof right now!

1069
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,750
Why this place?

1070
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,375
Are you at the bench?

1071
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,041
I sat down.

1072
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,458
Which side?

1073
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,000
Right. Why?

1074
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:10,750
I sat on your left.

1075
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:15,000
Everything is happening
just like you said.

1076
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,291
Like a miracle.

1077
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,250
I didn't believe it either, but‐‐

1078
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,000
Can you give me another proof?

1079
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,667
There are scientific proofs.

1080
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:26,000
But you'd just get confused.

1081
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:28,792
I remember!

1082
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:31,501
<i>Manam</i> movie released
in 2014. It was a superhit.

1083
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:33,959
But it's releasing in May, Surya.
This is February.

1084
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:37,333
Modi's government wins
the elections in 2014.

1085
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:39,375
Kolkata Knight Riders win
the T20 cup.

1086
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,417
That's all in the future for me.

1087
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,375
Elections and IPL
haven't happened yet.

1088
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,083
Say something else, Surya.

1089
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,542
What other proof do you need?

1090
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:48,834
Tell me what happened today.

1091
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,667
Other than the Telangana bill
being passed,

1092
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:53,166
tell me what happened today.
Right here.

1093
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,126
Are you mad?

1094
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,166
How would I know what happened
5 years ago?

1095
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,917
I'm telling you
whatever I remember.

1096
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,583
I can only tell you
what happened in the past.

1097
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,500
Wait, wait, wait.

1098
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,959
You can tell
what happened in the past.

1099
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:04,417
‐Am I right?
‐Yes.

1100
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,750
Yes. So what?

1101
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,250
<i>Wait, wait. Hold on.</i>

1102
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:10,500
‐What are you doing?
‐Hold on. I'll tell you.

1103
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:12,959
What are you up to?

1104
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,166
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

1105
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:16,834
What?

1106
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:22,333
<i>Look to your left.</i>

1107
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,500
<i>To your left. On the bench.</i>

1108
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:29,542
<i>Do you see it?</i>

1109
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,334
MIRACLE

1110
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:47,834
Miracle.

1111
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:12,834
Dear...

1112
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,625
Get up. Eat your food.

1113
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,708
‐Get up.
‐I don't want anything.

1114
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,583
I don't want to eat, grandma.

1115
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,625
Don't be upset with me
because he did something.

1116
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,750
What did he do?

1117
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,834
What's upsetting you then?

1118
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:26,625
He's 5 years ahead.

1119
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:28,875
Whoa! 5 years ahead!

1120
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:31,125
I've read about it in the epics.

1121
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,792
I didn't know
it could really happen.

1122
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:33,792
It's true, grandma.

1123
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:37,417
‐I swear to you.
‐Maybe he's foresighted.

1124
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:40,250
Maybe he didn't want to meet you.

1125
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,291
‐I'll kill you!
‐Oh, no! Don't.

1126
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,625
I won't say a thing.
What do you want to do now?

1127
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,792
‐I'll forget him.
‐Do that. Very good.

1128
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:50,583
‐I'll forget him.
‐You'll forget him.

1129
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:52,750
‐You think I can't?
‐You can.

1130
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,500
I forgot him.

1131
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:57,250
I don't know who Surya is anymore.

1132
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,417
My sweetheart.

1133
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,125
‐Here eat this.
‐I don't want to.

1134
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:06,875
If you eat, I'll give you an idea
to meet Surya.

1135
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,166
‐Tell me.
‐You just said you forgot him.

1136
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:13,084
‐Don't you?
‐Grandma!

1137
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:16,625
‐Well, you say he's in 2019.
‐Yes.

1138
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:20,875
So, he must've had to pass
through 2014.

1139
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:25,708
He wouldn't have appeared
out of the blue in 2019.

1140
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:27,126
You mean?

1141
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:33,834
I mean he should be somewhere
around us here in 2014.

1142
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:35,375
‐I know, right?
‐Yes.

1143
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,333
Ask him for his address
and meet him now.

1144
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,792
Also, give him your address.

1145
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,667
He'll go meet you in 2019.

1146
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:46,667
Grandma, you're just amazing.

1147
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,375
‐Crazy girl!
‐I'm going.

1148
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,083
‐Be careful.
‐Okay, okay. Bye, bye.

1149
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:54,291
Now?

1150
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,708
Turn left.

1151
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:57,041
Then turn right.

1152
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
<i>And then right again.</i>

1153
00:59:58,708 --> 00:59:59,792
<i>And then take left.</i>

1154
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,625
I could just go straight.

1155
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:03,875
Correct, correct.

1156
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:07,041
Just go straight
and take the third left.

1157
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,125
I'm at that place
you told me about.

1158
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:15,208
<i>There will be a pan shop
to your left.</i>

1159
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:16,875
It's closed. Is that okay?

1160
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,583
What does it matter whether
it is closed or opened?

1161
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:21,166
<i>Just go right.</i>

1162
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:23,750
Did you?

1163
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,500
Yeah, I did. Now?

1164
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,875
<i>Just go a little ahead.
Third house on the left.</i>

1165
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,583
‐ <i>Black gate.</i>
‐Third house, black gate.

1166
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:33,208
<i>‐Yes!</i>
‐Almost there.

1167
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:40,834
Is this address correct?

1168
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,333
I'm right in front of the temple.

1169
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,000
Right beside that.
A green‐coloured gate.

1170
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,000
<i>Do you see it? Hello?</i>

1171
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,917
<i>Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

1172
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:53,208
<i>Did my dad see you?</i>

1173
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:56,834
Your house isn't here.
It is KLM fashion mall.

1174
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,500
A mall? Huh?

1175
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:01,166
How come?
Did you miss our house?

1176
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,500
Your dad must've sold the house.

1177
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,333
You're right. He would have.

1178
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,375
Did you find my house?

1179
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:08,583
I guess.

1180
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:10,542
Black gate. But it's locked.

1181
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,750
Where did you go?

1182
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,083
<i>I must have gone out of town.</i>

1183
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:14,667
Are you kidding me?

1184
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,291
Why didn't you tell me
before this?

1185
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:18,083
Which city do you think I went to?

1186
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:20,000
How do we meet?

1187
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,834
I think our meeting is not
as easy as our phone calls.

1188
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,667
What do we do?

1189
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:26,083
I'm not at my house.

1190
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:27,500
Your house is not here.

1191
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,625
‐Let's do one thing.
‐What?

1192
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,000
Let's try tomorrow again.

1193
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:33,375
‐Not tomorrow.
<i>‐Why?</i>

1194
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,583
It's my birthday tomorrow.

1195
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:36,667
Oh! Then what about the treat?

1196
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:38,542
‐Will you come?
‐What?

1197
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,792
How can I come?

1198
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:41,877
<i>Idea!</i>

1199
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:44,708
<i>Do we go to the same place
in different years? Interesting.</i>

1200
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,625
<i>"What's with this distance?"</i>

1201
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,208
<i>"Why can't we come closer?"</i>

1202
01:01:57,917 --> 01:02:02,875
<i>"Two different paths intersect"</i>

1203
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:08,125
<i>"But it's invisible
To the naked eye"</i>

1204
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,917
<i>"Time weaves some magic"</i>

1205
01:02:13,834 --> 01:02:18,542
<i>"I feel
Like I've seen you already"</i>

1206
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:24,458
<i>"My feet freeze
At the place you are"</i>

1207
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:27,583
<i>"Planets are finally in our favour"</i>

1208
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:30,166
<i>"My heart trembles
At your thought"</i>

1209
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,875
<i>"Time brings us together"</i>

1210
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,417
<i>"We don't have to miss
Each other anymore"</i>

1211
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:38,208
<i>"This date goes on individually"</i>

1212
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:40,875
<i>"We can't get together, can we?"</i>

1213
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:46,125
<i>"We share the food
But the bill is separate"</i>

1214
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:50,750
<i>"You're all I need in my life"</i>

1215
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:56,041
<i>"As I gently kiss you
On the cheek"</i>

1216
01:02:56,625 --> 01:03:01,542
<i>"My silence has
A million questions"</i>

1217
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:06,750
<i>"You're right here
But I can't see you"</i>

1218
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,083
This place looks strange.

1219
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,000
I come here
whether I'm happy or sad.

1220
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,667
This is my most favourite place.

1221
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:40,917
Surya, do you see the idols
of Rama and Sita in the future?

1222
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,041
‐Yes.
‐Thank god!

1223
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:47,083
‐Why?
‐If I had any wishes as a kid,

1224
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,041
I'd write them on a note
and put it there.

1225
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:51,583
And, surprisingly, each one
of those would come true.

1226
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,041
Do something.

1227
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:54,875
What?

1228
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:55,917
Try homeopathy.

1229
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,792
You'll recover faster.

1230
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,000
<i>"I don't get what you'd call this"</i>

1231
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,542
<i>"Nobody could put it into words"</i>

1232
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:08,667
<i>"Those winds that touch you
Emit a beautiful fragrance"</i>

1233
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,417
<i>"Let's turn back the clock"</i>

1234
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:14,083
<i>"Get closer like we wish"</i>

1235
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:17,000
<i>"I will make the distance disappear"</i>

1236
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,583
<i>"Come running into my arms"</i>

1237
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:23,750
<i>"This is exciting"</i>

1238
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,375
<i>"I've never felt like this before"</i>

1239
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:34,208
<i>"I love to be around you"</i>

1240
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:41,125
<i>"I wonder
When our dream's coming true"</i>

1241
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:43,708
Did not find him.

1242
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,125
I'll be back.

1243
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:46,834
What's your problem?

1244
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:49,166
Video call isn't getting
connected to Surya.

1245
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:51,125
I sent him the mails,
friend requests.

1246
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,625
I searched the entire social media.

1247
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,083
Everything shows only loading.
I can't find him anywhere.

1248
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:57,000
He might have given a fake ID.
Who knows?

1249
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:58,041
Shut up!

1250
01:04:58,458 --> 01:04:59,625
As it is, blue cup.

1251
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:02,166
‐Are you also holding a blue cup.
‐Dude, why are you sitting here?

1252
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:03,084
Hey!

1253
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,750
‐What's wrong?
‐Vennela is sitting there.

1254
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,208
Vennela is here?

1255
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:09,750
She's sitting in that chair
in 2014.

1256
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,500
We are having coffee together.

1257
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:13,125
Sounds exciting, huh?

1258
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:14,417
Very exciting.

1259
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:15,542
Sorry, madam.

1260
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,834
Hey!

1261
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:18,877
Sorry.

1262
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,583
Hey! Are you a Pisces?
I'm a Gemini.

1263
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,375
That is 2013. Not your business.
You carry on.

1264
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,250
What else?

1265
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,542
Hello, Surya.
I should tell you something.

1266
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:37,626
Go ahead.

1267
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,583
I don't know if this is right.

1268
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,125
I'm not even sure when we'll meet.

1269
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:44,750
I thought I'd tell you
when we meet.

1270
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:47,458
But I can't hold it in anymore.

1271
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,417
This is a first to me.

1272
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,959
I didn't know how to tell you.

1273
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,792
So I wrote it on the bench.

1274
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:56,750
Look to your left.

1275
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:07,875
Hello. Did you look?

1276
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:10,209
Yes.

1277
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,500
Why are you quiet?

1278
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:13,625
Are you blushing?

1279
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:15,875
Vennela...

1280
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:17,875
I should tell you something.

1281
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:19,750
Don't tell me you're married.

1282
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,291
Hey! Listen to me.

1283
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,250
I don't have any feelings for you.

1284
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,417
I'm sorry.

1285
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,834
<i>I know how it feels to be rejected.</i>

1286
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,250
I fell in love with a girl
5 years ago.

1287
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,375
<i>I don't know why,</i>

1288
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,417
<i>but she didn't like me.</i>

1289
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:44,041
<i>Now you're saying you love me,</i>

1290
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,291
<i>and I don't know how to react.</i>

1291
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:51,208
<i>Maybe...</i>

1292
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:54,208
I'm still in love with that girl.

1293
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,208
<i>You're there, and I'm here.</i>

1294
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:59,500
<i>I thought all this amusing,</i>

1295
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:01,375
<i>but I didn't expect you
to develop feelings for me.</i>

1296
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:02,667
Why didn't you tell me before?

1297
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:05,333
I hate you, Surya.

1298
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,125
<i>I hate you so much!</i>

1299
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:09,417
I really hate you!

1300
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:24,625
I love you.

1301
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:30,834
Who the hell are you?

1302
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:33,625
I'm crying over a guy,
and you're proposing to me.

1303
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:34,752
Go away!

1304
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,750
Good evening. Welcome to
the evening news bulletin.

1305
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:13,118
A middle‐class father
couldn't buy popcorn for his kid

1306
01:08:13,152 --> 01:08:14,875
and committed suicide.

1307
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:16,251
What the hell!

1308
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,161
A boy was stoned to death

1309
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,707
for rejecting a girl's love
by other women.

1310
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:21,501
What? How could they pelt him
with stones?

1311
01:08:21,542 --> 01:08:22,750
Shit! Run ads. Hurry.

1312
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:25,126
What the hell is this?

1313
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:27,166
I should ask you that. Why are you
reacting during a live?

1314
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:28,166
I mean stones...

1315
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:30,875
We can discuss it later.
First, finish the live.

1316
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,500
Men have no safety anymore.

1317
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,875
You can get it at a pharmacy.

1318
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,000
Come on, don't be a kid.
All right, hurry.

1319
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:38,707
How long should I wait for you?

1320
01:08:38,707 --> 01:08:40,707
Can't you see that
I'm working here? Get lost!

1321
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,250
Such an ass!

1322
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,041
‐You pest!
‐Hello!

1323
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:45,959
People like her should be
pelted with stones.

1324
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,625
You need to love the girl
to accept her proposal, right?

1325
01:08:50,707 --> 01:08:52,291
You can't just kill the guy.

1326
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:57,166
Hey, the day a guy
rejects a girl's love bravely

1327
01:08:57,542 --> 01:09:01,959
is the day a guy achieves freedom
according to Ram Gopal Varma.

1328
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,959
Damn it, man!
A man has to go through so much.

1329
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,250
You're average‐looking.
It's not so hard.

1330
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:08,875
What about a guy like me?

1331
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,166
‐What?
‐I mean...

1332
01:09:10,582 --> 01:09:14,457
a survey says that girls like guys
like me to look more beautiful.

1333
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:16,625
If so, Vennela confessed
to me recently.

1334
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:18,250
And I rejected!

1335
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,250
‐She confessed?
‐Yeah.

1336
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,417
Exactly how did she do that?

1337
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:21,834
Did she send a love letter
through a time machine?

1338
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:22,875
Stop it, man.

1339
01:09:23,582 --> 01:09:25,207
She wrote it on the bench
and confessed.

1340
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,125
‐Where did she write?
‐On the bench.

1341
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,625
Do you know why I listen to you
though you're full of crap?

1342
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,962
Because you lend me
money whenever I ask.

1343
01:09:30,997 --> 01:09:32,166
But you're talking
about a break‐up.

1344
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:33,625
‐Go to hell!
‐Hey!

1345
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:36,582
It wouldn't be a break‐up
if I don't love her.

1346
01:09:36,707 --> 01:09:37,875
What are you saying?

1347
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,375
Is she heartbroken?

1348
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:41,542
I guess.

1349
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:43,082
Will she commit suicide?

1350
01:09:43,707 --> 01:09:44,707
Maybe.

1351
01:09:44,959 --> 01:09:46,000
What? Suicide!

1352
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,667
Like that news article
you just read,

1353
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,959
she might commit suicide.

1354
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,166
Do you really think so?

1355
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:54,041
Hey, please don't add a suicide
and a ghost in your story.

1356
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,125
Nonsense!

1357
01:09:58,208 --> 01:09:59,126
Idiot.

1358
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:03,460
Oi!

1359
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,500
Where did you disappear?

1360
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:06,460
Ta‐da!

1361
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:08,542
Hey! What's that?

1362
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:09,875
I'll tell you. Wait, wait.

1363
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:13,291
<i>‐Has she lost her mind?</i>
‐Correct.

1364
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Here, have this.

1365
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:16,458
‐What is this?
‐Cheers.

1366
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:21,208
This is really alcohol!

1367
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:23,208
From where did you get it?

1368
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,375
It's your dad's.

1369
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,417
‐Hey!
‐What's wrong?

1370
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,292
You can't put the glass down
after saying cheers.

1371
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:33,458
It's a grave sin.

1372
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:34,583
Do a bottoms‐up.

1373
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:35,543
Hello.

1374
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,041
‐No. It's wrong.
‐You have a cold, right?

1375
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,375
This will help.

1376
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:40,793
See?

1377
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,918
You're sneezing.

1378
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,250
‐This will help with the cold?
‐Yes. Just drink it.

1379
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:52,125
Hold on. Open. Open.

1380
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,125
Why is it like that?

1381
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,625
That's it.

1382
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,333
Of course, you had a heart attack.

1383
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:59,250
I just want to get high.

1384
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:07,583
Who's disturbing you at this hour?

1385
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:09,875
Who else?

1386
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:11,417
It's Surya.

1387
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,208
What's his problem?

1388
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:14,625
What's his problem?

1389
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:15,959
He rejected you, right?

1390
01:11:17,667 --> 01:11:19,625
All men are cheats.

1391
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,708
He's calling again, grandma.

1392
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:22,708
Ask him what's up.

1393
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:23,708
He's so dead!

1394
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:25,417
Take it.

1395
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,041
Have this and blast him.

1396
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:28,917
Have it and bash him.

1397
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:30,708
Hello, Vennela.

1398
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,583
Thank god, you answered.

1399
01:11:34,834 --> 01:11:36,500
What happened to you?
What are you doing?

1400
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,750
Fixing a drink.

1401
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:39,792
Hey! Don't do anything stupid.

1402
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,208
So what if I rejected you?

1403
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,667
Go, find an adult
and put them on the line.

1404
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:45,667
Hey, fruit.

1405
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,917
It's not what you think.

1406
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,875
What? Are you drinking?

1407
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:50,500
You ask me to quit
and then do this?

1408
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,291
‐This is cheating.
‐Look who's talking.

1409
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,708
You thought I'd die
if you rejected me?

1410
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:58,125
I have a goal.
Bloody fool.

1411
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,458
I think you're still pissed
with me.

1412
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,292
<i>You're punishing me for something
that happened in your past?</i>

1413
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,291
How do I even believe
what you said?

1414
01:12:05,959 --> 01:12:07,417
Tell me your story right now.

1415
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:08,625
Let's not talk about that.

1416
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,500
Do you have something
urgent to attend to?

1417
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:13,500
My maid's on leave since 4 days.

1418
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,041
Thought I'd wash my clothes.

1419
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:17,625
Hey! Is she more important to you?
Answer me!

1420
01:12:20,834 --> 01:12:22,583
Though I seem
like a boring guy now.

1421
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:24,834

and you made me‐‐

1437
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:44,542
I know, dude.
That's what I told them too.

1438
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:47,375
They agreed to pay Rs. 1,500
if you sang.

1439
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:49,542
We need the money
for the music competition.

‐Where is it?

‐Have you seen a coconut anywhere?
‐Get lost!

1442
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:56,668
Why are you yelling?
Where is it?

1443
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,250
On top of that,
you're teasing girls.

1444
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,458
They're teasing me.
Didn't you notice that?

1445
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:01,583
‐Oh, yeah?
‐Yes.

1446
01:14:01,834 --> 01:14:04,625
If you take up such gigs again,
I'll break a coconut on your head.

1447

No, dude, listen to me.

Hey, we got the money.

1450
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:28,917
Go away, man.

1451
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,208
If you could give me her details‐‐

1452
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,917
You visit a temple
to wash away your sins.

1453
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,041
Not to make new ones.

1454
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:50,667
I can't believe you're asking me
for a girl's details.

1455
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:53,750
You're dangerous!

1456
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,291
Why? What's wrong?

1457
01:15:55,792 --> 01:16:00,291
People ask God directly
for a job, wife and kids.

1458
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:02,125
Why shouldn't we ask
for her address?

1459
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,000
‐Please tell us, priest.
‐Yes!

1460
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:05,792
I see your logic.

1461
01:16:05,959 --> 01:16:08,000
But she's sensitive,
and you're outgoing.

1462
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,291
Do one thing!

1463
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,792
Why don't you work in the temple
for a few weeks?

1464
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,458
If I like your behaviour,
I'll give you her address.

‐What say?
‐What do I get started on first?

1466

01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:41,166
‐It is, after yours.
‐Oh.

1556
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,667
Hey! This is my favourite guitar.

1557
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:45,459
Oh.

1558
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,208
I bought it 2 months back.

1559
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,041
‐How much is it?
‐Rs. 25,000 only.

1560
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,375
Nice.

1561
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:57,543
Let's go.

1562
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:01,583
He's next. I'll go check
on him. You stay here.

1563
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,542
Uncle, you're Surya's father,
aren't you?

1564
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:11,417
‐Yes.
‐He's an amazing talent.

1565
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:13,250
He'll definitely win
this competition.

1566
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:14,585
Thank you.

1567
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:27,083
Man, you don't get
on the stage, please.

1568
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:27,667
Whatever.

1569
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:28,875
What's up, guys!
All set?

1570
01:24:28,917 --> 01:24:30,125
‐Yeah, yeah.
‐All set!

1571
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,583
All the best, Surya.
You're next.

1572
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:32,750
Thanks for the opportunity.

1573
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:33,792
We're next?

1574
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:36,125
‐Sir, someone's calling you.
‐Who's calling?

1575
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,917
We're next! Guys, get ready!

1576
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,584
Yeah!

1577
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:40,250
‐Ready, boys?
‐Let's go.

1578
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:41,251
Sure.

1579
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:42,375
Dude, did you find her yet?

1580
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:43,126
Go away!

1581
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:47,626
‐Didn't you go to the temple today?
‐Hold your tongue!

1582
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:49,959
Surya, he's provoking you.
Calm down.

1583
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:51,708
I thought you'd be dressed in blue.

1584
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:54,875
‐What do you want?
‐Drop from the show.

1585
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:56,125
Music or her?

1586
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:58,291
I know where she is at this moment.

1587
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:00,083
Tell me where she is.

1588
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:01,542
Please.

1589
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:04,625
‐So, you're out?
‐Surya, he's bluffing.

1590
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:05,792
Please tell me, dude.

1591
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:08,959
Clock tower.
If you go now, she might be there.

1592
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:12,166
Sorry, guys.

1593
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:13,417
‐Hold on. I'm coming.
‐What!

1594
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,166
Hey!

1595
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:15,708
That was a great performance!

1596
01:25:15,834 --> 01:25:18,708
The next band to perform
is Surya and his gang.

1597
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:21,625
Surya and gang.

1598
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:23,625
Surya!

1599
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:26,166
Surya ran away!

1600
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:29,291
Final call for Surya and gang.

1601
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,500
Okay, let's move on.

1602
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:42,001
Hey!

1603
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,750
What will you tell her?

1604
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:47,917
I don't know.

1605
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,041
I hate you, Surya!

1606
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,250
I really hate you!

1607
01:26:14,917 --> 01:26:15,917
I love you.

1608
01:26:19,959 --> 01:26:22,625
I'm crying over a guy,
and you're confessing to me?

1609
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:24,293
I hate this!

1610
01:27:27,834 --> 01:27:28,834
Come on.

1611
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:30,417
Surya.

1612
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,333
All right. You head home.

1613
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,166
I failed at everything
I believed in.

1614
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
My music.

1615
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:04,041
Love.

1616
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:06,542
Everything.

1617
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:12,000
Since when do you know her?

1618
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:18,333
You'll look back at this in a year
and laugh at it.

1619
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,000
That's what life's all about.

1620
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:22,458
How long has it been since
mom passed away, dad?

1621
01:28:24,959 --> 01:28:25,959
Did you forget her?

1622
01:28:27,417 --> 01:28:28,417
Can you?

1623
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:31,834
This girl's still alive, dad.

1624
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:35,125
Okay. Leave it.

1625
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:36,291
I can understand.

1626
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,250
Stop it, dad!

1627
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:40,291
You're not my friend.

1628
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Act like my father.

1629
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:47,834
I crossed your age 25 years back.

1630
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:50,000
I can understand your anger.

1631
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:52,375
If I had a bad day at work,

1632
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:54,708
I'd come home and yell at your mom.

1633
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:56,542
This is what happens
in every house.

1634
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,500
A family tolerates you.

1635
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,291
Anybody else would fight with you.

1636
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,166
Dad, this is what I hate.

1637
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:06,250
You're being too sweet
and too cool.

1638
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:10,125
You gave me money for fuel
because I was going to meet a girl.

1639
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,792
Now I came home in tears,
and you're comforting me.

1640
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,750
So, if I keep making mistakes,

1641
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,125
you'll forgive me,
leaving me in guilt!

1642
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:19,459
Hey!

1643
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,542
Son, we only have each other.

1644
01:29:22,542 --> 01:29:23,168
All right.

1645
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:26,291
There's no music or that girl
in my life anymore.

1646
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:27,667
Tell me what I should do.

1647
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:29,333
That's what you want, right?

1648
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:32,917
I met Chandu uncle and asked
for a job for you on his TV channel.

1649
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:34,042
He agreed.

1650
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:37,750
If you keep yourself busy,
it'll make it easier to forget her.

1651
01:29:37,917 --> 01:29:44,375
You want me to lead
a robotic life from 9 to 6?

1652
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:47,000
‐I can't do that, dad.
‐Come on, son.

1653
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,875
TV is also a creative field.

1654
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:52,583
Dad, I'm good at music
and I love making music.

1655
01:29:52,959 --> 01:29:54,041
I can't do anything else.

1656
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:56,834
I can't do what you like
or live like you do.

1657
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,667
I'd lose myself.

1658
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:01,083
I'd rather die early.

1659
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:04,041
Are you saying my life is a waste?

1660
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:07,208
Your routine life is what got me
vexed with life.

1661
01:30:07,959 --> 01:30:10,125
I found my excitement in music.

1662
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:11,959
You wouldn't get it.

1663
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:13,376
Hey!

1664
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:15,000
Hey...

1665
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:16,792
Surya! Surya!

1666
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:18,333
Don't say another word, dad.

1667
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:19,834
I'll do as you say.

1668
01:30:20,542 --> 01:30:21,959
I'll also become a version of you.

1669
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,500
Leave me alone for some time, dad.

1670
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:25,875
I might say something hurtful.

1671
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,750
All right.

1672
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:35,417
I'll get some air and come back.

1673
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,333
<i>He said he'd come back.</i>

1674
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,041
<i>But he didn't.</i>

1675
01:31:10,917 --> 01:31:12,000
Where did this happen?

1676
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,208
A Gachibowli warehouse.

1677
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:18,792
While he was trying
to save somebody.

1678
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:20,583
I'm very sorry, Surya.

1679
01:31:21,834 --> 01:31:22,917
I'm responsible for it.

1680
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,834
Hey! Don't say that.

1681
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:26,291
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

1682
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:28,875
<i>It's only destiny, Surya.</i>

1683
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:31,166
When you confessed...

1684
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:32,917
Forget that.

1685
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:36,041
I also rejected a few guys.

1686
01:31:36,417 --> 01:31:37,251
But...

1687
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:40,458
<i>none of them loved me
as much as you loved her.</i>

1688
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:43,083
To be honest,
I don't know what to say.

1689
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:46,041
But I know one thing for sure.

1690
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:48,250
You're lucky to have had
such a father.

1691
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:52,333
And she's unlucky
to have let you go.

1692
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:55,417
Nothing more about me.

1693
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:57,834
If that incident hadn't happened...

1694
01:31:58,291 --> 01:31:59,917
Don't think more about it, Surya.

1695
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,417
<i>There is nothing you could do
with what had happened.</i>

1696
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:04,959
<i>Don't punish yourself,
please. Okay?</i>

1697
01:32:04,959 --> 01:32:05,793
Thank you.

1698
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:10,959
Good night, Surya.

1699
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:13,125
Bye.

1700
01:32:19,959 --> 01:32:23,000
Priest! Check for an auspicious day
in the coming three months.

1701
01:32:23,917 --> 01:32:24,917
Why is he back?

1702
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:26,458
What's going on, dad?

1703
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:28,166
‐That...
‐Hi, Venny.

1704
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:32,291
Adults are discussing
about your wedding.

1705
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:33,293
You go inside.

1706
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:35,291
What's the matter with you, man?

1707
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:36,583
What's the matter with you?

1708
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,166
I gave you a chance
to pass that exam.

1709
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:39,667
But you failed.
Now marry him.

1710
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:43,041
Uncle, don't give her the credit.

1711
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:44,084
I made her fail.

1712
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:45,708
Yeah, I did.

1713
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:49,500
I broke 101 coconuts at the temple,
praying for her to fail.

1714
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:50,501
How dare he!

1715
01:32:50,542 --> 01:32:51,625
It's all my grace.

1716
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:54,458
How dare you pray for me to fail!

1717
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,333
‐Stop...
‐Let me go, grandma.

1718
01:32:56,458 --> 01:32:57,708
‐Calm down, dear. No.
‐Stop!

1719
01:32:57,959 --> 01:32:59,208
‐Cool down!
‐Look at him!

1720
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:02,083
Stop. You shouldn't sacrifice
a human to the Goddess.

1721
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,125
Shut up!

1722
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:06,291
If prayers and chants made you pass,
what's the point in studying?

1723
01:33:06,291 --> 01:33:07,917
Stop acting up
and agree to the marriage.

1724
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:09,834
Dad, come with me.
We need to talk.

1725
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:10,751
Come!

1726
01:33:13,542 --> 01:33:14,168
What is it?

1727
01:33:14,209 --> 01:33:16,751
How can you get me married
to someone who wants me to fail?

1728
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:18,251
Dad.

1729
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:21,708
I know that it's your responsibility
to get me married.

1730
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:25,166
But once I'm married,
my new life begins.

1731
01:33:25,834 --> 01:33:27,458
I never said I don't want marriage.

1732
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:29,500
I just don't want
to get married now.

1733
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:31,875
And I can't marry that guy at all.

1734
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:34,625
He's not looking for a wife.

1735
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:37,834
He just needs someone
to clean and cook.

1736
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:40,708
I want someone
who understands my dreams.

1737
01:33:40,834 --> 01:33:42,333
Are these your dreams? Huh?

1738
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:43,334
Dad!

1739
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:53,375
‐He's back.
‐Priest, fix the date.

1740
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:54,583
‐Okay, sir.
‐Dad!

1741
01:33:54,917 --> 01:33:55,917
Why are you yelling?

1742
01:33:55,917 --> 01:33:58,542
I'll crack the GET exam
no matter what this time.

1743
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,875
You've failed twice already.
How many chances do you need?

1744
01:34:00,917 --> 01:34:02,417
I didn't fail because of me.

1745
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:04,792
It's because of this idiot.

1746
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:06,750
Naughty girl!

1747
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,834
I won't just crack it.
I'll top the exam this time.

1748
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,918
Topper?

1749
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,918
No way!

1750
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:19,708
Dad, if I don't clear it this time,
I'll marry any loser you get me.

1751
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:22,208
If you fail, I'll get you married
to this loser only.

1752
01:34:24,166 --> 01:34:25,084
Sorry, son.

1753
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,166
It's okay, uncle.

1754
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:28,500
I get that you see me as family.

1755
01:34:29,959 --> 01:34:30,877
Okay, Venny.

1756
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:32,583
I'll go break coconuts for you.

1757
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,792
Why don't you break one
on your head? Good riddance!

1758
01:34:34,834 --> 01:34:38,583
I'll kill you with witchcraft
if you pray for me again. Idiot!

1759
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,375
‐Come inside.
‐Let go, mom.

1760
01:34:40,417 --> 01:34:42,041
He's so useless.
I want to see his end.

1761
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:45,834
Ask her to meditate, uncle.

1762
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,667
You challenged that you'll pass
like some wrestler.

1763
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,208
How will you pass, eh?

1764
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:53,750
I don't know, grandma.

1765
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:55,959
But there's no way
I'm marrying him.

1766
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
You won't pass even
if the question paper is leaked.

1767
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:03,375
What did you just say?

1768
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:05,417
You won't pass even
if the question paper is leaked.

1769
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:07,333
Paper leak.

1770
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
What is it?

1771
01:35:15,959 --> 01:35:17,166
What happened to her?

1772
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:20,000
Wow! You gave
such an amazing idea, granny.

1773
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:22,625
Watch me pass the exam.

1774
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,458
Why?
Have you never done it?

1775
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:36,667
Don't talk like a nerd.

1776
01:35:36,917 --> 01:35:39,166
I did. But according to
the court of law, it's a crime.

1777
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,500
I'll get arrested, you know.

1778
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:42,458
When will you get arrested?
In 2014 or 2019?

1779
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:44,834
Just shut up and do it.

1780
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,291
Ask for anything else, Vennela.
Please!

1781
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:48,542
Accept my love then.

1782
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:49,834
Where will I find the papers?

1783
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:53,792
Sorry.

1784
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:55,542
Why are we here, dude?

1785
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,708
Look for it.

1786
01:35:57,667 --> 01:35:59,083
You can tell me at least.

1787
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,792
About psychology
in Swathi's book...

1788
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,291
Is he looking at us?

1789
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:09,583
We look like thieves
in this mask and glares.

1790
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:10,917
Go ask him what you want.

1791
01:36:10,917 --> 01:36:12,041
You go.

1792
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,417
No. You go ask.

1793
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:16,000
Go!

1794
01:36:17,834 --> 01:36:19,291
I'm taking these maths
and physics books, bro.

1795
01:36:19,291 --> 01:36:20,959
Why're you scared?
It's just a book shop.

1796
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:22,417
‐Wait, man!
‐Here.

1797
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,750
Here. Take it.

1798
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:26,417
What's there upstairs?

1799
01:36:26,542 --> 01:36:28,417
Hello! You don't get condoms here.

1800
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:30,417
We have plenty of those.

1801
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,500
Ask him.

1802
01:36:32,834 --> 01:36:33,752
That...

1803
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,792
Do you have GET question papers?

1804
01:36:35,959 --> 01:36:36,959
Which year?

1805
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,041
2014.

1806
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,166
Why do you need those?

1807
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:42,917
Why are you so nervous?

1808
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:46,251
I have them from 2014 to 2018.
Here, take it!

1809
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:47,792
Why do you need
the question papers?

1810
01:36:47,834 --> 01:36:49,041
Vennela needs help.

1811
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:50,125
That's why.

1812
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:52,667
2014. Vennela.

1813
01:36:52,917 --> 01:36:58,417
Now she is going to top the exam
and credit you for her success?

1814
01:36:58,667 --> 01:37:00,708
I don't mind going to jail
helping her.

1815
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:01,875
Go to jail even?

1816
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:05,000
Sir, do you have a book called
<i>How To Cure A Crazy Person</i>?

1817
01:37:05,041 --> 01:37:07,208
I have <i>You're Responsible
For Your Own Karma.</i>

1818
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:09,500
You could just look at my face
to know that.

1819
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:10,376
‐Yes!
‐Idiot!

1820
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,250
‐Note it down.
‐Hold on. I'm writing <i>Om</i>.

1821
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:16,583
You're cheating and
making God a part of it?

1822
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,083
Just tell me the answers.

1823
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,500
Sir, I am back.

1824
01:38:04,834 --> 01:38:06,458
Oh, you're back.

1825
01:38:06,583 --> 01:38:08,667
You show up every year
like it's your maternal home.

1826
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:11,917
Sir, what's the process this time?

1827
01:38:12,333 --> 01:38:14,792
Do you ask questions
based on my answers?

1828
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:17,625
Or do I answer based
on your questions?

1829
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,584
Don't come up with new processes.
Follow what's there.

1830
01:38:20,667 --> 01:38:22,542
This time, I have something
you'd never imagine.

1831
01:38:22,542 --> 01:38:25,291
I also got something for you.
Did you know that?

1832
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:28,750
What's that?
Question paper! Set 3!

1833
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:31,959
Sir, starting with C. Mirchi.

1834
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:34,166
Mirchi? Excuse me!

1835
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,875
‐Sir?
‐Question paper.

1836
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,959
Actually, I don't need it.

1837
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,125
But, I'll take it for you.

1838
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:41,250
I'll check the questions
and answer.

1839
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,333
Silence!

1840
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:16,458
‐Sir
‐What?

1841
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,000
I have a small doubt.

1842
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:22,041
It will be cold in Germany.

1843
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:25,166
Will sweaters from Koti market
keep me warm?

1844
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,750
You didn't even pass the exam, and
you're dreaming about Germany.

1845
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,250
‐Sit down!
‐Future planning, sir.

1846
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,375
Stupid questions!

1847
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:52,291
Sir.

1848
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:56,375
I shook the class, eh?

1849
01:39:56,875 --> 01:39:57,875
Bye, sir.

1850
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,250
Is Vennela home?

1851
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:07,625
Dear!

1852
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:09,166
What?

1853
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:10,667
Somebody's here.

1854
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,500
I guess you got the wrong address.

1855
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,125
Vennela is your daughter, isn't it?

1856
01:40:16,834 --> 01:40:18,250
Don't look at me. Say yes.

1857
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:19,917
Yes! She's our daughter.

1858
01:40:20,834 --> 01:40:21,834
What did she do?

1859
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:22,875
Call her.

1860
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:24,209
Go.

1861
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:25,168
Vennela!

1862
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:30,500
What happened, dad?

1863
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:33,125
What did you do?

1864
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:35,250
I didn't do anything.

1865
01:40:35,375 --> 01:40:36,293
What's wrong?

1866
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:37,333
Congratulations, sir.

1867
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:38,708
‐What for?
‐Come on, sir.

1868
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:43,917
1.3 lakh students appeared for GET
and only 21% passed.

1869
01:40:44,166 --> 01:40:45,959
Your daughter's one of them.
Check this out.

1870
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,875
Congrats, Vennela.
You got 87th rank in GET.

1871
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:52,875
Really?

1872
01:40:58,083 --> 01:41:00,208
Did you pass for real?

1873
01:41:00,792 --> 01:41:02,291
Are you dumb? Shut up!

1874
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:05,708
Thank you. Thank you.

1875
01:41:05,959 --> 01:41:06,877
One second.

1876
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,792
‐Okay?
‐Super, bro!

1877
01:41:10,792 --> 01:41:11,875
Record now.

1878
01:41:12,458 --> 01:41:14,291
How do you feel as a father, sir?

1879
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:17,792
Whose choice was automobile
engineering? You or your father?

1880
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:20,458
Who's your inspiration?

1881
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,500
My dad.

1882
01:41:30,291 --> 01:41:31,792
I passed, Surya!

1883
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:35,917
And you know, my marriage is off.

1884
01:41:35,959 --> 01:41:37,208
Wow! Congrats!

1885
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,375
I got 87th rank in India.

1886
01:41:39,417 --> 01:41:41,083
I thought you'd get 1st.

1887
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:44,708
I wrote a few wrong answers
to avoid suspicion.

1888
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:46,417
I'm leaving for Germany
in 2 weeks, Surya.

1889
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:48,375
You made this possible.
Tell me what you want.

1890
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:51,500
No, thanks.
I'd have to buy it for myself.

1891
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:52,792
Forget it.

1892
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:54,542
One minute!

1893
01:41:54,583 --> 01:41:56,583
Bro, Vennela got 87th rank.

1894
01:41:57,166 --> 01:42:00,083
Congrats. What's next?
Will she go overseas for graduation?

1895
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:02,542
‐How do you know?
‐Try something new next time.

1896
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:03,625
‐Hey!
‐Idiot!

1897
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:05,917
Surya...

1898
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:11,417
I'm not able to enjoy this success.

1899
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,708
‐Why?
‐Because I didn't work hard for it.

1900
01:42:15,417 --> 01:42:16,792
Like I've done something wrong.

1901
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I feel guilty.

1902
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:20,208
It's okay. Feeling guilty is good.

1903
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:22,375
We need to be honest
with ourselves.

1904
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:25,041
I never felt like this
though I've failed so many times.

1905
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:27,208
Thought I'd give the exam again.

1906
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:31,041
But now that I passed,
I feel like I've cheated everybody.

1907
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:33,708
Tell your dad the truth
if you feel so guilty.

1908
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:38,875
Surya! Remember I said
let's give life a chance.

1909
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,458
You'll also get that chance soon.

1910
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:43,834
And I'm sure
your dreams will also be fulfilled.

1911
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,792
Vennela! Where are you?

1912
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:47,542
‐What?
‐Come here.

1913
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:49,667
‐Mom's calling. I'll call you back.
<i>‐Okay.</i>

1914
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:55,708
[singing randomly]

1915
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:13,333
Pray to the flame.

1916
01:43:13,542 --> 01:43:15,000
[chanting]

1917
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:43,125
‐Hello.
<i>‐Tell me.</i>

1918
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:44,708
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

1919
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:46,333
I was in a ritual.

1920
01:43:46,875 --> 01:43:48,959
‐Today's is dad's death anniversary.
‐Oh, I'm sorry.

1921
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:50,250
You wanted to say something?

1922
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:52,834
My admission got confirmed
in a German university, Surya.

1923
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:53,875
Congrats, Vennela.

1924
01:43:53,959 --> 01:43:55,500
I told dad what happened.

1925
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:57,291
I apologised as well.

1926
01:43:57,458 --> 01:43:58,458
What did he say?

1927
01:43:58,542 --> 01:43:59,792
He yelled at me a little.

1928
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:02,333
Asked me to focus from now on.

1929
01:44:03,458 --> 01:44:07,542
I feel so relieved after
apologising to dad wholeheartedly.

1930
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:10,041
I couldn't apologise to my dad.

1931
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:14,333
Even if I want to apologise now,
it's not possible.

1932
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:17,542
He's never coming back.

1933
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:18,959
Today's the day, huh?

1934
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,208
What time did he die, Surya?

1935
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:31,917
8:30 in the night.

1936
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:33,458
8:30 p.m.

1937
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:35,291
In the next 2 hours.

1938
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:39,208
Vennela, what did you just say?

1939
01:44:39,792 --> 01:44:40,875
In 2 hours.

1940
01:44:40,959 --> 01:44:41,959
Which means...

1941
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:43,375
Dad passed away today.

1942
01:44:43,917 --> 01:44:45,542
You're talking to me
on the same day.

1943
01:44:45,917 --> 01:44:46,917
<i>5 years back.</i>

1944
01:44:47,875 --> 01:44:49,166
Which means you can see dad.

1945
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:51,166
You can talk to dad.

1946
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,500
You can...

1947
01:44:54,083 --> 01:44:55,083
Save your dad.

1948
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,250
But, Surya, what do we do now?

1949
01:44:59,792 --> 01:45:01,959
‐I...
‐No, Vennela, listen to me.

1950
01:45:02,291 --> 01:45:04,667
You can save him if you rush
to the Gachibowli warehouse.

1951
01:45:06,041 --> 01:45:06,875
<i>Please, Vennela.</i>

1952
01:45:07,375 --> 01:45:09,500
I guess this is another chance
God gave me.

1953
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,917
Please, Vennela. Will you go?

1954
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:13,542
I'll go.

1955
01:45:13,917 --> 01:45:15,583
You lost your life this day.

1956
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:19,250
If I can save your dad,
you'll have your life back.

1957
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,583
I'll save your dad, Surya.

1958
01:45:27,917 --> 01:45:28,917
‐Hello?
‐Hello, Vennela!

1959
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,542
‐Have you reached?
‐I just reached.

1960
01:45:30,542 --> 01:45:32,667
‐Is dad there?
‐There is no one here, Surya.

1961
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,375
I'm looking around.

1962
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:37,875
Search properly, Vennela.
He will be right there.

1963
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:39,333
There's no one here, Surya.

1964
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,250
Surya.

1965
01:45:44,917 --> 01:45:46,959
‐What was his shirt's colour?
‐Grey!

1966
01:45:47,083 --> 01:45:48,208
Grey‐coloured shirt!

1967
01:45:51,542 --> 01:45:53,834
Surya, I found your dad.

1968
01:45:58,959 --> 01:45:59,959
Vennela!

1969
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:02,208
Hello. Vennela!

1970
01:46:02,792 --> 01:46:03,792
Pull her back.

1971
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,542
Hey!

1972
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:10,917
Who's there?

1973
01:46:19,417 --> 01:46:21,250
Hello, Vennela! Shit!

1974
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:22,458
Bring her in. Quick.

1975
01:46:25,959 --> 01:46:26,959
Hello.

1976
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:28,501
Vennela!

1977
01:46:28,542 --> 01:46:30,750
Vennela! Can you hear me?

1978
01:46:31,542 --> 01:46:32,750
Hello...

1979
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:33,834
<i>Hello.</i>

1980
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:52,126
Hey!

1981
01:46:52,542 --> 01:46:57,375
<i>It means
Surya's dad died saving me.</i>

1982
01:46:57,792 --> 01:46:59,125
Let her go! Hey!

1983
01:46:59,667 --> 01:47:00,667
Dad?

1984
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:03,750
Dad, it's me, Surya!

1985
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:05,667
<i>Dad... Hello...</i>

1986
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:17,875
Move...

1987
01:47:23,667 --> 01:47:24,875
Hello, Vennela...

1988
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:26,375
Hello, Vennela...

1989
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:50,750
Uncle!

1990
01:48:02,667 --> 01:48:05,208
Dear! You go from here!

1991
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:13,375
‐Oh, my!
‐Uncle...

1992
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:15,458
<i>Dear, are you okay?</i>

1993
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:22,959
You're fine, right?

1994
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,041
I'm all right.

1995
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:28,750
<i>Uncle!</i>

1996
01:48:35,667 --> 01:48:36,708
<i>‐Speak to me, dad.</i>
‐Help!

1997
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,708
<i>Dad, what happened?</i>

1998
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:46,333
Uncle, look at me.

1999
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:47,583
Uncle!

2000
01:48:48,125 --> 01:48:49,125
Help!

2001
01:48:49,834 --> 01:48:50,834
‐Help, please.
‐Dear!

2002
01:48:51,875 --> 01:48:53,083
Dear...

2003
01:48:54,291 --> 01:48:55,417
Do me a favour.

2004
01:48:55,708 --> 01:48:56,708
Tell me, uncle.

2005
01:48:56,834 --> 01:48:58,417
My son, Surya...

2006
01:48:58,458 --> 01:48:59,750
I know him, uncle.

2007
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:01,125
I know Surya.

2008
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:02,126
Dear...

2009
01:49:41,291 --> 01:49:42,209
Surya.

2010
01:49:44,083 --> 01:49:44,708
Phone?

2011
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:11,000
Sorry, Surya!

2012
01:50:12,458 --> 01:50:13,500
Sorry...

2013
01:51:30,542 --> 01:51:37,166
<i>The Surya who loved me and
the Surya whom I loved are the same?</i>

2014
01:51:51,708 --> 01:51:54,000
Make sure his last wish
is fulfilled.

2015
01:52:13,959 --> 01:52:15,625
Excuse me! Please.

2016
01:52:22,792 --> 01:52:24,750
Hold him. Let's go!

2017
01:52:25,917 --> 01:52:27,208
Careful. Slowly.

2018
01:52:27,917 --> 01:52:28,917
Hold him.

2019
01:52:29,583 --> 01:52:30,583
Open the door.

2020
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:31,708
Careful.

2021
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:39,750
Surya!

2022
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:55,208
Hello, dad.

2023
01:52:55,333 --> 01:52:56,167
Hello.

2024
01:52:56,458 --> 01:52:58,000
<i>Mom's phone is with me. What is it?</i>

2025
01:52:58,083 --> 01:52:59,583
<i>I know. I called for you only.</i>

2026
01:52:59,667 --> 01:53:01,376
<i>The police are here
for passport verification.</i>

2027
01:53:01,458 --> 01:53:02,667
I'll be home in an hour.

2028
01:53:02,667 --> 01:53:04,708
<i>Are you crazy?
Why would the cops wait for you?</i>

2029
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:05,668
<i>Come fast!</i>

2030
01:53:15,583 --> 01:53:17,125
Why didn't you come to work, man?

2031
01:53:19,041 --> 01:53:20,500
I couldn't save dad.

2032
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,166
It's been 5 years
since dad left us.

2033
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:26,166
It was yesterday.

2034
01:53:27,083 --> 01:53:28,458
I spoke to Vennela.

2035
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:30,208
She met dad.

2036
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:33,166
Hey! Let's go out. Come on.
Your mood will get better.

2037
01:53:33,166 --> 01:53:34,333
You won't understand it.

2038
01:53:42,333 --> 01:53:43,333
Why are you here?

2039
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,917
There are a few files
on your computer.

2040
01:53:45,959 --> 01:53:47,125
I came to copy them.

2041
01:53:51,417 --> 01:53:52,417
Where is it?

2042
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:53,834
When did you dump them?

2043
01:53:53,834 --> 01:53:55,291
I copied it 6 months ago.

2044
01:53:56,959 --> 01:53:58,208
Yes! Found it!

2045
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:01,708
What did you say?

2046
01:54:01,834 --> 01:54:04,041
I said I copied it
6 months ago and I found it.

2047
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:19,041
I used to put my wishes
under the idol in my childhood.

2048
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:21,458
And, surprisingly,
each one of them would come true.

2049
01:55:10,834 --> 01:55:11,834
<i>Surya...</i>

2050
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:14,041
<i>I'm very sorry, Surya!</i>

2051
01:55:14,291 --> 01:55:16,208
<i>I couldn't save uncle!</i>

2052
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:19,583
<i>I don't know whether this letter
will reach you or not.</i>

2053
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,166
<i>But I hope this reaches you.</i>

2054
01:55:24,125 --> 01:55:26,250
<i>Surya, your dad loves you.</i>

2055
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:29,625
<i>He only had one last wish.
He has something for you.</i>

2056
01:56:42,667 --> 01:56:45,500
Sameer, we are participating
in the competition this year.

2057
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:50,583
Excuse me!
My SIM isn't activated yet.

2058
01:56:51,041 --> 01:56:52,500
‐Your name?
‐Vennela.

2059
01:56:52,542 --> 01:56:54,500
I was here yesterday asking for
same number as I lost my phone.

2060
01:56:54,583 --> 01:56:55,250
Oh, yes.

2061
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:57,792
We can activate the new sim
only if we deactivate the old sim.

2062
01:56:57,792 --> 01:56:59,708
We couldn't deactivate it
no matter how hard we tried.

2063
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:01,959
We don't know why.
I can get you a new number.

2064
01:57:07,125 --> 01:57:08,959
‐Hello, grandma.
<i>‐Where are you, dear?</i>

2065
01:57:09,041 --> 01:57:10,083
I'm going to meet Surya.

2066
01:57:10,083 --> 01:57:12,500
<i>I don't think
you're doing the right thing.</i>

2067
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:15,166
I should tell Surya
what has happened in 2014.

2068
01:57:15,458 --> 01:57:16,667
Please don't try to stop me.

2069
01:57:16,667 --> 01:57:17,708
I'll call you back.

2070
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:13,458
Sorry.

2071
01:58:13,542 --> 01:58:14,542
Thank you.

2072
01:58:16,834 --> 01:58:18,750
Excuse me. Is Surya home?

2073
01:58:18,917 --> 01:58:20,417
There he goes.

2074
01:58:22,542 --> 01:58:23,460
Surya!

2075
01:58:23,792 --> 01:58:24,710
Surya!

2076
01:58:25,667 --> 01:58:26,585
Surya!

2077
01:58:37,208 --> 01:58:38,126
Surya!

2078
01:58:56,792 --> 01:58:57,710
Surya!

2079
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:15,125
Hey, kids.

2080
02:00:15,166 --> 02:00:16,166
Come here.

2081
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:17,583
What is it?

2082
02:00:18,208 --> 02:00:19,375
Where did Surya go?

2083
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:21,375
He left to Kashi this morning.

2084
02:00:21,375 --> 02:00:22,583
‐Kashi?
‐Yes.

2085
02:00:25,583 --> 02:00:28,750
‐Do you know when he'll be back?
‐Maybe in a couple of days.

2086
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,500
Let's go.

2087
02:00:41,708 --> 02:00:43,166
Why are you crying, dear?

2088
02:00:44,417 --> 02:00:45,917
I don't understand
what's happening.

2089
02:00:46,959 --> 02:00:49,583
Something always goes wrong
whenever I try to meet Surya.

2090
02:00:51,125 --> 02:00:53,875
I can't call him either
because my phone's gone.

2091
02:00:55,417 --> 02:00:58,708
He's in Varanasi, and I don't know
when he'll be back.

2092
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,166
I have a flight to Germany
in 2 days.

2093
02:01:03,542 --> 02:01:06,000
I don't know what to do, grandma.

2094
02:01:11,625 --> 02:01:12,917
I'll also go to Varanasi.

2095
02:01:13,333 --> 02:01:15,417
I'll meet him there
and talk to him.

2096
02:01:15,417 --> 02:01:16,417
Listen.

2097
02:01:17,125 --> 02:01:18,417
You can't meet him.

2098
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:24,708
Think about it.

2099
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:31,083
If you had met him,
you would've been with him in 2019.

2100
02:01:31,542 --> 02:01:32,750
Are you guys together?

2101
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:37,333
You knew his father
was going to die.

2102
02:01:38,208 --> 02:01:39,291
Could you stop it?

2103
02:01:42,041 --> 02:01:43,291
It's his past.

2104
02:01:43,458 --> 02:01:44,458
It's over.

2105
02:01:45,417 --> 02:01:46,708
We can't change it.

2106
02:01:46,959 --> 02:01:49,542
If we could,
why would they call it fate?

2107
02:01:51,333 --> 02:01:57,208
The Creator himself
couldn't escape his fate.

2108
02:01:57,834 --> 02:01:58,959
We're just humans after all.

2109
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:00,875
What could we do?

2110
02:02:01,583 --> 02:02:02,792
Think about it.

2111
02:02:03,083 --> 02:02:05,583
What happened every time
you went to meet him?

2112
02:02:32,834 --> 02:02:34,458
Don't try to meet him.

2113
02:02:36,291 --> 02:02:37,750
Because you cannot.

2114
02:02:39,542 --> 02:02:41,291
Why did God bring us together then?

2115
02:02:41,625 --> 02:02:43,250
To separate us and make us sad?

2116
02:02:43,417 --> 02:02:46,834
God brought you together
like a miracle of destiny.

2117
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:50,250
Wonder why he separated you now.

2118
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:52,917
When will we meet again?

2119
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:59,750
Only fate knows
what it has in store for you.

2120
02:03:02,291 --> 02:03:05,333
The closer you go,
the more danger he'll be in.

2121
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,500
Listen to me.

2122
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:09,583
Go far away from him.

2123
02:03:13,291 --> 02:03:17,208
<i>"A small way"</i>

2124
02:03:20,291 --> 02:03:28,250
<i>"Can't meet yours"</i>

2125
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:47,166
<i>"I sent you away
When you're before me"</i>

2126
02:03:47,625 --> 02:03:54,000
<i>"I searched for you
When you're far away"</i>

2127
02:03:54,458 --> 02:04:00,834
<i>"I'm in this darkness
Where there is no way out"</i>

2128
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:08,041
<i>"These are the tears
That will stop with time"</i>

2129
02:04:08,125 --> 02:04:15,000
<i>"I am suffering
Being alone for a few years"</i>

2130
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:21,625
<i>"My world has changed
Since you came"</i>

2131
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:28,875
<i>"Come to me, my dear"</i>

2132
02:04:29,667 --> 02:04:35,417
<i>"I remained half
Come to me"</i>

2133
02:04:36,667 --> 02:04:42,959
<i>"Come to me, dear!"</i>

2134
02:04:43,417 --> 02:04:48,834
<i>"Walk towards me
And come to this side"</i>

2135
02:04:50,041 --> 02:04:51,542
Vennela's phone is switched off.

2136
02:04:51,959 --> 02:04:53,875
We are not able to reach her.

2137
02:04:54,417 --> 02:04:56,000
Can you please get me the details?

2138
02:04:56,708 --> 02:04:57,708
Okay, Surya.

2139
02:05:17,625 --> 02:05:20,542
<i>"I asked the motionless voice"</i>

2140
02:05:20,959 --> 02:05:24,083
<i>"Asked the stained eyes"</i>

2141
02:05:24,291 --> 02:05:29,375
<i>"They led me towards you"</i>

2142
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:37,208
<i>"You're the moonlight"</i>

2143
02:05:37,959 --> 02:05:43,959
<i>"Remove the darkness
From my life and come for me"</i>

2144
02:05:45,125 --> 02:05:50,750
<i>"My heartbeat stops
When I think of you"</i>

2145
02:05:51,917 --> 02:05:57,083
<i>"Quit playing games with me"</i>

2146
02:05:57,834 --> 02:06:04,708
<i>"This distance made me realise
The love I have for you"</i>

2147
02:06:04,792 --> 02:06:11,750
<i>"I went mute
When I stopped hearing your voice"</i>

2148
02:06:26,875 --> 02:06:32,708

02:06:33,291 --> 02:06:38,792

02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:46,417

<i>"Move the foot
And come to me, my girl"</i>

2156
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:48,625
‐Congrats, bro.
‐Thank you.

2157
02:07:48,625 --> 02:07:49,625
Thank you!

2158
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:52,583
‐Thank you!
‐That was an amazing performance.

2159
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:53,583
Thanks, dude.

2160
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:56,750
‐Congratulations.
‐You sang well, man. Congrats.

2161
02:07:56,959 --> 02:07:58,166
‐Good job, guys!
‐Surya!

2162
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:02,584
‐Hey! When did you come?
‐You were rocking.

2163
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:03,625
‐Thank you.
‐Amazing!

2164
02:08:03,625 --> 02:08:05,792
‐When did you come from Bangalore?
‐Surya!

2165
02:08:05,792 --> 02:08:07,792
He'll become the next Sid Sriram
if he works hard.

2166
02:08:07,792 --> 02:08:09,166
‐Correct!
‐That's true.

2167
02:08:10,333 --> 02:08:13,458
I found out why you and
Vennela have the same number.

2168
02:08:13,458 --> 02:08:14,209
Why?

2169
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:17,166
Nobody used her number
after she lost her phone.

2170
02:08:17,333 --> 02:08:18,834
You were given the same number.

2171
02:08:18,917 --> 02:08:20,959
That's how you both have
the same number.

2172
02:08:22,667 --> 02:08:24,583
Did you figure out
anything else about her?

2173
02:08:26,708 --> 02:08:28,959
Come outside.
I can't hear anything here.

2174
02:08:36,166 --> 02:08:37,583
Here. Your dad's belongings.

2175
02:08:41,792 --> 02:08:44,166
Our neighbours collected them
when we were in Kashi.

2176
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:47,458
Careful. Take care.

2177
02:09:04,041 --> 02:09:05,208
Tell me. What is it?

2178
02:09:05,875 --> 02:09:06,875
Surya...

2179
02:09:07,708 --> 02:09:08,708
Vennela...

2180
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Ah, Vennela?

2181
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:11,583
Did you find out anything
about her?

2182
02:09:11,708 --> 02:09:13,000
Vennela is no more, Surya.

2183
02:09:14,458 --> 02:09:16,291
Hey, what are you saying?

2184
02:09:18,125 --> 02:09:18,834
Look at this.

2185
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:27,542
She died today 5 years ago
in a road accident.

2186
02:09:29,959 --> 02:09:31,708
<i>Is Vennela the girl whom I loved?</i>

2187
02:10:16,542 --> 02:10:17,542
Hello, Vennela.

2188
02:10:19,041 --> 02:10:20,792
Hello. Whose phone is this?

2189
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:23,959
You... Where is Vennela?

2190
02:10:24,125 --> 02:10:25,125
Who's Vennela?

2191
02:10:25,417 --> 02:10:26,834
Your sister or girlfriend?

2192
02:10:26,834 --> 02:10:28,000
Hey! Who the hell are you?

2193
02:10:28,041 --> 02:10:29,875
Hey! First, you tell me.
Who the hell are you?

2194
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,834
I found your phone and thought of
returning it. Don't act up.

2195
02:10:32,917 --> 02:10:34,708
I'm already pissed.
Watch your tongue.

2196
02:10:34,792 --> 02:10:39,208
Did you steal her phone?
I'll kill you when I find you.

2197
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:41,375
Oh, really? I can't wait, dude.

2198
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:42,875
I dare you to come here.

2199
02:10:43,083 --> 02:10:45,083
Give me your address. I'm coming.

2200
02:10:45,083 --> 02:10:46,792
Note it down.
My name is Surya.

2201
02:10:46,834 --> 02:10:49,250
I live in Pragathi Nagar.
House number 303. Come here.

2202
02:10:50,917 --> 02:10:52,792
What's wrong, Surya? Who is it?

2203
02:10:54,667 --> 02:10:56,208
‐It's me.
‐What's going on?

2204
02:10:57,208 --> 02:10:59,208
‐What happened?
‐Surya...

2205
02:11:05,333 --> 02:11:07,583
Listen to me.
This is my girlfriend's phone.

2206
02:11:07,583 --> 02:11:09,083
I thought
somebody must've stolen it.

2207
02:11:09,125 --> 02:11:10,125
I'm sorry.

2208
02:11:10,667 --> 02:11:12,375
Okay, tell me.
Where do I bring the phone?

2209
02:11:12,375 --> 02:11:14,542
‐What's the time now?
‐4:30 p.m.

2210
02:11:14,625 --> 02:11:16,166
Can you do me a favour?

2211
02:11:16,333 --> 02:11:17,333
‐Please?
‐What?

2212
02:11:17,333 --> 02:11:18,875
You need to give this phone
to Vennela.

2213
02:11:18,875 --> 02:11:20,834
That too before 5:30 p.m.
Can you do that?

2214
02:11:20,834 --> 02:11:22,834
You have a timing set
for collecting your lost phone?

2215
02:11:22,834 --> 02:11:24,333
Please try to understand.

2216
02:11:24,375 --> 02:11:25,959
<i>I can't give any more details.</i>

2217
02:11:25,959 --> 02:11:27,250
<i>She's in big danger.</i>

2218
02:11:28,208 --> 02:11:29,208
Where is she?

2219
02:11:49,291 --> 02:11:50,834
Hello, Surya.
Where are you right now?

2220
02:11:57,917 --> 02:11:59,250
Yeah, I'm here at the temple.

2221
02:12:01,542 --> 02:12:02,542
Hey! Come here.

2222
02:12:03,083 --> 02:12:06,458
Do you know where LIC Rama Krishna,
Vennela's house is?

2223
02:12:06,458 --> 02:12:07,792
She's leaving in that car.

2224
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Leaving?

2225
02:12:13,083 --> 02:12:15,041
Please help me. Follow her, Surya!

2226
02:12:23,125 --> 02:12:24,834
Hello! I'm going. Almost there.

2227
02:12:25,583 --> 02:12:26,583
Go faster!

2228
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:28,500
I'm going.

2229
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:47,001
Hey!

2230
02:13:40,625 --> 02:13:41,667
Surya, what happened?

2231
02:13:45,625 --> 02:13:46,543
Hello?

2232
02:16:14,375 --> 02:16:15,583
<i>He is...</i>

2233
02:16:23,125 --> 02:16:24,125
<i>Surya's friend.</i>

2234
02:16:25,959 --> 02:16:27,291
Ma'am, where are you going?

2235
02:16:27,375 --> 02:16:28,375
Hold on! I will be back.

2236
02:16:44,875 --> 02:16:46,333
Nothing happened to you, right?

2237
02:16:47,208 --> 02:16:48,666
What was that in newspaper then?

2238
02:16:50,083 --> 02:16:54,165
When they found out that
I was alive, they changed the news.

2239
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,040
Didn't you watch?

2240
02:17:01,583 --> 02:17:03,250
Surya, I'm very sorry.

2241
02:17:03,583 --> 02:17:05,416
I couldn't save uncle.

2242
02:17:07,583 --> 02:17:10,000
As you said, everything is destiny.

2243
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:13,583
We can't change destiny.

2244
02:17:19,834 --> 02:17:22,583
You found out today
that the girl you loved

2245
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:24,708
and the girl you were talking to
are one and the same.

2246
02:17:25,375 --> 02:17:27,000
But I knew that 5 years back.

2247
02:17:28,083 --> 02:17:30,375
I had to go through
all the pain you did.

2248
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:34,250
Maybe that is why
God didn't let us meet.

2249
02:17:35,375 --> 02:17:37,834
I went to Germany,
finished my course and returned.

2250
02:17:40,125 --> 02:17:41,666
Where were you all this while?

2251
02:17:42,208 --> 02:17:43,333
I was around you.

2252
02:17:43,834 --> 02:17:45,416
‐Around me?
‐Yes.

2253
02:17:45,583 --> 02:17:48,290
Who did you think sent food
to you every morning?

2254
02:18:00,208 --> 02:18:04,040
<i>It was me who sent the umbrella
at the clock tower during the storm.</i>

2255
02:18:05,165 --> 02:18:07,416
<i>I tried to call you
many times, Surya.</i>

2256
02:18:08,208 --> 02:18:09,541
<i>But the line never connected.</i>

2257
02:18:12,416 --> 02:18:13,875
Hello! Hello, Surya!

2258
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:18,040
<i>Every time I wanted to meet,
you ended up in danger.</i>

2259
02:18:18,083 --> 02:18:19,001
Hey!

2260
02:18:23,208 --> 02:18:24,791
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

2261
02:18:25,916 --> 02:18:28,791
<i>So, I stayed away from you
even though I was around you.</i>

2262
02:18:29,416 --> 02:18:32,709
I waited these 5 years, Surya.

2263
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:48,916
When both phone calls got cut
seemed like the day we'd meet.

2264
02:18:49,458 --> 02:18:50,458
That's today.

2265
02:18:51,708 --> 02:18:54,040
I'm still scared
if something might happen to you.

2266
02:18:54,583 --> 02:18:57,040
I can't take it, Surya. I can't.

2267
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:03,458
You fulfilled your dream
in the competition today.

2268
02:19:03,959 --> 02:19:06,083
‐I was there.
‐Really?

2269
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:13,040
How did I play?

2270
02:19:14,916 --> 02:19:16,250
You sang for me.

2271
02:19:17,834 --> 02:19:18,834
So, it was beautiful.

2272
02:19:20,250 --> 02:19:22,125
I should tell grandma
that we have met.

2273
02:19:22,541 --> 02:19:23,791
She'll be overwhelmed.

2274
02:19:23,916 --> 02:19:25,208
Is your granny still alive?

2275
02:19:26,416 --> 02:19:27,416
Alive.

2276
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:29,083
By the way, what's Prasad up to?

2277
02:19:29,083 --> 02:19:33,000
He's calling his own number,
trying to get a girl.

2278
02:19:33,834 --> 02:19:35,250
<i>Some stories have truths.</i>

2279
02:19:35,625 --> 02:19:37,125
<i>Some stories have lies.</i>

2280
02:19:37,458 --> 02:19:40,959
<i>The stories far from these
are miraculous.</i>
