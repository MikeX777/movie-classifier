1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,433
Halt!

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,078
Halt!

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,638
Halt!

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,955
Lizard

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,154
Come in

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,072
Come on

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,518
Hi, there!

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,518
Hello, Mr. Reza Mesghali

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,798
At your service

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,992
Your record is really a mess

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,311
That's life!

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,949
It seems we have to
spend a lot of time together

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,719
The rest of your life to be exact

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,149
Excuse me, Mr. Mojavez

15
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,755
but I am not staying here long,
they've made a mistake

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,117
Really!

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,754
I've got me a lawyer, I've appealed

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,314
You have asked for an appeal, of course!

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,797
Whatever... you know, sir I ain't
into armed robbery and all that!

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,118
No stealin' and no drinkin'
in the holy months

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,070
I've never even held a blowgun in my life

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,873
- I've been framed
- Are you finished?

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,633
I don't know you, do I?

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,775
I refer to the case in front of me

25
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:58,790
which says you're a disturbed person

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,070
It tells me you've been imprisoned
several times for different crimes

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,714
but you have never reformed

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,071
It tells me that you
are a danger to society

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,033
- Yeah, but...
- Don't interrupt me, son!

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,269
I stated the facts

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,676
- But I think you're a good person
- Cool, man!

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,189
Everyone is good

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,598
Even an armed robber like you

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,439
Don't interrupt me!

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,797
Do you know why people go on diet?

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,911
Well, to get thinner

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,470
To get thinner and for their health

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,437
I believe we have to go on
a diet for our spiritual health

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,872
So this is not a prison,
and I am not the prison warden

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,470
- It's a spiritual clinic
- Wow!

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:02,474
And you are patients who come here to
gain your spiritual health through my diet

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,592
I will send you to heaven
even if I have to use force

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,632
- What was so funny about that?
- Nothing

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,799
the part about how you wanna
send us to heaven was a little cute!

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,471
Yes, it sounds strange, but it can be done

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,831
Provided that you follow
the spiritual diet I prescribe

47
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,110
Although it is not so easy

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,597
Soldier! Take our friend
to the solitary confinement!

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,869
Why to the solitary?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,753
First, so you do not interrupt me again

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,474
Second, so you do not laugh at my words

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,319
And third, because solitary
is good for people like you

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,273
You will thank me later

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,471
Take him away

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,317
Mr. Mesghali!

56
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,469
Welcome to your new home

57
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,273
- How long you're in for, colonel?
- Take your hand off!

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,638
Keeps asking questions!

59
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:19,993
Hi, there

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,870
Are you done? Come on

61
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,152
Get out...

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,718
Get going

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,832
Oh, the poor thing is stuck!

64
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,673
Hey, can't you get it loose?

65
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,365
I tried, but my shirt got torn, look

66
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,391
Then shoot it and
put it out of its misery

67
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,718
I've gotta answer for my bullets

68
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:40,677
Otherwise I'd shoot ten crows a day

69
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,433
If you don't shoot it,
I'll come up and set it free

70
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:45,192
Come up? How?

71
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,245
- The wall
- This wall? How?

72
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,396
- I'll grab it and climb up
- Bullshit!

73
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,594
- I'll bet you
- I'll take the bet

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,879
- How much do you bet?
- Tonight's dinner

75
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,109
- Okay
- Okay

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,753
Making bets?

77
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:59,033
Hello!

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,594
I am willing to make a bet

79
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,431
Betting in itself isn't wrong
so long as it doesn't turn into gambling

80
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,071
So you say you can climb
this wall without a ladder?

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,758
Well, yeah

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,756
So we will make a bet
in front of these friends

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,799
If you climb this wall, you won't

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,679
do any chores for a whole week

85
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,439
and if you don't, you'll spend
another week in solitary, how's that?

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,477
You can't! It's impossible

87
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,599
I'm in

88
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,632
- Go on and show what you can do
- He's lyin'

89
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,072
With your permission

90
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,918
Go! Go! Right on, man! Come on up!

91
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,565
He climbs like Spiderman

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,434
Hey bro, don't take it too far
when we smile at you for five minutes

93
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,119
Get down now

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,352
Well done

95
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,114
Thanks man

96
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,317
You won the bet and did a good deed

97
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:58,878
Take him to the solitary

98
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,965
Solitary? Are you kiddin'?

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,757
No, you are going to the solitary
to quit the bad habit of climbing

100
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:08,792
especially climbing prison walls

101
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,593
You coward!

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,925
No, I'm not going back on my word

103
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,557
You can rest for a whole
week, but in the solitary

104
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:21,592
Don't make any noise

105
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,752
Your appeal was rejected

106
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,310
You're going to be our guest
for a long time, get inside

107
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,314
I said get inside

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,596
I fell in love with my wife
the first time I saw her

109
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,155
But when I stopped lovin'

110
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:59,830
her, she stopped breathin'

111
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:00,078
Now I like you

112
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,193
For now!

113
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,654
You're an important guy

114
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,629
Don't worry about the bunks

115
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,032
You take the bottom one

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,565
And I'll take the top, I'm so tired

117
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,556
Not from there, can't you
see I've cleaned it! From here

118
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,358
I changed my mind, I'll take
the bottom bunk, you take the top one

119
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:25,393
That side is still clean

120
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,618
You seem angry with me!

121
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,517
You guys don't understand

122
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,125
I only want to cure you

123
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,628
Believe me it's a difficult task

124
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,113
Do you know how?

125
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,638
How what?

126
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,312
To pray?

127
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,277
Well yeah, but I've forgotten

128
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,918
Everyone's forgotten

129
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,005
Ain't nothing to it, just bend down...

130
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,474
A mosque is no place for
this behavior, remember that

131
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,231
Take him to the solitary

132
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,712
Get up

133
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,954
Come on! Get inside

134
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:51,198
Come on!

135
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,835
From now on it's going to be like this

136
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,912
Why don't you eat?

137
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,319
If my late wife could cook
like this, she'd be alive now!

138
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,469
Okay, it ain't the end of the world

139
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,710
You should thank God
you've got your health

140
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:36,645
Would you rather be free but have no?

141
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,717
It was my fault, I started it, should I go?

142
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,910
- Where?
- To the solitary

143
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,114
No, son

144
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,557
All inmates who are sentenced
to life are rowdy at first

145
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:14,592
But soon they get used to it

146
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,516
I hope it will be a happy life together

147
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:22,032
Sit down, son, sit down and eat

148
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,514
Take this one to the solitary

149
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,869
Let's go

150
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,639
- He said that one
- Move

151
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:35,845
My teardrops fell

152
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:46,996
My eyes became seas
in my teardrops

153
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:47,031
your shadow appeared

154
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,353
Colonel, let me clean your glasses

155
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,716
Mind your own business,
get on with your work!

156
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:07,751
Come on!

157
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,077
Go

158
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,113
To hell with it, I'll appeal again

159
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,395
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'

160
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,711
Are you going to kill yourself!?

161
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,832
I said I ain't doin' nothin'

162
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,885
Look the other way, put that glass away

163
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,956
I said I ain't gonna do nothin',
go and watch soccer

164
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:33,993
So you can go kill yourself
in peace? I won't let you

165
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:35,274
Damn it, leave me alone

166
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,191
You coward, suicide is a sin

167
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,395
If you take one more pill,
I'll kill you with my own hands

168
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,915
Look what you did? I cut my arm

169
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,518
You cut it?

170
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,317
Where?

171
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,590
Here!

172
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,195
Hello, brother

173
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,995
Hello

174
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,872
Looks like you were very
hopeless to want to...

175
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:21,434
Say whatever you want,
but don't preach me

176
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:21,469
I didn't intend to preach you

177
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,036
I just wanted to say that at
such times you may rely on God

178
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:28,071
Rely on God for what?

179
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,830
I live like a dog, I get no respect

180
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:35,159
they beat me on the head

181
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,794
and then they say rely on God

182
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,678
The heaven and hell that everyone says...

183
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,073
Sorry to interrupt, but
heaven and hell are nonsense

184
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:48,108
It's for foolin' folks like you and me

185
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,872
They say these things to fool us

186
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:53,199
Who?

187
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,592
The Mullahs

188
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,319
Of course the Mullahs have
bad and good among them too

189
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,694
Yeah, they bought the
good ones at a high price

190
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,034
they're waitin' to sell
'em in the right season

191
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,671
Colonel, you didn't tell me
how long you've been here?

192
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,399
Ah! How many times do you ask? Get going

193
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,599
Look at these muscles, dude

194
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,165
Get inside

195
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,513
I see you are much better today

196
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,910
My health doesn't get
any better or worse

197
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,919
Sorry about this man,
we didn't have any empty beds

198
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:46,719
It's okay! Actually we
became friends right away

199
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,037
our friend has a lot of
respect for the clergy

200
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,989
Oh, how nice

201
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,036
Goodbye

202
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,396
I'm really ashamed, sir

203
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,350
And who better than us, Mullahs?

204
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,479
My name is Reza

205
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,876
My name's Reza too

206
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,799
You know, Hajji

207
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,948
if I hadn't seen your clothes,
I'd never think you're a Mullah

208
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:26,983
How come?

209
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,953
Your hands don't look
like the hands of a Mullah

210
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:31,312
Because being a Mullah
is not my profession

211
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:32,189
What d'ya mean?

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,597
I'm a plaster-moulder,
traditional plaster-molding

213
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:38,632
It's my forefathers' profession

214
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,485
- Is that possible?
- Why not?

215
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,796
Man is worthy of honor
for his soul and humanity

216
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,878
Beautiful attire do not reflect his worth

217
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,790
Right on, man! Humanity!

218
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:51,958
How is it, doc?

219
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,645
Good, I think you can
be released tomorrow

220
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,519
But, Doc, I ain't feelin' well yet

221
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,358
I feel weak, my arm hurts

222
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:05,036
Do you want me to recommend
that you stay here for a week?

223
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,272
I'd appreciate that

224
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,798
No way, I'll tell them
to take you tomorrow

225
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,557
I don't wanna go back to that hell-hole

226
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,239
If I go back,
I'll cut my artery

227
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,959
Have you lost hope again, Reza?

228
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,798
Do you know what, Hajji?

229
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,710
Even if there is a hell
I'll end up in the worst part of it

230
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:47,745
No, dear brother!

231
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,799
There are as many ways to
reach God as there are people

232
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:53,834
What?

233
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,669
I said there are as many ways
to reach God as there are people

234
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:01,704
What does that mean?

235
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,469
It means that God doesn't
close all his doors on his people

236
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:07,832
Don't lose hope

237
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,353
Excuse my language, but do you
Mullahs have to preach all the time?

238
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,357
No, we're not the only ones who preach

239
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,316
Listen!

240
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,885
People buy everything from stores

241
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,878
But since there are no
stores that sell friends

242
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,758
they can't buy friends
and they feel lonely

243
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,190
if you want a friend, tame me

244
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,396
He asked: What does tame mean?

245
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,725
The fox said: It means make me love you

246
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,035
and this is something that
is totally forgotten nowadays

247
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,550
He asked: How can I do that?

248
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,029
The fox said: You have to
have patience, a lot of patience

249
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,510
So they've got preachers
all over the world then

250
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
That's right, my dear brother

251
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,831
Say hi to him for me

252
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,351
Peace be upon you too...

253
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,597
I'll take a shower before
they come to get you

254
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,274
I had a great time Hajji

255
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,995
I had never hung out
with a cool Mullah before

256
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,437
I had a great time too

257
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,715
I had never hung around
with a cool prisoner like you before

258
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,317
- Hello, Hajji
- Peace be upon you

259
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,439
Fereshteh Street!

260
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,909
Fereshteh Street!

261
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,712
Damn it!

262
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,313
Fereshteh Street?

263
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,872
I didn't wanna trouble you

264
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,615
No trouble, Hajji,
we owe you a lot more than this

265
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,550
Thank you, I've been
hangin' there for a long time

266
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,229
Yes, people have become very bad,
they have no respect any more

267
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,835
Unfortunately, that's how it is

268
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,548
Dear brother, this is the wrong way

269
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,748
What wrong way, Hajji? This is
a reserved lane for special traffic

270
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,675
and I have a special passenger

271
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,218
Hello? Hello? Yes? I'm coming

272
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:57,516
I'll be there in two minutes

273
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,672
I'm taking a shortcut

274
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,217
Oh fine, now the cops are here

275
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:05,274
Registration and drivers license

276
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,805
Hello, officer

277
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,834
Hajji is in a hurry, and that's
why we came this way, Hajji

278
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:15,869
Hello, officer, how are you?

279
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,591
We apologize and promise
it won't happen again

280
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:24,469
It better not happen again, go ahead

281
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,595
Pardon me, but Fereshteh
Street is not this way!

282
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,550
Oh! Fereshteh?

283
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,845
Hajji, I thought you said Ferdowsi

284
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,749
Sorry, but I'm late and I have
to make a turn here, I'm sorry

285
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:47,876
No problem

286
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,273
Have you heard the poem

287
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,278
mother took me by the hand
and taught me to walk?

288
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:57,313
This two G's for Ferdowsi street

289
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,715
This two for Fereshteh street
and two for the one way street

290
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,836
You left your wallet in my pocket!

291
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,591
Hello

292
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,378
Yes?

293
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:21,477
Who?

294
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,997
All right!

295
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,988
Are you Brother Jackson?

296
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,028
Yes?

297
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,165
You are under arrest for smuggling
and purchasing stolen goods

298
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,115
- Uh! Hajji you are making a mistake!
- You jackass! It's me! Reza!

299
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,117
You idiot! What's this?

300
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,191
I've become his hollyness Mullah Reza

301
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:04,714
So everything's cool?

302
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,845
I don't have to say it again now!

303
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,032
I don't want him to get into any trouble

304
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,038
Bye!

305
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,513
Is he a cool dude?

306
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,833
This Mahmoud Motazedi
is sharper than you think

307
00:25:27,868 --> 00:25:27,868
Don't look at his age

308
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,993
He can forge passports

309
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,517
that even the passport office...
can't tell if it's original or fake

310
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:35,758
His hang out is Mozafari teahouse

311
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,951
He'll pick you up at the train station

312
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,998
You'll just get your passport
it's all been paid for

313
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:42,513
Thanks a lot, man

314
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,355
For instance, one of the unique

315
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:48,631
capabilities used in
the internet is chatting

316
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,249
Internet, chat, multimedia

317
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:51,833
What are you talking about?

318
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,365
Mullahs don't talk like this

319
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,517
- Look! Then what's this?
- This is an exception

320
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:01,840
You better talk like regular Mullahs

321
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,839
Look!

322
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,591
We will continue our discussion of
salvation in ultimate darkness...

323
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:09,626
by reviewing the movie Pulp fiction

324
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,445
Jackson, they talk about everything

325
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,392
Like this... what did
he say? Pul fiction?

326
00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:17,037
- Pulp fiction
- What does it mean?

327
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,165
It's the name of a movie,
eat your dinner

328
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,320
As Tarantino says: I want
to be where God wants me

329
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:25,355
Hello

330
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,797
What a hell raiser! God bless him

331
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,516
Hello

332
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,830
Hey, Hajji, your turban is backwards!

333
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:51,876
Shove off...

334
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,525
God bless you all

335
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,233
Give my regards to your mother!

336
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,556
Welcome, Hajji, peace be upon you

337
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,469
Peace and God's mercy be upon you

338
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,351
Please come this way

339
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,675
You should be comfortable here

340
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,638
I'm flattened by your kindness

341
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,631
God willing, during the trip,
we will use your grace's presence

342
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,669
Yes, yes, may God accept

343
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,673
With your permission

344
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,079
What!

345
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,957
Peace and God's mercy be upon you

346
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,405
Peace and God's mercy
and benevolence be upon you

347
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,755
Hajji, is it okay
with you if a passenger

348
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,070
sits here temporarily,
until the next station?

349
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:22,717
- Please, no problem
- Go on in

350
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,078
Hello

351
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,590
I'm really sorry, there were
no empty family compartments

352
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,319
and I thought next to you would
be the safest place for these ladies

353
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,599
Yes, they'll be safe here

354
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,270
They will only bother
you until the next station

355
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,519
What bother? It's an honor

356
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:53,759
With your permission

357
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,845
Please sit down, Lady

358
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,916
- Forgive me, Hajji
- No problem

359
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,350
My legs were falling off from moving
from one compartment to another

360
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:05,433
Yes!

361
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,433
What can I say, Hajji?

362
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,159
He was this big, but
his... was only this big

363
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:13,285
Oh, my God! What are you saying?

364
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,445
Dear, Mullahs are like doctors,
you can confide in them

365
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,598
Yes, if you don't tell these things
to us, who're you gonna tell?

366
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,797
Yes, you were saying, Lady

367
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,071
Yes, forget about his
problem, he hit her, Hajji

368
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:31,628
Oh God, we ask for
your forgiveness and...

369
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:31,663
To you we repent

370
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,525
To you we repent,
some people are really bad

371
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,236
Yes, Hajji, Faezeh's body
was always black and blue

372
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:44,271
Faezeh, show your bruise to Hajji

373
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,713
But I can't, mum

374
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,589
I filed a complaint and
got my daughter's divorce

375
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,951
Oh my God, what hardship
you've been through

376
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,108
He still wants Faezeh
he keeps asking her to o back to himg

377
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,550
But I said shut up, over my
dead body can you have her

378
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,405
Don't you make that
mistake, Lady Faezeh

379
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,513
No, Hajji, the three years I lived
with him was enough for a lifetime

380
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:27,235
Please pray for her, Hajji
pray she finds a good husband

381
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,792
God willing, a hot dish...

382
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,579
I mean a modest, smart lady like

383
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,119
her, won't be hard to pass off...

384
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:37,645
What happened?

385
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,511
Nothing, she fell asleep

386
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,593
So fast?

387
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,750
Yes, she always falls
asleep all of a sudden

388
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,165
How nice, poor child

389
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,431
What has that degenerate
man done to you?

390
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:00,357
May God punish him

391
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,072
Yes, I think he loved me you know!

392
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,873
But he was a brute

393
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,548
Yes, they should cut off the hands
of a man who'd hit a lady like you

394
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,426
Thank you, Hajji,
can you close that window?

395
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:14,270
My mother is not well,
she'll catch a cold

396
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,236
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes

397
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,633
Thank God, okay, I'll get the window

398
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:24,797
Uh! What happened, Hajji?

399
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,150
Nothing, I'm stuck

400
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,791
I'll get it out right away

401
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,317
Do you want me to pull
the emergency breaks?

402
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,717
Don't touch the brakes,
I will fix it myself

403
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,516
Thank you, God bless you

404
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,993
Forgive us, Hajji, the windows are
rusty and they get stuck sometimes

405
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,269
No problem

406
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,517
Okay, sisters, take your stuff

407
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,765
Hajji wants to be comfortable

408
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,634
No, I am comfortable, where are
you taking them? Let them stay here!

409
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:26,394
We have an empty family
compartment now, let's go

410
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,878
Goodbye, Hajji

411
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,550
You know how we Mullahs are

412
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:38,631
We love having company

413
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:38,666
Please stay

414
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,471
I've thought about
finding you company too

415
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,885
Go right ahead, gentlemen

416
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,434
Peace and God's mercy
and benevolence be upon you

417
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,635
I bear witness that there is no
God but the one and Only God

418
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,725
I have gone there
15 times already this year

419
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,639
The good thing is that you don't
need a visa, you only need a passport

420
00:33:01,674 --> 00:33:01,798
Right colonel?

421
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,679
I don't know much about there

422
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,178
What's the meaning
of that, colonel?

423
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:10,445
We want to provide a service to people

424
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,074
Those are customs regulations,
I don't know about them

425
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,598
Where do you work?

426
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,111
I am in the criminal investigation
department, we catch thieves

427
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:24,477
May God reward you

428
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,285
You're providing a service

429
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,675
Looks like we have
to get off for prayers

430
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,398
We will hold a mass prayer
because of your presence Hajji

431
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,957
We'll get two pence more out of it

432
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:46,394
Me? But I, if you allow me...

433
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,757
So you said you are a preacher Hajji?

434
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,393
With your permission

435
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,998
You are going to your mosque then?

436
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,885
- If God accepts me
- God willing

437
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,878
They say you have to pull
your hand down to the hairline

438
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:08,913
How far should I go?

439
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,236
Do what "Rostam" did, my dear
brother, come on, it's getting late

440
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:17,232
Hajji Amiri, come do your
ablution, the train will leave soon

441
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:17,795
Which mosque are you going to, Hajji?

442
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,756
Al-Amir mosque, if I'm not mistaken

443
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,829
Al-Amir? Where is that?

444
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,114
It should be around here

445
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,796
You see, Hajji? A train full of people

446
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:35,161
and less than 20
people come for prayers!

447
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:36,227
There are some folks who
don't even know how to pray

448
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,197
Shall we line up, Hajji?

449
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,153
Line what up?

450
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,565
Hajji is kidding, please, Hajji

451
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,038
When I'm praying
I totally forget the time

452
00:34:58,073 --> 00:34:58,073
Please pray for us, Hajji

453
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,714
That's what I meant

454
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,274
May God accept our prayers, Hajji

455
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,938
- Exactly
- Please pray for us, too

456
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:52,325
Okay, I hope you all, God willing

457
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,405
Dear brother, I didn't
want to trouble you

458
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,989
What trouble, Hajji?
We were taken by your virtues

459
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,479
Don't say that, your virtues
were much better than mine

460
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,395
I wanted to ask you
something in private, Hajji

461
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,199
Excuse me!

462
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,878
I am constantly traveling and
I'm always away from my family

463
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,516
and that puts a lot of pressure on me!

464
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:19,076
I understand, get to the point

465
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,793
What are the temporary
marriage laws for people like us?

466
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,353
You don't know what a
heaven they have there!

467
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:26,749
Unlawful

468
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,315
You mean there isn't any
other way? Any exceptions?

469
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:32,885
No, that is totally unlawful

470
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,275
And it is written that whoever does that

471
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,575
the angels will spit on him
and he will die a terrible death

472
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,431
and Satan will personally
service your mouth to his mouth

473
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:45,309
Better to just have a pleasant trip!

474
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,156
- Let's go, Hajji
- Where to?

475
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,992
I will drop you off at Amir Mosque

476
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,149
I don't want to trouble you

477
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,472
No trouble at all, Hajji,
let's go, the car is waiting

478
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:58,010
Actually they are going to pick me up

479
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:58,514
Really? You're not just saying that?

480
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,429
No, I think they must
be right around here...

481
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,317
Hajji, they have come for you!

482
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:06,792
Welcome Hajji

483
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:07,233
I am Hajji Fazly

484
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,039
This Hajji is a very great
man and a true believer

485
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,512
Don't take him for granted

486
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,045
I can tell just by looking at him

487
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,278
I think there has been a mistake
I'm supposed to go to some mosque

488
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:19,313
That's our mosque, Hajji

489
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,435
We knew you were coming a week ago

490
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,950
We wrote so many letters to the prayer
organization that we finally got results

491
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:28,985
Well, thank God

492
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,556
Excuse me, what's the
name of your mosque?

493
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,525
- Amir mosque, Hajji
- Didn't I tell you?

494
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,597
Everything is correct, Sir!
I leave Hajji in your hands then

495
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:40,673
- Allow me
- Good luck, Hajji

496
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,714
How nice! This was our Hajji?

497
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,192
Why? Do you know him?

498
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,356
Yes, we were in the same train
come up, Hajji, welcome

499
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:52,671
Then why didn't you tell us, Hajji?

500
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,995
I didn't? I thought I did!

501
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,670
Anyhow, I hope God gives me
the service to offer you my strength

502
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,630
Please Hajji,
please sit in the front, Hajji

503
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,074
I want to get some
fresh air if you allow me

504
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,198
- No way, please take the front seat
- I just want some fresh sir, please

505
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:09,909
With your permission we'll be going now

506
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:12,037
Why don't you leave?

507
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,392
We've got a flat tyre, you go on, Hajji

508
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,594
- Take care of yourself
- Good luck

509
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,519
Excuse me can you tell me where
the border and customhouse is?

510
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:27,554
The border patrol station
is 5 km from our village

511
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,953
Right

512
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,831
And can people cross
the border from there?

513
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,952
Yes, but the regulations are strict

514
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,554
Because there are too many smugglers
and thieves trying to cross this border

515
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,071
they only allow people
with passports to across

516
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:43,949
I see!

517
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,670
May we be excused, Hajji?

518
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,965
Come this way, Hajji

519
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,878
You go on, I'll escort these dear souls

520
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:52,565
I also ask your permission

521
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,194
We live right around here,
please come and visit us

522
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,717
Thank you, I sure will, God willing

523
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,874
Peace be upon you, sir

524
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,595
Well, the new Mullah, hi there

525
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,518
- Leave him alone, Javad
- I won't bother him!

526
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:10,110
My name's Javad Delangiz,
at your service

527
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,317
Glad to meet you

528
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,471
It shows on your face

529
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,875
Are you comin' back from Tehran now?

530
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,358
What's it to you? You're
not her husband anymore

531
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,829
Let me carry your bag

532
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,640
No need! We don't need
your help, let's go Faezeh

533
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:26,751
Excuse us, Hajji, goodbye

534
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:27,518
Are you leaving?

535
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,198
God be with you

536
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,319
Hajji Ahmadi, this way please,
they're waiting for you

537
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:35,758
- I'll be seein' you, Hajji
- Yes, do so, I'd like that

538
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:36,436
This way, Hajji

539
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,598
It's been more than a year that
our mosque hasn't had a clergy

540
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,595
but I've kept its light burning

541
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,517
As you see, this is the roofed summer time
altar, the main section is on the other side

542
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:50,285
We have a few chambers around here

543
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,834
We hold the 'Komeil'
prayer every thursday

544
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,896
We hold Koran classes for the
youth and I teach them myself

545
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:01,205
Unfortunately very few people
come to the mosque, Hajji

546
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,835
Now that Hajji has come here, God willing,
our mosque will prosper like old times again

547
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,958
You're practically a Mullah yourself

548
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,672
You lead prayers, you teach
Koran, you've got it all down

549
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:13,965
Actually my father was a Mullah

550
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,549
But certain turns in my life
made me unable to continue

551
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,999
Thank God, Gholamali has
chosen to follow his grandfather

552
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,757
Thank God

553
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,357
He knows four sections
of the Koran by heart, Hajji!

554
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,285
- Six sections, Hajji!
- Wow! Praise the Lord

555
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,788
God willing, he is going to
memorize all the Koran this year

556
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,912
He's going to enter
the national competition

557
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,357
God willing

558
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,559
But he has to work hard at it

559
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,845
When you love the Koran,
it won't be hard at all

560
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,839
God willing, he'll become a champ
and join the national soccer team

561
00:41:44,874 --> 00:41:44,874
- May I ask you a question, Hajji?
- Sure

562
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,957
You have done studies
in theological cognition?

563
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,954
No, I've spent my whole life in Qom

564
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:55,070
These are your quarters, Hajji

565
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,276
You must forgive us, but
this was the best we could afford

566
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,193
Don't mention it, it's a great place!

567
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,005
You have put up a lot of effort

568
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,951
- Is this the getaway?
- Pardon me?

569
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,116
- I mean the gateway
- Yes, sort of

570
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:10,629
I have a question, Hajji

571
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,431
Don't ask so many questions, Mojtaba

572
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,357
Hajji is tired, ask him at
prayer, with your permission

573
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:18,205
God be with you

574
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,596
I want these two handsome
youngsters to stay, I want to talk to them

575
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,019
As you wish, Hajji

576
00:42:24,054 --> 00:42:25,239
At your service, Hajji

577
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,870
Well, dear ones, now tell
me how you do your ablution

578
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:34,798
and how many sections
does each prayer have?

579
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:35,119
Yes, hajji, in the name of God

580
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,790
Morning prayer has two sections,
noon and evening prayers have four

581
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:43,119
and the night prayer has three sections

582
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,232
Don't be so upset, Mojaver

583
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,795
A prisoner's job is to escape

584
00:42:51,796 --> 00:42:55,430
and ours is to catch him

585
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,516
You don't get the point, Major

586
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,598
This had never happened
in my prison before

587
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,952
This man has ruined my reputation

588
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:18,968
Look, he can't go anywhere

589
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:21,949
We've put out an A.P. B on him

590
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,150
We have put surveillance on everyone
who has been in contact with him

591
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,557
their phones are tapped

592
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,033
One mistake and he will be arrested
what else do you want?

593
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:35,118
Think about it, Mojaver

594
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,396
If none of the prisoners escape,
what's the use of a warden?

595
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,645
Hajji is here, praise his holyness

596
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,513
- Please lead, Mr. Fazly
- Please, Hajji

597
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,800
I mean it, makes no difference,
I'd be more comfortable that way

598
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,499
Thanks, Hajji, we're at your service

599
00:43:59,534 --> 00:44:01,719
Well, call the "Azan" so we can begin

600
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,478
- I already called
- Called who?

601
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,837
- The "Azan", sir
- Right

602
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:10,234
Why are you standing there?

603
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,199
I'm here to say the praises, sir

604
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,519
Okay

605
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,085
- Deliver a sermon for us, Hajji
- A what?

606
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,112
These folks haven't come
to the pulpit for a long time

607
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,829
Give us a sermon

608
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,634
You mean pray again?

609
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,789
No, I mean preach for us, Hajji

610
00:44:45,824 --> 00:44:48,346
Oh, you mean up there

611
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:48,405
Umm... in the name of God

612
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,797
Today, that for the first time

613
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,713
I am with you respectful citizens

614
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,107
I am very happy to be

615
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:31,454
present in this radiant crowd

616
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:34,818
I want to tell you what

617
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:38,148
we are going to discuss today

618
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:39,789
It's about the different
ways of finding God

619
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,833
Which are as many as there are people

620
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,833
Well, what does that mean?

621
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,717
It means that for you, for example,

622
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:07,874
there is a path for
you that leads to God

623
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:11,915
And there is another path
for the person next to you

624
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:11,950
- For you...
- Me?

625
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,279
No, the man in the blue coat behind you

626
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,349
- Me?
- Yes

627
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,271
There is a path for
you that leads to God

628
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,194
For Mr. Fazly there is a path
that leads to God too

629
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:33,473
For the baker, the butcher, the prisoner...

630
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:34,273
Yes, pay attention to this word

631
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,894
There is also a path for that miserable

632
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:42,989
criminal prisoner that leads to God

633
00:46:43,024 --> 00:46:45,851
Now that I mentioned prisoners,

634
00:46:45,852 --> 00:46:48,679
I want to tell you something

635
00:46:48,714 --> 00:46:50,035
Imagine you want to enter a house, okay?

636
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,191
There are several ways for that

637
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,605
You can use the key
and open the door, okay?

638
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,885
But if you don't have a key,
the other option is a master key

639
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,294
If you don't have a master key, you can

640
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:15,669
use a piece of wire,
clippers, a screwdriver

641
00:47:15,704 --> 00:47:18,565
Or you may climb the wall
use a rope, and so on

642
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,470
Now sometimes you may want to climb
the neighbor's wall to enter the house

643
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,314
In my opinion that's okay too
that's another way that leads to God

644
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,417
Of course provided that you don't bother

645
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:42,075
the neighbors, in my
opinion that's alright too

646
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,933
Anyhow, there is no person in the world

647
00:47:44,934 --> 00:47:47,757
who doesn't have a path to reach God

648
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:49,834
I mean God has given people

649
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:51,876
lots of paths and they all lead to...

650
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,149
God!

651
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,638
God! Well done, that was so cool

652
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,828
Okay, that ends today's
sermon, as simple as that

653
00:48:11,863 --> 00:48:11,959
May God be with all of you

654
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,038
- That was an interesting sermon, Hajji
- Don't mention it

655
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,797
- Inquiry, Hajji!
- What?

656
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,113
Question, Hajji

657
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,356
The value of "Al-Qadr Night"
is more than 1000 months, why?

658
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:40,365
I'll let Mr. Fazly answer this question

659
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,436
because I want to see how
much religious knowledge he has

660
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,275
Please, Mr. Fazly

661
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,638
No offense Hajji

662
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,469
Because on this night God
sends the angels down

663
00:48:54,504 --> 00:48:55,845
and determines the
events of a whole year

664
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,475
praying on this night is more
valuable than praying for 1000 months

665
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,755
Applaud him

666
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,031
It's truly amazed!

667
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,699
Well done to all of you for being such

668
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,932
knowledgable and literate believers

669
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:12,165
- Well done
- I have another...

670
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,316
Allow me to answer
you in the next session

671
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,799
I want to go for a
pilgrimage to the shrine

672
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,710
Let us be together tonight, Hajji

673
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,790
We have prepared a simple dinner

674
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,736
God willing, tomorrow
I will take you wherever you want

675
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:32,913
Thank God, I hadn't had
such good chow in a long time

676
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:32,948
You must forgive us, Hajji

677
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,274
I'm sure it wasn't as good
as what you eat at home

678
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,189
It was much better

679
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,868
- Inquiry!
- Yes?

680
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,076
Hajji, in the North Pole we have six
months of nights and six months of days

681
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:46,405
How do we say our day
and night prayers over there?

682
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,000
You look at me as if you have
a bus ticket for the North Pole

683
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:50,318
and you want to leave right now!

684
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,365
Actually, there are differences
among the clergy over this issue

685
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,615
Some of them believe that we Muslems
should never go to the North Pole

686
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,830
because we are used to warm climates
and the cold weather will bother us

687
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,139
Why should we go to a place
where we might freeze to death?

688
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:11,421
Then, if a war breaks out between
the Muslems and North pole

689
00:50:11,456 --> 00:50:14,668
What would happen to a Muslem
who might be taken captive?

690
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,678
Yes!

691
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,191
Actually this is what
the other clergy say

692
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,279
All the prayers that you say
during the six months of night

693
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:30,158
will be considered
as night prayers and so...

694
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,869
To hell with the North Pole

695
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,633
Say your prayers according to
the local time of your own country

696
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:38,668
Then if we take that...

697
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,911
Case closed, eat your yoghurt!

698
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,277
One of the locals has a very good voice,

699
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:49,995
he wants to sing a song
if you would allow it

700
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,390
Of course, why not? Actually
reciting a song helps your digestion

701
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:50,425
Please

702
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:59,216
I have sprinkled water in the streets

703
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:04,873
so there is no dust
when he comes

704
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:07,832
Well done

705
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,958
Excuse me, Hajji, but
I hope this music is not profane

706
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,797
There's nothing wrong with it
actually it is very good

707
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,070
But a mosque is no place for singing!

708
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,949
Mr. Fazly, who says a mosque
is only a place for mourning?

709
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,998
Actually sometimes it's good
to cheer up and raise hell

710
00:51:34,033 --> 00:51:34,559
Well done

711
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,550
That really hit the spot after
the dinner we had, well done

712
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,551
One move Hajji!

713
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,637
God willing, in good time!

714
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,713
- Hajji, peace be upon you, Hajji
- Peace and God's blessing to you

715
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:05,795
- Do you want to go to the city, Hajji?
- With your permission

716
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,397
Do you want us to come
along so you don't get lost?

717
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,005
No need, I don't get lost

718
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,005
Excuse me, Hajji, I have a
question about virtuous acts

719
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,272
Listen, dear brother, I don't have
time to answer your question now

720
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:30,952
But it's like you two you're
sticking to me like bloodsuckers

721
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:31,638
and you follow me wherever I go

722
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,998
This is not...

723
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,392
- Virtuous!
- Virtuous!

724
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,676
Where are you going, Hajji?

725
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:44,245
To hell! God forbid!

726
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,829
God willing, I want to go
to the shrine for pilgrimage

727
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:52,789
I had a vision last night
and he asked for me

728
00:52:52,824 --> 00:52:52,824
How fortunate you are, Hajji

729
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,432
Please pray for us, Hajji

730
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,794
- He looks like a saint!
- Braveheart Shojayi!

731
00:53:04,829 --> 00:53:07,879
Please don't get up,
go on with your work

732
00:53:07,914 --> 00:53:10,313
What have you done, Reza?

733
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,352
At your service, Reza the Lizard
I missed you so much

734
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,590
Café Mozafari
Drug addicts not allowed

735
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,430
- What do you want?
- Hello

736
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,879
Who do you wanna see?

737
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,433
I wanna see Mahmoud Motazedi

738
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,078
What do you want?

739
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,393
I've come from Tehran, Jackson sent me

740
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:51,430
Are you Reza the Lizard?

741
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,829
With your permission!

742
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,748
Mahmoud was waitin' for you
at the train station, but you didn't show up

743
00:54:57,783 --> 00:54:58,885
The cops are here!

744
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,485
Get out! I said come out!

745
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,875
- What a pleasure Hajji!
- Peace be upon you, sir

746
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,319
What are you doing here?

747
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,592
Answering nature's call! But be
careful, there are no ewers here

748
00:55:23,627 --> 00:55:23,839
It was a pleasure to see you again

749
00:55:23,874 --> 00:55:24,599
Why don't you join us for prayers?

750
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,314
Pray for me!

751
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,965
I'm still thinking about
the paths that lead to God

752
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,434
Please continue, I'm sure
you'll find them if you keep thinking

753
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:51,285
Hajji, heads or tails?

754
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,869
Of course I don't know where
Mojtaba' gets these questions!

755
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:58,392
But anyhow, it's important
for Muslems to know...

756
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,669
how to conduct their
religious duties in space

757
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,205
I will tell you now, since
people are floating in space

758
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,556
if the body of a female astronaut

759
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:17,873
touches the body of a male astronaut

760
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:17,908
that would not be a problem

761
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,152
But it is necessary to join
them in temporary wedlock

762
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,685
before traveling to space
to be on the safe side

763
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,794
In such cases, due to the
shortage of water in spaceships

764
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:38,125
Ablution won't be needed

765
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,318
Excuse me, Hajji,
this is true for space,

766
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,839
but since there is gravity on earth

767
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:46,512
the relationship between
a girl and a boy is problematic

768
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,599
No, Mr. Fazly

769
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,949
Excuse me, but it seems to me that
you have had all your fun in your youth

770
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,831
and now that it is
these youngsters' turn

771
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:05,679
you are being more
Catholic than the Pope?

772
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,472
Don't we youngsters have hearts?

773
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:15,754
Okay, don't get carried away
and abuse what I say now

774
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:16,511
Let me finish

775
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,165
Yes, Mr. Fazly, at that time you
married a woman with 10000 tomans

776
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,954
but nowadays they don't even curse you

777
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:34,709
for that amount, let
alone give you a wife!

778
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:34,744
So what can the youth do?

779
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:42,310
Not all people have
the facilities to go to space

780
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,548
Mr. Fazly, I wanted
to say something to you

781
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:46,583
At your service, Hajji

782
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,597
Can I borrow your pickup for a
couple of hours? I want to go to the city

783
00:58:14,632 --> 00:58:15,405
The pickup is yours

784
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,079
We know the city quite well,
do you want us to come along?

785
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,319
Where do you want to go, Gholamali?

786
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,031
Have you memorized
the "Ankabout" verse?

787
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,805
Not all of it, but I will

788
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,910
You don't have much
time before enrollment

789
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,349
Go do your work,
if need be, I will take Hajji

790
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,755
Thank you, but it's a personal matter

791
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:35,919
- Personal?
- Yes

792
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,589
It's something
between me and God

793
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,991
Good for you Hajji,
don't forget to pray for us

794
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:45,026
Please

795
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,033
- How are you, Hajji?
- Thank you, what's up?

796
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,115
- Are you the sheriff?
- No, I just asked

797
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,473
Then leave, it's good to keep
your finger in your own pie

798
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,271
Well, well, Hajji, did he behave?

799
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,708
Yes, and how! Give me
the money, Hajji's alright

800
00:59:23,743 --> 00:59:24,950
I oughta tear him to pieces and...

801
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,514
What?

802
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,317
Nothing, I said peace
be upon you, Delangiz

803
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,511
If only Islam hadn't tied our hands

804
00:59:36,546 --> 00:59:36,546
Now you're talkin'

805
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,552
Why do you let those thugs
do whatever they like with you?

806
00:59:43,587 --> 00:59:44,033
What could I do?

807
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,482
My dear brother, under such

808
00:59:53,483 --> 00:59:55,685
circumstances it is necessary to...

809
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:00,157
- I mean to beat the hell out of them
- It's not s simple as you thinka

810
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:00,192
Hello

811
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,629
Hello, Mahmoud, it's me, Reza

812
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,788
I'm not Mahmoud,
where do you wanna go?

813
01:00:42,823 --> 01:00:43,751
Isn't this number 15?

814
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,429
Eighth Street, no. 15?

815
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,232
No, this is Ostovari street,
eighth Street is up ahead

816
01:00:51,267 --> 01:00:52,129
I'm sorry, but the last one was Seventh

817
01:00:52,164 --> 01:00:52,992
Yes, but the streets go in this order

818
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,757
Fifth, sixth, Ghaderi, seventh,

819
01:00:57,758 --> 01:01:00,914
Ostovari, Bolbol, ninth, eighth

820
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:01,069
- Who is it?
- It's Reza

821
01:01:01,104 --> 01:01:03,392
Reza? Come on in

822
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,398
Hello

823
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,838
You're not Reza

824
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,192
Is this Mr. Motazedi's
residence, no. 15?

825
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:28,799
No

826
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,550
Isn't this no. 15, Eighth Street?

827
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,319
This is it, but recently
municipality has changed the numbers

828
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:37,354
Yes?

829
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,836
Mr. Motazedi's residence?

830
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,433
Yes

831
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,205
God damn cowards

832
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,277
Don't get so worked up, mother

833
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:22,314
How can I not get worked up?

834
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:33,633
They handcuffed and took my
lovely son in front of my eyes

835
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:33,711
Do you expect me to dance?

836
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,909
Do you know where he is? Is he in jail?

837
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,555
If they don't let go of
my son, I will curse them

838
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:46,311
Listen, mother, Mahmoud
was keeping something for me

839
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:46,714
- Do you know where it is?
- No

840
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:02,659
He never brought his work

841
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:07,199
home because he was a bastard

842
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:06,565
He deserves whatever happens to him

843
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,398
- Thank you for your help
- Don't mention it

844
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,989
Visit me again, you
remind me of my bastard son

845
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,312
Sure

846
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,596
Hello, are you over there?

847
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,912
No, I'm still here!

848
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,197
Why didn't you go?

849
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,073
They have arrested
Motazedi, he's in jail

850
01:03:59,108 --> 01:04:01,878
Poor guy, what are you gonna do now?

851
01:04:01,913 --> 01:04:02,239
I don't know

852
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,870
Everything's such a mess

853
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,605
I gotta see if I can
do something myself

854
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,791
Don't you think of crossing
the border without a pass!

855
01:04:11,826 --> 01:04:14,154
You're dead meat if they catch you

856
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,965
No, God willing!

857
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,638
Why are you talking nonsense?

858
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,716
Good bye, God willing, goodbye

859
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,605
Hello, Hajji, how's your family?

860
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,153
We hope for the best,
I had a question, Hajji

861
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,125
This is what I do not call
a virtuous act, go ahead

862
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,765
Is the fear prayer required
after watching a horror movie?

863
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:45,352
Since you might piss in your pants
after watching a horror movie

864
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,831
ablution is in order for you

865
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,991
Go and wash up

866
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,831
Don't write, go wash

867
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,445
Hello, Motazedi?

868
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,516
That was great news, colonel

869
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,355
No offense hajji, but where were you
last night that your clothes smell so much?

870
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,632
Well, actually I had to
go on a mission last night

871
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,798
and as you know the streets
have lots of holes and puddles

872
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,311
So I fell in the gutter

873
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,553
Empty promises till when?

874
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,228
I swear our people
can't tolerate it any more

875
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,469
If they don't say anything,
it's because they are modest

876
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:10,511
I speak out because it's my responsibility

877
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:12,910
I am talking here, Mash Ali, my God!

878
01:06:12,945 --> 01:06:15,275
Today everyone is Mr. Shojayi's guest

879
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,318
Praise him for his
success in the election

880
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,600
What should a
parliament member have?

881
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,388
He has to have a cutting edge

882
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,838
The rest will take care of itself

883
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,750
You got foam in my eyes, oh God!

884
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,756
Who is he, Mr. Fazly?

885
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:46,153
He is engineer Shojayi

886
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,712
He wants to become a parliament
member, he's spending a lot of money

887
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,797
Who's that?

888
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,405
He wanted to cross the border illegally

889
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,115
the border patrols arrested
him and cut off both his hands

890
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,830
What happened, Hajji?
Did the steam get to you?

891
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,352
Go get two sodas, kid

892
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,518
You'll feel better in a minute, Hajji

893
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,074
We followed Hajji and he
went to bad neighborhoods!

894
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:19,354
In the name of God

895
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,829
I want to open an important
discussion with you loved ones

896
01:07:24,864 --> 01:07:26,488
and that is about the issue of cinema

897
01:07:26,523 --> 01:07:28,112
If brother Gholamali allows me...

898
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,313
please be quiet, I want to
have an important discussion

899
01:07:34,348 --> 01:07:35,433
Yes, Hajji

900
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,159
Yes, today we are going
to talk about Pulp Fiction

901
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:43,039
Mojtaba, do I have to call
your names one by one?

902
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,591
Be quiet!

903
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,112
Both you and Gholamali,
be quiet, we want to talk

904
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,154
Okay sir, okay

905
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,815
Yes, this move is made
by brother Tarantino

906
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,910
He is one of the great
Christian filmmakers

907
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,279
and I've heard he has won a few prizes

908
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,909
Mojtaba and Gholamali,
I asked you to be quiet

909
01:08:09,944 --> 01:08:11,075
Yes, Hajji, I just have one question

910
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,315
Stop whispering, you have already
asked all your questions, son

911
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,450
I won't continue the discussion

912
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:19,551
because I can't concentrate anymore

913
01:08:19,586 --> 01:08:19,586
- Yes!
- It's me Hajji

914
01:08:19,621 --> 01:08:20,751
How nice

915
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,157
Thank you God

916
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,515
Excuse me for bothering
you this late, Hajji

917
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,518
No problem, I'm at your service anytime

918
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:08,394
- Come in, dear
- Excuse me

919
01:09:08,429 --> 01:09:09,830
Come inside

920
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,038
Hello, Hajji

921
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,437
What's going on here?

922
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,911
We have come to help you

923
01:09:25,946 --> 01:09:27,233
To help me?

924
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,753
We know everything Hajji

925
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,470
Excuse me, what is it that you know?

926
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,780
Gholamali and I followed
you last night Hajji

927
01:09:38,815 --> 01:09:40,880
Excuse us but when
you said you had a vision

928
01:09:40,915 --> 01:09:41,677
We became curious

929
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,795
We were so moved, because

930
01:09:45,796 --> 01:09:49,430
of your greatness and your glory

931
01:09:46,925 --> 01:09:46,925
What?

932
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,236
Hajji, I promise your
secret will be safe with us

933
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:50,438
What secret?

934
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,556
That you go to poor
neighborhoods in disguise

935
01:09:59,591 --> 01:09:59,875
You visited the family of prisoners

936
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,085
She prayed for you a lot

937
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:08,045
You mean that old lady?
Of course, that's one of my duties

938
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,038
What duty Hajji? If it's a duty,
then why don't the others do it?

939
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,029
Oh, please

940
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,677
Helping one needy person
in secret is not that big of a deal

941
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:20,709
One!

942
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,805
That night he went
to at least twenty houses

943
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,753
Hajji's bag was full at the beginning
then it got empty at the end

944
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,485
I'm so upset... that you found out

945
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,796
Alms are rewarded
only when done in private

946
01:10:32,831 --> 01:10:34,674
At first we didn't want to mention it

947
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,231
but we thought it's not
right to look the other way

948
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,285
I just die for you charitable people

949
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,515
That's why we thought
we can accompany you tonight

950
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,669
This humanity and
kindness... what? Tonight?

951
01:10:51,704 --> 01:10:53,117
Yes, Hajji, tonight

952
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,592
But I'm not going anywhere tonight

953
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,993
Hajji, we know the
needy people of this town

954
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,832
That's right, but no!

955
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,765
We have even brought
our donations, go bring them

956
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,236
Hajji, we have never had a
true man of God here before

957
01:11:09,271 --> 01:11:10,365
We have never paid our religious debts

958
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,678
Take these and
distribute them as you wish

959
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,840
Look, Hajji, don't you want us
to take part in your good deed?

960
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,871
Okay, let's go and do

961
01:11:22,872 --> 01:11:24,387
some good deeds in private

962
01:11:24,422 --> 01:11:25,903
One, two, three, four...

963
01:11:25,938 --> 01:11:28,953
God bless you

964
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,471
We haven't done
anything, pray for Hajji

965
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,076
I'm in need for a prayer!

966
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,749
I was ashamed to face my children
we didn't have any food at home

967
01:11:57,784 --> 01:11:58,717
What do you do, my dear brother?

968
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,510
I am unemployed, Hajji

969
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,678
The factory went
bankrupt and I got laid off

970
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,525
Sit and eat

971
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,885
Your daughter seems to be sick

972
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,478
She's so hot, does she have a fever?

973
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,388
She's had a fever for three days

974
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,078
Why don't you take her to a doctor?

975
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,670
We took her, she has to have
some tests but it's too expensive

976
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:37,645
Better?!

977
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,194
Don't you wanna eat dinner?

978
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,832
Hajji, this is not right,
let me come back there

979
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,279
I have a few questions

980
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,998
No need, this is no time for questions

981
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,632
I want some fresh air

982
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,096
He asks so many questions

983
01:13:01,097 --> 01:13:03,082
that it has become a pain in the... neck

984
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:05,068
4500 is all that's left
from all that money

985
01:13:05,103 --> 01:13:05,103
God bless you, Hajji

986
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,430
You make people happy

987
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,876
You must be very happy, huh?

988
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,240
Yes, I'm happy, but I don't know why my

989
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:30,080
ears start ringing
when I do a good deed!

990
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:26,685
It's very strange

991
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,110
I envy you, God loves you a lot

992
01:13:30,145 --> 01:13:30,154
Please pray for me

993
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,925
You don't need my prayers

994
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,635
You are such a great
girl and true believer...

995
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,959
No Hajji, I haven't been a good person

996
01:13:42,994 --> 01:13:46,245
Have you sinned?

997
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,677
My dear, confess to me

998
01:13:50,678 --> 01:13:55,075
and unload the burden of your sins

999
01:13:51,645 --> 01:13:51,645
Damn these clothes!

1000
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,274
You can't make a move in them

1001
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,192
What was your question?

1002
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,915
Let's go, they are waiting

1003
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,797
Bring some tea, boy!

1004
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,716
What brings you this way,
Mr. Reza the lizard?

1005
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,277
I was just passing by,
I didn't think they'd release you

1006
01:14:32,312 --> 01:14:32,788
I haven't done anything

1007
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,552
Did they release Motazedi too?

1008
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,918
I don't know, it's been a long
time since I heard from him

1009
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,113
Any of you guys heard
anything about Motazedi?

1010
01:14:43,148 --> 01:14:44,773
They say he's been sent to prison

1011
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:46,398
There! Your tough luck, I guess!

1012
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,710
I wanted to tell you
something in private Lady Hajji

1013
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,925
Lady Hajji yourself! My name is Ozra

1014
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,794
Okay Ozra, do you know
anyone who smuggles people?

1015
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:56,313
For whom?

1016
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,589
For me

1017
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,756
Look at this, don't you love it?

1018
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,478
I take a 20000 Tomans check and
I change it into 200 thousand Tomans

1019
01:15:08,245 --> 01:15:08,245
Is this your own work?

1020
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,795
I'm in the traveler cheque business
I haven't done such things for a long time

1021
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,245
Well done

1022
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,158
- What about passports?
- You're Mahmoud's friend, right?

1023
01:15:19,193 --> 01:15:19,391
- You got a picture?
- Yeah

1024
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,669
Bring me 200 thousand
Tomans and take the passport

1025
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,633
200 thousand Tomans!

1026
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,792
Money doesn't grow on trees, you know

1027
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,470
That's the fee bro!
Even if Mahmoud were here

1028
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,798
he would've charged you the same,
you have to pay 50 thousand in advance

1029
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:37,085
That's not fair

1030
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,156
If you want to leave the
country, that's the only way

1031
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,389
Hello, Hajji

1032
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,313
Hello, strength to you,
what's all this for?

1033
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:45,515
Our saviour's birthday, Hajji!

1034
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,645
Great! We'll have a ball

1035
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,079
With your presence, of course, Hajji

1036
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,845
Excuse me, Hajji

1037
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,765
I have a question about ablution in space

1038
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,635
It is written that questions have
to be asked at the right time, not now

1039
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,365
It is written?

1040
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,394
It is written that questions have
to be asked at the right time, not now

1041
01:16:16,429 --> 01:16:18,237
I asked you to do one thing

1042
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,596
What could I do?
He just came all of a sudden

1043
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,712
Hajji

1044
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:33,038
- Hello
- Questions after prayers

1045
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,997
I don't have any questions

1046
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,358
I just wanted to say
we intend to get married!

1047
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,510
Congratulations, God willing

1048
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:49,913
But our parents don't know,
they are very strict

1049
01:16:47,005 --> 01:16:47,005
Don't worry, my lips are sealed

1050
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,237
Hajji, now I know how
you think about me

1051
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,073
I don't even think about you

1052
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,992
No Hajji, I won't make a good clergy

1053
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,954
- Why not?
- Because my heart isn't pure, Hajji

1054
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,832
Actually I'm just like you,
but I made good use of religion

1055
01:17:07,867 --> 01:17:09,358
Hajji, I'm not a true believer!

1056
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,285
When I say my prayers
my mind wanders off

1057
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,834
memorizing verses
are very difficult for me too

1058
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,115
But, damn me, when bad things
come my way, I get tempted

1059
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:20,509
I know what you mean

1060
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,197
Hajji, I shave my beard with a razor

1061
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,710
A student of theology doesn't

1062
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,365
Who says I have to become a clergyman?

1063
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,554
I have burnt my hand with a cigarette
to stop smoking, but I still smoke

1064
01:17:35,589 --> 01:17:35,877
No rational person
would do that to himself

1065
01:17:35,912 --> 01:17:36,556
Even God doesn't want
me to become a clergy

1066
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,829
You sap! Don't blame
God for your stupidity

1067
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,792
Look at me! You are a man and all
human beings are attracted to mischief

1068
01:17:46,827 --> 01:17:47,118
It's human nature

1069
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,951
God is not as strict as they say

1070
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:57,270
If he was totally against these things,
he wouldn't give us the tools for mischief

1071
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:57,565
Go live your life

1072
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,354
As the representative of God
in this area and all other areas

1073
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:06,671
I am telling you that
God has forgiven you

1074
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,679
Now go and have your fun

1075
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:12,158
But be careful!

1076
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:17,312
About the issue... of there being as many
paths leading to God as there are people

1077
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,273
Well?

1078
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,751
Hajji, I have lost my path

1079
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,513
Can you show me a shortcut?

1080
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,645
Oh, my God!
You're looking for a shortcut

1081
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,591
and I'm looking for a getaway
I need someone to help me...

1082
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,554
You good for nothing baldie!
May filth pours on your head!

1083
01:18:36,589 --> 01:18:37,477
What's going on here?

1084
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,115
Oh, God, Hajji,
he's killing my only daughter!

1085
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:42,150
But why?

1086
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,874
He says if she doesn't go
back to him, he'll kill her

1087
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:48,511
I hope you haven't called the police

1088
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,717
No, he says he'll kill
her if the police comes

1089
01:18:53,752 --> 01:18:53,752
Then let's go and get him!

1090
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,197
He says he'll kill her if anyone goes up

1091
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,396
Over my dead body!

1092
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,478
Why doesn't she go back to her life?
Who better than Delangiz?!

1093
01:19:02,513 --> 01:19:03,445
Shut up! Over my dead body!

1094
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,313
Open the door, brother Delangiz!

1095
01:19:06,348 --> 01:19:07,995
Open the door

1096
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,028
- Why doesn't this open?
- Sorry, it's locked

1097
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,229
Where's the key?

1098
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,594
My boss has it, you can
go up and get it from him

1099
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,472
Up?

1100
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,645
Okay

1101
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:31,232
I have no other choice,
with the landlord's permission

1102
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:31,267
You have no right! Eh! Hajji!

1103
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:32,989
What are you doing here?

1104
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,955
I have come to talk to you

1105
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,879
I have nothing to say to you

1106
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,993
Get out from where you came
before I break your bones

1107
01:20:15,028 --> 01:20:15,590
- Damn you!
- Shut up!

1108
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,551
Let my dear one leave
and I will stay here to guide you

1109
01:20:20,205 --> 01:20:20,205
I got no use for you, Mullah!

1110
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:25,268
You better not insult the
clergy or put a price on them!

1111
01:20:25,303 --> 01:20:25,303
What'll happen if I do?

1112
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,511
Move aside or you'll get it!

1113
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,829
Wait a second

1114
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,669
Looks like you don't understand!

1115
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,445
Wait a second, dear Delangiz

1116
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,755
I want to give you a piece of advise

1117
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:53,874
Wait! I'm talking!

1118
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,994
Don't ever try to hit a man of the cloth

1119
01:20:58,995 --> 01:21:02,709
specially if he is from downtown Tehran!

1120
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:02,744
Oh, my God! He's killing Hajji

1121
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:03,897
As I told you before,

1122
01:21:03,898 --> 01:21:05,764
the paths leading to God are?

1123
01:21:05,799 --> 01:21:07,630
As many as there are people!

1124
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,473
Well done, now you can add
three other paths to that list

1125
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,395
hitting with the palm of your
hand, kicking below the knee

1126
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,155
and a blow with the head you can use them
in cases of emergency, they're sure to work!

1127
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:25,592
Well, goodbye dear one

1128
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:26,995
Now go clean up your boss!

1129
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,874
Thank you, Hajji,
that made me feel better

1130
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,151
My boss's pride!

1131
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,993
God damn your boss

1132
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,792
As they say, Lieutenant
Nemati is our mole in narcotics

1133
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,599
Tell him, Nemati

1134
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,456
Yes, I was sitting in Mozafari teahouse

1135
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:04,353
on detail, and the man you said came in

1136
01:22:02,525 --> 01:22:02,525
Did you see his face?

1137
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,792
I wasn't facing him, but the
teahouse owner called him the Lizard

1138
01:22:06,827 --> 01:22:06,827
Did you hear that with your own ears?

1139
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,405
Yes, I'm sure, they were whispering

1140
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,149
they were talking about
passports, then they left together

1141
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,229
Of course, the teahouse owner's husband
used to smuggle people across the border

1142
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:22,264
But he died four years ago

1143
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,948
Now the teahouse has
become a hangout for criminals

1144
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,675
We haven't shut the place down
to be able to arrest all of them

1145
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,596
You mean the woman might
be in the same business?

1146
01:22:33,631 --> 01:22:34,709
Or she might know the smugglers

1147
01:22:34,744 --> 01:22:35,788
- Hello, Hajji
- Peace be upon you

1148
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,631
Excuse me, Hajji, but is prayers
accepted with these wounds?

1149
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,237
It's got nothing to do with that,
you have to have a pure soul

1150
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,028
- A lot of people came to the mosque
- We are going to the mosque too

1151
01:22:56,063 --> 01:22:58,629
- I have another question, Hajji
- Ask me after the prayers

1152
01:22:58,664 --> 01:22:59,634
He don't look like he can beat anyone

1153
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,189
Not at all

1154
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,313
Ain't it a little embarassin', boss?

1155
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,029
Why?

1156
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,989
They might say we've come to the
mosque because we're afraid of the Mullah

1157
01:23:20,024 --> 01:23:20,325
Let 'em say what they want

1158
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,397
This is one Mullah that Delangiz
is willing to stand behind for prayers

1159
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:23,432
Praise for all of Muslem clergymen!

1160
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,355
Please sit down, please, please

1161
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:29,125
In the name of God The Merciful

1162
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,539
I am glad to see that a lot of

1163
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,918
the locals have gathered here

1164
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,734
I think it's the effect of that famous

1165
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:49,789
sentence the paths to reach God

1166
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:51,119
Because I can see two brothers
who were worthless thugs

1167
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,915
have joined Islam as well, thank God

1168
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,839
I hope they have felt this
from the bottom of their hearts

1169
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:10,592
Actually I am only recently beginning
to understand the depth of this sentence

1170
01:24:10,627 --> 01:24:12,476
Instead of sitting up there and preaching

1171
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,436
I should sit here and really
think about this sentence

1172
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:18,990
God's peace and mercy
and benevolence be upon you

1173
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:25,876
Father, you weren't there to see
how the guy, who had 6 children, felt!

1174
01:24:25,911 --> 01:24:25,911
Tell him, Hajji

1175
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,405
Yes, actually I was really moved

1176
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,874
Of course I'm sure
you're doing good deeds, Hajji

1177
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,274
But you, when you left
and came back in the morning

1178
01:24:39,309 --> 01:24:41,068
do you know how far behind
you got in your main duty?

1179
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,798
Which one is my main duty?
Helping people or memorizing the "Koran"?

1180
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,788
Don't shout slogans, kid!

1181
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,591
You are not here to serve people

1182
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,635
Get up, get up

1183
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,525
I'm talking to you, Gholamali

1184
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,615
- I won't enter the competition
- What?

1185
01:24:57,650 --> 01:24:59,670
I won't take part in the competition

1186
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,398
I am not able to memorize

1187
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,271
You say something, Hajji

1188
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,085
Mr. Fazly, don't pick on the youth so much

1189
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,873
You can't force people
into heaven, dear brother!

1190
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,958
You are pushing so hard that they
might fall off the other side into hell

1191
01:25:12,993 --> 01:25:14,349
- Hajji!
- What?

1192
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,398
- Everyone's waiting
- What are these?

1193
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,392
Bread and dates,
my mom prepared them

1194
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,199
All my cousins have come

1195
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,071
Two pickups are waiting
at the front door, please come

1196
01:25:27,106 --> 01:25:29,354
I'm not coming with you tonight

1197
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:30,309
- Why Hajji?
- Because...

1198
01:25:30,344 --> 01:25:31,229
But that's not possible, Hajji

1199
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,725
Dear brother, I have a mission

1200
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,070
Please give this money
to the needy on my behalf

1201
01:25:38,105 --> 01:25:38,836
It's obvious that the guy is very needy!

1202
01:25:38,871 --> 01:25:39,309
I have a question about need

1203
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,358
This is no time for questions

1204
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,755
Those are God's
mysterious ways, now leave

1205
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:48,565
You go on too

1206
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,953
I have to leave myself

1207
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,555
Do you like it?

1208
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,478
Not bad!

1209
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,753
Not bad?!

1210
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,913
You're so out of it!

1211
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,758
Do you know I went through
hell to change this number?

1212
01:26:07,793 --> 01:26:07,834
Thanks a lot

1213
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,794
But this corner still needs some work

1214
01:26:10,829 --> 01:26:11,592
Your work is very delicate!

1215
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,205
They call me Ozra Shapoury!

1216
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,595
Master Yousef Shapoury's daughter!

1217
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,915
Really? How interesting!

1218
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,325
Do you even know him?

1219
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,429
No, but when you say the name...

1220
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,045
Everyone in this region
knows Yousef Shapoury

1221
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,550
He was a master miniature artist
I was also his student

1222
01:26:27,245 --> 01:26:27,585
Then why did you turn up like this?

1223
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:30,619
Destiny, poor thing thought

1224
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,958
I'll become a famous painter one day

1225
01:26:33,894 --> 01:26:34,765
What delusions!

1226
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,637
What do you want?

1227
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,398
Here you go

1228
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,589
- What the hell's this?
- You tell her what this is

1229
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:51,759
This means there are as many paths
leading to God as there are people

1230
01:26:51,794 --> 01:26:51,794
Oh go on, dude!

1231
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,685
Don't forget, goodbye, let's go

1232
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,188
Don't people have better things to do?

1233
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,395
He has brought these and says
there are a lot of paths leading to God

1234
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:05,430
That's ridiculous!

1235
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,634
- Have some bread and dates
- Thanks, I've Iready had somea

1236
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,677
- What was the number?
- 20

1237
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,645
What happened, Ozra?

1238
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,831
Tonight, after so many years
I got reminded of my parents

1239
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,512
Then all of a sudden they ring the
bell and bring me bread and dates!

1240
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,631
So what?

1241
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,592
God hasn't forgotten me

1242
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,076
Well, that's cool!
Now let's get on with our work

1243
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,358
Repentance!

1244
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,796
Ozra? Forget about it, what repentance?

1245
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:04,471
I have repented, I've returned

1246
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,073
I know those guys
they don't have anything better to do!

1247
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,992
Come and fix the passport so
I can get on with my miserable life

1248
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,834
Passport?

1249
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,205
What are you doing, nutcase? Eh!

1250
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:20,677
You better repent too,
God will forgive you

1251
01:28:19,405 --> 01:28:19,405
Crazy lady!

1252
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,273
Hey, what's with you?
God bless the cows!

1253
01:28:22,308 --> 01:28:24,278
- Mrs. Shapoury?
- No!

1254
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,991
Aren't you Mrs. Shapoury?

1255
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,557
I said no!

1256
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,638
Isn't this number 20?

1257
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,517
Who are you to ask questions?

1258
01:28:42,552 --> 01:28:43,272
Yes

1259
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,070
Isn't this no. 20, Shirojan Street?

1260
01:28:47,105 --> 01:28:47,105
No, officer

1261
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,274
This is no. 2, you've made a mistake

1262
01:28:53,309 --> 01:28:54,152
Is this no. 2?

1263
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:00,551
Eh! What happened to our number?

1264
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:01,029
The pigeons have done this

1265
01:29:01,064 --> 01:29:02,111
There you go, now it's 2

1266
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,477
God help me, what

1267
01:29:05,478 --> 01:29:08,634
have I done to myself? God!

1268
01:29:08,669 --> 01:29:10,152
You have to repent too

1269
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,151
God will forgive you too

1270
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,512
There's room for all of you

1271
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,235
Ozra?

1272
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:31,356
Ozra isn't here anymore,

1273
01:29:31,285 --> 01:29:31,285
The 50 thousand I paid her!

1274
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,595
The woman has found time to repent!

1275
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,552
Get back, move aside

1276
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:59,708
Repent, repent and
God will forgive you

1277
01:29:59,743 --> 01:29:59,743
See the posters we have printed?

1278
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,753
Engineer Shojayi with
ready to punch out deceit

1279
01:30:09,788 --> 01:30:09,788
This one shows that engineer Shojayi

1280
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,525
is a thoughtful man,
who thinks about the future

1281
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,759
Engineer Shojayi standing in front
of the people with ultimate power

1282
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,525
Sir, I love this one

1283
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,836
Shojayi has turned his back to all the

1284
01:30:58,837 --> 01:31:01,517
money in the world and he doesn't care!

1285
01:31:01,552 --> 01:31:02,148
Thank you, they are
great, have them printed

1286
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,712
Sir, with these posters, God willing,
you're as good as elected

1287
01:31:06,747 --> 01:31:07,752
Your breakfast is ready, sir

1288
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,750
The fresh bread got here at last

1289
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,269
Follow the printing process
I want them posted by tomorrow

1290
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,165
Yes sir, don't worry

1291
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,952
Why are you so late, Safoura?

1292
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,959
I've been waiting for
fresh bread for an hour

1293
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,479
Forgive me, something had happened

1294
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,435
I hope it's nothing bad

1295
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,685
My aunt is a bit of a con!

1296
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,435
She repented last night
and the neighborhood is in chaos

1297
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:36,151
How did she repent that it
caused a chaos in a neighborhood?

1298
01:31:36,186 --> 01:31:37,072
They say, Hajji Reza has spoken to her

1299
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,313
I didn't understand what she was saying
she just kept crying all the time

1300
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,799
Who's Hajji Reza?

1301
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,045
Haven't you heard?
The sheikh of Amir Mosque

1302
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,640
Every night he goes to the house
of the needy and gives them money

1303
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,605
And you know how
he does it? In disguise!

1304
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,358
If he goes in disguise
how do you know it's him?

1305
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,445
He uses a disguise,
but now everyone knows him

1306
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,233
He gives money to the poor and dowry
to the girls who want to get married

1307
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,238
He cures the sick...

1308
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,794
He cures the sick!

1309
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,353
They say a dumb boy
has eaten the beard

1310
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:09,873
and dates that Hajji Reza
gave him and now he can talk

1311
01:32:09,405 --> 01:32:09,405
I see!

1312
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,396
Peace to you, Hajji!

1313
01:32:11,431 --> 01:32:12,797
Peace to you!

1314
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,957
Hajji, are you on another mission?

1315
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,389
Yes, private mission,
with your permission

1316
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:35,991
- Good for you, Hajji
- Hello Hajji!

1317
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:39,353
Hajji! You brought
light to our humble hut

1318
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,078
God knows how much
I wanted to see you

1319
01:32:42,113 --> 01:32:44,396
Now that I've found you, I won't let go

1320
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,594
Thank you, but I've
already told our friends...

1321
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,510
No, Hajji, I'm the host
and you are the guest

1322
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,271
And as they say,
a guest is the host's what?

1323
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,669
The host's dog?

1324
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,798
Don't say that, you are our
master the apple of our eyes

1325
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:01,998
Do you know why I wanted to see you?

1326
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,913
Because I'm a charity
worker just like you, sir

1327
01:33:04,948 --> 01:33:04,948
- I see!
- I do good deeds

1328
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,838
I build mosques and schools

1329
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,155
God bless you

1330
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,445
I'll come and visit
you tomorrow for lunch

1331
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,675
Hold on, hold on, Hajji,
I want to take you somewhere

1332
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:15,309
I'm sure it's going to make you happy

1333
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:16,309
- Where?
- Prison

1334
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,879
No, we're coming,
we'll be there in ten minutes

1335
01:33:21,914 --> 01:33:22,725
Goodbye

1336
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,749
Excuse me...

1337
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,354
Hajji, we have the good
fortune on our saviour's birthday

1338
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,195
to pay the debts of a few prisoners
who were arrested for bounced cheques

1339
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:29,725
and have them released

1340
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,045
It's a private gathering
and I want you to come

1341
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,365
Well, it would be an honor
for me, but I can't come today

1342
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:38,076
Listen, Hajji, I have a bad temper and if
anyone disagrees with me, I will get upset

1343
01:33:38,111 --> 01:33:38,111
Safoura, can't you
get us two cups of tea?

1344
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:39,078
She keeps answering back

1345
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,316
Releasing prisoners is one
of the most important affairs

1346
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,485
Please, go ahead

1347
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,274
Safdary, 150 thousand Tomans,

1348
01:33:51,275 --> 01:33:53,169
Vakili, 150 thousand Tomans

1349
01:33:53,204 --> 01:33:55,064
Maghareyi, 150 thousand Tomans

1350
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,589
This poor thing is here
for 50 thousand Tomans?!

1351
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,914
He's a good kid too,
God will really reward you

1352
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,358
Yes, Saneyi, 500 thousand Tomans...

1353
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,958
No, this was not on the list

1354
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,592
Here, look

1355
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,549
Eh! I thought it's 50 thousand Tomans!

1356
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,993
Forget it, any man who owes 500
thousand Tomans belongs in prison

1357
01:34:26,028 --> 01:34:26,918
How much is the total?

1358
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,915
A million 430 thousand Tomans

1359
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,958
Don't we have anyone with
70 thousand Tomans to make it even?

1360
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,030
No, there's one who owes
100 thousand Tomans

1361
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,031
No, that's enough!

1362
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,597
Hello

1363
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,405
Mr. Mojaver is one of my colleagues

1364
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,874
God willing, engineer Shojayi
is going to be our representative

1365
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,589
Hajji Ahmadi, one of our
greatest charity workers

1366
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,232
My pleasure, Hajji

1367
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,433
The pleasure is mine

1368
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,515
What happened, major?

1369
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,685
You mean Ozra?
She doesn't have any information

1370
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:07,429
She seems to have gone crazy,
she keeps talking about repentance

1371
01:35:07,464 --> 01:35:07,749
Let's go for the ceremony together Hajji

1372
01:35:07,784 --> 01:35:07,953
Please

1373
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,520
In the name of God The Merciful

1374
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,595
Greetings to all you respectable folks

1375
01:35:18,596 --> 01:35:23,391
and especially to my dear inmate friends

1376
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:25,408
Of course we all know that

1377
01:35:25,409 --> 01:35:27,391
people... sometimes break the law

1378
01:35:27,426 --> 01:35:27,426
because of need and misery

1379
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:42,429
and they say that
outlaws are not believers

1380
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,796
Well, what does that mean?

1381
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,876
Allow me to explain

1382
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,897
First of all... don't think

1383
01:36:02,898 --> 01:36:06,555
that God has forgotten you

1384
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:11,805
The prison gates might be closed to you

1385
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,156
but... the gates to God's

1386
01:36:15,157 --> 01:36:18,473
blessing are always open to you

1387
01:36:18,508 --> 01:36:18,589
Stop thinking of ways to escape!

1388
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:28,245
God doesn't only
belong to good people!

1389
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:33,434
Our God, is the God
of the criminals as well

1390
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:40,672
And it is only God, who doesn't
look upon people differently

1391
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:56,118
the heaviest dude in friendship

1392
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,925
A good friend, will give
everything for his buddy

1393
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,428
If people live by the codes

1394
01:37:04,429 --> 01:37:06,896
they will never steal anything

1395
01:37:06,931 --> 01:37:11,832
But unfortunately, some people
want everything for themselves

1396
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:15,000
and this is very bad

1397
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:24,312
We have to do
something to tame people

1398
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,645
Taming means...
creating love

1399
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:35,365
and that's the only way
leading to God, this is very important

1400
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:39,717
I don't aim to preach
because it's useless

1401
01:37:39,718 --> 01:37:44,035
and no one can be forced into...

1402
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:45,352
that's why mankind should...

1403
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:56,325
Allow me to finish
my words with a poem

1404
01:37:56,360 --> 01:38:01,297
Man is worthy of honor

1405
01:38:01,298 --> 01:38:06,235
for his soul and humanity

1406
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:10,550
Beautiful attire do not reflect his worth

1407
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:16,439
I hope that all of you be
released from here very soon

1408
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,674
and that you can find your path

1409
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:33,996
Please pray for me to find a path as well

1410
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:39,190
I hope I don't see you here
and you don't see me here

1411
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,174
and we see each other in other places

1412
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:46,549
May God be with you and bless you

1413
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,311
Thank you for your time

1414
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,599
Forgive me for
talking so much

1415
01:38:55,634 --> 01:38:58,799
But this is very cruel Mr. Mojaver

1416
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,882
Prisoners don't come here to have fun,

1417
01:39:02,883 --> 01:39:03,845
they come here to get reformed

1418
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:07,714
As they say, the schoolmaster's punishment
is better than the father's kindness

1419
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,238
Don't you agree, Hajji?

1420
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:18,477
Yes, you are right, I agree with you

1421
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,072
Didn't you have a T.V.
Program a few years ago

1422
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,895
called Knowledge in television, Hajji?

1423
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:31,165
Well done, Knowledge in television

1424
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,839
Didn't I tell you? I've seen you on T.V.

1425
01:39:33,874 --> 01:39:34,149
How nice that you remember

1426
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,675
Mahmoud Motazedi to the visiting room

1427
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,672
It was a fruitful program

1428
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,245
It was on Monday nights, right Hajji?

1429
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:49,955
Yes, you're right, Monday nights, excuse
me but I have an excremental problem

1430
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,877
and I have to find some water, excuse me

1431
01:39:51,912 --> 01:39:52,198
- Mr. Motazedi?
- Yes?

1432
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:56,389
I wanted to talk to
you for a few minutes

1433
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,358
Are they gonna execute me?

1434
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:09,115
No, it will only take a few minutes

1435
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:10,159
Please, Hajji

1436
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,638
I'm Reza Mesghali

1437
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,310
Reza Mesghali? I don't know you

1438
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:19,470
Reza the lizard

1439
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,639
Who sent you?

1440
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,035
Jackson

1441
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,431
You were supposed to
smuggle me across the border

1442
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,445
Don't disgrace me

1443
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,476
Cool, what a nice disguise!

1444
01:40:34,511 --> 01:40:36,473
I'm in deep shit, Mahmoud

1445
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,079
Why didn't you leave?

1446
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,394
I tried to see you, but they
said they've arrested you

1447
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,755
Why didn't you get your passport?

1448
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,485
- Passport? From who?
- From my mother...

1449
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,875
Your pass was ready
when you gave us your picture

1450
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,365
Don't lie, I went to her

1451
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,152
Did you tell her who you are?

1452
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,433
No

1453
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,039
Well, how could she know it's you?

1454
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,878
Go tell her who you are,
get your pass and leave

1455
01:41:02,913 --> 01:41:03,879
You ain't puttin' me on?

1456
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:05,605
Why should I? I owe Jackson a lot

1457
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:09,349
Well, goodbye,
you may take him now, brother

1458
01:41:09,384 --> 01:41:09,959
Please pray for me, Hajji

1459
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,436
It was a great program and
we had a nice time Mr. Moshaver

1460
01:41:13,471 --> 01:41:13,471
I'm Mojaver, Hajji

1461
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,354
I hope to find another chance to...

1462
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,114
I hope to see you on T.V. Again

1463
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:25,472
Of course they insist a lot but because
their programs are of such low quality

1464
01:41:25,507 --> 01:41:25,507
I don't accept, goodbye

1465
01:41:25,542 --> 01:41:25,836
Goodbye, Hajji

1466
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,271
What are you so suspicious about?

1467
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,837
There was never a T. V program
called Knowledge in television

1468
01:41:33,872 --> 01:41:35,355
How could I know it was you?

1469
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,239
You looked like undercover cops

1470
01:41:37,274 --> 01:41:38,999
Did you say it was a passport?

1471
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,954
Yes

1472
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:47,039
I believe in right and wrong
and I don't swipe the customer's money

1473
01:41:47,074 --> 01:41:47,669
That's how I've raised my bastard son!

1474
01:41:47,704 --> 01:41:48,837
Here...

1475
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,275
You look better with a beard

1476
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,645
Yes, thank you

1477
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,557
I'm mourning for my father

1478
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:01,195
No problem, but the
border is closed now

1479
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:06,314
Come back in two or three hours

1480
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,350
Okay, I'll wait for another
two or three hours

1481
01:42:16,385 --> 01:42:16,714
I'll come back

1482
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,832
You went on a mission in broad daylight?

1483
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,271
Missions don't have any special time

1484
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,269
Finish your work, we'll
start the evening prayers early

1485
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,475
Is that possible, Hajji?

1486
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:40,515
In cases of emergency it is allowed

1487
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:42,191
Well, Gholamali, what's up?

1488
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,438
I want to enter the competition

1489
01:42:44,473 --> 01:42:45,552
Well done

1490
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,793
After you, Hajji

1491
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,285
May God accept

1492
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,005
Hello Hajji, what are you doing here?

1493
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:57,717
Hello, Faezeh, my dear one, may
God kill me, what are you carrying?

1494
01:42:57,205 --> 01:42:57,205
It must be very heavy

1495
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,196
It's greens for tonight's celebration

1496
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,638
Allow me to help you

1497
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,119
No, I swear to God, I won't let you

1498
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,445
I have come here to serve you

1499
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,994
By the way, isn't your
mother coming to the mosque?

1500
01:43:12,029 --> 01:43:12,309
She sends her regards

1501
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,910
She went to the upper
village to wash the fruit

1502
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,559
Oh! So she's not here?

1503
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:23,839
Although I don't have much time,
but allow me to guide you to your home

1504
01:43:23,874 --> 01:43:23,874
Then you have to come up
and have tea with me

1505
01:43:23,909 --> 01:43:23,909
Come up?

1506
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:27,393
Damn this temptation

1507
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,398
I would love to, but...

1508
01:43:32,433 --> 01:43:35,595
- Delangiz?
- Yes, Hajji?

1509
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:38,758
Come, help carry Faezeh's load

1510
01:43:38,793 --> 01:43:38,953
I am at her service

1511
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,469
I don't need your help

1512
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:46,313
This Delangiz is not the old Delangiz!

1513
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,565
God willing, he's become much better

1514
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,070
It's been a while that he
regrets how he treated you

1515
01:43:53,105 --> 01:43:53,105
He has done that before, he's lying

1516
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,192
No, I swear to God,
it's different this time

1517
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,791
Nonsense, you can't fool me any more

1518
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:02,313
- I won't do anything to her
- I said carry these stuff and don't talk

1519
01:44:02,348 --> 01:44:05,355
He keeps explaining himself,
he talks like a chatterbox

1520
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:05,390
I said take these and shut up

1521
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,112
Yes Hajji

1522
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,073
Thank you Hajji, goodbye

1523
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:15,476
From police headquarters to the station

1524
01:44:15,477 --> 01:44:16,716
this is to inform you
that Hajji Reza Ahmadi

1525
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:17,605
who was recruited to be...
the prayer leader of Amir mosque

1526
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:21,952
passed away due to severe illness
before he could go on his mission

1527
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:45,553
You mean this Hajji Ahmadi
is the armed robber?

1528
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,799
Reza the lizard

1529
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,318
He wasn't armed

1530
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,638
We arrested his accomplice last week

1531
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,257
and he confessed that
the weapon belonged to him

1532
01:45:09,292 --> 01:45:11,235
But this man has done
so many good things here

1533
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,799
People swear on his name

1534
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,877
Well, they are making a mistake

1535
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:17,639
Let's go

1536
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,633
Hajji, he's going to sing,
aren't you coming?

1537
01:45:21,668 --> 01:45:21,668
Tell him to start

1538
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,478
Yes, Hajji

1539
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,718
These clothes are
supposed to tame people

1540
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,234
It's good for people
to become tamed, isn't it?

1541
01:46:27,269 --> 01:46:28,430
No need for that anymore

1542
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:43,349
There is no one in this world
who doesn't have a path to reach God

1543
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,355
You have to have a pure soul

1544
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:19,113
You can't force people
into heaven, dear brother!

1545
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,908
You will push so
hard that they

1546
01:48:23,909 --> 01:48:26,617
might fall off the other side into hell

1547
01:48:26,652 --> 01:48:32,035
God is the heaviest dude in gentleness,
the heaviest dude in kindness

1548
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,957
the heaviest dude in forgiveness,
and the heaviest dude in friendship
