1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, damn.

2
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,292
You'll find Captain Kraft up there.

3
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,000
- Thank you, soldier.
- Get down.

4
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,708
Shh, shh, be quiet.

5
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,958
Is this trench 17-A 154?

6
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,125
Yes.

7
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,792
Lieutenant Von Przygodski,
reporting for duty, sir.

8
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,292
Go put the soup on, Schultz.

9
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,875
Would you like to come down here?

10
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,417
Is it absolutely necessary?

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,667
The... It is custom.

12
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,792
Yes. Follow me, would you?

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,708
Welcome to the front, Lieutenant.

14
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,292
Yes, very smart, I'm sure.

15
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,875
New boots.

16
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,208
What do you expect to find here,
Lieutenant?

17
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,542
Fame and glory, of course.
I'm a Prussian.

18
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,083
Military background.
My father was a colonel.

19
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,917
- Heroism is my destiny.
- Is it?

20
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,958
Is it'? Very good.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,292
Ugh, God, you ought to be shot, Schultz.

22
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,022
If you want heroism you should
try some of Schultz's soup.

23
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,042
Follow me.

24
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,917
You can almost smell the enemy's breath,

25
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,500
- can't you, Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,792
War is one of the most fascinating aspects

27
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,333
of human nature.
Did you know that?

28
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,000
Listen. The men, sir.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,958
They seem to be cheering.

30
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,917
Enthusiasm.
It's enthusiasm for battle.

31
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,792
Captain Kraft!
The war is over, Captain!

32
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:46,208
Do you still want fame
and honor, Lieutenant?

33
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,083
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,833
But it's an Allied trick.

35
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,647
They'll do anything
to distract us from our cause.

36
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,917
The war will never be over
while we are losing.

37
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,833
This is a trap!

38
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,833
Attack! Attack! Attack!

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,625
War is over!

40
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,333
It's over.

41
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,583
He's awake!

42
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,708
Excuse me but where am I exactly?

43
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm... I'm awfully sorry...

44
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,083
My regiment.

45
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,292
I need to rejoin my regiment.

46
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:50,667
Where?

47
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,083
But we found this helmet in your hands.

48
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,375
We thought you were one of us.

49
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:24,208
Lying to us, eating our bread,
drinking our milk!

50
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,333
Sleeping in our beds!
With our pillows!

51
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,583
Our hero.

52
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,125
Looking at our girls!

53
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,292
Excuse me.

54
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,500
I have a problem,
I have to get back to Berlin.

55
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:16,292
If you want to go to Berlin,
that train is the best bet.

56
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,042
It was not like this before.

57
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,583
Not here, demonstrations, surely?

58
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,583
Demonstration after demonstration.

59
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:52,292
All of you, stop whatever you are doing

60
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,750
before it's too late!

61
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,333
Hmm, but Berlin
will always be Berlin. No?

62
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,250
And we shall look the other way.

63
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,958
- Pretend it isn't happening.
- Yeah.

Don't, it's the only thing I brought back.

72
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,375
- God's sake!
- Come back!

73
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,958
Leave me alone!
Find your own pigs!

74
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,125
How do you expect to win a revolution

75
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,333
if all you're interest in is food?

76
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,500
Leave me alone, find your own pigs.

77
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,417
[{dogs bark] Relax!

78
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,875
Good morning!

79
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,042
<i>Mufti?</i>

80
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,417
Mother?

81
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,458
Uh... ex... excuse me?

82
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,292
Excuse me'?

83
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,208
<i>Mufti?</i>

84
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,000
- Hello?
- Sorry,

85
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,333
all the rooms are taken.

86
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,125
But I think we could find
some space for your pig.

87
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,500
- Aunt Hilda!
- Paul.

88
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,458
Paul... oh, my God.

89
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,458
Oh, Paul, what happened?

90
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,208
- Yeah...
- We thought you were dead.

91
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,958
No, I'm not dead.
I'm very much alive.

92
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah. But... but... but...

93
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,042
How long have you been alive?

94
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:55,667
Ever since I can remember.
Look, what is going on here?

95
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,313
Paul is back. Paul is back.
What a mess! What a mess!

96
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,792
Yes, it was a mess, explosions usually are.

97
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,417
Your mother is going to faint
if she sees you.

98
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,750
<i>Where 'vs Mutti?</i>

99
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,833
She can explain it better than I can!

100
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:12,583
She, um... she is at the...
at the Turkish bath.

101
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,667
What on earth is she doing there?

102
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,542
An activity she took up
at the end of the war.

103
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,333
It's called working.

104
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,583
Working?

105
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,042
- My mother is working?
- Yes, <i>Mutti</i> is working.

106
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,792
Paul“ -Aunt Hilda.

107
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,583
Aunt Hilda, I want those people

108
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,583
out of my room before I get back.

109
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,208
But... but Paul!

110
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,958
Bravery!

111
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,792
And fill it up for me, please.

112
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,917
Okay.

113
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,500
Oh, yes, he was, he was.

114
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,542
They wanted to award him the Iron Cross

115
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,333
but I told them not to bother,

116
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,625
to keep their medals for the war efforts.

117
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,375
Oh, here she goes again.

118
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,333
I personally prefer Paris in May.

119
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:30,542
Oh, my God!

120
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,208
The hallucinations are coming.

121
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,958
What hallucinations?

122
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,292
Of my poor Paul.

123
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,292
I often see his face
in front of me with this...

124
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,875
sensitive, bewildered, calm expression.

125
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,333
<i>Mutti?</i>

126
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,083
He always used to have...

127
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,750
Paul! Paul!

128
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,625
The War Department lied to me.

129
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:11,083
- The War Department?
- Yes, they said you were dead

130
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,708
and I had to believe somebody.

131
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,000
You've been gone
for quite some time, you know.

132
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,042
Well, and awful lot's happened to me,

133
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,542
hospitals, that kind of thing.

134
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,333
Oh, my God!

135
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,292
You've been dead
for so many months and now...

136
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,000
My God, you could have chosen
a better way to resurrect.

137
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,833
Some men have no heart, dead or alive.

138
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,750
- I've brought a pig home.
- A pig.

139
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,375
It's just a family quarrel,

140
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,875
it's so boring!

141
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,250
- Come on now, let's go.
- Oh, my boy,

142
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,855
if your father hears
that all you brought back

143
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,000
from the war is a pig,
he'll have another stroke

144
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,958
- of paralysis.
- Another what?

145
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,083
How long has he been like this?

146
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,500
Since the end of the war,

147
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,542
since the proclamation of the Republic.

148
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,333
The blow was too much for him.

149
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,333
He chose that particular chair,
he refused to let go of it

150
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,583
and only after we changed it
into a wheelchair,

151
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,500
he started to cooperate.

152
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,667
It's a shame he won't recognize you.

153
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,417
Vati!

154
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:15,083
- No, no, no, no.
- It is worth a try.

155
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,833
Vati! You see,

156
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,478
I actually think he's just pretending,

157
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,292
he won't admit defeat. You know.

158
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,458
Father, we may have been defeated

159
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,833
but we haven't lost the war.

160
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,333
Sold-out politicians
stabbed us in the back.

161
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,917
<i>Attack! Attack! Attack!</i>

162
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,500
Paul! Paul!

163
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,125
Oh! Cilly.

164
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,875
To what do we owe this unexpected visit

165
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,708
of our house-keeper socialist daughter?

166
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,833
Is this Paul's breakfast?

167
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:02,750
Yes, of course it is.

168
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,833
<i>
'

</i> take it to him.

169
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,292
No, I'll take it for him.

170
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,535
- Cilly, please let it be...
- No, no, no, I can do it.

171
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:15,083
She didn't even say hello.
These lower classes.

172
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,375
The charm.

173
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,667
So, you're back.
After three years.

174
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,417
How sweet.
Why have they turned this place

175
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,542
into some kind of sordid guest house?

176
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,250
I'm very happy to see that
you're the same senseless idiot

177
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,973
that you were before you went to the war.

178
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,792
The war wasn't quite what I expected.

179
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,625
This is no sordid guesthouse.
This is Pension Przygodski.

180
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,042
Like Kempinski. "Przygodski."
You say it in the same breath.

181
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,417
By the way, did you know that
I'm one of the working class's

182
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,750
most popular artists?

183
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,958
Well, I know you sing in the streets.

184
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,208
Well, we can't all be war heroes.

185
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,208
You should join us, you could
play the military parts.

186
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,583
Oh, don't be childish, I'm an officer.

187
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,958
Silly me to forget.

188
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,583
Paul! Oh, excuse me.

189
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,375
Paul, please come on.
Let's try if it fits.

190
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,792
Times may have changed,

191
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,417
but appearances still count for so much.

192
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,625
This really isn't bad, you know.

193
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,730
I always thought that Uncle Heinrich

194
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,125
was very much taller than me.

195
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,500
He shrank when they made him a captain.

196
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,000
I think the responsibility
was too much for him.

197
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,042
Yes, yes I know.
I have to patch up

198
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,542
the bullet hole.

199
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,125
Shh.

200
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,875
- Morning.
- Morning.

201
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,583
Who is that?

202
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,750
We don't know,

203
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,625
but we think he has something
to do with tax.

204
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,375
How do you feel, Paul?

205
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,042
- Does it fit?
- Oh, it looks beautiful...

206
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,250
just like the old Paul I've dreamed of.

207
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,500
Take those down to the table.

208
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,292
Are you all right, my boy?

209
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,500
He's trying very hard, isn't he?

210
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,708
Yes, but I really don't think
it's the best job

211
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,792
for an officer.

212
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,167
We've got to find something better.

213
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,958
Paul, your mother's very worried about you.

214
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,458
Did she ask you to tell me that?

215
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,333
Oh, no.
I'm worried about you too.

216
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't seem to be able to adapt

217
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,583
as easily as everybody else.

218
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,417
Let me say that you don't seem
to be settling in here

219
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,333
as easily as we'd hoped.

220
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,833
No, I don't, do I?

221
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,458
If it's a sacrifice
for my mother to work here

222
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,875
it's an impossibility for me.

223
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,625
All right.

224
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,708
Perhaps a military situation
would be more suitable.

225
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,833
- I have a friend who has a...
- Oh, please, Major.

226
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,792
You've done quite enough
for our family as it is.

227
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,333
I'm capable

228
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,750
of finding my own employment.

229
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,833
Number one, are you all right?

230
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,292
You ready, number two?

231
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,500
All right, hurry up!

232
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,625
- Oh, you are the sixth bottle?
- Yes.

233
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,208
Come here.

234
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,708
- The employment officer...
- I know who sent you,

235
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,125
- save your breath. Name?
- Przygodski.

236
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,625
Przygodski. Come on! Help him.

237
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,083
This is your bottle.

238
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,047
Keep it clean and tidy.
Bring it back on Friday.

239
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,333
No bottle, no wages.
Get in there.

240
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:37,833
Line up.

241
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,708
All bottles, line up!

242
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,708
- This isn't...
- Hey! Get in.

243
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,625
- Come on, quickly...
- Ow!

244
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,792
Uh. Hello? Help.

245
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,917
Um. I can't breathe very...

246
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,833
It's going-

247
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,208
All bottles, line up.
Hey, come on.

248
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,292
Stop pretending you're
champagne. Alexanderplatz.

249
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,083
Put them left side.
Put them right side.

250
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,708
Hurry up! Come on!

251
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,375
Hey, there, sixth bottle!
What's the problem?

252
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,708
Line up there.
Come on, that way.

253
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:23,792
Go on.

254
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,375
Morning, Paul.

255
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,458
Oh, good morning, Major.
How did you know it was me?

256
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,167
I'm a major, Lieutenant.

257
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,500
You didn't think I could fail
to recognize the contents

258
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,917
of any bottle at 50 paces, eh?

259
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,125
Isn't this a little undignified?

260
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,208
Well, certainly inconvenient.

261
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:08,125
Then I really think
you ought to consider my...

262
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:09,917
I heard there was a painter...

263
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,917
Good morning, Major.

264
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,167
I'm sure he's involved

265
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,292
in the black market in some way.

266
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,542
I heard there was a painter.

267
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,167
Yes, that's it.

268
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,125
Actually, he's involved in...

269
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:31,000
Paul, tell me, how's your new job?

270
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,583
It's all right.
Bit confining, I suppose.

271
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,583
Come. Do make yourself useful.

272
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,542
Here are some flowers which came for Eva.

273
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,292
Take them and put them in her room.

274
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,917
But in a vase.

275
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,375
Gitta, down.

276
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,833
Please stop it. Gitta.

277
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,750
What are you doing on my bed?

278
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,042
I can explain. My aunt...

279
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,208
The old lady with the curly hair.

280
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:33,667
Uh. These arrived
and she wanted me to...

281
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,917
These flowers.

282
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,397
Would you please put them over there?

283
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,417
Yes, of course.

284
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,375
I am sorry.

285
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,667
I am very sorry.

286
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,083
Is that your bottle blocking the entrance?

287
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,917
Yes, it's my bottle.

288
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,750
- Would you move it away, please?
- Yes, of course.

289
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,917
Uh. I am sorry.

290
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:07,208
Gitta, come on. Gitta,
Gitta, here. Gitta, come.

291
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,542
Come. Have some food.

292
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:28,500
<i>♪ I wonder why you
Keep me waiting I</i>

293
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:34,458

294
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:43,542

300
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,208
I have nice legs.
Don't you think?

301
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,458
- Cilly?
- In person!

302
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:32,583
Imagine you're now at the front,
blood, horror, explosion,

303
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,542
and a little soldier's whore
comes to warm you up.

304
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,542
You take her slowly
as you would sip a cup of tea.

305
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:45,958
- A cup of tea?
- Well, coffee then.

306
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,500
When I was a little girl
I imagined that you would come

307
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,542
and take me like some great crusader.

308
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,292
You'd ride back on a white horse,

309
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:03,500
and then you'd make love to me
on the floor... or in a boat...

310
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,833
or in the middle of the city
on the Victory Monument.

311
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,375
There was no victory.

312
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,625
Aren't you sentimental?

313
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,500
Didn't they teach you how to kill?

314
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,250
No, not really.

315
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,917
And you're behaving like an actress.

316
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:22,917
Like some sex-starved,
irresponsible, immoral slut!

317
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:25,708
Well, I certainly hope so.

318
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,208
But it's not getting me any place, is it?

319
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:35,250
Just imagine we're in Venice, on a gondola.

320
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,625
Somebody's serenading us while
we're going down the canals.

321
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,792
What are you looking at?

322
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,792
Stars.

323
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:54,548
I've forgotten
how beautiful they are in truth.

324
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,875
That's not the only thing you've forgotten.

325
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,333
Yes, the stars are twinkling in the sky.

326
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,042
And you, my little warrior,
are suffering from shell shock.

327
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,542
Well, I tried.

328
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,375
But just keep looking up there.

329
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:28,292
Someday you may see
another beautiful German star.

330
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
Me.

331
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,542
Night.

332
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,750
Hello again, my dear.

333
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,333
Are your services available this evening?

334
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,792
Be in your room then.

335
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,875
- Oh.
- Shall we say in ten minutes?

336
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,792
Paul, would you be so kind

337
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,667
and help me with these packages, please?

338
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,375
Sorry, hope I am
not bothering you too much.

339
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,417
Thank you very much.

340
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:57,667
Come on.

341
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,917
Gitta, come on.

342
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,417
Over there. Thank you.

343
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,167
Paul. Won't you stay
for a moment?

344
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:14,833
I'm really rather busy. Sorry.

345
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:15,917
Please.

346
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,833
Sit down.

347
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:20,917
Very well.

348
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,792
- A little tea perhaps?
- Yes.

349
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,375
Gitta, please. Stop.

350
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:33,083
If they're such a nuisance,
why don't you get rid of them?

351
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,833
Oh, no.
I couldn't possibly do that.

352
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,042
Gifts from old lovers must always be kept.

353
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,375
No matter how cumbersome.

354
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,917
Sometimes I think the larger the gift,

355
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,542
the more ineffective the lover.

356
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:59,625
What's the matter?

357
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,917
And why are you looking at me that way?

358
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:07,167
I saw you last night.
Picking up men.

359
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:13,083
Can I explain something?
I too had hopes, ambitions,

360
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:18,042
I thought I knew who I was...
who I'm going to be.

361
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,292
As you see.

362
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,333
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Ashamed?

363
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:32,083
I think shame belongs to another decade.

364
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,542
There's no such thing.

365
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,625
You shouldn't be ashamed
of your bottle either.

366
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:41,292
It's a wonderful hiding place
until you find yourself.

367
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,458
- [Flaughs]
- f laughs]

368
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:47,167
See. You can laugh.

369
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:51,333
You should do that more often.
Becomes you.

370
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,125
Do you think it'll ever be the same again?

371
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:03,583
No.

372
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,292
Come on, come on, move it.

373
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:36,125
Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster.

374
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,083
Excuse me? Uh. Von MUller.

375
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:53,292
Oh, I know who sent you here.
The boss is up there.

376
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,583
Um, excuse me'?
Major Von Mijller sent me.

377
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,708
Yes. Come here, would you?

378
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:18,875
Captain.

379
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,708
- Do I know you?
- Przygodski, sir.

380
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:29,792
{Hermanrfl F> r2.

381
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,750
But you were in the war, weren't you?

382
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,042
- Yes, sir!
- Saint Mihiel?

383
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,480
- Yes, sir!
- You were with explosion.

384
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,667
Yes, that's right, sir.

385
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,750
- Are you still alive?
- Of course I am, sir.

386
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:43,583
And ready for duty.

387
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,083
Well it's very good to have you back.

388
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,792
Very good to be back, sir.

389
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,417
- We didn't lose the war, did we?
- No, sir.

390
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,808
We're going to win the peace, aren't we?

391
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Sir!

392
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,417
- A lot of things to accomplish.
- We have, sir.

393
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,333
Do you realize that the future
of Germany lies in these hands?

394
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:10,958
Yes, sir.

395
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,375
Yes, sir.

396
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,375
You may have the chance
to share my balcony.

397
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,750
- Follow me.
- Sir.

398
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:27,667
I will show you such things, my boy,

399
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:30,333
as will change the entire
philosophy of your life.

400
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,917
We have the chance to realize
the dreams and ambitions

401
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,292
of our forefathers and to rid our society

402
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,750
of the garbage and grime of our times.

403
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,083
That war should be banished from the world.

404
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,167
It's not only absurd,
it involves the atrophy

405
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,167
of some of the finest and the essential...

406
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,000
essential things of mankind.

407
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Captain Kraft, my hand.
It hurts.

408
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,125
Yes, but it hurts me too
when I think of our fatherland

409
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,208
overrun by vermin.

410
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,583
Quick.
Come on. Door. Door, help me.

411
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,708
We have a great opportunity, by the way.

412
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,000
We're going to set those Reds
in their place. From here.

413
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:14,583
From our underground headquarters.

414
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,875
It's gonna be into the trench,

415
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,542
over the hill, and into the battle.

416
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,625
Well, what do you think of it?
It's wonderful, isn't it?

417
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,583
Nietzsche.

418
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:31,833
Look, you see?

419
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,083
Goethe.

420
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,083
- You've read all these?
- I have no time to read.

421
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,792
Read? I have other
people to do that for me.

422
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,083
Taking notes. The books
are just there for inspiration.

423
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,458
Do you like music?

424
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,292
Listen to this. Listen.

425
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:56,417
Mm_.

426
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,667
- Do you recognize it'? Hm?
- Um...

427
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,042
<i>It's Wagner.
Ring des Nibelungen.</i>

428
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,375
I can see it now.

429
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,417
Masses of blond-haired, blue-eyed subjects

430
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,292
with our name on their lips
and our beliefs in their hearts

431
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,542
waiting for us...

432
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,042
to give them that great idea.

433
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,292
The idea that will transform
the human race.

434
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,750
- Hmm.
- What idea?

435
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:26,750
I don't know yet.
People are working on it.

436
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,583
But we must let nothing stand in our way.

437
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,458
- Especially women.
- Women?

438
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,208
Do you realize that a passionate woman

439
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,625
can destroy the greatest warrior?

440
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,480
Do you remember
what Josephine did to Napoleon?

441
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,792
- What?
- She...

442
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,167
What does it matter?
We're rewriting history.

443
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,292
From here, we shall spread the tentacles

444
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,917
of our organization through
every street in this city.

445
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Through every city in this country,

446
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,667
and through every country in the world.

447
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,792
Door.

448
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,875
Propaganda.

449
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,125
You can stay here if you want.

450
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:12,417
Thank you very much.

451
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:38,042
- You swine.
- I beg your pardon?

452
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:45,000
Because of your rosy cheeks,
I know you think

453
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,625
you are pretty enough.

454
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,583
YOU!

455
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:52,625
You've ruined it. Uh.

456
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:55,792
And if you wish to address me
you'll do so correctly.

457
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,875
My name is Lieutenant Paul
Ambrosius von Przygodski.

458
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,125
Do you think you can jump into our bed,

459
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:08,333
Ambrosius? I show you! You! You!

460
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,542
Otto.

461
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,542
Otto.

462
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:21,625
- I... I...
- He's broken my nose.

463
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,583
No. No.

464
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:38,000
Paul, would you leave us please?
Outside, if you wouldn't mind.

465
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,125
Who's... a naughty... boy then?

466
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:49,042
Hermann, forgive me, please.

467
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,500
I didn't mean to.
Hermann, please!

468
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,772
- No! No! No!
- Don't you know

469
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:56,583
- I can't stand violence?
- No, no, no, no.

470
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,333
You know I can't stand violence.

471
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:12,917
Sorry about...

472
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,667
Otto, his nerves are...
his nerves are shattered.

473
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,263
It's the pressures of terrorism, you know.

474
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:35,625
He'll be staying with us...

475
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,250
for a while.
Until he's himself again.

476
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:48,125
The things he said, they are...
they are foolish.

477
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,667
You mustn't take any notice of him.

478
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,090
Mustn't let anything stand
in our way, must we?

479
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,875
Especially trivialities.

480
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,292
Yes.

481
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:11,542
I hear Paul is progressing
really quite well.

482
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,417
It seems the young man has found

483
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,083
just the right niche for himself.

484
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:25,208
You kill the goose...
and I'll make the stuffing.

485
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,458
- No, no, no, no.
- Why?

486
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,542
You kill the goose
and I'll make the stuffing.

487
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,875
No, no, no, no, no,
you kill the goose and I...

488
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,730
- I want to make stuffing.
- Will make the stuffing.

489
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,292
Please, keep it.

490
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:44,625
Please... oh, you're hopeless.

491
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,750
I'll do it.

492
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:48,958
Uh.

493
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,292
Oh, go away, go away, away, give it.

494
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,625
Oh, no!

495
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:58,958
Oh, no, poor thing.

496
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,292
Wait, wait, wait, I'll go.

497
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,292
Oh, Oh.

498
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,625
Merry Christmas, <i>Mutti.</i>

499
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,000
Mother, this is Captain Kraft.

500
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:13,958
- Hi.
- How do you do?

501
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,480
- Aunt Hilda, Captain Kraft.
- Nice to meet you.

502
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
How do you do?

503
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,750
I'm so glad you could come,
I... I had the feeling

504
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,625
Paul was trying to hide you from us.

505
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,375
I'm so glad he feels fine
in his new position.

506
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,083
Paul is one in a million, aren't you?

507
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,750
Yes, he is.

508
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,833
You must excuse us, but we were
just trying to slaughter a...

509
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,292
Oh! No...

510
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,583
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

511
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:42,730
- Can I?
- Yes! Would you please?

512
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,125
It will be so kind of you.

513
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,542
Hmm.

514
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,417
I... may not eat meat but I do
know something about animals.

515
00:41:58,792 --> 00:41:59,875
All right. Come here.

516
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,292
Oh, no.

517
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:18,333
She said yes, I said no, and then I made...

518
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:22,042
Excuse me, I'd just like to say
that the colonel's contribution

519
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,042
to the war will not be forgotten.

520
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,417
- Hear, hear. Well said.
- Beautifully said, thank you.

521
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,875
Nor will the contribution
of the esteemed Ms. Eva.

522
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,625
I thought I donated to help
celebrate Paul's new life.

523
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,708
- Yes!
- I'll drink to that.

524
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:38,833
To Paul.

525
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:40,958
They tell me you don't eat meat?

526
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,375
Not a bite.

527
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,042
That reminds me of an old comrade of mine

528
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,292
from Minsk.
He had the same problem.

529
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,083
Do you abstain for religious reasons

530
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,833
or are you just a mistake by nature?

531
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,125
The only religious abstentions
I have are to religion.

532
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,875
Oh, that sounds
like a line out of Vaudeville.

533
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:03,083
You know what I gave up
for lent? Religion.

534
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,708
No, no, I take it back.

535
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,292
Lacks taste.

536
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,500
God died in this country, my dear.

537
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,917
Oh, Oh, really?
That must've been some funeral.

538
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,667
Cilly, please,
this is not one of your shows.

539
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,958
Shows? But you invited
all these clowns here tonight,

540
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,958
I thought this was everybody's show.

541
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,250
Isn't it?

542
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,208
Cilly. —Lt's all right, Paul.

543
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,083
We, who are in command,
have to suffer greater hazards

544
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:33,083
than the idle conversations of women.

545
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,292
Do you think you know a great
deal about women, Captain?

546
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,208
- Excuse me.
- Hermann...

547
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,833
I hope you'll excuse me.

548
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,833
Oh, Captain Kraft, please.

549
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,333
Come back sometime,
you're always welcome here.

550
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,208
Yes, I know where you are.

551
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,708
I'll see you later, Paul.

552
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,667
Paul, I'm sorry.

553
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,375
- I'm sorry.
- Please excuse me, Mother.

554
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,292
Paul!

555
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:35,792
Paul!

556
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:40,292
Paul.

557
00:44:40,917 --> 00:44:41,917
Paul!

558
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:44,397
- You cannot just...
- Please, Cilly, not now,

559
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:47,042
this is none of your concern,
this is none of your business.

560
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,208
Come back here.

561
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,208
You've been gone for months now,

562
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,933
at least you can tell me where you live.

563
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,333
No, I can't, it's military secret.

564
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,792
Well, what about us?

565
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:04,208
Cilly, there comes a time
in every man's life...

566
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:07,750
when he has to avoid making
the same mistakes as Napoleon.

567
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,750
Paul, you're slipping off
of the deep edge again.

568
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,750
Not at all, it's...

569
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,167
it's just that I'm coming very close

570
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,625
to my life long purpose.

571
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:18,667
What purpose?

572
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,958
Well, I'm not sure yet,
but people are taking notice.

573
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:27,083
I know Hermann isn't quite
as clear as he ought to be,

574
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,333
but at least he hasn't given up
like everybody else.

575
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,000
And I need something positive, Cilly.

576
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,375
Shell shock, it's gotta be shell shock.

577
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:49,458
Hermann?

578
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Hermann?

579
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,667
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

580
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,830
I shouldn't... I shouldn't have
done that, I'm sorry.

581
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,833
Don't leave me, Paul.

582
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:26,208
It is a sad state of affairs,

583
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,000
- when standards drops so low.
- Yeah, you're right.

584
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,792
- Where are we going?
- Hmm. I know.

585
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,958
What is going to
become of us, I don't know.

586
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,667
And the young people, where are they going?

587
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:45,167
<i>Mutti.</i>

588
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:51,875
<i>Mufti.</i>

589
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:06,583
Where have you been so long?

590
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,542
I'm not sure.

591
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,708
And... how are you?

592
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:21,542
As usual.

593
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,583
You can't keep running, you know.

594
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,083
Yes.

595
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:32,500
It's just that...

596
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:36,667
something is missing.

597
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,792
Everything I've been told...

598
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,250
my background...

599
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:48,375
all of it...

600
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,083
it's so meaningless.

601
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,167
Where is Cilly?

602
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,083

Thanks.

Why not?

624
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:21,042
I don't know, seems to be
bothering me recently.

625
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,042
Anyway, aren't you gonna ask me
how I've been.

626
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,625
I don't have to, I could just
tell by looking at you.

627
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
How have I been?

628
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,625
Suffering, complacent.

629
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:38,250
Like a suicidal wildebeest.

630
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:42,250
Oh, but you can be happy now,
because now you can say that

631
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,708
you knew me way back then.

632
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:46,833
Way back when?

633
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:51,167
Way back before I was famous.

634
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,792
What happened to politics?

635
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,187
They used to call me the child prodigy

636
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,333
of the revolution,

637
00:49:57,542 --> 00:50:00,875
but the revolution was a little
slow in coming so, I moved on.

638
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,125
Yes that seems to be my problem.

639
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:10,375
You got a lot of problems.

640
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,750
How's your shell shock?

641
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,708

she's only in love with her work,

Well, did you like it?

685
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,208
It wasn't quite what I expected.

686
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:12,208
I... I wasn't really trained
for that kind of thing.

687
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,958
You're so much adaptable than me.

688
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:30,958
There doesn't seem to be any measure now.

689

Day by day, moment of...

691
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,875
Everyone's kind of floating.
Hmm?

692
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:46,833
Soafing.

693
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,917
Through the sky
with the freedom of the birds

694
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,167
who've just learned how to use their wings.

695
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,958
God, you're dramatic.

696
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:01,000
Don't you feel it?

697
00:55:02,292 --> 00:55:03,292
I feel useless.

698
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,167
There's nobody here but us.

699
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:25,750
Look! It's got everything.

700
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:28,000
It's got seventy rooms.

701
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,458
Dogs, cats, horses, silverware, servants.

702
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,375
- And a prince.
- A what?

703
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh, a prince.

704
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,458
He comes with the house
but he won't bother us.

705
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:41,833
He told me that he'd give it
to me as soon as I was ready.

706
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,208
We can put the bed here.

707
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,042
What are you doing?

708
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,417
I'm taking off my clothes.

709
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:52,980
It's easier to make love that way.

710
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,583
Cilly, please.

711
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,167
I have waited for the past three years.

712
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,417
I don't intend to wait any longer.

713
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,042
Haven't you got any sense of decency?

714
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:03,792
This is somebody's home.

715
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:08,583
- Don't you love me?
- That's not the point.

716
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,292
I don't think we should play around

717
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:12,792
until the Kaiser returns.

718
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,625
You gotta be kidding.

719
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,708
No it's just that...

720
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:22,708
Germany today is no place
to raise a family.

721
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,292
Well, who's talking about a family?

722
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:25,833
I just wanna make love.

723
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:28,417
Why do you have to complicate things?

724
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:32,202
Why is it the only thing
that women think about is sex.

725
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,500
I mean, what happened to...

726
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,042
What happened to families,
and children and parents?

727
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:38,583
Oh, they died. It was in
all the papers last week,

728
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:39,708
didn't you read it?

729
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,333
I don't have much time.

730
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,792
It's a little warm in here, isn't it?

731
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:06,750
Let's go upstairs.

732
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,208
Good morning. Good morning.

733
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,042
- Slept well?
- Very.

734
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,208
- Water warm enough?
- Just right, yes.

735
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:46,208
Mm-hmm.

736
00:57:57,208 --> 00:58:00,625
Thank you, thank you.
Are you the, um...

737
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,583
The prince.

738
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,292
- Yes.
- Yes.

739
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,417
It's a wonderful place you've got here.

740
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,417
Yes, we like it.

741
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:11,792
- Have you been prince for long?
- A

, my life.

742
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:15,833
- Any kings in the family?
- Five.

743
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:16,958
Oh, really?

744
00:58:17,417 --> 00:58:20,583
Two of them were murdered
by their brothers.

745
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:25,250
- Any particular reason?
- Not really.

746
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:29,417
They were just found making love
to their mistresses.

747
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:39,792
Max.

748
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:43,042
Oh, Cilly. I'm sorry
to come so early.

749
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:48,625
You should be. Do you have
any idea what time it is?

750
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,625
Okay, come on up.

751
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:54,875
Agents have no respect
for personal relationships, God.

752
00:58:55,917 --> 00:59:00,458
Cilly, aren't you going
to catch cold like that?

753
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:05,333
- What do you want, Max?
- Cilly, I have a job for you.

754
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,625
One that could fill
this whole house with dollars.

755
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:10,667
Does it look like it needs it?

756
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,667
No... but you do. I do.

757
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:18,667
There've been some Americans
at the club last night.

758
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:22,208
They did find you sensational.
They want to see you right away.

759
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:25,167
- But I mean, now!
- But I can't!

760
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:28,458
But they are thinking
of taking you to Hollywood.

761
00:59:29,542 --> 00:59:30,542
Hollywood?

762
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,708
I think I'm clean now.

763
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:36,500
If you could pass me a towel.
I'll be on my way.

764
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:38,250
Yes, of course.

765
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,167
Thanks.

766
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,458
I've known Cilly for a very long time.

767
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:49,875
Since, uh...

768
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:53,250
But you're not anymore that...

769
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:00,250
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?

770
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,625
- Good evening.
- Hello.

771
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,833
This is the third evening
you've been in here.

772
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:57,125
She has left my dear, it's too late.

773
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,000
I really can't understand

774
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,833
why she'd leave without telling anybody.

775
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,625
She didn't give a shit about you.

776
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:22,625
I have the impression my dear friend.

777
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:23,792
That we've met before.

778
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:28,833
Lieutenant Von Lipzig,
the Academy. Class of '17.

779
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:31,250
- Von Lipzig?
- Mm-hmm.

780
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,333
I'm stationed at Eden Bar.

781
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,083
Baroness von Semering's regiment.

782
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:37,917
Who?

783
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,833
It's actually quite pleasant, you know.

784
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:40,917
The money is excellent

785
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,708
and the dress is more than suitable.

786
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:47,292
You look as if you're free tonight.

787
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,333
How perspicacious.

788
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:51,083
Yeah.

789
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,542
I wonder if you'd do an ex-alumni a favor.

790
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,917
You see my lady companion
turned up with a friend.

791
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,208
And I'm somewhat annoyed tonight.

792
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:01,667
I haven't got enough blood
for both of them.

793
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,833
Perhaps, you can join us at the Eden.

794
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,458
Excuse me. The Baroness
would like to see you.

795
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:28,375
If you'll excuse me.

796
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:46,167
Come in.

797
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,125
You dance quite well.

798
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,250
Champagne?

799
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,792
Dom Pérignon, my favorite.

800
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,583
Dancing, music...

801
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:08,583
champagne.

802
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:12,458
The best way to forget...

803
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,458
until you find something
you want to remember.

804
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,333
Have you got a military education?

805
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,750
Yes, my father was Colonel Von Przygodski.

806
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,750
Any other credentials?

807
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:34,292
Languages?

808
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:39,583
There's one thing I don't like...

809
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,000
poor fantasy in speech.

810
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,083
It lacks charm.

811
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,500
And you don't seem to lack anything.

812
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,500
How's your French?

813
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:56,333
Oh, I've spent a great deal of time

814
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:57,750
in one of their hospitals.

815
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,167
Why all the questions?

816
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:05,333
Let's call it an interview.

817
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,167
A recruitment if you like.

818
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,583
Isn't that a term the military use.

819
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:16,792
Yes, I suppose so.

820
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,167
I'm the head of a regiment of sorts.

821
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:23,958
The gigolos.

822
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,458
Yes, the lieutenant told me.

823
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,042
All you need is a battlefield.

824
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:31,792
Right there.

825
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,333
It's for you.

826
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,458
Frau Aeckerle will be very happy.

827
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:10,750
And surely other people will be too.

828
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:16,625
You may leave now.

829
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,083
Thank you.

830
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:46,583
Would you...

831
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:52,833
Would you care to dance?

832
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,750
Oh.

833
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:10,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

834
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,917
Frau Przygodski, how are you?

835
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,958
Oh, yes, you like our hats?

836
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,208
Frau Von Kaiserling.

837
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:22,125
I'm sorry dear friends I cannot stay.

838
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:23,875
You see I've had a slight mishap.

839
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:27,583
My husband, the general,
he died of stroke this morning.

840
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:30,625
But Helga that's terrible.

841
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,208
But he was so healthy.

842
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:36,625
Yes, I know and all his life
he wanted to die with a bullet.

843
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:40,167
But then we can't always have
what we want, can we?

844
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:45,250
My condolences. I propose
we have a moment of silence

845
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,708
to commemorate the departure of a man

846
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:50,792
who was a fine, fine soldier.

847
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:55,167
We're going to have
a moment of silence, Gustav,

848
01:07:55,292 --> 01:07:56,958
for Helga's dead husband.

849
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh my God. What was that?

850
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,167
It's my son.

851
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:14,458
He's almost a man.

852
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,583
<i>Mutti,</i> sounds awfully close,

853
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:45,750
I think...

854
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,288
I think you should go back.

855
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:49,917
And leave you alone? Never.

856
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,750
Left wing idiots.
Fighting everywhere.

857
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:55,250
They don't even respect the dead.

858
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:01,208
Move faster. Move faster.

859
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:06,042
Oh my God. Oh my God.

860
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:10,000
- Just a few more yards.
- Faster, God. Faster. Faster.

861
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:13,417
Faster. Faster.

862
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:14,730
They're shooting, they're shooting!

863
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,292
Oh, they're shooting.

864
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,750
Over here. Come on hide.

865
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,125
Push him out of the way. Hide.

866
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,417
Gentlemen, advance to the left.

867
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:40,333
- Mutti, go back, quickly.
- Only if you come with me.

868
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,708
Please, you come with me.

869
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:43,875
This is a military funeral and somebody

870
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,855
- has to look after the widow.
- Yes, I need a willing officer.

871
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,083
Paul, please. Paul!

872
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:49,772
- —Don't worry, <i>Mutti.</i>
- It's so wonderful...

873
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:50,708
- I'll take you...
- to find a...

874
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:51,833
safely to the grave.

875
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:56,125
Look out! Look out!

876
01:09:56,417 --> 01:09:58,917
Just help him out.
Behind the cover. Hide.

877
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,625
Yes, sir, I'll do that right away, sir.

878
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,708
Come back, come back, please!
Come back, come back!

879
01:10:10,667 --> 01:10:11,750
It is a coffin.

880
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:16,542
Come on! Just a few more yards.

881
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,333
Thank you, lieutenant.

882
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:45,717
I don't know what I would've
done without you.

883
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,583
Yes, did you see that?

884
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,458
Yes, he finally got his bullet.

885
01:10:51,792 --> 01:10:53,625
How unfortunate that he should die

886
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,958
when he had someone like you.

887
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,875
Fatherland was his pride.

888
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:04,958
Yes.

889
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:07,958
Must've been a great honor.

890
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,250
Don't be afraid, I'm still here.

891
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:29,125
Bravo, Kaiserling, you are very brave...

892
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:30,583
Call me Helga, Paul.

893
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,292
I should be so alone.

894
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,833
Of course you won't.

895
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:41,417
- Will you help me, Paul?
- Of course.

896
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:43,333
Of course.

897
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:46,542
Of course.

898
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,125
Do anything I Say?

899
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:52,833
Um. Of course.

900
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,042
Of course.

901
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,625
Of course.

902
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,792
- Do anything I say?
- Of course.

903
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:10,917
Charge lieutenant.
Charge! Mount. Mount.

904
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:13,917
Charge lieutenant. Charge!

905
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:20,458
Mount! Attack! Attack! Attack!

906
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,667
Victory.

907
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,167
It's wonderful.

908
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:13,875
Yes.

909
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:16,167
It's absolutely wonderful.

910
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:18,917
I feel like a puppet.

911
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,417
Is it not enough that I'm staying with you?

912
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:24,083
Do I have to be subjected
to this embarrassment as well?

913
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:27,833
Just relax, Paul.
Try walking. Just walk.

914
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:32,792
Yes, not so stiff in the shoulders, hmm.

915
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:34,958
Just lose. Yes.

916
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,792
Now try a little bit a of tilt
to your head. Just a touch.

917
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,083
That's better. It's marvelous.

918
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,625
Now, try putting your hand on your stomach

919
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:48,917
as if you had a gastric ulcer,
and smile. Like this.

920
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,833
How do I smile
with a gastric ulcer. Look...

921
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:55,375
Do, let's stop this.
I feel uncomfortable.

922
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,250
Don't be ridiculous.

923
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:58,875
Now, how can I present you in public?

924
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,313
You have to have the right image.

925
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:01,500
You have to be elegant.

926
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:03,833
I don't want to be presented in public.

927
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:06,583
Just relax, dear.
I'll play a little music,

928
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:07,917
stay just like you are.

929
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,083

I've always dreamed
of doing a tango in this house.

932
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:23,250
Just feel the music, Paul.

Come dance with me, Paul.

942
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,583
Come share it with me.

943
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:03,750
Come, Paul.

944
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,625
Come here, lieutenant.

945
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:27,397
Don't you think it's a bit late

946
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:29,167
for giving orders Frau Von Kaiserling.

947
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,708
Could've learned together.

948
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,083
I don't think so.

949
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,667
You're making a fool of yourself.

950
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:40,625
I see.

951
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:44,708
Very well then.

952
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:47,708
Look at me when I talk to you.

953
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:51,917
Now get out, lieutenant.

954
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:54,458
Thank you.

955
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:12,000
You know what he is now?

956
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:13,792
A gigolo my dear.

957
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:16,375
My God. Imagine that.

958
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:19,875
- That is true.
- Told you...

959
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,417
no good would come of him.

960
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,917
- Yes?
- Frau Von Kaiserling?

961
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,625
Come in.

962
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,250
Thank you.

963
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:39,708
- My name is Captain Kraft.
- Please.

964
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,833
Um. I'm here looking
for a comrade of mine.

965
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:54,000
I understand he's being staying
with you for a while.

966
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:56,417
I'm afraid you're a bit late, captain.

967
01:16:57,333 --> 01:17:00,333
- Bit late? Why? Where's he gone?
- I don't know.

968
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,250
Ah, Paul.

969
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,833
- Hermann.
- Been a long time.

970
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,792
We've been watching
your progress with interest.

971
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,417
- Haven't we, Lothar?
- Yes.

972
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,042
We had great ambitions for you.

973
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:09,208
Really.

974
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,542
We've been a bit disappointed frankly.

975
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,708
Seems you prefer courting elderly women

976
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:18,792
to caring about the fatherland.

977
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You got charm.

978
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,292
Have good looks.
Your country needs you.

979
01:18:31,417 --> 01:18:33,792
Well I see your surroundings
haven't changed.

980
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:35,542
We shall have you in the end.

981
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:39,875
I shall have you.

982
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,708
- Gigolos and such.
- The son, of course.

983
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,292
Oh, did you notice?
Gone for nothing.

984
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:06,500
Gone for nothing.

985
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:25,583
As I look around me
and I see the lower races

986
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:27,250
that have swarmed into our country

987
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:30,750
over the last decade.
I ask myself, who are they?

988
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:33,792
And are they German?

989
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,042
'Course, they're not.

990
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:49,542
You see, in a sense,

991
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:51,667
our intent is not to unite Germany,

992
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,667
but to unite the German people.

993
01:19:53,917 --> 01:19:56,000
The purity of our race
that was sucked from us

994
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,875
by the so called victors of the war.

995
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,500
From our lookout posts all over the city,

996
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,833
we can watch the degeneration
of our society.

997
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:06,125
But are we just gonna stand by and watch?

998
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:10,917
No!

999
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:11,917
"No!" No!

1000
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:14,167
No! No!

1001
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:17,583
Are we gonna allow our country,
our heritage, our women,

1002
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:20,458
to be... to be used
as a breeding ground

1003
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:22,875
for genetic mediocrity,
are we gonna allow them

1004
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,167
to do that? No!

1005
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:26,792
No! No!

1006
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,625
"No! {Crowdl No!"

1007
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:31,042
We must put a stop to it
before our own physical fitness

1008
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:32,792
and our mental lucidity is jeopardized.

1009
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:35,375
We will not let them get away
with it will we?

1010
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,833
No! No! No!

1011
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:41,125
And are we gonna show them
our superiority, our strength,

1012
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:43,417
- and our unity?
- No!

1013
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,500
Yes.

1014
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:47,542
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1015
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:48,947
- Yes!
- And what're we gonna do?

1016
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,833
- Fight.
- Fight. Fight. Fight.

1017
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:25,792
Why am I surrounded by idiots.

1018
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,667
There's been in a lot
in the papers recently.

1019
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:35,417
I think this man from Munich
is a strong influence.

1020
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:36,917
- Maybe.
- Mm.

1021
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,125
But I don't think so.

1022
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:43,708
Mm. No, but listen to me.
I think there is far too much.

I hear you're quite good

1035

By the way, I have a new husband now.

1036
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:01,583
Any general we know?

1037
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:08,125
His name is Antonio Jose Felipe de Roberto.

1038
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:11,625
Is his nose broken?

1039
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:13,667
I beg your pardon.

1040
01:25:14,458 --> 01:25:15,458
Doesn't matter.

1041
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,792
- Where did you find him?
- Argentina.

1042
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,167
So the tango has become your lifestyle.

1043
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:26,542
He is one of the richest man in the world.

1044
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,583
He's got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.

1045
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,583
By the way, we've bought you off the night.

1046
01:25:34,917 --> 01:25:35,917
I'm booked?

1047
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:39,333
Yes, room 217.

1048
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:42,125
Uh, Helga...

1049
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:44,208
My room.

1050
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:48,667
I may be a gigolo, Frau Von Kaiserling,

1051
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:49,833
but I'm not a whore.

1052
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,583
Let's not split hairs, shall we?

1053
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:54,333
After all it's not like
we haven't been bred.

1054
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,917
Besides, there's an extra
100 dollars there for you.

1055
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:01,917
And the husband?

1056
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:04,625
Actually, it was his idea.

1057
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:07,583
You see, he's desperately
in need of an heir.

1058
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:11,292
He's obviously incapable
of providing one himself.

1059
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:15,042
So I convinced him
that no substitute would be

1060
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:18,708
quite so appropriate as an officer

1061
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:20,542
of Prussian descent.

1062
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:23,917
Thank you.

1063
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:28,375
Besides, it's a good excuse
to see you again.

1064
01:26:29,542 --> 01:26:32,792
- A very expensive excuse.
- Of course.

1065
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:37,125
But I'm paying so dance.

1066
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:03,542
Thank you.

1067
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,083
Does he have to stare like that?

1068
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,667
One of his conditions.

1069
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:27,375
I don't think so.

1070
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:33,875

1080
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,333
Good evening, Father.

1081
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:26,682
What are you looking at me like that for?

1082
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,667
You know it's easy for you to talk.

1083
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:35,250
I mean you had it made.

1084
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:39,042
Everything you could ever have hope for.

1085
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,958
War, famine, pestilence.

1086
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:45,125
You had it all. I mean,
it really wasn't difficult

1087
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,083
to be somebody under those conditions.

1088
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,730
I don't know why but people don't seem

1089
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,150
to want that kind of thing anymore.

1090
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:52,958
All they think about is forgetting.

1091
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:54,938
And most of them have already forgotten

1092
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:56,838
what it was they were supposed
to forget anyway.

1093
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,147
And the only thing about the past

1094
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:00,272
that they do remember is that
there was something back there

1095
01:31:00,292 --> 01:31:01,852
that they weren't supposed to remember.

1096
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,688
I mean it really doesn't matter
whether they remember it or not

1097
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:07,147
because they've forgotten it anyway.

1098
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:08,167
You see what I mean?

1099
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,000
Meanwhile I'm at the Eden.

1100
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:14,042
I know what you're gonna say.

1101
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:17,208
It's not really the sort of career

1102
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:19,253
that you can walk down
the street and brag about.

1103
01:31:19,917 --> 01:31:21,042
Being a gigolo, I mean.

1104
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:25,188
But most of the people
that I pass the street,

1105
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:26,750
I mean, they don't care anyway.

1106
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:28,563
They don't know the difference.

1107
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:30,458
And if they did care, they'd start a war.

1108
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:31,875
And I'd be back in action.

1109
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:34,292
You see I have got it all sorted out.

1110
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:37,083
You will be proud of me, Father.

1111
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:39,667
Get out while you still have a chance.

1112
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:42,417
Go somewhere, anywhere.

1113
01:31:43,417 --> 01:31:44,958
Marry a rich American.

1114
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,792
You can always get a divorce.

1115
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,125
They do that over there a lot, you know?

1116
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:51,375
I'm very tired, Mother.
I'm going to bed.

1117
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,583
- Cilly's back in Berlin.
- Why?

1118
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:56,917
She's getting married to a prince.

1119
01:31:57,583 --> 01:31:58,583
When?

1120
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:02,083
Saturday.

1121
01:32:04,542 --> 01:32:05,542

- My dear.
- Oh, hello.

1130
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:56,667
- Well, lieutenant.
- Congratulations, sir.

1131
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,875
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Thank you.

1132
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:04,958
Well, well, well, I think
we're a little tired

1133
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:07,000
of shaking hands, aren't we?

1134
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,542
Why don't the pair of you enjoy yourself.

1135
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:17,792
Thank you.

1136
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:21,417
Oh, Grisella, my beauty...

1137
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:24,042
I knew you'd come.

1138
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:26,917
- Did you?
- Yeah.

1139
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:30,542
Comet's like you always visit
the stars every couple of years.

1140
01:33:32,042 --> 01:33:34,042
I saw your film two and half times.

1141
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:37,917
Let's go.

1142
01:34:06,417 --> 01:34:08,042
Well, if it isn't our gigolo.

1143
01:34:09,167 --> 01:34:11,000
What are you doing at a function like this?

1144
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:13,292
Oh, we're moving up
in the world, lieutenant.

1145
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:14,480
People are thinking it's about time

1146
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,792
they got to know us.
Congratulations.

1147
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:21,292
Hello, captain.
Enough pleasant young ladies

1148
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:23,125
and gentlemen around here for you?

1149
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,625
- Thank you.
- Oh, incidentally,

1150
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:29,000
there's a friend of yours here from Munich.

1151
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:31,625
Perhaps, you would like to see him.

1152
01:34:33,792 --> 01:34:35,583
This is my wedding and you're my present.

1153
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:37,083
And besides now I can afford you.

1154
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:38,625
- Can you?
- Yes.

1155
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,208
I'm very expensive.

1156
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:48,000

I'll do my best, but we need more people.

1163
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,897
How many men have we got
at party headquarters?

1164
01:36:12,917 --> 01:36:15,833
Not many. There'd be more,
if we would have been notified.

1165
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:20,750
- Where are the Reds now?
- Nearing Savignyplatz.

1166
01:36:23,292 --> 01:36:24,708
Okay. I'm out.

1167
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,083
Sorry.

1168
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:38,875
I have to leave tomorrow morning
at 8:00 to start in a film.

1169
01:36:40,417 --> 01:36:41,417
And then?

1170
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:43,417
Back to Hollywood.

1171
01:36:44,667 --> 01:36:45,667
I see.

1172
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:47,958
It's not sure though.

1173
01:36:51,042 --> 01:36:52,542
Congratulations Cilly.

1174
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,458
From revolutionary to princess.

1175
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:58,208
I told you I was a star.

1176
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:04,875
Why don't you stay with me?
Just for tonight.

1177
01:37:06,292 --> 01:37:10,958
- After all, it's you I married.
- I have my duties to think of.

1178
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:14,208
Why don't you think about your heart?

1179
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:20,042
Well, if you should comeback...

1180
01:37:21,792 --> 01:37:24,000
and if you should want to see me.

1181
01:37:25,458 --> 01:37:26,625
I'll be at the Eden.

1182
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,625
If you find the Baroness ahead of time...

1183
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:36,417
I'm sure you'll get a reservation.

1184
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:07,125
Igunshoq.

1185
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:11,083
The Nazi's did it.

1186
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:17,000
- Is he one of ours?
- I don't know.

1187
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:26,542
- He's one of ours.
- No! He is one of ours.

1188
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,917
- He's one of ours.
- No! He is one of ours.

1189
01:40:31,042 --> 01:40:32,042
Save it.

1190
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:39,875
Well, well, well.

1191
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:43,208
It's destiny.

1192
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,125
Well done, lieutenant.

1193
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:53,750
Take him to party headquarters.
Full military honors.

1194
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:58,208
We'll make him one of the party
whether he likes it or not.

1195
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:01,417
That's what we need.
An elegant death.

1196
01:41:03,542 --> 01:41:05,708
Why to the party headquarters?

1197
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:07,417
He's not one of ours.

1198
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:10,250
Don't worry.
We'll make him a hero.

1199
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:38,667
Oh...

1200
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:42,333
My son.

1201
01:41:45,042 --> 01:41:48,333
But why are you dressed that way?

1202
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:52,250
These things on all his clothes.

1203
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:57,083
He would never have worn such colors.

1204
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:59,458
Are you absolutely sure he was one of you?

1205
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,375
One of the best.
One in a million.

1206
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,042
Was it a bullet'?

1207
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,208
