1
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,371
Cherry, Why did you bring me here?

2
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,334
Shit! I'm scared

3
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,736
wait and see
I will do triple loop jump

4
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,489
Ah... go ahead

5
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,219
Why did you bring cell phone?

6
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,779
Incase someone call

7
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,176
Who?

8
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,330
Is it Tum?

9
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,694
Have you ever felt, you didn't
want to pick up?

10
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,248
But want to know, is it him?

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,618
I did erase his name from my list

12
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,460
So I will forget he calls

13
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,053
You start again

14
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,212
This disease is an uncureable,
it always come and go

15
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,895
But this time is different

16
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,933
Why? you don't want to go

17
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,178
I did not say I did not want to go

18
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,528
Just ask beach again

19
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,651
It means you don't want to go

20
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,656
Do you know you have change?

21
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,417
First time I saw Noon

22
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,571
Noon did not act like this

23
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,458
What did I act?

24
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,258
Now, what do I do?

25
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,929
Before Noon can take care yourself
you can go anywhere alone

26
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,730
Later you stick to me like twin

27
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,334
Noon will go where ever I go

28
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,809
Noon wants to go some place,
Noon will make me go too

29
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,975
Noon, do you still remember
two circles story?

30
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,011
I think Noon cross the line

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,614
If you feel that way,
we should brake-up

32
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,539
It may be better that way

33
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,409
You think the string will tear down

34
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,489
Afraid

35
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,619
So you're not afraid

36
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,730
Afraid

37
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,253
But if we can do the scariest thing

38
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,694
We don't have to scare anything forever

39
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,896
Noon, you talk like Plato with me

40
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,812
I want to go work, save money
and sightseeing abroad

41
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,179
My aunt lives in London

42
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,657
I did call, she should be able
to help

43
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,379
About your college

44
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,054
Don't worry, we will know
when the time come

45
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,899
You want to go with me

46
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,855
How can we live?

47
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,134
I don't know

48
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,139
I think we will have fun
Once in a life time

49
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,497
London, Paris

50
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,299

52
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,895
Gondola

00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,333
Pizza Tower

54
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,617
We will not let other down, right

55
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,409
Go

56
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:22,575

You can build the whole house

00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,095

you can't pack it?

489

What should we celebrate?
Big party, ok

494
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,578
What is it "big party"?

495
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,611
Don't forget we are poor?

496
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,815
Ok, do it this way

497
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,649

00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,890
Why go.. it's fun here.

501
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,450
What's fun!... Working all day?

502
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,814
Not even sight seeing.

503
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,336
You see.. Working all day,
my hands get rotten.

504
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,092
At the end, have to eat
this expired pork.

505
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,974
Should we go home?
I've got the tickets.

506
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,256
But I don't have any,
mine is a one way.

507
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,734
What made it a one way?

508
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,378
Since we went get it together.

509
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,052
I exchanged it later.

510
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,419
Then.. Why won't you say something?

511
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,856
I tried to tell you but I can't
find any right moment.

512
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,458
What right time?

513
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,892
How long have we been together?

514
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,299
It' been 3 months, you know?

515
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,094
You can't find the right time or
you don't want me to know?

516
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,217
Why I don't want you to know?

517
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,288
Then, why don't you tell?

518
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,972
What is the different?

519
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,689
I didn't take your ticket and sold it.

520
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,459
That ticket is mine.

521
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,134
It's not your business if i go or not.
Why do you care?

522
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,654
Of course... I care.
Why do you lie?

523
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,137
We came here together.
And you want me to back alone.

524
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,369
It's my business too

525
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,330
It was you
You gave my address to Tum

526
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:57,529
I know you will not remember
my bithday

527
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,974
What is this?

528
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,610
You want to doublecross me again
Tell me everything

529
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,929
Hey... It's too much

530
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,492
I did not double cross you

531
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,817
Tum wants to be your friend

532
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,049
Why are you so angry?

533
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,608
But I did not want to be his friend
It true

534
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,897
Why are you watching this video? Why?

535
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,779
Why not, used to be friend

00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,530
broke up then you hate him

537
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,296
Tum did not want to be your
boy friend

538
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,816
But he wants to be your friend,
what wrong?

539
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,577
You did wrong and won't accept
wrong doing

540
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,937
You act like that, that
why you've to be here

you just right that,
Tum can't tolerate you

544
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,175
Can you talk like human?

545
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,098
Today I can not,
I hurry to be back home

546
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,777
It's rush hour

00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,691

Pisit

558
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,252

Come here to study!

561
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,379
Used to study, not now

562
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,734
How about you?

563
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,778

564
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,736

567
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,292
How do you know, I am Thai?

568
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,693
Don't care traffic light,

569
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,014
only Thai has these two thing in one

570
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,695
Pisit, you are clever

571
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,452
It's not about clever

572
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,371
Nothing about clever,
This is an observation

573
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,172
Where are you going?

574
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,251
Go home
Oh..

01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,014

If I ask you, I will say come with me

01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,815
I only ask you don't want to follow me

579
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,214
You mean I follow you by myself

580
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,574
Have I ever said that?

581
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,329

01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,579

01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,775
Lee Lander

596
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,328
Lee Lander, wake up

597
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,856
Sleeping again

598
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,533
Nothing better to do, man

599
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,769
Say Hi to Noon

600
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,409
Hey, how you doing, honey?
Hi

601
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,535
Lee Ander from United State

602
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,775
This is Noon

603
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,653
Here Junko, Japanese American

604
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,415
No japanese, no english
only France

605
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,579
Wait here!

606
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,130
Water

607
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:11,857
ok

608
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,775
Hot or cold

609
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,009
Cold

610
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,375
Wait until it cool down

611
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:25,340
No water.. No electricity...
How you guys live!

612
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,978
It sounds impossible to the one
who never try.

613
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,298
But when it is time,
any one can live here.

614
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,137
How much is the rent?

615
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,375
It's free.

616
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,211
Umm.. Is the owner fine with it?

617
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,490
The owner is the French's government.

618
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,854
No complaint

619
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,454
Once in a while,
They come to check and fine.

620
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,177
When they come... You guys just
hide in the jar... Just like that?

621
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,098
Why run away, just pay the fine

622
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,379
Fine, How much?

623
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,811
2,000 euro
Ha..

624
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,979
Why do you pay?

625
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:05,857
sneak in and live here

626
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,413
It's right that they fine us.

627
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,015
With 2,000 euro you can rent
a nice house for several month.

628
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,092
I like living here.

629
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,731
What are they doing?

630
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,258
They are preparing for the presentation,
next month is the time to pay the fine.

631
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,170
Party, beer, ticket and art show

632
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,892
I'm set up exhibition

633
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,859
want more labor

634
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,096
yes, want more

635
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,855
Where have you been?

636
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,098
I ask you, where have you been?

637
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,694
not your business

638
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,138
I did not sleep all night

639
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,739
Do you remember?

640
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,494
Come back or not, it's my life

641
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,093
nothing to do with you

642
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,730
no, no, don't, don't police will lock me

643
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,569
Hey

644
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,015
Noon

645
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,579

01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:31,332

01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,770
what do you want?
Here it is

01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:52,772
Taste good

664
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,619
Not at all

665
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,173
You..

666
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,488
How are you right now?

667
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,213
It's ok

668
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:22,855
How about you?

669
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:24,215
Fine.

670
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,653
Let me have straight talk

671
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,131
Sh... So-o-o lonely.

672
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,694
Same here.

673
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:35,815
Let's do this.

674
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:39,171
From now on, we will not mad at
each other more than a day. All right?

675
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:43,059
And you.. You can talk straight to me.

676
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:46,697
And I will not complain

677
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,294
anything... not washing the plates,
not clean up the room..

678
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,610
even drying the cloth on the heater.

679
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,454
I'll try.

680
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,451
Hey.. Are you pick on me?

681
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,378
Umm... Can I ask you something?

682
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,771
The thing that you complained
the day before

683
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,093
You said...

684
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,614
Did it really my fault?

685
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,576
Yes.

686
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,048
Hey... What?

687
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,653
Tomorrow you will not mad at me anymore?

688
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,969
Cher... ry!

689
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,449
You... You...

690
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,139
Are you fish for your food?

691
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:57,698
It's not easy to buy

692
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,894
It's easy but just eat

693
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:03,019
What your fishing reason!

694
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,174
I did fishing fish

695
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,450
The outcome is the same... eating fish.

696
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,614
It's all you can think. That's it.

697
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:15,370
Nowadays people think more
about the outcome than how to.

698
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:19,695
But for some people, all they
want is the hard old way.

699
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,458
Just because they think
it is elegant.

700
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,733
Some people just think easy
until get used to it

701
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,490
At the end, become negligent

702
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,690
He is strange like you said.

703
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,012
Yeah... Pisit

704
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,138
Is this her who got kick out?

705
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,252
Yeah... This is Cherry.

706
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,450
Just one night, he already
knows everything.

707
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,209
How about you Pisit,
what are you studying?

708
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,451
I told you, I'm not in school.

709
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,980
Then, what are you doing?

710
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,179
Just live

711
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,134
What are you doing with your life?

712
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,212
It's tough enough to just live.
What else you want me to do?

713
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,370
You don't want to work.

714
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,097
Sometimes when the money's gone.

715
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:10,412
That's what I am asking,
what kind of work?

716
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:11,890
restaurant

717
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,698
That's our job too.

718
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,298
I don't like this beard man

719
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,699
He's so irritate.

720
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,976
Take it easy.

721
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,652
He's just a little strange.

722
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,696
but straight forward.

723
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,535
Do you have free time today?

724
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,090
It's our day off.
We come to help.

725
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,813
Cherry come to help too

726
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,411
So what can we help?

727
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,969
What can you do?

728
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,732
Many things

729
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,458
Anything need to be done?

730
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,132
Quite a few.

731
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,339
pack, clean up and some paint.

732
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,654
Can you paint?

733
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:17,490
sure.

734
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:27,176
The boat is go here, ok

735
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,378
Listen, no, no, listen

736
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,774
Stop.. Stop..

737
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,129
What's up?, what?

738
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,578
Oh.. Why don't you move the stage?

739
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:52,256
near by the piano and interesting wall.

740
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:56,049
This boat should be move to over there

741
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:58,974
cause there enough space for and

742
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:03,019
This installation
is not to high, not to big

743
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,809
Should move to around here
and up there

744
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:11,850
So many people can walk
thru this way

745
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,089
Isn't it?
What do you think?

746
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,895
Boys, you're good

747
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,737
Yeah... She said she
study Architecture

748
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,653
You should bring your work
here to enjoy us

749
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,935
What you think?

750
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,573
I will think about it

751
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,299
Tonight I plan to help Roberto
set up, you want to go too?

752
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,050
I will

753
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,777
How is it? Good?

754
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,291
No.. No. I didn't..
You just get it wrong.

755
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:17,258
It's them, the girl come with us

756
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,456
Don't lie, I have the proof.

757
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:28,096
When I count to three,
just run to the train.

758
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:33,175
1.. 2.. 3

759
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:43,937
Cherry, What should we do if
the police gets us?

760
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,938
Hey, can not get caught.

761
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,371
I'm sorry. I'll never
do it again.

762
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:55,372
If I get away this time,
I'll never do it again. Sorry.. Sorry..

763
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,288
Let's get off on the next one.

764
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,535
Unbelievable!

765
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:57,408
Yeah.. It is..

766
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,777
We almost get caught this time.

767
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:04,372
If I get caught, They will
send me home, right

768
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:07,335
You act like you're not care about me

769
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,097
Both of you wrong
Why did you point finger to someone else?

770
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,499
Why did you blame on ome?

771
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,169
It's not true

772
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:20,014
If we didn't want to do,
no one can control us

773
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,053
you follow what she did,
you have the same quilty

774
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:26,618
you're never sneak into the train

775
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:28,814
No, never

776
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,613
What about,
you did not have money?

777
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,369
just walk

778
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,659
walk, walk and look at scenery,
very enjoy

779
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,337
Have you tour Paris yet?

780
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,131
act like you did not agree

781
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:46,371
Because I have to work

782
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,896
cut vegetable, cut pork

783
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,898
Thailand has no job like this

784
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,450
Strange... other want to come
here but have no opportunity

785
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,337
You are here but stay in kitchen

786
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,339
How about, I escort
you for one day

787
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:07,139

Only the day,
I want to wake up early

792
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,253

01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:36,456

It's beautiful

798
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,453
You want to race

799
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,689
Let you run first

800
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,895
Wait for you, I have short legs

Taste good

804
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,689
I cook

805
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:24,459
Why did you make funny face?

806
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,569
It's very dry

807
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,134
Thristy

808
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,735

815
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,099
Sure it warms

816
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:15,256
It's hot, can it be warm?

817
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,695
you want go anywhere else

818
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:50,088
You want to take me there

819
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,252
Who said local people hardly
smile, raise your hand

820
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,173
who has home sick, clap your hand

821
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,573
This type of weather should have
someone to hug, who agree raise your hand

822
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,811
You want this
I want

823
01:26:58,740 --> 01:26:59,252

824
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:05,539
right in your mouth

825
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,373
Bird, bird

826
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,971
Have you ask a wish from Galileo?

827
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:23,617
Never

828
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:30,499
Do this, push your hans forward
and make a wish

829
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:33,375
if the rock fall down
the same time

830
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:35,936
It means your wish will come true

831
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,498
I make a wish, first

832
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,651
1.. 2.. 3

833
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:49,810
What is your wish?

834
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,656
Can not tell

835
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:54,930

can not tell

841
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:26,135
Noon, Bus stop sign is over there

842
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,616
enough

843
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,498
We did not come to Paris
to stay in the kitchen, ok

844
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,089
Cherry

845
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,652
We will not work in the kitchen

846
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,370
You think about light job

847
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,539
Good money

848
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,059
less labor

849
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,530

850
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:59,454

851
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,459
But I think it worth

852
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:37,893
Cherry, that table said
she is your friend

853
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,975
Err.. Hey

854
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,375

Mue's friend, Cherry and Noon

Yeah!

860
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,057
You've got a job?

01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:54,856

Nat skips to TV career.

Ex, Pol, and Tim are in school in USA.

871
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,810
But you are the best.

872
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,778
From architecture to dancer.

873
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,613
I didn't recognize
you at the first place.

874
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,010
This May

875
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,534
you have to fininsh your college's admission,
don't just have fun dancing around.

876
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,338
Cherry, Pee Chaat called

877
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,335
I have to go.

01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:30,092
Now?
Yeah... Bye Bye

879
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,331
Hello

880
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,256
Dad.. It's me.

881
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:08,939
You have not called for a while.

882
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:13,331
How are you?

883
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:18,971
Fine. It starts getting cold.

884
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:20,379
Is it cold there?

885
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,859
Cold

886
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,012
wear something to keep you warm

887
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,139
and cover up at night.

888
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,376
Umm.

889
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:43,654
What is it?

890
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:51,368
Umm.. Next time don't send me any money.

891
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,178
I have enough.

892
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:54,929
Umm

893
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:02,810
Have you fought with Noon?

894
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,253
No.

895
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,895
A- ngoon always talks about you.

896
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,571
Dad.. I get to go.

897
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:59,608
Is it leaning just like the
Leaning Tower of Pizza?

898
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,815
Yes

899
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,055
You're good too.

900
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,769
I know.

901
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:11,532
Have you been there?

902
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:14,739
No

903
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,853
One day I will go there

904
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:18,456
What to go for?

905
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:21,453
Just for a make believe picture
that you 're carrying the tower?

906
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,174
Like this?

907
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:27,218
Go left.. a bit more.. Like this?

908
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,495
Just to see why it doesn't fall.

909
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:43,296
Right.. a bit more

910
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:43,618
Up, up, ok

911
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:47,818
a bit, a bit, up

912
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,334
Umm... ok

913
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:55,856
You should go finish your school.

914
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,976
Admit your mistake and start again.

915
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,619
it's a waste.

916
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,373
I am not wrong. Why admit?

917
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,970
What's not wrong?

918
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:07,573
fraud teacher's signature?

919
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:09,859
wrong for sure

920
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:14,133
I understand that is a harsh punishment.
But wrong is wrong.

921
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:16,370
one day people will know
that I am not wrong.

922
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,974
It will take time to proof yourself.

923
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,178
Like Galileo

924
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:25,413
He said Earth is not
the center of the universe

925
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,492
They put him in jail. And now

926
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:31,694
Every one knows Galileo is right.

927
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,575
But you... are wrong.

928
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:39,297
Make a mistake.. accept it

You like it?

939
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:28,499
I love it

940
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,209
Is it your work?

941
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,009
This is Cherry.

942
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,249
Cherry.. This is jusepe

943
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,295
Jusepe.. this is Cherry.

944
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:39,217
I like your work very much

945
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:43,529
Do you think?
It really can be build

946
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:47,974
Of course

947
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:02,532
But the real one won't collapse

948
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:04,975
There be strong foundation

949
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:06,932
It might be risky

950
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:11,288
But the beauty is worth to risk

951
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,375
Isn't it?

952
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,018
I like you

953
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,050
Do you want to work with me?

954
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,172
I have a company in Milan.

955
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,730
Not big but I have a job
for you if you want

956
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:27,570

957
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:28,979
But you have talent

958
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:31,654
I don't have work permit also

959
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:35,490
Don't worry. I will take
care of that for you too

960
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,730
You can start training in January.

961
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:45,333
If I work with you

962
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,730
Can you allow me to use your drafting room?

963
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:50,890
Sure, Why not..

964
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:54,256
Do I need permission from
you to use it?

965
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:56,092
No, you don't

966
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,092
You can use it at any
time that you want

967
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,648
really?

968
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:04,413
ok, ok

969
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,929
Can I borrow your mobile phone?

970
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:14,570
Hello

01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:17,333
Hello Dad I get a job

And I can use the drafting room too.

01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,492
He will take care of my work permit.

01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:34,094
You don't have to worry about me.
I've got a job.

979
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,013

983
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,815

984
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,096

01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,088
You afraid that I will see you off?

986
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:11,009
I'm afraid of changing my mind.

987
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,175
Aunty, I'm leaving

988
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,772
You guys almost miss the train.

989
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:02,894
I'll wait for inside the train

990
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,258
You know that when the train leave

991
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,418
We may never see each other again.

992
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:16,938
Then we will not... address...

993
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,849

01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:12,610
Tum.. noonnitta@hotmail. com

995
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:53,776
I don't really like him.

996
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:55,733
but he's ok.

997
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,377
Hello
May I speak to Naruemon?

998
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:18,654
Mom went shopping.

999
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,453
It's been a while.. How is it?

1000
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:28,052
Where on earth are you?

1001
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:29,534
In Italy, dad

1002
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:53,293
What do you think if I go back to Paris?

1003
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,619
You're sure about it?

1004
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:59,498
You think, is it gonna work?

1005
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:02,093
How can I know!

1006
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:05,732
If you want to know, you should
try to know him more.

1007
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,173
How about you? You will
not go back to finish your school?

1008
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,898
Don't worry about me.

1009
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:16,088
So.. when will you go to Paris?

1010
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:20,737
May be after New Year, Just want
to spend time going around with you.

1011
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:23,372
And leave you at Milan

1012
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:27,332
Then you go to work,
I'll go to Paris

1013
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:32,288
On April 29...

1014
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:33,769
We'll meet at Pizza.

1015
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,859
Chau

1016
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:07,289
Where are you from?

1017
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:12,093
Thailand

1018
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,689
Thai people are very nice

1019
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,090
Tom Yum Gung.. very good.

1020
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:19,932
I love Thailander

1021
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:22,291
Are you tourists?

1022
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:24,610
Yes, we'll be here for a week.

1023
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,009
And then might go to Florence.

1024
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:28,499
Very rich people

1025
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:32,775
Ah.. cheap trip, back packing

1026
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,612
we've only eat once a day.

1027
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:40,017
It's ok,
once in a life time anyway

1028
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:42,014
You want to work

1029
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,375
Here?

1030
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,212
Yes, this is my restaurant

1031
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:53,256
But we can't speak Italian.

1032
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:55,178
Very easy

1033
01:45:55,179 --> 01:45:56,179
Chau, chau
Glacier, Glacier

1034
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:03,895
That all.. you speak Italian now

1035
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:06,853
Only thing you have to do

1036
01:46:06,854 --> 01:46:07,854
is just, uh.. uh..

1037
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:13,569
that's all

1038
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:18,216
This one for Pasta

1039
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:20,451
This is for Pizza.

1040
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:24,329
They are 200 plates
and will be enough for one day

1041
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:25,330
Ok

1042
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:30,017
And now welcome to Fabricio!

1043
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:32,093
We have to sell fresh food every day.

1044
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:40,212
So we start from 200

1045
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:42,018
Here we have 50

1046
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:48,768
150, you're sold out 150,
4 euro each

1047
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,249
It's 600 euro

1048
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:53,729
You gave me 580

1049
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,177
so the different is 20 euro

1050
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:58,132
I have to take it from your money

1051
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:02,772
Please just one mistake
It'll never happen again.

1052
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:06,212
I'm sorry. These are the rule.

1053
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:27,412
It's not that beautiful.

1054
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,172
I didn't buy for you.

1055
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:48,852
What you're gonna do?
If the com stop working.

1056
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,289
Use the phone

1057
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:57,692
Would you like a Gondola trip?

1058
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:01,773
Yes but it is so expensive.

1059
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,736
I have a way.

1060
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:11,812
We go buy the same kind of box.

1061
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:14,175
Then use our boxes to sell

1062
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:15,773
That is cheating.

1063
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:17,691
We won't do that many.

1064
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,657
May be 10 a day

1065
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,209
Fabricio won't get poor.

1066
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,494
This is the last time that
we will spend time together

1067
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:30,375
You cheated at the subway
station before

1068
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,132
It is not the same.

1069
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:35,896
That... We don't know who we
cheat but here... it's Fabricio.

1070
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:37,538
You really can do it?

1071
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:42,299
Nothing happen in the past.
Don't think too much.

1072
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:45,133
It's not about getting away,
It's about right or wrong.

1073
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:46,775
Then... I'll do it.

1074
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,731
Tomorrow you switch to sell
the ice cream.

1075
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,252
That would be weird.

1076
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:56,492
What do you want? You don't want to do it.
And you won't let me do it.

1077
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,416
ok? Just one last time.

1078
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,253
Only this time

1079
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:10,573
You have to promise
not to cheat again.

1080
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:13,491
I promise.

1081
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:02,977
I'm sorry

1082
01:51:04,259 --> 01:51:05,259
I'm sorry

1083
01:51:06,261 --> 01:51:07,261
Cherry

1084
01:51:07,262 --> 01:51:08,262
It's not you
Out

1085
01:51:09,263 --> 01:51:10,263
she's my friend

1086
01:52:16,887 --> 01:52:17,910
Cherry.. Jusepe..
Help

1087
01:52:18,912 --> 01:52:21,350
I will talk to the police,
and see what they can do

1088
01:52:21,385 --> 01:52:23,207
Wait for me here,
Ok

1089
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:54,293
What'd they say
They won't send her to prison

1090
01:52:55,950 --> 01:52:57,816
But they will send her home

1091
01:52:57,817 --> 01:52:58,817
within 24 hours

1092
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:03,213
Can I see her again

1093
01:53:03,345 --> 01:53:05,758
Don't

1094
01:53:05,781 --> 01:53:06,925
Or you're getting in trouble too

1095
01:53:06,926 --> 01:53:07,926
I'm sorry

1096
01:53:41,110 --> 01:53:43,031
Fabricio

1097
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:53,493
Now it is 11.18 pm in Thailand.

1098
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:59,618
Today is Christmas

1099
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:05,696
It is 117 days

1100
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:07,738
From the beginning of this trip

1101
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:12,373
Today

1102
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:16,135
I am so lonely.

1103
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:19,939
damn.. lonely

1104
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,216
Today

1105
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:27,491
We should be together

1106
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:32,619
Because of me

1107
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:34,815
I destroy it all

1108
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,978
Noon, I am sorry

1109
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:49,179
