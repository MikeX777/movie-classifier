1
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:37,616
"THERE'S ROOM UP AHEAD..."

2
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,605
Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

3
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:18,193
Hey, easy!
- Watch out, there are kids!

4
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:22,166
Make way, I gotta go!
- Watch what you're doing!

5
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,136
There's room up ahead.

6
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:34,044
You make me waste time with that!
I don't have any change.

7
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,433
I said there's room up ahead!

8
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:38,414
I gotta get through! Excuse me!

9
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:41,461
Excuse me! I gotta get off! Excuse me!

10
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,267
Young man, one gets off at the front!
- How can I get through?

11
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:50,030
You're telling me that?
- Who else? My grandpa?

12
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,779
Hey, watch out!
- You watch out! I gotta get off!

13
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,760
For how long?
- For a month more.

14
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,270
I got a pass!
- Show me.

15
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,331
I said I got a pass.
- I said show me.

16
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:05,389
If I said I got it, I do!
Whom do you think you're speaking to?

17
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,493
I'll know by the pass.
- There!

18
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,949
Where are you going?
- To the Chinese.

19
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,372
Poker again? - No, bridge!
We had a game last night. - Really?

20
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,119
Ladies, tickets.
- Just imagine, 3 kings!

21
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,145
Three aces and a straight.
Mussi was also there.

22
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:24,865
Still blonde?
- As if! Black as ebony!

23
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:27,600
Didn't she want it red?
- Yes, but her husband made her.

24
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:31,726
He didn't want to see red!
- Like the bulls!

25
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:34,133
Dammit!

26
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:37,818
I never have change.
- How much you need? - Wait, I've a lira.

27
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:42,897
Did you win this month?
- Oh, please! It was bad. I was hexed.

28
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:47,207
Excuse me, did you say
hexed or vexed? - Hexed.

29
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,694
That guy must be an announcer!

30
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,505
Funny!
- Yes.

31
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:59,214
Have you found it? - What?
- The lira. I'll put the rest in.

32
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:01,754
Thank you.
- Here you go.

33
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,662
Make some room here, we can't breathe!
- Fine, go ahead! I'm coming!

34
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:10,303
When do I get off?
- You're still here?

35
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:12,022
Why didn't you tell me?

36
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:15,607
Why didn't you tell me to tell you?

37
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:18,762
You're supposed to tell us when!
- Yeah! Stop!

38
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,793
Well, we passed it.
We've arrived at the end of the line.

39
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:25,356
You call this manners?
Excuse me, excuse me.

40
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:27,910
Go on, please!
There's room up ahead!

41
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,910
Move on, move on! The more people
who come, the more beasts you see.

42
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,119
Isn't that cute!
How did it go?

43
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,147
Move on, move on! The more people
who come, the more beasts you see.

44
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:42,291
Aren't you ashamed of such idiocy?
- What's the matter?

45
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:45,451
My purse!

46
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:47,477
One moment!

47
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,078
Don't touch anything, I'll count it.
One moment!

48
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:58,245
Excuse me! One moment!

49
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:01,393
I must pass through!
Excuse me!

50
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:06,250
Let me pass! What happened?
- They stole my 500 lire!

51
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,394
Are you sure?
- I had it when I got on!

52
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:11,187
Did you look around?
- I did and it's not here!

53
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:14,866
Close off the bus and get the thief!
- Right, Ma'am. A roll call. Doors shut?

54
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,752
Did you stop?
Yeah, we're stopped.

55
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:19,409
One moment! Who among you...?
- What?

56
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,215
That is who played this joke?
- How dare you?

57
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:27,094
I don't dare anything but...
a purse has disappeared!

58
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:29,209
Disappeared!
What are you implying?

59
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:32,555
That's why that guy wanted
to get off right away! - What?

60
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,197
Careful what you say! - Careful or not,
I don't care! If that purse doesn't show...

61
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:40,391
Where's the police station? - How
would I know? Thank God... - Nearby!

62
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,278
The police station? Right of here.

63
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:45,874
Come on, don't worry, be calm.
We'll find it!

64
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:48,873
People!
I ask you for a moment's patience!

65
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:52,788
What's this? - My doctor's waiting!
- I've an appointment which can't wait!

66
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:56,012
What do we have to do with it?
- Hey, young man, I'm not going!

67
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,990
I was always next to you.
You saw, yes or no?

68
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,993
Yes, but that means nothing
'cause the girl was down here.

69
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:05,175
Down here? What are you alluding to?
- I'm alluding nothing.

70
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,580
You were alluding!
- No, I was not alluding!

71
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,246
You alluded!
- May I go blind if I alluded!

72
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,477
He didn't allude.
- But what the heck does this guy know?

73
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:19,995
Look, it's useless, the 500 lire are gone!
- What?

74
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,902
Don't listen to him.
Don't worry, we'll find it.

75
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:25,559
Wanna bet?
- 10 lire? - Done.

76
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,393
Where exactly did you lay it?
- In front there.

77
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,844
Don't worry,
you'll see I'll find it in a minute.

78
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,063
Yeah, right!

79
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:37,592
You always hafta be in front of me?
Excuse me, lemme check. Move a bit.

80
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,236
Keep your hands to yourself!
- Ma'am, please, I was pushed!

81
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,609
I'll give you a push!

82
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,515
What can I do?
- Wax wroth.

83
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,961
What?
- Wax wroth.

84
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:55,053
Wax wroth my foot! You're lucky
a lady's here. Let's go to the station.

85
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,473
Let's go, I'm in a hurry! - People,
remain calm! It'll be just a few minutes!

86
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,814
A half hour?
It's already night!

87
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:05,210
We've been here for 15 minutes.
I've got to go!

88
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,265
I'd sure like to know
where <i>he </i>needs to go.

89
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:12,539
Don't cry. Those who steal
purses are never moved by it.

90
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,770
Three more! - Ah, finally!
- Here we go, eh? - Here!

91
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,808
I'm here!
- Three at a time.

92
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:20,908
But I need to go!
- How funny!

93
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:24,672
What are they making them do in there?
- Get naked. - Really? - Yes.

94
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,319
It happened to me at
the border with my lady boss.

95
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,824
Smuggling.
- No, for heaven's sake. Mrs. Belardi.

96
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:32,183
Belardi? - Margherita!
- Exactly, Margherita.

97
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:35,592
A friend of ours. And you?
- I was her chauffeur.

98
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:40,250
How Margherita gets around!
What is your name? - Bruno.

99
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:44,244
Margherita always has dark drivers!

100
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:47,982
And now? - Trolley.
I drive the tram. The war, you see...

101
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,834
Three more!
- It's our turn? - Yes, go on!

102
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:53,549
Stop! Here I am!
- Ladies first!

103
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,199
Don't give me "ladies"!

104
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,606
Here I am!
- One moment! - Here I am!

105
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:04,894
They were nice, eh?

106
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:08,370
I like the blonde
but I bet she's expensive!

107
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,881
You think only of money.
You too, Miss. So much fuss for 500 lire.

108
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:18,064
Should she laugh? - No, but not cry!
It's not the end of the world. Allow me.

109
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:21,748
It wasn't mine.
It was the rent for my mistress.

110
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:23,189
Are you a maid?
- Yes.

111
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:28,490
And what was Th...?
- Wax wroth.

112
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,083
Three more.
- Courage, Miss, it'll all be fine.

113
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,510
But the 500 lire... bye-bye!

114
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,910
Let's go! Let's not waste time!

115
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,993
I've wasted plenty and I hafta go!

116
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:41,986
Where would <i>he </i>need to go?

117
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:45,265
That's enough, eh?
Cut the chit chat! Open the bag.

118
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:49,730
I'm a professional. I've my cards.
And I refuse! - C'mon, let's go!

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,326
In 20 years of my career,
this has never happened!

120
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:57,119
See! You happy now?
- That's why you were crying, dear.

121
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,847
Silence!
Come forward.

122
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,162
You may go. Excuse me.
- Excuse me! Excuses!

123
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:07,408
Now I'll won't find my clients and who
knows what the consequences will be!

124
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:10,378
If you act like that, your liver'll
be bad. - What do you mean?

125
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,924
It needs some onions!

126
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,514
You were robbed?
- Yes.

127
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:18,899
I'm sorry but the thief must've
got off before you realized it.

128
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:22,637
Anyway, we've your address
and will contact you if needed.

129
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,846
Sign there.
You two as well.

130
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:31,155
Are you the driver? - No,
the usher Cesare Montani from Rome.

131
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:34,784
Here. Sign.
Gimme 10 lire.

132
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,801
Why?
- Didn't you hear the commissioner?

133
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,156
Good grief!
Why you don't say "wax wroth"?

134
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:47,748
I bet 100 lire that you'll
never say "wax wroth" ever again!

135
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,616
Who knows? Maybe by mistake!

136
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,288
Good day, Miss.

137
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:08,052
730.
- Mondani!

138
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:11,188
Hurry!
The tram must leave right away.

139
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:18,364
Mondani! There was
a robbery in your car, eh?

140
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:24,448
Remember, a tram is not only a machine,
but our life's partner.

141
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:29,479
But yeah with the life you lead you
could end up alone. Always in the clouds!

142
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,035
Always.

143
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:37,382
When I was a tram usher...
- The tram was led by horses.

144
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:42,580
When I was  a tram usher,
I fried the fish and eyed the cat!

145
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,522
Now they fry the cat and eye the fish.

146
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:00,539
Go home and explain how
it was and she'll understand.

147
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:04,788
More than that, I cannot do.
Bye.

148
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,049
Gimme the usual.

149
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:19,954
Didja hear about Lazio?
I'm never wrong. Whadya like?

150
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:23,035
A drop of coffee.

151
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,768
Again!

152
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,845
What's wrong now?
- I can't go home. I'm ruined! Ruined!

153
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:40,899
Well, what can I do?
Eh?

154
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:44,692
What's the matter?
- I'm ruined!

155
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,721
Some people deserve jail!
- Yes!

156
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,633
What are you saying? You crazy?
All  I need is to people to think that...

157
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,267
Well? - I get it, eh!
- Get what?

158
00:11:57,781 --> 00:12:03,299
I brought you to the station, got chewed
out for you, what more do you want?

159
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,178
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:11,031
Where are you going? Hey!

161
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:17,090
What is this nonsense?
It ain't the end of the world, right?

162
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,590
You  don't know. I can't go back alone.
- Fine. Don't go.

163
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:23,711
Why not?

164
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:28,200
My mistress is so mean.
She always says that I'm dreaming

165
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,635
and that I only think of love.

166
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:35,422
Is she right?
- No, Sir. I work all day to the night.

167
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,539
OK, I'll go with you. Let's go.

168
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:46,323
And the coffee? - Keep it warm,
I'll get it later. - OK, I get it!

169
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,355
Here it is.

170
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:08,749
Don't worry. - Whatever happens,
I must say you're so nice. I thank you.

171
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:17,472
There she is finally! The Miss has come!
You dare come at this hour?

172
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,040
Excuse me, Ma'am...
- And who are you? Shame!

173
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,664
Wicked hussy, you bring them
home now? Why not invite them in?

174
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:29,530
Why don't you come in? Have a seat?
Make yourself at home! Please! Please!

175
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,086
Thanks.
- Thanks! Get out!

176
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:36,174
Ma'am, if you keep that up, you'll lose
your voice. It'd be a shame: so sweet!

177
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:40,596
He's even witty! Rude lout!
You should be ashamed at your age!

178
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,351
Lil' Miss Innocent, can't deny
it this time, eh? - Ma'am...

179
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:48,260
You get inside! March!
You've been gone since 5! 2 whole hours!

180
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,483
Ma'am, the 500 lire are gone.
- 2 hours!

181
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,997
What? - Vanished!
- What? - The 500 lire!

182
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:56,865
Can we come in now?

183
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,765
Tullio!

184
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,080
Tullio!

185
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:04,021
Tullio!

186
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,559
Tullio! Come and listen to this!

187
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:12,970
What happened?
- Listen to me! The 500 lire! The rent!

188
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,662
The rent? The 500 lire?

189
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:16,816
Go on! Speak!
- Be calm, Ma'am.

190
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:20,542
How is it possible? Did she lose them?
- No, it's very simple. It was an accident.

191
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:23,795
On the bus, there was a big crowd
and she was robbed. - Great!

192
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:27,390
Robbed? What do you mean robbed?
Who did it? Where is he?

193
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,950
It's being investigated.

194
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:35,434
I told you not to take the bus! Jinx!
Criminal! You're the ruin of our house!

195
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,671
And you don't speak? Not one word?

196
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:42,364
Ah... what time did it happen?
- It happened when it happened!

197
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:45,702
Impossible! Who were you talking to?
What'd he look like?

198
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:48,760
Ma'am, it could happen to anybody.
- Hear how he defends her!

199
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,470
What? I just met her.
Sometimes there's nothing you can do.

200
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,950
Would you like to talk to the landlord
then? - Me? Why should I give a damn?

201
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:59,443
You hear how he answers! You hear that!
They're in cahoots!

202
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,349
What cahoots? I've never seen
her before! It could've happened to you!

203
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,680
Not me! I've a head on my shoulders!
I don't dream of love! - Thank God.

204
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,879
Ma'am, what do you mean by that?
- What I mean? You gab with everybody!

205
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,885
She stops to gab with everybody.

206
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,940
I pay you to serve,
not to flirt on trams!

207
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,190
I know what your type always do!
- You've no right to say that!

208
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,216
No right to say it? You dare to talk back?
Take that!

209
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:27,700
Enough! Shame on you!
- Please mind your own business!

210
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,936
Wait a minute! - What minute!
Must I be scolded by a tram driver?

211
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:34,234
Ma'am... - Oh, yes! You're just a driver!
- A driver!

212
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:38,105
And you're just passengers! - But...
- Quiet, you ride the tram! I've seen you!

213
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:42,644
Aren't you ashamed to treat that girl like
that? And for why? For a few peanuts!

214
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:46,058
Get out! Out of my house!
You too! I don't want to see you again!

215
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,612
Yes.
We're both leaving.

216
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,033
Yes, go away!
- Come on, let's go.

217
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,641
Tullio, you're not letting her leave?
- Ah, no!

218
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,345
She must first pay off what she owes,
then she can go.

219
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,717
The girl will no longer stay here.
- And who will pay us? - Me.

220
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:03,150
Yeah? Go on then!

221
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,512
Here.

222
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:10,665
What's this mean? - Means
you'll get the money on the 27th.

223
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,912
27th! I want it right now!
- You'll get it in installments.

224
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:18,432
50 lire at a time. 10 payments of 50 lire.
Or 500 payments of 1 lira!

225
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:21,430
Make that face again and
I'll make both of you sorry!

226
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:27,033
Don't forget that I'm an official of
the tram company of the streets of Rome!

227
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:30,380
What was that? - I won't repeat it,
saying it took a miracle!

228
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,266
Forget anything? Good.

229
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:39,092
Don't be afraid, I fixed
everything with these people.

230
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:48,225
Wait a second.

231
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:56,222
You again!
- Close the door quietly. Got it?

232
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:03,070
That's more like it.

233
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:38,135
Have any relatives?
- Yes, an aunt.

234
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:41,587
She wrote me once.
But I don't know where she is.

235
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:44,140
Any friends?
- No.

236
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,234
Oh, God! Why did you come here
if you had no relatives or friends?

237
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,923
But it was you...
- Now it's my fault!

238
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:56,947
Before you wouldn't stop complaining.
You cried and begged.

239
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,000
I come with you and now it's my fault!

240
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,070
But I... - What are you saying?
They were hitting you. Can I watch that?

241
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,512
Did you tell me you had no one?
But you lemme leave without a word.

242
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,206
Now where can we go?
To sleep in the gardens?

243
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:20,609
Is there any mark?
- No, it's a little red.

244
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:23,947
Did it hurt?
- A bit.

245
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,773
It felt like I was slapped!

246
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,507
It's quiet here. Are you afraid?

247
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:37,921
It's only one night.
Tomorrow God will provide.

248
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:51,435
May I help you?
- Do you have a room?

249
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,046
Bridal suite?
- No, just for the young lady.

250
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:57,750
Luggage? - What?
- Luggage?

251
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,280
This.
- ID?

252
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,295
That was stolen too!

253
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:11,755
Calm down, it's alright.

254
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:16,955
She has no ID?
- No, her money and ID were stolen.

255
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:22,245
Yeah? I understand.
I'm sorry but... there's nothing I can do.

256
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:26,590
Just for tonight. Then tomorrow...
- Of course. Tomorrow.

257
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,939
Why are you laughing?
- Not me. I'm not laughing.

258
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,820
Yes, you are!
Maybe you don't believe us.

259
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:37,155
I believe it all.
But no ID, no room.

260
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:40,204
Let's go.

261
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:46,291
Laugh!
- I believe there's nothing left to say.

262
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:47,806
Let's go.

263
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,863
May I use the phone?
- Yeah! But be snappy.

264
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,018
Like this?

265
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:02,181
Where are you going?
It's here.

266
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,273
Are you tired?
- A bit.

267
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,652
Not me.

268
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,174
Just 5 flights of stairs to go!

269
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,704
There's 130, but they're tall.

270
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:22,398
I made a joke and you didn't even get it!
They're tall! Let's go. Come.

271
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:35,119
I live here. Under the skylight.

272
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:38,924
I just love climbing stairs!

273
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,492
3 more and we're there.

274
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,539
One, two, three.

275
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,322
Quiet or you'll wake up Mrs. Camilla.

276
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,818
And she's so curious.
- The landlady?

277
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,277
Mr. Cesare!

278
00:21:40,518 --> 00:21:41,532
Good night.

279
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,518
Very nice, Mr. Cesare!

280
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:57,422
It went well. She didn't see you.
Just imagine her being there!

281
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:59,914
I'm afraid.
- Of what?

282
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:05,730
Tomorrow morning
we need to get up early.

283
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:08,964
Here you go.
You sleep here.

284
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:14,077
And you?
- Yeah. I'll make do.

285
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,227
I couldn't let you do that.

286
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:21,884
Quiet!
If I hafta, I'll sleep in the street.

287
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:25,836
You're tired.
And a bit pale.

288
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:31,873
Let's see what Mrs. Camilla
prepared for us. Come.

289
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:37,606
Good! Cod! And it's fried!

290
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:41,311
Sit. - Thank you, Mr. Cesare.
- Let's drop the compliments, eh?

291
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:42,832
You like cod?

292
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:48,397
Cod? I was wrong. It's chicken.

293
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:52,353
But without any bones.
No, it can't be.

294
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,978
What the heck is this?

295
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,396
Potatoes!

296
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,350
Baked and then fried.

297
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:06,491
This ain't potatoes.

298
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:12,397
You see, we eat without knowing what
the heck we eat. But one must eat.

299
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,785
Thank God, it all went well.

300
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:17,274
What did I tell you?

301
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:22,363
Who is it?
- Mr. Cesare, I must talk to you.

302
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:28,211
Can't we do it tomorrow?
- No, right now.

303
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:46,777
What is it, Ma'am?
- A woman. In your room.

304
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:50,281
A woman?
- Mr. Cesare, you mustn't do this.

305
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:52,783
But...
- You know all. - Me?

306
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:58,455
For the blessed soul of my Alfonso
who over there watches over me.

307
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:01,709
He who cared so much
for the dignity of the house.

308
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,839
But if Mr. Alfonso knew the facts...

309
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:09,443
Please, Mr. Cesare, make her leave
right away and don't let it happen again!

310
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:13,101
He'll make her go. Don't worry.
- You think he gives a damn if...

311
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:17,597
Mr. Cesare, please, don't blaspheme!
- For heaven's sake! Don't cry, she'll go!

312
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,387
Right away!
- Right away!

313
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,101
You must leave.

314
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:28,314
Don't do that or I'll hit my
head on the wall again, OK?

315
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,814
It's all my fault.
- Your fault? Your fault...

316
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,359
C'mon, let's go.
- Where?

317
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,096
Who knows? Somewhere.
Go get your stuff.

318
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,818
What a knock!

319
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:41,929
Let's bring some stuff.

320
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,703
The apples, these are really apples,
bread...

321
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,376
She can eat this junk.
Let's go.

322
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:09,555
Are you happy now?
We're going to sleep on the streets.

323
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:21,019
Let him pay the rent!

324
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:31,175
<i>Express from Naples at track 5.</i>

325
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,451
<i>Express from Naples at track 5.</i>

326
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:47,116
We'll be fine here.
First class!

327
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:53,982
Papers!
Papers!

328
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,344
Now what do we do?
- Ballet!

329
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:02,426
What should we do but sleep?
Let's go over there.

330
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:14,669
We'll eat the apple.

331
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:21,215
Tomorrow your mouth'll be so fresh.
Apples freshen you up.

332
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:26,440
What a strange thing life is.

333
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:31,524
This morning we didn't even know one
another and now 'cause of some thief...

334
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:36,889
Who knows where that 500 lire went to!

335
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,468
Here.

336
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:58,691
A dance troop. Merry, eh?
- It must be nice to travel like that.

337
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:02,911
Don't be fooled. So many things
seem nice when you imagine it,

338
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,845
but when you have to live it...

339
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:09,207
They laugh 'cause they have to.

340
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,847
It's written in their contract: laugh.

341
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,685
But on the train,
they curl up and laugh no more.

342
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:21,465
Who has no pain?
Just look at us.

343
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:26,531
So stupid, eh?
Sorry, I don't know what else to say.

344
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:30,669
Go home, Sir.
Don't put yourself out anymore.

345
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:35,038
Don't worry, have no doubts.
You sleep and tomorrow I'll come back.

346
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,807
But if you don't fall asleep,
how can I go?

347
00:27:38,972 --> 00:27:42,288
If one doesn't begin,
no one sleeps. Lean back.

348
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:45,740
Go night-night.

349
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:14,223
<i>Express from Venice at track 7.</i>

350
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:19,923
<i>Express from Venice at track 7.</i>

351
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:24,126
You're back already.
- Sure.

352
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,680
You stayed here.

353
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,273
I fell asleep I too.

354
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,166
We must go.
- Where?

355
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:37,513
To have a latte.
Warm up the tummy.

356
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:44,761
Papers!
Papers!

357
00:28:53,707 --> 00:28:57,292
I'll see if there's something for you.
- You think the papers will mention it?

358
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,056
What?
- The theft.

359
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:03,201
Please! I'm looking for a job for you.
- Oh, yes, I hope so.

360
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:05,631
Here we go.

361
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:10,680
"Campo Marzio 37,
seeks a girl Friday, good looks".

362
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,855
We got the good looks down.

363
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:16,439
If you show up like this
they won't take you.

364
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:19,833
Let's go to Campo Marzio 37.

365
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,412
I'll change and go with you.

366
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:35,478
Giovannino! Giovannino, go answer it!

367
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:38,078
I'll get it!
- Mama told me!

368
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:40,795
Don't play so loud! What the heck!

369
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,361
Will you move?

370
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,799
Get down now! Get...

371
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,210
Hello, we read your ad seeking a lady.

372
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:55,599
Grandpa! The maid is here!
The maid is here!

373
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:57,587
Quiet!

374
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,531
I must talk. This way, please.

375
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,844
Sweet! So sweet!

376
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,953
I'll kill you, drug addicts!
- Quiet! Knock if off now!

377
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:16,007
She studies. Studies the piano.
She's having her exam soon.

378
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:20,485
Everything in order, no?
Yes, I like this girl. Right, Dad?

379
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,959
Will you have a seat?

380
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:29,562
We can talk better sitting down. Yes?
- Yes.

381
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,275
I'll kill you! - I'll kill you!
- Have a seat!

382
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:36,131
Therefore you are...?
- The brother.

383
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,491
Yes, I knew it.
You have the same face.

384
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,274
Good! Very good!
Let's sit down.

385
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:43,281
Get out, traitor!

386
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:48,802
We need to talk, go!
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

387
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:51,632
Ah, boys!
- Ah, kicks!

388
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,450
What?
- Nothing. Are they all yours?

389
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,220
No, no. Two are friends
from the apartment upstairs.

390
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,654
You'll find it just like home.
Unfortunately, my husband isn't here.

391
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:03,551
It's a bit noisy but so very nice!

392
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:07,044
You'll love it. The other girl
when she left was in tears!

393
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:09,530
Right, Dad?
- Ah, yes.

394
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,275
There's not much to do.
Stop!

395
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:16,478
You know I'll slap you!

396
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:20,119
As I was saying,
in the morning you go shopping.

397
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:24,199
But not to those below, good God,
they're thieves! To the market.

398
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:29,517
Next you clean the floors, help me cook.
You're a good cook, right? Very nice!

399
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,237
Then do some small things:
wash, iron, sew!

400
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,758
And then take the kids into the garden.
This way she can have fun too, no?

401
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:40,359
Die!
- Stop it!

402
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:43,194
Eh, make him happy
so he'll go away. Die!

403
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,791
Die!
- Doesn't count! His eyes are open!

404
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:51,115
Close them! Just like that.

405
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,110
Go away now! Go away!
- I want him to die! - Another time!

406
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,547
You'll die later, right?
- I'll kill myself now!

407
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,838
Over there! Go over there!

408
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:04,645
Ah, kids! Kids!

409
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,726
Do you have many? - What?
- Ah, right! You're father and daughter!

410
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:15,239
The girl'll lunch with us.
We eat in the kitchen, right?

411
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,110
And we're here everyday.
So sweet and cozy!

412
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,537
You've no idea how much
stuff costs now. 2000 lire!

413
00:32:22,198 --> 00:32:26,890
This is his crib.
It doesn't look it but it cost 300 lire!

414
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,453
A little thing from Japan.

415
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:34,390
For my part, for heaven's sake!
Everything will be great. Right, Dad?

416
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:38,092
Ah, yes.
Very well.

417
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:43,916
But stop coughing!
Grandpa is playing!

418
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:47,159
By the way, a simple formality:
Do you have a health certificate?

419
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:50,588
'Cause of the kids, disease, we need
this trifle. We'll be living together.

420
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:54,097
You can see she's a healthy girl
but it's better to have it, isn't it?

421
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:57,510
Sure. Tell me, are all
of you healthy? - Yes, indeed.

422
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,014
Do you have a certificate?
- No.

423
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:03,706
Better to have it.
Grandpa has quite a cough...

424
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:07,403
I am...
very... well!

425
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,300
The gentleman is quite right!
I've always said you smoke too much.

426
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:14,844
So where does that leave us?
- Just fine. OK, you understand?

427
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:18,549
Child's play!
You get up at 5 or 5:30.

428
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:20,817
The morning air's so healthy.
It has oxygen!

429
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:23,451
Some market shopping
but not with the thieves below.

430
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:25,952
When you get back
you cook, wash, iron,

431
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:30,193
sew some clothes for the kids,
'cause their things never last long.

432
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:34,330
Then sing some songs at the piano.
Miss plays so nicely and never shuts up.

433
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,552
Then scrub the floors! She may look
delicate but what muscles she has!

434
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:43,212
In fact, if you move, she can
help with the furniture. Are we agreed?

435
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:47,606
But we haven't mentioned pocket money!
- What money? It'll be like a family visit!

436
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:51,630
Right, Dad? You should really watch
him or you might lose him. Good day.

437
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,084
Am I working here?
- Are you nuts?

438
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:02,150
No, we'll find something else.
I just love climbing stairs!

439
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:09,994
Mr. Cesare.
- What's up?

440
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:12,630
Let's hope this time...
- You'll see it'll be good.

441
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:18,158
I've a presentiment...
- Hurry! Come up! Hurry, come up!

442
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:19,477
One moment!

443
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:23,585
I'm afraid that here too...
- Let's get away.

444
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:26,230
Now we're here, let's check it out.

445
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:30,986
He's here! - He's come?
- Yes, he's coming up the stairs!

446
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:34,095
Where is he? - He's here.
- Oh, Virgin Mary!

447
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,946
May I enter? - Finally,
we were so anxious! Gimme that!

448
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,053
I'll take your hat.
- Hurry, in here! You're late.

449
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:47,094
We were expecting you since this
morning. - We were at 4 other houses.

450
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,792
You should've came here right away!
- If we only knew!

451
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:53,458
Some big trouble has
shown up with the feet.

452
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:57,251
Let me in! - Be calm, Mr. Fandulli!
Be calm, it's nothing!

453
00:34:57,455 --> 00:34:59,073
Ginevra! Ginevra!

454
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:02,529
Oh, the doctor! Oh, good day, doctor!

455
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,076
I'm the midwife. Come.
The father is besides himself.

456
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:08,529
Take heart! It's nothing.

457
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,454
You're not the doctor?
- He's the new tenant.

458
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,821
Please, doctor!
Great, doctor!

459
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:17,767
Ice and alcohol! Hurry!
- Yes.

460
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:22,557
Ice and alcohol! Hurry up? - Where?
- In the kitchen! The dining room!

461
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:27,275
Hurry! Hurry up!
I can't take anymore!

462
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:30,036
You come!
- Where? - Come!

463
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:33,282
You come too! To help!

464
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:39,472
Fan the flames!
- I don't want to be a maid! - Hurry!

465
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,119
I have to make it boil. Got it!

466
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,130
Just like that.

467
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:49,000
Careful it doesn't boil over!
- It's boiling.

468
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:52,248
Here's the water.
Please, work it harder.

469
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,955
I can't take anymore!
I can't!

470
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:59,723
You understand?
He's coming out feet first!

471
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:04,750
Feel this! Feel how it beats!
Eh? - Uh! Always like that, daddy?

472
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,476
No, but it's the first time my wife
is giving birth, poor thing, understand?

473
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:11,785
Will it take much longer? - Yeah...
- 'Cause I can't take anymore!

474
00:36:11,855 --> 00:36:13,117
Me too!

475
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:17,487
Feel this here! Feel this!
- I did. - What? - I felt it!

476
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:22,466
Really? I can't stay still!
- Then help fan!

477
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:26,560
No, I can't, impossible!
Here! You fan it 'cause...

478
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:30,283
Well? - It's going well.
- Oh, blessed Madonna!

479
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,771
Mr. Cesare...

480
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:38,463
Hurry up in that kitchen!

481
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:43,060
You don't have worry anymore about me.
I've already given you so much trouble.

482
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:48,294
So much time it takes to be born
and so little time to drop dead!

483
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,925
We're there! We're there!
Harder! Harder!

484
00:36:55,975 --> 00:36:59,875
Ah! He's born! He's born!
- He made it!

485
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:03,593
He's born!

486
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:08,186
A boy! A boy! A boy! A boy!

487
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:16,865
Cheers! Long live our little Cesare!
- Thanks.

488
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:19,651
What? - Thank you.
- Why, it's nothing!

489
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:22,712
We'd like to thank you,
you were great!

490
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,231
Long live our Cesare!
- Thank you.

491
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,628
Who told you my name?
- Nobody. Why?

492
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:33,882
My name is Cesare.
- Just like the Caesars?

493
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,702
Who else? - What a coincidence!
Same name as the boy!

494
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:41,900
A double toast: long live
little Cesare and big Cesare!

495
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,310
Hooray!

496
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:47,779
What a great idea! I want you absolutely
to be my son's godfather. For sure.

497
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,075
The godfather of my son!
- Very good! And she the godmother!

498
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:54,290
The godmother and godfather!
- You see...

499
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,913
Don't refuse, it'd be a sacrilege. You're
name is Cesare and you live here too!

500
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:01,201
I don't live here. - Upstairs?
- No, I live in Via Del Pellegrino.

501
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:04,791
You're not the new tenant?
- I'm an usher. - Usher? - For the tram.

502
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:07,869
We came for the ad.
- Why? How come?

503
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:10,731
"Water heater for sale"?
- No, no, no! The one under it.

504
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:13,165
Ah, we don't need a maid.

505
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:18,566
Ah, the Rossis were looking for a woman.
But they found one this morning.

506
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:23,896
We've been all around since last night.

507
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,946
I thought that here... Too bad!

508
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,071
I should've been at work by now.

509
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:33,838
Now where shall I leave you?
What must I do?

510
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:37,839
Poor girl, she has nobody. No one. Zilch.

511
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:42,487
Mr. Angelo? - Yeah?
- Why don't we keep her with us?

512
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:48,348
Well, you know that... - No! Just for
tomorrow 'til everything is settled.

513
00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:50,112
There's so much to do today.

514
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:54,253
And besides she can be the godmother!
- Ah, right! Very good!

515
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:57,802
It's settled: The girl stays
with us 'til tomorrow morning.

516
00:38:58,245 --> 00:39:00,078
I thank you!

517
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:04,622
But I can't be the godfather.
- Blasphemy!

518
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:09,470
I've never done it before and could
mess it up! - Impossible! Say yes!

519
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:14,309
Excellent! Great!
- I must fly! - Where to?

520
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:17,354
I hafta be at work or I'll get fined!
They're so strict!

521
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:20,591
Wait a moment! A moment!
We need to plan the baptism of Cesarino!

522
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:23,115
Saturday? Saturday the 15th at 9, eh?

523
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:26,470
I'll even come tomorrow
now that I started...

524
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,987
Our home is always open.
We're godfathers, right? Got you!

525
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,789
Cesarino! It's him! Excuse me!
- He woke up! - Poor little thing!

526
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,086
Forgive me.

527
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:49,635
You see I can't do anything more:
yesterday the school, today the fine...

528
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:52,425
And now I hafta to be a godfather!

529
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,680
Does it really bother you?
- No, but there'll be relatives...

530
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,344
They're so nice.
- Yeah, they are but so?

531
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,741
I'd like it here.

532
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:06,124
So would I!

533
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:10,917
Maybe they'll ask you to stay.
- I wish!

534
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:16,393
I gotta run, eh?
See ya tomorrow. Goodbye.

535
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:26,653
Are you leaving?
- Yes. Pardon me for a moment.

536
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:33,295
Listen, that girl in there
I just met yesterday on the tram.

537
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:37,403
Her 500 lire was stolen and her mistress
kicked her out. - Oh, poor thing!

538
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:40,814
Since this morning, I've been trying
to find her a job but with no luck.

539
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:43,540
We came here but
it was for the third floor.

540
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,811
Couldn't you find a place for her...
I don't know...

541
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:50,307
Yes, what a coincidence!
Yesterday, my boss fired my coworker.

542
00:40:50,377 --> 00:40:52,914
What do you do?
- Sell movie tickets.

543
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:56,674
That'd be great 'cause she's nice, smart.

544
00:40:57,482 --> 00:40:58,927
Listen.

545
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,598
What are you doing?
- No, no! For heaven's sake!

546
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:07,800
Have her hair done, a manicure,
so she can make a good impression.

547
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,112
Fine, I'll see to it.
- You'd be doing me... a great pleasure.

548
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:14,517
I need to run but I'll be back soon.
- See ya.

549
00:41:14,587 --> 00:41:20,173
If you've any good news, send it
to terminal 6. - OK. - Thanks! - Bye!

550
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:34,323
Mondani!

551
00:41:39,054 --> 00:41:41,825
Always oversleeping and careless!
Listen here, Mondani!

552
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:45,368
Please, it's Montani. - Fine! Mondani
or Montani, you don't mount!

553
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:48,056
What mounts is the tram
which ain't like your drums!

554
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:51,466
There you just need to beat them
and something will come out.

555
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:55,429
The tram is tied to the clock.
And the clock says your 15 minutes late.

556
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:58,154
Don't interrupt me!
Be late again and I fine you!

557
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,689
One hand washes the other. And both
of them can throw you out of the band!

558
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:03,895
And who'll play the drum then?

559
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:06,179
Everybody is useful
but nobody is necessary.

560
00:42:13,954 --> 00:42:15,775
Got chewed out, eh?

561
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,323
I'll knock your head off!

562
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:23,657
How's your adventure going?
- Knock it off. I'm late 'cause of her.

563
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:28,390
Lost your head? - My head!
I've ran around everywhere for her.

564
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,430
But she's cute.
- Yeah, cute. An ugly shrimp.

565
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,896
Mondani!

566
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:41,877
Please, Bellini, be very watchful...
Very.

567
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,893
Let's go.
- You're going with me?

568
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:47,010
And Rossi?
- They called him to duty.

569
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,863
They'll never call you, eh?

570
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:53,471
Bellini, please keep an eye out!
- Don't worry, boss. I got this.

571
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:06,816
"The higher you climb,
the faster you fall."

572
00:43:30,032 --> 00:43:31,927
Watch it, you'll break it!

573
00:43:32,097 --> 00:43:35,194
That's what mechanics are for, right?
- Don't make me laugh.

574
00:43:35,627 --> 00:43:38,599
Maybe... I'm better than you now.

575
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,328
Want to bet I make you mess up?
- Knock of this betting, Bruno!

576
00:43:43,398 --> 00:43:44,452
30 to 10!

577
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:49,860
What will ya make me do?
- I won't tell ya 'til it happens. - Fine.

578
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:57,790
Hey! Hey! Whatcha doing?
- I can't go on.

579
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:03,282
I got no sleep.
And running around all morning.

580
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,810
And the stairs!

581
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:09,652
They never ended.
How my feet hurt!

582
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,435
How I'd like to sleep!

583
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:17,634
But I gotta meet her at the terminal at 6.

584
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:19,405
Her again?

585
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:23,311
You'll say, "Forget about her.
Why should you care?"

586
00:44:23,915 --> 00:44:27,650
I need to take care of her.
- Or have you already taken care of her?

587
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:33,037
You're always like that.
You don't understand certain things.

588
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:38,695
Do you realize what it means to be
alone in the world without any relatives?

589
00:44:39,265 --> 00:44:40,880
Without a soul.

590
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,463
I envy you then. I envy you.

591
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:47,938
I'd like to fall in love but I can't.

592
00:44:49,095 --> 00:44:52,630
Wait, I'm not in love.
- Yeah! Whatever!

593
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,653
No, for heaven's sake. I'm nice.
- Yeah, yeah, I know...

594
00:44:56,723 --> 00:45:00,468
But no! I'd like you to know,
excuse me, but between us...

595
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,173
Never mind.

596
00:45:05,693 --> 00:45:08,815
Change of plan: I'm going now.

597
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:12,468
And call me at 5 or 5:30 tops.

598
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:16,565
I can't go on.
If we continue, I'll run over someone.

599
00:45:16,635 --> 00:45:21,116
Anything else?
- Let's whistle down the street at 5:30.

600
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:27,279
By the way, if the boss asks,
just tell him I drove well.

601
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,103
And then?

602
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,927
Then one day if you need me,
I'll pay you back big time.

603
00:45:38,346 --> 00:45:40,367
What are you doing? Brake!

604
00:45:43,596 --> 00:45:46,055
You braked in park, stupid.

605
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,916
Give me 10 lire and wax wroth.
- Doesn't count.

606
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:54,993
Why?
- Don't count! I was sleeping.

607
00:45:55,063 --> 00:45:57,410
And even if it did count,
I wouldn't give it.

608
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,393
Who can put his hands in his pockets?

609
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:06,303
Wax wroth...

610
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:52,913
Morning, Miss. How are you?
- Fine. Thank you.

611
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:56,500
I barely recognized you.
Remember me?

612
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:01,173
Of course, the driver. But Mr. Cesare?
- Just so. Sent me with his apologies.

613
00:47:01,243 --> 00:47:03,947
Wasn't he free?
- No, he's in training.

614
00:47:04,017 --> 00:47:09,825
I'm sorry. 'Cause I've good news.
Finally, I got a job. I start tomorrow.

615
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:11,627
Nice. I'm glad.
What is it?

616
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:14,732
An employee.
Ticket seller at the Rex Cinema!

617
00:47:16,392 --> 00:47:19,439
I'll have to do a week's trial
and after...

618
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,917
Congratulations!
- I was really lucky.

619
00:47:23,546 --> 00:47:24,785
Well then...

620
00:47:26,114 --> 00:47:30,456
Seeing we're going the same way, if you
don't mind, I'll go with you. - Please do.

621
00:48:18,016 --> 00:48:20,910
You like it here?
- It's very nice. But I gotta go home.

622
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,584
Fine, I'll go with you.
What a shame!

623
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:26,330
What? - That I didn't meet
you before the war. Oh, yes.

624
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,006
I woulda got you to Rome in 2 hours,
to the top of the world with my sports car.

625
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:34,677
Eh, Miss,
I wasn't always a tram driver.

626
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:38,412
A private chauffeur for the best
families in Rome. - Really?

627
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:42,513
During that time, we were always at
the Riviera, Bordighera, San Remo...

628
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:46,020
And abroad too: Cannes, Juan-Les-Pins...
- Lovely places?

629
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:50,360
What hotels! What women!
- Beautiful? - Fantastic.

630
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,517
But none like you.
- Yeah, make fun of me! - No.

631
00:48:54,748 --> 00:49:00,054
At a certain point a man like myself
gets tired of chic women.

632
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:03,962
And he needs somebody,
beautiful, simple like you.

633
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:07,996
Thank you, it's done.

634
00:49:09,165 --> 00:49:11,918
Tomorrow, you can get a copy.
- It was a snapshot!

635
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:15,535
Shall I rip it up? - No! It's the first
time somebody took my photo!

636
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:16,885
Rosella.

637
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:37,389
Better you leave me here. Thank you.

638
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:40,876
Where do you live?
- Over there at 71. I'll be late.

639
00:49:40,946 --> 00:49:42,626
Because of me?
- Oh, no.

640
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:45,127
For me the day was wonderful.

641
00:49:45,197 --> 00:49:49,099
I left that house.
I found a job and then...

642
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,476
You met me.
- Of course. That too.

643
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:56,268
Meet again tonight?
- No, I can't.

644
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,530
Why would you want to see me?
- C'mon, Rosella, what a question!

645
00:50:00,722 --> 00:50:05,996
I still got many things to tell you.
Tonight at 9. OK? Agreed? Thanks.

646
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:10,770
By the way, if you see Cesare...
don't say we met. - But he sent you!

647
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,839
Yeah, I know, but... don't tell
him we spent so much time together.

648
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,702
Oh, Mr. Cesare!
- A strange guy.

649
00:50:16,772 --> 00:50:20,000
Not that there was anything wrong
but better not to tell him.

650
00:50:20,293 --> 00:50:23,008
Then at 9? OK? Goodbye.

651
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,237
Mr. Cesare!
Mr. Cesare!

652
00:50:33,716 --> 00:50:36,532
Mr. Cesare!
- Oh, God! What is it?

653
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:38,643
What time is it?
- It's 9.

654
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:43,369
In the day?
- Yes. 9 o' clock! - Oh, God!

655
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,521
I'm ruined! What time do I begin?
- You're asking me?

656
00:50:47,818 --> 00:50:51,348
Why didn't you wake me?
- You've a short memory, Mr. Cesare.

657
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:56,076
I didn't want to enter this room again
but I was afraid you were sick.

658
00:50:56,874 --> 00:51:01,873
How long did I sleep? - You were so tired.
Not even the energy to undress yourself.

659
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:04,549
I'm ruined!
Ruined!

660
00:51:04,805 --> 00:51:09,785
Cesare, harken! - For God's sake, Ma'am,
don't preach or speak of Mr. Alfonso!

661
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:14,590
I gotta go to the depot. No time to lose.
- Cesare! Why do you speak to me so?

662
00:51:16,045 --> 00:51:17,540
And how should I speak?

663
00:51:18,524 --> 00:51:22,297
Don't you understand?
Cesare... I...

664
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:24,021
Oh, God!

665
00:51:26,188 --> 00:51:27,896
How can I? I gotta go.

666
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:32,636
I'm ruined!
I won't be just fined but fired!

667
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:35,702
I'm ruined!

668
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,903
Alfonso, have no worries about me.

669
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:45,387
What? No?

670
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,708
Mondani!
Where are you going so fast?

671
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,754
Taking my shift.

672
00:51:58,006 --> 00:52:02,492
It's 9:30. Your turn is at 11.
An hour and a half early!

673
00:52:02,562 --> 00:52:03,995
Never on time.

674
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:08,753
"The apple does not
fall far from the tree."

675
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,594
Hey! Gimme a light.

676
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,353
I got here an hour and a half early.

677
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,532
Will you stop playing these stupid jokes?

678
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:35,259
A fine friend you are! - Why?
- Yesterday, you shoulda whistled for me.

679
00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:38,696
I did come.
I was whistling for an hour! Damn!

680
00:52:39,276 --> 00:52:43,832
How sleepy I was!
I slept til this morning and that girl...

681
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:44,935
Mr. Cesare!

682
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,978
Hey, whatever he says, play along, OK?
- Don't worry.

683
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:54,990
My dear Cesare! I've been running around
all of Rome but I finally found you, eh?

684
00:52:55,243 --> 00:53:00,710
How lovely! - Have you heard? - What?
- Teresa got Rosella a job at the Rex.

685
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,665
The two girls hit it off and
Teresa has her stay at her place.

686
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,047
Thank goodness! - Yes, but you
can show up once in a while, no?

687
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:10,095
For good reasons. He was asleep
for 2 days. - Some sleep! Why?

688
00:53:10,222 --> 00:53:13,387
For two days, yes, I haven't slept!

689
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:19,460
Coworkers? - Bellini. - A pleasure.
Bellini? Bellini? I've heard that name.

690
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,787
Sorry, I confused him with Rossini!

691
00:53:21,857 --> 00:53:25,653
See, Cesare, the 15th is the great day!
We're still on for Saturday, eh?

692
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:29,136
But on Saturday...
- No, no! We're agreed. No compliments!

693
00:53:29,304 --> 00:53:32,038
But it ain't...damn my eyes if... go figure!

694
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,970
I've being trained on Saturday.
He's the teacher. - Teacher? C'mon!

695
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:42,187
For an hour and a half. If I don't go,
I'll be fired. - Fired? Just a little fine!

696
00:53:42,257 --> 00:53:44,749
The fine is expensive.
- Oh, yes: 3 lire.

697
00:53:45,408 --> 00:53:48,242
Just 3 lire! Let's go!

698
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:51,877
But... I got it! I got it!
Now I remember...

699
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:54,996
Oh, good heavens, I can't go.
I can't.

700
00:53:55,143 --> 00:53:58,675
I have a concert after work.
- What do you have to do with a concert?

701
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:01,140
He's a musician. - Him?
What do you play, my dear?

702
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,511
The bass drum.

703
00:54:03,857 --> 00:54:08,462
The timpani. - Bravo, Godfather!
I love timpani when they keep that beat!

704
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:12,238
You'll gimme some tickets, right?
- Oh, heavens, the public isn't admitted.

705
00:54:12,308 --> 00:54:17,315
Only families allowed, right?
- No! Just ask the boss. He'll be happy to.

706
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:21,215
Once he brought 14 people.
Was it 14 or 16? - 2000!

707
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,735
Then we'll be 1, 2, 3, 4 and
Rosella 5. A good number 5!

708
00:54:24,805 --> 00:54:27,251
Look, Mr. Pandolin...
- Pandolin! Godfather!

709
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:32,312
Godfather, you can't. - C'mon, Cesare,
you're rude. What'll godfather think?

710
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:34,949
I'm shocked! - But...
- We're agreed then?

711
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:37,395
Whatcha doing on the 15th?
- Me? - Nothing. - He's free!

712
00:54:37,465 --> 00:54:40,549
You'll be with us. Long live the tram!
You'll be with us.

713
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,750
A modest little party but
after all it's my first born!

714
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,205
After so many years married,
we were losing hope.

715
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:52,296
But God sent me Cesare. I mean
2 Cesares: Lil' Cesare and Big Cesare!

716
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:55,355
Rosella's waiting tonight at the Rex.
Bye, goddad!

717
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,022
Mr. Rossini, goodbye!

718
00:55:08,248 --> 00:55:09,755
Whatcha doin?

719
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:15,178
Waxing wroth...
- Mondani! Here!

720
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:18,404
We were playing.
- None of that!

721
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,748
Hey, what time do you get off tonight?
- I get off at 9.

722
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:28,141
You get off at 8. - Thanks.
- Yes, but we'll be rehearsing.

723
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:32,020
Again? - Yes, again.
It's your fault I'm doing it.

724
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:36,101
The 15th is the concert, right?
- But we always play the same thing.

725
00:55:36,242 --> 00:55:39,370
"He who want to be happy, be so.
Tomorrow brings no certainty."

726
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,876
Which means don't put off tomorrow
what you can do today.

727
00:55:42,946 --> 00:55:46,682
And as for you today is always tomorrow,
tonight we rehearse.

728
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:53,262
"The more one knows, the less one knows."

729
00:55:56,986 --> 00:56:02,567
What a bore! Tonight, I was going to
that poor girl. Bet he did it on purpose!

730
00:56:02,637 --> 00:56:04,761
Want me to go?
- You won't go.

731
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:09,766
C'mon, this time I'm not joking.
I can bring her to the rehearsal.

732
00:56:09,836 --> 00:56:12,830
Wow, that'd be doing me favor.
- Count on me.

733
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,179
Halt!

734
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:46,485
Eh, Mondani! Mondani! Will you keep up?
- I was anticipating...

735
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,778
By how many beats?
- How should I know?

736
00:56:51,063 --> 00:56:55,318
Fine! I made a mistake! - That's just
what I wanted to hear "I made a mistake"!

737
00:56:55,388 --> 00:56:59,205
Anyone can make a mistake.
"To err is human".

738
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:03,923
The wrong is not realizing it!
How can you correct it if you don't?

739
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:08,824
What's right isn't right 'til I like it!
And I like you to realize your errors!

740
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:14,110
Now then... you're behind by 6 1/2 beats!
Got it? 6 1/2 beats! No big whoops!

741
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,920
Music is not a tram
that can makeup for being late.

742
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:22,670
And even Mondani should know that.
Being late is his specialty.

743
00:57:23,017 --> 00:57:27,513
Where were we then?
You must keep ahead of the sol.

744
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,536
Then enters the clarinet.

745
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:32,098
Mi, sol, fa, la, sol, do!

746
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:35,984
Mi, Si, fa, la, mi, la!
Mi, Si, fa, la, fa, la! Like that!

747
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:38,206
Play on the mi, Si, fa, la, fa, la!

748
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:41,036
But you're doing it on
the mi, Si, fa, la, mi, la! Got it?

749
00:57:41,462 --> 00:57:45,798
Watch out, Mondani, 'cause if not,
"Better alone than in bad company".

750
00:57:45,868 --> 00:57:50,118
Now let's begin again.
Rather three beats before the 3 F.

751
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:53,024
Rather, a beat before the M!

752
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:01,515
It's our fault.
- Better leave or we'll mess him up.

753
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:03,535
Yes, Bruno.
- I'll stay here.

754
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:00,423
Where are we going?
- I'll show you the gym.

755
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:09,001
Come.
We'll turn on the light.

756
00:59:12,564 --> 00:59:15,079
Where's the switch?
- One moment.

757
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:22,695
Rosella!
Can you see me?

758
00:59:24,747 --> 00:59:26,632
Yes! I see you!

759
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:33,682
Watch this, eh? I'll do two swings.
I won the championship.

760
00:59:55,564 --> 00:59:56,870
Bruno!

761
00:59:59,825 --> 01:00:02,878
Are you hurt?
- It's nothing.

762
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:04,702
I was so scared.

763
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,831
We should call somebody.
- No, stay. It's passing.

764
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,932
Let's sit here.
- Ah, of course.

765
01:00:18,075 --> 01:00:19,671
There. Next to me.

766
01:00:20,472 --> 01:00:23,488
Is that better?
- Yes, fine.

767
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,604
My pain is here.

768
01:00:28,769 --> 01:00:30,365
I said the pain is here.

769
01:00:34,057 --> 01:00:35,108
Rosella.

770
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:54,078
Don't go. - The rehearsal must
be over. It's better to go.

771
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:56,026
Hear that?

772
01:00:57,082 --> 01:01:02,736
When I said I never met anyone like you...
- I thought you were joking but...

773
01:01:02,937 --> 01:01:05,446
But?
- It made me so happy.

774
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:10,169
So after the rehearsal,
you'll return home with Teresa.

775
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,345
But we'll see each other later. Alone.

776
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:17,471
At 10:30 or later, you'll come down.

777
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:21,971
How can I? - Can't you do what you like?
- Yes, but... - Well then?

778
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,354
I'll wait at the gate
then we'll go to my place.

779
01:01:25,706 --> 01:01:29,518
My room has an entrance on the stairs.
It's better furnished than Cesare's.

780
01:01:29,588 --> 01:01:33,315
Bruno! - What is it?
Why do you look at me like that?

781
01:01:34,515 --> 01:01:37,713
Let me go.
I should've known it!

782
01:01:38,207 --> 01:01:41,204
I beg your pardon, maybe I shouldn't
have asked you. - Let me go!

783
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:47,292
Fine, I said sorry. But you had...
had gone in Cesare's room!

784
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:55,340
Mr. Cesare!
- What is it? What?

785
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:59,173
I'm glad to see you.
- You scared me!

786
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:02,055
How cute you look tonight!

787
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:07,230
Bravo, Mr. Cesare! What lovely music!
- Thanks. I didn't write it though, eh!

788
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,282
Bravo to you for what
you've done for Rosella.

789
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:13,477
See? I kept my promise.
- What promise?

790
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:17,107
That I'd bring you here to our Cesare.
He wouldn't believe me.

791
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:23,589
He must not trust you very much.
- No, joking aside, Bruno is a true pal.

792
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:27,025
Shall we go?
- Yes.

793
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,122
"Volo". You respond, "Volo".
- Volo.

794
01:03:09,882 --> 01:03:13,750
He sleeps blessed by God.

795
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,982
Now he's a Christian too.

796
01:03:16,052 --> 01:03:19,355
Congratulations.
- Thank you, father. - Thank you.

797
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:22,332
What a treasure!

798
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,553
Father!
Allow me.

799
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:37,088
For the poor of the parish.
- Thank you and may heaven help you.

800
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:41,823
I'll see you soon.
- Another baptism?

801
01:03:41,893 --> 01:03:44,989
No.
A marriage.

802
01:03:49,419 --> 01:03:52,972
The cake!
- The boy didn't know who sent it.

803
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:57,076
Nice! Very nice! Cream and chocolate?
- What? It's candied apple!

804
01:03:57,146 --> 01:03:59,138
Good!
- I just love that!

805
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,438
We need a small glass! Get me a cup!
- Let's go to Cesarino's. Dont move.

806
01:04:06,508 --> 01:04:08,840
Get her a cup.
And the cake after the concert!

807
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,556
Oh, what a pity!

808
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:28,150
Rosella, you haven't
even looked at me once.

809
01:04:29,086 --> 01:04:31,351
You really don't want to look at me, eh?

810
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:35,946
Wait a moment. Do I annoy you?
- Please, Bruno, let me go.

811
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:41,982
Listen. If I went away, far away,
would you mind?

812
01:04:45,478 --> 01:04:46,892
Answer me!

813
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:50,414
I've met many girls and not one
acted like you. Who d'ya think you are?

814
01:04:50,484 --> 01:04:52,103
You're hurting me.

815
01:04:52,532 --> 01:04:54,165
How delicate you are.

816
01:04:56,952 --> 01:05:01,138
I can't take it! He showed me his album,
all his family photos,

817
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:03,991
him at three months, his first communion...

818
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:09,590
What's the matter?
- Nothing.  I don't feel so well.

819
01:05:09,766 --> 01:05:12,657
She has a bit of a headache.
She was just saying so earlier.

820
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:16,940
Headache? Would you like a sedative?
- It's no big deal.

821
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:20,994
It'll do you good. There's a pharmacy
below. - Don't worry, Mr. Cesare.

822
01:05:21,064 --> 01:05:24,073
I'll just be a sec. You'll see
it'll go quick. Back in a jiffy!

823
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:51,367
Why are you so mean to me?

824
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:15,981
Who is it?
- Cesare.

825
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,523
Come in.

826
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:25,390
Wasn't I quick? Here it is.

827
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:29,534
How do you feel?
- Better.

828
01:06:32,396 --> 01:06:35,390
Were you crying?
- No, I've a chill.

829
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:41,614
Of course with these thin dresses,
it takes nothing to get sick.

830
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:49,213
You're not hot.
I always get a chill too. Don't be scared.

831
01:06:49,283 --> 01:06:52,531
Take this.
Oh, yeah, the water!

832
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:55,612
Where?
Ah, there.

833
01:06:55,876 --> 01:06:59,880
You'll see. It'll all be gone
in 5 minutes. All of it.

834
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:04,590
Go on.

835
01:07:05,782 --> 01:07:10,636
How good you are, Mr. Cesare. - Well?
Why would you say something like that?

836
01:07:11,558 --> 01:07:16,938
You've done so much for me.
You are the kindest man in the world.

837
01:07:17,284 --> 01:07:21,088
Yeah, I'll win a prize!
Just for going downstairs.

838
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,198
I like going up and down stairs!

839
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:31,230
Even when you were grouchy,
I knew you were so kind.

840
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:37,132
You must forgive me if sometimes
I wasn't nice to you.

841
01:07:37,202 --> 01:07:39,229
Oh! You're not capable of it!

842
01:07:40,637 --> 01:07:44,685
You're so young!
- Who knows if you weren't there...

843
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:50,965
I feel so calm near you.
- Listen, Rosella. I...

844
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,601
You see, it's the first time that I...

845
01:07:59,048 --> 01:08:05,684
I don't know how to say it.
It's that... you... me...

846
01:08:06,796 --> 01:08:11,367
Rosella, not ready yet? It's late.
Will there be many people? - Where?

847
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:16,147
Where? Aren't you bringing her to
the concert? - Ah, right. How dumb! - Yes.

848
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,473
We must hurry.
- Right. - Right.

849
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,148
Excuse me, I'll leave you alone.
Excuse me.

850
01:08:26,704 --> 01:08:30,783
Excuse me. How stupid!
Yeah.

851
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,445
Rosella, aren't you dressing?

852
01:09:08,997 --> 01:09:12,838
Did you go to the pharmacy already?
- It's just below.

853
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:17,821
Did she take the sedative?

854
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:30,137
What?
- Want to bet? - What?

855
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:36,549
That within six months...
I'll be married.

856
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:40,372
Really?

857
01:09:41,862 --> 01:09:43,914
I'll make another bet.

858
01:09:44,344 --> 01:09:48,692
That within a year,
two little things will sprout from here.

859
01:09:51,294 --> 01:09:54,435
If you knew who she was, you wouldn't
speak so. - Who is she? A fairy?

860
01:09:54,505 --> 01:09:57,533
An angel.
It's Rosella.

861
01:10:07,186 --> 01:10:09,025
Anymore bets?

862
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:14,544
Poor Cesare.
I won't bet anymore 'cause I pity you.

863
01:10:16,123 --> 01:10:17,310
Why?

864
01:10:21,544 --> 01:10:23,921
She found the right guy for her.

865
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:27,529
That would be me?
- Yeah.

866
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:32,616
I'd be happy if you don't joke about this.
- I'm not joking, I'm serious.

867
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:36,474
You can't be serious.
You're a clown. - Oh, yeah?

868
01:10:36,544 --> 01:10:39,535
I'll double the bet and
get paid in advance! - Take it!

869
01:10:39,765 --> 01:10:43,149
Cesare!
Cesare! Goddad! Come here!

870
01:10:43,296 --> 01:10:45,787
Look at these ties.
Which do you prefer?

871
01:10:46,182 --> 01:10:49,316
This one? Good, goddad, come with me.

872
01:10:49,386 --> 01:10:51,618
I wanta make him look good today.

873
01:10:51,688 --> 01:10:56,112
I'm not sure if I'll put on you a double
breasted jacket or not. Come! Come!

874
01:11:07,544 --> 01:11:12,292
Mr. Bruno, aren't you coming with us?
- No, no. I'm working.

875
01:11:12,362 --> 01:11:14,591
What a pity.
- Yeah.

876
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:18,946
Where's Miss Rosella?
- In her room. She must be almost ready.

877
01:11:21,367 --> 01:11:24,333
Rosella, Mr. Bruno wants to say goodbye.

878
01:11:44,358 --> 01:11:46,967
Don't be afraid, I'm leaving.

879
01:11:47,272 --> 01:11:51,328
I wanted to tell you something:
I've always had fun with women,

880
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:55,471
but it never became serious.
And now I realize I did right.

881
01:11:55,819 --> 01:12:00,209
Not 'cause you're prettier than the rest,
you see, but this time I thought...

882
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:03,119
rather I was sure:
I loved you.

883
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:05,894
For real.

884
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:10,981
Well, that's done. But it had been better
if you told me that you and Cesare...

885
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:12,468
No!

886
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,705
It doesn't matter anymore.
We won't see each other for a long time.

887
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:28,492
Bruno!

888
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:34,528
Goodbye, Mr. Bruno.
- Yes, goodbye.

889
01:12:57,595 --> 01:13:01,809
Rosella! What? Aren't you ready?
- Yes, I'm coming.

890
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:09,070
Mr. Bruno is a strange guy.
First he looked happy then such a face...

891
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:10,994
Oh, finally!

892
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:15,530
See you after the concert. Watch
the little one. - Don't worry, have fun!

893
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,314
Thanks, Cecilia. I'll have fun!

894
01:13:17,384 --> 01:13:20,256
I had words with Bruno.
I must speak with you but not here.

895
01:13:20,326 --> 01:13:23,811
I'll wait for you tomorrow
at 10:30 near the San Pietro line.

896
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,618
"I'll double the bet!"

897
01:13:42,491 --> 01:13:47,874
Bravo! Bravo, Godfather! He deserves it:
Always off the beat! Syncopation is hard!

898
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,713
Go on! You can go in!
You already know the way.

899
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:28,730
Come in.

900
01:15:48,724 --> 01:15:53,053
It's me. Yesterday I received the card:
I'm driving a tank.

901
01:15:53,342 --> 01:15:55,494
I'm leaving today for Naples.

902
01:15:55,846 --> 01:16:01,378
And the... embarkation day is unknown,
but I think it'll be about a month.

903
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,898
I got lucky.
I like the heat and over there...

904
01:16:07,565 --> 01:16:12,407
This morning, I was in the barracks.
Everybody had somebody to say bye to.

905
01:16:13,543 --> 01:16:16,202
But me... oh, well.

906
01:16:16,635 --> 01:16:20,101
It's my fault. I don't know
how to make anybody love me.

907
01:16:25,078 --> 01:16:26,878
Did you write your mama?

908
01:16:26,948 --> 01:16:31,067
Why wait when you can do it?
Come here. Sit down.

909
01:16:31,191 --> 01:16:33,794
Take this. Here's paper.

910
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:37,197
Here's the pen. Write.

911
01:16:38,524 --> 01:16:39,919
"Dear Mama..."

912
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:43,074
You got a mama
and you say nobody loves you!

913
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,219
Did you write it?

914
01:16:51,372 --> 01:16:53,180
"I'm leaving for Naples."

915
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:56,891
"I'm a tank driver."

916
01:16:58,643 --> 01:17:00,764
"But don't worry, I'll be back soon."

917
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:05,886
"Right now as I write,"

918
01:17:08,585 --> 01:17:11,757
"I'm with all my friends who love me,"

919
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:13,640
Comma.

920
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:17,771
"I depart cheerfully."

921
01:17:22,148 --> 01:17:24,582
"If you need anything,"

922
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:32,980
"write to Cesare Montani,
Via Del Pellegrino 58, Rome."

923
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,362
"He's like a brother to me!"

924
01:17:37,683 --> 01:17:39,147
Exclamation point.

925
01:17:39,687 --> 01:17:42,333
What am I? The schoolteacher?

926
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,295
Well? Is it done?

927
01:17:57,524 --> 01:17:59,476
You really wrote all my words?

928
01:17:59,835 --> 01:18:02,582
Well, put your salutations.
- You write them.

929
01:18:09,676 --> 01:18:13,124
Did you really believe
what you told me yesterday?

930
01:18:17,048 --> 01:18:18,643
Why did you say that?

931
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:23,819
Because I never met an honest girl
and couldn't tell the difference.

932
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,852
So no more bets?
- No! I sure don't want to lose!

933
01:18:29,799 --> 01:18:31,795
Well, now for the address. Go on.

934
01:18:32,818 --> 01:18:38,586
You're one of those who write letters
and forgets to post them.

935
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,683
I'm sorry to leave like this.

936
01:18:46,432 --> 01:18:47,559
Gimme a light.

937
01:18:56,408 --> 01:18:59,067
Wax wro.. oth!

938
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:33,431
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

939
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:38,213
See this morning Bruno came
to my place... noooo... to say goodbye.

940
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:41,590
He's a naughty boy
but he's not bad at heart.

941
01:19:42,966 --> 01:19:45,569
I'm sure when he gets back...

942
01:19:47,795 --> 01:19:49,664
Where is he going?

943
01:19:50,526 --> 01:19:52,096
Naples.

944
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:54,699
Then to Africa.

945
01:19:56,468 --> 01:19:58,252
He'll be a tank driver.

946
01:20:03,005 --> 01:20:04,563
Excuse me.

947
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,685
Wanta see him?

948
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:35,597
Piero, we needta go!
- So soon? There's a good 5 minutes left.

949
01:20:35,795 --> 01:20:38,958
You're off!
We needta go. Let's go!

950
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,158
Hey, move it!

951
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:48,733
Well! I'm going if not that guy...

952
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:59,607
Piero! We needta be at the station by 11.
- Are you crazy?

953
01:20:59,677 --> 01:21:03,327
I'm not. Hurry. - It's 10 minutes before
departure. The arrival is for 11:10.

954
01:21:03,397 --> 01:21:07,127
Hurry! There's a guy who owes me
a 1000 lire that I don't wanna lose.

955
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:12,031
Who? - I know him. - And then?
- 500 for you if we hurry!

956
01:22:02,906 --> 01:22:05,215
Go, Piero!
- We need to stop!

957
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:06,805
OK, but just for a second!

958
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:10,313
Let's go! No time to lose!

959
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:14,235
Dicky! Dicky, hurry up!

960
01:22:14,632 --> 01:22:16,478
Hurry!
- Dicky!

961
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,751
Hands off! What manners are these?

962
01:22:20,713 --> 01:22:23,810
Gemma! Gemma!
- My husband was left alone!

963
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,797
Maybe he'll be happy now.
- What?

964
01:22:25,867 --> 01:22:30,215
We can't stop so get off! Go on, get off!
- Get off? Get off, my foot!

965
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:34,374
You do what you like!
Louts! Boors!

966
01:22:34,652 --> 01:22:40,483
Insane! They close the doors without
looking! But I'll complain, understand!

967
01:22:40,553 --> 01:22:42,907
Ah, sure.
- Then I get threatened!

968
01:22:42,977 --> 01:22:45,185
What kind of braking is that?

969
01:22:45,255 --> 01:22:50,475
Excuse me. Excuse me!
One moment. One moment!

970
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:53,315
Hey, I say, usher, is this a joke?

971
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:55,997
If you keep talking, you'll never get off!

972
01:22:57,156 --> 01:23:00,972
Won't you give me my change?
- Here. She's driving me crazy.

973
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:05,433
I only gave you 2 lire. - Here.
- Thanks. - Moving forward?

974
01:23:05,503 --> 01:23:07,842
Oh, I swear this isn't the end!

975
01:23:07,912 --> 01:23:11,813
I will complain.
Just wait! Riffraff!

976
01:23:15,368 --> 01:23:18,640
What? - Ticket.
- Ah, move ahead, please.

977
01:23:19,089 --> 01:23:21,798
I gave you 5 lire.
- So? - Gimme my change!

978
01:23:21,868 --> 01:23:23,507
Faster!

979
01:23:23,683 --> 01:23:26,392
Say, what time is it?
- Give me my 25 lire!

980
01:23:26,462 --> 01:23:29,013
Have  any change? - No!
- Pay tomorrow. Go away.

981
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:31,404
The time?
- 3 to 11.

982
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:34,589
It's 3 to 11! Got it?
- Got it.

983
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,516
Why are you stopping?
- It's red.

984
01:23:45,706 --> 01:23:47,370
One for the 70!

985
01:23:51,938 --> 01:23:54,096
Still red. It's still red.

986
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,700
Whadya want?
- The traffic light put a spell on him!

987
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:01,276
There.
It's green.

988
01:24:05,688 --> 01:24:09,115
I thought you had a pass.
- No, a ticket. - Hey, don't push!

989
01:24:09,185 --> 01:24:11,232
Watch out!
- Are we in a rush?

990
01:24:11,302 --> 01:24:14,166
I wish! We'll never get there.
You can't rush with this bus!

991
01:24:14,236 --> 01:24:18,545
Some service! I'll never take it again!
What time is it - It's past 11.

992
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:56,032
Hey, Piero, I'll be right back.

993
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:36,539
He must be here.

994
01:25:44,218 --> 01:25:45,720
There he is!

995
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:50,610
Bruno!

996
01:25:52,821 --> 01:25:55,887
Now say nobody loves you. Here.

997
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:09,796
Well, I must go.
I'll say goodbye even if I get fined!

998
01:26:09,866 --> 01:26:10,892
Bye, eh!

999
01:26:14,683 --> 01:26:16,910
Rosella.
- Bruno.

1000
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:35,157
Usher, a ticket! For the 70.

1001
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,423
Well?

1002
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:42,180
Who is smoking?
- Smoking? What an exaggeration!

1003
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:45,063
One can't even hold
an unlit cigar in his mouth!

1004
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:50,626
I'll take it out, OK? But you do your
best to exhaust the public's patience!

1005
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:57,234
Then wax wroth!
- What? What? Think you're funny?

1006
01:26:57,304 --> 01:27:01,754
Ah, you must be patient.
Even they can make a mistake.

1007
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:03,526
Up ahead!

1008
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:08,057
There's room up ahead.
Up ahead!

1009
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:28,860
