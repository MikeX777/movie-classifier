to everybody out in the
beautiful US of A tonight.

00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:22,006
How about some tunes
for those barbecues?

00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:22,940
All right.

9
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:27,611
Oh yeah, I'm having the
best Fourth of July ever.

00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:30,680
Driving through these
dark ass woods all alone.

I'm lost and out of my element
and I get scared easily.

[Marcus] Okay,
it's cold in here

54
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,888
but it's like 100
degrees outside.

55
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,756
Would you guys rather freeze
to death or burn to death?

56
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:27,724
[Mary] If I say burn to death,
will you turn the AC down?

57
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,693
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

the car's stuck.

60
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,135
Okay, can we at least
get some fresh air?

61
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:42,773
I already feel
the sweat coming on.

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,775
- Ooh.
- Get away from me.

63
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,744
All right, I should
probably go check the tire.

64
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,152
Oh my gosh, did you see
this photo Nate just posted?

65
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,022
Yeah, "Guns out, fun's out."

66
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,657
He's such an idiot.

67
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,726
Hey, come on now,
he's your brother.

68
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:04,261
Half-brother,
he's your boyfriend.

69
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:07,098
I thought you were doing better?

70
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,901
Yeah, I mean it's
not bad, it's just not-

71
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:14,105
- Great, I think the tires
are stuck on both sides.

72
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:19,777
Let me check the tail light.

73
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,146
The tail light?

74
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,648
Look, I shouldn't
have said anything.

75
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,852
Nate promised me that he
was gonna behave tonight.

76
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:29,220
So we're just gonna have fun.

77
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,722
Right Angela, fun?

00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:35,860

on Nate's picture.

People are even stupider than-

80
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:39,864
- I thought we agreed
no phones on this trip?

81
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,232
- No, we didn't.
- No.

82
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,299
- We didn't?
- No.

83
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,736
Oh god, well then who did
I make that agreement with?

84
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:47,537
I don't know.

85
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,175
That's weird.

86
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:52,910
Okay anyways, listen,

87
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:56,914
let me check under the car.

88
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,151
Okay, so what's the plan?

89
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,685
A couple of drinks
or college drunk?

90
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:05,056
Ooh, college drunk.

91
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,257
[Angela] All right.

92
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:08,125
All right.

93

All right chitters,
enough chatting or whatever.

94
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,029
Let's give this thing a shot.

95
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:13,998
I'm gonna go ahead and
step on the gas here.

96
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,900
Angela, you use your
little hand and go

97
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,202
from blue to red on the AC
thing there or whatever.

98
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:19,303
Mary-

99
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,771
- Okay, why don't I just get out

100
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,239
and push while you rev the gas?

101
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:24,942
I hadn't thought of that.

102
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,178
See, that's why they
pay you the big bucks.

103
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,979
I know.

104
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,916
Up, up and away.

meats, all the meats

117
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:33,244
This place is a lot
creepier than I remember.

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,946
What's so creepy
about it out here?

119
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,781
Is it the fact that
we're two miles

120
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:39,183
away from the closest neighbor?

121
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,919
Or what about the fact
that the only road

122
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,654
in and out is a winding
gravelly nightmare?

123
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,391
Or is it that
redneck gas station

124
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,927
attendant that told us
not to come out here?

125
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:52,963
- Or is it the-
- Hey, uh, Marcus?

126
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,332
Why do you have a small arsenal
in the back of your car?

127
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,135
Oh, Nate wanted me to
bring some fireworks.

128
00:06:58,202 --> 00:06:59,970
Aren't fireworks
illegal out here?

129
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:02,206
Yeah, because they're
super dangerous.

130
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:03,274
Yeah.

131
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,809
Illegal, dangerous.

132
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,311
What about dope as fuck?

133
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:10,948
[mid tempo dance music]

134
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,250
Okay, fine.

135
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:16,353
I'll only bring the ones with
labels written in English.

136
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,888
Buzzkill.

138
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,262
Hello?

139
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,190
Yo.

140
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:56,260
One if by land, two if by sea.

141
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:58,395
You fuckers are here
to party with me.

142
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,334
I didn't even hear
you guys come in.

143
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,935
You could be getting
murdered up here,

144
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:06,870
I'd never know the difference.

145
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,105
[Angela] I guess it's
good that we weren't then.

146
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,175
[Nate and Mary] Babe.

147
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:14,178
Stop, stop, stop,
the sun's still up.

148
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:18,148
Hey listen, so I brought
that sexy Uncle Sam costume.

149
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,251
[Mary] Oh my god, seriously,
you brought that with you?

150
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,286
[Nate] What? It's
gonna be so hot.

151
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:25,022
You're gonna be hot,
babe, you are so hot.

152
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:28,459
[Mary] Oh my god, stop
it, you're being gross.

153
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,961
I'm not doing that shit while
Ange and everybody are here.

154
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:32,997
[Nate] Oh come on,
it's the Fourth of July.

155
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:35,366
It only comes around once
a year, please, please?

156
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,001
- No.
- I want you.

157
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,138
We're not doing the sexy
Uncle Sam again, okay?

158
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,173
- It's weird that you like that.
- Hey Nate.

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,210
Hey Nate, you have any where
I can plug in my air purifier?

160
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,112
I have allergies, you know.

161
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:51,081
Yeah bro, plug it into
that power strip over there.

162
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,383
- All right.
- Yeah.

163
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,384
Knucks.

164
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,218
Careful of the beer.

165
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:04,528
Hey Mary, you want to give
me a hand outside real quick?

166
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:05,462
Yeah, sure.

167
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:22,980
Nate, I understand what
you've done with the place.

168
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:24,348
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:26,250
Thanks, thanks.

170
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,318
Yeah.

171
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:28,952
- Red, white.
- Blue.

172
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,988
- Blue.
- Yeah, it's fitting.

173
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,523
Yeah, I thought
so, I thought so.

174
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,195
Hey, I got the food
for you, by the way.

175
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,265
I tried to get the stuff that
your mom used to make for us.

176
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,300
[Angela] Yeah, it's
an honest effort.

177
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:49,440
Well hey, thanks
for coming back.

178
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,541
Yeah, of course.

179

No, I wouldn't want to miss it.

180
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,977
Cool, good.

181

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,982
And thank you too, by the way.

183

Oh, for what?

185

- Right.
- Yeah.

186

- Yeah, don't mention it.
- Cool.

187
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:13,364
Hey Nate, what happened
to all your tires?

188
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,199
- They're like shredded.
- Oh yeah.

189

That winding gravelly nightmare
road really tore 'em up.

It's definitely worse
since last time.

191

How are you gonna get home?

192
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:23,607
That sounds like a
problem for future Nate.

193
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,609
That's right,
oh, coming in hot.

194
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:28,212

- That's cool.

Jennifer's the best.

She's hilarious.

she's like "Yippie-ki-yay!"

my snake," or whatever.

Hey Nate, what
kind of beer is this?

212
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,591
This is American Bohemian,

213
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:17,361
the official beer of patriotism.

214
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:22,332
That's weird, the first
ingredient listed is Americana.

215
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,667
I mean, I guess that's more

216
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:26,069
of an idea than a
tangible ingredient.

217
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,138

just mad because it's not

four years ago.

- All right, yeah, we get it.

to my text-vitation.

I just think that if every
other country in the world

would be this jacked up cage

country's ass in a fight.

Listen Nate, I
appreciate your insight.

260
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,305
I really do but have you
taken into consideration

261
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:44,241
the countries who've existed
far longer than the US?

262

You don't really have to.

263

I'm talking about the
countries who've experienced

264
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:51,748
worse hardships because
arguably those countries would

265
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:54,786
be more hardened and thus,
more powerful in a fight.

266

00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:02,559

00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,928
Come on, man, we all want
to have a good Fourth but

357
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,998
we don't have to give ourselves
fucking alcohol poisoning.

358
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,800
Shut up.

359
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,069
Don't tell me how to
celebrate America's birthday.

360
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:06,804
I am a patriot.

361
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:08,973
You didn't even vote
in the last election.

362
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,707
[Nate] Okay, I forgot
when the election was.

363
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,509
You had an election day party.

364
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,610
[Nate] That's highly unlikely.

365
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,545
You made up a hashtag for it.

366
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:18,783
"Hashtag Nate Harmon's
election day party BYOB

367
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,618
show up at 4:00 one
guest only please."

368
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,055
Okay Nate, I just
think you're being-

369
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,489
- What, oh, you think?

370
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,525
That seems to be the only
thing you can do, Angela.

371
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:30,027
You kinda just think.

372
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:32,930
Do you think that our
forefathers thought

373
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:34,799
whenever they were
founding our great country?

374
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:36,968
[Angela] What? Yeah,
I think they did.

375
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,668
Oh, wrong.

376
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:40,872
George Washington
didn't think whenever

377
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,640
he had to fight off the
British and Abe Lincoln

378
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:47,044
didn't think whenever he
had to fight the South

379
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:51,082
and Andrew Jackson didn't
think whenever he had to fight

380
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:55,953
to be on the $20 bill.

381
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:01,125
Bro, do you even know
who Andrew Jackson was?

382
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,592
Nate, will you
just listen to me?

383
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:03,794
You're being insane right now.

384
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:08,799
Angela, can you just
meet me in the middle?

385
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,569
God, you've been shitting on
me ever since you got here.

386
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,839
First it's the beer, then
it's the dirt on the walls.

387
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:16,908
Then it's "Oh no Nate,
I fell in the toilet.

388
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:18,608
Can you please keep
the seat down?"

389
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:20,144
Okay, well this
is my cabin too.

390
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,646
Oh, this land is your land?

391
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:25,816
No, this land is my
land and I really think

392
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:28,886
you're kinda ruining
everybody's good time.

393
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:30,755
I'm ruining
everyone's good time?

394
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:33,057
You're so unpredictable,
we're all on babysitting duty

395
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:34,759
making sure you don't
blow your foot off

396
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,194
with a firework or
drink yourself blind.

397
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:41,564
Angela, you know how
important this day is.

398
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:44,101
Oh, how important this
day is to little Nathan.

399
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:46,771
Yeah, I know, we
all fucking know.

400
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,638
It's so important
because you get

401
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,841
to show everyone out
patriotic you are.

402
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:53,911
Okay.

403
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:55,046
All right.

404
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,847
You're right, you're right.

405
00:19:56,914 --> 00:19:57,815
I'm sorry.

406
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:02,652
I'm sorry that I have
a deeper understanding

407
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:05,923
of this great country
of ours than you do.

408
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,926
You know what, and I'm sorry
that I love America so much.

409
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:11,028
You don't love
America, you jackass.

410
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:12,930
You just love being
American because

411
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,032
you think it makes you
better than everyone else.

412
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,071
Wow, that's just really
good Ange, really good.

413
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,872
I think you probably
just figured me out, huh?

414
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:23,808
Yeah and you
know, dad would be

415
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,876
really disappointed in how
you're acting right now.

416
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:41,092
Did I win?

417
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:49,133
[fireworks booming]

418
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,102
Whoa, I didn't
think we'd be able

419
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,471
to hear fireworks from
all the way out here.

420
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,978
Nathan, you did not
go through dad's stuff.

421
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:05,082
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

422
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:08,886
that all men are created equal.

423
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:11,188
That they are endowed
by their Creator

424
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:16,894
with certain unalienable rights,
that among those are life,

425
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,930
liberty and the
pursuit of happiness."

426
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:23,000
Okay, cool, are
you really gonna

427
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:25,770
sit here and read me the
fucking US Constitution?

428
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:28,738
Ha, nope, it's the
Declaration of Independence.

429
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:29,907
Mark one point for Nathan.

430
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:31,708
- Okay, you know what I meant.
- Oh, did I?

431
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,943
Did I know what you meant?

432
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:37,214
[anxious violin music]

433
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:40,117
Damn, this thing's pretty long.

434
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:42,787
Uh-huh, here we go.

435
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:45,122
"We therefore, the
Representatives of the

436
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:48,893
United States of America in
General Congress assembled,

437
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,896
appealing to the Supreme
Judge of the world

438
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:56,967
for the rectitude of our
intentions, do in the name and by

439
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:00,737
authority of the good people
of these colonies solemnly

00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:04,842
publish and declare for the
support of this Declaration

441
00:22:06,277 --> 00:22:09,046
and a firm reliance on the
protection of divine Providence.

442
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:13,284
We mutually pledge to
each other our lives,

443
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,987
our fortunes and
our sacred honor."

444
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:20,057
Right there, right
fucking there,

445
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:21,926
George fucking
Washington signed it.

446
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,726
That's not George Washington.

447
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:25,229
That's John Hancock, dumbass.

448
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:35,005
Oh look, there's
George himself.

449
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:38,175
There, now he fucking did.

450
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,782
[Nate humming drunkenly]

451
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:47,084
Get the fuck away from me.

452
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:50,020
What in the United States
of fuck is your problem?

453
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:53,157
Oh my god Ange, are you okay?

454
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:57,128
[Angela grunts]

455
00:22:57,194 --> 00:22:59,196
Oh my god Ange, are you okay?

456
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:00,931
Are you okay, are you all right?

457
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,835
[ominous tones]

458
00:23:04,902 --> 00:23:06,971
[eerie whispers]

459
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,039
I hate you, I
wish you were dead.

460
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,111
Hey Angela, this
beer wasn't cheap.

461
00:23:14,178 --> 00:23:15,212
Yes it was.

462
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:18,082
Here, how much was it?

463
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,851
Five bucks, huh,
was it five bucks?

464
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:22,786
Is this is what you want?

465
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:23,787
Here.

466
00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:24,889
Yeah.

467
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:26,190
You know, actually, oh look,

468
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:28,025
it's your good buddy,
Andrew Jackson.

469
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:36,333
I don't need this.

470
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:41,005
What I need is an ice
cold American margarita.

471
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:46,377
Okay.

472
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:51,115
[electric crackling]

473
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:53,951
Jesus Christ.

474
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,421
What the fuck was that?

475
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:59,190
I thought you said you
were gonna behave tonight?

476
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:01,125
What was un-behaving
about what I did?

477
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:03,260
You owe your
sister an apology.

478
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:06,063
Half-sister and I
don't owe her anything.

479
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,865
I can do what I want,
it's a free countr...

480
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:09,934
If you say it's a free
country, I swear to God,

481
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,369
I'm breaking up with you
and hooking up with Marcus.

482
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:18,042
Apologize to her and then go
get the fucking power back on.

483
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:21,378
Babe, the breaker is
all the way downstairs

484
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:23,981
and Angela is all
the way upstairs.

485
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:27,184
What can I do for
you on this floor?

486
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:30,321
In the dark while I'm
still pissed off, nothing.

487
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:34,091
You guys are such-

488
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:35,226
- If you say pussies,
I swear to God,

489
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:37,995
I'm breaking up with
you and fucking Marcus.

490
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,067
Calm down, you talking tree.

491
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:47,737
Let's go, guess this is
a job for present Nate.

492
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,041
We'll be back, so
try not to take

493
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:53,210
Angela's side over
mine while we're gone.

494
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:55,045
Nate, you're really making me-

495
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,880
- [Nate] Oh, I'm so
sorry, I can't hear you.

496
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:57,982
I'm already in the basement.

497
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:03,287
- So are we gonna have some-
- Marcus, no.

498
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:13,264
Jesus, is it tomorrow yet?

499
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:18,035
[dramatic electronic tone]

500
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,381
What the fuck
is all this shit?

501
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,016
He couldn't put it
in his own room?

502
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:35,252
I can't believe he did
that in front of you guys.

503
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,087
He's such a fucking dick.

504
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:38,455
Yeah, I know, you're right.

505
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:40,357
And I know Nate, I
know he's gonna try

506
00:25:40,424 --> 00:25:42,526
to get back at me for ruining
his pathetic little night

507
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:44,528
and Mary and Marcus
didn't say shit.

508
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:47,498
They never defend me because
he's the fun party guy.

509
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:49,967
- Well, it's not funny anymore.
- Ange, Ange.

510
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,568
- We're not 20.
- Ange.

511
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:03,213
He hung a fucking
American flag in my room.

512
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:10,454
Here, let me give
you a shoulder massage,

513
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:12,823
kinda my trademark.

514
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:16,226
Evan, I'm not really
in the mood for,

515
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:19,830
it's your trademark?

516
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:24,535
I'm known far and
wide for my massages.

517
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,374
Oh Evan.

518
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:35,279
I don't think this is
good timing, you know?

519
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:38,148
Because I just was
fighting with Nate and-

520
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:41,418
- Come on, think about
how pissed Nate would be.

521
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:44,121
Yeah, that would really piss-

522
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,090
- Pisses me off, the
fact that she actually

523
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:48,392
thinks she's so
much smarter than me

524
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:52,129
when spoiler alert,
she's actually not.

525
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,164
Really?

526
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:59,470
Hey, but didn't she graduate
like something cum latte.

527

00:44:53,544 --> 00:44:56,346
I said "Lets say we wouldn't
have to worry about Jackson."

884
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:58,515
I don't know, it seemed
like the right thing to say.

[anxious mid tempo drumbeat]

886
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:06,023
Okay, what now?

887
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:07,224
I think we're lost.

888
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,626
You'd better be joking.

889
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:11,328
No, I really don't
know where the cabin is.

890
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:13,263
Well, it should
just be over there.

891
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,299
Well, it should be but,
wait, hold on one second.

892
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:18,235
Okay yeah, here we go.

893
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:19,336
So if trees grow
towards the north

894
00:45:19,403 --> 00:45:22,239
and moss grows fat
on the rolling stone,

895
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:23,507
then the cabin should be...

896
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:27,244
Ow.

897
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,512
- Let me look at it.
- No stop, get off.

00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:30,514

- No, let me talk to her.

- She's my girlfriend.
- No, she's my best friend.

904

- I've known her longer.
- I've known her longer.

905
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:41,258
- Have you kissed her?
- Yes.

- What?
- What?

907
00:45:45,295 --> 00:45:46,730
- Nate, are you there?

I think it got Nate and Ange.

915
00:46:10,454 --> 00:46:12,289
What about Evan?

916
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:15,158
I tried calling but it
went straight to voicemail.

917

Oh Evan, that's who I made

918

be us out here now.

he'd be the last

930
00:46:46,323 --> 00:46:48,625
Maybe we should call the police.

931
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,194
Yeah right, the police,
let's call the police.

932

for the police?

to die, Marcus.

00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:40,677
You don't know that, okay?

1059
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,080
The car's gone, maybe Mary and
Marcus went to go get help.

1060
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:47,617
They'll never make it outta
here and neither will we.

1061
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:48,953
I killed Mary,

1062
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,055
I killed Marcus,

1063
00:52:51,122 --> 00:52:52,622
I killed us.

1064
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:58,062
If you feel so fucking
bad, come and help me.

1065
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,565
That can't be good.

1066
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:04,902
Nate, come on, we gotta
get out of here, come on.

1067
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:07,772
What's the use? I'm no good.

1068
00:53:09,173 --> 00:53:11,741
I couldn't be there for
dad when he needed me.

1069
00:53:13,044 --> 00:53:15,712
I couldn't protect Mary
from the killer zombies.

1070
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,981
I can't protect you.

1071
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:19,884
I don't need
you to protect me.

1072
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:21,618
Right now, you need
me to protect you.

1073
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,856
Whatever has happened between us

1074
00:53:25,923 --> 00:53:27,892
in the past few years,
it's behind us now, okay?

1075
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:28,960
It doesn't matter.

1076
00:53:30,828 --> 00:53:32,863
I need you to get off your
ass and come with me, okay?

1077
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,597
We should stick together.

1078
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:39,703
Okay.

1079
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,842
A house divided-

1080
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:46,210
- Against itself cannot stand.

1081
00:53:47,211 --> 00:53:48,545
Yes.

1082
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:49,146
Come on.

1083
00:53:50,214 --> 00:53:51,782
You quoted Lincoln.

1084
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:53,951

[Nate choking]

1089
00:54:37,828 --> 00:54:39,030
Nate, run.

1090
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:46,871
My compatriot.

1091
00:54:53,077 --> 00:54:54,711
Brother.

1092
00:54:54,779 --> 00:54:55,279
Please

1093
00:54:56,746 --> 00:54:58,149
save your strength.

1094
00:55:00,017 --> 00:55:03,254
Enjoy the sweet warmth of
the land of the living.

1098
00:55:12,196 --> 00:55:13,864
Hush, my friend.

1099
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,700
Soon enough, you shall too.

1100
00:55:19,103 --> 00:55:20,004
Then

1101
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:22,173
when we have our army,

1102
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,810
nothing can stop us.

1103
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:30,014
This land

1104
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:31,182
belongs to us.

1105
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:37,888
Are you ready to take it back?

1106
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:45,162
[Washington and Lincoln
cackling maniacally]

1107
00:56:03,347 --> 00:56:05,216
Nate, your tapping your
foot is freaking me out, okay?

1108
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:07,218
Help me board up a
window or something.

1109
00:56:08,886 --> 00:56:10,754
Angela, I want to talk
to you about something

1110
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:12,123
and just a warning, it's
going to be controversial.

1111
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:14,325
Everything you say
is controversial, Nate.

1112
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,161
I don't think I can
fight off these zombies.

1113
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:18,762
Yeah, I know you can't.

1114
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:20,898
You're not very coordinated.

1115
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,968
I mean I don't think I
can bring myself to do it.

1116
00:56:26,337 --> 00:56:28,172
What's that supposed to mean?

1117
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:30,174
Look, if this were
a legion of the undead

1118
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:32,309
and they were a bunch of
anonymous Joe Schmoes,

1119
00:56:32,376 --> 00:56:34,945
I would have no
problem killing them.

1120
00:56:35,012 --> 00:56:39,250
But these, they're former
Presidents of the United States.

1121
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,790
Nate, I'm running out
of rousing speeches here.

1122
00:56:46,857 --> 00:56:49,059
No Ange, you don't get it.

1123
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:50,127
Washington, Lincoln.

1124
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:53,230
They are America.

1125
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:55,933
I mean shit, Andrew
Jackson is on the $20 bill.

1126
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,234
Is that literally
the only thing

1127
00:56:57,301 --> 00:56:59,136
you know about Andrew Jackson?

1128
00:56:59,203 --> 00:57:01,138
- I know he was a President.
- Yeah, which one?

1129
00:57:01,205 --> 00:57:02,106
What number?

1130
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:08,745
I want to say higher than
three but less than 50.

1131
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:13,284
He was the seventh and
he was a piece of shit.

1132
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,219
You can't say that
about a President.

1133
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:17,354
Have you heard of
the Trail of Tears?

1134
00:57:17,421 --> 00:57:19,023
That was Jackson.

1135
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:20,958
No, I haven't
heard of that and it

1136
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:23,160
doesn't matter what he did,
he was still the President.

1137
00:57:23,227 --> 00:57:24,828
Okay, enough Nate.

1138
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:26,764
I'm clearly not gonna
change your mind

1139
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,433
but we have to do something,
like get the power back on.

1140
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:34,838
I'm sorry, Ange, but I
really want to stay here.

1141
00:57:35,973 --> 00:57:38,275
Please stay here with me.

1142
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,146
We can sit and talk, reconnect.

1143
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,916
Look, I was wrong.

1144
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:47,885
Okay?

1145
00:57:47,952 --> 00:57:51,789
We don't need each
other and at this point,

1146
00:57:51,855 --> 00:57:54,925
I either have to leave you

1147
00:57:54,992 --> 00:57:56,060
or die with you.

1148
00:58:01,165 --> 00:58:06,036
You know why the Fourth of
July is so important to me?

1149
00:58:06,103 --> 00:58:09,073
'Cause that's the last time
I saw dad before he died.

1150
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:15,179
It was the last time the
three of us were all together.

1151
00:58:19,149 --> 00:58:21,952
That's why I wanted
tonight to be so perfect.

1152
00:58:26,957 --> 00:58:28,492
You're all I have left, Ange.

1153
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:31,295
You're my sister.

1154
00:58:33,497 --> 00:58:35,099
Half-sister.

Please know that if
you're reading this,

1168
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:14,264
it is too late for me.

1169
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:17,101
Each day, I grow weaker
and increasingly paranoid

1170
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:20,404
of the possibility of my
research into the supernatural

1173
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:26,977
[Father] I believe that
these documents which I have

1174
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:30,013
gathered were created by
ancient evil spirits made

1175
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,183
to look like significant
historical documents.

1176
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,419
These papers
function as a gateway

1177
01:00:35,486 --> 01:00:38,155
for the evil spirits
to enter our world,

1178

havoc among the living.

seems to make any sense to me

all has a logic to it

Our ambulance is stuck

1414

on the gravelly,
winding nightmare road.

1415
01:17:17,187 --> 01:17:21,125
Do you think you could walk...?

1416
01:17:21,191 --> 01:17:22,993
Uh... yeah, we'll
get you in there.

We'll get you in
there in just a sec.

1418
01:17:26,363 --> 01:17:29,366
We wanted to tell you that
this ride is gonna cost

1419
01:17:30,601 --> 01:17:34,004
$9,283.

1420
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:37,641
No, he has insurance,
so it should be covered.

1421
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:42,146
According to this, it's not.

don't do well with bad news.

I don't like delivering it

1425

but there is more bad news.

1426
01:17:51,355 --> 01:17:53,190
It looks like your insurance

1427
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:56,293
isn't gonna cover the
reattachment of your leg.

What?

1429
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:00,130
Yeah, it only covers limbs

1430
01:18:00,197 --> 01:18:03,066
that become missing
in the hospital.

1431
01:18:03,133 --> 01:18:05,402
Is that supposed to
be some kind of joke?

1432
01:18:05,469 --> 01:18:08,338
What kind of a fucked
up policy is that?

1433
01:18:08,405 --> 01:18:09,506
I mean, that's insane.
