<i>AN ACTOR PREPARES</i>

2
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,250
- Is it an accident?
- What happened?

3
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,708
- I'll go and see.
- Let's take a look.

4
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,166
- Is everything all right?
- He fainted.

5
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,166
- Hurry.
- That's not good.

6
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,166
- Sir, where are you hurting?
- It hurts.

7
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,166
- Where?
- I don't know. Everywhere.

8
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,833
- Let me help you get up.
- I can't move. It's too painful.

9
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,083
- He is here.
- Is it there?

10
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,416
Is this a scam? Is it real?

11
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,500
- Hello, is this emergency service?
- It must be fake.

12
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,958
- I'm here at Dapeng.
- Is it a scam?

13
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,041
Is it real?

14
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,083
Sir.

15
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,291
I'm also an actor.

16
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,208
Your acting is not good.

17
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,375
{\an8}The key to a scam is the feeling of pain.

18
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,791
You're not showing enough emotion.
It's not convincing enough.

19
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,291
- Gosh.
- Look at you.

20
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,875
Even your moan is so frivolous.

21
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,583
You were hit by a car.
You can't just moan like that.

22
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:38,875
Of course, you can't succeed.

23
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,958
Otherwise, the audiences
won't sympathize with you.

24
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,125
Gosh. It really hurts.

25
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,041
No, sir. Your acting is terrible.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,416
Let me show you.

27
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,375
Gosh.

28
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,708
It hurts...

29
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,041
Sir, you're doing it too fast.

30
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,375
Fainting is fine, but it has a process.

31
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,541
For example, hold onto your head...

32
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,208
The blood looks real.

33
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,500
Too bad your acting was bad
in the beginning.

34
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,833
You've already lost your credibility.

35
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,375
I'm just sharing some tips with you.

36
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,083
Don't take it personally, sir.

37
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,416
The ambulance is here.

38
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,333
- Make way.
- Make way.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,791
Mild fracture in the left chest,
third rib bone, not life-threatening.

40
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:21,708
Come on.

41
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,000
That's so serious.

42
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,083
Hurry.

43
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,791
- Ready, up.
- Up.

44
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,375
- Be careful.
- Okay.

45
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm so sorry, sir.

46
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,500
Is the lady his family member?

47
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,125
She is a lunatic. Ignore her.

48
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,416
What happened?

49
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,375
- Help.
- Help.

50
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,375
- Help!
- My leg!

51
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,333
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

52
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,541
Don't you know how to act?

53
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,541
You're in pain. Why aren't you screaming?
Do you know how to act?

54
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,375
Well, in my own experience,

55
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,916
when people are in pain,
they don't always scream out loud.

56
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,416
What the hell are you talking about?

57
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,458
Sir, please come over.

58
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,750
Could you act out a painful reaction?

59
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,416
This is fake.

60
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,708
Do me a favor.

61
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,041
This is real. There is no sound, right?

62
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,333
Please talk to the director.

63
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,208
Director, what do you think?

64
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,958
- I...
- Director?

65
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,583
You...

66
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,791
- Three.
- Three.

67
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,333
Get the hell out.

68
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:30,875
What happened?

69
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,875
- She was thrown out.
- Thrown out?

70
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,708
- What happened to her?
- Who knows.

71
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,583
- I don't know.
- What's happening?

72
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,333
- Hey!
- He is here.

73
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,125
I need an extra to play as a corpse.
You must keep the makeup on for two days.

74
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,833
- Who wants to go?
- How much?

75
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,083
It's 400 dollars for two days.

76
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,791
- Add more.
- That's too little. Add some more.

77
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,750
I'll go.

78
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,375
Can I play a role that can show my face?

79
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,666
Are you bargaining with me?

80
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,208
You don't have to pay me. A meal is fine.

81
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,833
- Okay. Let's go.
- Is she doing it for free?

82
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,208
She is crazy.

83
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,791
- Yes.
- There's something wrong with her.

84
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,916
Come on, let's eat.
The food is getting cold.

85
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,083
Gosh. It's your birthday today.

86
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,041
If you don't start eating,
no one else will.

87
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,708
Dad.

88
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,458
Happy birthday.

89
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

90
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,375
Dreamy, your makeup is very unique today.

91
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,625
It's quite terrifying.

92
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,333
Is filming fun?

93
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,333
I get to play a corpse this time.

94
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,750
There's a close-up,
so I can show my acting skills.

95
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,958
How could you even show
your acting skills by playing a corpse?

96
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:26,291
Dad, death makes
an interesting context for actors.

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,375
Imagine.

98
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,125
If you were to die now
and your whole body turns stiff...

99
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,750
What did you say?
I dare you to say it again.

100
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,250
Birthdays should be a happy occasion.

101
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,083
Dreamy, stop the nonsense.

102
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,708
Go and remove your makeup.

103
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,583
But I still have a shoot tomorrow.

104
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,583
Do you really think
you're a famous movie star?

105
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,083
You guys grew up together, right?

106
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,000
Look at Bobby.
He is now a big-time lawyer.

107
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,500
It's nothing much. Nothing to brag about.

108
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,791
And look at Peggy.
She lives a happy life now.

109
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,333
She married a good husband.

110
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,000
Look at you.

111
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,458
We'd hoped you would become a lawyer.

112
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,666
Not a corpse.

113
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,375
Everyone has their own specialty.

114
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,708
A lawyer and a corpse make no distinction.

115
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,125
I can support myself even if I'm an extra.

116
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,916
I have my own dreams too.

117
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,291
You're already 30 years old.

118
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,291
You've been an extra for over a decade.

119
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,833
Have you ever played the lead?

120
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,875
I believe that with my talents,

121
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,625
if I work hard,
I can definitely be the lead actress.

122
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:19,875
Sorry.

123
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,791
- Mom, do you believe in me?
- Yes, you can do it.

124
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,375
That's bullshit!

125
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,416
It's all your fault. You've spoiled her!

126
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,333
I'm giving you one last chance.

127
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,625
Take that thing off your head!

128
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,625
I can't.

129
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,291
Then, I'll add one more for you.

130
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,416
Here. You asked for it.

131
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,625
Wait a second.

132
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:42,750
Never mind.

133
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,000
Your emotions are so inspiring.

134
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,416
Dad, hold the cleaver and hop again.

135
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,666
I want to record this.

136
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,166
Ready, jump.

137
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,750
- You've gone too far.
- Gosh.

138
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,833
Look at her.

139
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,500
- What are you doing?
- Aunt, we'll leave now.

140
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,041
- I'm sorry.
- Get out.

141
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,583
I've never given birth to you!

142
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,041
Take your trash with you.

143
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,333
But Dad, those are all your trash.

144
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,083
I don't give a damn.

145
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,791
You total bum.

146
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,625
Get the hell out of here.

147
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,708
Enough.

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,333
Stop it.

149
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,958
It's all your fault.

150
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,291
Enough!

151
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,708
Hey!

152
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,125
Can anyone act here?

153
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,083
- Yes.
- I can.

154
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,041
Hey, you. Show me.

155
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Do a happy reaction.

156
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,791
A sad reaction.

157
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,000
All right, come with me.

158
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,750
Hey, who can do an angry look?

159
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,666
- Me.
- Me.

160
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,583
You.

161
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,833
No way. Get lost.

162
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,750
You try.

163
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,083
Okay, come along.

164
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,500
Anyone, act like you've got hit
by the ultimate power.

165
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,166
- Me.
- You try.

166
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,875
Director, can you specify
the type of the move?

167
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,500
What's with all the questions?
Get lost if you can't do it.

168
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,833
- How about Icy Palm Attack?
- Okay, Icy Palm Attack.

169
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,291
It's so cold.

170
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,791
It's freezing.

171
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,833
Go see a doctor if you're sick.
I don't want to get infected.

172
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,375
You. Try.

173
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,416
Why are you dragging me here?
I'm not going.

174
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,916
I just want to bring her some soup.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,583
You made soup for her?
Are you on her side?

176
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,250
You can just pretend
we're passing by to see her.

177
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,666
If I see her, I'm going to hit her.

178
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't stop me.

179
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,583
- Or else, I'll hit you too.
- Idiot.

180
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,916
You're asking for it.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,416
What's wrong with you?

182
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,250
Just do the acting.
Why do you need to know everything?

183
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,000
It's you every time.

184
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,083
I just want to build up my character.

185
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,750
Build my ass.

186
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,291
No one will even notice you.

187
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,916
Do you think you are the lead?

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,125
Even if I give you the context,
would you even get it?

189
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,833
If you could get it,
you won't be just an extra here.

190
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,666
Go, come with me!

191
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,000
- That was intense.
- Yes, indeed.

192
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,125
- Hello.
- What is it?

193
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,958
- Could you speak nicely?
- What?

194
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,708
The actor was just asking you a question,
why would you get mad at her?

195
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,125
What does that have to do with you?

196
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,583
She is so serious about acting.
Can't you see that?

197
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,750
- Who's that?
- You know who I'm talking about!

198
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,416
God is watching what you're doing.

199
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,708
Be careful of the karma.

200
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,666
You have some nerves.
Production assistant!

201
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,333
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,541
Let's go.

203
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,500
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,833
That's good.

205
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,250
What a lunatic.

206
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,875
Hello.

207
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,333
Your acting for Icy Palm Attack
was intensely sensational.

208
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,708
It hit the mark.

209
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,583
It was passable.

210
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,375
The key is imagination.

211
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,000
Immerse yourself into the scene.

212
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,416
That's amazing.

213
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,416
I'm Young.

214
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,750
I'm Dreamy.

215
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,625
- You're reading this book too?
- Yes.

216
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,958
Do you like "King of Comedy" too?

217
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,541
Of course. I love it so much.

218
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,833
Do you want to try acting?

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,791
- Right here?
- Sure.

220
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,416
Hey.

221
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,708
What is it?

222
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,708
Are you leaving?

223
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:04,916
Yes.

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,625
- Where are you going?
- Home.

225
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,708
- And then?
- Off to work.

226
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,916
Can you not go to work?

227
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,625
Are you going to feed me if I don't work?

228
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,208
Hey.

229
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,125
What now?

230
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,958
I'll feed you.

231
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,833
My boyfriend is here.

232
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,875
Hey, that's the wrong line.

233
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,291
No, my boyfriend is really here.

234
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,458
See you.

235
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,083
Who's that guy?

236
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,958
- A colleague.
- Really?

237
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,750
Yes. Let's go.

238
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,333
You can have my sausage.

239
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,791
Let's share it.

240
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,041
I've earned 4,000 dollars this month.

241
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,458
Let's deposit it into our wedding fund.

242
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,583
You only make 5,000 dollars
at most a month.

243
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,666
How would you survive
if you give me 4,000 dollars?

244
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,625
One thousand dollars is enough for me.

245
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,583
I have free catered meals for casts.

246
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,958
Let me contribute 4,500 dollars.
You can take 500 dollars.

247
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,833
Take it easy. We agreed to half each.

248
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,541
I thought my love for you was deeper.

249
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,875
But it turns out,
your love for me is just as deep.

250
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,833
Are you really giving him your money?

251
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:54,875
Yes.

252
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,208
Then, why don't you give it to me?

253
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,833
I'm not getting married to you.

254
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,375
You might as well be with me then.

255
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,500
- Lend me your soap.
- Okay.

256
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,333
Why do you keep staring at Mimi?
Do you like her?

257
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,125
It pisses me off when you say that.

258
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,583
Looking at her doesn't mean I like her.

259
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,750
I despise her from the bottom of my heart.

260
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,125
She is so cheap.

261
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,791
Don't you think Mimi's pretty?

262
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,125
Beauty means nothing.

263
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,458
She is just an eye candy.

264
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,833
- Do you know why I love you?
- Why?

265
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,708
Because you have good taste.

266
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,416
Of course.

267
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,166
Dear.

268
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,666
I want to introduce you to my parents.

269
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,916
They'll be so relieved
to know we are together.

270
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,416
That's for sure.

271
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,750
Actually, I've been busy
with a big project lately.

272
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,375
When I accomplish this,

273
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,833
your parents will definitely
be so proud of me.

274
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,833
Not to brag,

275
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,291
but I, Charlie, will be
the next Bill Gates.

276
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,000
You want to be number one
when you just started?

277
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,000
How about you be more realistic and go
for number two or three first?

278
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,708
I am very humble and realistic.

279
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,000
- How many eyes does Bill Gates have?
- Two.

280
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,958
- Then, how many eyes do I have?
- Two.

281
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,166
He doesn't have more
and I don't have any less.

282
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,333
- Is that right?
- Yes.

283
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,583
Whatever he can do, I'm capable of it too.

284
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,375
Absolutely right.

285
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,291
Listen to me.
You must believe you're the best.

286
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,916
You're not in the second or third place.
You are the number one.

287
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,416
Stop thinking about the web series.

288
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,666
You should go for
the international blockbuster movies.

289
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,791
Actually, an international production
is looking for Chinese actors.

290
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,708
That's your chance.

291
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,958
But they're looking for Snow White.

292
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,625
- You're Snow White.
- Me?

293
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,166
- How many eyes does Snow White have?
- Two.

294
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,958
- How many eyes do you have?
- Two.

295
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,458
So, why can't you be Snow White?

296
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,875
Tell me. Why not?

297
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,791
Tell me!

298
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,625
Don't just keep staring at me.

299
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,416
Say it!

300
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,625
Does it make sense at all?

301
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,625
You are Snow White!

302
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,166
Hey, do you really want
to get beauty injections?

303
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes, <i>Snow White</i> is a Western classic.

304
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,791
I wish to westernize my face.

305
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,291
You've even thought of that.

306
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,958
Those famous actors do it all the time.

307
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,958
Marlon Brando went all out
to get the role in <i>The Godfather</i>.

308
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,583
He took great pains with his face.

309
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,125
Bullshit. It's just an excuse
to get cosmetic surgery.

310
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,291
You guys just don't get it.

311
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,333
Getting prettier is surely a good thing.

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,250
I found an amazing beauty application.

313
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,083
SoYoung Medical Aesthetic App.

314
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,500
SOYOUNG MEDICAL AESTHETIC APP

315
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,916
It stores wholesome information
and various cases.

316
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,083
I actually know a well-known
80-year-old brand.

317
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,208
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

318
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,625
Pig liver, pig brain and pig intestine.

319
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,208
- Have a look.
- Have a look.

320
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,166
Here we are.

321
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,958
- Five hundred dollars.
- Have a look.

322
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,458
Doctor, I bring a new customer to you.

323
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,333
Fresh shrimp, come and have a look.

324
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,125
- It's fresh.
- Have a look.

325
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,833
Please come again.

326
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,250
What would you like to do?

327
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,000
I want to look like her.

328
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,500
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

329
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,166
But it's my first time,
so I'm a bit nervous.

330
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,583
It's also my first time doing this style.

331
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,041
I'm a bit nervous too.

332
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,958
You do Chinese faces more often, right?

333
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,791
Honestly, I usually do
human looks more often.

334
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,500
Do you want the hair too?

335
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,041
What hair?

336
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,041
The whole body is hairy.

337
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,416
Right. They're hairier than we are.

338
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,708
But usually, most people won't notice.

339
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,166
It's hard not to notice.

340
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,791
You're so professional.

341
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,750
But I'll just skip the hair.

342
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,250
What a shame.

343
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,875
The effect will only last for two days.

344
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,833
It's simple. It can be done quickly.

345
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,541
Doctor, I want a tall, upward nose.

346
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,791
Any more upwards and your nostrils
will be as big as a yin-yang hotpot.

347
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,583
Yin-yang hotpot?

348
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,916
Whatever, as long as you like it.

349
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,583
Doctor.

350
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,541
Why do you keep looking at that gorilla?

351
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,833
I need to look at it,
so that I'll know what to do.

352
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,583
Why?

353
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,750
You wanted this gorilla look, right?

354
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,333
No, it's not that. I wanted this.

355
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,958
Why didn't you say that earlier?

356
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,125
- I want a mirror.
- Hey.

357
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,166
Don't look. You won't be able to take it.

358
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,666
Relax, let me fix it. Just lie down.

359
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,750
All right, it's done.

360
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,041
How is it? Let me take a look...

361
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,375
What should I do now?

362
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,875
- It's gorgeous.
- How gorgeous?

363
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,750
Too gorgeous to look at.

364
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,208
It's much better now.

365
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,541

What do you want?

370
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,583
I'm here for the audition.

371
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,833
Which role?

372
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,458
Snow White.

373
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,250
Why?

374
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,166
Because I want to audition
for the role of Snow White.

375
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,750
Could you please repeat that?

376
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,125
Why should I repeat it so many times?

377
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,958
I'm not sure if I heard you right.

378
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,041
I'm here to audition for Snow White.

379
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,541
Come again.

380
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,708
Never mind, excuse me.

381
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,458
Stay there.

382
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,083
Stop that woman.

383
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,208
Don't let her go.

384
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,291
Stop her.

385
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,416
- Don't run.
- Stop her. Catch her.

386
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,375
- Don't run.
- Stop!

387
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,208
- Catch her!
- Catch her!

388
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,833
- Don't run.
- Chase her!

389
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,250
- Don't run!
- Stop!

390
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,250
- Stop!
- Catch her!

391
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,666
- Are you still running?
- Still running?

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,125
Where are you running off to?

393
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,375
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

394
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,750
I shouldn't have come.

395
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:22,958
Boss, take a look.

396
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,875
What do you think?

397
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,000
That's the one.

398
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,583
No.

399
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,541
I won't do it again.

400
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,458
- Neck, 33 inches.
- Dismiss.

401
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,666
- Get to work.
- Dismiss.

402
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,541
Sleeve, 60 inches.

403
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,208
Loosen the clothes here.

404
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,083
What's going on?

405
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,833
Don't move.

406
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,125
Please tell me what's going on.

407
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,250
You got the role.

408
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,250
What?

409
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,416
Director.

410
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,041
- We're almost ready.
- I got the role?

411
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,333
We're ready, Director.

412
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,166
<i>- If the actor is ready, come to the scene.</i>
- Okay.

413
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,958
The actors, go to the scene.

414
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,666
May I know what this scene is about?

415
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,625
Stay calm. We'll tell you after we shoot.

416
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,291
What's the character's emotional state?

417
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,541
Don't worry about it.

418
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,000
You'll find out after this. Actor, on set.

419
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,541
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

420
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,208
Okay. Stay here.

421
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,500
Next one.

422
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,875
Over there.

423
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,125
- Hurry.
- This one.

424
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,500
Don't move. Wait.

425
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,125
- Ready.
- Come here.

426
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,666
- Camera.
- That way.

427
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,875
Okay. Switch to the actor.

428
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,958
Lose the double.
Actor, ready for your lines.

429
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,666
Take her away. Hurry up.

430
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,541
Move aside.

431
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,166
I'm not afraid.

432
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,541
Beat me to death!

433
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,333
Okay. Keep going.

434
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,250
Actor, take a break. Double, take over.

435
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,916
Sir, you've worked hard.

436
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,125
Turn around.

437
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,416
- Tilt your head. Stay sharp.
- Come on. Hold up your finger.

438
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,208
Lift up your finger. Get ready to shoot.

439
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,625
Okay, face the camera.

440
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,333
Switch.

441
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,541
Action!

442
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,416
I can't believe you really killed me.

443
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,166
Wonderful.

444
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,625
The seven dwarves have finally
avenged Snow White.

445
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,375
This is so touching.

446
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,083
Director, aren't I supposed
to be Snow White?

447
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,583
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get lost.

448
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,291
- Sorry, Director.
- Sorry.

449
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,458
Director.

450
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,583
Director, sorry.

451
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,750
- Ready for Snow White's scene.
- Yes.

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,875
Mr. Marco.

453
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,291
<i>Tell that washed-up actor to hurry up.
We're waiting for him.</i>

454
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,791
Who's the washed-up actor?

455
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,458
Me.

456
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,875
Watch your mouth.

457
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,708
SNOW WHITE, BLOODBATH IN CHINATOWN

458
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,541
Make way. Mr. Marco is coming.

459
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,041
Director, please pick
the female version of Snow White.

460
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,958
Any pretty face will do.
There's only one shot.

461
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,458
Attention. Mr. Marco is here.

462
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,791
Mr. Marco is here. Make way.

463
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,416
Attention. Mr. Marco is here. Make way.

464
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,458
Get out of the way.

465
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,791
Attention. Mr. Marco is here. Make way.

466
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,708
Mr. Marco is here.

467
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,375
Mr. Marco, in this scene,
you will be playing Snow White.

468
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,791
You were set up by the evil witch.

469
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,083
You ate a poisonous banana
and then, you became a man.

470
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,541
The prince was too drunk to notice
and he slept with you.

471
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,166
- Did I do him? Or did he do me?
- Both ways.

472
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,250
When the prince woke up,
he found out you were a man.

473
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,333
He couldn't accept it,
so he tried to kill you.

474
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,166
But it ended up that you killed him.

475
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,875
The prince's men tracked you down
all the way.

476
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,625
You ran to Chinatown
and was attacked by them.

477
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,750
You were badly hurt.
Your guts came spilling out.

478
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,541
Isn't that too cruel?

479
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,458
Actually, I want to pay homage
to Zhang Che's aesthetic of violence.

480
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,416
Zhang Che, aesthetic of violence.

481
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,625
- Do you get it?
- Fine.

482
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,583
It's not that. Did you get it or not?

483
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,750
- What do you think?
- It's hard to say.

484
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,208
Of course, I get it. It's violent, right?

485
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,166
This is perfect.

486
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,583
Let's do the scene when you get stabbed
and you're angry. Okay?

487
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,875
Okay, let's begin.

488
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,166
Okay.

489
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,916
Mr. Marco, let me set up the props.

490
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,458
Camera!

491
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,333
Take one.

492
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,041
I...

493
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,666
I am so angry.

494
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,750
Mr. Marco, can you try
to look really angry?

495
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,041
I've already said I'm angry.

496
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,833
- You all heard it, right?
- Yes.

497
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,875
Director, only you
didn't hear what I said.

498
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,125
Do you think I'm lying?

499
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,833
It's hard to say.

500
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,166
Then, don't say anything.

501
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,416
No one is forcing you.

502
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,500
Can you be more girly?

503
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,125
I thought so too.

504
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,708
I'm a princess after all.

505
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,250
I was waiting for you to say it.

506
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,083
I am so angry.

507
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,541
I am really...

508
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,291
Damn it.

509
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,708
What the hell is this?

510
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,000
Cut. Wrong lines.

511
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,333
Director, what kind of line is this?

512
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,875
How did my guts become hot dogs?

513
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,500
Mr. Marco, listen to me.
A New Year film can't be too violent.

514
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,166
- What about all that violence aesthetic?
- The aesthetic of violence.

515
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,500
Attention, everyone.
Mr. Marco is pissed off.

516
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,666
Something big happens.

517
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,500
- My acting was so good.
- Mr. Marco is pissed off.

518
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,083
Why can't you just cooperate?

519
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,875
Our target audience includes children.

520
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:14,083
The aesthetic of violence can also
bring out the innocence.

521
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:18,958
Seeing my guts as hotdogs,
I almost burst out laughing.

522
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,333
How can I get into character?

523
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,416
It's all about commercial consideration.
It's complicated.

524
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,625
You're an amazing actor.

525
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,500
The hotdogs won't be a problem for you.

526
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,875
Of course, it won't.

527
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,291
But you're insulting
the audience's intelligence.

528
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,041
New Year movie, my ass.

529
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,166
You might as well add a cute kidney.

530
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,416
- Props. Get me a kidney.
- Copy that.

531
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,625
Okay. Right away.

532
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,541
Director, would this work?

533
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,125
Dip it into the ketchup and let's see.

534
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,416
Hold this higher later.

535
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,500
- This is the one.
- Ready. Actors in position.

536
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:04,916
Why hasn't it cut yet?

537
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,291
I'm worn out.

538
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:08,750
Attention everyone.

539
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,250
Mr. Marco is here. Make way.

540
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,875
Attention. Mr. Marco is here.

541
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,166
Stupid director, making a stupid movie.

542
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,125
The old me would have slapped him.

543
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,333
Why don't you do it now?

544
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm a classy gentleman now.

545
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,250
What are you laughing at?

546
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,583
- There's nothing here.
- Okay.

547
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,791
- Enough.
- Move there.

548
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,000
What's your problem?

549
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,583
Are you mocking me?

550
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,875
How dare you mock me?

551
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,500
What's so funny?

552
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,916
Attention, everybody. Mr. Marco is angry.

553
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,708
Something big is happening.
He is so scary.

554
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,291
Mr. Marco is angry.

555
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,416
Dreamy.

556
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,208
Is it really you?

557
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,250
- Young?
- Yes.

558
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,208
Is this special makeup?

559
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,625
Yes.

560
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,125
What happened just now?

561
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:52,625
Nothing.

562
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,875
You can have my meal.

563
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:55,416
It's okay.

564
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,583
Excuse me, sir.
Can I have an extra one, please?

565
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,291
One for each person.

566
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,333
You are just an extra.
Don't be so greedy all the time.

567
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:09,500
Get lost.

568
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,166
Get lost.

569
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,583
If you dare to come back,
I'll call the cops.

570
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,333
I've told you guys earlier.

571
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,000
God is watching everything you do.

572
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,875
Why are you always so mean?

573
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,250
What?

574
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,208
Aren't those lunch boxes for eating?

575
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,458
What the hell?

576
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:30,958
Tell me.

577
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,291
Answer me.

578
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,583
What is it? What answer do you want?

579
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,208
Aren't those lunch boxes for eating?

580
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,416
Yes, so what?

581
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,750
- Why didn't she get one?
- Who?

582
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
That girl with special effect makeup.

583
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,958
- Answer me.
- Okay.

584
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,333
- Answer me.
- Okay.

585
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,666
- Answer me.
- Okay. Don't be like this.

586
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,750
- Why didn't she get one?
- Calm down.

587
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,500
- Why didn't she get one?
- Okay.

588
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,625
Gosh. Why did you hit yourself
with a bottle?

589
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:11,833
I couldn't hit him, could I?

590
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,375
Didn't you see how big he was?

591
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,916
You are indeed...

592
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,958
Did you see our daughter?

593
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,541
No.

594
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,125
And we're just leaving?

595
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,083
Go.

596
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,083
Well...

597
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,458
Do you know?
I saw Marco on set the other day.

598
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,500
- Who's Marco?
- It's Marco.

599
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,083
- Who?
- Never mind.

600
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,958
He was in a bad mood.
He kicked away my lunch box.

601
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,666
So, I asked for another lunchbox,
but they refused.

602
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,666
But suddenly, when I was leaving,
he gave me one.

603
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,708
Does this mean good luck
is coming on my way?

604
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,166
You're just an extra,
don't think too much.

605
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,750
Have some respect for extras.

606
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,208
Many stars started as extras.

607
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,791
Sun Li, Carina Lau, Zhao Liying.

608
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,166
Are you as talented as they are?

609
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,458
We're all special in our own ways.

610
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,000
I work harder than they do.

611
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,166
I don't know what to say.

612
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,375
Anyway, opportunities are reserved
for the hardworking people.

613
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:19,500
It's impossible that I would be discovered
just by standing on the streets, right?

614
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:20,833
Excuse me, miss.

615
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,416
Would you like to be in a movie?

616
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,916
Who are you?

617
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,583
She is a famous producer.

618
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,416
Hi, I'm Dreamy. I'm an actor.

619
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,166
Hi, we're looking for actors in our movie.

620
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,625
Are you interested?

621
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, I want to try.

622
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,416
Sorry, it's not you.

623
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,416
It's you.

624
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,958
- Me?
- Yes.

625
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,833
Give it a try?
Our company is just over there.

626
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,083
No worries.

627
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,000
At least, you tried.

628
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,541
Don't be sad.

629
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,791
They picked me as the female lead.

630
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:20,416
Really?

631
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,416
I don't know how to act.
Why would they pick me?

632
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,375
I went in and they removed my makeup.
I only said two lines.

633
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:29,125
Then, I am chosen. What should I do now?

634
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,750
What do you mean?
It's a great opportunity.

635
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:34,750
If it were me, I would trade
50 years of my life for this chance.

636
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,583
But I don't want it.

637
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:40,041
I'm so scared.
I don't want to be an actor.

638
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,458
It's okay.

639
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,041
Don't cry.

640
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,250
I'm so innocent.

641
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,916
I can't let
the entertainment industry ruin me.

642
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,083
I don't mind to be ruined.

643
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,791
Perhaps you can recommend me to them.

644
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,208
I've already told them.

645
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,458
I asked them to let you in,
but they said they would rather die.

646
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,000
They would rather die?

647
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,958
Yes, they said they would rather die.

648
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,708
- They would rather die.
- What should I do?

649
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,041
- Mr. Huang from Hong Kong was here today.
- The car is over there.

650
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,958
Okay. Is everything fine?

651
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,666
- Don't worry. Everything is ready.
- Hi.

652
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,250
- You're still here?
- Thank you for giving me the chance.

653
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,041
- Do your best.
- Sure.

654
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,166
Do you want a ride?

655
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,625
Sure, I live nearby.

656
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,083
Take the back seat.

657
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,083
Mimi move out so soon?

658
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,250
She has moved everything.

659
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,958
She even took my soap and sanitary pads.

660
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,458
I've told you.

661
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:58,750
She is cheap.

662
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,000
I shouldn't have asked Mimi
to eat with me.

663
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
If I had gone there myself,

664
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,833
they would have picked me.

665
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:12,333
Even without Mimi,
they might not have picked you.

666
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,500
Aren't opportunities reserved
for the hardworking people?

667
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:24,208
It means that the opportunity
wasn't meant for you, but for Mimi.

668
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,833
But if she doesn't try her best,
she will eventually screw up.

669
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,125
Hang in there. You'll get the chance.

670
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,750
You're right. I'll try even harder.

671
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:43,333
I'll send out my CV all over China.

672
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,833
I want everyone to know
what acting actually means.

673
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,166
Well said.

674
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,083
Be positive.

675
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,583
I'm short on cash for my start-up,
but I still have hope.

676
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,541
- How much do you need?
- Twenty thousand dollars.

677
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,708
- How about you use the wedding fund?
- No.

678
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,875
If so, we would never get married.

679
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,416
Maybe I can work overtime
or get a part-time job.

680
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,916
Don't worry. Just do your part well.

681
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,500
Otherwise, I will feel bad.

682
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,083
- Get to work.
- Lighting department, hurry.

683
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:18,750
Help me to deliver that.

684
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,250
Sir.

685
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:22,875
- I have one here.
- Okay.

686
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,458
- Excuse me.
- Add three more.

687
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:29,166
Sir, I need money.
Do you have any work that pays more?

688
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,125
Pay more? Who do you think you are?

689
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,458
I can do anything.
I'm not picky about jobs.

690
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,166
- What is this?
- Help me. Please.

691
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,583
Thank you.

692
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:50,041
Are you kidding me?

693
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,958
Go away. I don't know what you're saying.

694
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,875
Who hired the double?

695
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,125
I beg you, miss. Please put on clothes.

696
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,916
- Get out.
- She is scary.

697
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,708
Sorry, Director. I didn't know
she'd look so bad without clothes.

698
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,583
Are you kidding?
Where do you find this kind of people?

699
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,416
Bad figure and saggy skin.

700
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
- She even has black stains on her ass.
- Sorry, Director.

701
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,541
You might as well ask me to do it.

702
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,875
- Go get me another one.
- Dreamy.

703
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:22,750
Are you okay?

704
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,375
I'm fine.

705
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:27,125
The director said I have
a bad figure and saggy skin.

706
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:28,750
They begged me to put my clothes on.

707
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,083
I am really fine.

708
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:12,541
{\an8}HIRING STUNT DOUBLE
HIRING EXTRAS FOR DROWNING SCENE

709
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:35,916
Come, hurry up.

710
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,750
Don't touch her.

711
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,083
Everyone, do it again
in the same angle. Okay!

712
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,791
Ready!

713
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,083
Start!

714
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,916
- Are you ready?
- In a minute.

715
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,916
- Director.
- Let me do this.

716
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,041
Do I need to move later?

717
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,000
Damn it. Have you ever seen
a moving statue?

718
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,750
- No.
- Why don't you use real statues?

719
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,916
Because they're too expensive. Get lost.

720
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,875
- Here.
- He is here.

721
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,250
Dreamy, are there any acting tips
to be a statue?

722
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,916
I see. Meditating to appear lifeless.

723
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'll try this.

724
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:56,208
- Everyone, stand by.
- Hurry. Let's begin.

725
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:00,041
This scene is about the prince waking up
and realizes that Snow White is a man.

726
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:01,791
Rolling.

727
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,583
Shot Four. Take One.

728
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,291
Who are you?

729
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,250
I'm Snow White.

730
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,333
Did I sleep with you?

731
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,333
What are you doing?

732
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,958
It's only lust for you, but love for me.
Why are you so upset?

733
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:47,000
Director, get someone
to explain the scene to him.

734
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,666
Come on. Let's do the close-up
of me killing him first.

735
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,750
- Mr. Marco, do you know your lines?
- Stop the nonsense. It's late!

736
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:56,750
Okay, ready.

737
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:00,791
What's the line?

738
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:06,166
"It's all the fault of my body.
You heartless man."

739
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,166
Okay, again.

740
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,708
It's all the fault of...

741
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,500
Whose fault is it?

742
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,750
- "It's all the fault of my body.
- "It's all the fault of my body.

743
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,416
- You heartless man."
- You heartless man."

744
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,666
I got it. Okay.

745
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,708
<i>It's all the fault...</i>

746
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,541
<i>of my boobs.</i>

747
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:30,583
Sorry, Mr. Marco. It should be "body."

748
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,041
It's the same.

749
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,833
It's just a bit off.
The audience will understand.

750
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:38,541
We have a lot of underage audiences,
it'd better be pronounced accurately.

751
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,250
Kids don't care about pronunciation.

752
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,750
Why don't you say one, two, three?
We can dub the lines later.

753
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,208
You're letting me count the numbers?

754
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,208
Are you insulting me?

755
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:46,750
No, this is easier.

756
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,833
Easier? Why didn't you say this earlier?

757
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,875
You wasted my time, you damn fool.

758
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,666
Come on, shoot.

759
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,666
Ready.

760
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,500
One, two, three...

761
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,958
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- One, two, three, four, five, six...

762
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,166
Got it. Roll.

763
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,625
One, two, three, four, five, six...

764
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:10,625
Eight...

765
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,041
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- One, two, three, four, five, six...

766
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,083
Who wrote these lines?

767
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,125
It doesn't make any sense.
How can I memorize this?

768
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,333
My Chinese is not good.
Let's do it in English.

769
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:23,666
Okay. Ready.

770
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:52,916
What is he doing?

771
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,166
Mr. Marco, what's wrong with you?

772
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,125
Can't you understand simple English?

773
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,125
No, I don't.

774
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,375
And the way you were doing it...

775
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,916
Of course, you won't understand.
But if you insist, I'll tell you.

776
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,041
Attention, everyone.

777
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,458
Mr. Marco is giving acting lessons.
Something amazing is happening.

778
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,416
I killed my beloved by myself.

779
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,958
My emotions are extremely complicated.

780
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,958
Sad, fear, selfish, vanity, arrogant,
excited, shy and so on.

781
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,916
Those emotions...

782
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,708
The emotions intertwined.

783
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:29,666
Then, they leave.

784
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,666
Do you get it? You even cut me off.

785
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,708
I'm sorry. I thought
you were having a seizure.

786
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:36,958
Seizure?

787
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,875
My acting was amazing,
but you thought I was sick.

788
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,166
Didn't you guys see it?
Didn't you guys see my amazing acting?

789
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,083
Hey!

790
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,250
What are you doing?

791
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,458
I'm giving acting lessons
and yet you are sleep?

792
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,750
Sorry, Mr. Marco.

793
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,041
It's you again.

794
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:53,958
Here. Come here.

795
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,375
This statue is too clean. The texture is
not good. How can you film this?

796
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,666
None of your business. Go away.

797
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,333
I didn't sleep well last night.
I didn't intend to yawn.

798
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,666
Here. Get down on the ground.

799
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,083
Quickly.

800
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,500
You keep moving.

801
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:14,041
The texture is not good. You're way
too clean. How can they film this?

802
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,333
This won't look good.

803
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,000
Where's the dirt? Where's the texture?

804
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,791
It's no use. It's not dirty enough.

805
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,625
Fine. Don't use this statue anymore.

806
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,166
Don't look. Let's go.

807
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,166
- Hurry.
- Go.

808
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,166
Get to work. Stop looking.

809
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,416
Give this to him.

810
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,041
And this one.

811
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,500
That one.

812
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:41,958
Hello.

813
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,541
<i>How are you recently? Is everything okay?</i>

814
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,333
I'm pretty good, Mom.

815
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:47,666
Everything is fine.

816
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,125
That's good.

817
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,958
Remember to be humble
and learn from others.

818
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,333
You have said it so many times.

819
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,791
I remember.

820
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,750
<i>Your dad and I are worried
that you will be bullied.</i>

821
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,791
I won't.

822
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,750
Everyone likes me here. Really.

823
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,916
<i>That's good to know.</i>

824
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,291
By the way, Mom.

825
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,916
Is Dad still mad at me?

826
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,458
<i>He is not.</i>

827
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,833
Your dad is having a headache
and is resting now.

828
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,125
Please tell Dad that...

829
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,708
I love you both.

830
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,250
What did you say?

831
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,750
Say that again loudly.

832
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,916
Damn you. Get lost.

833
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:52,041
You should remove your makeup outside.

834
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,333
Are you touched?

835
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,708
Damn you.

836
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:59,000
What is it?

837
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,291
Are you touched?

838
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,500
Dreamy, are you okay?

839
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:05,541
Young.

840
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,958
Please stop asking me if I'm okay.

841
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,291
Your face...

842
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:11,416
They've gone too far.

843
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:14,166
What are you doing?
Don't make things more difficult for me.

844
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,125
I'm short of money. I need this job.

845
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,250
Why didn't you say it earlier?
Money is all I have.

846
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,541
How much do you need? I'll give it to you.

847
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:20,958
Stop joking around with me.

848
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,916
Who do you think you are?

849
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,208
- Can't you see I've reached rock bottom?
- I just want to help out.

850
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,833
If you really want to help,
just leave me alone.

851
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,166
I am sorry.

852
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,375
<i>Wish I could fly a rocket
And fly you to the skies</i>

853
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:06,916
<i>Live together in outer space</i>

854
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:12,083
<i>Live for a thousand years
And be blissful every day</i>

855
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:15,583
<i>Having you by my side is endless fun</i>

856
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:20,958
<i>Being together with you
Is my pride and joy</i>

857
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,750
<i>Fear not the end of the world</i>

858
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:29,791
<i>When the storm comes
As long as I see you</i>

859
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:33,333
<i>It is like a thousand miles of sunshine</i>

860
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,333
<i>Having you around is joyful
And makes everything marvelous</i>

861
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:42,083
<i>Even plain water tastes sweet</i>

862
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,833
<i>Longing to be with you forever</i>

863
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:46,958
<i>I need you every minute</i>

864
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,875
<i>You are my sunlight
You are my breath</i>

865
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:55,750
<i>Dressing up for you
Feeling crazy for you</i>

866
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:59,583
<i>Being a fool for you</i>

867
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,291
<i>Screaming like a crazy person
Is joyful too</i>

868
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:07,541
<i>Having you by my side is endless fun</i>

869
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,041
<i>If I lose you one day
Blossoms would feel sad</i>

870
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:16,916
<i>I would desert the world
To live on an island</i>

871
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:21,458
<i>Carve a figure of the wood
In the memory of you</i>

872
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:25,166
<i>Live alone with the figure of you</i>

873
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,625
<i>-Having you around is joyful
-Having you around is joyful</i>

874
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,916
<i>-And makes everything marvelous
-And makes everything marvelous</i>

875
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,708
<i>-Even plain water tastes sweet
-Even plain water tastes sweet</i>

876
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,375
<i>-Longing to be with you forever
-Longing to be with you forever</i>

877
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,333
<i>-I need you every minute
-I need you every minute</i>

878
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,250
<i>-You are my sunlight
-You are my sunlight</i>

879
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,208
<i>-You are my breath
-You are my breath</i>

880
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,333
Mr. Marco, this is the first shot
of the entire movie.

881
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,000
You ate a poisonous banana
and you realized you've turned into a man.

882
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:59,291
I want you to show a deeper inner fear,

883
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:01,083
or this movie is doomed.

884
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,166
It's not like this...

885
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:04,166
I want true fear.

886
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,291
Show it to me then.

887
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,791
Try expressing it with your eyes.

888
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,041
What are you doing?

889
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:14,666
Do it again.

890
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,041
It truly feels...

891
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:21,625
If you keep doing this,
the movie will be doomed.

892
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:23,791
Do it again.

893
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,166
For example, it's...

894
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,833
Forget it. Take a break.

895
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,125
Well...

896
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,666
Get lost.

897
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:37,833
Hey.

898
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,541
How did it feel?

899
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,583
Are you unhappy?

900
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,250
It's hard to say.

901
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,708
We're all just trying to make
a living here. It's never easy.

902
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,791
Let's not give each other a hard time.
Why so serious?

903
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:01,416
Production assistant.

904
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,666
Give him some water to freshen up.

905
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,416
Director Su.

906
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:17,958
Mr. Marco.

907
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,500
Have you seen the news?

908
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:21,416
I'm busy with filming.
How would I have time?

909
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,541
Do you remember the female extra
you were yelling at?

910
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:25,625
Yes. What is it?

911
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,125
She is dead.

912
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,458
- How did she die?
- She hanged herself.

913
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,791
She wore a red dress
to show her deep grievance.

914
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,208
What is she doing there?

915
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,666
I don't see anyone.

916
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,500
That person in red
who is standing by the wall.

917
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:53,583
Can't you see her?

918
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:56,791
Mr. Marco, stop joking.

919
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,208
Hey.

920
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,708
Get a close-up of him looking scared.

921
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:10,375
Director, why am I looking at the wall?

922
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:11,958
It's not a wall. It's an ocean.

923
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,583
You're watching the ocean at an ice rink.

924
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,375
You see your crush, Mr. Marco.

925
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,291
You dare not look at him,
so you steal a glance at him.

926
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:20,750
Then, hide behind the wall
and steal a glance again. Got it?

927
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:21,708
Got it.

928
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,375
Now, have courage.

929
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:47,916
Give your love token,
the necklace to him happily.

930
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,125
This is for you.

931
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,583
Great. Cut!

932
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,708
This is perfect.

933
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,000
Director, he...

934
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,333
- He peed his pants. What should I do?
- Never mind, hold on.

935
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,666
Sorry, Mr. Marco. Don't be angry.

936
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,041
That was the expression I needed.

937
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,583
You can do it. Let's continue.

938
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,291
- Let's get ready...
- No.

939
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,750
- He gets angry.
- He peed his pants.

940
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,583
I need to go to the hospital.

941
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:21,125
Well...

942
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,958
You'd better think of a good way
to compensate me for this.

943
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,125
Sorry, Mr. Marco.

944
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,666
I just wanted a better effect.

945
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,708
You could've just told me how.

946
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:32,166
I'm an experienced actor.
It's not that I can't do it.

947
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,750
I kept asking and you kept failing.

948
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:37,708
So you came up with this terrible plan
to deal with me?

949
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,500
Attention, everyone.
Mr. Marco pissed his pants.

950
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:41,500
What did you just say?

951
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,750
Attention, everyone.
Mr. Marco did not piss his pants.

952
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:45,875
They're just wet.

953
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:47,625
I've had enough of you.

954
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,208
I've been in the movie business
for decades.

955
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:54,041
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

956
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,708
How is it possible for an extra

957
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,708
to humiliate a world-renowned star?

958
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,125
What the hell?

959
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,333
Where's the justice?

960
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,500
- How dare you still stand there?
- I am sorry.

961
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:11,708
No, you stay.

962
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:13,250
You go.

963
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,458
Yes. You should go.

964
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,583
I meant you, Marco.

965
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,583
You should leave.

966
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,666
You, young people these days...

967
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:25,750
You're so inexperienced
and come up with this method.

968
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,666
I can totally...

969
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,208
I totally understand.

970
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:32,583
I had to do this
because your acting is too bad.

971
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,958
Then, why did you hire me
in the first place?

972
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,583
Because your rate is cheap
and everyone else was busy.

973
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:39,083
You've been a total washed-up actor
for years.

974
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,166
I thought you would cherish this chance.

975
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,291
But it turned out like this.

976
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:45,083
You're a failure because you don't have
what it takes to be an actor.

977
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,916
We're running out of time. It's late.

978
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,750
Everyone, get ready. Let's roll again.

979
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,166
Don't worry about it. We're replacing you.

980
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,166
Don't go too far.

981
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,750
I have made a concession.

982
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:59,083
Aren't you good at that?

983
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,041
We should talk.

984
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,166
Get back to work. Come on.

985
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,125
Director.

986
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:11,250
I do appreciate you giving me this role.

987
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:14,750
I think about repaying you
even in my dreams.

988
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:17,250
Can you return the script to me?

989
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,583
Please don't do this.
I haven't worked for seven or eight years.

990
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:24,875
Do me a favor. I can't lose this job.

991
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:26,875
I'll give you half my commission.

992
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,250
Deal?

993
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,125
- Do me a favor.
- I can't.

994
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,083
Please?

995
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:33,375
Take back the script from him.

996
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,833
Mr. Marco.

997
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,750
- Please don't.
- Let go.

998
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,750
- Do it for my sake, please.
- Let go.

999
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,833
- Let go!
- Let go!

1000
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,375
Mr. Marco. I'm so sorry.

1001
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:59,041
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Don't say a word.

1002
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,958
- I didn't know it would turn out that way.
- I don't need anyone's sympathy.

1003
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:09,333
Coming here makes me feel like fighting.

1004
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:12,166
You weren't fighting,
you were just beating yourself up.

1005
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,333
Marco.

1006
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,416
I haven't seen you for a while.

1007
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:23,416
So you're still acting.

1008
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,416
Hey, I'm taller than you.

1009
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,041
You've got saggy skin.

1010
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,541
Dad, Mom.

1011
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,625
She is my daughter.

1012
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:31,333
- What are you doing here?
- Let's take a selfie.

1013
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,333
- Let's take a selfie.
- Please stop.

1014
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,416
Come on, let's pose together.

1015
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:36,583
Darling.

1016
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,958
- What pose?
- Show me the heart pose.

1017
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,208
Come on, be a good boy.

1018
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:41,375
Smile.

1019
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,083
One, two, three. Yes.

1020
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,166
It's done.

1021
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,791
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Marco.

1022
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:49,750
Mr. Marco.

1023
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:52,000
Let me tell you,
when my daughter was a kid,

1024
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:55,166
she watched your movie, <i>Orphan Adventure</i>
and fell in love with acting.

1025
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,958
You're her inspiration.

1026
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:58,083
Mom, please stop.

1027
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,208
Mr. Marco, please forgive us.

1028
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:02,166
My whole family is your fans.

1029
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,541
Mr. Marco.

1030
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,125
My daughter won't listen to me.

1031
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:13,125
But she is just not cut out for this.

1032
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,375
Can you help me talk her out of it?

1033
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,375
She works very hard.

1034
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,666
She'll make it.

1035
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,958
Thank you, Mr. Marco.

1036
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:50,958
Young.

1037
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,291
Your suit looks so nice.
Which role are you playing?

1038
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:56,750
- Do I look all right?
- Whose fancy car is this?

1039
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,291
Dreamy, is 200,000 dollars enough?

1040
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:01,666
I can give you more if you need it.

1041
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:03,125
Stop messing around.

1042
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,458
- Using prop money will get you arrested.
- Boss.

1043
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,416
Time's up. We have to go.

1044
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,916
Wait a minute. I'm almost done.

1045
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,083
Dreamy, just take it.

1046
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:14,375
No need.

1047
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:17,125
I found a part-time job.
I have enough money.

1048
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,416
That's good then.

1049
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,750
So, you're actually rich.

1050
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,333
It's all from my family business.

1051
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,541
- Why did you even become an extra?
- I'm interested in it.

1052
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,166
But I need to go abroad
for my family business soon.

1053
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,291
I can't fool around anymore.

1054
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,666
That's so amazing.

1055
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,541
- I've got to go.
- Okay.

1056
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:37,208
Dreamy.

1057
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,000
Actually, I like you so much.

1058
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,333
Well, I like you too.

1059
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:44,500
No, I mean in a romantic way.

1060
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:48,000
I thought of you as a friend.

1061
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:50,666
- But you wanted to sleep with me?
- Yes.

1062
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,333
What do you like about me?

1063
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:57,625
You've got a beautiful soul.

1064
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:59,250
This kind of saying again.

1065
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,000
- Are you saying I'm ugly on the outside?
- No.

1066
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,166
You look beautiful too.

1067
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,416
That's so fake. Have some imagination.

1068
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Try again with more feeling.

1069
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:06,666
You're really good-looking.

1070
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,000
Just forget it.

1071
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,791
I don't blame you.
The lines are a bit of a stretch.

1072
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:11,750
That's true.

1073
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,875
How dare you.

1074
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:18,416
I've got a boyfriend already.

1075
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:19,375
I know that.

1076
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,458
But thank you anyway.

1077
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,958
I'll be going then.

1078
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,041
- Come and visit me sometimes.
- I'll be in America.

1079
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,583
I won't be able to come back for a while.

1080
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:35,291
You're a big shot now. I'm so envious.

1081
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:36,916
I should be the one who is envious.

1082
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,625
You get to do what you love.

1083
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:40,875
- I'll be rooting for you.
- Sure.

1084
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,125
Hello.

1085
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:49,458
Your food's here.

1086
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,625
It's hard to say.

1087
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,791
Please give me
a five-star rating. Thank you.

1088
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:57,500
- This is mine.
- Thank you.

1089
00:54:57,583 --> 00:55:00,458
- This is yours.
- Okay.

1090
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:01,750
Mimi!

1091
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,125
Try it on.

1092
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,000
It's been a while. How are you?

1093
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:08,916
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

1094
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,083
Director Chen.

1095
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:14,791
My goodness. It's really you.

1096
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:15,916
What an honor to meet you.

1097
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,041
I'm a big fan of your movies.

1098
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:19,958
I love your work.

1099
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:21,166
Thanks.

1100
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,416
- Try this one.
- Okay.

1101
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,875
Actually, I'm an actor. My name is Dreamy.

1102
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,583
If possible, could you give me a chance?

1103
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,958
- I'm willing to play any roles.
- Sure.

1104
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:34,250
Really?

1105
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,166
That's wonderful.

1106
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,666
If you give me a chance,

1107
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:41,208
I won't let you down.

1108
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:42,750
That's good.

1109
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:44,250
Thank you.

1110
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,833
Then, I won't bother you.

1111
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,250
- Excuse me.
- Director Chen, please have a look.

1112
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,208
Director Chen, may I ask you something?

1113
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,500
Which role will I play?
I want to be prepared.

1114
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:01,416
- Do you know her well?
- Not really.

1115
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,666
We'll call you.

1116
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,125
You can go now, thank you.

1117
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,166
I'm sorry.

1118
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,541
May I have your WeChat ID?
I can come anytime to audition.

1119
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:19,166
We don't use WeChat.
Why are you still here?

1120
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:20,625
It's okay.

1121
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:24,208
Can I borrow a pen?
I'll just leave my number.

1122
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:26,666
- So, he can reach me anytime.
- Just go.

1123
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:27,750
Okay.

1124
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,458
- Enough.
- Thank you so much.

1125
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:31,708
We won't be calling you.

1126
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,333
- Just go.
- Didn't you say you'll call me?

1127
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:35,583
Hold on.

1128
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:42,625
I was only being polite.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

1129
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:44,375
Have you never looked into the mirror?

1130
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:46,416
I look at it every day.

1131
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,208
Do you actually think you have a chance?

1132
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,458
- I do.
- No, you don't.

1133
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:55,625
I know the chances are slim,
but I'm willing to wait.

1134
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,750
You don't need to wait.
You'll never get a chance ever.

1135
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,875
How long would "ever" be?

1136
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:06,083
It's from now
until the end of the universe.

1137
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:07,750
Do you understand now?

1138
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:11,250
Well, what about after the universe ends?

1139
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:19,333
People like this
is the biggest disaster to humanity.

1140
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,333
She'll never make it,
but yet she is in denial.

1141
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:26,416
She is not giving up
and keep causing trouble.

1142
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:30,291
We just want your food.
Aren't you here for the delivery?

1143
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:32,208
Sorry, Director Chen.
Sorry for the troubles.

1144
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:33,416
I'll lead her out.

1145
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,250
Let's go.

1146
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,083
What kind of person is that?

1147
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,791
What are you doing?
You're making a fool of yourself.

1148
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,041
I just wanted to fight for a chance.

1149
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,041
Forget about it. It's fate.

1150
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,208
Do you know what fate is?

1151
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:53,208
What is it?

1152
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,333
I never wanted to be a star,
but here I am.

1153
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:57,833
You've always wanted to be a star,
but you're only an extra.

1154
00:57:57,916 --> 00:57:58,875
This is fate.

1155
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,541
Don't fight against fate, okay?

1156
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,291
Charlie, where are you?

1157
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,416
<i>I'm with a client.</i>

1158
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,541
I want to see you.

1159
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:16,541
<i>I still have a meeting later.
I'm really busy.</i>

1160
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,875
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

1161
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,666
Wait, don't hang up.

1162
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:21,916
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1163
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,291
What are you wearing today?

1164
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,916
<i>I wear the same clothes every day.</i>

1165
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:31,458
<i>White shirt and black pants.</i>

1166
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:32,833
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

1167
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:36,208
All right. I'm just curious.

1168
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,041
<i>I'll talk to you soon. Bye.</i>

1169
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:58,750
Okay.

1170
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:01,416
- Let's take a taxi.
- Okay.

1171
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,458
Where can we find a taxi?

1172
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:03,625
Right over there.

1173
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,833
It's raining hard.

1174
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:07,291
Hi, Dreamy. What a coincidence.

1175
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,458
Darling, she is my cousin.
Wait for me for a while.

1176
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:19,958
Who is she?

1177
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,333
A client.

1178
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:23,958
Why did you call me your cousin?

1179
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,833
Whatever. Don't worry about it.

1180
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:30,416
- Let me ask her.
- Hey.

1181
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:35,416
She is really my client
and you're my client too.

1182
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,958
I provide services, do you get it?

1183
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,541
What kind of services?

1184
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,000
Well...

1185
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:43,791
Boyfriend for hire.

1186
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,458
Are you an escort?

1187
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,250
Whatever, it's the same thing.

1188
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:52,791
Why me?

1189
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,750
Is this my fate?

1190
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,958
Is it because I'm stupid?

1191
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,375
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1192
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:12,541
Ignorance is bliss. It makes you happier.

1193
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,916
All right.

1194
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,083
Give me back my wedding fund.

1195
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:20,000
As for the money,
I'll take good care of it.

1196
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:21,416
Don't worry about it.

1197
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:27,583
The money you need.

1198
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,583
I've got all you need.

1199
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,291
If you want to lie to me,
I'll just let it be.

1200
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:34,916
I'm not scamming you.

1201
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:37,083
I'm just collecting my service fees.

1202
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,500
You can't just dine and dash, right?

1203
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:46,541
You never thought
I would make it as an actress, right?

1204
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:48,416
You'll make it.

1205
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,000
You're the very best.

1206
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,750
As long as you pay me, I'll keep saying it
as often as you wish.

1207
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:00,166
Don't cry. She'll get suspicious.

1208
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,291
Stop it.

1209
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:06,416
Don't give me any trouble.

1210
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,791
Why did you...

1211
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,625
Don't screw it up for me.

1212
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:19,125
Hey, I've asked you
to stop being a junkie.

1213
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,375
It'll kill you.

1214
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,416
Don't ask me for money anymore.

1215
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:25,500
It's never too late
to turn it around, Dreamy.

1216
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,750
You're right.

1217
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,708
Don't lend her any money.

1218
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:30,541
Lending money to her is harming her.

1219
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,083
Are you okay?

1220
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:31,333
Did you fall asleep? Were you drunk?

1221
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,166
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1222
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,041
Of course, not.

1223
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,166
Could it be you are filming?

1224
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:41,541
Are you an actor?

1225
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:44,750
No.

1226
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,166
I'm not an actor.

1227
01:02:57,916 --> 01:02:59,041
I'm awake now.

1228
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,333
You fell asleep.

1229
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:02,625
It is very dangerous.

1230
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,000
Don't do that again.

1231
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:11,750
- Take care of the actors.
- Hurry up. Next scene.

1232
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:14,041
- Get up.
- The next scene is here.

1233
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,916
- Step back.
- Hurry.

1234
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,125
Good day, Assistant Director.

1235
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,958
Mr. Marco. I haven't seen you in a while.
What's your role?

1236
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:23,166
- A courageous dying soldier.
- Just lie down over there.

1237
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,208
Quickly.

1238
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,500
Costumes and makeup, get ready.

1239
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:27,708
Over here, right?

1240
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:29,958
Stick your heads closer together.

1241
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:33,041
- Here, don't move. I'll help you.
- Has it started?

1242
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:35,125
- Hurry.
- Don't move.

1243
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,208
Should I open my eyes?

1244
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:38,750
- Or keep them closed?
- It doesn't matter.

1245
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:40,333
Then, I'll die with open eyes.

1246
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,750
After all, we die in a war.
We want to avenge the nation and family.

1247
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,500
- Dying with regret, I should...
- Don't move.

1248
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:49,000
Okay. Come on.

1249
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,208
Ready.

1250
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:55,666
- Protect the general.
- Be careful.

1251
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:57,541
Quickly.

1252
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,500
- Quick, get cover.
- Get down.

1253
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:09,500
Look at this. What the hell?

1254
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,625
- Where did you get that?
- Tencent WeSee.

1255
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:13,541
Check this out.

1256
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,250
Yes.

1257
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,041
He was so scared that he peed his pants.

1258
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:24,625
Look at him. He is ridiculous.

1259
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,291
- Do you know Marco?
- No, I don't.

1260
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:34,708
No.

1261
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,000
He did wet his pants.

1262
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:46,083
- Let's watch the other clips.
- I can't get enough of this clip.

1263
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:48,041
It's crazy. It's so funny.

1264
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,708
I can't stop laughing.

1265
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:54,291
What a funny guy.

1266
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:58,333
Marco.

1267
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,083
- Marco?
- Yes.

1268
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,500
- Is it really Mr. Marco?
- Yes.

1269
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:03,708
Is it really Marco?

1270
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,333
It does look like him.

1271
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,000
Yes, it's him.

1272
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,041
- Yes, it's Marco.
- It's really Marco.

1273
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,625
- It's really Marco.
- It's Marco.

1274
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:15,833
- Marco!
- It's Marco.

1275
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,875
- Mr. Marco.
- I'm seeing him in person.

1276
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,875
- Marco.
- Let's take a selfie.

1277
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,000
- Take a selfie.
- Come take a picture.

1278
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:24,208
- Look at here.
- Mr. Marco.

1279
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:26,166
- Let's take a picture together.
- I want to take a picture with you.

1280
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,208
- Mr. Marco, that clip was so funny.
- I love it so much.

1281
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:31,250
RECORD-BREAKING VIEWS: MARCO IS BACK

1282
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,625
WASHED-UP CHILD ACTOR
BECAME POPULAR WITH HIS PEEING VIDEO

1283
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:38,083
PEEING HIS PANTS TO SUCCESS
MARCO IS SHOCKED OVER UNEXPECTED FAME

1284
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:42,333
BRANDS FIGHTING OVER NEW STAR,
MARCO ENDORSES BABY NAPPIES

1285
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:47,125
MARCO IS MAD AT PEE MEME.
I'M NOT THE GOD OF PEE.

1286
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:52,083
Mr. Marco, we're so glad
to have you today.

1287
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:55,875
Can you tell about
how you made your comeback?

1288
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:57,750
What "comeback"?

1289
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,791
You're popular once again.

1290
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,708
No, I was asking you
what do you mean by "comeback"?

1291
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:02,708
I...

1292
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,458
- Was I dead or disappear?
- I didn't mean...

1293
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,250
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

1294
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,416
No, what did you mean by "comeback"?

1295
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:10,416
Are you trying to insult me?

1296
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:17,083
- Your acting was really good.
- Of course.

1297
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:20,291
Mr. Marco is absolutely brilliant.
Your emotions can appear anytime.

1298
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:23,416
Sure, when my emotions overflow,
it is unstoppable.

1299
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,833
Can you show us
the "peeing-the-pants" look again?

1300
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:33,625
<i>I think that many children will be
watching this program.</i>

1301
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:34,708
<i>Let's not do that.</i>

1302
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:37,416
<i>You're right. Do you have
any upcoming plans?</i>

1303
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:40,416
<i>I've got many invitations
to take part in the international films.</i>

1304
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,416
- I've met Mr. Marco.
<i>- Like thriller...</i>

1305
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,500
This is the video of me
scaring him to pee his pants.

1306
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:45,708
You're an actor too?

1307
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:48,083
Yes, I used to be an actor.

1308
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,791
Have you met Bruce Lee?

1309
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:51,291
- I've met...
- Hey.

1310
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,291
Stop chatting and get back to work.

1311
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:57,708
<i>There were so many ups and downs
in your life.</i>

1312
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,250
<i>Tell us how you feel.</i>

1313
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,750
<i>I feel so blessed.</i>

1314
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:04,958
<i>Not everyone has this kind of experience.</i>

1315
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:10,208
<i>I am grateful to the person
who scared me in the video.</i>

1316
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:12,541
<i>I wouldn't be here today without her.</i>

1317
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,041
<i>Who is she?</i>

1318
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:16,291
I don't know her name, but...

1319
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:17,833
She is an actor.

1320
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,333
Dreamy.

1321
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,583
Look who's here.

1322
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,666
- You are so handsome today.
- Yes.

1323
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,958
- Mr. Marco.
- Yes, Mr. Marco.

1324
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:33,208
Dreamy, I've finally found you.

1325
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,500
I come all the way to thank you.

1326
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,416
Actually, she didn't do much.
All she did was scared you.

1327
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,625
My hair turned white
from the shock she brought me.

1328
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:41,416
I wouldn't thank her for that.

1329
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,666
- Have a seat, please.
- It smells delicious.

1330
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,250
Mr. Marco, you're so popular now.

1331
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,416
It's all thanks to your scary face.

1332
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,750
You have an amazing daughter.

1333
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:51,666
- You're way too kind.
- She looks like her dad.

1334
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,333
- No, like her mom.
- Looks like her dad.

1335
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:55,375
- Looks like her mom.
- She looks like both of you.

1336
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,791
Also, I want to congratulate you.

1337
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:00,583
You're on the list
for Stephen Chow's new movie.

1338
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:02,125
What?

1339
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,583
You didn't know?

1340
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:06,791
They're recruiting new actors
with real talent.

1341
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,250
I saw your name on the list.

1342
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,333
Where did you see it?

1343
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:10,750
I found it online.

1344
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:13,125
It's held in Beijing tomorrow.
See, right here.

1345
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,166
- What happened to the Internet?
- Sorry.

1346
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,833
It's fine, I'm not going.

1347
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:20,541
Why not?

1348
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:22,041
I have a new job now.

1349
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:23,375
I am not an actor anymore.

1350
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,750
- Why not?
- I'm a waitress now.

1351
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,708
Plus, I'm operating an online shop
and making a decent living.

1352
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,166
Dad and Mom are satisfied.

1353
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,625
Yes. Dreamy is living
a happy and stable life.

1354
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,583
- This is good for her.
- Yes, it is.

1355
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:37,833
- Here, Mr. Marco.
- Yes.

1356
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:39,541
It's a good thing.

1357
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,458
It's good.

1358
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:43,375
What's the matter?

1359
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,625
- I'm just not feeling well.
- Is it menopause?

1360
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,583
Nonsense. He is way too young.

1361
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,041
Is it a heart attack?

1362
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,125
- Quick, call the ambulance.
- No need. I'm okay.

1363
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,500
- It could be serious.
- I'm fine.

1364
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,416
Seeing Dreamy living a good life,

1365
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,208
I'm feeling quite sad.

1366
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,500
Don't get me wrong.

1367
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:05,583
What I meant was

1368
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:10,916
it's like an undefeatable boxer
giving up before the match even starts.

1369
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,291
I didn't give up,
but I just came to my senses.

1370
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:16,375
I don't fantasize
about being a star anymore.

1371
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:17,916
You're giving up.

1372
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:21,416
Mr. Marco.

1373
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,708
It has been more than a decade.

1374
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,375
I was ridiculed and rejected every day.

1375
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,583
Nobody wanted to see me acting.

1376
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,416
I've never gotten
a single moment of respect.

1377
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,291
I've had enough.

1378
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:37,625
Why?

1379
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,041
What do you mean by that?

1380
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:41,625
Why did you give up?

1381
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,125
This is not giving up.

1382
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,291
It's just...

1383
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:47,291
It's just that I'm not cut out for it.

1384
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,041
Hard work doesn't always pay off.

1385
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:53,291
I told you so, but you insisted.

1386
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:55,625
Let her be. She was bullied all the time.

1387
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:57,875
I know, I get it.

1388
01:09:58,166 --> 01:09:59,666
I totally understand.

1389
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:03,875
I came here just to show my gratitude.

1390
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,125
I have something to do. I've got to go.

1391
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:07,541
Let's finish the meal first.

1392
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,333
Mr. Marco, have dinner before you leave.

1393
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,625
Yes, Mr. Marco.

1394
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,875
I think that success
is all about not giving up.

1395
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,166
You taught me that.

1396
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,875
- Maybe I should give it a try...
- I knew you will be like this.

1397
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:45,041
You useless bum.

1398
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,166
Go.

1399
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:48,875
- Book her a ticket.
- Hey.

1400
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,833
Train or plane?

1401
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,500
- Plane.
- Got it.

1402
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:53,916
- First class.
- Yes.

1403
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:55,666
Get out of here.

1404
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,291
I don't need that much, Dad.

1405
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:03,791
Take it. You're just a bum.

1406
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,291
- Let me tell you...
- I've got the tickets.

1407
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:07,125
- Go now.
- Is it first class?

1408
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,000
- Thank you, Mom.
- Okay.

1409
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:12,583
Dad, you're the best.

1410
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,875
- Silly girl, don't ever come back.
- All right.

1411
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:19,041
- Did you take the house keys?
- I got it.

1412
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:23,500
BODY MOVEMENT

1413
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:41,000
I'm a robot.

1414
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,208
Thank you, next.

1415
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,666
Good day, judges.

1416
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:54,208
I'm a growing mushroom.

1417
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,416
- It has...
- Okay, next.

1418
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,958
Hurry up. Next.

1419
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:00,916
EMOTIONAL CONTROL

1420
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,916
Mom!

1421
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:04,375
Grandpa! Grandma!

1422
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:07,083
Uncle! Cousin!

1423
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:08,708
Brother-in-law.

1424
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,375
Aunt!

1425
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:14,625
Why does this happen to me?

1426
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:27,375
My whole family is dead.

1427
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,166
Fantastic. Next.

1428
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:34,333
Good day, judges.

1429
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:43,791
Okay, next.

1430
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:45,375
Sorry, please let me indulge myself.

1431
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,000
- I just need five minutes.
- Hey!

1432
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:49,708
Five minutes?
There are over a hundred people waiting.

1433
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:52,125
TALENT SHOWCASE

1434
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:24,166
Thank you.

1435
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,916
That's very good. Next.

1436
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:30,875
Good day, judges.

1437
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,916
I can make sounds by my hands.

1438
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,083
Next.

1439
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:38,750
I'm sorry.

1440
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,875
This is a talent showcase.

1441
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,750
Idiot.

1442
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:45,791
ROLE PLAY

1443
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,833
Good day, judges. I will play a hero.

1444
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:49,875
All right. Start.

1445
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,250
I, Chen Zhen, will take revenge today.

1446
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:04,291
Who killed my master?

1447
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,666
Good day, judges.

1448
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,291
I will play a spy.

1449
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:11,708
All right. Get started.

1450
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:15,458
Boss, what are you doing?
Aren't we supposed to be playing mahjong?

1451
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:16,583
Don't.

1452
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,708
Hey. Boss, it hurts.

1453
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,333
Please don't use your belt.

1454
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,750
- Good day, judges.
- Hurry up.

1455
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:29,750
I play a con man.

1456
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:31,333
Go ahead.

1457
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:36,875
- Hurry. There are over a hundred people.
- Darling.

1458
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:39,791
Hey.

1459
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:42,541
Darling, she is my cousin.
Wait for me for a while.

1460
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:49,666
Who is she?

1461
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:51,375
A client.

1462
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,333
Why did you call me your cousin?

1463
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:56,416
Whatever. Don't worry about it.

1464
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,791
- Let me ask her.
- Don't.

1465
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:03,000
She is really my client
and you're my client too.

1466
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,666
I provide services, do you get it?

1467
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,041
What kind of services?

1468
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,541
Well...

1469
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,958
Boyfriend for hire.

1470
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,750
Are you an escort?

1471
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:18,291
Whatever, it's the same thing.

1472
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:20,250
Why me?

1473
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:22,166
{\an8}Is it because I'm stupid?

1474
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:25,625
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1475
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:31,583
Ignorance is bliss. It makes you happier.

1476
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,583
The money you need. I've got all you need.

1477
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,333
If you want to lie to me,
I'll just let it be.

1478
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:41,375
I'm not scamming you.

1479
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,333
I'm just collecting my service fees.

1480
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:48,041
You can't just dine and dash, right?

1481
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:54,625
You never thought
I would make it as an actress, right?

1482
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:55,958
You'll make it.

1483
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,541
You're the very best.

1484
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:02,500
As long as you pay me, I'll keep saying it
as often as you wish.

1485
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:07,541
Don't cry. She'll get suspicious.

1486
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,791
Don't screw it up for me.

1487
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:22,833
Hey, I've asked you
to stop being a junkie.

1488
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,125
It'll kill you.

1489
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:27,041
It's never too late to turn it around.

1490
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,916
Thank you.

1491
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,958
Why did you hit me?

1492
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,458
I'm not the cousin.

1493
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,708
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

1494
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,375
Can you switch the role
and be the victim now?

1495
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:43,708
Sure.

1496
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,541
Are you an escort?

1497
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:56,250
Whatever, it's the same thing.

1498
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:01,791
How could you do this?

1499
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:05,208
Don't cry. She'll get suspicious.

1500
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,750
You look like a retard.

1501
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:15,875
How could you be an escort?

1502
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:20,500
You can say anything about me,
but don't say I'm a retard.

1503
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:22,458
That's not true.

1504
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,541
I've touched your nerve, haven't I?

1505
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:28,291
You must have been seen
as a retarded since young.

1506
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:30,875
So now, you scam people
to boost your self-esteem.

1507
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:33,541
That's bullshit.
Everyone loved me since I was a kid.

1508
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,541
They didn't love you.
They just pitied you.

1509
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:37,291
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

1510
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,208
Someone like you
doesn't deserve to be loved.

1511
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:41,125
I...

1512
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:45,333
You lowlife.

1513
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:47,541
Everyone loves you?

1514
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:50,833
How could you be an escort with this face?
I'm going to kill you.

1515
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:57,083
- Why did you do this again?
- My goodness. I'm so sorry.

1516
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,208
I really didn't mean to hurt you.

1517
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:01,583
All right. Enough. Next.

1518
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,375
So sorry.

1519
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,208
Hey.

1520
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,250
That way. You're shortlisted.

1521
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:44,541
ONE YEAR LATER

1522
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:56,458
- Hey, what are you doing?
- We're here looking for our daughter.

1523
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:58,916
Look for her at the police station.
There's an event tonight.

1524
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,708
- Please go upstairs.
- Thank you.

1525
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:16,625
I have all sorts of feelings
after hearing this song.

1526
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,083
I wonder if everyone here
feels the same way.

1527
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:20,958
- Over there.
- Okay, let's continue with the awards.

1528
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:24,166
The competition for the best actress award
this year is intense.

1529
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:30,083
The nominees are from all generations
in the Chinese movie industry.

1530
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:32,375
Who'll win the crown
of today's best actress award?

1531
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:36,541
Prior to that, let's enjoy the footages
before they became famous.

1532
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:42,583
Lin Yun was quite pretty before.

1533
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:44,750
Yes.

1534
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:48,791
Who's that?

1535
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,291
That's Dreamy.

1536
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:53,583
You're right.

1537
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,166
Please welcome
our award presenters on stage.

1538
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:24,166
It's an honor tonight
to give out this award.

1539
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:27,541
The best actress award goes to...

1540
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:34,416
This actress was really
one-of-a-kind from the beginning

1541
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,333
- to the end of the universe.
- Just cut the crap.

1542
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,416
Life is but a dream.

1543
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:44,291
Dreamy.

1544
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:57,333
You did it.

1545
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:08,083
Congratulations.

1546
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,041
Dreamy.

1547
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:12,541
Dreamy.

1548
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:14,958
Dreamy.

1549
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:05,125
- Dreamy!
- Dreamy!

1550
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:09,708
- Dreamy!
- Dreamy!

1551
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:14,750
- Dreamy!
- Dreamy!

1552
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:18,041
- Dreamy!
- Dreamy!

1553
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:20,000
- Dreamy.
- It's all right.

1554
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:21,250
It's all right.

1555
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,083
Hello, Dreamy. I'm a fan of yours.

1556
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,666
I love all your movies.

1557
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,708
Thank you.

1558
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:29,791
I am an actor too.
Do you think I have the chance to succeed?

1559
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:31,166
Do you really love acting?

1560
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,833
I was born to act. Will I make it?

1561
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:35,458
No, you won't.

1562
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:39,791
From now until the end of the universe,
you have no chance.

1563
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:40,750
Do you understand?

1564
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,041
I get it.

1565
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:45,125
So, what are you going to do?

1566
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:49,125
I'll go back to being a farmer.

1567
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:51,375
No, you can't.

1568
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,791
Don't let people tell you what to do.

1569
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,666
Keep it up.

1570
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:57,375
You can make it.

1571
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,666
I get it. Thank you.

1572
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,166
Thousand.

1573
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,500
Thousand wrongs.

1574
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:22,750
Ten thousand.

1575
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:27,041
Thousand...

1576
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:50,916
You.

1577
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:53,375
What is it? Did I ask you to do that?

1578
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,416
Your turn.

1579
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:58,250
Come here.

1580
01:24:58,333 --> 01:24:59,208
A sad reaction.

1581
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:05,416
Give me a sad reaction.

1582
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,708
Put in more emotions.

1583
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,750
You. Do a sad reaction.

1584
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:16,583
Sad.

1585
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,875
Okay. You can come.

1586
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:19,875
This is good.

1587
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:21,083
This is okay.

1588
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,458
Like this.

1589
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:33,041
Okay.

1590
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:37,625
Hit her.

1591
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:38,916
The first move.

1592
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,208
Do it harder for the first move.

1593
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,375
Scream louder.

1594
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:44,500
- Louder?
- Of course.

1595
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:53,583
Maybe she will scream louder
when you hit her later.

1596
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,125
