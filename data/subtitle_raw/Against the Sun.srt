1
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:32,717
1942.

2
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:34,873
The South Pacific.

3
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:38,657
The New Year finds USS Enterprise

4
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:41,026
and her crew of 2000 men

5
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:43,929
preparing to deliver
greetings to the Japanese

6
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,064
in the form of

7
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:48,333
torpedo bombers and fighter planes.

8
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,368
With last month's attack

9
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:51,704
on Pearl Harbor still fresh

10
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:53,939
in the minds of these American aviators

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,670
that revenge is a dish best served...

12
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:59,251
Piping hot!

13
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:16,423
Chief, this is Aldrich.

14
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:19,934
Uh, I'm losing her on the Hayrake.

15
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:25,846
Come on. Where you going?

16
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:35,365
Chief, I've lost the beacon, over.

17
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,877
Are we close, Chief?

18
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,181
I'll give him a tap.
Maybe his comm is down.

19
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:43,182
Chief?

20
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:46,298
Can you hear us, over?

21
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:48,527
Loud and clear, boys.

22
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:51,291
Just waiting for this wind
to tell me which direction

23
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,162
she wants to blow.

24
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,335
Pastula, take another drift
sight. That's not how I'm

25
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:02,436
reading those wave tops.

26
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,577
Yes, Chief.

27
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,215
15 degrees.

28
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:12,798
Same read as the outbound, Chief.

29
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,932
If that's correct

30
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:21,322
she's off to the east.

31
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:22,923
I had her west.

32
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:26,092
I'm taking her east.

33
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:47,548
6- Tare-14 requesting
an inbound bearing, over?

34
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,383
Chief, we've broken radio silence!

35
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:52,564
Affirmative.
We need a bearing.

36
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:56,157
Confirm you're on 79.

37
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,326
Seven-niner confirmed.
I reckon we're still too far out.

38
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,147
Well, keep trying.

39
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,800
Blue Base, this is 6-Tare-14.

40
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,301
Do you read?
Come in, Blue Base.

41
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:08,302
Over.

42
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,109
Chief?

43
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,110
Go.

44
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:16,977
On the MF.

45
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,758
I heard Jap talk.

46
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,248
I pulled the plug.

47
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:22,284
Roger that. Let's go
silent on Morse.

48
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:25,145
Silent on Morse, affirmative.

49
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,912
How are we on fuel, Chief?

50
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,458
Low.

51
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:36,031
Pastula, we need to make
altitude. Drop the ordnance.

52
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:37,232
Aye-aye, Chief.

53
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,373
Bombs away.

54
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:50,411
Aldrich

55
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:51,246
hit that MF.

56
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,181
But the Japs, Chief.

57
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,182
Do it!

58
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:56,617
Blue Base

59
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:59,554
this is 6-Tare-14.
Do you read? 6-Tare-14

60
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:02,324
to Blue Base. Come in,
Blue Base, over.

61
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,515
Like hell she's east.

62
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,609
Enterprise, this is 6-Tare-14.

63
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,877
Do you read?

64
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,044
Get on it, Aldrich!

65
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:24,195
I'm on it.

66
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:26,323
We're out of range.

67
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:55,277
Boys...

68
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,302
before we run out of fuel.

69
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,316
Snug up your vests

70
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,551
and stand by for a
water landing. Understood?

71
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:03,319
Damn!

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,687
Affirmative, Chief.

73
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:05,688
Pastula?

74
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,993
Aldrich, gather the
flares, the smoke candles

75
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,194
and the first aid kit.

76
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,430
We're going to need the flashlights.

77
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:15,698
Pastula, grab the rations and the water

78
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,400
and ready the life raft.

79
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,041
And keep your heads, boys.

80
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,173
Pass this back.

81
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,174
Got it.

82
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:26,809
Coming through.

83
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,680
Grab a parachute!

84
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,911
A parachute?

85
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,879
Prepare to ditch.

86
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:46,357
Brace for impact!

87
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:56,304
Ahhh!

88
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,727
Pastula!

89
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,627
Here, chief.

90
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:18,195
Aldrich!

91
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:18,996
Here!

92
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:20,817
Step lively, boys!

93
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:44,687
C'mon!

94
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,225
Chief!

95
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:50,794
Ahh!

96
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,667
Oh, no!

97
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:22,274
Come here.

98
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,849
Damn thing won't inflate!

99
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:40,544
Ahh!

100
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,400
The valve is jammed!
Train that beam.

101
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,288
Unship your weapons.

102
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,941
They're dragging us down.

103
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,946
I can't get it!

104
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,307
There goes mine!

105
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:05,435
Mine too.

106
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,248
That makes a difference.

107
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,144
This...

108
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,419
Damn thing.

109
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,243
There it goes!

110
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,221
It's too heavy to lift!

111
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:25,502
Maybe if we-

112
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,357
Aldrich!

113
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:39,570
If you get trapped under there again

114
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,339
just deflate the vest a little bit.

115
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,407
Swim down and out.
Understood?

116
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,328
I can't swim much.

117
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:46,845
You're kidding.

118
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:47,579
You?

119
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,400
Not really, Chief.

120
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:51,516
Oh!

121
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:55,003
For crying out-

122
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:05,496
Okay.

123
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:11,823
This is gonna be hard to
turn over in these swells.

124
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,240
If we take off our vests

125
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,242
string 'em together, tie one on here

126
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,777
and throw the other across

127
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:19,511
then we go around and pull.

128
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:20,546
Good idea.

129
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:22,214
Except neither one of you can swim.

130
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:24,616
Just have to hold tight to the hand rail.

131
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:25,757
Real tight.

132
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:29,435
Okay, let's give it a go.

133
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,392
Here.

134
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:41,365
Alright.

135
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:45,621
Okay, go around and I'll toss it over.

136
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:52,811
Okay. Ready?

137
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:53,812
Yeah.

138
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,440
Here it comes!

139
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:57,549
You got it?

140
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,420
Alright we got it.

141
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,790
Alright, get a grip.

142
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,426
Now heave like you mean it!

143
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:09,067
One, two, three!

144
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,612
Hold her down.

145
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:30,033
I'll go around the other side and climb in.

146
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:51,314
Kippers in a can got more space.

147
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:54,288
Let's try laying athwart.

148
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,060
Aldrich...

149
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:19,532
when I was on deck. Didn't
get a good look at you.

150
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,853
Harold Dixon.

151
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:22,922
Gene Aldrich.

152
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,904
You'll get a gander in the morning, Chief.

153
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,839
I'm sure I'll be here.

154
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,409
Pastula.
Is that Italian?

155
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,377
Polish, Chief.

156
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:32,880
I've made a couple of hops with you before.

157
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:33,881
Oh, yeah?

158
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:36,695
I don't remember.

159
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:41,488
We'll be picked up come morning.

160
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,856
You reckon, Chief?

161
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:44,758
That's what I'm hoping.

162
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,759
Hoping?

163
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:51,994
Come early morning, they'll be
on us like an old hound dog.

164
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:03,076
It's so damn hot inside that plane.

165
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:05,447
It's freezing out here.

166
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:33,832
Cock-a-doodle-doo, boys.

167
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:42,161
Well, we made it.

168
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:44,017
I worried she wouldn't keep us afloat

169
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:46,452
but she's still ship-shape.

170
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:47,503
Thank God.

171
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:50,924
Gene Aldrich.

172
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,494
Now I know you.

173
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,496
I couldn't put a face to the name.

174
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:56,631
In all my glory, Chief.

175
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:59,600
Who's up for a fresh cup of coffee?

176
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:00,601
Henree!

177
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,390
Time to put on the pot.

178
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:04,738
Yeah.

179
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:09,553
Thanks, Henry.

180
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,613
'Henry'. Why Henry?

181
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:12,614
Oh, it's

182
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:16,332
that show, you know, off the radio!

183
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:17,684
Henree!

184
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,597
Henry Aldrich!

185
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:25,127
Nah. Never heard of it.

186
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:33,168
You were gonna land in the
drink, I thought 'Boy...

187
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,137
Thought I couldn't land her, huh?

188
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,772
Wasn't that some flying!

189
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:41,141
I mean he just laid her right down.

190
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:43,012
Yeah, he sure did.

191
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:47,549
You know, Aldrich

192
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,217
I've been wondering...

193
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:51,920
I don't understand how you
couldn't raise that carrier.

194
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,521
We couldn't have been more than 20 miles out

195
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:54,892
at one point.

196
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:56,257
Even at 40

197
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:59,660
you should've caught something, right?

198
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:03,851
You tell me, Chief.
How far out were we?

199
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,239
We should keep our eyes peeled.

200
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Right?

201
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:20,152
Everybody take a point.
We need to cover 360.

202
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,847
Good visibility.

203
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:33,496
Yeah, they'll check every
square mile out here.

204
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:36,198
It'll take a while, but
they'll do it, won't they?

205
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,067
Even if it takes all day

206
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,602
or into the morrow.

207
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:40,603
Yep.

208
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:43,572
Could take most of a day.

209
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,241
They'll do a box out to 50.

210
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:46,432
Even a 100.

211
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,043
They've got the viz.

212
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:49,745
Divide that by the number of planes.

213
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:50,513
Heck

214
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,434
it's likely to be
this morning.

215
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:57,399
Maybe we'll get a real
breakfast, huh, Chief?

216
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:16,272
You figure we'll see 'em first
or hear 'em?

217
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:17,273
Shh.

218
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:24,462
See that speck?

219
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,359
That's a bird.

220
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:31,909
It ain't moving its wings.

221
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,027
Wait...

222
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:42,165
That's something, all right.

223
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,256
Steady on her course, whatever-

224
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,901
It's one of ours!

225
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Hey!

226
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,141
Get down!

227
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:55,013
Got plenty of time to drown.

228
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,279
I think it's an SPD.

229
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,214
She's on a bearing.

230
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:01,675
About 140 knots.
Half a mile out.

231
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:05,754
Pastula, grab the parachute.
Spread it on the water.

232
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:06,755
Chief?

233
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,378
No parachute.

234
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:10,827
Aldrich, how about those flares?

235
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,628
I couldn't hold 'em, Chief.

236
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,719
Well, wave something!

237
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Hey!

238
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,103
Look down here!

239
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,071
Hey!

240
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,305
What are you, blind?

241
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,086
Sun's behind you.

242
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:26,610
Check your three o'clock!

243
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,143
Down here!

244
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:28,144
Hey!

245
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:31,947
Hey!

246
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:33,783
Hey! Over here!

247
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:34,834
Down here!

248
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,019
Hey!

249
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:38,954
Hey!

250
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:41,924
Hey!

251
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,110
Look here!

252
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,362
Come on.

253
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:50,624
Where you going?
No-no-no. Where-

254
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:52,101
Hey!

255
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,203
Hey!

256
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,695
We're over here.

257
00:17:58,275 --> 00:17:59,275
Hey!

258
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,211
Hey!

259
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:04,781
Come on!

260
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:06,282
Hey!

261
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:13,323
Hey!

262
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,915
We're here.

263
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:42,219
That was our one and only chance.

264
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:43,721
What?

265
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,772
That was our search.

266
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,758
What do you mean?

267
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,326
They can't just leave us here!

268
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,463
Could be he saw us,
he's goin' back for help.

269
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,733
Why didn't he break course?
Because he's on a box search

270
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,867
is why. Next
pass he'll be

271
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,238
out of sight.

272
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:03,273
Maybe there'll be more
planes double-checking.

273
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:04,274
Or ships.

274
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,144
What the hell are they
telling you in boot camp?

275
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,515
We are at war, Aldrich.

276
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,018
We're in the vicinity of enemy naval forces.

277
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,119
We get one quick look at best.

278
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:20,705
Like you said, there's a procedure.

279
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,231
Alright.

280
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,130
No parachute

281
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:31,853
or flares.

282
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,306
I don't suppose the chart
board made it either?

283
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,487
Affirmative.

284
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,808
First aid kit?

285
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,309
Everything's gone, Chief.

286
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,414
Including the rations and water.

287
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,415
Oh, God.

288
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,519
I don't get it.

289
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,488
I gave the orders in plenty of time

290
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,022
so I could get busy with the landing

291
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,424
and we have no food and no water?!

292
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,745
We were pretty busy not drownin'!

293
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,399
How are we gonna survive
out here with no water?

294
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,878
Okay, coming aft.

295
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,057
Listen up, lads.

296
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,223
This raft is a vessel

297
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,559
of the United States
Navy, and I am her Captain.

298
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,427
As such, I will be giving the orders

299
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,796
and you will be taking them.

300
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:31,797
Are we clear?

301
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:32,497
Aye-aye, Chief.

302
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,498
Aldrich?

303
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,566
Crystal, Chief.

304
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,035
Alright.

305
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,971
Let's take an inventory.

306
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,922
Pockets. Everything.

307
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:44,332
Pile it on the shirt.

308
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,697
Got two magazines.

309
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,448
I got my pocket knife.

310
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,883
Keep that in your pocket!

311
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:55,086
The last thing we need
is a hole in this raft.

312
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,422
Pair of pliers.

313
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,933
A bit of wire.

314
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:01,059
Some cord. Maybe
about 20 feet.

315
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,840
Here's a whistle.

316
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,464
Aldrich.

317
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,367
Rubber cement fluid.

318
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,203
Any patching material in there?

319
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:11,204
Yeah.

320
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:12,939
Huh.

321
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,310
Look at this!

322
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:18,543
We can use it if we see another plane.

323
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,479
Wish we would've found that earlier.

324
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,282
Huh. And a
water bag!

325
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,283
Aha!

326
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:27,742
It's empty.

327
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,993
That's all she's got, chief.

328
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:36,562
No fold-up oars under that thwart, Aldrich?

329
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:37,563
Negative.

330
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,999
Don't forget about the handrail.

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,934
That's about 25 feet of nylon.

332
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:46,125
Yeah, and we've got these two life vests.

333
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,442
No oars.

334
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,077
No flashlights.

335
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,578
No map.

336
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,251
No food. No water.

337
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,753
Chronometers?

338
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,518
Negative.

339
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:01,988
No.

340
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:03,989
No.

341
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,061
But if she stays afloat

342
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:12,612
at least I can figure
her speed and distance.

343
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,636
She looks practically new.

344
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:16,917
That's good.

345
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:18,638
Ah, here.

346
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:20,287
Manufactured

347
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,385
11-30-37.

348
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,045
That's four years old.

349
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:26,096
Plus some.

350
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:29,249
Boys, we should minimize
the wear on the fabric.

351
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Shoes.

352
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:37,658
There's not much room.

353
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,126
On or off, they're liable to scuff.

354
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,457
I say we deep six 'em.

355
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:07,621
They say it's five miles deep out here.

356
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,442
That's impossible.

357
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:14,694
Chief?

358
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,246
I'm thinkin'...

359
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:20,166
Maybe one of us should keep 'em.

360
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,435
If we make land

361
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:24,806
somebody's going to need to walk.

362
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:30,674
Makes sense.

363
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,417
Hey.

364
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:39,553
I've still got this.

365
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:42,724
For a boy who can't swim
you were a fool to keep it.

366
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:43,691
Well

367
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,422
couldn't get rawhide loose.

368
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:47,661
But

369
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:49,213
you never know.

370
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,867
It might come in handy.

371
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:05,425
Youngstown, Ohio.

372
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:06,647
You?

373
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:08,750
Sikeston, Missouri.

374
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,751
Sikeston?

375
00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:11,856
Where's that?

376
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:13,287
Nowhere.

377
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:25,699
Pastula

378
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:27,635
Take another drift sight.

379
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:29,604
That's not how I'm reading those wave tops.

380
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:30,745
Yes, Chief.

381
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:32,774
15 degrees.

382
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,642
Same read as the outbound, Chief.

383
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:35,643
What?

384
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:48,156
If that's correct then she's
east. I had her west.

385
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:49,157
Aldrich?

386
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:51,326
Not a peep on the Hayrake.

387
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,829
I reckon you've flown us to
the middle of nowhere, Chief.

388
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,020
We're lost!

389
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:57,141
Say again, Aldrich?

390
00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,234
Aldrich!

391
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:05,607
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

392
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:09,411
That you have never had
a Kentucky Hot Brown?

393
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:14,348
So you're not allowed to eat
food from neighboring states?

394
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:15,349
No.

395
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:18,592
Glad I don't live in Ohio.

396
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:34,852
Ham and cheese.

397
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,231
Now you're talking.

398
00:25:37,507 --> 00:25:39,174
I must of made a 1000 of those

399
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:40,876
in the Civilian Conservation Corps.

400
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:41,877
The C's?

401
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:43,779
Me too. I cooked for
a hundred fellas.

402
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,060
Two cooks and no food.

403
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,684
So, how'd you end up Navy?

404
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:50,685
Well

405
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:53,555
a few too many mouths to feed at home.

406
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:55,724
My mother thought I could
become more disciplined.

407
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:56,658
Hm!

408
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:58,760
Imagine her disappointment.

409
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,529
And I was ready for an adventure

410
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,990
so I enlisted.

411
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,600
Well, you sure got an adventure!

412
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:07,402
Yeah. If my mother
could see me now.

413
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:08,403
Hm.

414
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:11,641
I wanna make it a career and

415
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,876
see the worid.

416
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:16,107
Career navy?
Good for you, son.

417
00:26:16,346 --> 00:26:21,436
In these troubled times
there is no higher calling.

418
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:27,456
You think it's possible we
get seen at night, Chief?

419
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:29,192
Wouldn't rule it out.

420
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:32,553
This yellow raft, moonlight might-

421
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:33,629
Well

422
00:26:33,697 --> 00:26:35,837
no full moon tonight.

423
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:38,768
We'll schedule a watch
anyway. Four on, eight off.

424
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:39,802
Who wants first up?

425
00:26:39,803 --> 00:26:41,223
I'll take it.

426
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:43,506
I can't sleep anyhow.

427
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:44,507
Alright.

428
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,139
I'll take second watch, Pastula.

429
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:49,809
Okay, chief.

430
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,910
Told me to rouse you up.

431
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:24,371
Reckon it's been about four hours.

432
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:26,549
See anything?

433
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,690
Just ocean.

434
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:41,497
Did you have anything to drink yet, Aldrich?

435
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:42,498
Drink?

436
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:43,567
What?

437
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,830
Oh, you gotta be kidding me, Chief!

438
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:28,745
Oh, tha-

439
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:34,846
That's just wonderful.

440
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Oh.

441
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:00,511
Watch?

442
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
Nothing.

443
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:06,285
Pretty steady breeze though.

444
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Henree!

445
00:29:10,056 --> 00:29:12,476
Time to put on the pot.

446
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:17,729
How long's the breeze been up?

447
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,531
Uh, an hour, maybe.

448
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:20,398
Same direction?

449
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,399
Uh-huh.

450
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:26,071
Chief?

451
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:27,072
Pastula.

452
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:30,343
Where are we?

453
00:29:35,547 --> 00:29:37,687
1900 miles to Hawaii.

454
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,050
Samoa's a 1000.

455
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,563
South America, 6000 at least.

456
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:44,889
That's a lot of zeroes.

457
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,358
But we are moving.

458
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,792
Flat bottom craft like this will sail

459
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:49,113
along smartly

460
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:53,708
and we've been getting some 12 knot winds.

461
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,974
A six-knot wind will give us a drift of one.

462
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:07,585
I bet we can get a two point five out of 12.

463
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:10,014
Although she sure does like
to change her mind though.

464
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:11,065
So Hawaii.

465
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:12,751
Yup.

466
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,954
How come you didn't point that way?

467
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:17,095
Dead ahead?

468
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:20,667
The way the wind's blowin' us now.

469
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:23,996
The Phoenix Islands.

470
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:25,317
The Gilberts.

471
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:26,465
Tarawa.

472
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
600 miles or less.

473
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,001
Tarawa?

474
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,137
Aren't there Jap subs out there?

475
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:32,071
Great.

476
00:30:32,072 --> 00:30:35,508
Jap army's crawling all
over those islands right now.

477
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,643
What happens if we land on a Jap island?

478
00:30:37,644 --> 00:30:39,564
Or a sub finds us?

479
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,581
There could be a sub
underneath us right now.

480
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:45,632
We would certainly be a prize.

481
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,454
But we have a chance.

482
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:49,989
All we need is some favorable winds

483
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,027
There are islands between
us and Samoa. 600 miles away.

484
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:58,164
Two knots or so...
I'd say a couple of weeks,

485
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:02,001
Could be a lot more
accurate if I had my chart.

486
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:04,872
We'll starve to death first!

487
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:08,673
Well...

488
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:12,478
Plenty of fish in the sea, right?

489
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:15,859
If only I had a hook and a line.

490
00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:19,218
Alright, Aldrich.
There's your line.

491
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:22,539
Some braided cord in that pocket.

492
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:27,451
Huh. And here.

493
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,129
Maybe if I can get one
of these magazines open

494
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,465
we can use one of those springs as a hook.

495
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,667
That could work just fine.

496
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:35,668
Alright.

497
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:40,907
You know what I could go for right now?

498
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:41,741
Come on.

499
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:42,742
Fish fry.

500
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,212
A nice deep-fried basket of cod.

501
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:47,481
A side of slaw and some potato salad.

502
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:49,583
Whole thing smothered in cheese.

503
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,584
Really?

504
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:53,653
Hey, there ain't nothing
that can't be improved

505
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:56,434
with a good slab of cheese.

506
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:58,527
There you go.

507
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,133
Alright.

508
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,028
How's that?

509
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,843
That ain't half bad.

510
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:18,304
Need a sinker.

511
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:39,266
Kinda looks like a piece of meat.

512
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,002
Well...

513
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:46,174
let's cast her off, alright.

514
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:50,137
Watch your eyes, there she goes!

515
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:52,211
Huh.

516
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,160
Whoa! That
was quick!

517
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:07,895
Come on, gimme a hand with this!

518
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:09,196
- Alright.
- Come here.

519
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:11,387
That's the way, boys!

520
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:19,707
Guess something down
there's hungrier than us.

521
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,848
Sweet Mary.

522
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,950
Here.

523
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,299
Put this on your head.

524
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:11,768
Suit yourself.

525
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:20,967
Hey!

526
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:22,426
What is it?

527
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:25,075
It's nothing.

528
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:28,944
For a second there I thought
I might be in line for a medal.

529
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:31,765
The Navy Cross or something.

530
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:35,050
Then I realized there's not much
heroic about sitting in a raft and

531
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:36,251
starving to death.

532
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:37,572
Navy Cross...

533
00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:40,889
We'll be lucky if we
don't get charged the cost

534
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,157
of a new plane.

535
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:43,158
Aw, heck.

536
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,062
It isn't anybody's fault, right?

537
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:49,998
Perfectly good torpedo
bomber lying on the bottom

538
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,369
of the ocean.

539
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:56,411
Sounds like it's got to be somebody's fault.

540
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:03,302
Damn fish aren't biting.

541
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,320
Whoa, whoa.

542
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,416
Where are you going?

543
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:09,283
There ain't no fish.

544
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:12,564
Which means there ain't no food.

545
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:17,206
I can't take the heat no more.

546
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:19,694
Yahhh!

547
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,735
Come on in, boys!
Water's fine!

548
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:28,136
No, no, one at a time.

549
00:35:28,137 --> 00:35:30,338
It's 2,000 to Hawaii, you said?

550
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:31,907
Don't get too far, Aldrich.

551
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:33,041
This boat's moving, you know!

552
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:36,044
Real live bait out there now, huh, Chief?

553
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:37,913
That's another problem.

554
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:38,914
Sharks?

555
00:35:39,048 --> 00:35:40,882
I don't know if they'd attack.

556
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:42,718
I've heard arguments both ways.

557
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,769
Hey, Gene!

558
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:47,344
Chief's wondering about sharks.

559
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,059
Ah, jeez!

560
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,144
Where are you going?

561
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:05,141
Just a few more

562
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:06,822
strokes, Aldrich.

563
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:20,156
We need to

564
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:21,457
stay with the raft.

565
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,226
I think if we hang onto
the sides we'll be safe.

566
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:24,527
The others can stand guard.

567
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:28,164
It did get the blood pumpin', though.

568
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:30,305
Pastula? You're next.

569
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:34,309
No, thanks.

570
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:39,008
That's why you gotta do it last.

571
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:41,110
Because if you broil
it for too long, well...

572
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:46,441
And if you go too short,
it's not gonna melt evenly.

573
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:53,389
It's beautiful, isn't it?

574
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,950
It'd be better if we could eat it.

575
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,001
I was doing alright, see?

576
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:06,537
I didn't expect no A.

577
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:08,172
This the mechanic's course?

578
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:09,506
No, it was another one.

579
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:10,507
Oh.

580
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,376
I thought I ought to get a B or

581
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:15,145
anyways a C and that
would've been all right.

582
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,347
You know, I never really cared
about making the best marks

583
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:19,149
in school, as long as I learned the stuff.

584
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,150
Uh-hm.

585
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:24,120
And I had this course down good.

586
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:27,958
When I saw that report card
and saw that big shiny F

587
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,294
I just said the hell with this bull crap.

588
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,062
Excuse my language.

589
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,031
So what did you do?

590
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,033
I just walked out of school and

591
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:39,570
And you had that course
down good, you reckon?

592
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:41,081
You bet I did!

593
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:46,943
But I'm assuming you aced
that mechanic's course.

594
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:48,478
Ah, did well enough, Chief.

595
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,759
So you could

596
00:37:49,848 --> 00:37:51,215
dismantle and reassemble a drift sight

597
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:54,283
much less take a reading on one.

598
00:37:54,284 --> 00:37:55,919
Yeah, guess I could.

599
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Yeah?

600
00:37:58,089 --> 00:37:59,990
Just strange, that's all.

601
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,458
I had us headed west.

602
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:03,026
Your sighting corrected us east

603
00:38:03,027 --> 00:38:04,461
You asked for confirmation
and he gave it you.

604
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:09,232
I'm discussing this with
my bombardier, Aldrich.

605
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,304
I know you confirmed it.

606
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:18,635
I'm just saying, it's strange, that's all.

607
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,840
Okay, Chief.

608
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:27,239
Strange alright.

609
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:58,181
Henree!

610
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:00,684
Put on the pot!

611
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,690
Pastula?

612
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,045
Ain't there a rule

613
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:47,165
a guy can have a handful and still be okay?

614
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:52,306
Sucks the water right out
of your brains, they say.

615
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:54,941
Coming up on 120 hours.

616
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:59,232
Five days, not a sip.

617
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,649
How come we ain't dead?

618
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,470
We've been soaking ourselves

619
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,320
not moving around too much.

620
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,254
A couple shoes full

621
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:11,023
of the yellow stuff.

622
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,664
While it lasted.

623
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:20,432
Not even a rudder.

624
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,601
But you know where you want us to go.

625
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:23,635
Right, Chief?

626
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:26,186
I know, but to calculate-

627
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:28,406
Ahh!

628
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:30,274
Chief?

629
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:36,481
A pencil

630
00:40:37,117 --> 00:40:38,117
A pencil?

631
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,485
A gol' darned ever-lovin' pencil!

632
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:41,620
You see that?

633
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:43,631
I can make a chart!

634
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:02,073
Pastula

635
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:03,308
you said east

636
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:04,476
two to three knots

637
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:05,477
on your watch, huh?

638
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:06,378
Uh-huh.

639
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:07,379
Aldrich

640
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,290
more like southeast

641
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:10,315
two to three?

642
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:12,086
Yeah. Affirmative.

643
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:16,505
Okay then.

644
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:18,792
Here we are

645
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,560
by dead reckoning.

646
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,611
But where we headed?

647
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:24,926
With luck, right here.

648
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:28,535
There's a chain of 'em to our south-west.

649
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:29,536
Closest friendly land

650
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:31,087
in the Pacific.

651
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,708
Now if this favorable wind
will just push us there.

652
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:38,778
What if it just keeps shifting, Chief?

653
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:41,513
Chart don't take us nowhere.

654
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:42,514
Unless...

655
00:41:47,187 --> 00:41:51,557
Unless we can hold our
position in the headwind.

656
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:52,492
Aldrich!

657
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,403
Untie the handrail.

658
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:55,694
Pastula

659
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:58,331
I need you to take some of that wire

660
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:00,233
and you make a frame

661
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:03,335
to keep this from folding up in the water.

662
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:04,437
Can you do it?

663
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,898
You bet chief.

664
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:14,139
Leave one end tied.

665
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,782
Okay.

666
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:19,524
Okay, good.

667
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,093
Here, hold him up.
Hold him up.

668
00:43:01,228 --> 00:43:02,228
Perfect!

669
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:04,184
That, sailors

670
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:06,922
is a sea anchor.

671
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,769
We may not be able to control the wind

672
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,738
but we can avoid being blown the wrong way.

673
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:11,739
Huh!

674
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,807
That's nice work, Chief.

675
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,376
Now I'll be yelling

676
00:43:15,377 --> 00:43:16,377
Henree!

677
00:43:16,444 --> 00:43:17,645
Put on the brake!

678
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:21,196
Whoo! Look at 'er
grab that water!

679
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:25,719
Hey, Tony, look!

680
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,589
I'll be danged if I don't see
a tear of joy on old Chief!

681
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,658
He said we were too dried up for that.

682
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:32,660
Why, I do believe you're right.

683
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:35,121
Really? You
saw a tear?

684
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:46,931
Okay, let off the brake!

685
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:11,307
Men, it isn't easy.

686
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:14,213
But it might be worse.

687
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,304
If we can keep this wind

688
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,772
and just get a little rain.

689
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:19,773
Well

690
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:24,567
it never hurt to ask.

691
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:29,850
Dear Lord

692
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:31,885
Gene!

693
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:33,722
The only prayers I know are in Polish.

694
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:36,992
I hadn't marked you for
a church-going man, Aldrich.

695
00:44:36,993 --> 00:44:40,923
I'm sorry to say I'm not much of one.

696
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:44,815
That's alright.

697
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:47,084
Just follow my lead.

698
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:51,372
Dear Lord

699
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:55,876
we know we ain't always done right by you.

700
00:44:55,877 --> 00:44:57,946
We're askin' for a little help here

701
00:44:57,947 --> 00:44:59,767
during this trial.

702
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:02,473
If it so pleases you.

703
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:08,756
Uh...

704
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:10,891
And, Lord

705
00:45:13,895 --> 00:45:14,945
watch over

706
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:18,300
all the men back on our ship.

707
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:20,636
And all the ships at sea

708
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:22,547
including this one.

709
00:45:26,342 --> 00:45:27,342
Tony?

710
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:34,883
Dear God

711
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:40,139
I'll go along with what the other guys said

712
00:45:40,456 --> 00:45:41,506
but mostly

713
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:45,185
we need some rain, Lord.

714
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:47,669
Rain, dear Lord.

715
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:49,365
Please, rain.

716
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:50,366
Please.

717
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:51,467
Amen.

718
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,820
Oh, come on!

719
00:45:59,543 --> 00:46:03,678
Give him a second.
He's got to cook it up.

720
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:04,819
Or maybe...

721
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:46,341
That's a good one.

722
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:49,999
Hey, Chief.

723
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:51,341
You got one?

724
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:55,097
Uh...

725
00:47:08,613 --> 00:47:09,753
Big finish!

726
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:21,955
What's wrong?

727
00:48:22,753 --> 00:48:23,753
Nothing.

728
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:37,601
Hey...

729
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,840
Hey! Hey!

730
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,244
Battle stations boys!

731
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:48,546
We've got precipitation!

732
00:48:48,547 --> 00:48:50,248
I've got the bag.

733
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:51,282
Here it comes.

734
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:53,703
Get as much as you can!

735
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:26,618
Looks like your prayers worked, Aldrich!

736
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:28,153
You're going to have to thank Sunday School

737
00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:31,244
at First Baptist Church, Chief!

738
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:07,359
C'mon you stupid fish.

739
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,729
Haven't you ever seen a fishing line before?

740
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,600
A week of nothing.

741
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:17,803
By golly, Aldrich, you are
the most patient fisherman

742
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:19,404
I've ever seen.

743
00:50:19,806 --> 00:50:21,586
Where I come from

744
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:25,248
you don't catch, you don't eat.

745
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:31,882
Just going about this
the wrong way, that's all.

746
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:36,465
Knife in your pocket like I told you.

747
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:38,857
If you put a hole in this raft...

748
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:40,325
If we don't eat soon

749
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:42,861
we might just as well, Chief.

750
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:43,862
Aldrich

751
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,165
you stow that knife.
That's an order!

752
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:48,801
If you don't catch

753
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:50,312
you don't eat.

754
00:50:52,805 --> 00:50:53,805
Aldrich...

755
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:55,642
I hit one!

756
00:50:55,643 --> 00:50:56,643
Stop it!

757
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:00,645
I hit the raft!

758
00:51:01,048 --> 00:51:02,598
God! You idiot!

759
00:51:02,716 --> 00:51:03,716
Don't move.

760
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:05,118
I'll get the cement!

761
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,819
It ain't the raft, Chief!

762
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,820
Oh, shit!

763
00:51:08,388 --> 00:51:09,388
Pastula!

764
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:10,723
Ahhhhh!

765
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:12,554
Don't let him go!

766
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:26,792
I think I got it.
I think I got it.

767
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,413
Nice work, Pastula.

768
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:34,964
Atta boy, Tony.

769
00:51:35,748 --> 00:51:38,168
It fell out of the sky.

770
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:42,171
A shark just fell out of the sky.

771
00:51:46,426 --> 00:51:47,426
Oh!

772
00:51:51,297 --> 00:51:52,297
Ah, geez!

773
00:52:00,006 --> 00:52:03,146
Looks like she just had dinner!

774
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:31,721
We've got bait for another day or two.

775
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:34,941
Probably some for an extra meal as well.

776
00:52:34,942 --> 00:52:36,376
The salt will keep it.

777
00:52:36,377 --> 00:52:38,445
How far we got to those islands, Chief?

778
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,980
According to the chart

779
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:41,211
roughly 390.

780
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,252
Wind's out of the northeast
which is just right for us.

781
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:46,987
And if she switches on us, we just

782
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:48,055
throw on the brake.

783
00:52:48,056 --> 00:52:49,556
No backsliding.

784
00:52:50,324 --> 00:52:51,859
We're going home.

785
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,161
And boy will my wife be sore.

786
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:59,032
Damn. I thought he was
only married to the Navy.

787
00:53:01,235 --> 00:53:02,970
Neither of you boys are married?

788
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:03,971
Nope.

789
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:07,306
I got a girl back in Youngstown.

790
00:53:07,307 --> 00:53:08,307
Irene.

791
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,376
Not me.

792
00:53:09,377 --> 00:53:10,377
But...

793
00:53:10,445 --> 00:53:11,979
I'd like to someday.

794
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,080
Hey, I got a sister.

795
00:53:14,115 --> 00:53:15,149
You two would get along.

796
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,290
No kidding.

797
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,174
What's she like?

798
00:53:18,253 --> 00:53:19,673
I don't know.

799
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:21,822
People say she's like me.

800
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,556
It's not much

801
00:53:22,557 --> 00:53:23,524
of an advertisement

802
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:24,525
Pastula.

803
00:53:24,859 --> 00:53:27,194
She don't look like me.

804
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:29,798
She's, you know, easy to get along with.

805
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:32,579
And a lot prettier than me.

806
00:53:33,401 --> 00:53:35,069
Describe her to me.

807
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,070
Really?

808
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,824
Yeah, really.

809
00:53:40,976 --> 00:53:42,026
Five-four.

810
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:43,954
She's got

811
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,629
long brown hair

812
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:47,554
green eyes.

813
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,219
This is kind of weird, Gene.

814
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,360
Keep goin'.

815
00:53:53,955 --> 00:53:56,785
She's a wiz in the kitchen.

816
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:58,828
She likes to read.

817
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
She wears

818
00:54:00,296 --> 00:54:01,296
clothes

819
00:54:02,932 --> 00:54:04,332
She wears clothes?

820
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,301
Well, I should certainly hope so.

821
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:08,002
Clothes are not a requirement in my book.

822
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:09,003
Hey!

823
00:54:09,138 --> 00:54:10,438
That's my sister you're talking about!

824
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:12,073
And when we get through this

825
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:13,575
I'll thank you for setting me up with her.

826
00:54:13,576 --> 00:54:15,396
She sounds lovely.

827
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,047
Uhh!

828
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,869
We got company.

829
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:29,290
Must be all the blood in the water.

830
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:32,893
I've heard they can smell it for miles.

831
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,404
What do we do?

832
00:54:35,197 --> 00:54:37,017
Well, for starters

833
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:41,262
I say we cancel the swimming program.

834
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,210
Ah! Ah! Ah!

835
00:55:34,256 --> 00:55:35,224
What's the matter?!

836
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:36,325
I got bit!

837
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:40,029
Cease fire!

838
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,170
CEASE FIRE!

839
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,067
Let me see, let me see.

840
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:46,068
Oh, geez.

841
00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:48,704
Three teeth marks at least.

842
00:55:48,705 --> 00:55:50,673
One nail's ripped off.

843
00:55:50,674 --> 00:55:51,674
Oh, Gene.

844
00:55:52,942 --> 00:55:54,172
Here, Chief.

845
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:58,580
Well, I've heard of fishing by hand

846
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:00,811
but that's ridiculous!

847
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:05,634
We'll get a better look
at it in the morning.

848
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:10,179
- Keep pressure on it.
- Okay.

849
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,980
What do they call us, Chief?

850
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:31,013
What?

851
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:34,745
"Missing in action" or

852
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:36,051
what?

853
00:56:40,024 --> 00:56:41,304
Lost at sea.

854
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:45,006
That's how they carried us.

855
00:56:45,729 --> 00:56:47,009
Lost at sea.

856
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:52,409
No trace of aircraft or personnel was found.

857
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:29,616
Our father

858
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,735
who art in heaven

859
00:58:31,736 --> 00:58:33,876
hallowed by thy name.

860
00:58:34,205 --> 00:58:35,406
Thy kingdom come

861
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:36,474
thy will be done

862
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,615
on earth...

863
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,420
Tony.

864
01:00:29,388 --> 01:00:30,890
Give me the gun.

865
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:31,891
Huh?

866
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:33,769
Give it to me.

867
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,298
Oh, Gene. I wasn't...

868
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:40,299
Shhhh!

869
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:43,147
Wanna eat or not?

870
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:02,088
I got him!

871
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:03,829
Great shot!

872
01:01:04,258 --> 01:01:05,358
I got him!

873
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:09,501
Hey, Chief.

874
01:01:16,836 --> 01:01:17,837
Atta boy, Chief!

875
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:19,388
Come on, Chief!

876
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:21,896
You got it.

877
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:24,406
Good work, Chief.

878
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:28,813
Oh, shit!

879
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:29,815
What's that?

880
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:31,726
Double time, Chief!

881
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:33,435
Come on, Chief!

882
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:39,991
Ohh...

883
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:42,829
The slide's jammed!

884
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,830
What? No!

885
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:45,799
Come on!

886
01:01:49,636 --> 01:01:53,072
- Fast, Chief!
- Paddle, paddle, paddle!

887
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:54,073
Come on!

888
01:01:54,474 --> 01:01:55,909
Come on, Chief!

889
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:56,910
Come on!

890
01:01:59,946 --> 01:02:02,176
Almost there! Come on!

891
01:02:11,925 --> 01:02:14,435
Look at the size of him!

892
01:02:35,082 --> 01:02:36,182
Ain't bad.

893
01:02:37,551 --> 01:02:38,885
Could use cheese.

894
01:02:38,886 --> 01:02:39,886
Huh?

895
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:43,671
It could use cheese.

896
01:02:44,558 --> 01:02:46,558
Tastes like chicken.

897
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:47,857
Raw chicken.

898
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:53,934
So I thought when you saw a bird

899
01:02:53,935 --> 01:02:56,625
it means you're near land.

900
01:02:56,737 --> 01:02:58,197
Not this bird.

901
01:02:58,573 --> 01:02:59,623
They range

902
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:01,684
thousands of miles.

903
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:06,847
I still can't believe you shot an albatross.

904
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:07,848
Why?

905
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,090
Never mind.

906
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,643
Tony, c'mon.
Eat up.

907
01:04:11,479 --> 01:04:13,399
I don't blame you.

908
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:16,922
I'd leave if I could, too.

909
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,132
Pastula, take another drift sight.

910
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:34,553
That's not how I'm reading those wave-tops.

911
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:35,970
Pastula?

912
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:42,910
Aldrich!

913
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:44,680
We've lost Pastula!

914
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,615
...nowhere,
Chief. We're lost.

915
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:47,616
Aldrich!

916
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,142
Enterprise!

917
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:56,825
No, check that! 6-Tare-14
requesting an inbound bearing!

918
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:58,276
...Enterprise..

919
01:04:58,695 --> 01:04:59,785
Enterprise!

920
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,864
Enterprise! Help me!

921
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,899
There's no watch.

922
01:05:34,129 --> 01:05:35,999
All hands on deck.

923
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,103
I gave orders

924
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:42,706
to maintain a 24-hour watch.

925
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:44,673
And you're sleeping on duty!

926
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,174
What difference does it make?

927
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,011
If that wind shifts

928
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:50,580
and we don't deploy our anchor

929
01:05:50,581 --> 01:05:52,649
we lose ground, Aldrich!

930
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,883
I don't feel any wind, Chief.

931
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:54,984
It's because their ain't any.

932
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:56,185
It's been dead for two days.

933
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:57,220
Shut your mouth!

934
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:59,361
Just shut your mouth!

935
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,726
I ordered a watch, there will be a watch!

936
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:05,957
Sure, Chief.

937
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,493
Whatever you say.

938
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,676
No you won't, Tony.

939
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,169
You want a damn watch so bad

940
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,871
why don't you sit here staring at nothing

941
01:06:14,872 --> 01:06:15,805
all day?

942
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:17,316
I do my share.

943
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:21,461
Are you? Then where
are these islands

944
01:06:23,314 --> 01:06:25,180
you told us about?

945
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:26,181
Yeah.

946
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,318
They must be close, right?

947
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,509
Don't you touch that!

948
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:34,724
You boys, you can't even
swim much less read a map!

949
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:37,060
Let me ask you something.

950
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:38,962
How'd you come up with
that chart of yours anyway?

951
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:42,932
I- I-I studied the area map
in the ready room every day.

952
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:44,200
I have a rough picture of it

953
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:45,001
in my mind.

954
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:46,035
Plus or minus 10%

955
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:49,856
After that it's simple dead reckoning!

956
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:51,341
A rough picture?

957
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:52,809
Dead reckoning works when you know

958
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,979
where you're starting from, right?

959
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,615
So this route you've figured

960
01:06:58,616 --> 01:07:00,950
is based on where you think we went down

961
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:02,352
followed by a bunch of estimates

962
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:03,820
after that on where we've

963
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:04,754
gotten each day.

964
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:05,688
What's your point?

965
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:06,739
My point?!

966
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,060
The reason we went down is because

967
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:11,629
you didn't know where we were

968
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:14,965
That's why we couldn't find the ship.

969
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:16,100
That's why I couldn't

970
01:07:16,101 --> 01:07:18,102
raise her on the radio.

971
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:21,038
You had gotten us so far
off, we were out of range!

972
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,706
I- I tried to take that into account.

973
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:23,707
And that's with instruments

974
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,308
and a real map!

975
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:27,978
And here we've gone all
these days without so much

976
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:33,029
And the first couple of
days we hardly kept track.

977
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:39,684
And you're gonna put us on some teeny
islands in the middle of all this?

978
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:40,823
I, I...

979
01:07:41,026 --> 01:07:42,626
All a big guess

980
01:07:43,161 --> 01:07:48,621
Now, listen. Yes, yes, yes,
I'm relying on my recall.

981
01:07:49,134 --> 01:07:51,402
I may have made a few estimates, but I-

982
01:07:51,403 --> 01:07:53,003
I was trying to

983
01:07:53,238 --> 01:07:55,005
head us dead center to these islands

984
01:07:55,006 --> 01:07:56,874
so even if we were off somewhat

985
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,976
What do you mean
"was trying?"

986
01:07:59,977 --> 01:08:03,617
When were you expecting to see them?

987
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,307
Three days ago.

988
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:18,261
Or four.

989
01:08:20,064 --> 01:08:24,614
There should be islands
all around us by now.

990
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,862
We missed 'em.

991
01:08:31,443 --> 01:08:32,903
We missed 'em.

992
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,716
That's the way islands are, Tony.

993
01:08:37,717 --> 01:08:40,285
Didn't you know? You raise
'em and they're past.

994
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:44,122
It's a one chance deal. You
miss Hawaii, next stop Tokio.

995
01:08:44,123 --> 01:08:45,457
Now, you listen to me...

996
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:46,958
It's dead reckoning alright

997
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:49,060
'cause I reckon we're dead out here!

998
01:08:49,061 --> 01:08:50,428
You want to take over

999
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:51,659
smart mouth?

1000
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:52,897
Guys, please.

1001
01:08:52,898 --> 01:08:54,999
I don't give a goddamn!

1002
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,001
And you're mister high and mighty.

1003
01:08:58,002 --> 01:09:00,805
Keeping your shoes after
we've thrown ours away.

1004
01:09:00,806 --> 01:09:05,036
About the radio like I'd missed somethin'!

1005
01:09:06,344 --> 01:09:07,278
"What did

1006
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,247
Aldrich do with the radio?"

1007
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:12,283
You're all over Tony about his drift sight

1008
01:09:12,284 --> 01:09:16,019
because he got the same read on both legs.

1009
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,355
Well, what the hell

1010
01:09:17,356 --> 01:09:21,960
besides getting us lost on
the biggest body of water

1011
01:09:21,961 --> 01:09:22,894
in the whole

1012
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:23,495
damn

1013
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:24,496
worid?

1014
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:30,049
Chief?
I've lost the beacon, over.

1015
01:09:30,368 --> 01:09:32,418
Are we close, Chief?

1016
01:09:34,139 --> 01:09:36,441
Maybe his comm is down.

1017
01:09:36,442 --> 01:09:38,592
I'll give him a tap.

1018
01:09:39,477 --> 01:09:40,477
Chief?

1019
01:09:40,913 --> 01:09:43,181
Can you hear us, over?

1020
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:45,049
Loud and clear, boys.

1021
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,484
Just waiting for this wind to tell me which

1022
01:09:46,485 --> 01:09:48,765
way she wants to blow.

1023
01:09:56,962 --> 01:09:59,242
I think I fell asleep.

1024
01:10:05,137 --> 01:10:06,557
It was so hot

1025
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:12,690
It couldn't have been more
than a couple minutes but...

1026
01:10:16,582 --> 01:10:18,772
So we missed the turn

1027
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,588
and by the time that we made it...

1028
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:24,689
It was way too late.

1029
01:10:31,463 --> 01:10:32,973
I got us lost.

1030
01:10:36,902 --> 01:10:39,405
And I don't know how to
square it with you boys.

1031
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,406
Ever.

1032
01:10:41,141 --> 01:10:42,141
I can't.

1033
01:10:45,611 --> 01:10:46,851
I'm a pilot

1034
01:10:48,314 --> 01:10:49,594
who lost his

1035
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:50,916
plane

1036
01:10:52,418 --> 01:10:53,968
and his crew...

1037
01:10:56,355 --> 01:10:57,495
And myself.

1038
01:11:02,996 --> 01:11:04,956
I'm terribly sorry-

1039
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:10,593
I'm terribly sorry, men.

1040
01:11:13,272 --> 01:11:14,372
I'm sorry.

1041
01:11:54,514 --> 01:11:56,614
This map ain't much.

1042
01:12:02,188 --> 01:12:06,978
But it's the only thing
we got to get us home.

1043
01:12:16,536 --> 01:12:18,638
Looks like the only wind we're generating

1044
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:20,073
is our own, fellas.

1045
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:21,354
I reckon so.

1046
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:25,876
That Is exactly what we need to do!

1047
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,481
Where are my shoes?

1048
01:12:28,482 --> 01:12:30,082
Oh, here we go.

1049
01:12:30,284 --> 01:12:31,284
No, no.

1050
01:12:33,386 --> 01:12:35,346
Give me your knife.

1051
01:12:35,723 --> 01:12:38,363
Please give me your knife.

1052
01:12:57,278 --> 01:12:58,278
Okay.

1053
01:13:09,357 --> 01:13:10,357
Gentlemen.

1054
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:14,569
Let's make our own wind.

1055
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:29,343
Tell you what...

1056
01:13:29,344 --> 01:13:32,613
Whoever sees land first, gets a dinner.

1057
01:13:32,614 --> 01:13:35,082
Anything he wants, anywhere he wants.

1058
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,317
The other two are buying.

1059
01:13:36,318 --> 01:13:37,318
Deal!

1060
01:13:38,053 --> 01:13:39,053
Stroke!

1061
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:44,909
You won't find that funny in a few minutes!

1062
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:18,325
Henree!

1063
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:22,329
Put on

1064
01:14:23,665 --> 01:14:24,665
the pot.

1065
01:14:44,519 --> 01:14:45,519
Okay

1066
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:48,296
let's get to it.

1067
01:14:52,861 --> 01:14:53,861
Gene?

1068
01:15:19,888 --> 01:15:21,258
Either of you

1069
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:23,225
know insurance?

1070
01:15:25,895 --> 01:15:26,895
Insurance?

1071
01:15:28,265 --> 01:15:29,765
Life insurance.

1072
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:35,981
I have a $5,000 policy to go to my mother.

1073
01:15:36,607 --> 01:15:40,542
Was Wondering if she was able to collect.

1074
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:42,378
After a whole month

1075
01:15:42,379 --> 01:15:43,979
I'd imagine so.

1076
01:15:44,214 --> 01:15:45,214
I wonder

1077
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:47,350
how Irene's getting along.

1078
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:50,311
Sounds like a real nice girl.

1079
01:15:53,623 --> 01:15:56,403
She works for a doctor now.

1080
01:15:56,627 --> 01:15:58,087
You said that.

1081
01:15:59,228 --> 01:16:02,008
I used to write her poetry.

1082
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:05,167
We'd sure like to hear one of those poems.

1083
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:06,538
That's right.

1084
01:16:08,838 --> 01:16:10,438
Give us a poem.

1085
01:16:16,879 --> 01:16:17,879
Tony?

1086
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:09,361
Look alive, boys.

1087
01:17:09,767 --> 01:17:12,637
We might be getting a drink.

1088
01:17:13,303 --> 01:17:15,313
It's a strange one.

1089
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,440
Earhart.

1090
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:19,276
You know that woman flier?

1091
01:17:19,277 --> 01:17:20,777
Amelia Earhart.

1092
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:26,019
She went down in these parts, right?

1093
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,811
Here it comes!

1094
01:17:57,014 --> 01:17:58,654
That was chilly.

1095
01:18:19,637 --> 01:18:21,137
Another shower?

1096
01:18:22,674 --> 01:18:24,042
I don't like it.

1097
01:18:24,043 --> 01:18:25,343
The clouds are movin'

1098
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:26,911
in opposite directions.

1099
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:28,012
What is it?

1100
01:18:28,013 --> 01:18:29,063
Get ready.

1101
01:18:29,081 --> 01:18:32,501
We're going to have to bail fast.

1102
01:18:38,656 --> 01:18:40,992
Are there hurricanes in the Pacific?

1103
01:18:40,993 --> 01:18:42,173
Affirmative.

1104
01:18:43,394 --> 01:18:46,124
So when's hurricane season?

1105
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:51,662
Why do I keep asking these questions?

1106
01:18:59,377 --> 01:19:00,427
Take this!

1107
01:19:01,413 --> 01:19:03,963
You can't swim, remember?

1108
01:19:08,419 --> 01:19:10,888
You know what I could go for right now?

1109
01:19:10,889 --> 01:19:11,889
Get down!

1110
01:19:15,093 --> 01:19:16,413
Chief! Chief!

1111
01:19:17,062 --> 01:19:18,342
Where is he?

1112
01:19:19,965 --> 01:19:20,965
Chief!

1113
01:19:24,702 --> 01:19:26,704
We're coming,
Chief! Come on!

1114
01:19:26,705 --> 01:19:28,255
Come on, Chief!

1115
01:19:38,684 --> 01:19:39,684
STAY

1116
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:40,519
WITH

1117
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,520
THE RAFT!

1118
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:44,989
HANG ON!

1119
01:20:05,577 --> 01:20:07,537
Gene! Where's Tony?

1120
01:20:07,814 --> 01:20:09,004
I lost him!

1121
01:20:17,456 --> 01:20:21,427
Work your way around.
See if you can spot him!

1122
01:20:21,428 --> 01:20:22,428
Tony!

1123
01:20:27,733 --> 01:20:28,733
Tony!

1124
01:20:29,668 --> 01:20:30,668
Tony!

1125
01:20:36,074 --> 01:20:38,844
Zdrowas Maryjo, laskis pelna

1126
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:45,650
You okay?

1127
01:20:45,718 --> 01:20:47,038
Chief! Chief!

1128
01:20:49,622 --> 01:20:50,622
Good boy.

1129
01:20:57,664 --> 01:20:58,664
Alright

1130
01:20:58,866 --> 01:21:00,966
we have to flip her!

1131
01:21:01,468 --> 01:21:02,568
On my mark

1132
01:21:03,237 --> 01:21:04,137
we'll lift

1133
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:05,872
and let the wind catch her.

1134
01:21:05,873 --> 01:21:07,540
But hold onto it.

1135
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:08,174
Yeah!

1136
01:21:08,175 --> 01:21:09,175
One!

1137
01:21:09,209 --> 01:21:10,209
Two!

1138
01:21:10,211 --> 01:21:11,211
Three!

1139
01:21:11,545 --> 01:21:12,545
Lift!

1140
01:21:16,683 --> 01:21:19,643
You go around the other side!

1141
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,750
I'll hold it down!
You get in first!

1142
01:21:36,102 --> 01:21:37,102
Lock on!

1143
01:22:03,296 --> 01:22:04,716
Rub-a-dub-dub

1144
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,310
Three men in a tub.

1145
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:12,612
And who do you think they be?

1146
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:16,744
The butcher, the baker

1147
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:18,925
the candlestick maker.

1148
01:22:19,747 --> 01:22:21,117
Turn them out

1149
01:22:21,182 --> 01:22:22,912
knaves all three.

1150
01:22:24,252 --> 01:22:28,492
How is it I just now thought of that one?

1151
01:22:29,323 --> 01:22:31,013
The raft'll sink

1152
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,570
won't it?

1153
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:36,930
Yeah.

1154
01:22:39,099 --> 01:22:42,289
There'll be nothing left of us.

1155
01:22:44,271 --> 01:22:45,271
No.

1156
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:52,265
No one will know we've
survived all this time.

1157
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:53,279
No.

1158
01:22:56,817 --> 01:22:59,187
Suppose one of us dies.

1159
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:03,603
What do the others do?

1160
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:07,962
Gene, you're always talking about food.

1161
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:09,833
What do you think?

1162
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:11,850
The liver, anyhow.

1163
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:15,268
The heart if you can get to it.

1164
01:23:15,269 --> 01:23:17,729
Well, we lost the pliers

1165
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:19,873
and your pocket knife.

1166
01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:21,208
Well, the kidneys

1167
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:22,669
would be easy.

1168
01:23:23,978 --> 01:23:26,348
Yeah, one for each man.

1169
01:23:31,885 --> 01:23:33,154
I think we need some

1170
01:23:33,155 --> 01:23:35,115
other kind of talk.

1171
01:23:35,324 --> 01:23:39,424
I'm trying but everything's so far away.

1172
01:23:41,363 --> 01:23:43,723
Just remember something.

1173
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:47,968
My wife.

1174
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,790
She had a pretty yellow dress.

1175
01:23:56,411 --> 01:24:00,781
She burned a hole in it with her cigarette.

1176
01:24:01,182 --> 01:24:05,962
So she sewed a little
white dove over the hole.

1177
01:24:06,722 --> 01:24:08,723
I can picture the dress

1178
01:24:08,724 --> 01:24:10,004
and the dove

1179
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:16,391
but I can't really see her face.

1180
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:32,713
Tony?

1181
01:24:37,752 --> 01:24:41,188
I do believe I am in love with your sister.

1182
01:24:41,189 --> 01:24:42,189
Huh.

1183
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:47,139
You'll make a great couple.

1184
01:24:50,398 --> 01:24:52,818
I want you boys to know

1185
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:55,298
if we had made it

1186
01:24:56,139 --> 01:25:00,189
I would've put you in for commendations.

1187
01:25:00,343 --> 01:25:03,979
If they would've listened
to me after my court martial.

1188
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,390
Court martial?

1189
01:25:07,283 --> 01:25:08,283
Pastula

1190
01:25:09,419 --> 01:25:13,122
can you think of anything they'd
be court martialing the Chief for?

1191
01:25:13,123 --> 01:25:16,813
Not a thing I can think of, Aldrich.

1192
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:18,333
Me neither.

1193
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:23,799
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

1194
01:25:28,105 --> 01:25:30,385
A man plots his course

1195
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:34,581
but the Lord decides.

1196
01:25:57,833 --> 01:25:58,833
Alright.

1197
01:26:01,504 --> 01:26:03,914
Enough of that bullshit!

1198
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,731
Seems to me

1199
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:12,449
if God chose our course

1200
01:26:13,449 --> 01:26:17,189
it's because he wants us to make it!

1201
01:26:18,889 --> 01:26:19,889
Right?

1202
01:26:24,961 --> 01:26:26,011
Either way

1203
01:26:28,865 --> 01:26:32,835
we've come way too far to give up now.

1204
01:26:46,883 --> 01:26:47,883
Ahh.

1205
01:27:43,307 --> 01:27:44,307
Tony.

1206
01:27:47,945 --> 01:27:48,945
Tony.

1207
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,026
Gene?

1208
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:17,057
Poor Tony.

1209
01:28:25,516 --> 01:28:26,516
Uh.

1210
01:28:28,119 --> 01:28:29,119
Tony.

1211
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:37,897
I hear music.

1212
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:41,400
What kind of music

1213
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,400
Tony?

1214
01:28:43,602 --> 01:28:45,292
Can you hear it?

1215
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:55,523
I see a beautiful field of corn.

1216
01:28:57,315 --> 01:28:59,235
I- I saw our fleet

1217
01:29:00,519 --> 01:29:02,109
twice yesterday.

1218
01:29:26,378 --> 01:29:27,798
I don't know.

1219
01:29:28,647 --> 01:29:30,237
Somethin' green.

1220
01:29:33,018 --> 01:29:34,978
Have a look, Chief.

1221
01:30:04,549 --> 01:30:05,869
Gene Aldrich.

1222
01:30:06,519 --> 01:30:09,659
You have won yourself a dinner!

1223
01:30:17,696 --> 01:30:18,696
Land ho!

1224
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:25,070
Land ho!

1225
01:30:31,778 --> 01:30:32,828
Thank you.

1226
01:30:33,746 --> 01:30:34,796
Thank you.

1227
01:30:35,049 --> 01:30:37,139
Paddle, boys. Paddle!

1228
01:30:40,253 --> 01:30:41,253
Paddle!

1229
01:30:59,472 --> 01:31:00,612
Stand down.

1230
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:06,160
We should drift right in.

1231
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:15,769
What if there's Japanese?

1232
01:31:16,656 --> 01:31:19,026
What choice do we have?

1233
01:31:21,828 --> 01:31:23,558
Square away, men.

1234
01:31:23,597 --> 01:31:25,967
We might be going over.

1235
01:31:35,842 --> 01:31:37,532
It's going over!

1236
01:32:50,617 --> 01:32:51,617
Uh!
