1
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:11,159
<i>Our next story is about love.</i>

2
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:18,199
<i>"LOVE" is an exhibition by the young</i>

3
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,999
<i>but established artist
Ugljesa Rackovic.</i>

4
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:24,167
<i>His latest display in the
Center for Cultural Decontamination</i>

5
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:27,496
<i>triggered heated
reactions in Belgrade.</i>

6
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:30,191
<i>My guest is
the National Museum curator,</i>

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,439
<i>and the Presidential Adviser
on Culture, Mr. Kosovac.</i>

8
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,711
<i>I haven 't seen the exhibition,
but I see that the media</i>

9
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,356
<i>cover this event
rather vulgarly.</i>

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,071
<i>This is not art.
This is political pamphletism.</i>

11
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:47,459
<i>I  don 't understand...</i>

12
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:53,031
<i>You see, everyone rushes to defend
his freedom of speech.</i>

13
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:56,511
<i>And I don't dispute that, but...</i>

14
00:00:56,711 --> 00:01:00,471
<i>What about defending
religious freedoms?</i>

15
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,831
<i>Yes, but...</i>

16
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:05,627
<i>No one defends the religious feelings
of the great majority of Serbs</i>

17
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:10,064
<i>who feel offended by the blasphemous
works of this so-called artist.</i>

18
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:15,461
<i>The people simply do not want
this exhibition in their city.</i>

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
Hey, lovebirds.

20
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:37,334
-Good morning, teacher.
-Hello.

21
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:48,906
Excuse me, teacher!

22
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:50,523
Teacher?
Can you please tell me,

23
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:53,130
will you be asking questions
about the WWII today?

24
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:57,418
-Because others said...
-Didn't you get an 'A' last week, Dobrica?

25
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:00,483
Hello.

26
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:01,971
-Hi.
-Hi.

27
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:40,514
Where is Srba?

28
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:42,914
Dinkic, Tadija?

29
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:51,032
Teacher, Tadija said he'd be late.
They'll come.

30
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:55,083
OK. I'll wait 'till
the end of the lesson.

31
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,558
Who will take an oral exam?

32
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:03,276
Sofija, you can answer
when I finish the lecture.

33
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:06,034
My favorite question:

34
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:10,037
What was 27th of March St.
named after?

35
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:14,496
You mean, The International Crisis,
Battle for the Yugoslav Region,

36
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:18,664
and the culmination of the crisis
in the events of 25th and 2 7th of March?

37
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:21,365
Title of the lecture.
In exact words!

38
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:23,588
Shoot.

39
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,274
-Please, start.
-From where?

40
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,260
-From the beginning.
-Which chapter?

41
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,708
Sofija, you don't divide
history into chapters.

42
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:37,556
We strive to understand the causes
of an event in order to...

43
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,767
-Sorry we are late.
-Just sit down.

44
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,529
You won't admit it?

45
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:50,206
So, what happened on March 27, 1941?

46
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,249
Coup d'etat by a group of
Yugoslav Army officers.

47
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,609
-Yes. What was the cause?
-The British propaganda.

48
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,641
The British felt that the Serbs

49
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:03,089
can forgive their rulers
everything, except treason.

50
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,527
-Same as today!
-So, the MI6

51
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:09,615
plotted to declare
Prince Paul a traitor.

52
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,809
Because they saw that he
was useless to them.

53
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,529
Wait, where did you get that?
Quiet, please!

54
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,129
-A read Harold Temperley's...
-Let's take it easy now.

55
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,569
Do you think that
Prince Paul was a patriot?

56
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:30,689
He was a member of the
Karadjordjevic dynasty.

57
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,849
He was the Regent...

58
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,209
I can see that you've studied,

59
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,169
But I'm interested in your opinion:

60
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:41,329
Was his pact with the Nazis
an act of patriotism?

61
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,689
Of course! To protect the people
from German invasion.

62
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,809
Matija, I'm not asking you,
I'm asking Sofija. Quiet, please!

63
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,449
Teacher, I don't understand
what do you want from me?

64
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:56,497
Prince Paul was rehabilitated.

65
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,809
Guys! Wait a minute.

66
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,969
Don't forget about the school trip
tomorrow! After the classes.

67
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:09,809
-What grade did I get?
-A strong 'B'.

68
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,249
Communist bitch.

69
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,529
Of course he's lying!

70
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,209
-What?
-So, you're lying, eh?

71
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,369
-Don't be such a cunt!
-C'mon, say it!

72
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,876
What's going on here?

73
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:37,529
-He's a pathological lair, they all are.
-Shut up, Matija!

74
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,729
Is it true?

75
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,569
What the fuck, man?

76
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,366
-Did you hear what I asked?
-What's wrong with you?

77
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,689
This is where they'd sleep.

78
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,929
Downstairs is the workshop,

79
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:53,849
with a small stage.

80
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,409
It looks great, right?

81
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,889
It would mean a world to them.

82
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,529
Svetlana, you don't get
to see them in class.

83
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,449
Apathetic, distant...
We have to fight for them.

84
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,969
Ms Olivera, I...

85
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,329
I really don't know
what do you want from me?

86
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,689
They've already been
on a school excursion.

87
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,889
Szentendre, Budapest and Prague.

88
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,649
And who would pay for it?
Their parents?

89
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,569
The owner is a friend of my husband.

90
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,729
It's an art colony.

91
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,689
I arranged free transportation.

92
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,409
The parents agreed, it's a Saturday,
I don't see the problem?

93
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:42,049
It's not a Saturday.

94
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:46,809
It's a working Saturday.

95
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,849
Surprised you forgot.

96
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,470
And, besides...

97
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:57,129
I cannot... the school
cannot approve.

98
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,728
Why not?

99
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,049
I know it's a working Saturday.
We'd go after the classes.

100
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,809
May I ask you a favor?

101
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,729
Can you show me...

102
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:23,009
How do you switch off
the ringing on this phone?

103
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,369
I want it to be on,
but I don't want to hear it ring.

104
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,289
Just press and hold this button.

105
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,929
Oh, I see...

106
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,609
-How do I turn it back on?
-The same way.

107
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:40,529
Svetlana, we're losing them.

108
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,409
Soon, we won't even speak
the same language.

109
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:47,961
High school kids utilize
less than 800 words...

110
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,249
And that's from a Canadian study!
We can't even compare...

111
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,289
Ms Olja, this is not a kindergarten.

112
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,609
You are not their nanny.

113
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:03,009
This is a high school.

114
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,289
And what you said about them,

115
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,132
well, that's the parents' fault.

116
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,089
They've reached the age when
nothing more can be done.

117
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,649
-Did you hear this hippie crap?
-Yes.

118
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,929
Insisting on
a first-name basis with me!

119
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:28,209
Her kind wanted to see the end
of us when Milosevic fell.

120
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,969
-You know that Ivana got fired?
-Really?

121
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,089
They are moving the marketing
department to Slovenia.

122
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,449
-She'll get a severance pay.
-Well, better than nothing.

123
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,889
No way! I haven't been there
since high school.

124
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:48,529
Good night, teacher.

125
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,289
...heard about that exhibition?

126
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,193
Horrible.

127
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,201
I've just heard, this morning.

128
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:00,609
And nobody's doing anything about it!

129
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:04,089
-What the fuck? Again?
-Third child.

130
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,129
Where do they get the money?

131
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,529
No money.
She's always on maternity leave.

132
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,689
And he's, like, working.
Part time.

133
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,329
They say the first kid costs a fortune,
the others just inherit stuff.

134
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,449
-Yeah, right.
-What?

135
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,769
What about you?
You're married, after all.

136
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:21,929
Please. Imagine me as a mom?

137
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,249
Imagine Ugljesa as a dad?

138
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:30,249
Someone's going to kill Ugljesa
because of this exhibition.

139
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:32,289
-Aren't you scared?
-Why?

140
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,769
Why would anyone kill him?

141
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:37,049
Nationalists are going crazy.

142
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:40,284
-You've seen the tweets?
-Actually, the Twitter's fine,

143
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:43,169
compared to the forums!
They're hammering him.

144
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:46,369
But they never go to exhibitions.
I mean, who does?

145
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,969
Same 200 people as always,
that's it.

146
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,729
But, still...

147
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:55,728
His painting called ''Love''...
The Patriarch? Really?

148
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,009
That's a bit too much. Even for me.

149
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,249
Come on, let's go!

150
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,409
No way I'm going inside,
it's full of children.

151
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:09,289
-That's what I'm telling you!
-No way.

152
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,684
Three shots of Jaegermeister.

153
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,569
-Isidora?!
-Good evening, teacher.

154
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,929
-You work here?
-Yes.

155
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,489
You said,
three shots of Jaegermeister?

156
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,409
Two.

157
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,769
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.

158
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:09,929
-I look forward to the field trip!
-Me, too.

159
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,508
Who's there?

160
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:12,729
Come on!

161
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,059
It's not blood. It's paint.

162
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,849
What happened?

163
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,689
-Olja!
-What?

164
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:44,049
-Tell me what happened!
-I'm alright!

165
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,649
And we could've been in New York...

166
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,334
Never again going through
shit like this.

167
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:50,169
What would I do in New York?

168
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,129
What would you do?
I dunno.

169
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:01,209
You could Rollerblade
in Central Park.

170
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,489
Or go shopping.

171
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:12,969
Hang on Left-wing blogs and troll
the nationalist forums, more likely.

172
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:23,529
Beats getting soaked with paint
by a bunch of morons.

173
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:30,129
Maybe.

174
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,249
Fuck.

175
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,969
I have to take the kids
to Tesa's place tonight.

176
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,690
I have to organize the transport,
to send an invoice...

177
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,729
Are you out of your mind?

178
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,409
I don't know anymore, really.

179
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:03,969
Half of all Serbian Jews were killed
at Sajmiste concentration camp.

180
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,321
But, also, thousands
of Roma people, communists...

181
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:10,209
The communists don't count!
They were traitors!

182
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,609
Matija...

183
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:18,929
Of 200.000 people that were killed
during the WWII in Serbia,

184
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:20,929
67.000 were Partisans.

185
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,089
FC 'Partisan'!

186
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:27,969
I'm talking about death camps
and you find that funny?!

187
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,409
No, you're imposing
your ideology in the classroom.

188
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:35,761
Couldn't you talk about something more
cheerful on the field trip day?

189
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,889
Really!

190
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,449
She is trying to do her job.

191
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,849
Okay, seniors.

192
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,929
What would you like to talk about?

193
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,089
About the Champions League!

194
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,369
About love!

195
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:56,009
-No way!
-That's great!

196
00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:01,409
By the end of the school day, I want
you to write an essay about love.

197
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,369
We want the death camps back!

198
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:08,289
-Really.
-No, no. This is great.

199
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:11,729
-What does love mean to you?
-Nothing.

200
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,169
Whom do you love?
Who loves you?

201
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:19,569
And, we are gonna talk about your
essays during the trip.

202
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,089
People!

203
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,809
Do you realize that
most of the other teachers

204
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:30,457
say that you're the worst
generation ever?

205
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,049
Yeah, great!

206
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:37,929
They say that you have no empathy.
That you're cold, alienated...

207
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:41,009
-Thank you.
-Well, I don't share their opinion.

208
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,329
Maybe it's because
I'm stupid or naive,

209
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,769
or maybe it's because I've been
your age, not so long ago.

210
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,929
And it's great that
you mentioned love.

211
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,249
I'd really like to hear
your opinions about it.

212
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,713
Excuse me,
what's that got to do with history?

213
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:58,921
Everything.

214
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:02,649
-I won't take part in this.
-Me neither.

215
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,809
Radovan! Really!

216
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:10,929
Give me that cell phone.
Right now.

217
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,409
<i>Who's there?</i>

218
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,195
Who did this?

219
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,529
What?

220
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,489
One of you did this.

221
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,066
-Who?
-What?

222
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,721
Since you refuse to tell me
who did this,

223
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,489
I’ll assume that all of you
are responsible.

224
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:20,169
I'm taking this cell phone
straight to the police.

225
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:22,209
Who did what?

226
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:24,809
-You don't know, do you?!
-No, I don't.

227
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:27,129
-So, it wasn't you, then?
-No.

228
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:30,889
You neither, right?
Now listen carefully!

229
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:37,169
I'll give you a chance to tell
me who did this.

230
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,089
The one who did it
will face the consequences.

231
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,729
But if that person
hasn't got the guts to admit it,

232
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,329
I will hold all of you responsible!

233
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:50,449
In that case

234
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:55,129
I will no longer be
your teacher.

235
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:58,609
Because,

236
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,315
this...

237
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:04,249
There is a name for this in the aw.

238
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,849
And there is a street name for it, too.

239
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,289
And in both cases,
you know the procedure.

240
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,969
Was I clear?!

241
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:13,609
Yes...

242
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,409
Was I clear, Tadija?

243
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,409
Why allways me?

244
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,968
Am I clear?

245
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:24,618
Yes.

246
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:28,929
Now you'll hand over
your cell phone to me.

247
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:32,712
Here it is.

248
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:38,891
In fact, all of you will hand over
your cell phones.

249
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,249
-No, really!
-Come on!

250
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:00,449
You know that I couldn't have done it.

251
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,369
I don't care, Sandra!

252
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,529
My Mom has to call me.

253
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:08,729
You're taking away
our personal property.

254
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,289
You'll get it back once we discover
who attacked me,

255
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:16,049
who filmed it,
and who uploaded it.

256
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:33,089
Theese will remain locked in the
school vault until I get the answers.

257
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,849
-Man...
-She'll be back in a minute.

258
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,689
Poor teacher.

259
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,929
-She's really lost it.
-Right.

260
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:50,249
-What a retard.
-I've never seen her like this.

261
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,209
For real?

262
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:56,449
Why the fuck did you have to watch
the video in the first place?

263
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,609
Wait, are you fucking serious?

264
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,929
-Why?
-I'm not the one who uploaded it.

265
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:04,409
-She gonna give them back?
-What else?

266
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,977
-I need a cigarette.
-Me too.

267
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,809
Of all the things,
she had to take away the phones.

268
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,329
-Wow, it's the end of the world!
-Well, I'm not happy about it.

269
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,329
Punishing the whole class because
couple of retards...

270
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:19,849
She had no right!

271
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:21,449
Shut up!

272
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,329
You watched it too, didn't you?

273
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:25,609
You could've just gone back
to your place!

274
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,209
Don't blame it on me.

275
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:31,089
You have morons like that everywhere.

276
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:34,249
I'll kill myself if we end up
not going to the school trip.

277
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:35,889
After this? No way.

278
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,649
Hey!!

279
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:40,769
Fallout Girl is taking control.

280
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,961
Take care of wour personal hygiene first!

281
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,689
Let's speak one at a time, OK?

282
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:49,569
I got the video from
something-whore@yahoo.com

283
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:51,489
I didn't open it.
You?

284
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,969
-I got it from the same address.
-Just like all of us.

285
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,689
-I didn't get it!
-So, the address is the same.

286
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:01,529
This means that we can
easily find out...

287
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:04,489
What? She wants to figure out
who uploaded it?

288
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:07,449
No, she wants to know
who filmed it.

289
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,609
-Why would any of us do it?
-Right, she's got no proof.

290
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,169
She can't prove a thing,
the bitch is tripping.

291
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,489
How can she know it was one of us?

292
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:17,649
Dude... dude!

293
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,569
The video was viewed just 9 times,
and it already reached us.

294
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:24,009
So, it must've been uploaded
by someone here.

295
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,929
-Maybe it was you?
-Maybe it was Dobrica.

296
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,289
-I didn't!
-That's not the problem.

297
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:35,129
It will take a minute for the cops
to trace the IP address.

298
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,409
I could do that,
I just need a computer.

299
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,169
You could do it my ass!
Face the blackboard!

300
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:43,889
Keep quiet, they'll kill us...

301
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:51,065
Morons... I just can't stand
stupid people...

302
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:53,913
Yo, nerd!
Who's a moron?

303
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:58,129
I'm telling you, the cops can trace
the IP address...

304
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:01,849
Again with the cops?
Keep facing the blackboard!

305
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,769
You're pathetic!

306
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:07,489
Olja won't call the cops
if we tell her who did it.

307
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:08,969
Why wouldn't she?

308
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:12,849
See you after school, pretty boy.

309
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:17,409
-Olja is a commie.
-Fuck you.

310
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:20,129
Stutter-mouth, you're loud.
Maybe you're the one?

311
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:22,889
-I'm not.
-''I'm not''.

312
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,049
Stuttering retard.

313
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:31,129
Just like you don't go around telling
people I'm a fag, right?

314
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:33,329
I was just stating facts.

315
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:37,515
So you told them to
kick my ass?

316
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:42,009
They're unbelievable! She busted
her ass for us...

317
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,235
Why?

318
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,209
Because I don't believe you.

319
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:53,409
Because I'm not daft.

320
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,769
Chill out, jock.

321
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,929
Wait.
Let me handle this.

322
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,849
Not daft, eh?

323
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:05,569
He can go on for hours, like...

324
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:10,449
Then don't assume anything
about me, bro. Get it?

325
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,969
Is that it?

326
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,929
That's it.

327
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:15,769
Okay.

328
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,609
...they have no fucking idea what she
went through to...

329
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:32,554
He thinks he's a stud
if he fucked that whore.

330
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:41,049
Fucking jocks.

331
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:43,209
What's your problem?

332
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:47,169
-Just shut up for a while!
-Fuck you!

333
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:52,604
..and nobody gives a shit
about how she felt...

334
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:58,649
People, one at a time!

335
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:03,769
-Let's speak one at a time.
-That's what I said three minutes ago.

336
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,009
So, nobody will admit?

337
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:07,329
Isn't it obvious?

338
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:10,304
Then, let's tell that to Olja.

339
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,681
If none of us did it,

340
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:14,289
why would we be afraid of cops?

341
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:17,889
OK, why not. Strahinja,
what's your problem?

342
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:22,369
Maybe we could write
those essays, after all.

343
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:25,089
After that, we could all
take responsibility...

344
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:28,849
I don't want to take responsibility!
I don't give a fuck!

345
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,209
-Sit down!
-I haven't done a thing!

346
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:33,289
It runs in the family.

347
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:36,169
I didn't either,
but I feel ashamed!

348
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,009
She broke her balls to find
the money for the trip,

349
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,049
the school didn't give her a cent!

350
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,849
Are we going to that trip at all?

351
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:48,609
Can't you see that we're going
to be questioned by the police?

352
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,729
I don't give a fuck!

353
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,369
I'm not gonna let some moron
stop me from going...

354
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:56,529
Please, just go and write
that fashion blog of yours.

355
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:59,649
You could read it sometimes!

356
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,969
Junkie skank! Just look at you.
Don't talk back!

357
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:05,689
Fuck off!

358
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:10,049
You're really hot in these
pants, sweetheart!

359
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,409
This one is off to confess,
right?

360
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:15,449
Yeah, right, he'll confess
everything.

361
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,729
-Chill out, Jelena!
-She started it!

362
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:20,249
-She provoked me!
-Just behave!

363
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:23,489
-Little slut.
-And mind the language!

364
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:25,849
Will you stop arguing!?

365
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:29,489
Just write the stupid essays!
I'll go crazy!

366
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:34,809
Okay. Just take it easy.

367
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,369
I freaked out. So what?

368
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:45,049
Love. Amore...

369
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:49,129
Love is when stupid jocks
fuck the hot cheerleaders.

370
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:52,009
Who gives a fuck
about the rest of us.

371
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:57,769
Love is the meaning of life, Miksa!
You know that, right?

372
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:35,669
Are we really going
to write this shit?

373
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:37,729
Write it down.

374
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:40,009
-I don't know what.
-Cut the crap.

375
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:42,449
-Just scribble anything.
-What?

376
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:46,409
-Hey...
-Give me the pen, please.

377
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,249
I'm sorry for being
such a bitch.

378
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:53,769
Dawson's Creek, dude?

379
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,861
Never heard of it.

380
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,449
You haven't written a word.

381
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,209
...it ran for some 10.000 seasons.

382
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:05,889
The guy who made Dawson's Creek
made The Vampire Diaries.

383
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,289
Dawson goes through changes.

384
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:11,769
In the final season,
he looks like our Dobrica.

385
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,369
-Please, write something for me.
-You two are morons.

386
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,329
Nina...

387
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,569
Nina... Nina...

388
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:42,889
Please, ask her to write just
two lines for us, nothing more.

389
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,009
-Okay?
-Yeah. Please, write something.

390
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:48,489
-She retarded?
-Just do it.

391
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:55,449
Look at them,
they are really into it.

392
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:57,609
<i>''My dear classmates''...</i>

393
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:26,929
You dated Dinkic, you know them.
Really think they could've...

394
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:29,969
-Absolutely.
-But, still, something like this?

395
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,249
Well, it wasn't my Granny...

396
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:34,249
I guess not.

397
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:37,489
Shut up, you two!

398
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:42,409
-What's wrong with her?
-I don't know.

399
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,409
Gross.

400
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:46,969
Just ignore them.
Crazy biatchez.

401
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,289
-I can see that.
-What did you write about?

402
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:52,889
I drew myself at the stadium,
that's true love.

403
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:55,369
Yes, but for the wrong club.

404
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:58,289
Why don't you write
something about Lazar?

405
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,129
-I know you find him cute.
-Just leave it, will you?

406
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,407
Strale!

407
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:06,729
Strahinja...

408
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:08,889
Hey, this is me,
sitting next to you.

409
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,441
I see.

410
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:16,249
You saw that message
on Facebook, too!

411
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:20,009
-''Seen at 21 :05''.
-So?

412
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,529
So, you could write something back.

413
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:24,369
It pisses me off.

414
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:28,769
You're liking all those stupid
basketball jocks on Facebook all day,

415
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:31,929
but when I ask you a serious question,
you never answer.

416
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,329
So what?
Being bitchy again?

417
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,249
No, sweetie. Really.

418
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,809
Forget it.

419
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,969
But, I had to choose myself.

420
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:46,169
What's wrong with you?

421
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:49,729
-What?
-What?

422
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:54,049
Did you see that?
What a slut!

423
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:56,969
Look at this.

424
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,569
I don't like it.

425
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:07,089
Just look at him.

426
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:09,249
-Who wrote this?
-The Midget.

427
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,529
Really?
Nice handwriting.

428
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,049
Yeah, like a little girl.

429
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:22,480
Wait...

430
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:25,372
You’ll soon turn 18,
you know?

431
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:28,188
-Who do you play against?
-''Rad'', their field.

432
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:32,588
Retards are still waiting
for the school trip. Nice.

433
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:37,425
If my Lilith is in Capricorn,
and his in Scorpio...

434
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:42,194
Then the two of you
are sex maniacs!

435
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,864
We're locked in the school.

436
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,943
-What do you mean?
-alll the doors are locked.

437
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:58,914
-Really?
-For real?

438
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:02,893
-She's full of shit.
-Maybe the door just got stuck?

439
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:06,354
Olivera locked us!
She completely lost it.

440
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:09,074
-Like, really-really?
-I swear.

441
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:11,471
Where is Mile the janitor?

442
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:12,905
His room is empty.

443
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,200
What about the teacher's room?

444
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:18,554
-Icy, seriously?
-Yup.

445
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:20,834
Now what?

446
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:22,954
Locked us in to call the cops?

447
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:25,274
No way, man.

448
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:27,874
Why would she do that?

449
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,034
Maybe because they fucked up?

450
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:32,194
Let's see what's going on.

451
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:36,594
Where are they going?

452
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:40,494
The Baboons are off to save us.

453
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,314
Final Destination 3.

454
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,034
-Did you try the back door?
-Yes.

455
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:53,474
What if she really...?

456
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:56,234
The phones.

457
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,642
She took our phones!!

458
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:04,641
Right, you're the smart
one. Go ahead, open it.

459
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,114
Fucktard!

460
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:17,634
-Won't budge!
-Because you're a moron.

461
00:34:17,834 --> 00:34:20,274
She really locked us in.
Now what?

462
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:23,154
What do you mean, take it easy?

463
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:27,634
I never turn off my phone!
If Granny calls, she'll freak out!

464
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:31,434
-She'll think something happened...
-Granny will die.

465
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,394
-Do they know about the school trip?
-Yes.

466
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:37,914
They'll think you're out of town,
no signal, and that's it.

467
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:40,162
Someone will contact her.

468
00:34:40,554 --> 00:34:44,714
How will they contact her?
By smoke signals?

469
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:47,242
Does anyone have a second phone?

470
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,034
I've got three in my bag.

471
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:51,274
She'd die without a witty remark.

472
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:54,642
-Got something on you?
-Just one shitty XTC.

473
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:57,354
Hey, there's a landline
in the school, too!

474
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:00,554
-Wow, you're right!
-Smartass.

475
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:03,834
-Shit, the party's over now!
-We'll use the landlline.

476
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:05,376
What?

477
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:08,354
The landlline phone is dead.

478
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:09,794
No shit!

479
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:13,514
No internet, either.
The router's dead.

480
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:17,234
-What's dead?
-The router.

481
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:20,034
He doesn't know what a router is.
Unbelievable.

482
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:23,306
There has to be a phone
in the Principal's office.

483
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:25,434
-Let's go there.
-It's locked.

484
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:29,514
We'll break the door. Easier
than the front one.

485
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:33,514
Tadija, take it easy,
we’ll end up in jail.

486
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:36,067
Who'll send us to jail?

487
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:40,188
Olja, who else? She locked
us in, she took our phones.

488
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:43,514
She killed the... router.

489
00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:45,514
She's coming back with the cops.

490
00:35:45,714 --> 00:35:50,874
We'll just say that we're locked
inside without fucking phones!

491
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:53,674
-It's not that.
-What, then?

492
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:56,314
You're talking about
your dealing drugs?

493
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,642
-Olja doesn't know about that.
-What a retard.

494
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,584
Hey, you've got that other phone.

495
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:02,634
-I don't.
-The ''business'' one.

496
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:04,242
-I threw it away.
-What?

497
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,394
I threw the sim card. Drop it.

498
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:07,834
Can't we find it?

499
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:10,562
Hey, dude... if anyone's got...

500
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,316
another sim card... here it is.

501
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:18,554
-No way you threw the card.
-No, I'll use it to call the cops.

502
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:20,714
-Dude, I don't believe...
-What?!

503
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:24,394
-We could've called someone.
-Who?

504
00:36:24,594 --> 00:36:26,554
Your old man, maybe?

505
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:28,234
What's he gotta do with this?

506
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:31,642
He probably knows the Chief of Police.
They are in the same Party.

507
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:34,394
First of all, my Dad is not
in that Party anymore.

508
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,282
You know, the old boy's club.

509
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,490
Can he say that we
didn't upload the video?

510
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:41,074
But we didn't.

511
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:43,034
-Shut your mouth.
-Shut up!

512
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,194
So it was us, after all?

513
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:47,994
Ask the cameraman.

514
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:49,834
Hey, dude!

515
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:52,362
I was behind the lens,
you can't see me on the video.

516
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,434
That because you're a cunt.

517
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:57,714
That's what you get
when you want to play the lead.

518
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:05,394
Now, what?

519
00:37:05,594 --> 00:37:07,554
-Shut your mouth.
-Shut up!

520
00:37:08,074 --> 00:37:09,834
I told you so.

521
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:11,994
Didn't I?

522
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:14,074
It's official:
we're in deep shit.

523
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,274
-Really? I don't see no shit.
-What happened?

524
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:21,194
We can't use the landlline!

525
00:37:21,394 --> 00:37:23,354
-She pulled out the cable!
-No joke.

526
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:28,034
That psycho pulled out the cable
and took it away.

527
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:29,354
Way to go!

528
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,774
-She pulled out what?
-Sit down, please.

529
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:34,914
And I said she's a psycho!

530
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:38,722
Dude, thanks for sticking your neck
out for me yesterday.

531
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,994
-No problem. What?
-Seriously?

532
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,514
Yeah, she pulled it out.

533
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:46,222
What a moron!

534
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:48,674
What kind of a person
could do that?

535
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,333
What kind of a person
could think of that?

536
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:53,194
Breakfast Club. The movie.

537
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,794
Kids get locked in school?

538
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:58,154
-What are we gonna do?
-Nothing.

539
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:00,874
You don't believe all of this
happened by accident?

540
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:03,394
Anything can happen
when the shit hits the fan.

541
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:05,714
What did they expect?

542
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:07,794
-Don't panic now.
-''Love is hard''...

543
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,154
And when should I panic?
When we get slaughtered?

544
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:12,794
Cool down!

545
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:15,834
We can shout through the window!

546
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:20,954
Or, you can jump? But, all of
the first floor windows have bars.

547
00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:23,314
-Hey, Matija can jump!

548
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:27,394
C'mon, take a jump for
the holy Serbian land!

549
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,474
What's the point of all this?

550
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:34,834
Shit, no Wi-Fi, no Facebook.
How can you defend Kosovo now?

551
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:38,554
-Can we really shout from the window?
-Who would hear us?

552
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:41,194
You'd have to shout over
the hamburger takeaway.

553
00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:43,314
Wait, maybe Aunt Ruza is still there.

554
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:45,754
Aunt Ruza!

555
00:38:45,954 --> 00:38:48,514
The hamburger takeout
is closed on Saturdays.

556
00:38:48,714 --> 00:38:51,474
Can you please stop doing that!

557
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:54,394
-She could send smoke signals...
-With her tits.

558
00:38:54,674 --> 00:38:57,434
-Or we could tie the curtains...
-The curtains!

559
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,754
If something happens to Granny,
I’ll sue Olja!

560
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:04,834
alll alone. Finally...

561
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:09,074
Is it really so funny that
we're locked??

562
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:13,994
Wow, we're locked in!
Let's panic!

563
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:17,114
-Alll those condoms...
-Wait, he's right...

564
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:20,114
Maybe she just went
somewhere and she'll be back.

565
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:22,722
For three hours now?

566
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:26,434
The worst thing that can happen to us
is to stay here until morning.

567
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,074
It's warm, we have food,

568
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:30,875
someone will open
the door tomorrow and that's it.

569
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,154
Way to go, Strale!

570
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:35,154
What's your problem?

571
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:38,314
I'm serious.
You're a god among retards!

572
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:40,794
You're actually making sense.

573
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:44,794
And you wonder why half of the
school wants to kill you?

574
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:47,474
Back off, man.

575
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:52,314
Jelena... Jelena!

576
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,434
There she goes.

577
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:58,594
Running after him like...

578
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:03,514
Strale... Strale!

579
00:40:04,794 --> 00:40:06,554
Strahinja, stop!

580
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:09,274
Where the fuck are you running?

581
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,641
Nowhere.

582
00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:14,274
Can I go with you?

583
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:18,142
Whatever.

584
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:33,394
When was the last time the three
of us hung out together?

585
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:36,914
I can't remember.

586
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,514
Strahinja is a cool dude.

587
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:42,954
Cool? I hope he dies from prostate
cancer... like, tomorrow.

588
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:45,114
What did they write?

589
00:40:45,314 --> 00:40:47,514
Terrible things.

590
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:50,034
-What now?
-Let's see...

591
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:52,834
We can do drugs!

592
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,520
That would be so like us.

593
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,527
Or...

594
00:40:58,554 --> 00:41:00,514
-GeForce!
-GeForce! Let's go!

595
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:02,674
-What?
-Get up!

596
00:41:11,194 --> 00:41:13,474
Take my picture.
Blow the smoke.

597
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:17,474
Hey, Sofija...
what's that you're reading?

598
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:22,394
Wow... history.
Tadija's getting an education.

599
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:33,834
Never dug that shit.

600
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,834
We just do the uppers
in my 'hood$.

601
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,354
A faggot, and a junkie.
Fantastic.

602
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:48,042
Hey! You, Nazi-boy,
did you say something?

603
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:54,274
Looking, eh...?

604
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,194
-No, thanks.
-Ever tried it?

605
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:02,194
Once, on my hometown,
but it didn't hit me.

606
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,674
No wonder. Try again.

607
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:08,388
-No, thanks.
-Look. I'm Tadija!

608
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:12,394
Wait.

609
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,754
-Got some water?
-No.

610
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,834
-What?
-Trying to get her hooked?

611
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,802
Now it's free,
later you profit.

612
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:28,913
The evil dealer... plus a Croat!

613
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:32,194
Don't just stand there!
Bite!

614
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:34,354
I wasn't talking to you.

615
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:41,754
Because I'm a faggot?

616
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:47,994
The school's big enough.

617
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:53,114
No, wait! Is it because we're faggots,
or because we're Croats?

618
00:42:57,554 --> 00:42:59,594
Wait. You look stronger to me.

619
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:02,194
What is it?
Hitting the gym?

620
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:04,794
You look taller.

621
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:07,514
You got some special workout for that?

622
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,994
Hey, bro... tell me something.

623
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:12,634
Why don't you call sometimes?

624
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:15,754
No, really, we could go
to a movie or something.

625
00:43:15,954 --> 00:43:17,554
Or a nice dinner?

626
00:43:17,754 --> 00:43:20,794
Come on, don't treat me
just like a sex object,

627
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,634
I'm a human being too, you know?

628
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,554
I don't know what you're talking
about, you sick freak.

629
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,034
''Just stating facts''.

630
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:31,394
No, you're staging an incident so you
could say that I bully you,

631
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:33,674
that's exactly why people
hate your kind.

632
00:43:33,874 --> 00:43:36,474
Instead of treating
your illness in private,

633
00:43:36,674 --> 00:43:38,674
you parade it like it's a virtue.

634
00:43:38,874 --> 00:43:40,954
And what do you parade?

635
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:43,194
Greater Serbia? Smaller dick?

636
00:43:43,394 --> 00:43:47,394
The fact that I'm a Serbian patriot
and an Orthodox Christian...

637
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:49,714
Okay, forget it.
You know what I think?

638
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:50,994
I don't want to know.

639
00:43:51,194 --> 00:43:55,034
I think that those ultra-nationalist
so-called patriot opinions,

640
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:58,954
are just one big sexual
frustration, you know?

641
00:43:59,154 --> 00:44:02,754
-Come on!
-I'm talking to my bro here.

642
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:08,914
-By the way, do you get laid at all?
-Get your filthy hands off me.

643
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:11,074
Sex is not filthy, man.

644
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:15,114
Just get yourself a nice girl,
a real Serbian...

645
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:17,274
Leave me alone.

646
00:44:19,274 --> 00:44:21,714
And how can I do that?

647
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:23,634
How?

648
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:28,074
The minute I do it, you start
telling everybody that I'm gay.

649
00:44:31,714 --> 00:44:34,234
Wanna know when will
I leave you alone?

650
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:38,354
When I find a really sweet
girl for you to fuck.

651
00:44:43,354 --> 00:44:47,594
You can't wank off to holy relics
for the rest of your life!

652
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:50,914
Believe me... once
you fuck a living being,

653
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:54,194
you'll wanna vote for Obama
in the elections!

654
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,594
Hey, biathcez, wait for me!

655
00:45:19,074 --> 00:45:20,794
Any luck?

656
00:45:23,194 --> 00:45:25,234
-Just 5 more cm.
-Size of your package!

657
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:31,314
Can you please explain
what are you trying to do?

658
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,474
I just want to see if it works.

659
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:38,394
Okay. Do that.

660
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:42,994
That ugly bitch Isidora is right,
we'd better stay here.

661
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:45,314
Better for you, maybe.

662
00:45:45,514 --> 00:45:48,794
If we split, that will
make us prime suspects.

663
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:53,954
What the fuck is this?!

664
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:58,074
It must be those nerds!

665
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:02,434
How do you turn this off?

666
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,674
<i>This is a magical night.</i>

667
00:46:08,074 --> 00:46:11,714
<i>Strange creatures are leaving
their crypts</i>

668
00:46:11,914 --> 00:46:14,194
<i>...and caves.
And anything is possible.</i>

669
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:17,354
-This is your goth bitch.
-Fuck you.

670
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:20,514
-Turn the freak off!
-Turn her off!

671
00:46:23,354 --> 00:46:26,394
<i>Tonight, just for you,</i>

672
00:46:26,594 --> 00:46:29,474
<i>DJ Mary Shelley.</i>

673
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:35,234
I still don't get it.

674
00:46:35,434 --> 00:46:37,154
That's because you're slow!

675
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:46,474
Let's connect these and play.

676
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:49,754
You can't even pay Prince of Persia 1
on that piece of shit.

677
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:52,354
This is junk, man!
286 processor...

678
00:47:01,994 --> 00:47:03,514
Why did you do that?

679
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,714
You didn't mind the music
last Thursday!

680
00:47:08,674 --> 00:47:11,674
Remember last Thursday?

681
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,034
Not really.

682
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:15,234
This is Prof. Greaseball's sweater.

683
00:47:15,434 --> 00:47:17,274
We started going out?

684
00:47:17,474 --> 00:47:18,594
We wanna be cool?

685
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,754
-Tell Kosta what happened.
-What?

686
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:22,714
You know what.
Embarrassed?

687
00:47:22,914 --> 00:47:24,874
-No.
-Then tell him.

688
00:47:25,674 --> 00:47:28,074
-With whom?
-With what.

689
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:30,754
-With a girl.
-Don't get carried away.

690
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:32,194
Well, if it was a girl...

691
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,154
She blew you off!

692
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:37,034
That's not the point.
Kosta, you can't imagine...

693
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:39,754
I got laid, and you didn't.
End of story.

694
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:43,954
More like Ursula from The Little
Mermaid gave you a BJ in the toilet.

695
00:47:44,154 --> 00:47:46,554
Gross... Look at this.

696
00:47:47,874 --> 00:47:49,074
Just watch.

697
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,634
I draw a line here...

698
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:54,794
And an 'F' turns into an 'A'.

699
00:47:55,074 --> 00:47:58,714
And GeForce gets bought by parents!
That's what I call art.

700
00:48:00,034 --> 00:48:02,354
You could've just erase that 'F'.

701
00:48:02,554 --> 00:48:04,674
How? Scratch it away?

702
00:48:04,874 --> 00:48:06,074
Acetonitrile.

703
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,794
Where do I get acetonitrile,
you troglodyte?

704
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:12,074
-Chemistry cabinet.
-What are you doing?!

705
00:48:12,274 --> 00:48:17,674
Well... we are redefining the results
of science research.

706
00:48:17,874 --> 00:48:20,394
We thought you were
tweaking the grades.

707
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:29,194
-Is this the Principal’s office?
-No, her assistant’s.

708
00:48:29,394 --> 00:48:32,114
I remember when I was here
with my parents...

709
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:33,634
Because of that clip?

710
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:37,674
''Pierced chick sucks it all
the way''? A masterpiece.

711
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:41,594
-You're pathetic.
-I'm her true fan!

712
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:54,834
Hey, dude.

713
00:49:13,634 --> 00:49:14,754
Awesome, man!

714
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:23,954
Am I bothering you?

715
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:26,114
No, no. Come in.

716
00:49:27,754 --> 00:49:29,154
I can't find a place to study.

717
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:31,954
This dreadful music roars
all over the school.

718
00:49:32,874 --> 00:49:35,474
We can turn it down.
There's a switch.

719
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:42,834
Thank you.

720
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:52,114
Unfortunately, I cannot mute the lost
Serbian kids raised by turbo-folk.

721
00:49:52,794 --> 00:49:56,554
I could literally feel this song
chewing my brain.

722
00:49:56,754 --> 00:49:58,114
Idiots.

723
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:10,716
I didn't get stoned like this
since grade school.

724
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:33,874
-Hey, stop smoking, will you?
-Why?

725
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:37,634
We left the classroom because
you turned it into a gas chamber.

726
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,994
Then you came here.
Can't you be somewhere else?

727
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:15,234
Way to go.

728
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,434
You're great.

729
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:29,034
Strale...

730
00:52:29,234 --> 00:52:31,194
Come on.

731
00:52:32,474 --> 00:52:33,594
Strahinja!

732
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:40,074
-Strahinja...
-What?

733
00:52:54,154 --> 00:52:55,314
That's it.

734
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:58,354
-It's over.
-Really?

735
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:00,634
You're done playing.

736
00:53:18,514 --> 00:53:19,914
Strahinja...

737
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:23,594
-I'll be going now.
-See you.

738
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:49,034
Could you keep
the noise down?

739
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:50,522
What's the problem now?

740
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:54,354
All I asked was if you could
be a little quieter.

741
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:57,234
This is a library, there is a sign
in Serbian alphabet,

742
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,154
you should know how to read it,
since you live in Serbia.

743
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:05,034
A library. Not an opium den.
Or the office of the Liberal Party.

744
00:54:05,634 --> 00:54:07,554
You could at least open the window.

745
00:54:07,754 --> 00:54:10,194
No, it's cold.
Let them go somewhere else.

746
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:11,794
Why don't you go?

747
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:13,194
Really?!

748
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:16,634
Just as we Serbs left Croatia
after Operation Storm?

749
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:20,274
Just as I left the classroom?

750
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:22,474
No! This is where I draw the line.

751
00:54:23,154 --> 00:54:25,234
Don't be such a primitive, Matija.

752
00:54:25,434 --> 00:54:28,594
What does getting high
has to do with Operation Storm?

753
00:54:28,794 --> 00:54:31,594
So, let them play Croat
nationalist songs here?

754
00:54:31,794 --> 00:54:33,754
This was not a nationalist song.

755
00:54:33,762 --> 00:54:35,002
Cut the crap, Matija?

756
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:37,034
I'm just stating facts.

757
00:54:38,514 --> 00:54:42,514
In 1941, they slaughtered
my grandfather.

758
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:46,033
In 1995, they killed my uncle while
we fled from the Croat offensive.

759
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:48,361
I won't stand this shit anymore!

760
00:54:50,034 --> 00:54:51,874
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

761
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:53,714
Hey, man.

762
00:54:53,914 --> 00:54:55,834
You missed the target here.

763
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:59,834
The Croat nationalists killed
3 members of my family in WWII.

764
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:03,274
Don't explain yourself to him,
he's obviously insane.

765
00:55:03,282 --> 00:55:06,242
Right. Whenever you lack arguments,
I'm ''insane''.

766
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:07,693
Let's go, Ana.

767
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:19,034
Hey, Matija...
can I see your ID?

768
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,194
-Why?
-I want to see something.

769
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:25,434
-Why do you want my ID?
-Just to check something.

770
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:26,994
No way.

771
00:55:30,354 --> 00:55:33,874
Operation Storm, Croat nationalists...
he's full of bullshit!

772
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:37,154
He's a Scorpio, meaning
he was born in November,

773
00:55:37,354 --> 00:55:39,354
after the Croat offensive.

774
00:55:39,554 --> 00:55:42,034
That's why he didn't want me
to see his ID.

775
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:41,954
Hoes! You're shitface drunk!

776
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:49,834
-What's this?
-Dinkic's passing grade in Latin.

777
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:56,314
How could've anyone listened
to the music coming from this?

778
00:57:57,194 --> 00:57:59,274
I'd make a sweater from this tape!

779
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:01,434
Imagine a sweater?

780
00:58:01,634 --> 00:58:02,754
Or leggings.

781
00:58:02,954 --> 00:58:05,714
Yeah right.
Leggings and a crop top.

782
00:58:05,914 --> 00:58:09,234
Like you'd actually prefer this
to an mp3 payer? Boring.

783
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:13,322
Right. Everything's boring now.

784
00:58:13,714 --> 00:58:16,994
You used to wait all day
to buy one Iron Maiden album,

785
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:20,474
and now you download their compete
works in a few seconds,

786
00:58:20,674 --> 00:58:22,634
and when they ask you
about the Maidens,

787
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:26,154
you're, like,
''Yeah, the Maidens are okay''.

788
00:58:29,234 --> 00:58:30,754
What's a ''Maiden''?

789
00:58:30,762 --> 00:58:33,002
That bar uptown, don't be basic.

790
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:36,290
Let's go. What are you doing
with these retards, anyway?

791
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:39,405
After we drink this.
Where have you been?

792
00:58:39,873 --> 00:58:41,553
Dude, what's this?

793
00:58:42,074 --> 00:58:43,954
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

794
00:58:43,962 --> 00:58:46,793
In the gym? You're lying!

795
00:58:48,154 --> 00:58:49,674
What?

796
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:52,594
On the wrestling mat?

797
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:54,754
I knew it!

798
00:58:56,474 --> 00:58:58,074
Three times.

799
00:58:58,674 --> 00:59:04,114
The first time it was all
gentle and cuddly and kisses...

800
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,794
-And then...
-And then?

801
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:08,954
Yes!

802
00:59:10,194 --> 00:59:12,354
He totally rocked!

803
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:14,994
-You didn't miss his balls?
-Shut up.

804
00:59:15,714 --> 00:59:17,314
I'll tell you about it later.

805
00:59:18,095 --> 00:59:20,455
No problem, just ignore us.

806
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,632
Radovan, sweetie...

807
00:59:26,114 --> 00:59:31,114
Don't you owe me some money
for this sexual education?

808
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:32,834
What do you mean?

809
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:36,474
Ever since junior year
I keep talking, and talking,

810
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,914
and still, nothing.

811
00:59:39,114 --> 00:59:41,634
You just wank off to my stories,
and I get nothing.

812
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:43,954
You really are a wacko.

813
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:47,154
Like you're normal?
You and these...

814
00:59:48,194 --> 00:59:52,474
You're listening to some music
nobody's ever heard of,

815
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:56,434
you play Counters all day long
and you never get laid. That's normal?

816
00:59:56,634 --> 01:00:00,194
-First of all, we don't pay Counters.
-Counter Strike is for the plebs.

817
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:02,314
-What do you play, then?
-Warcraft.

818
01:00:02,514 --> 01:00:06,314
Twelve passes, level 89
in Mists of Pandaria.

819
01:00:06,514 --> 01:00:09,634
Mists of Pandaria is crap,
switch to Diablo III.

820
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:13,514
See?
You guys are morons.

821
01:00:14,074 --> 01:00:16,834
And what the fuck are you?
Kim Kardashian?

822
01:00:17,874 --> 01:00:23,074
You'd still fuck me. In a reality
show, if only you could.

823
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:26,794
But I'd rather
fuck that bottle, thank you.

824
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:28,954
Jelena, chill out, really!

825
01:00:29,594 --> 01:00:32,634
-They are our friends!
-You're full of crap, Sandra.

826
01:00:32,834 --> 01:00:35,154
Everyone is your friend
when you get drunk!

827
01:00:35,354 --> 01:00:38,594
Where could you even meet geeks like
them, if it wasn't for school?

828
01:00:38,794 --> 01:00:42,114
Just look at them. Straight from
The Big Bang Theory.

829
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:46,194
We're sorry if we all can't have
a perfect boyfriend like you.

830
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:47,514
Jealous?

831
01:00:47,714 --> 01:00:51,794
-Why would I be jealous?
-I don't know.

832
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:55,874
Maybe because Strahinja
blew you off in junior year?

833
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:58,354
Who told you that?

834
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,714
Strahinja.

835
01:00:59,914 --> 01:01:01,794
What a stud.

836
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:04,274
Did he tell you that
he couldn't get it up?

837
01:01:04,474 --> 01:01:06,434
I bet he did?

838
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:09,194
His prostate, man.

839
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:58,794
Go, Strale, go!

840
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,274
Go, Strale!

841
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:08,034
Strale's the Man!

842
01:02:09,954 --> 01:02:13,514
-You got a problem?
-Dude, just do your thing.

843
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:15,562
Like I'm not here.

844
01:02:19,394 --> 01:02:22,594
Seriously, drop it, man.
I'm not in the mood.

845
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:27,074
Mood for what?
I didn't say a thing.

846
01:02:36,434 --> 01:02:37,554
That's a cool...

847
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:39,602
Coo tracksuit.
Where did you buy it?

848
01:02:41,034 --> 01:02:44,314
What's with these
fucking gay jokes?

849
01:02:44,714 --> 01:02:46,234
No joke, bro.

850
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:56,554
Let's play ball!

851
01:02:59,057 --> 01:03:01,144
I am not gonna fuck you,
I swear.

852
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,472
Hey!

853
01:03:02,782 --> 01:03:05,422
What? Wanna beat me up?

854
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:08,474
Don't go all Tadija on me,
I'm just messing with you.

855
01:03:08,674 --> 01:03:11,754
We're locked in the school.
Don't get all worked up.

856
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:14,452
I'm not worked up,
you're just pushing it.

857
01:03:18,874 --> 01:03:21,634
You're afraid I'll kill you
in one-on-one?

858
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:35,354
-Where now, dude?
-To kick your ass, dude.

859
01:03:36,474 --> 01:03:38,754
Man, we're in real shit.

860
01:03:38,954 --> 01:03:41,914
Yeah, she really lost it.

861
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,594
-What's this?
-You'll see.

862
01:03:47,794 --> 01:03:50,314
The Don's office?

863
01:03:50,514 --> 01:03:52,234
This is where the devil sleeps.

864
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:56,074
Like she'd call the cops
because of red paint?

865
01:03:59,914 --> 01:04:02,794
Let her call them!
We'll fuck them, too!

866
01:04:02,994 --> 01:04:06,834
Who are you gonna fuck, shorty?
That faggot already got your ass!

867
01:04:08,154 --> 01:04:10,434
Don't laugh, your dad will get it!

868
01:04:10,634 --> 01:04:12,834
At east he's better looking
than your mom!

869
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:17,274
Ready for some time travel?

870
01:04:28,234 --> 01:04:30,354
This is what I call a spa!

871
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:33,274
No really, Lazar kicked your ass.

872
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:37,674
He's full of those boxing tricks.

873
01:04:38,394 --> 01:04:41,234
That was a sucker punch.

874
01:04:41,434 --> 01:04:46,234
He won't get me next time,
now I know the catch!

875
01:04:46,434 --> 01:04:49,754
Maybe he's not a queer,
but he's a pussy.

876
01:04:50,034 --> 01:04:51,634
I'll get him next time.

877
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:55,882
If he was a faggot, he wouldn't
go around fighting people.

878
01:04:56,274 --> 01:04:57,554
No way, man.

879
01:04:57,754 --> 01:05:00,274
That dude showed that
he's got balls, and that's it.

880
01:05:00,474 --> 01:05:02,674
Did you expect him
to say something like,

881
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:05,383
''My hands are lethal weapons''?

882
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,434
And why wouldn't a boxer be gay?

883
01:05:13,634 --> 01:05:15,034
Gimme a break.

884
01:05:15,234 --> 01:05:17,714
You think Mike Tyson
gets it in the ass?

885
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,234
Go back to your time machine!

886
01:05:21,074 --> 01:05:23,074
But really? Know any gays?

887
01:05:23,274 --> 01:05:25,954
Not one.
How can you know a gay?

888
01:05:26,154 --> 01:05:29,234
That's what I'm saying.
Maybe some boxers are gay.

889
01:05:29,434 --> 01:05:31,754
Those bastards are sick,
they're everywhere.

890
01:05:31,954 --> 01:05:33,554
Really sick, man.

891
01:05:33,754 --> 01:05:36,714
With so many hot babes around,
they still fuck their asses?

892
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:39,754
Really? You told everybody
you fucked Sandra in the ass.

893
01:05:39,954 --> 01:05:41,914
-That's not the same.
-No?

894
01:05:42,114 --> 01:05:44,754
He's right.
The ass rules.

895
01:05:44,954 --> 01:05:47,394
I mean, it's tighter than the pussy.

896
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:50,554
Can you believe this?

897
01:05:52,394 --> 01:05:54,754
Come on, do Wendy for us!

898
01:06:01,954 --> 01:06:04,194
What's this hillbilly shit?

899
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,714
Submit to the power of Goth,
slaves!

900
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,274
Switch it off!

901
01:06:12,474 --> 01:06:14,434
No, really.

902
01:06:14,994 --> 01:06:16,834
This folk music is killing me.

903
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:19,154
Oh yeah? I can see
that you're bummed out.

904
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:21,314
Playing Spin the Bottle?

905
01:06:21,674 --> 01:06:24,714
-Just fooling around.
-I want in!

906
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:29,314
Are you sure? If I start telling
people that Mary Shelley played...

907
01:06:29,514 --> 01:06:32,234
There are no survivors
if you play with her.

908
01:06:32,874 --> 01:06:34,954
So, what does the next one do?

909
01:06:35,154 --> 01:06:38,354
The next person, if it's a female,

910
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:40,354
will kiss Miksa!

911
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:42,594
French kiss him, actually!

912
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,314
-If it's a male?
-No way.

913
01:06:47,314 --> 01:06:49,354
-I don't believe this.
-Don't be scared.

914
01:06:51,234 --> 01:06:53,194
What do you want from me?

915
01:06:53,394 --> 01:06:55,314
Come on Sandra, stop pretending.

916
01:06:55,514 --> 01:06:57,834
You've been fucking around
with him all night!

917
01:06:58,034 --> 01:07:01,114
Come on, it's a game! Kiss him!

918
01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:03,274
I mean, if you're not embarrassed.

919
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:08,314
These are your friends, maybe
they can get a hard-on for you.

920
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:19,154
Miksa, you're a real stud!

921
01:07:19,354 --> 01:07:21,954
Way to go, man!

922
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:27,354
Wow. You're such a whore, Sandra.

923
01:07:27,554 --> 01:07:30,394
In that clip at least you sucked
a football player's cock,

924
01:07:30,594 --> 01:07:32,314
but now, this nerd?

925
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:33,754
What did you say?

926
01:07:33,954 --> 01:07:36,034
-It was a joke!
-No, it wasn't.

927
01:07:36,234 --> 01:07:37,994
How can you say that to me?

928
01:07:38,194 --> 01:07:40,274
-You didn't know?
-Her?

929
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:43,074
Everybody knows you posted
that clip online yourself.

930
01:07:43,274 --> 01:07:45,794
-I posted it?
-Everybody knows.

931
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:48,594
-Are you sure I posted it?
-I'm sure.

932
01:07:48,794 --> 01:07:50,994
Are you also sure
you live uptown?

933
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:53,154
Or maybe in the Ripanj village?

934
01:07:53,354 --> 01:07:54,874
What?

935
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:59,634
You parade the outfits I gave
you in the village?

936
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:02,314
You never gave me a thing,
we swapped.

937
01:08:02,514 --> 01:08:05,714
Yeah, Benetton shorts for
a Chinese T-shirt.

938
01:08:05,914 --> 01:08:08,234
I wouldn't be caught dead
in that crap!

939
01:08:08,434 --> 01:08:11,674
Plus, you spend days at my place,
and I've never been in your house.

940
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:14,034
-Nonsense.
-Ever saw Jelena's place?

941
01:08:14,234 --> 01:08:16,834
No, because she's redneck
who's granny keeps

942
01:08:17,034 --> 01:08:19,154
chickens in the yard.

943
01:08:19,354 --> 01:08:23,074
Why don't you put that on your blog?
Because you're ashamed!

944
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:25,034
-You're drunk.
-Yes.

945
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,034
But I'm not trailer-trash,
and you are.

946
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:30,554
I don't believe you, I mean,
I don't get it.

947
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:33,234
First of all,
why does it matter if I...

948
01:08:33,434 --> 01:08:36,994
Of course it fucking doesn't matter!

949
01:08:37,194 --> 01:08:39,834
You're my friend! I don't
give a shit where you live!

950
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:43,234
But I'm sick of hearing
lies about your home,

951
01:08:43,434 --> 01:08:46,234
your family, about Veselin...
-How do you know of Veselin?

952
01:08:46,434 --> 01:08:49,474
I know, 'coz you didn't log off
when you used my laptop!

953
01:08:49,674 --> 01:08:53,074
I didn't tell anybody because
I thought you were my friend!

954
01:08:53,274 --> 01:08:55,234
So, why say it now?! Fuck.

955
01:08:55,434 --> 01:08:58,954
How could you call me a whore?!
Do you fucking realize...

956
01:08:59,154 --> 01:09:02,274
-Sandra, wait...
-You're a piece of shit!

957
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:15,474
I don't believe this.

958
01:11:08,037 --> 01:11:10,317
I was born during the war.

959
01:11:10,501 --> 01:11:12,461
My parents had to...

960
01:11:13,274 --> 01:11:17,394
Whatever. When we came here,
they had no personal documents.

961
01:11:17,594 --> 01:11:21,274
That's why it says here
that I was born in Belgrade.

962
01:11:21,474 --> 01:11:25,354
I didn't want to show this to Ana.
None of her business.

963
01:11:25,554 --> 01:11:28,394
-Right.
-But it made me look like a retard.

964
01:11:28,594 --> 01:11:32,034
Sometimes I say dumb shit like that.

965
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:35,562
Why? You were right.

966
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:38,512
Maybe you were wrong
about that song, but...

967
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:43,834
But when you talked about your family...
I really didn't know.

968
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:48,394
I can only imagine how does it feel
to be expelled from your home.

969
01:11:50,174 --> 01:11:52,014
My Granny told me...

970
01:11:54,194 --> 01:11:57,554
The communists took away everything
from us after the WWII.

971
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:02,474
My family was true nobility
before the war.

972
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:07,380
And our history teacher never mentions
the crimes against families like yours.

973
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:11,434
Because she's a daughter of
a communist officer...

974
01:12:11,634 --> 01:12:13,594
Really?

975
01:12:19,554 --> 01:12:22,274
She gave me a 'B',
did you see that?

976
01:12:23,514 --> 01:12:25,674
She didn't blink.

977
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:28,514
And I studied.

978
01:12:28,714 --> 01:12:35,114
I studied hard, precisely to avoid
her communist provocations.

979
01:12:35,964 --> 01:12:37,830
I studied to get an 'A'.

980
01:12:40,034 --> 01:12:43,634
-I deserved an 'A'.
-You did.

981
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:48,794
''Do you think
that Prince Paul was a patriot?''

982
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:50,474
Prince Paul Karadjordjevic,

983
01:12:50,674 --> 01:12:53,314
who left that magnificent collection
to the Museum?

984
01:12:53,514 --> 01:12:55,114
And I have to defend him

985
01:12:55,314 --> 01:12:58,554
from a woman whose husband smears
the Serbs and calls that ''art''.

986
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:00,714
-What?
-You don't know?

987
01:13:00,914 --> 01:13:03,834
-You heard about ''Love''?
-The essay we did?

988
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:06,594
No. That new exhibition!

989
01:13:09,314 --> 01:13:12,834
I would’ve shown you his filth
if I only had my cell phone.

990
01:13:13,034 --> 01:13:16,554
-The Patriarch and Novak Djokovic...
-I know about that. What of it?

991
01:13:16,754 --> 01:13:20,794
The ''artist'' is Olja's husband.

992
01:13:21,714 --> 01:13:26,514
Her husband, can you believe it?
They do whatever they want.

993
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:30,194
And then she's surprised when
someone spills paint over her.

994
01:13:30,394 --> 01:13:34,314
They should have
tarred and feathered her.

995
01:13:34,514 --> 01:13:38,714
Now she pays a victim for getting
splashed a bit with her commie color.

996
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,634
Her husband uses the same color
for his sick paintings.

997
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,074
I didn't know that he was
her husband.

998
01:13:44,274 --> 01:13:46,234
What else can surprise you?

999
01:13:47,794 --> 01:13:50,474
The fact that she keeps
us locked in here?

1000
01:13:50,674 --> 01:13:52,874
Keeps all of us here,
to be accurate.

1001
01:13:53,354 --> 01:13:55,354
Not just the ones who did it.

1002
01:13:55,554 --> 01:13:56,874
And who did it?

1003
01:13:57,074 --> 01:14:00,994
She can ask her husband.
I didn't do it, that's for sure.

1004
01:14:01,514 --> 01:14:03,954
I just informed Tadija
about the exhibition.

1005
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:06,834
But it was
in all the papers, anyhow.

1006
01:14:09,394 --> 01:14:11,194
OK, who's next?

1007
01:14:11,202 --> 01:14:13,162
Give it to me!

1008
01:14:14,286 --> 01:14:15,874
You can take my share.

1009
01:14:23,994 --> 01:14:26,317
That's all?

1010
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:31,130
I thought that Dule brought
some more stuff for the excursion.

1011
01:14:33,794 --> 01:14:35,594
Dude, I ordered two...

1012
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:42,794
I ordered two grams, and Tadija brought
just a half. Threw away the rest.

1013
01:14:44,194 --> 01:14:45,754
So?

1014
01:14:45,762 --> 01:14:48,282
-What now?
-I've got no idea.

1015
01:14:48,674 --> 01:14:50,634
Ask your daddy?

1016
01:14:50,874 --> 01:14:52,594
That's funny. My dad, again?

1017
01:14:52,794 --> 01:14:54,674
You could think of something else.

1018
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:58,314
It's not my fault
your old man's on welfare.

1019
01:14:58,554 --> 01:14:59,754
What did you say?

1020
01:15:03,114 --> 01:15:04,874
I said, it's not my...

1021
01:15:06,954 --> 01:15:09,034
I'll fucking kill you!

1022
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:10,394
Tadija, bro!

1023
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:13,194
I'm not your brother,
you rich cunt!

1024
01:15:14,634 --> 01:15:16,914
That's our Dule, Tadija!

1025
01:15:17,114 --> 01:15:18,354
Fuck you, and Dule!

1026
01:15:18,554 --> 01:15:21,114
Don't you ever
talk about my dad! Ever!

1027
01:15:21,874 --> 01:15:23,594
Did you see that?

1028
01:15:23,794 --> 01:15:25,514
He keeps talking shit
about my dad!

1029
01:15:25,714 --> 01:15:30,074
And then? When I mention
his dad, he wants to fight!

1030
01:15:30,274 --> 01:15:33,114
The Olja action was all his idea,
so what does he want now?

1031
01:15:33,314 --> 01:15:35,154
I just said that Dule should film it,

1032
01:15:35,354 --> 01:15:37,634
everything else
was Tadija's idea, right?

1033
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:39,634
That's right.

1034
01:15:41,394 --> 01:15:43,474
Where are you going?

1035
01:15:43,482 --> 01:15:45,202
I'm going to fuck myself.

1036
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:47,249
You should go back to Tadija.

1037
01:15:49,154 --> 01:15:51,914
-They made that video, you know?
-I knew it.

1038
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:55,954
I heard them the other day.

1039
01:15:56,634 --> 01:15:58,354
When Sofija got a 'B'.

1040
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,090
You should tell someone.

1041
01:16:04,295 --> 01:16:07,015
No, dude.
You can tell whoever you want.

1042
01:16:07,434 --> 01:16:10,274
I won't have anything
to do with it.

1043
01:16:12,474 --> 01:16:14,474
I just beat those bastards up.

1044
01:16:18,434 --> 01:16:19,954
-Got a T-shirt?
-What?

1045
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:22,114
A T-shirt?

1046
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:25,074
Yeah, I got it.

1047
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:33,314
You knocked him out like a pro
yesterday.

1048
01:16:36,514 --> 01:16:38,794
-You train something?
-Boxing.

1049
01:16:42,954 --> 01:16:44,354
It shows.

1050
01:16:55,922 --> 01:16:57,322
Motherfucker!

1051
01:17:04,194 --> 01:17:05,994
Too cold?

1052
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,850
Where do you think you're going?

1053
01:17:35,714 --> 01:17:38,554
-It's okay.
-Get out of here!

1054
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:39,954
Just stay cool...

1055
01:17:40,154 --> 01:17:44,234
Get out of here,
fucking faggot! Out!

1056
01:18:31,735 --> 01:18:34,575
Jelena, open the door,
I know you're in there.

1057
01:18:38,754 --> 01:18:41,354
What do you want from me now?!

1058
01:18:41,554 --> 01:18:43,714
Nothing. Just to see
that you're okay.

1059
01:18:43,773 --> 01:18:45,013
Okay?

1060
01:18:54,194 --> 01:18:56,394
Do you want me
to call Strahinja?

1061
01:18:56,594 --> 01:19:00,194
I'm okay, Isidora!
Just don't call anyone!

1062
01:19:00,874 --> 01:19:02,354
Okay.

1063
01:19:03,794 --> 01:19:06,394
Then I'll stay here
until you get out.

1064
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:16,554
Strahinja, my ass!

1065
01:19:16,754 --> 01:19:18,634
I mean, I never...

1066
01:19:18,834 --> 01:19:20,554
We never...

1067
01:19:20,754 --> 01:19:22,714
I'm a fucking virgin!

1068
01:20:04,274 --> 01:20:05,754
Want a sandwich?

1069
01:20:09,985 --> 01:20:11,225
Thanks.

1070
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,640
Matija, what are you doing?

1071
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:36,474
Sofija, I'm sorry, I...

1072
01:20:38,994 --> 01:20:40,536
I just...

1073
01:20:41,735 --> 01:20:43,975
I just thought that...

1074
01:20:44,394 --> 01:20:46,114
What?

1075
01:20:46,314 --> 01:20:49,154
I just thought that...

1076
01:20:49,354 --> 01:20:51,314
You and I...

1077
01:21:38,474 --> 01:21:40,034
Fuck, dude.

1078
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:47,914
I mean, it's gonna be okay.

1079
01:21:49,194 --> 01:21:50,994
Like hell it will.

1080
01:21:52,954 --> 01:21:56,914
It's not like it's the
end of the world, right?

1081
01:21:59,566 --> 01:22:01,366
Yes, it is.

1082
01:22:07,474 --> 01:22:09,034
I don't give a fuck!

1083
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:15,981
You're my only true friend
in this world.

1084
01:22:21,973 --> 01:22:23,653
What's wrong?

1085
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:28,154
Nothing.

1086
01:22:29,994 --> 01:22:32,314
Come on, tell me what
the fuck is wrong?

1087
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:35,750
You never called me
to go with you.

1088
01:22:35,758 --> 01:22:37,518
Go where?

1089
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:40,233
-To action.
-What action?

1090
01:22:40,754 --> 01:22:42,674
The teacher, the red paint action.

1091
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:47,194
You're one fucking moron.
Fuck, man.

1092
01:22:47,394 --> 01:22:50,634
I told that jerk to call you, but...

1093
01:22:50,642 --> 01:22:52,602
No, you haven't.

1094
01:22:53,274 --> 01:22:54,950
I overheard you talking to him.

1095
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:58,518
You said that I'm retarded and
that I'll rat on you, 1 00%.

1096
01:23:01,173 --> 01:23:05,373
When it's just the two of us, it's
cool, but when someone else is there,

1097
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:07,621
I'm a retard, I'm a rat,

1098
01:23:08,154 --> 01:23:09,834
I go to the time machine.

1099
01:23:10,034 --> 01:23:11,754
''I go to the time machine''.

1100
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:14,194
''Because Tadija doesn't love me''.

1101
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:16,794
Are you out of your mind,
little faggot?

1102
01:23:16,994 --> 01:23:19,434
Why can't you at east speak
like a normal person?

1103
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:22,314
Why can't you be normal
for once in your life?!

1104
01:23:22,322 --> 01:23:23,762
Of course I didn't call you!

1105
01:23:23,849 --> 01:23:26,849
Just look at you,
so miserable and ugly.

1106
01:23:27,354 --> 01:23:29,314
Who would call you?

1107
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,194
I'm sorry.

1108
01:24:07,634 --> 01:24:09,754
Did you see this?

1109
01:24:13,634 --> 01:24:15,954
That story in the papers
Matija talked about?

1110
01:24:16,154 --> 01:24:18,994
It's all true, you know?

1111
01:24:19,194 --> 01:24:21,154
That was me.

1112
01:24:21,914 --> 01:24:25,714
Before I came here, I went to school
in another part of town.

1113
01:24:27,114 --> 01:24:29,674
There was a crew there,
bunch of morons.

1114
01:24:29,874 --> 01:24:31,994
I thought to myself,

1115
01:24:32,194 --> 01:24:37,154
if I act, if I blend in,
no one will notice anything.

1116
01:24:37,354 --> 01:24:40,994
I'm a jock, the chicks dig me...

1117
01:24:42,114 --> 01:24:45,132
I watch out for my every move,
not to look too femme.

1118
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:46,345
Tops.

1119
01:24:47,634 --> 01:24:50,074
Just like in grade school.

1120
01:24:50,994 --> 01:24:55,634
And then one day,
this girl, she was my best friend,

1121
01:24:55,642 --> 01:24:59,442
she took my phone, she said
she was looking for a song,

1122
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:02,554
but she really
wanted to browse.

1123
01:25:03,274 --> 01:25:04,874
She browsed, all right.

1124
01:25:05,074 --> 01:25:07,354
She found some messages
and some pictures.

1125
01:25:07,554 --> 01:25:09,954
With some guy from Grindr.

1126
01:25:11,554 --> 01:25:13,074
What did she do?

1127
01:25:14,794 --> 01:25:17,794
Print screen
and straight to Facebook.

1128
01:25:23,782 --> 01:25:25,302
Fuck, man...

1129
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:29,351
In 30 minutes...

1130
01:25:30,714 --> 01:25:32,394
In 30 fucking minutes...

1131
01:25:34,034 --> 01:25:36,394
The whole school was, like...

1132
01:25:37,594 --> 01:25:39,274
''Faggot!''

1133
01:25:39,474 --> 01:25:41,434
''Homo!''

1134
01:25:41,994 --> 01:25:44,234
''Butt rider!'' Hell, man.

1135
01:25:47,897 --> 01:25:50,154
One guy threw shit on my head.

1136
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:57,194
He actually crapped in a plastic bag
and spilled it over my head.

1137
01:25:57,394 --> 01:25:59,354
Literally.

1138
01:26:00,434 --> 01:26:03,634
Each day I go to school, I throw up.

1139
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:05,714
Every morning.

1140
01:26:05,914 --> 01:26:08,354
I can't tell my Mom,
I don't know how.

1141
01:26:10,354 --> 01:26:12,674
I lost track of
how many times I got beaten up.

1142
01:26:16,954 --> 01:26:18,674
Until one day,

1143
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:21,154
I go to school
and I run into this bully, Ruzic.

1144
01:26:21,354 --> 01:26:23,714
One of those Serb nationalists.

1145
01:26:23,722 --> 01:26:26,474
He comes to me
and spits in my face.

1146
01:26:28,019 --> 01:26:30,859
I smack him over the face.

1147
01:26:32,474 --> 01:26:35,114
So, after school, three of them...

1148
01:26:35,314 --> 01:26:39,434
Dude...
three of then, and I'm alone.

1149
01:26:39,754 --> 01:26:42,874
And they start to pound,
and pound, and hammer.

1150
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:46,714
They kick me, they don't stop,
and all in the head.

1151
01:26:46,914 --> 01:26:49,874
The blood's all over me,
I don't know if I'm alive or dead...

1152
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:53,010
I look up, one of them says,

1153
01:26:53,554 --> 01:26:56,314
''You like to suck cock, do you?
You like to suck cock?''

1154
01:26:56,322 --> 01:26:58,842
''You really love sucking it, right?''

1155
01:27:02,074 --> 01:27:04,314
That's the last thing I remember.

1156
01:27:10,314 --> 01:27:11,914
I fell into a coma.

1157
01:27:13,154 --> 01:27:14,674
For three days.

1158
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:20,687
Skull fracture,
three broken ribs,

1159
01:27:20,942 --> 01:27:25,782
and that knife. Missed by
a couple of millimeters.

1160
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:36,074
After that, I came out to my mom.

1161
01:27:37,274 --> 01:27:39,754
We managed to survive that.

1162
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,954
Then, I started to work out.

1163
01:27:44,962 --> 01:27:48,002
I train every day,
like my life depends on it.

1164
01:27:48,474 --> 01:27:51,434
They can wonder
if I'm top or bottom.

1165
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:56,634
But if anyone touches me,
I'll beat the shit out of him.

1166
01:28:55,131 --> 01:28:57,731
<i>I really don't know what love is.</i>

1167
01:28:59,454 --> 01:29:03,294
<i>I mean...I can give you
a textbook definition, but</i>

1168
01:29:03,674 --> 01:29:06,434
<i>you’re not looking for that.</i>

1169
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,714
<i>I'm sorry I read your essays.</i>

1170
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:14,914
<i>I  shouldn 't have.</i>

1171
01:29:15,674 --> 01:29:18,514
<i>Those are your private thoughts.</i>

1172
01:29:19,594 --> 01:29:22,316
<i>But just for a second, I wanted to see
how does it feel...</i>

1173
01:29:22,324 --> 01:29:24,113
<i>not being me.</i>

1174
01:29:29,674 --> 01:29:31,514
<i>You've got friends.</i>

1175
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:37,874
<i>You love each other, hate each other,
fight and make up,</i>

1176
01:29:38,074 --> 01:29:41,114
<i>and you think
that's the end of the world.</i>

1177
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,421
<i>You've got no idea how lucky you are.</i>

1178
01:29:49,714 --> 01:29:53,954
<i>I  know that the problems of all those
Jelenas, Tadijas, Strahinjas</i>

1179
01:29:54,154 --> 01:29:56,114

1182
01:30:09,274 --> 01:30:10,674
<i>That's okay.</i>

1183
01:30:12,437 --> 01:30:16,198
<i>I think that it's always been
that way, and it always will be.</i>

1184
01:30:19,354 --> 01:30:21,114
<i>I only know that...</i>

1185
01:30:24,234 --> 01:30:26,283
<i>If I died today</i>

1186
01:30:27,981 --> 01:30:31,018
