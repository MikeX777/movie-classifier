1
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:10,523
Hello.

2
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,927
Good morning.
What brings you here?

3
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:15,367
I have an urgent letter for you.

4
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:16,197
Thanks.

5
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:56,121
Make yourself at home.
And stay as long as you like.

6
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:57,726
Are you going somewhere?

7
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,401
I have to leave immediately.

8
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,806
Fernando Carneiro

9
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:09,475
Alberto?

10
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,882
You look like an outlaw.

11
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:24,996
I'll pass by your house tonight.

12
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,120
I started working at Don Fernandes' place.

13
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,643
And now I live there, too.

14
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:28,363
It was dangerous living here alone
with he boy.

15
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,643
And how is my nephew?

16
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,400
He's at home.

17
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,443
I came as soon as I heard
you were back.

18
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,760
Why aren't you dressed in black?

19
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:58,605
The boss doesn't want
other people's sadness in his house.

20
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,277
I've come back to
take you away with me.

21
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:48,277
Your brother was killed
at the Hill Reed Bed.

22
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,764
But where exactly?

23
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:01,359
They say it happened
over near Pimenta's land.

24
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,083
I'll go and fetch the sheep.

25
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:13,599
Things are getting worse all the time.
Your brother was killed by bandits.

26
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,207
There are ambushes in the reed beds.

27
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:20,118
It seems like most of the sheep
have been stolen.

28
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:25,641
There won't be many left for us.

29
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,165
I'm here to avenge my brother's death.

30
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:00,039
I have to go to work.

31
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,640
They'll have noticed I'm missing by now

32
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,195
I'll pass by later to say goodbye.

33
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,960
You don't have to wear those rags any more.

34
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:49,636
Your brother's clothes are over there.
Take whatever you want.

35
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:57,476
He would've liked that.

36
00:25:57,727 --> 00:26:02,437
I was sad to hear that
you'd left the mission over there.

37
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:06,323
Thanks for writing to let me know.

38
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:08,326
And I'm sorry.

39
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:11,965
You were the last person
I wanted to hurt.

40
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:17,366
But I wasn't born to follow rules.

41
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:22,127
I had to breathe in my own way.

42
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:25,802
And seeing other worlds
brought with it other needs.

43
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,926
I just hope you don't get lost, my son.

44
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,437
What do you plan to do now?

45
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:35,127
I came to sort out my family's affairs.
And to take what belongs to me.

46
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,927
So, are you planning on taking Noémia
and the child with you?

47
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:38,803
Yes.

48
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:42,397
They're my responsibility now.

49
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,364
Be careful, my son.

50
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,966
That might not be what she wants.

51
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:50,841
Is there something I should know, Father?

52
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:33,723
— What are you doing here?
— Fetch Fernandes for me.

53
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:35,638
Come round the back.

54
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:14,477
Go on.

55
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,318
Give your uncle a kiss.

56
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:40,400
Where are you going armed like that?

57
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,363
I'm going to find your sheep.
And the shepherd's murderer, too.

58
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,597
How much is the reward?

59
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:52,438
My workers are all scared.
After what happened to your brother...

60
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:56,767
I want to know where they are
and who's got them.

61
00:28:56,767 --> 00:29:01,522
As soon as I heard you were back,
I knew there'd be trouble.

62
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,197
But I'd rather it was you
that fetched the sheep.

63
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:08,440
The only trouble I'm bringing is for you.

64
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,605
Just because your old man died
and now you're the Lord of the land,

65
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:14,207
it doesn't mean that
the people here are your slaves.

66
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:17,517
I see you don't plan to stick around
for too long.

67
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:23,318
When I leave I'm taking Noémia
and my nephew far away from here.

68
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:26,718
We'll see about that...

69
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,684
I need a horse.

70
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:34,687
A shepherd on horseback.
This I've got to see.

71
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:36,167
Rent it to me.

72
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,522
I'll pay you back with a week's work.

73
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:44,035
Just bear in mind that my horse
is worth much more than your twenty sheep.

74
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:46,036
Paulinho!

75
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,286
Prepare him a horse.

76
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,127
Stop!

77
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,447
What's going on here?

78
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:56,767
No one passes here.

79
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,644
Don't move a muscle.

80
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,927
What's your name, traveller?

81
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:11,367
Who wants to know?

82
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,925
António Bacelo.

83
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:16,636
Captain of the Royal Guard.
At your service.

84
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,725
Alberto Carneiro — mountain shepherd.

85
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,284
A shepherd?

86
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:25,927
Riding a horse?

87
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:28,521
I'm on my way
to retrieve some stolen sheep.

88
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:33,087
Then I have to tell you that
you must pay a toll.

89
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:34,527
But this route is free.

90
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:35,403
Listen...

91
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:38,360
your horse grazes, does it not?

92
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:40,558
And drinks water, too.

93
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,002
So you have to pay.

94
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,407
I don't owe anything to anybody.

95
00:34:45,407 --> 00:34:49,847
Besides, I plan to return this way
with a flock of sheep.

96
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:52,600
And then I will pay what's due.

97
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:58,439
Then I must inform you that
you shall not pass...

98
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:01,447
without me defending myself
against such disrespect.

99
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:04,644
Listen, I don't want any trouble.
I just want to be on my way.

100
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:23,487
According to Article 10 of Chapter 9
of "The Duelling Code",

101
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,727
you have the right
to choose your weapon.

102
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:28,241
Or you may use your own,
if you so wish.

103
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:31,240
Choose your weapon!

104
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:34,677
If you leave me no choice,
mine is already loaded.

105
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:39,323
You have to the right to choose
the place of combat.

106
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:43,005
Right here will do.

107
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:46,918
No. It must be on flat land.

108
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:54,161
One, two, three...

109
00:35:55,447 --> 00:36:00,475
four, five, six, seven, eight...

110
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:03,562
nine, ten.

111
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:32,127
According to The Duelling Code,
when one of the participants is not killed,

112
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:35,327
but merely wounded,
he has the right to revenge.

113
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:38,239
I'm sorry, but I don't intend to kill you.

114
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:11,967
So what can I get you?

115
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,082
A glass of wine.

116
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,127
What brings you to these parts?

117
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:31,446
I'm a shepherd.

118
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:35,403
So where are your sheep then?

119
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:37,005
I'm looking for them.

120
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,767
Some of them were stolen

121
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:41,564
when they killed my brother.

122
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:46,963
The others have been found
and retained by the King's officers.

123
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:49,887
Where are you from?

124
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,161
Covas da Serra.

125
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,405
So you're António Carneiro's son?

126
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:55,317
That's right.

127
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,887
I knew you when you were just a lad.

128
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:00,367
But there are so many bandits
around nowadays.

129
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,047
Weren't you a priest?

130
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,356
And I thought you went to America, too.

131
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:06,483
I was never ordained as a priest.

132
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:09,767
So now you've come back
to this damned place to get into trouble?

133
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,600
I had to come
and settle my brother's debt.

134
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:15,007
Apparently he was killed by a gang.

135
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:18,238
Watch what you say, son.
The walls have ears.

136
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:21,047
Unfortunately, things aren't
what they used to be.

137
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,806
You can't even trust the King's men now.

138
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:27,087
Yesterday I had the pleasure
of meeting Bacelo.

139
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:29,607
He wanted me to pay a toll to pass.

140
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:31,207
But he regretted it.

141
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,640
Careful!

142
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,042
Things are really different nowadays.

143
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:38,363
You'll still be crossing
Pimenta's land today.

144
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,238
Keep your money!

145
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:46,799
And this one's on me,

146
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:49,724
in memory of your brother.

147
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:51,246
Thanks very much.

148
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:06,762
Good morning.

149
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:07,687
Good morning.

150
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:09,167
My name is Alberto Carneiro.

151
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,887
I've come to fetch the flock.

152
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:13,927
We've been waiting for someone
for the past few weeks.

153
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:16,167
Are these the only ones left?

154
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,761
These and some others
scattered about here and there.

155
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:22,207
They didn't take them all
because they can't hide them.

156
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:25,487
And things left unhidden
may soon be found.

157
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:29,967
Careful! There are things
that one would rather not find out.

158
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:33,127
The agreement is four sheep per hundred
for you, right?

159
00:45:33,127 --> 00:45:35,127
That's what was agreed.

160
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:36,847
So it's ten animals then.

161
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,007
Nine and a half is no good to anybody.

162
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:39,927
Right?

163
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:40,996
Thanks.

164
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,124
Take the ones you want.

165
00:45:43,927 --> 00:45:46,887
What I'd like to do
is come back for them tomorrow.

166
00:45:46,887 --> 00:45:49,487
I'm going to try and find the rest.

167
00:45:49,487 --> 00:45:50,636
It's a deal.

168
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:53,727
I've waited for this long,
I might as well wait another day, eh?

169
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:55,001
Thanks very much.

170
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:52,841
Sit down.

171
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:58,004
Come and eat with us.
You look famished.

172
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,042
Thanks.

173
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:29,567
Don't be scared.
We don't hurt hungry people.

174
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:31,717
Our issues are with the authorities.

175
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,923
Discontent is everywhere.

176
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:37,687
Yet the king is proclaimed
as a great saviour wherever he goes.

177
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:38,961
Dog of Hell!

178
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:44,446
We should do the same to him
as we did to his brother and father.

179
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,876
What are you doing around these parts?

180
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:55,682
I've been abroad for a few years.

181
00:48:57,207 --> 00:49:00,358
Things were very different when I left.

182
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:05,447
Now I'm back because bandits
killed my brother. He was a shepherd.

183
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:07,278
So I'm here to settle the score.

184
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:09,680
Do you know who did it?

185
00:49:09,807 --> 00:49:12,367
He was passing by Pimenta's land.

186
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:17,798
I was hoping you might know who did it.

187
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:23,757
Put it down!

188
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:25,679
It wasn't us. Put it down!

189
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:33,683
The only argument we have is with
the King and his men.

190
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:10,007
I'm sorry for having taken you for bandits.

191
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,281
Apologies accepted.

192
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:17,600
And don't worry, Pimenta's men
won't come anywhere near here.

193
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:30,047
Some of the village's sheep
are grazing over near Marvao.

194
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:32,561
The only problem there is the King's men.

195
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:41,475
We're heading that way.
We can help you, if you want.

196
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:48,276
Sometimes a man on his own goes further
than a whole battalion.

197
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:51,203
And you've got your own fight.

198
00:50:51,607 --> 00:50:52,960
I've got mine.

199
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:57,362
Thanks very much though.

200
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,447
— Good morning.
— Good morning.

201
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:06,767
— Which way is town?
— That way.

202
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:09,087
What about the Hanged Man's Field?
Is it in the same direction?

203
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,047
Yes. It's that way, too.

204
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:10,877
Thank you very much.

205
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:41,727
Take it easy, my friend.

206
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:44,087
— What do you want?
— I'm not here to cause trouble.

207
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:46,282
— Who do these sheep belong to?
— They're mine.

208
00:52:46,807 --> 00:52:49,116
And yet they have different brandings...

209
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,806
Let's sort out who these sheep
really belong to.

210
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:02,438
You're going to come with me
and clarify that.

211
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:16,244
Please sit down.

212
00:53:19,727 --> 00:53:20,876
Thank you.

213
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:23,678
So what brings you here?

214
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,287
I've come to tell you
I've found a meadow with stolen sheep,

215
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,767
just a few kilometers from here.
Some of them are mine...

216
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:31,007
And you are?

217
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,077
Alberto Carneiro, mountain shepherd.

218
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:35,727
Aren't you the one who
wounded Captain Bacelo?

219
00:53:35,727 --> 00:53:38,487
That was in self—defence. He tried
to rob me in the name of the State.

220
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:42,087
That's a matter for Justice to decide.
In the meantime, I've orders to arrest you.

221
00:53:42,087 --> 00:53:44,601
— What about my sheep?
— How do you know those sheep are yours?

222
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:46,607
My brother was murdered

223
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:48,727
and most of our sheep were stolen
back in the Autumn.

224
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:52,567
You know that much, for sure.
And this gentleman's sheep had our brand.

225
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:55,639
We'll look into the sheep issue.

226
00:53:55,927 --> 00:53:58,043
But you shall not leave here.

227
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:02,127
And don't worry too much —
I've heard that Don Fernandes

228
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:04,163
has already sent
two of his labourers to fetch them.

229
00:54:08,047 --> 00:54:09,526
Give me your gun.

230
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:53,357
Good morning.

231
00:54:54,087 --> 00:54:55,202
Good morning.

232
00:55:38,487 --> 00:55:39,920
Américo.

233
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:43,076
Alberto Carneiro.

234
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:46,960
Alberto Carneiro?

235
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:50,440
I'm a shepherd.

236
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:33,636
Eh?

237
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:43,127
I'm translating a book into my language.

238
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:46,039
So it can be read and taught here.

239
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:58,161
I don't understand.

240
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:03,040
You've got half an hour outside.
Step to it!

241
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:21,687
Don't come any closer!

242
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:22,836
Stay calm!

243
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:25,606
I only want a light.

244
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,318
Now clear off!

245
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,927
Relax!

246
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:02,287
It doesn't look too difficult
to break out of here.

247
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:03,515
So stay cool.

248
01:01:28,927 --> 01:01:30,047
Good evening, gentleman.

249
01:01:30,047 --> 01:01:31,116
Evening.

250
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:04,596
Are you ready?

251
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:23,000
We're going to escape.

252
01:02:23,647 --> 01:02:25,399
Would you like to come with us?

253
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:28,477
No.

254
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:30,799
I'm only here for the night.

255
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:46,887
Can we have one of your guitar strings?

256
01:02:46,887 --> 01:02:48,320
Is one enough?

257
01:02:50,207 --> 01:02:52,038
That'll be more than enough.

258
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:58,717
Thanks.

259
01:03:00,727 --> 01:03:01,603
Let's do it.

260
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:09,285
Don't worry. We're safe here.

261
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:14,159
They'll only find out
we passed this way tomorrow.

262
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:43,406
Take a rest.

263
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:56,161
It's better than freezing to death.

264
01:07:44,447 --> 01:07:46,967
How could anyone
escape from a prison like that?

265
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:49,407
I don't know what to say.
I've no idea how it happened.

266
01:07:49,407 --> 01:07:52,447
And to cap it all, you tell me that
you don't have enough men to catch him?

267
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,436
I don't.

268
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:56,127
They have to send them from HQ.

269
01:07:56,127 --> 01:08:00,405
We've only got a few men here. And to
be honest, it's not a serious offence.

270
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:03,723
Besides, they won't get far together.

271
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:09,485
Let me tell you then.

272
01:08:10,807 --> 01:08:13,526
I will catch him myself.

273
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:33,287
Have you seen a shepherd with a moustache
and a black man?

274
01:09:33,287 --> 01:09:35,287
Up here in the hills
no one has passed through.

275
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:38,127
— If you see them, turn them in.
— Why are you after them?

276
01:09:38,127 --> 01:09:39,719
No questions!

277
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:23,206
Alberto! Alberto!

278
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,358
I have to head upstream, Américo.

279
01:10:37,047 --> 01:10:39,766
I'll help you find your way soon.

280
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:43,366
But in the meantime, stick with me.
Come on!

281
01:12:51,687 --> 01:12:52,642
Stop!

282
01:12:53,647 --> 01:12:54,875
Put your hands up!

283
01:12:55,327 --> 01:12:56,680
Put your damn hands up!

284
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:22,687
And to cap it all, they're armed.
Let's kill them. Let's kill them now.

285
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,767
Stay calm.
No one is killing anybody.

286
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,687
We'll take them to mother
and do whatever she tells us to.

287
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:29,447
To mother?
Mother doesn't need to know about this.

288
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,487
— Stay calm, friends.
— Stay calm?

289
01:13:31,487 --> 01:13:34,807
We just want to go our way.
We didn't know this was anyone's land.

290
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:36,126
Shut your mouth!

291
01:13:40,967 --> 01:13:43,162
Come on! Walk in front of us.

292
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:45,318
You hear me? Move it!

293
01:13:45,847 --> 01:13:47,247
Walk ahead of me!

294
01:13:47,247 --> 01:13:48,362
Damn it! Move!

295
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,641
Mummy...

296
01:14:51,527 --> 01:14:53,040
We caught them.

297
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:16,319
Have them brought in.

298
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,798
Bring them in.

299
01:15:37,007 --> 01:15:38,527
What are you doing here?

300
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:41,167
We're just passing through.
We mean no harm.

301
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:43,287
They came armed.
Show her his weapon.

302
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:44,276
Shut up!

303
01:15:44,527 --> 01:15:46,165
Put those guns away.

304
01:15:54,487 --> 01:15:56,047
Who are you running away from?

305
01:15:56,047 --> 01:15:59,084
I was arrested for refusing
to be robbed by the State.

306
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:05,277
And you?

307
01:16:13,847 --> 01:16:15,678
Don't you speak Portuguese?

308
01:16:15,807 --> 01:16:16,683
No.

309
01:16:19,247 --> 01:16:22,922
Bacelo is after you.

310
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:26,360
Everybody knows you're on the run.

311
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:31,279
And being together will
just make it easier to catch you.

312
01:16:32,847 --> 01:16:35,236
He won't give up.

313
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:38,925
He's like a dog.

314
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:45,002
And there's only one way
to escape his sense of smell.

315
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:50,167
Arrange the transport.

316
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:51,207
But mummy...

317
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,038
Arrange their transport!

318
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:54,482
Our transport?

319
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:57,440
Your transport!

320
01:16:59,287 --> 01:17:00,242
Yes, mummy.

321
01:17:01,927 --> 01:17:04,680
I would advise you to head north.

322
01:17:07,047 --> 01:17:08,321
Thank you very much.

323
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:20,955
You can go now.

324
01:17:27,247 --> 01:17:28,043
Mummy...

325
01:20:41,487 --> 01:20:44,081
We can't go much further.

326
01:21:05,047 --> 01:21:09,245
We'll go on to our next stop together.
It's better for both of us.

327
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:12,078
Then you can go your own way.

328
01:21:45,807 --> 01:21:46,717
It's me, Alberto!

329
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:47,717
Don't shoot.

330
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:49,925
Don't shoot! It's the shepherd.

331
01:21:54,047 --> 01:21:54,763
Alberto...

332
01:21:58,367 --> 01:21:59,641
So how's it going?

333
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:13,482
Who's this?

334
01:22:13,567 --> 01:22:15,000
This is Américo.

335
01:22:16,367 --> 01:22:19,567
He's a friend I made in prison.
I brought him along with me.

336
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:20,477
In prison?

337
01:22:21,047 --> 01:22:22,480
It's a long story.

338
01:22:23,927 --> 01:22:27,761
He wants to go with the flow.
But I've got to get out of here.

339
01:22:28,287 --> 01:22:29,402
Where are you going?

340
01:22:32,167 --> 01:22:33,964
He says he's going south.

341
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:36,004
But I'm heading up to the mountains.

342
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:47,042
Américo...

343
01:22:49,727 --> 01:22:51,001
safe journey.

344
01:23:23,247 --> 01:23:24,600
Have a good trip!

345
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:39,397
Alberto!

346
01:25:40,607 --> 01:25:41,881
How did you get in?

347
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:45,167
That doesn't matter.
What about José Fernandes?

348
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:47,967
They're out looking for you.
Everyone is after you.

349
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:49,527
I came to fetch you.

350
01:25:49,527 --> 01:25:52,405
Let's get out of here with the boy.

351
01:25:52,767 --> 01:25:53,961
And go where?

352
01:25:54,247 --> 01:25:57,080
Am I to wander the
mountains with a runaway?

353
01:25:57,447 --> 01:25:59,358
Things will never improve here.

354
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:02,159
Let's go, Noémia.

355
01:26:03,407 --> 01:26:04,601
I can't.

356
01:26:05,407 --> 01:26:07,602
This is where I belong.

357
01:26:08,807 --> 01:26:12,163
As little as I like it,
this is the place God chose for me.

358
01:26:12,927 --> 01:26:15,282
You'd rather stay here?

359
01:26:51,047 --> 01:26:52,002
Hello!

360
01:26:54,927 --> 01:26:56,485
Is anybody there?

361
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,520
Have you seen the shepherd?

362
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:57,117
My dear fellow,
I hereby claim my right to another duel.

363
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:03,327
I'm sorry.
But I will not use this weapon again.

364
01:30:03,327 --> 01:30:06,205
You shall not deny me my right!
