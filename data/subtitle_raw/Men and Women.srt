Public Toilet Time, Public Toilet Time.

00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,229
Hello, my dear friends,
Happy New Year.

3
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,697
This is the International
Red Star radio station.

4
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,300
Being the only radio station about
toilet literature on earth,

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,839
we've received so much support and encouragement
from you since our opening day.

6
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:24,316
My name is Gui Gui,
host of this program.

7
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,245
At this great New Year's day, 1999,

8
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,423
on behalf of our entire crew,

9
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,052
I'd like to wish you smooth defecation

10
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:38,721
and a long flowing piss in the New Year.

11
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,164
The following is a personal ad...

12
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,827
for someone seeking a lavatory partner:

13
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:50,473

14
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:54,011
yet gentle, very well-hung,

15
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,248
is seeking a young,
good looking male partner

16
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,749
taller than 180 cm

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,581
Foreigners preferred.

18
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,923
Please call: 8610-65313789

19
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,721
ext. 66333

20
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,785
OK, this one's fine,

21
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,097
but it's European size
which is bigger than normal.

22
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,563
Please feel free to look around.

23
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:03,103
- How much is this?
- 300 yuan.

24
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,611
- Is it for export?
- Yeah. They all are for export.

25
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,801
How about 150 yuan?

26
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,479
150? Too cheap. This one's OK.

27
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,345
I'll check somewhere else.

28
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,349
Is this pure wool?

29
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,851
Come back any time.

30
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,487
- Is this pure wool?
- Oh, yeah.

31
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,921
- How much is this?
- 230 yuan.

32
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,925
230 yuan? It fits you well.

33
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,723
The color looks good.

34
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,903
How much is this, your lowest price?

35
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,567
230 yuan is already very low.

36
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,241
How about 190?
Xiao Li, does it look good on me?

37
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,272
- Pretty good.
- Then I'll take it.

38
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,314
Please feel free to look around.

39
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,849
Madam, is Mr. Li in?

40
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,818
Mr. Li? There's no Mr. Li here.

41
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,992
He is the man who owns this store.

42
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,461
The man who owns this store.

43
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,889
There's no such person here.

44
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,821
200's my best offer.
What do you think?

45
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,564
- Is this pure wool?
- Yes, it is.

46
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,294
Well, please wrap it up for me then.

47
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,366
You can look for something else.

48
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,835
It's impossible.

49
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,803
Someone at my village told me he
should be here.

50
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,681
It should be here

51
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,502
We are only workers,
and don't have much money.

52
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,407
No way, look at your fashionable clothes.

53
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,539
It's cheap, only 400 yuan for this one.

54
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,008
Can't go any lower.

55
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,440
I'll keep looking around then.

56
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,281
Madam, may I use the phone?

57
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,575
Sure, go ahead.

58
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,649
- Wrap it up please.
- So, you want this one.

59
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,252
Why not find something else?

60
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,519
Please page: paging 8870,
last name Yu, 64244230.

61
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,954
They're all OK.

62
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,326
That one's alright, but too expensive.

63
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,863
I suggest you buy it. You won't
find it this cheap anywhere else

64
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,803
- Too expensive.
- No, it's only 400 yuan.

65
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,341
How about 190? It's all I've got.

66
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,776
200, 200 yuan.

67
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,439
Can't you cut the price a little more?

68
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,384
Take a look at the pants.

69
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,625
- I've only got 180 yuan.
- 180, OK?

70
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,454
We're going to come back often.

71
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:38,997
You're getting a real bargain.
I'm losing my money this time.

72
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,396
- Come back again.
- OK. Bye.

73
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,438
- Hasn't he called back?
- No.

74
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,953
What do you want this Mr. Li for?

75
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:11,163
A friend introduced me to work for him.

76
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,326
- You're looking for a job?
- Yes.

77
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,480
You can work for me here then.

78
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,145
- You think I'm qualified?
- Why not?

79
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,149
Try it first to see if you like it.

80
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,582
OK.

81
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,630
How do you sell these clothes?

82
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,891
I'll show you later.

83
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,262
First tidy up those pants.

84
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,092
Xiao Bo, Xiao Bo, come over.

85
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,899
Hey, Xiao Bo, let me handle it.

86
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,076
I'll do it, I'll do it.

87
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,920
If you don't need me,
I've got to go to work. Bye

88
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,254
Bye.

89
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,110
- Xiao Bo, change your shoes.
- Oh, I'll do it.

90
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,424
Towel, towel...

91
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,926
Xiao Bo, use this towel.

92
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,027
I'll hang it here for you.

93
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,701
Here's some shampoo.

94
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,810
Use this oil after your shower.

95
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,284
Turn on the water like this.

96
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,422
Turn it off when you're done.

97
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,887
- Afterwards you can put this on.
- Oh.

98
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,193
See if the water's OK.

99
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,889
If not, you can adjust it.

100
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,569
Check if the water's OK.

101
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:13,856
Xiao Bo, is the water OK?

102
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,593
Not too cold?

103
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,202
It's fine.

104
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,138
Dinner's ready.

105
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,638
- Let's start
- Would you like something to drink?

106
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,478
Want some?

107
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:36,906
Either way I'm OK.

108
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,050
- Have some beer.
- Alright.

109
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,343
I'll go get a glass for you.

110
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,221
- Here you are.
- Thank you!

111
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,433
Want some?

112
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,540
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

113
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,578
- Help yourself.
- Okay.

114
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,849
- You like spicy food?
- It's fine.

115
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,288
The food is good.

116
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,634
Have some more.

117
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,539
Hey Xiao Bo,
do you have a girlfriend?

118
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,546
I'm still young.

119
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,344
Let your new boss
introduce one to you someday.

120
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:58,221
The pork's not too salty?
Have some more.

121
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,591
I'll get you more rice.

122
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,631
- I'll help myself.
- Let me.

123
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,504
Get me another bowl too.

124
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:14,677
Eat!

125
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,088
Ah. Thank you!

126
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,426
Eat it up, it'll get cold

127
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,713
- Mrs. Qing, let me do it.
- I'll do it.

128
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,933
- Pass me your bag
- Okay.

129
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,733
and I'll get your stuff organized.

130
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:27,986
Is the quilt OK?

131
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,451
It shouldn't be any thicker.

132
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,048
Because the heating is good here,
you may want to kick if off at night.

133
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,223
I'm fine here, Mrs. Qing.

134
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,859
Sure, I'm boiling some water.

135
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,619
Put your bag here,
and let's see how to arrange your things.

136
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,196
The room is a little too small.

137
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,624
I think it would be OK
for Xiao Bo to live in the store.

138
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,771
It's hard to find a good boy like Xiao Bo.

139
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,599
- I'm turning off the light.
- Wait a minute.

140
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,371
Don't bother me, OK?

141
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,764
- Ah, I scored!
- It didn't go in.

142
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,033
Mrs. Qing, someone's playing football.

143
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,375
Good kick

144
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,057
Nice

145
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,662
Come on

146
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,109
Well done!

147
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,204
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

148
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,743
Come back. Anytime.

149
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,185
Hello, Mr. Kang, Mrs. Qing's not here.

150
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,852
She went to Da Yang's
to chase down a debt.

151
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,099
Oh.

152
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,114
Hey, what's the matter?
Why are you crying?

153
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,292
What's the matter?

154
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,421
What's wrong?

155
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,266
Come on, have some water.

156
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,536
Have some water.

157
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,601
What's going on?
You've got to speak to me.

158
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:55,740
Who bullied you? Tell me!

159
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,684
Who's giving you trouble?

160
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,913
Tell me who's hurting you!

161
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,983
Da Yang is trying to get away
without paying the money.

162
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,825
It's that bastard again.
Let's find him and square this account.

163
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:20,733
Come on, let's go get him! Go!

164
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,987
Xiao Bo, come with me!

165
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,591
Sorry, we're closing

166
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,682
What's going on?

167
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,048
Get into the car first.

168
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,358
- Who is it?
- Is Da Yang there?

169
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,500
- Speak, who is it?
- Da Yang

170
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,795
- Who?
- Da Yang

171
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,099
Fuck you, fuck you!

172
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:34,875
Oh this hurts

173
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,173
Fuck you!

174
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,407
You fucking pull that shit on my wife?

175
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,243
Cheating women!
Who the fuck do you think you are?!?

176
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,653
I'll give you the money, OK?

177
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,617
I'll give you money!

178
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,017
Give it to me!

179
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,554
Give me the money!

180
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,191
Hurry up!

181
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,529
- I haven't counted it yet.
- Give it!

182
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,931
- I've already given you the money
- Give it!

183
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,899
- I haven't counted it
- No need to count

184
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,702
If you move, I'll beat you up

185
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,336
Let's go. Don't move

186
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:16,315
Let's go

187
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:33,289
Xiao Bo, I'll introduce you
to a friend of mine tonight.

188
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,464
Who is it?

189
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,995
Don't ask.

190
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,343
Mrs. Qing,
because it's not very busy here,

191
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,885
I want to find more work
to fill out my schedule.

192
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,886
Sure.

193
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,916
- That day I found you in the store...
- Boxing.

194
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,787
Who taught you that?

195
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,657
I studied it when I was little.

196
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,426
That's interesting.

197
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,739
Mrs. Qing, I'm coming.

198
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,903
You're late you know.

199
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,135
Sorry, I was stuck in traffic
for half an hour.

200
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,210
Do you like my hair?

201
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,110
What a shame you cut it.

202
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,048
You don't like it?

203
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,813
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning to cut it!

204
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,115
Just tell me if it looks nice!

205
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,416
Very nice, very nice.

206
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,320
Why don't you cut yours too?

207
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,688
No, it wouldn't look good on me.

208
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,329
Will you do it?

209
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,493
Hey! What're you doing, a wig!

210
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,292
- I bet you didn't recognize it
- No I didn't

211
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,570
- Why don't you try it
- No, I don't like it

212
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,438
Xiao Bo, my little brother.

213
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,369
Ah Meng, my little sister.
Hello

214
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,508
How are you

215
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:24,941
Looks good

216
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,372
Let's go to Tianjin in a couple of days
and enjoy ourselves.

217
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:27,739
Sure, I'd love to go.

218
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,346
Good, I'll be free in two days,
and can go with you.

219
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:30,482
Really!

220
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,251
I've already ordered,

221
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,080
all your favorites.

222
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,048
Thanks!

223
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,759
Try it on later,
it will look good on you.

224
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,692
I don't like wigs

225
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,560
Doesn't it press down on your hair?

226
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,561
I would never have guessed it was a wig

227
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:55,263
I bought it this morning.
It's just for fun

228
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,369
- It's quite good, isn't it?
- Yes.

229
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,011
Let's eat

230
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,820
Get another pair of chopsticks.

231
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,323
I'll give you mine for now

232
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,960
You go ahead

233
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,018
Please start. Are you hungry?

234
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,560
I still think long hair suits you.

235
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,429
It's okay, it's pretty

236
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,231
Eat, Xiao Bo!

237
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,616
Mrs. Qing, I've got to go back now.

238
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,656
- You want to go back?
- Yes.

239
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,492
Alright then, you can go.

240
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,792
- Bye.
- Bye.

241
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,302
What do you think of Xiao Bo?

242
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,500
He is fine, pretty nice.

243
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,098
Do you like him?

244
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,176
We only met once.

245
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,107
You know,

246
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,076
I'm just not the sensitive type.

247
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,374
You guys can keep going out.

248
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,777
Let's go.

249
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,289
Mr. Kang.

250
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,397
You're back, where've you been?

251
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,227
Mrs. Qing introduced a girl to me.

252
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,800
Really?

253
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,809
How did it go?

254
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,511
I just met her tonight,
it's hard to say.

255
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,286
Don't worry, take your time.

256
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,821
Is she good looking?

257
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:56,786
Not bad.

258
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,425
What does she do?

259
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,160
I didn't ask.

260
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,267
If you've got a little time,
let's go shoot some pool.

261
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,637
- Sure.
- I'll turn off the TV, then.

262
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,729
- Got it.
- It's in.

263
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,937
You're cleaning up.

264
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,492
You've won every game tonight.

265
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,757
Let's go for one more.

266
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,267
We'd better go now, otherwise
Mrs. Qing will get angry.

267
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,630
No problem.
You shoot a mean game of pool.

268
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,394
Oh, I was just lucky.

269
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,106
I've gotta stop by the toilet.

270
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,866
Wait, I'll go too.

271
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,886
I should've shot high on
the ninth ball.

272
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:37,986
Yeah.

273
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,927
Actually, shooting low

274
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,033
would've been a little better.

275
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,538
We'll do it again sometime.

276
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,853
Hey, look, the river hasn't frozen yet.

277
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,392
Are there any fish in it?

278
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,532
Hey, Xiao Bo...

279
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,601
Why did you wait so late
to have your teeth straightened?

280
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,999
A friend of mine told me to do it.

281
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,268
Does it hurt? It must be very painful.

282
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,569
Hmm, not really.

283
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,812
I have a friend who is a dentist.

284
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,009
How about I take you to see her?

285
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,319
She's got some kind of
porcelain braces

286
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,581
which I think look very good.

287
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:02,090
Lots of kids are using them.

288
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,487
It's too much trouble.

289
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,984
No trouble

290
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,727
That's right

291
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,835
Which female star do you like?

292
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,330
No one.

293
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,205
You don't even like Gong Li?

294
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:19,903
Not really.

295
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,203
Gong Li's the most
beautiful woman in Asia.

296
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,376
Hey,

297
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,819
let's go to a movie...

298
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,062
The chili's too hot.

299
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,040
I've got a feeling something isn't right.

300
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,679
What's wrong?

301
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,308
Thank you.

302
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,377
What's wrong?

303
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,953
I realize that Xiao Bo
doesn't like me at all.

304
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:11,858
He doesn't like you?
Impossible.

305
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,295
I don't think he has
any interest in me whatsoever.

306
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,200
And, to be honest,

307
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,359
I don't think he even likes girls.

308
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,665
He doesn't like girls?

309
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,605
I also think it's strange,

310
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,678
but I just feel a little awkward with him.

311
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,542
I've never suspected
he doesn't like girls.

312
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,575
You haven't?

313
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:38,278
It can't be true.
He must like girls.

314
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,291
Where did you get this feeling?

315
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,687
It's hard to explain,
but I can just feel it from him.

316
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:57,264
Doesn't like girls, very strange.

317
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,147
It is.
Tell me how could he be like this.

318
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,027
Feel free to look around.

319
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,302
Miss, how much is this?

320
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,307
198 yuan, 20% off.

321
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,331
Alright.

322
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,945
- What do you think about it?
- It's OK.

323
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,391
Mrs. Qing, is it OK to put these here

324
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:28,955
Yes.

325
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,158
What do we do about Xiao Bo?

326
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,590
What do you mean?

327
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,562
He doesn't like girls,

328
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:46,508
even a lovely girl like Meng.

329
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:01,350
It's going to be very tough
for him being like this.

330
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,993
Don't be silly, go to sleep.

331
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,628
It's going to be real tough.

332
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,437
Stop it, go to sleep.

333
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,428
This is my card.

334
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,300
What's this?

335
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,496
I am the editor in chief
of Brilliant WC.

336
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,509
What's that?

337
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,046
I am the editor in chief
of the magazine.

338
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,184
Thanks.

339
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,627
Chong Chong,
the senior writer of Brilliant WC.

340
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:23,631
Brilliant WC?
Is it really called like this?

341
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,736
Editor in chief? Interesting.

342
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:35,778
A thief, holding two balls,
looks around a vast grassland...

343
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:29,655
Hello, good, good, good,

344
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,267
I'll call you back later.

345
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,197
Just had your hair slicked?

346
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,634
Yeah, yesterday.

347
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,034
It costed 150 yuan.

348
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,436
So expensive.

349
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,437
What are you going to do
for the Chinese New Year?

350
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:46,873
Beijing's no fun.

351
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:50,282
Let's go somewhere else.

352
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:51,815
Where?

353
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,556
Take a trip just like foreigners.

354
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,817
Let's go on a trip

355
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,023
Travelling's OK but...

356
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,563
Like Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, or Europe?

357
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,256
Europe would be good,

358
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,231
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore
are not interesting though.

359
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,632
Let's go to...

360
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,173
Let's go to Vietnam,

361
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,811
Egypt, or Nepal.

362
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:15,968
What do you think?

363
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:17,836
Great.

364
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,382
Then that's it.
We'd better choose a place first.

365
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,318
It's a deal then.
We'll go together.

366
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,314
I promise, okay.

367
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,513
Your little finger?

368
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,154
What little finger?
I'm not making deals

369
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:14,066
Hello, you're Gui Gui, right?

370
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,303
Wow! Is that really you?

371
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,507
I'm a big fan of yours

372
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:21,668
and love your program so much!

373
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,743
Your program has really enriched

374
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,543
all our lives with color and hope.

375
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:32,116
But I have a suggestion.

376
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:39,289
Yes, yes, your suggestion is pretty good.

377
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:41,687
Right, right.

378
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:43,663
We definitely need improvement,

379
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:47,395
making our programs better

380
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,903
by giving you more
spiritual food, right?

381
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,273
What? My voice is sweet?

382
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:02,284
Of course.
My looks are even sweeter.

383
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:08,722
You want a date?
There will be many opportunities.

384
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,163
Alright. Sorry, let's talk later,

385
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,597
there's a call coming in.

386
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:23,403
Thanks, thanks for your support. Bye.

387
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,461
- Hey, you're here!
- How are you?

388
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,060
- Anything else?
- This is fine.

389
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:51,799
Miss? A coke please.

390
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:04,709
Thanks.

391
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:10,049
Our first edition of Brilliant WC

392
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,255
has been published.

393
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:16,321
Your front page design looks great.

394
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,727
This publication is the only one in China.

395
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,393
You're flattering me.

396
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,534
It's very fashionable.

397
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:29,730
Hey, here's your article,

398
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,135
"Sixteen year old creamy body,
the true seduction. "

399
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,401
Really? My articles? Let me see.

400
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,337
Wow! It's really here.

401
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:39,446
Pretty good, isn't it?

402
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:41,278
It's got my name on it.

403
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,052
Of course.

404
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,851
Wow, you've got toilet cartoons here.

405
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:46,818
Don't they look good?

406
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:49,186
Very interesting.

407
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,690
Oh, this is the toilet literature
I've found for you.

408
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:02,164
Two pieces, one for 50 yuan, two for 100.

409
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,607
But, two are not enough.

410
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,042
You're too picky.

411
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,580
You know that girls
are more reserved than guys.

412
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,306
You'd rarely see girls
in a public toilet drawing graffiti.

413
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:18,479
Look at these two,
you know they were very hard to come by.

414
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:19,918
I am serious!

415
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:27,097
Wow! There are so many categories!

416
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:32,231
Yeah, all these were written by a woman?

417
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:39,601
Yeah, you have to identify them.

418
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:43,907
I think some guy probably
ran into the girls' toilet and wrote it.

419
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,043
The first one is saying
little Li is a small demon.

420
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,582
It doesn't look like a woman's
handwriting.

421
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,645
The second one is saying
God has made a celestial's cave,

422
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,848
but the infinite scene
is a perilous peak.

423
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,253
They've got to be written by men.

424
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,987
It's hard to tell,
but they can all be used anyway.

425
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,221
Really?

426
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,098
Your magazine is very good.

427
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:09,236
I see there are also
public toilet sayings and fables.

428
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:10,600
I'll write more stuff
for you later,

429
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:12,600
I appreciate your effort.

430
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,971
I love doing it.

431
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,337
Not just graffiti

432
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,416
If you and your girlfriends

433
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,075
have anything to say about toilets,

434
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,219
please contribute it
to our magazine.

435
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,321
Actually,

436
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,720
I do have some friends

437
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,449
who can help you out.

438
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:49,772
Mrs. Qing.

439
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:51,380
I'm done, it's your turn.

440
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:05,027
Xiao Bo,
this is your salary for this month,

441
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,219
I'll put it on your bed.

442
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,625
OK.

443
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,772
Did you call the doctor yesterday?

444
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:22,970
Yes.

445
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:37,983
Don't forget to go to the dentist

446
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:39,288
and get your cap fixed.

447
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,361
OK.

448
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,629
Mrs. Qing, aren't we expecting
any more goods today?

449
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,398
Why? We don't even have time
to get rid of our current stock.

450
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,574
Come back to the store
after seeing the dentist.

451
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:56,644
OK.

452
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,704
I'm leaving

453
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,496
How many have you done?

454
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:55,162
23, 24, twenty four...

455
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:10,813
I'm too hot.

456
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:59,432
I'm so weak, I've only done 51.

457
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:24,817
What are you doing?
Mr Kang, what are you doing?

458
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,259
Mr. Kang! Stop it!

459
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,544
Who the fuck do you think you are?

460
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,051
A rabbit, a glass boy
with a cock and a cunt.

461
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,985
You didn't think I knew it, right?

462
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:55,180
I'm telling you,

463
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,054
I just want to try something new.

464
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,218
I don't give a shit about you,

465
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,523
I don't even fucking want you for free.

466
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:04,791
You stink, looking like a man.

467
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,299
Who knows what prick

468
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,028
you've got hiding in your ass!

469
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,209
If I were you I'd rather fucking die!

470
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,143
You think you're such hot stuff

471
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,047
You're a disgrace to men!

472
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,789
You say that again, I'll kill you!

473
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:38,465
Wait! Give me back the coat
my wife gave you.

474
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:40,995
Get out!

475
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,512
Fuck... fuck.

476
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:19,233
Goodbye

477
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:31,812
- Come in, Xiao Bo.
- Mrs. Qing, I want to leave.

478
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:36,413
- What's the problem?
- Nothing, I just want to go.

479
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,152
- Anything happened at your home?
- Yeah.

480
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,984
Mrs. Qing,
what's the lowest price for this one?

481
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:46,490
No less than 120.

482
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,624
- You'd better go get the train ticket now
- Sure

483
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:52,734
- They'll be sold out if you are late.
- Yeah.

484
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:56,503
- Why don't you put any clothes on?.. Here.
- No.

485
00:57:57,007 --> 00:58:03,435
Put some clothes on. Hurry up, do it!

486
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,241
Put this jacket on

487
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,641
Why aren't you putting them on?

488
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,519
Hurry up and buy the ticket.

489
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:15,648
- Take this money with you.
- I don't need it.

490
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:19,452
It's urgent. Hurry up!

491
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,893
Mrs. Qing, I'm going.

492
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,168
Xiao Bo, don't buy it
from the people in the street.

493
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,735
They sell fake tickets all the time.

494
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:29,064
Remember.

495
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,708
- Give me a call when you get home.
- I will.

496
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,816
Hey, Mr. Chong, it's me, Xiao Bo.

497
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,122
I've quit my job,

498
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:39,797
and I need to stay at your place.

499
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:45,798
OK, thanks, Mr. Chong,
I'll be there soon.

500
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:48,401
Bye.

501
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,580
Take this money

502
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:07,052
- Coming. Who is it?
- It's me.

503
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,729
You really quit, didn't you?

504
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:23,010
I heard your "sister"
treated you pretty well.

505
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,311
She treated me very nice

506
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,077
It's true, but I had some other trouble.

507
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,319
- What other trouble?
- Forget about it.

508
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:32,714
If you want to quit, just quit.

509
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,414
The folding bed is still there.

510
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:38,060
- You can sleep in the living room.
- OK.

511
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:40,492
Have a seat.
I've got to finish this up.

512
01:01:40,664 --> 01:01:41,562
OK.

513
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,729
We'll go to dinner together later.

514
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,633
There's water there, help yourself

515
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,864
I know

516
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,871
Sure, Mr. Chong,
I'll get you a glass of water.

517
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,642
I'll do it.

518
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:07,684
- Chong Chong, who's this?
- A friend of mine.

519
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:18,831
Cool. I've met you before.

520
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,495
Is there anyone you haven't met?

521
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,065
How come you live here?

522
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,670
Oh, he's been living here
for over a month.

523
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:42,787
Xiao Bo,
he's a good friend of mine, Gui Gui.

524
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:45,223
Have a seat Gui Gui.

525
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:53,263
Have a drink.

526
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,508
What could happen
with Xiao Bo's family?

527
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,842
He didn't even put a coat on
when he left!

528
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,415
How would I know?
He's your "little brother".

529
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:14,147
Is there anything you can tell me?

530
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,064
I've got something to tell you.

531
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,529
Our stock is almost sold out.

532
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:58,190
I suppose I could
close the store tomorrow.

533
01:03:58,601 --> 01:03:59,727
Why so quick?

534
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,862
- Xiao Bo.
- Yeah.

535
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,471
- Are you up?
- Yeah, I'm up.

536
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,799
Xiao Bo, be careful on your trip.

537
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,036
Yeah.

538
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:43,401
I'm telling you take this bus.

539
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,242
Adjust your collar.

540
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:54,548
- Remember to change to No. 302,
and you'll get there. - Yeah.

541
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,400
- Let's check the fabric store.
- OK.

542
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:57,905
What's wrong?

543
01:06:58,281 --> 01:06:59,111
Nothing

544
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:41,756
- Mr. Chong.
- Hey you're back.

545
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:47,724
What have you got?

546
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,166
Public toilet fables.

547
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,236
- How many?
- I've given out 13 copies.

548
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:08,008
- Good, good. It's pretty cold...
- Yeah.

549
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:12,513
- How's our distribution going?
- Thirteen copies.

550
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,822
That's not enough.

551
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:20,587
Some bar owners didn't want them.

552
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,697
They said they are kind of...

553
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,899
Vulgar. Is that what they meant?

554
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,035
Come here and have some water.

555
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,150
Have some water.

556
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,050
- Wow, your hands are cold.
- Yeah.

557
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:52,090
Hi, Chong Chong.
I'm waiting for you.

558
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,626
I don't want to cook tonight.

559
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,692
What do you want to have?

560
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,264
It's up to you.

561
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,369
You tell me. What do you want to eat?

562
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:03,464
McDonald's.

563
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,129
McDonald's.

564
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,974
Well. Let it be McDonald's then.

565
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,940
He must have got a bonus
taking us to McDonald's.

566
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:11,637
Yeah, I got a bonus.

567
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:12,872
Ah.

568
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:14,778
Let's go.

569
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,782
Just a second. I want some water.

570
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:18,921
I have to wash my hands too,

571
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:21,579
because I've been so busy in the kitchen.

572
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:26,827
Good. First, dance like this.

573
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,397
This leg first. Remember,
lift the tip of your foot a little.

574
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:33,034
And don't forget, move to the centre first.

575
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,760
OK. Let's start.

576
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:39,673
1,2,3. 2,2,3. 3,2,3. Relax.

577
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,107
4,2,3. You're too sluggish.

578
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,337
What are you doing? So romantic!

579
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:20,505
There's so much damn work to do.
Aren't you still the chief editor?

580
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:26,219
Get to work, get to work!
Move the table over here.

581
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,346
The magazine.

582
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,659
The only thing you care about is dancing.

583
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:22,277
I have something to tell you.

584
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:23,878
What?

585
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,755
I want to move out.

586
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,297
What do you mean?

587
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:44,435
Nothing.
I mean I won't live here anymore.

588
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,040
The apartment's yours.

589
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:52,842
You want a divorce?

590
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:57,549
It's up to you.

591
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,354
Why?

592
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,494
Because someone else likes me.

593
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:18,167
- Are you having an affair?
- Yes.

594
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:22,704
For how long?

595
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:25,878
Not too long.

596
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,446
Who is it?

597
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,614
Don't ask.

598
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,558
You're not walking out this door
until you tell me.

599
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,001
- Don't be surprised if I tell you.
- I won't.

600
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:10,653
It's Meng.

601
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,229
Who? A-Meng?

602
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:39,878
Meng, it's me.
It's all settled here.

603
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:45,290
Come and pick me up.

604
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:52,261
If Xiao Bo calls,

605
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,561
tell him to page me or call my mobile.

606
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,651
Please wait a little longer.

607
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,290
She'll be right down.

608
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:22,487
Let me.

609
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,968
OK, we can go.

610
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,308
What's up?

611
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:43,882
What's the matter?

612
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,111
Sorry, I can't start the car.

613
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:46,584
Can you give me a hand?

614
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,017
Sure.

615
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,093
- Should we push?
- Yeah, push.

616
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:03,431
- Alright?
- Get into the car.

617
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,739
Let's go.

618
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:45,442
Let's play together

619
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,706
Sure

620
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,858
We'll play together

621
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,627
You three form a team
and the three of us another team

622
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:01,987
Sure

623
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:04,457
Let's start

624
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,525
Come on

625
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:14,434
We'll play a 10 point game

626
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:32,247
Public Toilet Time.
Public Toilet Time.

627
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:35,318
Dear friends,

628
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,920
This is the International
Red Star radio station.

629
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:43,394
I'm the host, Gui Gui,

630
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,033
saying hello to everybody
from the nation's Capital, Beijing.

631
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,134
As the weather is heating up,

632
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:52,465
the political atmosphere
is constantly changing.

633
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:55,303
Dangerous elements keep surfacing.

634
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:59,002
Inflation is getting worse and worse.

635
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:05,447
All our crew members
have incurable diseases.

636
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,212
And we are dying.

637
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:13,393
So, on behalf of all of them,

638
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:17,496
with tears in my eyes,
I would like to say goodbye to you all.

639
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:22,661
We have created a special program for you.

640
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,931
First, we'll turn to the news.

641
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:29,434
Then, we will broadcast a radio play,

642
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:33,206
"Naked Politics",

643
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:36,373
written by our famous toilet writer,
Chong Chong.

644
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,216
Next, I would like to tell you a fable

645
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:40,786
about public toilets.

646
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:45,492
One day,
the Emperor was chairing a meeting.

647
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,026
Suddenly, he had a pain in his stomach,
and desperately needed to piss.

648
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:50,164
After the emperor left the public toilet,

649
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:51,799
two blind men started arguing.

650
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:53,525
Then, one of them touched
the front of the emperor said:

651
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:56,262
"The emperor is nothing

652
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,804
but a mass of soft meat. "

653
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:01,067
Then, the other one touched
the emperor's back and said:

654
01:28:01,243 --> 01:28:05,304
"No, the power of the emperor
comes from a hole. "

655
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,446
Next, I will broadcast

656
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,744
a public toilet riddle.

657
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:14,521
Beans are boiled
by burning bean stalks.

658
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,782
They cry in the stomach.

659
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,926
If they come from the same plant,

660
01:28:19,094 --> 01:28:21,619
why are the ones burning the others?

661
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,731
The answer is an activity
in a public toilet.

662
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,166
Dear friends,

663
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:27,824
each one of us can only live one life,

664
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:30,665
but love exists in many ways.

665
01:28:31,373 --> 01:28:34,171
Public toilet life is so wonderful,

666
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:37,239
but love can end in a tragedy.

667
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,845
In order to find love,

668
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:44,315
as the host of Public Toilet Time,

669
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,681
I'd like to say goodbye to everybody,

670
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:50,018
and am going to Uranus to experience
a new kind of public toilet life.

671
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:53,060
Someday, you will hear from me

672
01:28:53,228 --> 01:28:56,322
in Uranus with a brand new program.

673
01:28:57,299 --> 01:29:00,632
I wish all of you good health,
and a great future,

674
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:07,332
in a conjugal bliss in a toilet,
until a ripe old age.
