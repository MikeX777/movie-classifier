1
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,523
Hear anything?

2
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,791
Nope.

3
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,362
Bev?

4
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,164
Nope.

5
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,100
This thing's stupid.

6
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,202
You know what isn't stupid?

7
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,604
Your birthday present.

8
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,075
What is it?

9
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,643
Just open it.

10
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,283
I can't believe you stole
this from your dad's office.

11
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,719
Let's try it.

12
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,724
Is this Jewish?

13
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,392
You mean Hebrew?

14
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,727
Right, Yossi?

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,462
Yeah, but it's not Hebrew.

16
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,098
I think it's Chinese.

17
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,399
How does this thing work?

18
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,168
Well, it's a spirit board.

19
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,803
You're supposed to contact
people or ask it questions.

20
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,140
Like dead people?

21
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,808
Or is Bev going to kiss you?

22
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,777
Shut up, Max.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,711
What?

24
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm just stating the obvious.

25
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,416
I think just dead people.

26
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,419
Ask it a question already.

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,258
Did my mom and dad get me
the BMX bike that I wanted?

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,177
Does Beverly Morgan like Yossi?

29
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,317
This thing is also stupid.

30
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,485
Maybe because
you're not asking it

31
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,387
The right questions.

32
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,323
Hey, Bev.

33
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,857
Your parents are here.

34
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,626
- Oh, okay.
- And you two?

35
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,195
It's time to get to sleep.

36
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,196
Alright, I promised
your dad that you

37
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,497
Would be in bed
before nine, pal.

38
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,431
Alright boys?

39
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,332
Okay, Dad.

40
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,266
Okay, Mr. T.

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,834
Alrighty.

42
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,671
You know, I
think Max asked one

43
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,507
Right question on the board?

44
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,176
Which one?

45
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,580
Gross!

46
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,617
You going to miss me?

47
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,552
Always.

48
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,425
Okay, Romeo,
let's get to bed.

49
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,456
Quit it, Max.

50
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,648
Max, is that you?

51
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,437
Hello?

52
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,307
Hello?

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,374
Aba?

54
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:03,311
Yossi! Are you
okay? What happened?

55
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:06,380
It's Max, something's wrong.

56
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,383
Yosef.

57
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,453
I took the Ouija board
and let Max play with it and

58
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,554
What Ouija board?

59
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,389
The one from my office?

60
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,458
Yes, I'm sorry, I...

61
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,360
It's out.

62
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:23,297
Yosef, you find a
place to hide at Max's

63
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,366
And you don't come
out 'til I get you!

64
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,869
Yosef! Yosef!

65
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,458
Show yourself demon!

66
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,423
Yousef?

67
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,516
Mark?

68
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,621
Aba?

69
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,563
Yousef, run!

70
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,106
Hello?

71
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,711
Oh.

72
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,513
Yeah.

73
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:37,184
Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

74
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,753
Bye.

75
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,166
I'm so glad I finally
get to meet my grandfather

76
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,702
For the first time,

77
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:57,270
Right before he's about to die.

78
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,073
Yeah, I guess I deserve that.

79
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,709
You think?

80
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:06,313
Look, you want to blame Dov
for keeping us apart, not me.

81
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,649
Why do you always
call him that?

82
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,583
Because that's his name.

83
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:10,718
I know, but he's your father.

84
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,020
Was my father.

85
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,623
I haven't seen that
man in over 30 years.

86
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,661
I'm having a hard
time figuring out

87
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,095
Why he would put
you in a foster home

88
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,631
For no reason.

89
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,732
Because your grandfather is an

90
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,366
Extremely selfish man.

91
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,669
Just sucks is all.

92
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:29,637
Especially considering
you can't remember

93
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,240
Your childhood because
of some stupid accident.

94
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,275
Yeah.

95
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,745
It does suck.

96
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,280
But I had no control over that.

97
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:41,749
But you know the
one thing I do have

98
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,685
Control over is
being your father.

99
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,119
And just so you
know, I would never

100
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,923
Ever do what Dov
did to me to you.

101
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,693
I care about you way too much.

102
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,263
I care about you too, Dad.

103
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,738
Come on, Dad.

104
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,722
He's stable now.

105
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,391
But we're not sure
how much time he has.

106
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,061
Does he know we're here?

107
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,430
No. I did has you asked.

108
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,333
I didn't tell him
you were coming.

109
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,770
Thank you.

110
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,205
I'll leave you to it then.

111
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,876
You okay?

112
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,268
Grandpa?

113
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,740
You're a handsome young man.

114
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,743
What's your name?

115
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,413
Noah.

116
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,482
I'm your grandson.

117
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,318
I don't have a grandson.

118
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,321
Yes. Yes you do.

119
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,197
Yousef you're...

120
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,536
You're not supposed
to be in this house.

121
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,240
It's too dangerous.

122
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,276
I think after 30 years I
actually deserve an explanation.

123
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,946
What is so dangerous
about an old house?

124
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:03,984
It's not the house,
it's what's in it.

125
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,958
Noah, leave the room.

126
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,826
- Dad
- No, go.

127
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,270
I did what I had
to do to protect you.

128
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,138
Protect me?

129
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:28,876
You self-righteous piece
of crap, protect me?

130
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,879
I spent 10 years getting my
ass kicked in foster homes

131
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,848
Where was your protection then?

132
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,485
It was for your own good.

133
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:44,958
Now, please leave.

134
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:49,396
Before it's too late.

135
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,602
I know you're not an
observant man anymore.

136
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:02,242
But promise me you will
never lose your faith,

137
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,411
Especially in me.

138
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,380
That's easy.

139
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,450
I never had it to begin with.

140
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,219
Games on in 15,
babe, in and out.

141
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,926
Geez, what's their problem?

142
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,262
You'd think somebody died.

143
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,936
Please behave yourself, Jeff.

144
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,437
What's in it for me?

145
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,239
What do you mean?

146
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,542
We haven't done it in forever.

147
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,079
I wonder why that is.

148
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,551
Oh wow, Beverly Morgan.

149
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,320
You look amazing.

150
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,990
You don't look
half bad yourself.

151
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,128
I am so sorry for
your loss, Yossi.

152
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,396
Thank you,

153
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,631
And it's Joe now.

154
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,435
Joe. Okay.

155
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,509
Hi, Noah Barnett,
at your service.

156
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,978
Chloe.

157
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,647
I'm sorry for your loss.

158
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,085
You must have made this.

159
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,253
Why?

160
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,455
Because it smells heavenly

161
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,991
Can I go now?

162
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,161
I have some flowers for ya.

163
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,063
Uh,

164
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,364
Sorry about your dad, man.

165
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,533
He was a weird old dude.

166
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,137
Yeah. Yeah I should
probably get rid of these.

167
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,505
I just paid 35.99 for those.

168
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,374
You just going to chuck them?

169
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,210
No, in the Jewish tradition
we don't believe in flowers

170
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,412
For mourning, so that's why

171
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,517
You know what, thank you.

172
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,153
These are great.

173
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,389
I'll go put these in water.

174
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,093
Noah?

175
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,327
Yep.

176
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,729
They're not even real.

177
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,405
This sucks.

178
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,182
Joe, I'm so sorry.

179
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,717
Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, that's rough.

180
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,387
Yeah it was.

181
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,389
Especially on Noah.

182
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:06,426
Towards the end, seeing
his mother like that,

183
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,396
Knowing there was nothing
he could do to help.

184
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,268
It really did a
number on both of us.

185
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,506
I know exactly how you feel.

186
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:24,544
We lost Chloe's dad, my husband,

187
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,214
To colon cancer three years ago.

188
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,449
I'm so sorry.

189
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,551
Thanks.

190
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,391
Let's talk about something,

191
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,093
A little less depressing.

192
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,462
I think that's a great idea.

193
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,167
So Jeff, huh?

194
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,570
Okay, good subject.

195
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,632
Hey, remember when
we were kids your dad

196
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,270
Wouldn't let us be in the
same room alone together?

197
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,438
Oh, the good old days.

198
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,507
We're all grown up now though.

199
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,242
Yes we are.

200
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,611
You were really cute
back then though.

201
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,381
Your glasses, your little curls.

202
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,350
What happened?

203
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,186
Well I don't have
the glasses anymore

204
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,821
And my little curls
are now big curls.

205
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:46,259
I have much bigger curls
than what I had before.

206
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,519
So I know you and
Noah have to get back,

207
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,421
But, we're actually
going to a cabin

208
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,424
On Friday if you'd
like to join us.

209
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,992
Oh.

210
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,363
That sounds really
cool, but I think um

211
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,366
There's just a million
things to do around here

212
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,534
You know, and Noah
has school on Monday,

213
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,203
So I think we're just
going to sit this one out.

214
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,240
Maybe next time.

215
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,402
Noah?

216
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,370
What was that?

217
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,273
Yeah dad.

218
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,896
Thanks.

219
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,065
Anytime.

220
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,934
It's good to have you back.

221
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,442
If you change your
mind, let me know.

222
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,377
I will.

223
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:38,731
Ouija, or spirit board, predates
to China around 1100 A.D.

224
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,769
People commonly use
the board as a way

225
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,505
To contact the dead.

226
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,077
Yeah. I mean what's the
worst that could happen?

227
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:55,515
Okay board, let's see
what you have to say.

228
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:24,544
I'm looking for my
mother, Jennifer Barnett.

229
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,116
Mom are you there?

230
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,953
Hello?

231
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,756
Anyone there?

232
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,525
Mom?

233
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,493
Grandpa?

234
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,629
Whoopi?

235
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,944
I knew this thing was bullshit.

236
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,554
Hello?

237
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,513
What the?

238
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,457
One. Never play alone.

239
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,529
Two. Never let planchette
count down through

240
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,632
The numbers or backwards
through the alphabet.

241
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,537
Three. Never mention God.

242
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,240
Four. Always say goodbye.

243
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,690
I mean, one out
of four ain't bad.

244
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,284
Hey Dad, does
grandpa have a cat?

245
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,587
I don't think so,
he was allergic.

246
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,888
Why?

247
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,790
No reason.

248
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:06,599
So, this is it.

249
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,235
Yep.

250
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,637
Look, if you change your mind

251
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,606
Here is the address
to the cabin.

252
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,375
Cell service can be a little
shoddy so just show up, okay?

253
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,644
Okay.

254
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,211
Come on, babe!

255
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,780
We're late for Jeff-town!

256
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,182
Population beers and burgers!

257
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,255
Take care of yourself, Yossi.

258
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,791
Joe.

259
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,826
Sorry, old habits.

260
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,695
Bye, Noah.

261
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,702
So, cabin?

262
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,637
No.

263
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:07,660
And you make
great sandwiches too.

264
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:10,663
What do you do?

265
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:14,266
What do you contribute
to the household?

266
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,703
You drink beer and
you watch football.

267
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:17,837
And I cook steaks.

268
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,205
Occasionally.

269
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,407
Only when I make you.

270
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,043
Who does the rest of the stuff?

271
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,713
Who fixed the sink the
other day when it got clogged?

272
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,684
What?

273
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,720
Nothing.

274
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,723
We're not going to the cabin.

275
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,925
Fine.

276
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,397
You always said that
grandpa never took you

277
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,267
Anywhere or did anything cool.

278
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,736
I mean it's not like
you're forcing me

279
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,370
To leave home like he did,

280
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,773
But I am going to college.

281
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:56,375
Don't you want to have
some fun before I go?

282
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:03,750
What are you doing?

283
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,051
This isn't our exit.

284
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,085
I know.

285
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,887
I'm just proving that I'm cool.

286
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,056
It's not cool if you
say you're cool dad.

287
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,758
Okay.

288
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:12,725
Well how about
this, I will promise

289
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,426
Not to tell anyone the
only reason you want to

290
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,797
Go to the cabin is so you
can hang out with Chloe.

291
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,431
Have I mentioned you're
the coolest dad ever?

292
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:22,134
It's not cool to mention it.

293
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,304
Hi guys, sorry,
you just caught me

294
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,040
At the end of my
sun salutations,

295
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,877
I'm working on my
yogi certificate.

296
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:07,079
You must be Beverly.

297
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,414
Nice to meet you.

298
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:11,283
Jeff. Hi Chloe.

299
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:14,453
Teenagers.

300
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,322
Well, make yourselves at home.

301
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,324
The door to the
main house is open,

302
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,426
I'm just going to shower up and

303
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,994
I'll show you guys around.

304
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,263
I'll be right down the
way if you need anything.

305
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,264
Thank you

306
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,934
Thank you. So much.

307
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,969
Get the bags.

308
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,807
What's a yogi
anyway though, a bear?

309
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,811
Yep. She steals
picnic baskets.

310
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:41,513
That's what I thought.

311
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,015
Let's go.

312
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,516
Jesus, this isn't a
cabin, it's a mansion.

313
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,319
It's like Pablo
Escobar's rustic getaway.

314
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,321
Would you uh, watch
your language please?

315
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,891
What? We're Jewish,
I can say Jesus.

316
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:27,193
All I'm saying is the cabin
is bigger than our house,

317
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,929
And there's probably a bunch
of cocaine hidden in the walls.

318
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:30,963
Hey!

319
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,865
What do you know about cocaine?

320
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,600
You know, don't, don't tell me.

321
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,467
Hey!

322
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,869
You guys made it!

323
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:37,603
Yep.

324
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:38,537
Good to see you.

325
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,505
Welcome.

326
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,174
Yeah he, guilted me
into it on the highway.

327
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,877
Plus I thought it'd be nice
to make some "cool memories"

328
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:46,412
Before he goes off to school.

329
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,579
That's really nice.

330
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,548
Chloe's inside and...

331
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,186
Jeff's at the market,

332
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,554
So why don't I show you inside?

333
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,889
Sure, yeah.

334
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,125
Jeff's at the market...

335
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,587
Sup dude?

336
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,056
Sup?

337
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:30,822
Did you guys change your mind?

338
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,059
Yeah. Yeah,
something like that.

339
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,294
How was the market?

340
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,196
Find anything nice?

341
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,298
Oh, you mean Ronnie.

342
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,368
Ronnie she's like
the yogi around here.

343
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,038
Takes care of stuff when
people are around, whatever

344
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:49,241
Recent divorcee.

345
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,045
On the prowl.

346
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,047
You know, because
she's a cougar.

347
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,649
Like an older, you get it?

348
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,618
No, I get it.

349
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,457
So how does Bev feel about you
doing yoga with other women?

350
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,993
You listen here, Rabbi.

351
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,095
If you even think about
opening your mouth to Bev,

352
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:12,031
You'll be in matzo straw
for the rest of your life.

353
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,700
That's not how matzo,

354
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:18,037
That's not how matzo works.

355
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,393
Sweet.

356
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:45,998
Hey

357
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:47,499
Hey, babe.

358
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,700
Where are you going?

359
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,036
I forgot the
bread at the market.

360
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,437
- Get it later.
- I can't

361
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,173
- We have our family hike.
- We can't have sandwiches without bread.

362
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,041
Okay?

363
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:58,010
You know the hike
is not my thing, okay?

364
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,046
I'll be back later.

365
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,248
Love you.

366
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,397
- Hey.
- How are you?

367
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,766
Better now.

368
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,241
Chloe?

369
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,143
Chloe!

370
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,544
Yes, mother.

371
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,646
We are going on a hike,
would you like to join us?

372
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,148
Are you serious?

373
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,082
I'd rather hang out
with Noah all weekend.

374
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,122
Looks like it's
just you and me, Joe.

375
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:51,790
Just like old times.

376
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,892
Bye.

377
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,760
Huh?

378
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:55,894
Bye.

379
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,429
Okay, bye.

380
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:09,508
I know you're there, perv.

381
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,925
How'd you get in here?

382
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,360
So.

383
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,662
So.

384
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,365
Jeff, huh?

385
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,302
Come on, he means well.

386
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,304
- Yeah?
- Yeah, he really does.

387
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,305
I mean I know he's
a pain and all,

388
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,906
But, he really is a good guy.

389
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,313
I met him online.

390
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:48,647
After my husband passed away.

391
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,217
Of course you met
that guy online.

392
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,218
What's that supposed to mean?

393
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,252
Nothing.

394
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,521
I just, uh, I guess I can't
really picture swiping

395
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,556
Right on that guy.

396
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,558
Swipe right?

397
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:02,361
Yeah, yeah, I've
seen Noah swipe right,

398
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,630
He's in his room just swiping,

399
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,465
At least I think it's swiping.

400
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,366
No, I've never swiped.

401
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,801
I don't believe in
swiping before marriage.

402
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:14,840
Bev?

403
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,242
Yeah.

404
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,610
You okay?

405
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,683
I don't know.

406
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:29,321
I think I made a mistake.

407
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:33,592
He means well and all,

408
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:37,263
But we're just two
different people,

409
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,933
And at my age there
aren't many options.

410
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:45,871
I find that pretty
hard to believe.

411
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,877
Watch out I can
still beat you up.

412
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,579
You can try,
bring it, bring it.

413
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:56,282
It's on.

414
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:11,563
Oh my goddess!

415
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:19,305
What's with all
the hippie shit?

416
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,873
I'm a shamanic priestess.

417
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,610
Well, I was ordained online.

418
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,414
I thought all
shamans were dudes.

419
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,817
Shamans by nature are women.

420
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,320
The first shaman was
said to be a woman.

421
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,554
Why do you think male
shamans are always wearing

422
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,989
Women's clothing
and assuming mostly

423
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:40,826
Female gendered behavior?

424
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,461
I don't know I just
thought they liked to

425
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:45,831
Wear dresses and
dress up like women.

426
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:50,736
So, since you're a
shaman do you like

427
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:55,006
Heal crap and talk to ghosts?
Or I don't know...

428
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,610
Yes, if I can properly
tap into the spirit world.

429
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,312
I can.

430
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,385
How about I
properly tap into you?

431
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:26,805
No, your dad.

432
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,774
Remember he wore that
really short miniskirt

433
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,676
That one year, where did
he even get that from?

434
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,811
Did you give it to him?
Weirdos

435
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,012
Don't, don't make me
think about that short skirt.

436
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,347
I don't want to
think about that.

437
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,515
He had the most hideous legs

438
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,683
And it kind of went
up in the back.

439
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:41,553
- Oh hey.
- Jeff, hi.

440
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,490
Did you just get
back from the market?

441
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:45,657
Yep.

442
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,560
You guys are awfully chummy huh?

443
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:51,363
Just catching up on old times.

444
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:53,732
Huh. I'd love to hear
about your old times

445
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,402
With my girlfriend, Joe.

446
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,039
Well Joe and his dad
used to dress up for

447
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,909
Wait, what was it
called again, Yos?

448
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,411
Purim.

449
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,013
Purim, that's right.

450
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:11,550
And apparently, there
was this Persian king

451
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,920
Who planned to have all the
Jewish people killed, and...

452
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:18,390
The holiday is to celebrate
the people that saved them

453
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:20,892
And foiled his plan, basically.

454
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,396
Bummer.

455
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,466
No, actually it
was pretty great.

456
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,401
I mean the girls used
to dress up like boys

457
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:31,703
And the boys used to
dress up like girls

458
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:35,474
And they would sing songs
and play with noisemakers

459
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,477
And it was really great.

460
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:43,482
Yeah, well, you know
shamans are actually girls?

461
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,689
What was that?

462
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,724
I don't know.

463
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,526
I'm confused.

464
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,562
Of course you met
that guy online.

465
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,465
Shut up.

466
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,600
Oh God, I did.

467
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,637
Smart phones, dumb people.

468
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,673
Salud.

469
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,712
I love you too.

470
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,782
Hang on!

471
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,020
Come in.

472
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:23,455
Hey.

473
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,223
What are you doing?

474
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,458
Nothin'.

475
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,626
Sure.

476
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,629
Dinner's ready, so
you should wash up.

477
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,231
And buddy you might want
to change that shirt,

478
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,901
You've been wearing it
for like, three days.

479
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,103
Fine.

480
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,106
Just looking out for you.

481
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,141
Okay, Dad.

482
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,643
Get out!

483
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:35,527
So, um, kids, did
you have fun today?

484
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:37,596
Oh yeah.

485
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:43,635
What about you Jeff,
did you have fun?

486
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,774
Jeff?

487
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,709
Jeff?

488
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,143
Huh?

489
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,546
Did you have fun today?

490
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,182
Yeah. It was fine.

491
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,588
Anyone seen my dad?

492
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:09,628
I'm going to go find him.

493
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,807
This is good.

494
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,353
Hey, we're all waiting
for you out here,

495
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,555
Noah, I thought I told
you to get ready for...

496
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:52,604
Noah?

497
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,275
What? I was changing my shirt.

498
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,779
Do you hear that?

499
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,381
Hear what?

500
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,784
Sup? Earth to Joe.

501
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:09,655
You coming to dinner or what?

502
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,858
Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,630
Smells good, right?

504
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:20,666
Yeah, smells.

505
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,601
But looks, like shit.

506
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:49,427
You alright, Dad?

507
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,929
Dad?

508
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,798
Your marshmallow's f-ed.

509
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,433
Oh. Oh, well I,

510
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,669
I like them burnt.

511
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:25,363
There's something out there.

512
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,672
Yeah dad, I totally think
something's out there.

513
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:45,050
Whoever's out there
better come out right now

514
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:48,920
Sorry, sorry, it's just me.

515
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:51,156
Just Ronnie.

516
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,926
Ronnie, what are you
doing in the woods?

517
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:59,130
Oh I just saw the fire
and I heard voices, so

518
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:06,137
Why don't you join us?

519
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:10,942
Here, have a seat.

520
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,050
Want mine?

521
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,821
No, I'm good.

522
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:30,896
Oh, sorry, Ronnie, this is
Joe Barnett and his son, Noah.

523
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:34,332
Joe, Noah, this is
Ronnie, she is the

524
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,768
Caretaker.

525
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,272
Yeah, how did you know that?

526
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,344
When I drove up I
saw her care-taking

527
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:50,415
Nice to meet you.

528
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,821
Sorry. I have to go.

529
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,791
Okay.

530
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:06,364
Hippies. Am I right?

531
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:11,236
Um, I'm going to
call it a night.

532
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,570
Are you okay?

533
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,339
Yeah, I just don't feel good.

534
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,273
Goodnight, Dad.

535
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:18,376
Goodnight.

536
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,414
Yeah I think your dad's right,

537
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,883
Maybe we should all hit it,

538
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:27,252
Don't you think?

539
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,586
Fine.

540
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,322
What? What's?

541
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:33,324
Kids. Bedtime.

542
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:34,425
Bedtime?

543
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:35,460
Mom, I'm 18.

544
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:37,095
I'm an adult.

545
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,164
Yeah, you are.

546
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45,503
Uh, 'night.

547
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,610
What's got her
panties in a bunch?

548
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,213
Why don't you ask Ronnie?

549
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,386
Wait for it, wait for it.

550
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,925
Shit.

551
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,035
You're acting crazy right now.

552
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:20,338
Don't you dare
call me crazy, Jeff!

553
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,642
Can you honestly tell
me nothing's going on

554
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,178
With you and Ronnie?

555
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,419
I cross my heart
and swear to die.

556
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:37,388
There's nothing going
on between Ronnie and I.

557
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:39,090
I slipped up once, Bev.

558
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:40,258
Now every time I look at a woman

559
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,993
You think I'm sleeping with her.

560
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,930
Can you blame me?

561
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,232
Fine. Believe what you want,

562
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:49,034
I'm going to bed.

563
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,068
Fine.

564
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,202
Fine.

565
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:22,400
Chloe?

566
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,447
Chloe?

567
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:44,615
Hello?

568
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,523
Hello?

569
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,127
Chloe is that you?

570
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,596
This isn't funny.

571
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,088
Mom are you there?

572
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:01,126
Mom?

573
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,135
Who is this?

574
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,575
Grandpa?

575
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,823
Danger?

576
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:35,160
What danger?

577
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,601
What's so dangerous about it?

578
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:55,146
Oh, okay Grandpa, there's
a demon inside the board.

579
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:32,450
What are you doing up so late?

580
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,852
I couldn't sleep.

581
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:37,388
What is that?

582
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:38,523
Nothing.

583
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:41,259
Nothing, huh?

584
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:44,695
Where did you get that?

585
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:46,364
Was this here?

586
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,398
Tell me!

587
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:48,533
I found it in
Grandpa's office.

588
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:49,700
Why did you take it?

589
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:51,402
I didn't, it was in the car,
I thought you brought it.

590
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:52,670
Don't lie to me, Noah.

591
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,939
I'm not lying, Dad.

592
00:52:57,242 --> 00:52:58,676
No, no no, please,

593
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,412
How will I talk to
mom or grandpa now?

594
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:03,414
They're gone.

595
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:05,550
From here, yeah, but
they're still out there.

596
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,218
Go to your room.

597
00:53:07,252 --> 00:53:08,553
We're leaving first
thing in the morning.

598
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:09,487
But, Dad?

599
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,356
Go!

600
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,594
Dad, please, I
was talking to her,

601
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:18,396
You have to believe me.

602
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,865
Enough. This
thing is not real.

603
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,234
Your mother and Dov
are not contacting you.

604
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,002
It's a figment of
your imagination.

605
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,003
Then why do you care?

606
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,405
Cause I'm your father

607
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:29,274
And you're going to
respect my wishes.

608
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:31,576
Now get inside and go to bed.

609
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:34,279
You're an asshole
you know that?

610
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,759
Dude. We're trying to sleep.

611
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:50,428
Joe.

612
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,298
I'll be out of here
first thing in the morning.

613
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,348
Joe, hey.

614
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,820
Do you want to tell me what's
going on with you and Noah?

615
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,455
No.

616
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:18,389
Look I'm getting all packed up,

617
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:20,891
We'll be out of here
before anyone wakes up.

618
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,893
No. Hey.

619
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:26,331
You don't have to go.

620
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:27,998
Joe?

621
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:29,300
We've been friends
almost our whole lives.

622
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:30,468
Really?

623
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:31,669
We're friends?

624
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:33,304
I mean I know we were
neighbors growing up,

625
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:34,572
But I haven't seen you,

626
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,272
I haven't even spoken
to you in 30 years

627
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:36,474
And now you think we're friends?

628
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:37,775
How dare you.

629
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,477
Do you have any idea
how much it hurt

630
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,646
When you sent away
the first time?

631
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:44,349
You just disappeared.

632
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:47,452
Now you're going to do it again?

633
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,594
Look, I'm sorry.

634
00:54:56,627 --> 00:55:00,398
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

635
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:12,577
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

636
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,847
Yeah.

637
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:20,751
We should sit.

638
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:44,375
Hey, everybody knows those
Ouija boards aren't real.

639
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:46,844
Come on, it's a kids toy.

640
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:50,381
Maybe, maybe Noah's
going through a difficult

641
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,383
Time in his life right now,

642
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:55,386
And you know he needs
someone to talk to.

643
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,988
He's about to graduate
high school this year

644
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:01,025
And that's sometimes
difficult to process.

645
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,027
Even home.

646
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:05,530
The night Max and
his family were killed,

647
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:06,664
You don't have
to talk about it.

648
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,933
No, Bev. Bev.

649
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:13,971
It's, why can't I remember
what happened that night?

650
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:17,174
Ever since I've been
here I've having snippets

651
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,709
Of that night.

652
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:20,711
Little bits and pieces
are coming back to me

653
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:23,481
But it just doesn't
make any sense.

654
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:24,715
I wish I could help.

655
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:26,517
You can.

656
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,419
Can you tell me anything
from that night?

657
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:31,556
Anything you may have heard?

658
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:34,759
Yossi, the things were heard

659
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,861
They were just rumors.

660
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,429
Can you tell me?

661
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:39,797
Please?

662
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,065
All I've ever been
told about that night

663
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,500
Is that I was in some
sort of accident.

664
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:45,102
That's it.

665
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:49,774
That's not what we heard.

666
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:54,579
Bev, what did you hear?

667
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:55,480
We,

668
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:00,685
We heard you,

669
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:08,459
We heard you lost
it or something

670
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:11,462
And you killed Max
and his family.

671
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,532
And when the police
showed up at your house

672
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:17,768
They found your dad
drowning you in the bathtub.

673
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:23,608
Your dad didn't send you away,

674
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:26,844
The state did.

675
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,648
If that's true then how
come my father wasn't arrested?

676
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:32,650
How come I didn't grow
up in juvenile detention?

677
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:34,585
I told you, they
were just rumors.

678
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,655
Yeah, well all rumors are
based on some sort of truth.

679
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:40,190
Look, this board isn't
going to be bringing

680
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:42,527
Back any more
bad memories okay?

681
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,996
You threw it in the
trash, it's done.

682
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,533
Right?

683
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:52,570
Out of sight, out of mind?

684
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,776
Come on, get some sleep.

685
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,546
Let's have fun this weekend,
okay?

686
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:09,520
Yeah, you're right.

687
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,256
You're right.

688
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:16,493
Always.

689
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,565
'Night.

690
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,605
'Night.

691
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,733
The church will look
after him as long as he can.

692
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:59,637
Whatever you do, do not
let him come back here

693
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,038
Until I figure out
how to dispose of it.

694
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:02,773
I promise.

695
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:04,742
But as soon as he's of age,

696
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:07,344
I can't stop him
from seeking answers.

697
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,748
I understand.

698
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,584
I just hope it doesn't
take me that long

699
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:15,986
To finish this.

700
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:20,290
Yousef? Yousef?

701
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,996
What happened to his eyes?

702
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:31,702
Matthew 6, verse 22 and 23.

703
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:35,339
The eye is the lamp of the body.

704
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:40,611
And if the eye is light
he'll be full of light

705
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:44,615
But if the eye is bad then
it'll be full of darkness.

706
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,319
Can you fix it?

707
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:51,321
I don't know.

708
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:53,824
But we'll try.

709
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,782
Hey, Chloe.

710
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:25,890
Noah?

711
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:30,394
Noah?

712
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,730
Joe, what's wrong?

713
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,164
Noah brought that
board back in the house,

714
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:35,800
Do you know where he is?

715
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,167
I think he went for
a walk down the hill.

716
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:38,368
Okay.

717
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:53,350
Noah!

718
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:54,852
What is wrong with you?

719
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:55,720
What are you talking about?

720
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:56,987
I didn't do anything.

721
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:58,322
You know what you did.

722
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:59,757
You took the Ouija
board out of the trash

723
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:00,725
And you brought it
back in the house.

724
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:01,558
No I didn't.

725
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,460
Then how'd it get
back inside, huh?

726
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,295
You know, you're about
to go to college buddy.

727
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,864
It's time you start
acting like a man

728
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,699
And admitting when you
did something wrong.

729
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,467
Dad, I'm telling
you, it wasn't me.

730
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,702
Then it didn't
just jump up and

731
01:01:11,736 --> 01:01:13,037
Go inside by itself.

732
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,740
Maybe it did.

733
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,307
What did you just say to me?

734
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,744
Maybe it did move by itself.

735
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:21,846
I know you don't believe
me, but it moved.

736
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,347
And I did talk to
Mom and Grandpa,

737
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,049
A few times actually.

738
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,751
It's called a spirit board, Dad.

739
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:28,986
That's what it's made
for, to talk to the dead.

740
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,988
Maybe there's a reason
we're not supposed

741
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,023
To talk to the dead.

742
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:35,760
Don't you start playing
with this stuff, buddy,

743
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:37,427
Your grandfather messed
around with this,

744
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:39,830
And look how he turned out.

745
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,800
Dad, wait.

746
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:58,048
Look, I'm not really
in the mood for

747
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:02,386
You to call me a creep or
a pervert or whatever, okay?

748
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,483
I'm sorry.

749
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:40,357
About everything.

750
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,462
It's just, I don't know

751
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,933
I guess I'm still processing
how my mom could move on

752
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:51,535
So fast after my dad died.

753
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,539
Especially with a guy like Jeff.

754
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,276
I don't know, maybe
it's better than never

755
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,846
Moving on at all.

756
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:04,849
At least you have
your freedom, right?

757
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,152
You'll have it soon.

758
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:10,821
You're going away
to school, right?

759
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:13,590
Yeah.

760
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,325
Part of me can't wait to
get the hell out of here

761
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,994
And live my own life.

762
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:20,030
But the other part of me can't
just leave him by himself.

763
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,503
Can I ask you a question?

764
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,439
Sure, I'll go
to prom with you.

765
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:30,941
I'm serious.

766
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,542
Sorry.

767
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,845
Sure.

768
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:40,417
Did you really talk to
your mom and granddad?

769
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:43,520
You're going to
tell me I'm crazy too.

770
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,855
No.

771
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:47,091
I'm serious.

772
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,531
I want to talk to my dad.

773
01:03:57,902 --> 01:03:59,369
I'd better not.

774
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,971
You saw my dad,
he's pissed as is,

775
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,372
What do you think he would do

776
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:03,207
If I got you involved?

777
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,843
Look, you saw me
naked so you owe me.

778
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:10,847
Okay.

779
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,984
But we have to do it
after everyone's asleep.

780
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:15,920
Okay.

781
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:20,290
Thanks.

782
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,454
Yousef! Run!

783
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:09,940
Dad, are you okay?

784
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:11,575
Where am I?

785
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:14,044
We found you on
the ground twitching.

786
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:17,414
I'm so sorry, for everything.

787
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:20,650
Let's not go saying something
we can't take back now

788
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:22,919
Thank you.

789
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:25,990
This is, uh, your place?

790
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,557
Ronnie's a certified EMT.

791
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,093
And a shaman.

792
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:31,261
I thought shamans were men.

793
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:33,130
It's a long story.

794
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,499
Bev was telling me
about that night

795
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:37,167
When you were younger?

796
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:39,269
Yeah.

797
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:42,639
All I remember is my father
drowning me in a bathtub

798
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:45,475
Although it wasn't me.

799
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:49,413
I was seeing through
someone else's eyes.

800
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:53,117
In fact, all of that
just came back to me

801
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,986
When I touched that board.

802
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,254
What board?

803
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,656
The Ouija board.

804
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:03,027
You have a Ouija
board back at the house?

805
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,996
Has anyone else used it?

806
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,435
It's okay, I followed
all the rules.

807
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,437
The Ouija board has rules?

808
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,472
Yes, as well as being
a conduit for spirits,

809
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:18,575
Spirit boards can also
be containment units.

810
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:21,111
Wait wait wait,
so you can contact

811
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:23,480
The dead and you can what?

812
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:25,515
Trap them in the board?

813
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:27,784
Yes. But as long as
no one else used it,

814
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,187
And Noah obeyed
all of the rules,

815
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,688
Then we should be fine.

816
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,092
Noah, what did you do?

817
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,393
I play alone.

818
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,727
You, what?

819
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:40,630
It's okay, I said goodbye,
we should be fine, right?

820
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:42,199
As long as Noah
said goodbye then

821
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,401
The spirit can't
escape, but it can still

822
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,803
Have influence and
try to find a way out.

823
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,406
This could explain your visions.

824
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:52,342
What happens if it gets out?

825
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,578
Possession.

826
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:56,180
Death.

827
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:57,714
Destruction.

828
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:01,118
Well, at least it
isn't something bad.

829
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,520
So, as long as no one
else plays with the board

830
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:05,089
We can get rid of it, right?

831
01:07:05,122 --> 01:07:06,723
In the simplest way, yes,

832
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,758
But I need to unlock
Joe's memories

833
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,727
And see if there's
anything that can help us.

834
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,496
You can do that?

835
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,199
You can unblock my memories?

836
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:17,234
I know a way, yes.

837
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,769
But it can be quite painful.

838
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,709
Do it.

839
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:27,744
Are you sure?

840
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,048
Yeah.

841
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:42,259
Close your eyes
and breathe it in.

842
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:46,530
These fragmented
memories you're having

843
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,433
Could be the result of
a memory block spell.

844
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:51,368
Like some amnesia spell?

845
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,736
Come on, my father
wasn't some sort of

846
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,371
Rabbinical wizard.

847
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,840
Eyes closed and relax.

848
01:07:58,142 --> 01:08:00,244
There are many hasidic
Jews who are well

849
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:02,546
Versed in mysticism
and the dark arts.

850
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,248
If your father didn't
want you to remember

851
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,582
These horrible things,

852
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:08,352
It's possible he
performed a memory block.

853
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,489
I need complete silence.

854
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,552
Yousef? Yousef?

855
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:08,712
- Belial.
- Belial.

856
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:10,647
What happened?

857
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,183
What did you see?

858
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:15,519
My father.

859
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,189
I was possessed.

860
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:24,294
I killed Max's dad.

861
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:29,199
I mean it did, when it
hopped from him to me.

862
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:31,401
It's not your fault.

863
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:33,937
You saw, right?

864
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:46,350
Belial, the wicked,
the worthless, one of the

865
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:48,718
Four crowns of hell.

866
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,455
We need the board.

867
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,542
Leave the lights on.

868
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:14,378
Sick.

869
01:10:14,411 --> 01:10:17,213
I used to have one of
these when I was a kid.

870
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:22,719
Is Joe trying to
do my girlfriend?

871
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,688
Where do you
think you're going?

872
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,256
To get the board.

873
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:27,457
And Chloe.

874
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:28,858
When I said you
needed to start acting

875
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:30,627
Like a man, I didn't mean now.

876
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,696
Better late than never, huh?

877
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,798
Look, Dad, I'll be fine.

878
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,666
Trust me.

879
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,470
Noah.

880
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:42,939
Bring Chloe back safe.

881
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,776
Does Ronnie like
it in the...

882
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:51,515
It's broken anyway.

883
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:56,520
Refill!

884
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:11,060
I need candles.

885
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,396
They're in the back.

886
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:14,564
Okay, I'll get some.

887
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,638
I can't leave my
son out there alone.

888
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,441
I have to go find him.

889
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,186
Jeff, now is not a good time.

890
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,622
Bev's here.

891
01:13:12,656 --> 01:13:15,759
Bev, Jeff is here!

892
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,128
Where are Noah and Joe,
did they get the board?

893
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:22,398
Jeff?

894
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:27,471
Jeff's not here.

895
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:29,839
Belial.

896
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:46,823
Ronnie, I found
these will they...

897
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:51,160
Jeff, what the
hell are you doing?

898
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,633
Even better.

899
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,481
Bev-er-ly.

900
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:15,719
No, what the hell, get off me.

901
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,557
Told you, I got it.

902
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,792
Will one of you weirdos
tell me what's going on?

903
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,494
There's no time to explain.

904
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:26,663
It's not safe out here, come on!

905
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,581
Bev-er-ly!

906
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:01,631
Bev-er-ly!

907
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,009
What the hell happened here?

908
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:15,612
It's us!

909
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:03,593
I'm alive, thank God.

910
01:16:03,627 --> 01:16:04,894
I'm alive, okay.

911
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,596
I'm alive.

912
01:16:08,632 --> 01:16:10,967
Don't thank him
just yet, cheater.

913
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:15,238
Bev, I know I'm a cheater,
just, please don't kill me.

914
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:16,272
Please don't kill me.

915
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,776
You broke my heart, Jeffrey.

916
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,811
I'm so sorry, Bev.

917
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,649
What's that old saying?

918
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:28,584
An eye for an eye?

919
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:37,894
And a heart for a heart.

920
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,963
Quick, get inside the circle.

921
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:41,330
Why?

922
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:43,767
Because spirits
can't pass the line.

923
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:47,837
We are in big trouble.

924
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:50,106
It is out.

925
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:52,075
What do you mean it's out?

926
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:56,612
Belial. Belial is out,
and it's taken hold of Jeff.

927
01:16:57,313 --> 01:16:58,414
Like possession?

928
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,348
Yes.

929
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:01,017
What do we do?

930
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:04,020
We need to get
Jeff into water.

931
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:06,089
The pool.

932
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,657
We need to lure
him into the pool

933
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:09,693
And you can exorcise him.

934
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:10,794
What? Me?

935
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:12,328
Why me? You're the shaman.

936
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:13,830
I don't read Hebrew.

937
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:14,831
I haven't read
Hebrew in 30 years.

938
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,700
You'll be fine, I hear
it's like riding a bike.

939
01:17:16,733 --> 01:17:18,134
Yeah, it's just
like riding a bike.

940
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,368
Alright, screw this,
I'm finding my mom.

941
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:21,905
No, stay, close.

942
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:25,008
You can't pass the line.

943
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:34,650
God dammit, Jeff
what do you want?

944
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:37,721
Yousef?

945
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,022
Mom?

946
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:40,824
Get off of me you dirty
hippie, I need my mom.

947
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,692
That's not your mom.

948
01:17:42,726 --> 01:17:45,028
It's okay, we'll save
her, I promise.

949
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:48,732
I'm not the one who
needs saving, bitch.

950
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:51,801
You slept with my boyfriend

951
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:54,938
And I won't stop till
I rip you to shreds.

952
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:08,451
Give me back my son
you piece of shit!

953
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,988
I have to help him.

954
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,890
Wait, it wants you.

955
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:15,391
Then why didn't it take me?

956
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:16,359
Why did it take
everybody but me,

957
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:18,261
Why did it take Noah?

958
01:18:18,294 --> 01:18:21,731
It wants to make you suffer
before it possesses you again.

959
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:24,133
Wait!

960
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,506
Psalm 91, read the
verse and you can

961
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,108
Exorcise the demon,

962
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,743
But make sure you
are both in the water

963
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:35,745
Before you finish the Psalm.

964
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:37,413
Okay.

965
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,852
It can't hurt.

966
01:18:44,788 --> 01:18:47,056
Like riding a bike, huh?

967
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:51,795
Joe?

968
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:53,763
Have faith.

969
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:54,057
Bev?

970
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,163
Beverly?

971
01:20:00,196 --> 01:20:02,165
Beverly?

972
01:20:05,869 --> 01:20:07,871
I'm so sorry.

973
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:09,372
I'm so sorry.

974
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:18,307
You can't save her, just like
you couldn't save your wife.

975
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,956
That's where you're wrong.

976
01:21:33,456 --> 01:21:35,091
Heart will befall you.

977
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:37,060
Heart will befall all of you.

978
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,294
Noah.

979
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:40,429
Noah isn't here, only Belial.

980
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:46,135
Sorry, the book wasn't
working fast enough.

981
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,249
It's not working, Ronnie.

982
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:01,550
Fight it to hold on,

983
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:04,220
The harder you try it
more it tears Noah apart

984
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:07,090
Before it moves on to you.

985
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:10,559
Then let's give
it what it wants.

986
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,461
Joe, no!

987
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:15,031
It's the only way.

988
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:18,167
Okay. Chloe!

989
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:21,004
Chloe, help!

990
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:23,006
I need my bag, Chloe!

991
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:44,693
I will haunt you and
your family for eternity

992
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:47,563
Until nothing is left
but rotting flesh.

993
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,370
Joe, are you sure?

994
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,705
We can still try to
trap it in the board.

995
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:58,174
No I don't want to trap it,

996
01:22:58,207 --> 01:22:59,275
I want it gone forever,

997
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,676
That's what my
father couldn't do.

998
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:04,047
Because it's a mortal sin
to try to take one's own life.

999
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,648
Don't you care about that?

1000
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:07,283
Are you willing to die?

1001
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:10,553
If it saves my son, yes.

1002
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,056
When it's done, do it.

1003
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:15,491
Don't hesitate, okay?

1004
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:21,097
We beseech you,

1005
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,565
Release this boy,

1006
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,300
We beseech you,

1007
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,135
We beseech you,
release this boy,

1008
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:27,236
Leave this boy,

1009
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,205
Leave this boy,

1010
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:30,339
We beseech you.

1011
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:49,392
I'm going to take
my time and enjoy it.

1012
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:03,706
Dad?

1013
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,244
Dad?

1014
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,513
Dad?

1015
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:11,747
I'm sorry.
