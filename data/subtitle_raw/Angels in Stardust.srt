00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,237
We better
be heading.

543
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,239
See you!

544
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,173
Bye.
Bye.

545
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,275
Don't do nothing
we wouldn't do.

546
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,144
Hey, what is that
supposed to mean?

547
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,512
We don't do nothing.

548
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,382
You speak
for yourself.

549
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:41,786
Maybe I should cast my bread
on the water more.

550
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,421
All things considered,

551
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,689
I think your dough
could use some rising.

552
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,191
(FIRE CRACKLING)

553
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,560
Suppose anybody'll
think I'm pretty?

554
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,128
Oh, yeah.

555
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,865
Yes, honey, they will.

556
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,902
More than that,
you're smart and talented.

557
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,137
Makes you
a triple threat.

558
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,544
There's more to the world than
Tardust and birthing babies.

559
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,980
What's a pollywog like you
know about the world?

560
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,316
I watch movies and read.

561
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,286
My teacher tells us stuff.

562
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,487
Uh-huh.

563
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,757
Did you hear
what Mrs. Bowes said

564
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,859
about that
woman scientist?

565
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,195
What, about being
born as poor as us?

566
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:25,563
No, Gomer.

567
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,032
Dying radioactive.

568
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,234
How messed up is that?

569
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,203
I do not want
to be a scientist.

570
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:33,938
I want to be like
Agatha Christie,

571
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,806
a great writer.
Heh.

572
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,075
How are you ever
gonna be a writer?

573
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,211
Poor kid
from the sticks.

574
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:43,047
Mrs. Bowes says Agatha didn't
have a father, just like me.

575
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,248
Except her Pa died.

576
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,584
Yours just
up and ran away,

577
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,085
loser in Chief.

578
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,387
VALLIE:
Loretta says men

579
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,323
want one thing
and women got it.

580
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,925
COWBOY: I don't know as
men are that predictable.

581
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,630
Some of us are quite
complex and sensitive.

582
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,502
I know somebody like that.

583
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:05,836
I know you do.

584
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,304
Not you.

585
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,341
Ah, that pretty boy
at school

586
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,076
you're always
gawking at.

587
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,978
He is not a pretty boy.

588
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,546
Well, hell,
he better be.

589
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:19,650
That's a lot of hanging
around and waiting for ugly.

590
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,253
VALLIE:
I do not gawk at him.

591
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:26,724
COWBOY: You stare at him like
a hound dog after a hambone.

592
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,292
That's gawking.

593
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,528
Well...

594
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,032
he's very affecting.

595
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,467
Hey, I saw you

596
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:37,835
fighting with those
boys at school.

597
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:38,837
What was that
all about?

598
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,004
I stepped on their

599
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,706
dumb old baseball
cards by accident.

600
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,942
Where'd you learn those
nasty words you called him?

601
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,710
I've been around.

602
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,513
Well, stop it. You're
using 'em wrong, anyway.

603
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,714
And pay attention to
where you're going.

604
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,016
Gosh.

605
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,751
I pay attention plenty.

606
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,052
Only to that darn
Indian, Tenkill.

607
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,987
Do not.
Do so.

608
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,189
I don't like it.
I don't trust him.

609
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,259
Hey, Pleasant,

610
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,395
I ever told you about
the native fire legend?

611
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,163
Uh-uh.

612
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,033
Well...

613
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,635
well, in the beginning
of time...

614
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,106
this world was cold.

615
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,675
It was very cold.

616
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:18,976
(SHIVERS)

617
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,278
But the thunders,

618
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,614
see,
they brought lightning.

619
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,848
Poom!

620
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,016
Crack!

621
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,418
(CRACKLES)

622
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,486
And struck
a hollow tree afire

623
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,188
on a distant island.

624
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,394
And, see, a Raven,
a screech owl,

625
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:41,165
they flew out there
to try to get that fire.

626
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,436
And, Raven
used to be white,

627
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,439
tried to pick that fire up,
and he burned hisself,

628
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,574
and that's why
he's black now.

629
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:51,675
Oh.

630
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:53,744
Yeah, and Screech Owl,

631
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:57,848
he rubbed his eyes
so hard from all that smoke,

632
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,985
that now that's why owls
got the big old eyes.

633
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:01,987
Hoo!

634
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:02,988
Hoo!
Hoo!

635
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:04,188
(LAUGHS)

636
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,727
Anyway, they couldn't find a
way to pick up that fire.

637
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,665
So finally
a water spider...

638
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,203
she came crawling
across that water.

639
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,841
She spun a tutsi bowl
on her back.

640
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,743
A what bowl?

641
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,177
Tutsi bowl.

642
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,213
Mean like
a Tootsie Roll?

643
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,583
No, it's just a bowl.
It's not important.

644
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:33,784
Can I finish my story?

645
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,920
I just don't get
the Tootsie Roll part.

646
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:37,988
Forget that.

647
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,057
This is
a plain old bowl, okay?

648
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,059
Okay.
All right.

649
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,293
So that water spider,

650
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:47,431
she... she put that ember
in her tut...

651
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:52,703
in a bowl and brought it
back across the water

652
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,004
to all the other creatures,

653
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,439
and forever after,

654
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,808
that's how the world
had fire.

655
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,878
Do Indians believe that?

656
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,047
Eh, not so much anymore,

657
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,883
but that's
a pretty good story, eh?

658
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,084
It's okay.

659
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,218
Not as good as those

660
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,020
Saturday-morning cartoons,
I suppose?

661
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,922
Not the "X-Men."

662
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,191
(LAUGHS)
Shoot.

663
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,562
You didn't tell your mother about
him hanging around Tenkill?

664
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:22,332
(LAUGHS)
Nah, 'course not.

665
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,468
She'd be pissed.

666
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,336
That a mighty queer
family.

667
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,338
Mother's hot
for cowboys,

668
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,541
and brother's
chasing after an Injun.

669
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:34,111
Well, Mom thinks
he's slow.

670
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:37,681
Doesn't seem like she'd
know too much about that.

671
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:38,816
No...

672
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,586
but schoolwise,
he's rickety.

673
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,555
WOMAN:
Pleasant's teacher and I

674
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,124
feel that he needs
tutoring, Mrs. Russell,

675
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:49,626
in a special
education school.

676
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,829
TAMMY: That's for
retards, ain't it?

677
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:52,831
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

678
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,932
Challenged is the term.

679
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,801
I think that it would be
better for his self-esteem

680
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:01,705
if he were with children
who didn't outperform him.

681
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,541
You think it'll be better
for Pleasant's self-esteem

682
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,944
to be situated
with a bunch of morons?

683
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,680
I think that's not the best way
of looking at it, Mrs. Russell.

684
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:12,416
Well, you look at it any
way you want to, okay?

685
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,884
I'm gonna need
to think on it.

686
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,523
Um, but you won't be kicking
my boy out, will you?

687
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,226
No. No,
of course not.

688
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,762
Okay. Thank you.

689
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,765
Come on.

690
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,034
Part with the
father rescuing...

691
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,202
There you are.

692
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,337
Hi, Ma.
Hello, Mrs. Russell.

693
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,973
Hello. Ready?

694
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,641
I was hoping
I could talk with you.

695
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,943
Oh? You're not
gonna tell me

696
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,311
my girl's an idiot,
are you?

697
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,380
Oh, my gosh, no.
Why would I say that?

698
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,948
She's quite talented.

699
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,049
Really?

700
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,285
Yes. Vallie is
a very good writer.

701
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,853
In fact,
she wrote a story

702
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:52,222
I'd like to enter
in a national contest.

703
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,925
What's that gonna cost?

704
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:58,662
Well, um, I'm sure the
school can pay any fees.

705
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,497
Okay, then.

706
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,233
Uh, you should really think
about sending Vallie

707
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,569
to the Latin School
in Oklahoma City.

708
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,805
Latin? What good's
that gonna do her?

709
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,840
That's just the name
of the school, Mrs. Russell.

710
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,074
Miss.

711
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,409
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

712
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,578
No, it's okay.
It's a common mistake.

713
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,014
Well, thank you,
Ms. Bowes.

714
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,649
Mrs.

715
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,051
Good for you.

716
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,653
Night.

717
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,156
Come on, Pleasant.
Let's go, bud.

718
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,357
Thank you.

719
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,792

I need to talk to you.

1436
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,120
Oh, I can't talk
right now.

1437
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:46,621
Well, Mickey and Old Ray
are after me.

1438
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:48,657
Oh, ignore them. They're
just trying to scare you.

1439
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,025
Yeah, they're doing
a good job.

1440
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:51,393
They just
ran me off the road.

1441
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:53,428
Oh, what did you expect,
that they'd love you?

1442
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:54,763
I don't have time

1443
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:56,498

1447
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,973

seeing, the rancher.

1448
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:05,975
So?

"So"?

1450
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:10,212
He's an ex-rodeo star,

1451
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:12,647

Mm-hmm.

01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:09,891
Thurley? Who's he?

1653
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,492

1654
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,028

And one time,
Skeet and Rooch

1658
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,938
gave him the noogies
with a file cleaner.

1659
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,241
I suppose Thurley
wears glasses.

01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,420
That scum that
collects on the creek

1787
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:15,489
where the current
can't carry it away.

1788
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:19,460
You don't want to mess
with us, Tenkill.

1789
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:21,929
No, you don't, Injun.

1790
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,131
(LAUGHS)

1791
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:26,634
Yeah.

1792
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:27,935
Well, boys,

1793
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:30,137
even if you two
can take me...

1794
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:32,173
which I don't
think you can...

1795
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:33,974
then you better be
up to killing me,

1796
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:35,876
'cause if you
leave me alive,

1797
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,379
I'll get a knife
or a gun,

1798
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,581
whatever it takes,
and kill you,

1799
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,583
everyone near
and dear to you.

1800
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:44,351
I'll erase
every trace of you

1801
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:45,853
from the face
of the earth.

1802
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:48,222
So the question you
gotta ask yourselves is

1803
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,857
do you want
to mess with me?

1804
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,864
What the hell's
the matter with you?

1805
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,435
The girl almost
put you in jail.

1806
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,704
Come on, now.

1807
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:05,439
What is it?

1808
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:07,608
You want her all for yourself?
Is that it?

1809
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:09,977
Then go ahead.

1810
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:11,145
You take her,
kemo sabe.

1811
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:12,880
She's all yours.

1812
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:14,548
Come on, Mickey.

1813
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,649
Come on.

1814
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:17,284
What the hell's
the matter?

1815
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:18,819
Let's go.

1816
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,728
(GASPS)

1817
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,898
Val, you okay?
Yeah.

1818
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,869
All right.

1819
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,804
Good.

1820
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:38,372
Where's Pleasant?

1821
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:40,141
He's safe.

1822
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:42,376
He's at my place.

1823
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,880
He is?
Yeah.

1824
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:47,148
All right, now come on.

1825
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:49,283
Let's get out of here.

1826
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:51,619
All right.

1827
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,279
I was always
scared of him.

1828
01:20:18,281 --> 01:20:19,780
COWBOY:
Understandable,

1829
01:20:19,782 --> 01:20:21,715
the way your mama
badmouthed him.

1830
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:26,120
And he's
really, uh...

1831
01:20:26,122 --> 01:20:27,188
He's really...

1832
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:28,522
Indian.

1833
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,458
Yeah.

1834
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,728
Yeah.

1835
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,797
The world's
damn confusing.

1836
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,568
Hard to know
what to believe anymore.

1837
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,017
(LAUGHS)

1838
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:31,185
Hey, Vallie.

1839
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:32,519
Hi.

1840
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:38,425
I almost
got you in trouble.

1841
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:41,996
Why'd you help me?

1842
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:50,804
Why'd you
get me in trouble?

1843
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,308
Thought I was doing
what was right.

1844
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:56,010
There you go.

1845
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:04,184
Why doesn't
my mother like you?

1846
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:05,519
(SIGHS)

1847
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,790
Well, it's not so much
that she doesn't like me.

1848
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,559
It's my kind.

1849
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:14,428
Yeah.

1850
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,897
The Indians.

1851
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:19,033
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

1852
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,036
Except rich ones, maybe.

1853
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:30,411
Pleasant
likes you a lot.

1854
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,448
I like him, too.

1855
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:38,886
You spend lots
of time with him.

1856
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:41,989
Yeah, some.

1857
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,097
Hey, did you, uh...

1858
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,434
give this to my ma?

1859
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,008
I expect I did.

1860
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,051
He's your son,
isn't he?

1861
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,657
Heh.

1862
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:20,394
Why didn't you
tell us? Huh?

1863
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:21,662
You're his father,

1864
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:23,564
and I accused you
of being someone that...

1865
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,033
Well, I...

1866
01:23:26,035 --> 01:23:28,102
I thought you were
a bad person. I did.

1867
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:32,506
Don't make
any sense.

1868
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:04,371
Hi, hon.

1869
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,073
Hi.

1870
01:24:06,075 --> 01:24:07,775
Been waiting
for you.

1871
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,010
We gotta talk.

1872
01:24:10,012 --> 01:24:11,545
Yep.

1873
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,114
Something wrong?

1874
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:17,818
Uh-uh.

1875
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:23,490
Got some
good news, hon.

1876
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:25,059
Oh, yeah?

1877
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:26,493
Well...

1878
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,264
Hoyt and me's
getting married.

1879
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:31,266
(LAUGHS)

1880
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:33,067
Married, huh?

1881
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:34,301
That's right.

1882
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:35,536
Wow.

1883
01:24:35,538 --> 01:24:38,172
That's good,
I guess, huh?

1884
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:39,273
It is.

1885
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:41,542
It is...

1886
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:43,744
and isn't.
(CLEARS THROAT)

1887
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:45,546
Why?

1888
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:48,816
Well, hon, I don't
know how to say it,

1889
01:24:48,818 --> 01:24:50,684
so I'll
just do it plain.

1890
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,319
Hoyt ain't fond
of kids.

1891
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:53,887
Fact, he don't
want any.

1892
01:24:53,889 --> 01:24:56,423
Which is fine by me, 'cause
I done that, but, you know,

1893
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,558
it presents
a problem, 'cause...

1894
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,026
'Cause of Pleasant and I.

1895
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:01,628
Well, yeah.

1896
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:04,164
What's he want to do?
Kill us?

1897
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,032
Don't be a smart-ass!

1898
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:06,667
He don't want
no such thing.

1899
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:09,636
Don't even know
about you.

1900
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:13,240
(CHUCKLES)
He doesn't know about us?

1901
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:15,976
I never told him. I just said I
was keeping my sister's kids

1902
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:17,678
for a while,
you know, for a favor.

1903
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,012
Ma, you don't
have a sister.

1904
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:20,681
Well,
that's not the point.

1905
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:23,484
The point is we
don't want any trouble,

1906
01:25:23,486 --> 01:25:25,719
so we gotta have
a plan, 'Kay?

1907
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,122
A plan?

1908
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:30,324
Yeah, suppose
you got one of those.

1909
01:25:30,326 --> 01:25:31,625
Well, I do. I do.

1910
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:33,293
You sit down, and I'll
tell you that plan.

1911
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,028
Sit. Sit down.

1912
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:36,030
All right.

1913
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:37,631
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

1914
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,900
Well, you know
Tinsy Johnson

1915
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:41,969
owns the Country
Kitchen, right?

1916
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:45,305
Well, she's offered to let
you stay there for a while

1917
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,241
and to work
at the restaurant.

1918
01:25:47,243 --> 01:25:48,475
Ain't that nice?

1919
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:51,311
And, you know,
Tinsy's got a son,

1920
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:54,081
gonna inherit
the place one day.

1921
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:58,051
Uh, I don't want
to work at Tinsy's.

1922
01:25:58,053 --> 01:25:59,486
Don't you
say that, okay?!

1923
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:00,587
You gotta help me!

1924
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:01,989
You're trying
to ditch me, Ma!

1925
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:04,591
I ain't doing
no such thing!

1926
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:05,959
I done right by you,

1927
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:08,629
and you're not gonna
spoil it for me now.

1928
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:13,267
This man is
my deliverance,

1929
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:15,536
and I need
something here.

1930
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:18,305
I need something
of my own.

1931
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:25,312
Okay.

1932
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:29,583
What about Pleasant?

1933
01:26:29,585 --> 01:26:31,518
Oh.

1934
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,754
Well, Pleasant...

1935
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:38,559
Pleasant
likes Tenkill,

1936
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:41,295
and, Tenkill, well,
I'm pretty sure

1937
01:26:41,297 --> 01:26:43,463
that he's gonna look
after him for a while.

1938
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:45,732
Fact,
I know he will.

1939
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,334
Okay, so you're
going to split us up.

1940
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:48,402
I'm not doing that.

1941
01:26:48,404 --> 01:26:50,003
You're gonna
see each other.

1942
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:51,638
Ma, why can't we
just stay here?

1943
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,173
Because if the county
folks found out

1944
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:55,342
that you was here
alone, I'd be in deep.

1945
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:02,282
Come on, baby.

1946
01:27:02,284 --> 01:27:04,051
Come on.

1947
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,855
You're gonna like Tinsy.

1948
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:11,525
I promise. Honest.

1949
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:14,962
And Tenkill is gonna
protect Pleasant.

1950
01:27:14,964 --> 01:27:17,030
I know he will. He will,

1951
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:20,133
just like he did you.
Okay?

1952
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,170
(GASPS)

1953
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:27,274
Pleasant,
look at you.

1954
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:30,644
I got 'em, but I ain't
wearing 'em all the time.

1955
01:27:30,646 --> 01:27:33,347
Okay, honey, but who
got 'em for you?

1956
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:34,648
If I tell,

1957
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,183
you won't take 'em
away, will you?

1958
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:37,651
Of course not.

1959
01:27:37,653 --> 01:27:39,620
Now, who bought 'em
for you?

1960
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:42,256
Tenkill.
He took me to the doc.

1961
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:43,890
He did?

1962
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,428

1972
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:49,109
Real shame.

1973
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,914
I used to watch a lot of
movies on that old screen.

1974
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:59,352
All my boyhood heroes...

1975
01:30:59,354 --> 01:31:00,821

1978
01:31:04,526 --> 01:31:06,560
I dreamed of being
just like 'em...

1979
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,863
thought if
I dreamed enough,

1980
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:12,466
that it
might come true.

stayed around here.

Pretty soon,
I stopped dreaming.

1983
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:27,080
So you
gonna do that?

1984
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,651
Just hang around here
all your life

1985
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,186
hoping for a miracle?

1986
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:37,657
I want to go
to Oklahoma City.

1987
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:41,928

1988
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:45,232
Heh. For what?

1989
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,269
Mrs. Bowes recommended me
for a scholarship.

1990
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,640
Oh. Well...

1991
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:56,543
I've got an idea.

1992
01:31:56,545 --> 01:31:57,711

1993
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:06,086
You know, I know this
woman in Oklahoma City.

1994
01:32:06,088 --> 01:32:08,188
Heh. She runs
a boardinghouse.

1995
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,024
It's for Indian kids.

1996
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,394

we could get you in...

Tenkill got tired of it

and burned
the damn thing down,

2016
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:27,233
maybe to break its hold
on Vallie Sue.

2017
01:33:28,302 --> 01:33:32,238
But Vallie,
she decided it was her.

2018
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:35,842
She willed it to fire,

2019
01:33:35,844 --> 01:33:37,310
'cause it was time.

2020
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,580
