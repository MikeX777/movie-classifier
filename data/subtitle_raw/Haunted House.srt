1
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:53,427
- All right, not
hunting for this guy today.

2
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:54,260
- Maybe.
- Hey,

3
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,670
focus will ya, you never know.

4
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,859
We could show up in this barn.

5
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,080
At the old homey homestead,

6
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,500
getting ready to peace out.

7
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,370
Mom and Dad just fed me
a nice, luscious supper

8
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,663
of burgers and salad.

9
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:10,205
And there's Dan.

10
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,470
I'm sorry there, Gerht?

11
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,885
- Like the good old days.
- Amen, brother.

12
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:17,827
Gehrt and I ...

13
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,859
Let's see if it focuses, oh, yeah.

14
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,990
Look it, it's us Gehrt.

15
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,870
Gehrt and I did some shootin'.

16
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,259
Cut to a montage of our shoots.

17
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:48,040
We're back, we just
wanted to do those shoots

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,683
to send some energy through the air.

19
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:52,913
To show the ghosts who
they're messin' with.

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,353
We're here to kill ghosts, I don't know

21
00:01:55,353 --> 00:01:57,001
about you, Gehrt, but--
- Yeah.

22
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,620
- That's why I'm in this business.

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,675
- Show 'em that we're serious.

24
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:03,780
- Serious, real serial.

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,921
- Deadly serious.
- Deadly.

26
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,901
With guns and things.

27
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,490
So, yeah, so we're about to head out to

28
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,140
good old Schaller, Iowa

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,625
and meet the Kole Knipfel,

30
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,970
that we have not hunted
with for a few years

31
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,107
at our old OG of CCPI.

32
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:25,180
So we'll have to come up with a crew name,

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,013
since we're no longer

34
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,636
CCPI Ghost Hunters.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:29,930
- We'll have to ponder
that through the night.

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,943
So stay with us.

37
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:37,793
We'll figure that out, onward, sirs.

38
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:49,805
What's that?

39
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:05,790
- It's Kole Knipfel.

40
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,623
- You know it.

41
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,852
- Oh my, it's also been.

42
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:10,373
- That's why you're wet now.

43
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,206
- A little bit.

44
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,626
You ready to hunt some ghosts?

45
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:18,164
- Sure, what's the story on this one?

46
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,270
- Just old classmate
of mine works there,

47
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,760
and they said a bunch of people

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,840
hear really weird noises
they can't explain.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,780
- Cool.
- I'm gonna

50
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,038
put this away before it gets too wet.

51
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,734
- We're here.
- We're here.

52
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:41,420
Because we're here.

53
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,593
You wanted us.

54
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,700
Now you got us, cut.

55
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,930
- I just wanna know a little bit

56
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,780
what you guys have been experiencing.

57
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,308
- Well a lot of footsteps, a lot of ...

58
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,300
We'll be working.

59
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,530
There'll be a couple of us,

60
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,400
and then we'll hear
footsteps and doors slam,

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
and we go upstairs to see what's going on

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,530
and there's absolutely nobody there.

63
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,510
- Wow.
- when we

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,393
first built this place,
we had a room over in here

65
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:13,560
that was kind of, we were
building a suspension bridge.

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,123
And it was pretty late.

67
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,120
We all kinda stopped

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,280
and there was a mix
between a howl and a moan.

69
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,080
It lasted for about 20 seconds or so.

70
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,640
- Wow.
- And, everybody heard.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,746
We all kinda looked at
each other like, "Okay."

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,430
We didn't do much more that night.

73
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,020
But yeah, just lots of noise.

74
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,196
We'll be sitting in here
at a break or something,

75
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:39,830
after working, and we heard
some stuff over that way.

76
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,850
We've heard some stuff
that way, just odd noises.

77
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,342
Just no idea of what it is.

78
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:48,453
We had a rocking chair
up on the third floor.

79
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:51,422
This has been quite a few years ago.

80
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:53,960
We ended up moving it
clear up into a little coop

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,140
on the fourth floor area.

82
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,747
And a couple times we'd go up there

83
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,720
and the chair would
actually be sit and rocking.

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,660
We never went up there really
see what was causing it.

85
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,810
- Oh, wow, that's awesome.

86
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,300
- They used to always
tell me these stories,

87
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,695
and I always ignored 'em.

88
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,060
Thinking it was crap.

89
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,893
We were working,

90
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,917
and there was four of us
standing right out here.

91
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:10,750
And you hear-

92
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,950
footsteps crossed
upstairs and a door slam.

93
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,247
- Oh, my gosh, man.

94
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,730
- It was pretty creepy.

95
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,130
- How long has
this been a haunted house?

96
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,635
- Started in 2005.
- 2005, yeah.

97
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:25,109
- It's an old, abandoned popcorn plant.

98
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:26,843
- Oh, wow, okay.

99
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,000
Being obviously doing
paranormal for so long,

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,532
we have a theory on ...

101
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:36,532
You guys make fear happen here,
and so energy glomps that.

102
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,010
I don't even care if nothing's

103
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,640
ever happened on this property.

104
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,947
That's like a beacon, and they're like,

105
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:42,668
"Ooh, that's where I wanna hang out."

106
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:45,343
And so, I'm not surprised.

107
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,313
But yeah, let's see this place.

108
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,529
Yes.

109
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,390
- Before this, this
was all just a hallway.

110
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,317
It was never anything.
- Okay.

111
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,030
- It was just plain wood.

112
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,210
- Gotcha, love
that, ain't that so sick?

113
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,590
- So there's a garage.

114
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,240
- Oh, see, this is
gonna damn me in the night.

115
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:10,040
- Was talking to a couple people,

116
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,840
and they said that they'd heard,

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,300
and I don't know if any of this true,

118
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,490
but they heard that one
guy had hung himself here

119
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,080
when it was a popcorn plant.

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,160
- Really?
- There is that.

121
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,930
- And that another guy got caught

122
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,157
in the conveyor hum upstairs,

123
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:27,050
and that the only way
they found out about it

124
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,644
was some guys were down on
break and his leg fell down.

125
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:31,920
Cut his leg off.

126
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,753
Whether that is true or not, I don't know.

127
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:33,800
- Right, right.

128
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,330
That's good legend, though.

129
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,730
Really fire some stuff up, dang.

130
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,957
- Casket.
- That's pretty big.

131
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,870
- That's a true casket, that's--

132
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,888
Really.
- Yes.

133
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:48,260
- That as as real
as it gets right there.

134
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,086
- Frickin' love it.

135
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,006
- Get this incorporated
like we want it to, but

136
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:48,278
Jacob's Ladder.

137
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:52,209
- Oh, are you, dude.

138
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,075
You know how-

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,970
much that powers paranormal activity?

140
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,970
- Really?
- Like crazy.

141
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,547
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

142
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,590
- It's gotten so bad in here

143
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,309
that we've had to spay Whitecell,

144
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,570
because there was so
much urine on the floor.

145
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,341
- Oh, my gosh.

146
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:10,860
- It's not exaggerating.

147
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,339
- No, I have no doubt.

148
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:27,094
- Don't look back.

149
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,287
- So we were corner.

150
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:38,557
We are in the Schaller
Haunted House right now.

151
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:41,850
Just about to get started
with our investigation.

152
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,210
This right here is Mr. Trent.

153
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,900
He works here and does a lot of building

154
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,130
and he also performs.

155
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,219
He's had some pretty awesome
experiences here, so.

156
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,540
He's along for the fun ride tonight

157
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,300
and hopefully get him some experiences

158
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,170
and also definitely us.

159
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,280
And I think we're just
gonna kinda start right now.

160
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,370
A little slow, just quiet.

161
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,023
Let things cool down here,

162
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,810
and just start with some pictures,

163
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,833
some eye on our photos, and yeah.

164
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:18,136
That's very good to meet curves.

165
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,323
I'm hearing a thump.

166
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,807
- I just heard something.

167
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,384
- My ears are going.

168
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:50,734
- I heard it too again, so.

169
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:56,247
- Does that
sound like footsteps or?

170
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,740
- It's hard to say,

171
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,040
it felt like running.
- Or is it the?

172
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,240
Right, but you feel
that bass though, right?

173
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,800
- Yeah.
- Unless it's the

174
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,503
Jacob's Ladder.

175
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,650
- I can hear it.

176
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,390
- I can almost
hear the Jacob's Ladder.

177
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,820
- I don't hear the bass, though.

178
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,170
Or I don't think the
bass would be with it.

179
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,180
- With it.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,810
It's all good.

181
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,997
- I was hearing.

182
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,283
- Yeah, I was
hearing the same thing, so.

183
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,031
- It's right there.
- Yeah.

184
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,230
- It's really hard to tell.

185
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,793
The Jacob Ladders isn't right above us.

186
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:53,380
Oh, okay.

187
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,864
- Still sounds like
it's off to the right here.

188
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,220
- Yeah.
- Off

189
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,803
to your guy's left.

190
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,041
- All right, this.

191
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,190
- So we're gonna do just a running

192
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,922
get section here for a few minutes.

193
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,020
Is there anyone in this
vicinity that can hear my voice?

194
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,648
That can speak with us?

195
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,680
Are you able to use the energy

196
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,518
from the Jacob's Ladder over here?

197
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:38,158
- Anybody hear that?

198
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,270
- Yeah.
- What'd you guys hear?

199
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,653
- Like a higher
pitch, almost like a voice.

200
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:52,351
- Are you able to make
that noise again for us?

201
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,207
My name is Seth.

202
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,023
This is Kole and Dan.

203
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,960
We were brought in by
Keith, Trent, and Derek.

204
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,955
We were brought here to
communicate with you guys.

205
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:15,403
To give you a platform to show yourselves.

206
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,680
This place showcases fake
ghosts and fake scares,

207
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,010
but we know you're real,

208
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,693
so let's show that there's
real ghosts here, real spirits.

209
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,110
All right, brought the ghost box.

210
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,798
If I can find the power
button before I speak here.

211
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,303
If I can find the power button before-

212
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:56,952
If I can find the power button.

213
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:59,363
If I can find the power button before-

214
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,719
Is there a female in
this building with us?

215
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,750
Try it.

216
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,490
Take our energy, take
the energy around you.

217
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,370
Speak with us, please.

218
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,881
What is your name?

219
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:33,346
Is somebody moving?

220
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:36,786
- He's right, though.

221
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:37,693
- Did you hear that?

222
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:38,526
- Somebody's coming through.

223
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:39,811
- Let's hone in on that.

224
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,197
- Oh, wow.

225
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:43,042
Here, have you listen.

226
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,800
- Yeah, okay, I got it.

227
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,100
- Hey, that was a voice,
sounds like a girl.

228
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,447
Wow, I'm focusing on that.

229
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:52,351
- When you least
expect it, you can hear.

230
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:55,115
- Can you repeat yourself?

231
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:57,037
I'm so sorry, I didn't hear you.

232
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,957
Can you repeat yourself?

233
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:02,449
Can you repeat yourself?

234
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:05,020
Can you repeat yourself?

235
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:13,903
That guy, that sound--
- Nice.

236
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:16,666
How old are you?

237
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:23,641
- On the sign behind you.

238
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:25,294
- Oh, "Have a nice death."

239
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,685
Thank you.

240
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:33,100
If you can channel yourself
through that white noise,

241
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,420
appear to us, appear to this camera

242
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,270
so that we can show the
world that you exist,

243
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,533
that you are here, that you are
not forgotten, please do so.

244
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,599
Again, I'm just gonna
ask, what is your name?

245
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,537
- That was me.

246
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:03,680
All right, I just saw, it
could've been dust in here,

247
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,767
but I just saw an orb go
straight in your mouth

248
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,040
and then come out of your mouth

249
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,088
and disappear over here.
- Whoa.

250
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,413
- Watch out.

251
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:37,479
Seth.

252
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,578
- What is this building used for?

253
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,083
- Haunted.

254
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,204
- She said, "Haunted," wow.

255
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:10,460
- Run.

256
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,965
- Who is here with us right now?

257
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:33,169
- Can you say one of our names?

258
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:35,742
Gehrt.

259
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,305
- How did someone die in this building?

260
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:56,933
- Rope.

261
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:01,628
Hung, dead.

262
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,400
- Before I shut this off,

263
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,565
does anyone wanna say anything else?

264
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:29,580
Oh, thanks.

265
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,868
It's focused on that too hard.

266
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,275
- What do you want,

267
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:38,818
just sit and see if we get anything?

268
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,023
- Yeah, I think we should.

269
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,506
- Yeah.
- What was that?

270
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,509
That was me,

271
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,702
I'm sorry.
- Damn.

272
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:51,415
- I was testing this.

273
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:53,413
- Down there.
- I heard it, too.

274
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,683
It was this,

275
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,516
but I don't this it is.
- No.

276
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,349
Like a higher pitch.

277
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:04,370
I heard it to my right.

278
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,820
Did you hear it, Kole?
- No.

279
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,683
- You're recording, right?
- Yeah.

280
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:10,750
- The money maker.

281
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,834
- A little Daniel action here.

282
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:24,673
Excuse me.

283
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:27,162
- This must be high up.

284
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:31,517
- Oh, yeah.

285
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:48,940
Oh, you went all the way
over there, huh, Dan?

286
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,810
It's so hard for me with
these frickin' props.

287
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,088
I can't imagine doing the wax museums.

288
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,598
Oh, my God.
- Pitch black.

289
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,931
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

290
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:25,593
- What was that?

291
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,584
- That the wind?

292
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:32,664
- I don't know.

293
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,114
I think that's a skull right there.

294
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,214
- Yeah.

295
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:35,214
- Yeah.

296
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:43,893
- Someone just wanna
to shut the light off for me?

297
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,540
See this light?
- Right here?

298
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,336
- Something just ran across it.

299
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:52,702
I'm 100%, towards, yeah, so.

300
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,970
It would've been towards us,

301
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,040
but it's something down the hallway.

302
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,133
It's 100%, I saw somebody.

303
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:08,080
So we were just down over by the maze,

304
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,874
so it'd be the exit of the maze,

305
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:12,649
and we went down there
earlier when Trent was here.

306
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:14,850
And we were just kinda sitting there,

307
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,083
asking for stuff to happen, it was quiet.

308
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,300
So the hallway where the check-in area is,

309
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,220
is a light on, and it's
shining down on the wall.

310
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,920
And I turned to look at Kole,

311
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,030
and I looked at the light on the wall,

312
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,789
and I see clear as day a shadow.

313
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,416
From kind of what we
compared with Kole and stuff,

314
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,670
it was probably about six foot tall,

315
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,590
and it just waltzed
right across that wall.

316
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,510
It was human, I could see the
face profile and everything,

317
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,880
just walked right across there.

318
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,587
And just whole atmosphere changed.

319
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:56,560
But then it was quiet.

320
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,340
I'm not sure what's going
on, but I definitely seen

321
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,133
a shadow person here at
Schallers's Haunted House.

322
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,910
You have the match on?

323
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,000
- What's going on, Seth?

324
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,433
- I swear I just heard
footsteps, I don't know.

325
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:14,323
And then I was feeling that bass again

326
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:18,243
that I was feeling earlier
literally almost in my core.

327
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:28,107
It literally sounded like someone
just started going across.

328
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:36,950
I don't know.

329
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,380
But we've been in here for a few minutes

330
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,217
and I wasn't feeling all of a sudden.

331
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,610
- yep.
- I cannot

332
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,799
put my finger on this place.

333
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,343
I truly feel it's all residual.

334
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:59,254
But some of this down, I don't know.

335
00:24:59,254 --> 00:25:00,636
- We know what the story's about.

336
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,400
Someone hanging, but not
everywhere that someone dies

337
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,240
is haunted, so.
- All right.

338
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:08,630
- And we've only
been here one night.

339
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,174
- It could be an off-night.

340
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,900
- Or we could be missing
a lot with the rain, too, so.

341
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,850
- I've never had much luck
on a rainy night before.

342
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,850
Come up, and he goes, "I wanted to go."

343
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,640
- Got approx four
minutes left on this.

344
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,733
- Four minutes? Okay.

345
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,640
But yeah, that is so freaky.
- Oh, man.

346
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,038
- So frickin' freaky.

347
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,020
We were all doing a little ghost hunt

348
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,070
upstairs in his office.

349
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,610
Then we had to sleep
there and I was terrified.

350
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,280
I still can't sleep in his house.

351
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,420
- Seriously, did you sleep,

352
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,718
were you the one that
slept in front of the door?

353
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:48,718
Or was that--
- No, that was DJ.

354
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,500
I think Haunted Iowa.

355
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,560
- It was in the playroom
that where we slept.

356
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,130
- Yeah, DJ slept against the door.

357
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,638
- Okay.
- Him.

358
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,798
I slept in the other room.

359
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:00,401
- You hear that?
- Shh.

360
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,440
- I heard that, too.

361
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:16,502
There it is.

362
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:18,630
How much time we got?

363
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,983
- One minute.
- Movement upstairs.

364
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,951
- Zero minutes.

365
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:10,260
- Dang it.
- Lights and phone.

366
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:17,893
- Okay, we're hearing movement
upstairs, loud movement.

367
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,643
- Still?
- Oh, yeah.

368
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:57,654
Oh my gosh, clear as day.
- Yeah.

369
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:14,160
- I seriously, are you still recording?

370
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,420
- Yeah.
- Okay.

371
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,710
I seriously am thinking right
now that someone came back.

372
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,168
- Yeah, it's that--
- The front door locked?

373
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,697
- Yeah.
- Front door's locked?

374
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:25,080
- Yeah.
- So it's not

375
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,520
a stranger walking in?

376
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,353
- Maybe it's someone with--

377
00:28:27,353 --> 00:28:29,100
- It's not an animal?

378
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,150
- No.
- It's heel to toe footprints?

379
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,060
- Yeah, and it's moving about like,

380
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,010
I would not be surprised
if there was doors.

381
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,976
It sounded like a door opening.

382
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:40,417
Like the spring-loaded stuff.

383
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,110
- Talking about past experiences.

384
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,899
- It works.

385
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:46,393
- Every time.
- Every time.

386
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,816
- Do you wanna go and check?

387
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:53,917
- Yeah, I'm trying to think.

388
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,357
So we've have to go
this way up the stairs.

389
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:57,515
- Just go back the same way.

390
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:58,348
- Okay, go.

391
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:00,074
I wonder if you can
take the auto-recorder.

392
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:02,314
- Your luck.

393
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:04,494
Did anyone take the steps?

394
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:08,161
- I mean, I'm
just gonna do it again.

395
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,373
No, I just ran steps behind this.

396
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:30,386
- There's movement in this room.

397
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:34,101
- You hear anything?

398
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:39,449
- You hear it?

399
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,866
Do you hear it?
- Yeah.

400
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:06,827
- Go, take this.

401
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,042
- Do you know how
to turn the light down,

402
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,709
that should be good.

403
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,039
- Stupid house.

404
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,770
Dude, there's no one here.

405
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,843
- No one?

406
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,448
Dude, you and me heard
these things moving.

407
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:01,560
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

408
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,240
- There's no way no one
could've gotten on that side.

409
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,314
We can either go back that way,

410
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:14,680
so we don't have to go through that.

411
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,300
Then we can go up the stairs if we want.

412
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,410
- I say we go back,

413
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,500
and the floor up here almost sounded

414
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,050
like the footsteps we were hearing.

415
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,307
- Yeah, but it was above us, though.

416
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:28,786
I heard the first--
- We go up?

417
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:30,211
- Yeah.
- We go up?

418
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:31,731
The ramp right there.

419
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:33,914
- Oh, that's true, but

420
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:36,120
we're not above us, though.

421
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,953
- I didn't hear it.

422
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:39,150
I heard it above but at an angle.

423
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,363
- Oh.
- I didn't

424
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:42,830
hear it like directly above us.

425
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,840
- Oh, wow, okay.

426
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,870
See, I thought it was above us,

427
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,477
but yeah, that could definitely ...

428
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:49,823
Then they were in this room.

429
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:51,115
- Oh, yeah, could've been.

430
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:54,090
- Oh, my gosh.

431
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,976
- Yeah, let's go back.

432
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:56,809
- Okay.
- See if we

433
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,642
can hear it again.

434
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,233
Hey, you guys go back to the hallway.

435
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,172
- Okay.
- And I'll walk.

436
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,374
- Okay, yeah, absolutely.

437
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,414
Who is here, and you're left.

438
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:59,038
That's it, Derek, that's it.

439
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:01,169
- That's it.

440
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,002
- That's totally it.
- Yeah.

441
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:03,616
- Something was coming down to us.

442
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:04,994
- Oh, my gosh.

443
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,893
- That was it.

444
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,291
- There's literally a frinkin' ghost

445
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,071
right on the other side of this wall.

446
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:19,113
Right on the other frickin'
side of this wall right now.

447
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,990
- Yes.
- Almost 20 years doing this

448
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,877
and that still blows my mind.

449
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:28,013
Oh, my gosh, dude.

450
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,180
F-ing awesome, and we
have to have caught it.

451
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,473
- Yeah.

452
00:34:36,656 --> 00:34:39,050
And there's only three of us.

453
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,917
- There's only, yeah.
- There's no one else.

454
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,060
- No, and we have the safety
net of those frickin' tire

455
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,530
or those little trainer joses.

456
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,660
- Unless someone
crawled underneath 'em.

457
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,167
- Yeah, and they wouldn't get back--

458
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,890
- Or scaled the rafters.

459
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

460
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,923
- No, absolutely not.

461
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:01,433
Holy crap, dude.

462
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:07,440
We are wrapping up right now,

463
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,920
and we are hearing loud bass-y movement,

464
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,493
like thumps and bangs upstairs.

465
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,353
She's like so immature to this.

466
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,033
Hear it?

467
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,633
Dragging gurges or what
might've been a shriek.

468
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,420
- This is concrete floor.

469
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,443
It's not us.
- It's not us, no.

470
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,580
There is literally movement of something.

471
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,540
It literally sounds like somebody's

472
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,890
moving stuff up there and dropping it.

473
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,310
It almost sounds like the frickin'

474
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,525
haunted house is going on.

475
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,680
That's what it reminds me.

476
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,689
The frickin' thing slamming open.

477
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:19,906
- Yeah, that's what.
- That's what.

478
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:22,530
Dude, yeah, that's what
it sounds like to me.

479
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,126
Sounds like if the walls dropped.

480
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:25,393
- Real bass-y.
- Right.

481
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:28,468
- That first one that vibrate
all the way down to the floor.

482
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:31,180
That exactly sounds like,
because that's loud,

483
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,013
if someone had dropped something.

484
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:33,709
- Yeah, it's super loud.

485
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,449
- Bong, and then.

486
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:37,480
- We're sitting
here talking about Squatch,

487
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,773
and all of a sudden just
stuff starts happening.

488
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:44,020
- Definitely, is it again?

489
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,853
- What that you?

490
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:45,999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

491
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:50,213
It's like it's trying to
get our attention almost.

492
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:52,680
Or it's like they don't
think we're listening

493
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,380
or paying attention, so it's
like, "Okay, here we go."

494
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:58,583
- There it goes again.
- Another one.

495
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,753
- Yeah, there it goes again.

496
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:01,430
- That's, I'm hearing it up here.

497
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:09,325
We seriously have been
down here multiple times

498
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,760
for an extended period of times,

499
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,306
and we've not heard this bass, deep drops.

500
00:37:15,306 --> 00:37:18,653
Footsteps.

501
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:27,395
This is so awesome, wow.

502
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:36,810
Again, we are literally packing
up to leave, as you can see.

503
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:41,085
All our stuff has been packed
up, and all of a sudden,

504
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:43,405
everything is just going down right now.

505
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,355
- Footsteps.
- Yeah.

506
00:37:59,347 --> 00:38:00,915
- Did you hear that voice?

507
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,710
- I heard something,

508
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,837
but I wasn't paying attention to it.

509
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:24,504
- I hear a movement there
and a voice out here.

510
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,083
- Holy crap, dude.

511
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,163
- I thought I'd say we
go in with a flashlight.

512
00:38:51,443 --> 00:38:55,200
Do some filming, that's
what we came here for.

513
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,150
- It's true.

514
00:38:57,646 --> 00:38:59,887
Okay, I guess not.

515
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:03,381
Whoa, that wasn't you?

516
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,896
Oh, my gosh.

517
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,463
Ready, boys?
- Hold on.

518
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,885
All right.
- God be with us.

519
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,260
- Where do you wanna go?

520
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,090
- Clean out here.

521
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,133
- Okay.
- Walk in.

522
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,213
- Oh, in here.

523
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:48,113
- Guess it's quiet, just listen.

524
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:04,986
- I just heard frickin'.

525
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,943
- Never heard anymore bangs.

526
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:28,026
- Me neither.
- No.

527
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:39,979
- You wanna start telling stories again?

528
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:45,004
- So just now, holy crap, I wonder.

529
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:48,203
We could hit Squatch way back there.

530
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:53,033
Very possible.

531
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:59,770
- Bang.
- Yep.

532
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,433
That was a thud over here.

533
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:25,384
Whoa, what was that?

534
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,653
- It came from over there.
- Yeah.

535
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:37,995
- Was that downstairs?

536
00:42:37,995 --> 00:42:38,828
- That was downstairs.

537
00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:42,578
- That sounded
like it was downstairs.

538
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,503
Oh, my gosh.

539
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,943
It literally sounds like somebody's

540
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,863
just walking through, slamming doors.

541
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,647
Okay, I'm getting creeped out.

542
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:27,911
Open that up, just push
it open just a bit.

543
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:29,293
- Just like how you did.

544
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:39,070
- Oh, my gosh, awesome.

545
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,340
- There it goes again.

546
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,483
- I wanna find that door, though.

547
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:49,913
What's the quickest way to
get over there on this level?

548
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:54,333
We gotta go down and then we gotta go

549
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,810
into the frickin' body room,

550
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,371
which I've literally
avoided all night long.

551
00:43:58,371 --> 00:43:59,690
- Oh, the body room.

552
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,540
- Yeah, the frickin' chainsaw.

553
00:44:08,892 --> 00:44:12,475
But what's so weird is
this frickin' empty.

554
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:15,335
That's not a door.
- That is.

555
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:17,553
- No, that's not a frickin' door.

556
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,295
Rumbles, like.

557
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:22,203
Like someone running.

558
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,133
Again.
- So there's something.

559
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,370
We don't need to find out F-ing doors

560
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,770
'cause something's are here.

561
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,900
What the f--
- That was a door.

562
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,733
- That was a door.

563
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,604
- That was back and forth.

564
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:05,684
- Man.

565
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:09,558
Wanna try and get over there?

566
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:12,185
- Sorry, it's just frickin'.

567
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:16,110
That room just so does
not sit well with me.

568
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,300
'Cause we can't go through the maze.

569
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,210
I'm not going through the
maze, so as far as we go,

570
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,547
we have to come back.
- That's fine.

571
00:45:26,936 --> 00:45:30,727
- Not sure exactly
where we're going.

572
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,449
I think you just go to the right.

573
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:34,242
We'll take it to the bottom of the steps.

574
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:35,344
- You got another light?

575
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:44,160
- It's got 10%, it should not shut off.

576
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,110
All right, push close.

577
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,487
- Seth, what just happened?

578
00:46:46,487 --> 00:46:48,713
- My frickin' phone just shut off.

579
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,489
Okay, real quick.

580
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:02,369
We've literally just went out.

581
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:03,990
You'll see on the phones.

582
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,230
We were walking through,
and all of a sudden my phone

583
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,870
just dies as we walk into the room

584
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,646
I haven't wanted to go to all night.

585
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:13,591
- The ones with the

586
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:14,424
bodies.
- The ones with

587
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:15,257
the bodies hanging.
- And the machete.

588
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:18,130
- And the machete, and then so.

589
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,550
- I took out my phone, which was off.

590
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,733
I had to turn it on.

591
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,490
It was at 65% when I turned it off, and

592
00:47:28,204 --> 00:47:32,900
the charging cable showed up as trying to.

593
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,330
- Yeah, and you literally tried

594
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,163
to record me, didn't you?
- Turn on.

595
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:36,683
I just turned my phone on, look at it.

596
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,290
- It's booting up.
- Yeah.

597
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,340
- What the, okay, so.

598
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:42,620
- See how much
battery juice it has.

599
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,470
- So he has that.

600
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:49,470
Mine turns back on,
and it has 10% battery.

601
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,870
I'm literally looking at it,

602
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,870
and all of a sudden it's just 2%.

603
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,187
And I'm like, "Quick, hit the camera."

604
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:57,403
And then 1%, done, just gone.

605
00:47:58,896 --> 00:48:00,903
Oh, my gosh.

606
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:06,783
- 38.
- What?

607
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:10,907
- 38%.

608
00:48:10,907 --> 00:48:14,723
- I don't know what
needs that much energy.

609
00:48:16,122 --> 00:48:18,233
I don't know.

610
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,127
All right, let's do this
quick, 'cause I'm over it.

611
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:32,120
Not that this is the
greatest thing ever, but.

612
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,643
Whoops.

613
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:43,410
So we got all our batteries
drained and what do we do?

614
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,411
We go back.

615
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:26,884
How's your phone?
- 19.

616
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:31,423
- It was just at 38.

617
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,853
What the heck, man?

618
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:45,500
And it's funny because I
have literally not wanted

619
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,913
to come down to this room all night long.

620
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:50,123
'Cause it freaks me out.

621
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:30,090
- I'm trying to track down
the bags that were here

622
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:34,550
and whether it's a door or
not, and I'm trying to debunk

623
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,023
that if it's a door banging
because of the wind.

624
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:39,743
- It's just silent.

625
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:44,573
Whenever we try investigating
it, it just goes silent.

626
00:51:09,992 --> 00:51:11,672
No, exactly.

627
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:13,005
All right, boys.

628
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,357
Lights out.
- Night, night.

629
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,247
- All right, dead dash to the van.

630
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:33,465
- Made it.
- We made it.

631
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,845
It literally turned out
like I wanted it to.

632
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:42,390
- It was a good investigation.

633
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,223
- It was.
- On to the next.

634
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:44,600
- On to the next.

635
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,350
Look, my phone's starting right up.

636
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:48,586
It was dead.
