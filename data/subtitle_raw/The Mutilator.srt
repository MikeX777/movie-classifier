1
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,310
Mama, Mama!

2
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,960
<i>We're goin' on a...</i>

3
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,040
<i>A fall break</i>

4
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,040
<i>Runnin' in the sand feelin' all right</i>

5
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,550
<i>Feelin' all right...</i>

6
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,690
Fall break, and here we sit.

7
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
No plans, nothing to do.

8
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,150
I've been warning you since September.

9
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,280
Go to the beach,
go to the mountains, do something.

10
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,240
Don't say I didn't tell you so.

11
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,740
Well, why didn't you make
some reservations?

12
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,350
I should have,
but you guys never agree on anything.

13
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,010
So, we'll sit around here
just like we did last year.

14
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,980
It's depressing.

15
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,360
Hey, Ed, uh, you have a telephone call.

16
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,690
Right.

17
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,070
No, seriously, you have a telephone call.

18
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,950
Well, what do you know?

19
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,200
Ralph said what he meant for a change.

20
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,110
Yeah?

21
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,630
My dad?

22
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,080
Yeah, OK. Uh-huh.

23
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,720
Well, anybody got
any good ideas for break?

24
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,220
I'm gonna set a new high score
on the video machine.

25
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,750
I'm gonna watch.

26
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,850
How about you?

27
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,800
Well, actually, I was relying on you
to make the arrangements.

28
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Oh, Ralph.

29
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,010
Anybody got any paper?

30
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,090
It's a message to call my dad.

31
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,820
From a phone booth, for Christ's sakes.

32
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,870
I thought Ed's father was dead.

33
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,250
His mother is dead.

34
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,110
God, it was a terrible accident, too.

35
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,670
What happened?

36
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,550
When he was a little boy,
Ed accidentally shot her.

37
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,410
Oh, ho-ho, man...

38
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,680
- Drove his father crazy.
- I can understand it.

39
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,100
You know, I really can't...

40
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,560
Dad?

41
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,640
I don't believe it.

42
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,270
Don't believe what?

43
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,150
My old man.

44
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,270
What's up?

45
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,360
He's having another one of his spells.

46
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,010
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, what kind of spells?

47
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,700
The kind that come in bottles.

48
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,430
Well, what's the problem?

49
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,280
Will you let the man talk?

50
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,230
He wants me to close up
his condo for the winter.

51
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,110
Oh, that sounds like work.

52
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,400
What's the matter?
Big strong you, afraid of a little work?

53
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,110
Oh, he just has to save his strength
for more important things.

54
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,920
- Right.
- It's not it.

55
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,160
I mean, all my life the creep's ignored me,
and treated me like some redheaded bastard.

56
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,460
Um...

57
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,930
Oh, sorry.

58
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,440
Now, all of a sudden, he calls me up
and asks me to do something.

59
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,090
Tells me I'm old enough to
"take the responsibility."

60
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,190
What'd you say?

61
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,510
I told him to do his own work.

62
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,740
What'd he say?

63
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,820
He said if I didn't do it,
it wouldn't get done.

64
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,940
"Face it like a man."

65
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,210
And I'm not gonna do it.
I mean, what a jerk.

66
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,000
How much work?

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,480
"Turn off the water,
turn off the electricity,

68
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,610
"pour some antifreeze in the plumbing."

69
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,260
"Any 10-year-old can handle it."

70
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,470
Uh, did you say,
any 10-year-old can handle it?

71
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,260
- It's a snap.
- Nothing to it.

72
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,270
We can handle that.

73
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,810
Yeah, how come we didn't know
you had a condo at the beach?

74
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,950
No way.

75
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,460
What do you say?
Four days of R&R at the beach.

76
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,280
- I'm in.
- She's in, I'm in.

77
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
Sounds good to me.

78
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,010
I got a bad feeling about this.

79
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,430
- Don't forget our arrangement.
- Oh!

80
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,300
Oh, I'm sorry. Don't know what I'm doing,
you know? Just all...

81
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,750
I really didn't mean to. OK? OK. Bye-bye.

82
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,480
- What's the matter, Ralph?
- Guys, Sue can't come.

83
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,270
- No.
- Yeah.

84
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,900
Something went wrong
with one of her exams,

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,650
and she's just gonna
have to take it over again.

86
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,000
- Oh, God.
- That's terrible.

87
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,340
- Yeah...
- Get in. You can't let that spoil your trip.

88
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,280
- Where are you going?
- I'm just going in to say goodbye.

89
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,170
Hey, no, guys, I really
wouldn't feel right going without Sue.

90
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,210
- Don't be a jerk.
- Get in the car.

91
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,170
You're going. No backing out now.

92
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,710
- No...
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

93
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,340
Hey, there's Sue.

94
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,340
Hi, guys. Sorry to keep you waiting.

95
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,510
Hi, Sue.

96
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm really sorry you can't go.

97
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,340
- Yeah, me too.
- Rotten luck.

98
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,190
What're you guys talking about?

99
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,350
- Ralph!
- Ooh! Oh, man!

100
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,450
What a jerk.

101
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,730
God, I believe him
every time, all the time.

102
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,060
- Guys, gimme a break.
- Aw, Ralph.

103
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,660
Besides, let's get this road trip...

104
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,900
- ...on the road!
- Break my car.

105
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,760
That's OK, it's paid for.

106
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Come on.

107
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,740
Man, this car's not convinced
we're going anywhere.

108
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,770
So, my philosophy is,
let's have some beer.

109
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,380
<i>When the leaves of summer
turn to red and gold</i>

110
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,720
<i>And the football games bring
a hint of the cold</i>

111
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,490
<i>Time to get away</i>

112
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,560
<i>We'll pack the car with escape in mind</i>

113
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,860
<i>Forgettin' about classes,
leavin' books behind</i>

114
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,170
<i>Time to get away</i>

115
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,990
<i>Empty cootage sittin' on the shore</i>

116
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,870
<i>Tourists all left about a month before</i>

117
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,950
<i>And we're gonna have a good time</i>

118
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,370
<i>Gonna have a good time</i>

119
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,160
<i>Yeah, we're gonna have a good time</i>

120
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,410
<i>We're goin' on a...</i>

121
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,580
<i>A fall break</i>

122
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,460
<i>Walkin' hand in hand in the moonlight</i>

123
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,040
<i>In the moonlight</i>

124
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,880
<i>We'll breathe the sweet salt air</i>

125
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,150
<i>I swear we're never far</i>

126
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,550
<i>We're goin' on a...</i>

127
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,930
<i>A fall break</i>

128
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,220
<i>Runnin' in the sand feelin' all right</i>

129
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,390
<i>Feelin' all right</i>

130
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,890
<i>And when you fall into my arms</i>

131
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,910
<i>I'll break into your heart</i>

132
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,570
Oh, man.

133
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,570
Well, I think I'll go get some beer.

134
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,030
Will that be all?

135
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,280
Maybe.

136
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,200
Hey, how old do you
have to be to get that discount?

137
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,500
- 65.
- 65?

138
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,500
Hey, man, now that's discrimination.

139
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,500
- It is?
- It sure is.

140
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,170
Look, I'm a law student,
so I ought to know.

141
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,510
That discriminates against me
for being young.

142
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,480
- It does?
- Well, sure it does.

143
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,590
Look, tell you what I'm gonna do.

144
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,840
If you'll give me that 10% discount,

145
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,760
I'll go get another six-pack of beer,
and we'll both benefit.

146
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,470
Now, what do you say to that?

147
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,570
Sure.

148
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,400
What took you so long?

149
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,530
Oh, man, wait till you guys
hear about this one.

150
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,990
This is great.

151
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:39,040
- They're always great...
- Oh, man.

152
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,210
Another one of those
smart ass college kids,

153
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,310
talking themselves into buying
two six-packs instead of one.

154
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,140
Yep.

155
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,840
<i>I can hardly wait to head for the dunes</i>

156
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,470
<i>Spread down a blanket</i>

157
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,570
<i>Humming sweet love tunes from yesteryear</i>

158
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,560
<i>Not a soul in sight,
girl, ahead and blessed</i>

159
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,560
<i>Bring a radio, a cooler,
and a case of the best</i>

160
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
<i>And we'll disappear</i>

161
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,570
<i>And later on maybe who knows</i>

162
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,530
<i>We'll swim in the surf
in our birthday clothes</i>

163
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,570
<i>And we're gonna have a good time</i>

164
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,870
<i>Gonna have a good time</i>

165
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,580
<i>Yeah, we're gonna have a good time</i>

166
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,700
<i>We're goin' on a...</i>

167
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,870
<i>A fall break</i>

168
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,290
<i>Walkin' hand in hand in the moonlight</i>

169
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,580
<i>In the moonlight</i>

170
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,590
<i>We'll breathe the sweet salt air</i>

171
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,900
<i>I swear we're never far</i>

172
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,720
<i>We're goin' on a...</i>

173
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,880
<i>A fall break</i>

174
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,470
<i>Runnin' in the sand feelin' all right</i>

175
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,600
<i>Feelin' all right</i>

176
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,020
<i>And when you fall into my arms</i>

177
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,160
<i>I'll break into your heart</i>

178
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,730
<i>We're gonna have a good time</i>

179
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,380
<i>A fall break</i>

180
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,760
<i>A fall break, a fall break
Ooh</i>

181
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,010
<i>A fall break</i>

182
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,890
<i>A fall break, a fall break
Hey, hey, hey, a fall break</i>

183
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,470
<i>A fall break, a fall break</i>

184
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,970
<i>Ooh, a fall break</i>

185
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,640
<i>A fall break, a fall break</i>

186
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,410
<i>Yeah, fall break</i>

187
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,570
So, this is it, huh?

188
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,510
The famous condo at the beach.

189
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,570
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

190
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,840
- Nah, it's not too bad.
- I kinda like it.

191
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,200
All right, everybody,
let's get this stuff inside.

192
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,260
Hey, Pam. Throw me the keys.

193
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,940
Ooh, easy.

194
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,390
Hey, Ralph. Catch!

195
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,300
Hey, Ed. I don't need 'em.

196
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,770
This place is wide open.

197
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,590
- So, what's the hold up?
- Yeah.

198
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,730
I don't know.

199
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,410
Something just doesn't look right.

200
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,810
It's nothing. Just a little mess.

201
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,910
Come on in.

202
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,750
Looks like we missed the party.

203
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,990
I see my dad had a little help
bringing on his spell.

204
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,540
What do you mean?

205
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,910
Well, he likes to come down
with his drinking buddies

206
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,710
and they swap lies about
the good old days when they were

207
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,710
great white hunters and macho men.

208
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,150
Macho, huh?

209
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,770
Yeah.

210
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,490
Dad used to tell me that he'd
hunted everything but man.

211
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,520
How long do you think
it's been since they were here?

212
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,450
I don't know. Last week,
last night, this morning maybe.

213
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,650
I think we should call the cops.

214
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,440
What if this place has been broken into?

215
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,110
Yeah, what if they're still here?

216
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,400
Cut it out, Ralph.

217
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,690
Besides, there are no cops.

218
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,780
No cops?

219
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,740
Well, the cops on the mainland,
the Sheriff's Department?

220
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,240
And they come over and patrol
like that guy on the bridge.

221
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,750
There's almost always someone
on the beach patrolling though.

222
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,573
Almost always?

223
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:15,040
- Great place to smuggle dope.
- I think we should report it.

224
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,750
Yeah, how can you be sure
it's your old man?

225
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,460
Look, nothing's missing.

226
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,340
Let's just don't worry about it.

227
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,720
Avoid the hassle.

228
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,860
Hey, guys. Look at this stuff.

229
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,770
Geez! Would you look at all this shit?

230
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,580
Well, rah, rah.

231
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,870
Look at this.

232
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,670
That was a record.

233
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,340
28 pounds.

234
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Mmm-mmm, I'll bet that was
good baked with a little lemon.

235
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,720
Oh, Dad didn't eat it.

236
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,850
He's what's called a trophy hunter.

237
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,710
Well, looks like the party's over
for this joker.

238
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,890
Ugh.

239
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,890
Yeah... My dad ran over him
with a ski boat.

240
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,480
An accident.

241
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,830
What's this thing?

242
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,360
Uh, that's a gaff.

243
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,700
What's a gaff?

244
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,660
When you're fishing, and you see a big
one up over the side of the boat,

245
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,600
then you hook it in him.

246
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,220
- Here.
- Real nice.

247
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,360
I guess this is what he
caught that fish with.

248
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,860
Nope. It's what he caught this girl with.

249
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,090
How did you know it was a girl?

250
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,260
Yeah.

251
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,850
When he caught her,

252
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,350
he slit her open and a couple of dozen
little baby sharks spilled out on the deck,

253
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,330
all flipping around with
the yolk sacks still attached.

254
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,750
Oh, yuck.

255
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,030
- You're sick.
- Nice.

256
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,740
Tell us about this.

257
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,590
This one's great.

258
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,700
One night, Big Ed, I mean Dad,

259
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,460
and his buddies were all
over here having a drinking party,

260
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,140
and they decided to have a contest.

261
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,280
"Hey, let's throw pyramid sinkers
through the wall."

262
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,880
You know, they almost made it.

263
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,880
Well, Dad won the contest, naturally,

264
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,480
and this was his winning toss.

265
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,869
He was so proud, he nailed
a picture frame around it.

266
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,540
- Where are the bedrooms?
- Give us a break.

267
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,580
Upstairs.

268
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,930
Watch it, you're going to drop it.

269
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Don't tell us.

270
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,790
Your dad won the Halloween costume
contest at the Moose Lodge.

271
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600
No, wait.

272
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,030
That is a mask
of the Mayan rain god, Chaac.

273
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,880
Dad picked it up
on a hunting trip in Yucatan.

274
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,170
I think he stole it.

275
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,540
You know, the priests were supposed
to wear these during ritual sacrifices.

276
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,050
Sacrifices?

277
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,800
Sacrifices.

278
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,960
Tell me they sacrificed lambs
and little things like that?

279
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,960
Yeah, little things like that.

280
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,390
No, big things like girls.

281
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,060
The victims, young virgins,

282
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,610
were shot with arrows,

283
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,090
or sometimes beheaded.

284
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,725
Ugh, take this away from me.

285
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,700
Virgins, huh?

286
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,980
Well, at least we're all safe...

287
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,070
Or are we?

288
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,040
Jerk.

289
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,460
What went there?

290
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,990
Ah, one of my dad's favourite things.
His battle-axe.

291
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,990
- It's not there now.
- No shit.

292
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,490
It's missing.

293
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,040
He probablyjust took it with him.

294
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,120
How can you be sure? Maybe it was stolen.

295
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,630
Sometimes he takes his toys
home for a while.

296
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,300
- Well, I'm a little uncomfortable.
- Christ, who would want it.

297
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,210
And why would they take
just the battle-axe?

298
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,150
Yeah, why not that fantastic mask?

299
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,010
Well, I don't know.

300
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,110
But I'd feel a lot better
if you'd report it to the police.

301
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,120
OK, I'll tell you what.

302
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,000
We'll find a phone in the morning,
and I'll call my dad.

303
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,900
If he says he doesn't have the battle-axe,

304
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,360
then we'll call the
Sheriff's Department on the mainland

305
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,010
and report that the house has been
broken into, and something stolen.

306
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,550
OK?

307
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,130
OK.

308
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,740
OK, now let's get that stuff upstairs.

309
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,130
All right. Sounds like a good idea to me.

310
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,060
Oh...

311
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Uh...

312
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,320
Hey, Ralph, want to help carry
some of these things up?

313
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,070
They might get lost upstairs.

314
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,590
It's still a little early.

315
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,370
Hey, Pam, that's a great idea.

316
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,180
Uh, need any help lighting your fire?

317
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,430
Oh!

318
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,380
Here's your room.
Why don't you give me those?

319
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,020
No sooner said than done.

320
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,270
It's a nice change, isn't it?

321
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,660
Mmm-hmm.

322
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,670
Yeah.

323
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,470
Ah, it feels good. Come here.

324
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

325
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,260
What do you suppose is in here?

326
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,750
- Trophies, of course, what else?
- Yeah, I wonder where he keeps them.

327
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,310
Hey, maybe this is where
he keeps the mask of the sun god, Zeus.

328
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,520
Yeah, maybe this is where he keeps
the mask of the moon god, goose!

329
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,330
Oh! Whoa!

330
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,790
Geez, that scared the shit out of me.

331
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,580
What do you suppose these are for?

332
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,100
To hold the net up.

333
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,750
Wouldn't think they'd have
to be so sharp, would you?

334
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,020
I don't know.

335
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,280
How do I look as a fisherman?

336
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,270
Not bad. But your rubbers are too big.

337
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,750
That's the first time
you've ever said that.

338
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,500
Here, catch.

339
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,790
Think you could throw
that through the wall?

340
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,630
Geez, I don't know, but I sure would hate
to get hit in the head with one of these.

341
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,510
Or anywhere else.

342
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,390
Hey, look at this a minute.

343
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,010
You don't think this is what ran over
that sucker upstairs, do you?

344
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,050
No, it's too small for a ski boat.

345
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Yeah, too small for a ski boat.

346
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,280
Now, how about these?

347
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
I know what these are for.

348
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,710
Come here.

349
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,290
Linda!

350
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,410
- Yes?
- How about a little help up here?

351
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,760
On the way.

352
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,400
- Go on up, I'm right behind you.
- All right.

353
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,410
- That wasn't too bad.
- That was.

354
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,170
- Say excuse me.
- Man...

355
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,520
I've had about enough.

356
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,460
Let's get this mess cleaned up.

357
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

358
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,380
Here's a duty roster.

359
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
A duty roster?

360
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,590
Yep, Ed and I clean up tonight.

361
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,030
Ralph and Sue tomorrow night, and so on.

362
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,570
Come on, sweet meats,
let's go enjoy our night off.

363
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,190
Come on, this is too much.

364
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,520
Let's walk off some of that food.

365
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,470
Come on, you guys,
let's go for a walk on the beach.

366
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,570
Uh, you guys go ahead.

367
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,470
We'll catch up to you later?

368
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,570
Right.

369
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,380
One, two, three, four, five, six.

370
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,630
I wonder where Mike and Linda are.

371
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,230
They're out on the beach.

372
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,040
They've been gone a long time.

373
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,650
Now, where did I put those arrows?

374
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,650
Cut it out, Ralph.

375
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,470
No sacrifices tonight.

376
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,570
Eh!

377
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,930
What are you so happy about, anyhow?

378
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,560
You've done something.
I recognize that grin.

379
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,520
Oh, you'll see.

380
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,730
Done something cute to Mike and Linda.

381
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,690
Quit that sort of thing, Ralph.

382
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,710
Yeah, when are you gonna grow up?

383
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,990
I don't know.

384
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,840
Look, hey, let's take a break
from this game.

385
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,700
It's so easy, it is boring.

386
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,260
- Easy? You're losing.
- Um, small point.

387
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,060
I'm ready for a break.

388
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,410
Suits me. I'm broke, anyhow.

389
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,360
Let's catch up with Mike and Linda.

390
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,600
Hey, guys!

391
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,700
Mike!

392
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Linda!

393
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,630
- Come on.
- Where?

394
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,140
To the pool, dummy.

395
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,030
Linda, where are you?

396
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,240
What's wrong with the water?

397
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,660
It looks like it's been
loaded down with chlorine.

398
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,450
Will that hurt you?

399
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,890
No, in fact it probably prevents herpes.

400
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,630
Oh? I didn't know I had to be
concerned about that.

401
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,621
You, in the pool.

402
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:35,580
Hey, where did everybody go?

403
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,850
This is great.

404
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,480
Yeah.

405
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,650
In the pool.

406
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,650
That's sweet.

407
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,100
Thank you.

408
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,810
Does this mean that if we don't make love,
you'll still like me in the morning?

409
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:56,240
It means, if we don't make love,
I'll still like you tonight.

410
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,240
We'll just have to let the morning
see what the morning brings.

411
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,520
Oh, heavy.

412
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,830
Hey, where did everybody go?

413
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,630
There's a slow echo in here.

414
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,770
Stay here. I'll get it.

415
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,950
Tag. You're it.

416
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,450
Bet you can't find me.

417
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,780
Mmm.

418
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,420
Ah, this feels good.

419
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,160
Mmm.

420
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,070
Shit!

421
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,730
Thank God for small favours.

422
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,110
What's this?

423
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,120
A little game, eh?

424
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,340
Gotcha!

425
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,140
Socks, nice.

426
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,150
What I really want is my... jacket!

427
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,860
Say, you're pretty good at this.

428
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,540
Thanks.

429
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,190
Now this is getting interesting.

430
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,200
I think I'm getting your message.

431
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,180
Geez, not again!

432
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,860
I'm coming...

433
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,450
To get you...

434
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,220
- Do you see 'em?
- I thought I saw something.

435
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,710
Mike!

436
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,650
- Do you see them?
- Pam saw something.

437
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,800
Is everything all right here?

438
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah.

439
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,260
You just scared me, that's all.

440
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,930
What are you kids doing out here
at night on the beach, anyway?

441
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,950
We're staying at my
father's condo, up that way.

442
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,370
Right here along the street,
the one that runs on the ocean.

443
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,680
Yeah, he was closing his condo
for the winter when he became ill,

444
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,850
and we all came down to help finish up.

445
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,950
It's the only one around
here with any lights on.

446
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,460
I saw some men around there yesterday.

447
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,610
But their car was gone.

448
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,320
I didn't see anyone there today.

449
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,280
Well, somebody was there today.

450
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,380
When we came, the door was open
and one of his father's things was missing.

451
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,340
Is that right?

452
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,010
Yeah, but I'm sure my father
just took it home with him.

453
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,330
Look, I'm gonna give him a call
in the morning and if it's not right,

454
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,710
I'll report it.

455
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,400
All right, I've noted it.

456
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,470
And I'm not gonna make it
official until you call it in.

457
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,550
OK.

458
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:10,550
In the meantime, you kids be careful
out here on the beach tonight.

459
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,230
It's not dangerous, is it?

460
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,310
Yeah, there's no murderers
or rapers around, are there?

461
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,410
I mean, have you been
having some heavy action lately?

462
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,630
Are you kiddin'?
It's like a graveyard around here.

463
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,250
There's some thunderstorms coming through.

464
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,410
You could get struck by lightning
walking on the beach at night.

465
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,340
OK, thanks for the warning.

466
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,760
Say, you didn't happen to see another
couple walking on the beach, did you?

467
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,290
No, I'm sorry.

468
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,440
Well, if you do see them, don't look.

469
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,920
OK, thanks.

470
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,390
Say, how do you suppose
he could sneak up behind somebody

471
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,350
wearing all of that hardware?

472
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,450
Practice.

473
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,900
Let me go! Let me go!

474
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,260
Mike!

475
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,020
Yeah, I'm investigating a possible 10-38

476
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,880
at 4 East Ocean Townes.

477
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,760
Roger, Ben. We know where you are.

478
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,860
10-4.

479
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,370
Well, anybody up for a footrace?

480
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,530
- Me too.
- Let's head back.

481
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,110
Lightning is not one
of my favourite things.

482
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,860
Yeah, that's a good idea.

483
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,630
Oh, look. What's this?

484
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,000
That's a skate's egg, sometimes
called the devil's pocketbook.

485
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,420
Uh, they're said to attract lightning?

486
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,770
- Right, Ralph.
- Mmm...

487
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,140
No! No!

488
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,590
You find many good seashells along here?

489
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,470
Oh, yeah, at this time of year when
there's not too many people around,

490
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,280
shell-hunting ought to be pretty good.

491
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,280
Let's go look for seashells
in the morning.

492
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,580
Sure.

493
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,560
Let's hurry up and finish the game.
It's almost bedtime.

494
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,360
You have a one-track mind.

495
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,570
- I do not. I have a two-track mind.
- Oh, yeah, what's the other one on?

496
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,280
Well, right now it's on sex, too,
but not always.

497
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,410
- I'll bet.
- Uh, you're not complaining, are you?

498
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:41,490
Well, no.

499
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,870
Right...

500
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,370
I wish Ralph wouldn't have so much
to say about my being a virgin.

501
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,580
Ah, he's trying to help me score.

502
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,630
Score? Is that all
we are to you three? Scores?

503
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,550
You know better than that.

504
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,020
But to Ralph, it's a necessary
part of a relationship.

505
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,590
Well, it's not a necessary
part of my relationships.

506
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,700
- I know.
- What's that supposed to mean?

507
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,240
Well, Ralph, are you
ready to file for bankruptcy,

508
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,870
or would you like to try to drag
it out just a little bit longer?

509
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,620
Why don't you guys save
the rest of that game till tomorrow?

510
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,620
Come on, let's do
something all of us can play.

511
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,270
What'd you have in mind?

512
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,560
Nothing in particular.

513
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,707
Anybody got any ideas?

514
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,735
It's getting close to bedtime, isn't it?

515
00:47:38,837 --> 00:47:40,740
Not yet, tiger.

516
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,200
"Not yet, tiger."

517
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,940
No more. I've had enough.

518
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,210
Enough? You haven't had any... Ow!

519
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,760
She'll do it, too, Ralph.

520
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,660
Hey, I've got a great idea.
How about a game of Blind Man's Bluff?

521
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,660
All right. I'll get the beers.

522
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,350
No, I'll... I'll get 'em.

523
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:11,850
Please?

524
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,045
Pam was gonna give you a fat lip,
which you really did deserve.

525
00:48:30,145 --> 00:48:33,660
- Nah, she wasn't going to do anything.
- Bullshit.

526
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,690
Blind Man's Bluff?

527
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,740
I don't believe it. We're going
to grope around in the dark?

528
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,660
Would you rather grope in the light?

529
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,010
Get serious.

530
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,370
First, everybody gets a beer.

531
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,680
That's the important part.

532
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,810
Then, we turn off all the lights.

533
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,590
Whoever is "it" stays in the house,

534
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,020
and the rest of us go outside
and drink a beer.

535
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,670
Then, the person playing it hides himself,

536
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,930
and we all come back in
and try to find him.

537
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,470
When we do,

538
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,490
we stand, or sit, or lie down next to him.

539
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,490
Finally,

540
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,730
there'll just be one person
wandering around the house,

541
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,030
trying to find everybody else.

542
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,450
Sounds like great fun.

543
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,630
You'll see. You'll see.

544
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,370
OK. Now, who's gonna be it?

545
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,750
Me. I'm gonna be it.

546
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,000
All right.

547
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,770
Everybody else, out!

548
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,160
Come on up.

549
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:07,409
Let me down, let me down.

550
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,540
Oh, the poor little thing.

551
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,290
Sorry, Ralph, you'll have to go around
and play fair, just like everybody else.

552
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,351
Here we come, ready or not.

553
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,840
Think she's had enough time?

554
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,940
Yeah.

555
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,800
Any of you guys want a beer?

556
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,270
Yeah, I'll take one.

557
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,860
- Yeah, me too.
- Me too.

558
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,270
How did you know we were here?

559
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,110
Ha! It was the process of elimination.

560
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,860
He'd already looked everywhere else.

561
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,460
That's right.

562
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,210
OK, what's next?

563
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,350
I get it.

564
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,770
You know, I'm really
worried about Mike and Linda.

565
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,520
They've been gone so long.

566
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,270
Hey, don't worry about Mike and Linda.

567
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,440
They're just having a good time
enjoying each other's company.

568
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,150
You know, it has been a pretty
long week for all of us

569
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,340
and they're just relaxing. OK?

570
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,260
- All right.
- All right. Come on.

571
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,560
- Good night.
- Good night.

572
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,280
Hi.

573
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:47,810
You know, Ralph isn't
such a bad guy after all.

574
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,220
I know. Told you so.

575
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,860
I know. It's just that... Uh-uh.

576
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,190
We have a deal, buddy,
and I'm holding you to it.

577
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,480
Ah, come on...

578
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,580
Now, look...

579
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:03,200
You know how I feel about you,
and I want to.

580
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,300
I really do, you know that.

581
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,220
But I'm just not going to.

582
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,220
Some other time, maybe,

583
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,340
but not here, and not now.

584
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:21,300
I was thinking that maybe the atmosphere
of this place would loosen you up a little.

585
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,030
Shit.

586
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,360
Ralph, do you know what we forgot?

587
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,602
Wait a minute, I think
I've got one in my pack.

588
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:18,910
No, dummy, we forgot
to lock up for the night.

589
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:23,900
Lock up?
We're the only people on this island.

590
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,210
Come on.

591
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,030
Well, what about Mike and Linda?

592
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,160
They're still outside, you know.

593
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,390
Well, maybe you should
go and try to find them.

594
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,600
At least make sure they're all right?

595
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,120
And, uh, I've got something
to show you when you get back.

596
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,140
Oh, Lord, goodness gracious.

597
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,410
Oh, the kitchen door's already
locked, as if you didn't know.

598
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,190
Yes?

599
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,310
If you hear anyone
wandering around downstairs,

600
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,210
don't shoot, it's just me.
Going down to lock up.

601
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,320
Why are you gonna lock up?
There's no one on the island except us.

602
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,210
Oh, well, you know.

603
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,160
What about Mike and Linda?
How will they get in?

604
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,120
Well, I'm going down to find them and
tell them the fort's closing for the night.

605
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,260
If they want to come in, now is the time.

606
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,330
Be careful.

607
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,260
Well, I certainly will.

608
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,050
"Do you know what we forgot to do, Ralph?

609
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,570
"We forgot to lock up."

610
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:39,690
Man, if that ain't bad enough,
then I have to open up my big mouth.

611
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,500
"Yeah, what about Mike and Linda?"

612
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,080
"What about Mike and Linda, Ralph?"

613
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:25,920
Mike!

614
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,590
Linda!

615
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:33,212
Now, where would I be?

616
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,500
Upstairs in bed. That's where I'd be.

617
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,000
Mike?

618
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,330
Linda?

619
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,090
Shit...

620
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,870
Why am I whispering?

621
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:26,880
There's absolutely no one
else on this island but us.

622
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,960
Hey, Mike, you and Linda come on out now.

623
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,560
We need to lock up so we can go to bed.

624
01:01:33,974 --> 01:01:36,240
Look, come on out.

625
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:41,180
Hey, I'm sorry for all those tricks
I've ever played on you, and I promise,

626
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,910
hey, I promise I'll never play
any more tricks.

627
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:15,680
Well, no wonder.

628
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,970
Whoo-hoo!

629
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,610
Fallen asleep, huh?

630
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,030
All right!

631
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,230
Ta-da!

632
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,550
Not yet, huh?

633
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,740
Look, I gotta lock up,
cos I got something to see upstairs.

634
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,560
Oh, boy.

635
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,870
Oh, guys, I'm really going
to hate to do this,

636
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,670
but I've got to make sure
you're OK for the night.

637
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:25,600
No.

638
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,560
Even I couldn't do that.

639
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,700
Ed...

640
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,120
Ed?

641
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,750
Did you hear something?

642
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,040
Ralph?

643
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,010
Ed. Ed.

644
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,900
Goddamn you, Ralph.

645
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,120
Ed. Ed. Wake up.

646
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:39,930
- What? What's the matter?
- Shh! Listen. Something is wrong.

647
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,040
What, what is it?

648
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,840
All of the kids are missing.

649
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:44,840
What?

650
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,320
Mike and Linda's bed has never been
slept in, and Sue and Ralph are gone.

651
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,260
- We're alone.
- They're just playing a game or something.

652
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,850
- Get up and help me look for the others.
- Leave me alone.

653
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:55,680
You've got to get up and help me!

654
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,160
All right. All right.

655
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,250
Not sleeping together is one thing,

656
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:05,250
not sleeping at all is something else.

657
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,780
See?

658
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,990
Ralph.

659
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,680
- Come on.
- Hmm.

660
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
See?

661
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,020
Ralph?

662
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,040
Where have you been? Where are the others?

663
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,460
I don't know. I'm scared.
Something's wrong.

664
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,380
Girls, just calm down.

665
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,130
No, Mike and Linda have never come back.

666
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,800
Ralph went to go look for them,
and now he's gone, too. Help me find him.

667
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,140
- All right. All right.
- We'll find him.

668
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,410
Yeah, we'll look around down here.

669
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,520
- You go upstairs and get dressed.
- OK.

670
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,650
There aren't many places
to hide around here.

671
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:26,870
Yeah...

672
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,780
- Here, put this on.
- What for?

673
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,320
- We're leaving.
- Oh...

674
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,340
- Hurry up, Sue.
- Coming.

675
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,930
Hurry up, Sue!

676
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,420
We can't leave without Ralph.

677
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,650
Oh, yes, we can. Come on.

678
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,220
I'm not leaving without Ralph.

679
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,260
Just to drive over to the
Sheriff's Department on the mainland.

680
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,590
- We'll be right back with help.
- I'm not leaving.

681
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,890
- You've got to come.
- Let's take one last look around.

682
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,950
- We'll be right back.
- One last look?

683
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,450
One last look?

684
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,730
All right.

685
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:09,440
OK, you two go around
that side and I'll go this way.

686
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,940
Uh-uh, buddy, I'm sticking with you.

687
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,070
Why don't you two go around this side,
and I'll go around that side?

688
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,010
- Make it fast.
- OK.

689
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,590
Ralph?

690
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,613
Sue?

691
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:06,242
Sue?

692
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,700
Oh, God! Oh, God,
Ed, cover it up, cover it up!

693
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,050
OK, OK.

694
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,980
Oh, God!

695
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,480
We've got to get out of here.

696
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,120
- No, no! Let me out of here!
- Shh!

697
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,260
Let me out of here!

698
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,190
Just stop! Leave him alone!

699
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,820
No!

700
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:30,620
Stop!

701
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,900
Pam! Get me out of this.

702
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,670
Get me out of this!

703
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,240
Come on.

704
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:22,960
Let's get out of here.

705
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:45,390
- You're gonna have to drive.
- OK. OK. Come on.

706
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,940
You think he's dead?

707
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,770
Hell, yes, he's dead. They're all dead.

708
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,190
I can't believe it.

709
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,830
Give me the keys.

710
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:20,010
Pick it up.

711
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,090
- How bad are you hurt?
- Pretty bad. I've got to get to a doctor.

712
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,380
I'm feeling funny.

713
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,880
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Let's just get out of here.

714
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,110
OK.

715
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,350
Aw, come on!

716
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:41,770
- Quit pumping the gas!
- Now what?

717
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,370
Great, it's flooded!

718
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,500
Just give it a few seconds.

719
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,740
Don't you have a handkerchief
or something?

720
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,710
Yeah.

721
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,550
- Here, let me have your belt.
- OK.

722
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,570
Thanks.

723
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,240
Why don't we turn off
the headlights? It'll save the battery.

724
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,740
- Ed...
- Yeah?

725
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,310
Look!

726
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:31,400
Ahh. Come on. Come on!

727
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,380
Oh, come on!

728
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,180
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

729
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:44,580
Pam, start the car!
For Christ's sake, start the car!

730
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,060
I'm trying!

731
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:51,980
We're gonna die, we're gonna die.

732
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,190
Oh, God! No!

733
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,450
Look out! Stop. Get your hands off him!

734
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:14,620
Come out, you son of a bitch! Come on!

735
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,620
I'll get it! I'll get it!

736
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,430
Look. Look!

737
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,450
Help! Help!

738
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,830
Look. Look. Look.

739
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,610
Help!

740
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:57,710
No!

741
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:04,180
No!

742
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,690
Jesus Christ.

743
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,400
That's my dad...

744
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:30,860
Pull forward!

745
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,350
Watch out!

746
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,410
Dr Ferrell, Dr Cooper, Dr Winborne,

01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:26,090

748
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,670
How is she?

749
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,310
About the same.

750
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:57,660
Hi

751
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:17,670
<i>When the leaves of summer
turn to red and gold</i>

752
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:20,840
<i>And the football games bring
a hint of the cold</i>

753
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:23,690
<i>Time to get away</i>

754
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:27,970
<i>We'll pack the car with escape in mind</i>

755
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:31,060
<i>Forgettin' about classes,
leavin' books behind</i>

756
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,830
<i>Time to get away</i>

757
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:38,190
<i>Empty cootage sittin' on the shore</i>

758
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:41,150
<i>Tourists all left about a month before</i>

759
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,230
<i>And we're gonna have a good time</i>

760
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,530
<i>Gonna have a good time</i>

761
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,360
<i>Yeah, we're gonna have a good time</i>

762
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,740
<i>We're goin' on a...</i>

763
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,280
<i>A fall break</i>

764
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,080
<i>Walkin' hand in hand in the moonlight</i>

765
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,250
<i>In the moonlight</i>

766
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:56,620
<i>We'll breathe the sweet salt air</i>

767
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,510
<i>I swear we're never far</i>

768
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:01,750
<i>We're goin' on a...</i>

769
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,840
<i>A fall break</i>

770
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:06,510
<i>Runnin' in the sand feelin' all right</i>

771
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:07,680
<i>Feelin' all right</i>

772
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:10,180
<i>And when you fall into my arms</i>

773
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,330
<i>I'll break into your heart</i>
