1
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,738
One evening in November ...

2
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:39,155
- Wait. Be careful!
- Yes.

3
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,087
The security guard will pull
down the gate in 5 minutes.

4
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:52,569
Look! They are leaving...

5
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:24,355
- Betty! Betty!
- Bob!

6
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,828
Come over here, quick!
Take the car-jack.

7
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,881
Shit, I didn't know about this.

8
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:53,003
- Goddamnit.
- Come on... let's go!

9
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,302
Stop the car! Stop!

10
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,184
Are you crazy? You gonna kill him!

11
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,543
Betty... Betty, what's wrong with you...

12
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:28,483
There's another one, let's have a look at him.

13
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:33,824
It's Fletcher. I'm afraid he's dead.

14
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:50,299
THE ROADHOUSE OF THE VIOLENT DOLLS

15
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:32,350
After she was sentenced to 10 years in jail
for robbery with death of a policeman,...

16
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:38,289
...Betty Williams was transfered to the
women's prison in Balmoral in January.

17
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,195
Already the first months in
this evil and terrible environment...

18
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:44,766
...turned her into a tough,
withdrawn and embittered person.

19
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:48,243
There were still no leads of the
whereabouts of her lover and accomplice.

20
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:52,521
That's how it seemed at
least, until one day in spring...

21
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:53,540
Attention!

22
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,838
- Come on, hurry!
- Keep your mouth shut.

23
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,120
Don't you want to know
why you are being transferred?

24
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,032
I stopped asking questions.

25
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,912
You are becoming more reasonable.
You can get some facilitations for that.

26
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:13,119
The C Block is our 'high-end area'.
No solitary confinement.

27
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,858
I'd prefer to not get beaten up.

28
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:18,690
That totally depends on you.
We can't treat you like a raw egg.

29
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,287
One can get along with me.

30
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:27,409
Your new 'apartment'.

31
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:36,344
This is lady Esther and princess Sylvia.
They belong to the high nobility of shoplifters.

32
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:41,527
Get along well, girls! Don't let them ruin you.

33
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,637
My name is Betty Williams.

34
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:53,408
- Is this luxury couch available?
- Yes.

35
00:05:56,611 --> 00:06:02,929
We have heard about you.
10 years, that's a lot.

36
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,235
I have to do 3.5 years.
We are repeat offenders, you know.

37
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:11,054
It's my first time in jail. I wanted to rob some
jewelry with a friend of mine and disappear.

38
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,844
And we wanted to get married
and buy a shop in Rio de Janeiro.

39
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:17,877
They guy has stood you up, huh.
They have never caught him.

40
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,772
Should he get himself caught then?

41
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:23,191
He would have got life for killing the policeman.

42
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:25,972
- There is nothing else he could've done.
- What? That's what I call love.

43
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,381
And now he is in Rio without you.

44
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:31,249
- And in Rio he is grabbing someone else's ass.
- You...

45
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,694
What do you want, huh?
Don't get all upset.

46
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:41,513
What do you know? My Bob is not in Rio!

47
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:45,148
We are no longer interested in
gentleman stories anyways.

48
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:48,304
If we would think about men in
here as well one would go crazy.

49
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,983
- Am I right, darling?
- Yes, for real.

50
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,577
Huh, so that's how it goes.

51
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:59,275
Yes. If you are nice to us
you might have some chances.

52
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:03,411
- Not with me. I'm totally normal!
- Oh, how original.

53
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:07,926
I don't deserve to be in here one minute.

54
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,611
I told you a thousand times that I'm
innocent and how everything happened.

55
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:14,445
Oh, of course. We are all innocent in here!

56
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:18,071
You didn't sell any cocaine. The others
over there didn't steal anything...

57
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,384
...and my child drowned
by accident in the canal.

58
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,532
You are disgusting!

59
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,024
- And who else complained about me?
- No one. You know that everyone is afraid.

60
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:35,376
But if another report goes to the
Ministery you will be into trouble.

61
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:37,578
Sometimes you beat them pretty bad.

62
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,148
I manage a prison and not a hospital.

63
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,304
You know that excessive punishment
corrupts them even more.

64
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:46,865
As long as we have to lump
together hookers, thieves,...

65
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,619
...killers and notorious criminals
there's nothing we can do.

66
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,587
They all corrupt themselves without our doings.

67
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:54,571
But sometimes we can help them.

68
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:57,793
Bullshit. Who becomes a prison ward, huh?

69
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:01,391
There are only a handful of trained prison wardens.

70
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:08,860
Superintendent Nipple. What?

71
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,020
Take all three to the watch point.
I'll pick them up myself.

72
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:12,830
What happened?

73
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,707
Three of the new ones were caught at the main gate.
The stupid cows were hiding inside the trash cans.

74
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,714
This hasn't happened in ages.

75
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:23,060
Yes. And we will make sure that it
won't happen again for a long time.

76
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,233
Let's hurry up girls!

77
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:42,715
- The others have to get in here, too!
- Same thing every morning...

78
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:55,836
- Stop it!
- Open your mouth

79
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,993
- I like to hear you sing so much.
- Watch it, you stupid bitch.

80
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:02,395
- What's going on here?
- Dirty dog! - Jane!

81
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,169
And you?

82
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:12,268
- What is this?
- It's my fault. I slipped.

83
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,184
How clumsy...

84
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,635
Beat it!

85
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:24,639
... lied to and cheated.
He had killed his father if he had come...

86
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,378
...I didn't want it ...it just happened
...I don't even know...

87
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:33,428
You can go and ask them. I don't want
to leave. They will forget about me...

88
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,109
I have to get out of here and
see him. It doesn't matter how.

89
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,471
Keep quiet. You've gone crazy
since I told you where Bob is.

90
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:45,940
- Did you see him again?
- No. It's a long way from here.

91
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:51,584
- If me and John hadn't happened to just pass by...
- And you really think that he didn't recognize you?

92
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:55,654
I didn't say anything to him, because of John.

93
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:57,920
He didn't even pay me any attention.

94
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:01,463
I told you that he has changed a lot.
He calls himself "Hill" or something.

95
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:06,755
Maybe I'm wrong. But the big scar on his hand...

96
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:11,111
That's from the robbery, definitely.
The area makes sense, too.

97
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:14,054
He knows his way around
up there from the time...

98
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,846
Listen Judith, you have to help me.

99
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:19,358
I don't want to get
sucked into this, understand!

100
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,596
John and me want to get married this year.

101
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:25,664
Shall I write him a letter about
you being an ex-prostitute?

102
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:27,738
What do you want from me?

103
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:32,774
Are you still the last person to
leave the department store?

104
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:35,418
Let the delivery entrance
unlocked over the weekend.

105
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,653
Visiting time is over!

106
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:44,718
Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

107
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,993
Hurry, hurry! Faster!

108
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:13,688
Make yourself comfortable.
Or are you afraid?

109
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:22,274
Pour us a drink. The scotch is great.

110
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,593
There you go. I dont like it if
someone is just messing around.

111
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:37,950
We are all grown-ups. Why all this foreplay?

112
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,014
I've liked you for a while.

113
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,359
- Forget about any stupid ideas.
- You bitch!

114
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:20,553
Keep quiet! I'm getting out of here.

115
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:22,874
- How did you get hold of the keys?
- If you do what I say I'll help you.

116
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,888
Isn't this the coat from Nipple?

117
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,461
I hit her over the head.
She will be sleeping for a while.

118
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:28,802
They gonna catch us in no time.

119
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:31,887
It's all planned out. We'll get new
clothes and a car at a department store.

120
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,258
Then we drive up to the Highlands.

121
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:36,273
Bob works there as a barkeeper.
He will help us. Hurry up!

122
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:39,736
- With no money?
- I know where we will get some.

123
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:42,895
If we keep on talking they will catch us.

124
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,526
I hope that Williams will get us out of here.

125
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,698
Let's go.

126
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,833
Hey. All dressed up darling, huh.

127
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,942
But you wouldn't leave without me, right?
Hurry up and open the door.

128
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:02,519
- And if I don't do it?
- I scream and all hell will break loose.

129
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,891
Come on, let's hurry up!

130
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:06,204
And what about her?

131
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,079
She has to come with us.
She has heared everything...

132
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,057
...and if they interrogate her
she will tell them everything.

133
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,199
Don't, I'm afraid!

134
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,627
You are not gonna ruin this for the rest
of us, if have to break your neck myself.

135
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,025
Come, hurry!

136
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,779
Come on, let's hurry up!

137
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:50,155
Hm, she is still not giving her
control sign. Oh, there she is.

138
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,751
Something must have happened.

139
00:13:56,624 --> 00:14:00,531
Let us in! Anyone who tries to stop
us will get a hole in their stomach.

140
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:05,602
They gonna lock you up again anyways.
If you go back to your cell I won't say anything.

141
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,616
Shut up! And no tricks.

142
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:12,335
Hurry up!

143
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:18,664
This one is for the first gate and
the staff entry in the back yard.

144
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:21,156
- No one is there right now.
- The guard there will check every 30 minutes.

145
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:25,524
I should shoot you in the back of the head.

146
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:29,778
Leave it. We tie them up first
and then tie them to the big pipes.

147
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,188
You are stuck here.

148
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:35,946
Make sure we don't have to go
back because it didn't work out.

149
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:40,489
If we run into one of the guards I'll shoot you.
You better make sure we don't get caught.

150
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,228
She'll sleep until we are gone.

151
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:48,185
Hurry up!

152
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:59,042
If the door is really open
do you know where to go?

153
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:02,022
- I've worked on this plan for 3 months!
- Someone is coming.

154
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,207
Let's get in here. Hurry up!

155
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:21,541
Shit! The night watchman.

156
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,881
- Is he on patrol?
- No, he is laying eggs.

157
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,469
Hide somewhere so he can't see you.

158
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:30,542
Let me tell you one thing: If you keep on
being this scared we gonna leave you behind.

159
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:33,366
Pull yourself together and don't be hysteric.

160
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:37,872
If he notices something we'll pull him inside
and say 'Good Night' to the night watchman.

161
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:48,319
Holy shit. That was close!

162
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,050
Hurry up.

163
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,451
Choose whatever you like but pick some
proper clothes and put some in a suitcase.

164
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,193
We have to be out of here in 10 minutes.

165
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:58,822
Let's go.

166
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:01,383
All the cash registers are empty.

167
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:04,313
They are not gonna keep them all
filled up over the weekend just for us.

168
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:07,167
If they have my size?

169
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:12,236
Maybe there is a safe in one of the offices.

170
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,823
Sure, but unfortunately
I'm a tailor and not a locksmith.

171
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,979
Maybe Jane can bite it open?

172
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,092
Somehow we'll get some money.

173
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:27,172
Better hurry up, this is not a fashion show.

174
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:36,005
Oh girls, finally I'm wearing real clothes again
and I feel like a real human being again.

175
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,797
- Hurry up.
- Yeah, yeah.

176
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:15,497
...failed catching the three women that
broke out of the prison yesterday evening...

177
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:21,515
The public has been warned. The women are armed
and we are worried that they will use their guns.

178
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:27,383
The murder of Francis Nipple, the manager
of the prison shows how relentless they are.

179
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:29,409
- She was...
- You goddamn liar!

180
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,859
No we are deep into it because of our "Gold Betty".

181
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,288
- The stupid cow killed Nipple.
- I knew it.

182
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,114
But they can't blame us for this.

183
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:42,935
Exactly. It's my problem and without
me you'd still be stuck in this cage.

184
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,329
We should kick you out you crazy bitch.

185
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,965
All you want is to inherit some money
and get in bed with a guy again.

186
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,712
Shut up and check what's going on over there.

187
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:56,322
Shit, the cops again.

188
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:59,079
- What are we gonna do?
- I'll get off this road.

189
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,042
If anyone want's to split they
can go. It's not far to the police.

190
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:26,698
Hurry up, we have no time.
We have to change cars.

191
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:29,079
- Yeah...
- Calm down. We are all gonna stay together.

192
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,176
It feels so good to be free again.

193
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,974
I'd rather played another game with you, Jim.

194
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,281
Well, I'll drive over to Marsh Village then.

195
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:49,617
- Business comes first.
- I'm not too keen of your services, Oskar.

196
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,947
- You think they have any money?
- No, too risky.

197
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:58,756
- Maybe there are more men inside the house.
- There couldn't be too many men if you ask me.

198
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:01,648
Look. The car with the old guy.

199
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:05,140
He is probably well known among the
locals so they most likey won't stop him.

200
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,561
- Your hearse needs a lot of gas.
- Yeah.

201
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:16,108
I have it since the war. An American
traded it for some homemade brew.

202
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,211
Maybe that's why it's drinking so much gas.

203
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,775
Well, hopefully the coffin has the right size for her.

204
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:28,035
Worst that can happen is that
she has to take off her high heels.

205
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:31,082
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

206
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:53,573
Do you need any help?

207
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:57,110
That's right! We need someone who can
get us through the police checkpoints.

208
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:03,313
Well, sure. You are the five
girls that escaped yesterday.

209
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:07,334
- How did you make it all the way up here?
- Don't ask any questions.

210
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:11,968
And remember this: If they catch us
you will become your own customer!

211
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,685
We gonna hide behind your seat and don't
forget that you have four guns pointing at you.

212
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:17,829
Get in there and behave yourself!

213
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,538
Let's go!

214
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:36,963
Where are we?

215
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:39,312
On the road to Dunbar.
It's another 30 miles to the coast.

216
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:41,816
You let us out at the Sheephelm Woods!

217
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:46,611
- But then you let me go, ok. I'm a poor man.
- Too bad!

218
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:50,205
- We thought you were Aga Khan.
- I won't say anything.

219
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:55,462
Alright grandpa. We would kill the cops
before they could even breath and you, too!

220
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,249
Yes, I understand. Nothing will happen.

221
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,102
Help! Being threatened! Careful!

222
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:10,946
Quiet now. Two cops.

223
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:14,416
I'll get rid of them, watch out.

224
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,854
Close the curtain.

225
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:20,246
- I'm scared to death.
- Shut up. Stop it!

226
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,224
- Hey guys, what's up?
- Hello, Oskar. Did someone die again?

227
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:30,620
Yes, over there in the village. It's a sad job.

228
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:35,327
You get used to it. We are looking for the
girls who caused the trouble in Belmoral.

229
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:41,958
- Up here in the Highlands, oh dear?
- That's what I said. Just a routine check.

230
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:45,225
An order is an order.
But we'll be gone in 2 hours anyways.

231
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,960
- Here, please.
- What, your papers?

232
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,895
Who want's to see them.
We know that you are a good guy.

233
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:56,073
- I thought I'd better be correct.
- You are crazy.

234
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,983
Can't even grab your papers right, huh.

235
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,618
Maybe it's time to suspend your licence.

236
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,068
Ok then, go to your funeral.

237
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:12,978
Come on, let's go.

238
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:30,439
Out!

239
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,272
- What do you want from me?
- Let's go!

240
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,121
Come on grandpa. We get you off
the road and then we let you go.

241
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:42,906
What are they doing with him?

242
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:49,357
Sylvia, they promised to let him go.

243
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,226
- You can't let this happen.
- Stay here.

244
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:10,082
- You did it, now we are sitting in the same boat.
- Damn it, don't start arguing with me.

245
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,947
How much longer until we get
to this goddamn roadhouse?

246
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:15,233
We still have to make it through the marshes.
We will be at the Ellis Inn in one hour.

247
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:22,649
You should take a gin
as well if David is paying for it.

248
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,777
Thanks, but I'm still on
duty until 5:00 PM. Overtime.

249
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:30,962
Oh yeah, because of the 5 girls. As if
they would come here to Sheephelm.

250
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:34,335
If you ask me not even a pickpocket
would come here, it's a boring place.

251
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:39,831
- I like it here.
- Some fishermen and hunters, that's not much.

252
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,673
When I'm off I drive around here and there.

253
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:45,198
London isn't the only place
with accomodating women.

254
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:48,601
Yeah, you civilians have it
easier to pick out the raisins.

255
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:52,664
Derek, I tell you. The tourist bus
last week was full with Swedes.

256
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,155
Don't believe a word he is saying.

257
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:58,657
The bus was full with old women.
Hill is anything but a womanizer.

258
00:23:58,658 --> 00:24:01,302
- Thank you, boss.
- You are like a father to me.

259
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:07,061
I really am. I've treated you like
a raw egg since you came here.

260
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:11,234
You won't find someone easily who
would run this boring place with you.

261
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,005
- Mr. McIntosh.
- Oh, the Police President in person.

262
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:52,340
Unfortunately I'm still a Sergeant, Sir.

263
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:55,263
Well, if you think about it Winston Churchill
was already a Major when he was your age.

264
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:59,854
And when A.Lincoln was your age, Mr. McIntosh,
he was already the President of the USA.

265
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:04,205
If you've got nothing in the head
you'll have to become a policeman.

266
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:08,998
The old deadbeat gets
the worst room we have.

267
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:12,358
- Good day.
- Good day. Our beloved salesman is back.

268
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,784
- Let me carry up your luggae, ok.
- I don't like people wasting things.

269
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:17,413
How long are you going to stay this time?

270
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,260
Until I'm done with this area.

271
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:24,294
I also have women's clothing now,
in case you need something for a girlfriend.

272
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,966
I will get a discount if I spend
one night out of the house, right?

273
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:33,652
Yes, we take it off the bill. Same
with the breakfast without butter.

274
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:36,269
And if you don't want
any jam it gets even cheaper.

275
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,269
That sounds good. Gluttony is
unhealthy but austerity is a virtue.

276
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,260
You are very friendly Mr. Ellis.

277
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:49,084
Shabby freeloader.

278
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,004
Betty! Betty, how did you get here?

279
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:50,309
- You have no idea what I've been through.
- Be quiet.

280
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:53,419
Who told you where to find me?

281
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:57,352
Are you one of the five who escaped? Betty!

282
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:02,254
Is that all you have to say?

283
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:06,926
You have to understand me. If they catch you they
will get me too. You have to leave immediately!

284
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:10,637
I didn't come alone.
You have to help us, Bob!

285
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:13,497
Since our trouble back then I've been hiding.

286
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:17,183
No one knows who I am.
You have to try it elsewhere. Betty!

287
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:19,290
- Bob Fishman!
- My name is Bob Hill!

288
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:26,936
- Bob Fishman!
- You know that I'm not alone.

289
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:31,144
You will hide us here
and try to get us some money.

290
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:34,694
But what about David Ellis?

291
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:38,025
We are waiting in the barn. Make sure that
no one finds us and that we get some food.

292
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:42,339
Do you think I went to
prison to be sent way now?

293
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,302
Don't try any tricks. If they
catch us they will get you, too!

294
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:50,225
- We'll discuss the rest at the barn.
- Betty, what are you thinking?

295
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:51,101
What are your plans?

296
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,357
We gonna kidnap Mrs. Oland
and get 20.000 Pound.

297
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:58,181
And with that money
we will get out of England.

298
00:27:58,182 --> 00:28:03,287
Oland? The land owners insane wife? But...

299
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:11,804
- Hello, Bob? Did someone arrive?
- No, boss. I'm closing for today.

300
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:15,435
Did she jump straight into
bed with her sunny boy?

301
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:18,524
And what if she takes off with the guy?

302
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:24,004
We are right here. He'll come over in a
second. I could talk to him for a minute only.

303
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:29,746
- And?    - As soon as the old
men is asleep we will see.

304
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:33,783
- See what?
- I already told you we gonna do this.

305
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:39,394
We gonna kidnap that rich woman I
used to work for. I've worked it all out.

306
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:45,686
She has all the money from her husband.
Every day she drives to the doctor in Sheephelm...

307
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:48,804
...and she visits the cemetery there.
Her name is Marilyn Oland.

308
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:04,806
Every time you come with
me you mess up my schedule.

309
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:08,405
Doris always gets me here on time but
with you I have nothing but trouble.

310
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:10,439
- The doctor will be mad of me.
- Why?

311
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:13,881
Because he has been making a
fortune from you for years by...

312
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,434
- ...convincing you that you have some diseases?
- It's my money, right.

313
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,904
I'm sorry, Jack. I meant to say
that it's my part of the inheritance.

314
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:25,081
Masterson is an excellent
doctor and he understands me!

315
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:28,926
Yes, of course darling.
It's important that you get well again.

316
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:33,114
You heal the soul with love
and patience and not with medicine.

317
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:38,551
It was my mistake to not
take the Jeep to run my errands.

318
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,216
Shall I take you upstairs, madame?

319
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:48,641
For weeks I've been walking around by myself.
I'm not insane so don't treat me like a lunatic.

320
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:52,279
- May I get the magazines and the usual
things then, madame? - Yes, my dear.

321
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,823
In 30 minutes you'll pick me up again and
then we visit Johnny at the cemetery.

322
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:55,622
Are you coming, too?

323
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:58,456
- If I dont get hold up at the police station.
- Of course.

324
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:01,421
The building licence for the
tractor hall is more important than me.

325
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,650
- If she want's she can walk like a weasel.
- You have to pull yourself together.

326
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:10,261
- We have to find a way... We have to!
- Go now before we look suspicious.

327
00:30:10,262 --> 00:30:12,470
Money. Always the goddamn money.

328
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:19,358
- This time you can solve the case in no time.
- Case, how absurd. That isn't even a case.

329
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:23,229
It is murder! Yes!

330
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:27,991
The parrot of Mrs. Sweetcake
did not die of natural causes!

331
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:30,361
Proof it!

332
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:34,015
Katie Lissat bought rat
poison at the pharmacy...

333
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:37,424
...although there aren't
any rats in all of Sheephelm...

334
00:30:37,424 --> 00:30:39,964
...and she hated her neighbour's parrot...

335
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:43,639
...because it used to call her
a dumb Dora when she passed her house.

336
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,106
Ok. I will order a dissection,
cross examine Katie Lissat...

337
00:30:47,107 --> 00:30:51,287
...and get some specialists from London.

338
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:52,357
Would that be good enough for you?

339
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:55,107
So you are making fun of me, huh?

340
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,694
Hercules! Come here you bad dog.

341
00:30:57,695 --> 00:31:01,145
Don't try to eat the policeman
or you will get a bad stomach.

342
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:02,848
What a nice little guy.

343
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:05,401
You could've given him some
of your ham sandwich.

344
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:06,671
Then he might like you better.

345
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,094
- He is fat enough!
- And so are you!

346
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:11,361
- Good day.
- Good day Mr. Woodland.

347
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:13,677
Good bye Inspector.

348
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:19,713
- Did she have another horror story for you?
- She is getting even worse.

349
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:23,605
What can I do for you, Sir?

350
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:27,608
My gun licence has
expired and I want to renew it.

351
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:29,845
Masterson says that a change of
scenery would do me some good.

352
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,159
He said I'm strong enough to walk.

353
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:32,913
I asked him how I should
do something like this.

354
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:36,103
I can't leave Dolly behind me
with all the terrible people.

355
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:40,677
Hello Mrs. Oland.
I've been meaning to visit you.

356
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:44,767
But then the murder of the parrot happened
and I had to take care of Mrs. Sweetcake.

357
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:46,023
Sure Mrs. Twaddle.

358
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:49,343
I have to lend you this book
that reminds so much of you.

359
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:52,614
It's about a woman who tries
to commit suicide after her child died.

360
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:55,405
Then they put her into an insane
asylum and when she gets released...

361
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:58,995
...she finds out that her husband is having
an affair with a younger woman and kills...

362
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:05,593
Oh well, here the story changes and
hasn't got anything to do with you.

363
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:09,941
But the beginning of the
story has touched me so much.

364
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:15,186
I can see that. Bring me the book, I'm
interested to find out how the story ends.

365
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:18,205
Let's go my dear.

366
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:21,837
Good-bye, Good-bye!

367
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,317
What an arrogant person!

368
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:52,209
I've locked everything.

369
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:57,420
I put the pigs head in the freezer.
We can cut it up tomorrow.

370
00:32:57,421 --> 00:33:01,567
- Are you in a bad mood?
- Nah.

371
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:04,258
I just want to get out of
here again for a day or two.

372
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:07,149
We aren't busy at the moment anyways.

373
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,543
Sure. So the policeman got
some funny ideas in your head.

374
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:16,244
Oh, no. I got a message from a friend
of mine. She is visiting Glasgow.

375
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,674
- So I was right then.
- Why?

376
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:22,803
I thought I heard you talk
to someone in the bar.

377
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:27,649
No. I mean I got a call.
I was on the phone.

378
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,977
Huh, that's weird. I didn't hear the phne ring.

379
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,164
Do you think that I'm lying?

380
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:37,711
Why shoud I think that?
It's your business anyways.

381
00:33:37,712 --> 00:33:41,043
Excuse me boss.
I didn't mean it.

382
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:45,115
You have to get cranky if you don't have
some change. Have a nice two days off.

383
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:46,298
- Hello, Mr. Ellis!
- Yes.

384
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,483
What does he want now?

385
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:56,071
The five female fugitives are still on the run!

386
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:01,482
I invited myself for dinner at a friend of mine.

387
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:03,840
He lives over in Red Coast.

388
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,646
Right by the harbour. I will
probably stay there over night.

389
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:09,826
Good for you. I will go upstairs.
Good night gentlemen.

390
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:12,217
Thank you. People who
sleep can't commit any sins.

391
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,265
- Come with me. I'll let you out.
- Very nice of you.

392
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:17,341
I've got to take care of
something in the backyard.

393
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:37,251
Betty, we have to be careful. You
can't been seen outside the barn.

394
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:41,524
I knew that I can count on you. The others
are suspicious of you. Come with me.

395
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:50,097
See, this is Bob!

396
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:56,621
- Well then, good evening.
- Hello, I'm Jane.

397
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:59,601
Hello, how was the trip?

398
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:02,150
- Shit! But now we are here.
- Esther!

399
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:14,302
It's not this easy.
You can't stay here!

400
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:17,741
And if we lock up the old guy
until we have finished the job?

401
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:20,474
And if someone asks we tell
them that he is visiting someone.

402
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:23,152
Doesn't he have anything saved up,
a box of gold or something?

403
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:26,324
Maybe a handful of change but that's all.

404
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,532
- Who is this?
- This is David.

405
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,878
I didn't know that...
How should I know?

406
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:37,552
I mean, you could've just told me that you have
friends here and hadn't bothered you, Bob.

407
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,888
You bring in an akward position, boss.

408
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,821
You aren't gonna hurt me?
Of course I'm on your side.

409
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:45,985
I give you my word. You
can always depend on me!

410
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:47,891
I never told on anyone.

411
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:51,258
Why don't you come inside the house
to warm up and eat some food.

412
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:54,273
- He knows who we are so it's all his own fault.
- Well, I can imagine.

413
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:58,795
It's in all the newspapers and it
was all over the radio and TV.

414
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:03,820
- But Bob? What are they going to do?
- Most problems solve themselves.

415
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:08,642
I think we should make ourselfs comfortable
first and keep our host from betraying us.

416
00:36:08,643 --> 00:36:11,395
I do whatever you want.
Please, come with me.

417
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:14,859
Sylvia, take the teary one with you.
And we will fill you up with brandy.

418
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:18,480
- That's what we all should do.
- I will get wasted like a group of Cossacks.

419
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:45,178
I feel so dizzy. All the excitement.

420
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,084
And the alcohol, I can't take it...

421
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,342
- Thank you. My heart is too old for this.
- What's going on here?

422
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:05,100
Did I fall asleep?
Damn whiskey!

423
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:06,101
Shitty stuff.

424
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:22,052
- Where is...
- Your Adam is upstairs with Jane.

425
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:25,553
I bet they are playing daddy and mommy.

426
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,741
Open the door!

427
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,548
- You dirty pigs!
- Are you crazy! Betty!

428
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:46,914
- Don't touch me you dirty dog!
- Stop it!

429
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:50,250
That's what I went through all of this for?
I gonna kill you!

430
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,084
I gonna kill the both of you!
You dirty pigs!

431
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:59,907
- I gonna show you...   - Let me exlain.
- She went crazy.

432
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:05,231
- I gonna bash your head in!
- Stop it!

433
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:08,300
You are all idiots!
You goddamn idiots!

434
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:13,000
Let go of her!
Do you want to kill each other?

435
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:17,304
- Sort it out later.
- We were just talking.

436
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:19,245
Why all the drama?

437
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:23,266
- Where is the old guy?
- Downstairs, with Linda.

438
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:28,050
- Hurry, they gonna be back in a minute.
- Hello, police!

439
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:31,709
Watch out!

440
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:51,217
Why are you looking at
me like this? I shot him!

441
00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:53,842
One more or one less doesn't really matter.

442
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:58,070
What had you done?
Let thim call the police?

443
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:01,147
Wait a moment!
There is someone.

444
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:09,641
It's Cooper. He must've seen the
light or have heard something.

445
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:14,030
You two get her upstairs
and keep her mouth shut!

446
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,752
And you hide the body!

447
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,636
Wait for me in the backyard.

448
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:22,138
Don't tell us what to do!
You better distract the policeman.

449
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:26,096
Shut up, you whore!

450
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,268
- Open the door!
- Yes, I'm coming!

451
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:29,873
One moment!

452
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,892
Stupid lock.

453
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,475
I saw that the light is still on.

454
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:44,817
Yes, good evening. We were
opened a little bit longer today.

455
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:47,057
- Why are you still on patrol?
- Because of Oskar.

456
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:50,282
- Have you seen him?
- Not today, why?

457
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:54,111
He and his hearse have been
missing since this afternoon.

458
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,701
Danning sent me, maybe
something happened to him.

459
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:57,919
What should've happened to him?

460
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,014
- That's what I said.
- Coke or beer?

461
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:01,335
Coke please.

462
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,564
- Oh, you have guests?
- Why?

463
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:09,517
- Oh, you mean because of this.
- I thought I've heard some women's voices.

464
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:12,761
Here you go. Well, that's possible.

465
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:17,300
Mr. Hill where did my...
Good evening Sergeant.

466
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,802
This is Sergeant Cooper.
And this is David's niece.

467
00:40:22,803 --> 00:40:25,062
- It's my pleasure Mrs. ...
- Elders.

468
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:27,479
Excuse me, I didn't know...
Are you gonna stay for a while?

469
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,047
Only for a couple of days.
Uncle David is in Glasgow.

470
00:40:30,048 --> 00:40:32,668
Our family has inherited some money
and he has to take care of some things.

471
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:33,925
Until then I will help out around here.

472
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:37,713
So I was right about the female voices.
Did you bring your sister with you?

473
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:39,402
Only a friend of mine
but she just went to bed.

474
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,961
My uncle didn't want to
leave me alone with Mr. Hill.

475
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:43,739
Yeah, yeah good old Bob.

476
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,093
You might meet her if
you come back tomorrow.

477
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:50,204
We were celebrating and
she had a little bit too much.

478
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:55,549
- Smart uncle David.
- May I make a call real quick?

479
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,691
- You can call right here from the bar!
- He's under the table.

480
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,550
I can call from here, just want
to know if there are any news.

481
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:02,765
Hello? 0-1-1.

482
00:41:03,202 --> 00:41:03,894
Yes, please.

483
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:08,732
Hello, Inspector. Cooper
here, I'm at the Ellis Inn.

484
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,127
No, no one has seen him.

485
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,695
No, nothing. Ok, Sir. Excuse me?

486
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:24,848
Ok, boss. I'll drive down to
the moor and then come back.

487
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:30,511
- Excuse me miss but I have to leave.
- See you tomorrow then. Good night.

488
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:32,385
Good night, Sergeant.
See you tomorrow.

489
00:41:32,386 --> 00:41:34,207
Good night.

490
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:41,433
- Is he gone?
- Yes, he is gone.

491
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:46,953
- But this guy has to go as well.
- Bob has to get rid off him.

492
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:49,046
It's too dangerous today.

493
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:53,342
It's gonna be tomorrow soon
and we have a lot of things to do.

494
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:57,188
There is room enough in here.

495
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:34,620
- You got some nerves!
- And tomorrow I gonna need them again.

496
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:37,239
And now I need a couple of hours of sleep.

497
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:41,377
No... No...

498
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:52,654
- What's the matter?
- It's all good between us again.

499
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,960
I don't know.

500
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:57,410
I don't even know if I'm still able to love.

501
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:01,385
We have to go through this together
and then forget everything.

502
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:04,803
Forget?
How could I forget?

503
00:43:05,128 --> 00:43:08,163
My faith in a way to a better life, huh?

504
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:18,310
The prison? Full of meanness,
perfidity and hatred. And Nipple...

505
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:23,639
It was self defense. What else could you've done?
Yes, I just fought back.

506
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:27,934
Also against two old
man reporting us to the police.

507
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:30,726
To bring us back to this hell.

508
00:43:31,816 --> 00:43:35,986
And the realisation that I don't
mean anything to you anymore.

509
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:39,654
- No, Betty. You have to...
- Yes, I know it.

510
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:42,231
All my life I have fought against everything.

511
00:43:42,232 --> 00:43:46,458
Against my parents and against
everything that made sense.

512
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:50,257
Against people who
only had the best intentions.

513
00:43:50,258 --> 00:43:54,492
But I never fought against
one thing: The bad and the evil.

514
00:43:58,161 --> 00:44:01,959
- Try to get some sleep.
- Not everyone has the same kind of morals.

515
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:06,138
Everything that happens in
the world is good for something.

516
00:44:08,373 --> 00:44:12,187
What I did, too?
And what I will do, too?

517
00:44:13,908 --> 00:44:16,920
Because there's nothing else I can do
and because there is no turning back.

518
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,287
Get lost! You annoying thing!

519
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:32,756
Hercules! Come to mommy.

520
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:35,138
Leave this whiskey bottle in a uniform alone.

521
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,657
Maybe it's time I order
you to give him a muzzle.

522
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:45,930
Sure, muzzles for the tax payers and
muzzles for people who voice their opinion.

523
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:49,012
As long as we have you no one
will dare to come to our area!

524
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:51,743
I doubt that. Have you
taken care of the new murder yet?

525
00:44:51,744 --> 00:44:54,591
Who is it this time? The teacher's goldfish?

526
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,697
Or the pastor's guinea pigs?

527
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:59,285
Mr. Oskar has been missing since yesterday.

528
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:04,455
I would be worried about that. Even if I
was a cop who doesn't use his brain!

529
00:45:04,456 --> 00:45:06,218
Good day Inspector!

530
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:09,304
Please, Mrs. Ellis.
You don't have to wait on me.

531
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:12,468
I'm always allowed to eat in the
kitchen when your uncle is here.

532
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:15,970
But today you will be spoiled!
I'll give you a first class service.

533
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:20,986
What could make this morning better
after I've already made your acquaintance?

534
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:25,036
I will try to get my commissions
done real quick today.

535
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:31,838
Maybe we can have a
little chat later tonight, huh?

536
00:45:32,788 --> 00:45:38,977
And maybe I'll get to meet the friend
of yours Mr. Hill was talking about.

537
00:45:38,978 --> 00:45:42,284
- Sure, Mr. McIntosh.
- "McIntosh", please call me Lupus.

538
00:45:42,285 --> 00:45:46,481
Lupus is latin for "The Wolf".

539
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:49,226
Ok, Lupus! We have to clean up
around and you are just in our way.

540
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,127
Oh, I'll just take a lemonade
out of the freezer then and leave.

541
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:56,395
No!
Don't!

542
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:03,760
We just put fresh game in there
and it has to freeze properly.

543
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:09,166
- The lemonade is outside at the bar!
- Thank you. I'll grab one for my route then.

544
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:13,362
See you tonight then, Mrs. Ellis.

545
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:14,947
Good day, Mr. Hill.

546
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:21,837
- What an idiot!
- Do you think he recognized anything?

547
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:25,974
We have to hide the old guy somewhere
else. Let's put him in the storage room.

548
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:53,958
Bitch is freaking out,
maybe she's gone crazy.

549
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,059
Grabs my gun and wants
to do things her way now.

550
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,295
Give me the gun and
don't freak out here.

551
00:47:00,296 --> 00:47:03,927
Do you really think they'll take you
for Queen Elizabeth in that outfit?

552
00:47:03,928 --> 00:47:08,597
They'll catch you right away
and then they'll get us too!

553
00:47:09,574 --> 00:47:13,026
- Don't come any closer or I'll shoot!
- What the hell are you doing?

554
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:15,166
There is nowhere to go without any money.
We have enough problems already!

555
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:20,274
I want nothing to do with you! Maybe it's
not too late for me yet if I turn myself in.

556
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:25,270
I won't tell anyone where to find you.
And if they tear me to shreads.

557
00:47:25,271 --> 00:47:30,336
- But let me go!
- You stay with us until everything is over!

558
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:33,013
Come here, give me the gun!

559
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:39,792
Stay there. Stay there or I shoot!

560
00:47:40,922 --> 00:47:44,844
Shoot!
Shoot at me if you dare!

561
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,680
Why aren't you shooting
you stupid thing!

562
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:52,864
Don't try anything like this again, understand!

563
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:58,882
- Stop!
- Oops! Hello. What a greeting.

564
00:47:58,883 --> 00:48:02,322
You probably wanted to hug me, huh?
Please, don't let me stop you.

565
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:05,025
I'm Gary Cooper, the nicest
Sergeant in all of Sheephelm.

566
00:48:05,026 --> 00:48:06,271
And I'm the only one.

567
00:48:06,272 --> 00:48:10,633
Good morning beautiful
man. This is my friend.

568
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:14,725
- You scared her like she's seen Dracula.
- I'm sorry, it's only the uniforme.

569
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:19,733
Hey Gary. Starting early today?

570
00:48:20,386 --> 00:48:23,815
- Any news about Oskar?
- No, that's why I'm driving over to Red Coast.

571
00:48:23,816 --> 00:48:26,015
Maybe police headquarters
will have to take care of it.

572
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:27,751
Let's have a drink!

573
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:34,045
Just one wrong word
and all hell breaks loose.

574
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:36,852
Would be a pity for the
nice little man, right?

575
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,126
Do you want to see the area
or have you been here before?

576
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,697
No, never. This is the first time.

577
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:47,047
Hopefully not the last time.

578
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:50,011
I don't know anyone around here.
I just happened to come here by chance.

579
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:52,594
Well, this policeman right
here is pretty impressed.

580
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:57,122
I'm off in two days and it would be
an honour to show you around.

581
00:48:57,123 --> 00:49:02,350
Oh, yes. I'd like that very much but
I don't know if we... If I'm still here.

582
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:05,171
You can be happy to see something Mary.

583
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:08,166
Otherwise you'll just sit around here and...

584
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:11,668
...you don't have to be afraid of
this heavily armed James Bond.

585
00:49:11,669 --> 00:49:15,641
We are not armed, but I guarantee
that I will bring her back in one piece!

586
00:49:15,642 --> 00:49:19,951
Right, you poor guys don't
even carry a revolver.

587
00:49:19,952 --> 00:49:26,191
No, only on special occassions.
But you remind me that duty calls.

588
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:32,430
Thank you Bob! Good-bye Mrs. Linda.
And don't forget our 'date'.

589
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:35,668
- If you like, huh?
- Good-bye Mr. Casanova.

590
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,764
That's what they call love at first sight, huh?

591
00:49:40,765 --> 00:49:42,810
I'll take you to our other couple.

592
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:45,634
I hope they don't find the coffin
maker before we are out of here.

593
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:48,455
I have to be in Sheephelm in two hours!

594
00:49:48,456 --> 00:49:50,675
Yeah, that's about
the time she is there.

595
00:49:50,676 --> 00:49:52,422
I asked around and
it's still the same time.

596
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:54,723
But do you really want to go by yourself?

597
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:57,055
You are too well known in the
area, but I'll take Jane with me.

598
00:49:57,056 --> 00:49:58,757
You want to take Jane?

599
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:02,503
Yes. I hate her guts but
at least she's got balls.

600
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:11,879
The cop is gone.
Betty wants you to join her.

601
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,332
- I've heard everything you coward.
- Why are you calling me a coward?

602
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,709
Because you are afraid of her and...

603
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:17,726
...because she got you down on
your knees and into her bed.

604
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,342
She is unpredictable.

605
00:50:19,343 --> 00:50:22,647
She could've get us all
caught because of her rage.

606
00:50:22,648 --> 00:50:24,439
Yeah, what if I'd do something like that?

607
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,650
You are way too smart for this.

608
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:29,390
You know that we have a
whole life ahead of us. Together!

609
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,328
Get some fresh flowers, Miss Doris!

610
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:32,644
You know what kind.
What are you waiting for?

611
00:51:32,645 --> 00:51:36,994
Take your time. I want to talk a
little bit longer with Johnny today.

612
00:51:42,543 --> 00:51:45,320
I didn't bring you any candy today, darling.

613
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:49,911
Dr. Masterson is against it.
He says it's bad for your teeth.

614
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:55,141
Are you in pain again?
Be patient.

615
00:51:57,198 --> 00:52:01,255
It's your birthday next week.
What would you like?

616
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:10,641
Yes Johnny? A bicycle? You should have it then.
But you have to promise not to ride it too fast!

617
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:15,789
The son of the Sweeping's family had a fatal
accident with his bicycle. I told you, remember?

618
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:18,054
Yes. He is dead.

619
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:24,810
Excuse me, I didn't want to scare you.

620
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:27,887
I won't do it again. I promise!

621
00:52:33,342 --> 00:52:35,318
Good day Mrs. Oland.

622
00:52:36,776 --> 00:52:40,298
- Betty? - Yes.
- Did my husband send you to pick me up?

623
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:43,619
- He said we should hurry.
- Did something happen?

624
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:47,452
You have to tell me. Not like the other time
with Johnny when no one told me anything!

625
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:51,109
- Has there been an accident, Betty?
- Not a bad one, just a little accident.

626
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,710
- I have to go see him immediately!
- Do you have a pair of car keys as well?

627
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:58,280
That's ok, the keys are in the car. Doris
can figure out how to get back by herself.

628
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,926
There is someone I don't know.
Does she work for us?

629
00:53:30,927 --> 00:53:33,578
But Mrs. Oland, that's our new cook.

630
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:38,861
Listen, yesterday's pheasant was
terrible. You have to try harder.

631
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,304
Ok, aunty. I'll try to remember.

632
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:51,356
Mrs. Oland! Mrs. Oland!

633
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:59,941
To Mr. Jake Oland. Urgent.

634
00:54:10,185 --> 00:54:14,500
Hercules! What's the matter.
Come back here!

635
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:19,316
What are you sniffing around for?
Ugh, Hercules!

636
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:22,549
Stop it. Come back here you dirty dog.

637
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:56,062
Betty is back! She parked the car inside
the barn. I've seen her from upstairs.

638
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:58,701
We have to get the old guy out of the
house. In here it's too dangerous.

639
00:54:58,702 --> 00:55:00,589
Esther is with the old woman.
We can take care of the old guy later.

640
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:08,172
- Alright then.
- Where did you take me?

641
00:55:08,173 --> 00:55:11,265
I don't understand.
What is this about?

642
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,395
I want to go back to my husband now!

643
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:16,879
Alright, but you'll have
to stay with us for a while.

644
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,259
How dare you!
Who are you anyways?

645
00:55:19,294 --> 00:55:21,423
The new cook my dear.

646
00:55:21,424 --> 00:55:24,787
And if you don't do what
we tell you I'll beat you up!

647
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:30,366
- Bring her upstairs into room # 5.
- You are hurting me. What have I done to you?

648
00:55:32,149 --> 00:55:34,457
- Did everything work out?
- For now at least...

649
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:36,675
He should've got the letter by now.

650
00:55:36,676 --> 00:55:38,727
It's gonna be a nice surprise for Jake.

651
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:43,458
If you want to get back
your beloved wife well...

652
00:55:43,459 --> 00:55:46,887
...and alive put 20.000
Pound in small denominations...

653
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:50,086
They say they are going
to kill her if I call the police.

654
00:55:50,087 --> 00:55:53,374
- And if it's a trick of hers?
- No way. I know her better than that.

655
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,487
- The letter is real, Doris. Real!
- What are you going to do?

656
00:55:56,488 --> 00:56:01,868
Whatever they ask me to do. I will not call
the police to not risk the life of my wife.

657
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:04,533
I will come up with the
money and hand it over.

658
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,168
The kidnappers must be well informed.
But not well enough!

659
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:09,431
I don't understand.

660
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:13,085
- You don't have to.
- You wanted to tell me something?

661
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:16,952
Don't worry about it. I will do
what's best for the both of us.

662
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,497
Murder!

663
00:56:28,276 --> 00:56:32,310
Don't think about jumping out
of the window. It's pretty high.

664
00:56:32,345 --> 00:56:35,570
Our darling want's to get back to
her husband in one piece, right?

665
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:40,454
But not before he gives us the money.
And that wouldn't be very good for you.

666
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:46,295
Of course Jake will pay for me.
He would do everything for me.

667
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,474
I hope he doesn't forget Johnny's birthday.

668
00:56:54,336 --> 00:56:56,740
Our son wants a bicycle.

669
00:56:57,728 --> 00:57:01,226
He is a very nice and good kid.

670
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,678
Leave her alone.

671
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:17,055
- Mine would be around 4 years old now.
- Why did you do it?

672
00:57:17,718 --> 00:57:21,029
I hated it. I didn't
even know who it was from!

673
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:29,470
Three drunken sailors raped me. One after
the other. And no doctor wanted to help me.

674
00:57:29,505 --> 00:57:33,859
My boyfriend was in the military when it
happened and I wanted to keep it a secret.

675
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:42,686
- Mr. Hill. Help me! - What's going on?
- You have to call the police!

676
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:46,712
A terrible murder in the marshes...
his dead body... Mr. Oskar...

677
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:51,188
I found him. No, Hercules my dog has
found him. Oh my God, how terrible.

678
00:57:51,189 --> 00:57:53,390
Calm down Mrs. Twaddle!
I'm alone here. Mr. Ellis...

679
00:57:53,391 --> 00:57:55,641
I know, I know. Cooper told me.

680
00:57:55,642 --> 00:58:00,140
We have to call him. Quick!
Dead! He is dead!

681
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:02,913
- I've seen it with my own eyes!
- Maybe you are wrong.

682
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:08,734
No, believe me! You have to call the police
and they have to search the whole area!

683
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,673
Maybe the killer is still
hiding somewhere around here.

684
00:58:11,674 --> 00:58:14,112
Calm down Mr. Twaddle.
Here, have a drink first.

685
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:19,647
Here we go.
I go and call the Inspector.

686
00:58:27,095 --> 00:58:30,408
Hello? The police please!

687
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:34,409
Yes, hello. Is this you, Inspector?

688
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,887
This is Mr. Hill from the Ellis Inn.
I'm with Mrs. Twaddle.

689
00:58:37,888 --> 00:58:41,375
She has found something terrible.
Not far from here.

690
00:58:41,376 --> 00:58:48,716
The body of Mr. Oskar. Yes. Yes.
You are coming? Good.

691
00:58:48,751 --> 00:58:50,474
We are waiting for you.

692
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:59,290
The Inspector is on its way.
Excuse me, I'll go and change my shoes.

693
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:01,632
Here, have another one.
It will do you some good.

694
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:10,285
Murder! A real murder. In Sheephelm.

695
00:59:16,634 --> 00:59:19,515
Hercules! Come here!

696
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:23,319
Damnit. Hercules what's the matter?

697
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,637
She wanted to call the police
but I distracted her for a while.

698
00:59:25,638 --> 00:59:28,083
But once she realizes that the
Inspector isn't coming it's all over.

699
00:59:28,118 --> 00:59:30,158
- You have to get rid of her.
- Not her too.

700
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,242
But we have to do something.
She mustn't be by herself for too long.

701
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:39,106
What are you doing? This is
Mr. Ellis' place! Here, have a look.

702
01:00:01,122 --> 01:00:02,490
Stay inside, goddamnit!

703
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:08,647
Please help me! Oh my God!

704
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:11,261
Calm down. If you keep quiet
nothing will happen to you.

705
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:16,546
No, don't touch me. Don't
touch me! I don't want to die!

706
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:21,321
No! Careful!

707
01:00:24,832 --> 01:00:27,861
What is happening here?

708
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,472
I have got to say this is a nice evening.

709
01:00:36,473 --> 01:00:38,850
I haven't been entertained
like this in a long time.

710
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:44,963
- Cheers, Lupus!
- I never drink this stuff.

711
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:54,486
You are a drinker just like me!
We even have the same moves.

712
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:59,508
I don't even know why you
are treating me like this.

713
01:00:59,509 --> 01:01:03,974
It's for being a regular customer! I can't let
you go up to your room all sober, can I.

714
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:06,155
That's right. Never sober!

715
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:12,683
But you still haven't
introduced me to your girl friend.

716
01:01:14,945 --> 01:01:21,533
She went to bed a while ago. She isn't used
to the country life. But we'll do it tomorrow.

717
01:01:21,568 --> 01:01:24,427
- Am I not good enough for you, Lupus?
- No, not like this. You have to come closer.

718
01:01:24,428 --> 01:01:29,074
But Lupus! Mr. Hill could be back any
minute. He just went to the kitchen.

719
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:32,190
He can stay where he is! Oh, I'm sorry.

720
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:37,586
- I didn't mean to... Excuse me.
- That's ok. I get new glasses.

721
01:01:40,268 --> 01:01:44,813
- Just calm down. Ok?
- Ok.

722
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:48,049
I'm all calm.

723
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:53,327
We gonna party. With Lupus
McIntosh, the pride of Scotland.

724
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:58,327
I think he is finally totally drunk.
There has almost been an accident.

725
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,997
We have to leave in a couple of
minutes to pick up the money.

726
01:02:01,027 --> 01:02:03,592
Give her the sleeping pills
if you are staying here alone.

727
01:02:03,593 --> 01:02:05,279
I'm on it.

728
01:02:07,175 --> 01:02:12,072
Take these Mrs. Oland
and you will fall asleep. Good sleep.

729
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:14,392
And when you wake up it will be all over.

730
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,838
He is falling over any minute.
That's how drunk he is.

731
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:39,948
Good for him.
You filled him up pretty good.

732
01:02:39,949 --> 01:02:41,229
What's the matter?

733
01:02:48,009 --> 01:02:55,668
Oh, am I disturbing you?
Well in that case, good night everyone!

734
01:02:56,344 --> 01:02:57,838
Stop him!

735
01:03:00,952 --> 01:03:06,174
Someone is sitting on the toilet!
Sorry, wrong room.

736
01:03:09,563 --> 01:03:13,090
Lock him in his room! And get Jane
down here! What about Mrs. Twaddle?

737
01:03:13,091 --> 01:03:13,858
I got rid of her.

738
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:16,011
- And the dog?
- What do I know.

739
01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:25,707
Shit, this is risky. We should've
taken the drunk guy's car.

740
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:28,701
The car will show Mr. Oland
that we really have his wife.

741
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:32,617
- No one is out on the streets around this time.
- What if he is waiting for us with the police?

742
01:03:32,618 --> 01:03:38,016
It's my game! And my stakes!
We'll be there in a minute.

743
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:13,089
- I can't believe it worked.
- Check if the money is inside.

744
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:16,227
- Do you want me to count it?
- What for? We can count it at the Inn.

745
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:20,405
He wouldn't dare to rip us off.

746
01:05:20,406 --> 01:05:26,223
Now all we have to do now is
find a ship and sail southwards.

747
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:28,815
- It's not over yet.
- With money you can do anything.

748
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:38,829
We have to leave the Inn immediately.
Bob should've prepared everything.

749
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,737
What about Mrs. Oland?

750
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:43,506
We just leave her there and once she
wakes up again she can walk home.

751
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:46,030
If she wakes up...

752
01:05:53,309 --> 01:05:56,258
Have you ever seen
this much money at once?

753
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:59,459
Let's count it!

754
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,849
Damn, I don't believe this.

755
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:14,343
He fooled you like the worst idiots. Not
even the notes on the top are real ones.

756
01:06:14,344 --> 01:06:17,218
- What the hell?
- This dirty dog!

757
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:22,321
Stop it! Stop laughing!

758
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,509
What's going on?
War? Goddamn it!

759
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:34,798
Oh, a thunderstorm! What the
hell is all that noise downstairs?

760
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:53,371
I have to go to the toilet.

761
01:08:00,213 --> 01:08:06,749
Sir, are you always screaming around like this?
There are other guests too. Behave yourself.

762
01:08:21,672 --> 01:08:24,413
You fucking idiot!
How did this happen?

763
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:25,184
She is dead!

764
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:28,951
I don't know. Maybe it was the
excitement or the sleeping pills.

765
01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:43,195
This place looks nice.
Go and ask them.

766
01:08:43,196 --> 01:08:45,750
We can't keep on driving.
Emily needs a bed.

767
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:49,455
The night is almost over. I don't know
if I can get someone to open the door.

768
01:08:49,456 --> 01:08:52,726
The light is on and it's
probably not too expensive.

769
01:08:52,727 --> 01:08:56,850
Hello! Please open the door!
Please let us inside!

770
01:08:56,851 --> 01:09:00,112
There is someone inside but
maybe they don't want to upon up.

771
01:09:00,113 --> 01:09:01,480
Try again!

772
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:04,679
Let me through.

773
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,952
- But he has seen us from the outside.
- Doesn't matter.

774
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:10,119
We can't need any company now.
Mrs. Oland is dead, too!

775
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,116
What happened to her?

776
01:09:11,117 --> 01:09:13,407
What if it's the police?

777
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:19,576
We can't look suspicious. Go up to
Esther's room. Betty you go to the kitchen.

778
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,685
- Thank you very much. We thought you are...
- We are closed. What do you want?

779
01:09:30,686 --> 01:09:33,722
Excuse me, I thought
I had seen someone.

780
01:09:33,723 --> 01:09:35,907
Maybe, we are completely full.
You can stay in Sheephelm.

781
01:09:35,908 --> 01:09:38,225
Good morning!
Thank you for letting us in.

782
01:09:38,226 --> 01:09:41,295
Here, you left the bag
with the money in the car.

783
01:09:41,296 --> 01:09:43,767
My name is Haynes.
This is my wife and my daughter.

784
01:09:43,768 --> 01:09:46,887
Could you make some
tea for them please.

785
01:09:47,007 --> 01:09:50,747
Unfortunately we can't stay here.
They are totally full, Anne.

786
01:09:50,748 --> 01:09:55,903
That's too bad. Maybe we
can get something for Emily.

787
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:59,731
I can make you a tea but that's about it.

788
01:09:59,732 --> 01:10:01,435
We have been driving for 9 hours.

789
01:10:01,436 --> 01:10:05,286
We are taking Emily to a specialist
at the hospital in Glasgow.

790
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:09,397
He will operate on our little
girl so she can walk again.

791
01:10:09,815 --> 01:10:14,549
We had to borrow money from everyone
we know. The operation costs 2000 Pound.

792
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,797
Don't worry.
I'll hold on to the bag real good.

793
01:10:16,798 --> 01:10:20,089
Oh, the little girl is sick. I had no idea.

794
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,247
How should you?
But she will be well again, huh.

795
01:10:23,248 --> 01:10:27,205
Well, in this case... I give
you a room that was booked.

796
01:10:27,206 --> 01:10:29,636
You can have a rest
there for a couple of hours.

797
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,263
Thank you.

798
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:35,435
- What do you say. That's really nice of him.
- Yes.

799
01:10:37,263 --> 01:10:39,458
- This might get us out of here.
- Yeah, maybe.

800
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:42,070
If we make it to Red Coast,
Freddy can get us...

801
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,044
...across the canal
if we give him some money.

802
01:10:44,045 --> 01:10:46,146
- And how do we get their money?
- When they are sleeping.

803
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:47,942
It's almost day. The night is almost over.

804
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,246
I know, I'll put something in their
drinks so they fall asleep faster.

805
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:53,441
And I'll make some sandwiches
they can take up to the room.

806
01:10:57,303 --> 01:10:59,501
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

807
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:03,556
Here is the tea. I will bring
the sandwiches in a minute.

808
01:11:03,557 --> 01:11:07,162
The boss is making them.
Just a moment.

809
01:11:07,649 --> 01:11:11,084
Here you go, this will make you feel better.

810
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,944
- Did you recognize her?
- Who?   - The girl!

811
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:25,146
Betty Williams the alleged killer of
the prison manager is still on the run!

812
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:33,450
Yes, you might be right.
Or maybe she only looks like her.

813
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:37,877
It's her, I'm sure.
Paul, we have to warn the guy.

814
01:11:37,912 --> 01:11:40,019
Maybe she swindled her way in here...

815
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:45,136
Anne, let's stay out of this.
Let's pay and go.

816
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:49,938
Here is a little snack for you.
I'll show you to our rooms in a minute.

817
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:53,948
Good that you are here.
We have to tell you something.

818
01:11:53,949 --> 01:11:54,354
Anne, please.

819
01:11:54,355 --> 01:11:57,716
The girl that brought us
the tea. I recognized her.

820
01:11:57,717 --> 01:12:03,344
We have to do something. You were so
nice to us. I thought you should know.

821
01:12:05,563 --> 01:12:09,105
Too bad. You better hadn't
stopped here. But don't get upset.

822
01:12:09,106 --> 01:12:11,764
We want to get out of here
without any trouble. Betty!

823
01:12:11,765 --> 01:12:17,942
I have good ears. You are reading too
many papers. We'll have to improvise then.

824
01:12:24,502 --> 01:12:29,115
Hercules, where are you coming from!
Hercules, come here! Hercules!

825
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:35,639
Mrs. Twaddle! Mrs. Twaddle!
Are you here?

826
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:44,554
The cars are ready! We go together and
the other three follow us in the other car.

827
01:12:44,555 --> 01:12:47,366
Jane and us take Mrs. Oland's car!
Take the child and let's go!

828
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:49,537
No, don't! Don't take the child!

829
01:12:49,538 --> 01:12:52,896
Take the money and take me
with you but not the child.

830
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,450
Mommy what do they want from us?

831
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:58,111
We have to make sure you are
not sending the police after us.

832
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:02,308
If we make it to Red Coast without any
problems we will let her go! I promise!

833
01:13:03,821 --> 01:13:08,844
Here. Take it! Why don't
you shoot. You bastard!

834
01:13:08,845 --> 01:13:11,026
You'll get the child
only over my dead body!

835
01:13:11,027 --> 01:13:13,124
We'll see about this! Come on, Bob!

836
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:16,121
- Leave me alone.
- Oh no.

837
01:13:32,036 --> 01:13:35,344
The child stays here! You animals!

838
01:13:41,665 --> 01:13:43,337
Shoot!

839
01:13:48,909 --> 01:13:51,819
I only wanted to help.

840
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,237
Hurry up! Let's go!

841
01:14:04,846 --> 01:14:08,001
The car is to slow, they
gonna outdistance us.

842
01:14:08,002 --> 01:14:12,700
- Nah, we know where they are going.
- But they have the money and the child.

843
01:14:12,735 --> 01:14:16,403
If things get tough it will help them to
keep the cops in check. We can't do that.

844
01:14:17,599 --> 01:14:19,494
I wish we'd all day.

845
01:14:20,743 --> 01:14:25,400
When we are in Red Coast you can
go and drown yourself. We don't care.

846
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:39,500
- Inspector!
- Is it you, Sergeant?

847
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:40,839
Yes, Inspector!

848
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,818
I've followed the dog to the street,
he is running towards Ellis Inn now.

849
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:49,102
You go there! I get two cars from the
headquarters and meet up with you.

850
01:14:49,103 --> 01:14:50,541
Ok, Inspector!

851
01:14:59,115 --> 01:15:02,795
- Shit, there we have it. The police.
- Keep on driving right towards him.

852
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,439
- Stop!
- You stupid bitch!

853
01:15:11,933 --> 01:15:13,432
I gonna kill you!

854
01:15:19,399 --> 01:15:21,661
These are the... They are...
I will... I gonna get them.

855
01:15:21,662 --> 01:15:24,469
No, not them. The others. They
have a baby, we must follow them.

856
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:25,272
What others?

857
01:15:25,273 --> 01:15:27,884
Betty Williams and Bob Fishman
they took her as a hostage.

858
01:15:27,885 --> 01:15:29,505
Come with me, quick.

859
01:15:33,397 --> 01:15:34,539
They are far behind us.

860
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:37,262
They'll catch up. We are not
gonna waste any time on them.

861
01:15:37,263 --> 01:15:38,531
They can die for all I care.

862
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:42,410
- When are we letting the child go?
- When we are safe.

863
01:15:42,411 --> 01:15:44,854
I want my mommy.
Please let me go to my mommy.

864
01:15:44,855 --> 01:15:47,149
Of course you'll see your mommy again.

865
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:50,600
Take care of Mr. Oland.

866
01:15:50,601 --> 01:15:53,579
Yes, we have evidence.
She has been strangled.

867
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:57,698
- They have forced me. I was so desperate.
- If you are lucky you will get probation.

868
01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:02,952
- You think so?
- Yes, I testify that you weren't an accomplice.

869
01:16:02,953 --> 01:16:07,959
We are still looking for Mrs. Twaddle.
No news from Cooper yet?

870
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:13,298
We have informed Red Coast. Get back to
me as soon as the child has been found!

871
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:22,861
We are doing all we can, Mrs. Haynes.

872
01:16:22,862 --> 01:16:26,752
Why don't we drive to Red Coast?
Why not? I can't...

873
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:29,414
They are way ahead of us,
it wouldn't make sense.

874
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:31,211
Maybe they are going elsewhere.

875
01:16:32,618 --> 01:16:36,405
Inspector, we just got a report.
Patrol # 3 has caught two of the girls.

876
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,504
- It's Esther Burton and her girl friend.
- At least something.

877
01:16:43,185 --> 01:16:47,646
Well, we still have to write up
your testimony Mr. McIntosh.

878
01:16:47,647 --> 01:16:51,400
Please consider the condition I'm in.
I'm injured, maybe even fatally.

879
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:54,297
- That's just a scratch.
- That's enough for me.

880
01:16:54,298 --> 01:16:59,429
Are you sure that the man you saw in
the hallway last night was Jake Oland?

881
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,863
Of course!
Are you saying that I was drunk?

882
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:08,172
Well, if my initials are on it,
the bag must be my property.

883
01:17:08,173 --> 01:17:11,721
Why didn't you tell the police
about the kidnapping of your wife?

884
01:17:11,722 --> 01:17:14,737
- They threatened to kill her.
- And you paid them?

885
01:17:14,738 --> 01:17:18,807
- Of course I did, what do you think.
- In scraps of paper you did.

886
01:17:18,808 --> 01:17:22,014
You must be mistaken. Jake...
I mean Mr. Oland did...

887
01:17:22,015 --> 01:17:24,055
You stay out of it, Doris.

888
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,575
And how do you explain your
presence at the Ellis Inn last night?

889
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:31,071
- You were there? Jake!
- We have a witness.

890
01:17:31,072 --> 01:17:34,936
And your MG leaves
very destinctive tire marks.

891
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:38,074
- Does that mean...
- I am afraid so!

892
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:42,854
Ok. I'll have to come with you then.

893
01:17:42,855 --> 01:17:45,378
I'll just get my coat real quick, if I may.

894
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:51,423
You better come with us, too.

895
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:33,116
He isn't here, just a note
that he'll be back soon.

896
01:18:33,117 --> 01:18:34,506
I get the child out of here.

897
01:18:34,507 --> 01:18:37,454
Betty, hide the car behind the
warehouses so they won't it right away.

898
01:18:39,654 --> 01:18:41,938
You come with me! I'm
so used to your company...

899
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:44,261
...and I don't want the two of
you to be together without me.

900
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,715
Not so fast!

901
01:19:01,716 --> 01:19:05,886
What? The spot is perfect,
no one will see us here.

902
01:19:05,887 --> 01:19:08,617
Exactly. The same goes for you.

903
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:13,552
You must be crazy. Bob will kill
you if you come back without me!

904
01:19:13,553 --> 01:19:15,357
Hold your breath!

905
01:19:15,358 --> 01:19:19,441
I know that the both of
you wanted to get rid of me.

906
01:19:19,442 --> 01:19:24,595
But I won't let a dirty whore
like you steal my man.

907
01:19:24,596 --> 01:19:28,763
A man I did everything for.
Even murder!

908
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:34,498
- Betty, don't go crazy.
- My mind has never been this clear.

909
01:19:34,499 --> 01:19:37,516
I know that I still love Bob.
Despite everything.

910
01:19:37,517 --> 01:19:42,042
He will forget you and stay with me.
And we will live together without you.

911
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,530
Stop! Over there!
There's the child with the limp leg.

912
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:52,838
There she is!

913
01:20:00,994 --> 01:20:03,623
Emily! Goddamnit!

914
01:20:03,624 --> 01:20:06,031
Emily, don't worry. We are coming over.

915
01:20:06,799 --> 01:20:08,443
You stay here. I go!

916
01:20:11,802 --> 01:20:13,692
- Freeze, Fishman!
- Stay where you are.

917
01:20:13,693 --> 01:20:17,257
Don't come any closer!
I'm armed and I can see the child.

918
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:19,545
Shoot if you want.
If you want to take the risk.

919
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:21,192
You won't get away with this.

920
01:20:23,501 --> 01:20:25,451
I'll shoot if you don't back off!

921
01:20:58,601 --> 01:21:01,166
Where is my mommy?
I want to go to my mommy!

922
01:21:01,201 --> 01:21:04,666
Pull up the leg first.
Yes, just like this.

923
01:21:08,801 --> 01:21:11,554
Come over. Jump!

924
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:14,834
Get away there you idiot!

925
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:20,362
What have you done?
You... You...

926
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:25,675
He fell down.
Give me the gun.

927
01:22:25,676 --> 01:22:29,862
It makes no difference now.
It's all over.

928
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:36,226
Stop! Come back here!

929
01:22:36,227 --> 01:22:39,698
Come back!

930
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:41,574
What are you doing? Stop!

931
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:43,425
Stop! What are you doing?

932
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:51,014
Don't look!

933
01:23:35,934 --> 01:23:37,475
You have nothing to be afraid of, Miss!

934
01:23:37,476 --> 01:23:39,833
They will definitely take all the things...

935
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:42,142
...that you did for Emily and
her parents into consideration.

936
01:23:42,143 --> 01:23:42,924
Thank you, Sir.

937
01:23:43,694 --> 01:23:45,516
It won't take too long, Linda.

938
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:50,520
And then we have
to have our rendezvous.

939
01:23:50,521 --> 01:23:52,669
The rendezvous, remember?

940
01:24:02,512 --> 01:24:05,564
- Thank you, Derek. Good-bye!
- See you soon, Linda!

941
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:18,317
Come here you little orphan.

942
01:24:18,318 --> 01:24:20,936
We can need a hardworking assistent.

943
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:32,633
You damn beast. Get away from me.
