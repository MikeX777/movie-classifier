SCREENPLAY WRITER
ALEXEY KAPLER

45
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:19,698
Hello, comrades.

46
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:23,806
First of all, I want to explain to you
why I am standing here.

47
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,299
I was invited by my friends,

48
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:29,092
directors Sergey Yutkevich
and Anatoliy Karanovich,

49
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,158
to take part in this film as,
well, let's say,

50
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,919
a witness, a contemporary
of Mayakovsky.

51
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:41,613
Today, when monuments are
erected in honor of Mayakovsky,

52
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:44,513
when they study Mayakovsky in schools,

53
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:48,173
or rather, they "cover" Mayakovsky,

54
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:50,676
it's very difficult to imagine
what the poet

55
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,296
was during his lifetime,

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,157
what kind of storms
raged around him.

57
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:00,141
It seems I can still hear this...

58
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:05,880
this storm at the Polytechnic Museum,
this howling and roaring of his enemies,

59
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,688
the shouts of his friends
when he performed.

60
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,626
Mayakovsky was fearless,
he took the blows

61
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,326
and hit back outright.

62
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:16,009
We, young people, loved him infinitely.

63
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:18,475
He was our standard.

64
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:22,358
When the directors and I were
negotiating my participation in this film,

65
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:26,993
I asked them: "Very well, but
what if I don't like something in your film,

66
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,581
do I have the right to say this
to the audience

67
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:31,422
or should I praise everything?"

68
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,440
They answered:
"Say whatever you like".

69
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,780
And so, we came to terms.

70
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:40,438
That's how I found myself in this
pavilion of the film studio,

71
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:44,294
which has everything one needs
to create a film's image and sound.

72
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:49,825
Looking around, here you can see
the lighting equipment,

73
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:53,698
microphones and
the shooting equipment.

74
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:58,355
And at the top you can see something
that looks like a captain's cabin,

75
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,021
this is the place for sound engineers.

76
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,628
So if you hear me badly now,
it's their fault.

77
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:07,789
In short, here you are surrounded
by film equipment

78
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:11,954
which in the days of Mayakovsky
you couldn't even dream of.

79
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,708
The main character of this film
is the embodiment of the petty bourgeoisie -

80
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:23,407
Prisypkin, or Pierre Skripkin,
as he elegantly renamed himself.

81
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,310
Mayakovsky saw in the
petty bourgeoisie his mortal enemy.

82
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,914
and he fought against it
with the full force of his genius.

83
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,970
Of course, we understand that
now there's nothing to fight against

84
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,186
and there's no need for that because
the petty bourgeoisie is over forever.

85
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,709
There is none of it left.

86
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:44,228
Well, maybe just barely
noticeable manifestations.

87
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:49,568
Some car will rush along the street,
all decked out in colored ribbons,

88
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:54,440
and balloons, and with a
baby doll atop the radiator,

89
00:05:54,544 --> 00:06:00,384
and in this car sits a pompous Prisypkin
with a girl in a white veil.

90
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:05,109
Doesn't Prisypkin want an elegant life?

91
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:10,966
Doesn't he want a prestigious car
and contacts with celebrities?

92
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:16,384
To be serious, there are much more
dangerous manifestations

93
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,646
of petty bourgeois, of "Prisypkinism".

94
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,981
Because Prisypkin is the same
classic character

95
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:27,001
as Tartuffe, Khlestakov or Rasplyuyev,
for example.

96
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:31,664
I want to tell you, comrades, not to be
surprised that in this film

97
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:38,348
alongside the live actors you will see puppets,
animation, all this mixed together.

98
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:41,111
This is an experimental film.

99
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:43,145
Mayakovsky once said:

100
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:46,868
"The main thing depends on the breadth
of the director's vision".

101
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,367
Our directors' vision
was broad indeed.

102
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:51,780
Well, we'll see
what will come of it.

103
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:54,526
Now let's get acquainted with the actors.

104
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:59,998
The actor invited to the role of Prisypkin
is completely new to cinema.

105
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,697
He worked for a variety show studio.
He was never filmed,

106
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:09,234
and to find out how suitable he'd be
for this role, we made a screen test,

107
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:12,775
based on Mayakovsky's script
"Forget About the Fireplace".

108
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,985
Let's see this screen test.

109
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:27,133
Hey you, giver of enemas!

110
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:29,279
Write me a sick leave.

111
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,927
But you're not sick.

112
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:32,985
Aren't I?

113
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:41,424
You're absolutely healthy.

114
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,138
Healthy?

115
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,615
It's ticklish.

116
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,969
Tomorrow I'll be sick.

117
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:04,593
I'm always sick the day after payday.

118
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:10,291
Comrade doctor, close your health centre,
we're all going to the community work day.

119
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:18,061
And you - pay the "Russian
Autoroads" membership fee.

120
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:21,070
You haven't paid for six months.

121
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:22,756
Haven't I?

122
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:29,435
And what is this?
International Red Aid - paid!

123
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:33,022
Russian Red Cross - paid!

124
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,794
"Down With Illiteracy"...

125
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,051
"Down With Illiteracy"...

126
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:40,217
Here you are!

127
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:43,680
Not enough for you, huh?
The "Russian Autoroads"!

128
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,202
You won't get anything!

129
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:50,410
<i>You're snakes!
You're flayers!</i>

130
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:53,570
<i>You're pilfering my wage:
"Put it all on the table!"</i>

131
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:57,899
<i>Don't you touch me,
Why should I pay these fees?</i>

132
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,345
<i>What did I fight for?
What did I fight for?</i>

133
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:03,001
<i>What did I fight for?
Who goddamn knows!</i>

134
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:06,951
<i>If you're responsible,
this and that,</i>

135
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:10,552
<i>Then you have to pay
for everything.</i>

136
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:13,753
<i>Oh, no, my dear,
look for another fool!</i>

137
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:18,541
<i>I'll say, "Good luck",
and then be off.</i>

138
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:22,242
<i>I'll say, "Good luck",
and then be off.</i>

139
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:28,406
<i>They will pounce on me
and begin to embarrass me.</i>

140
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,705
<i>Well, bugger them all,
they're nothing to me.</i>

141
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:35,968
<i>It's not the 19th year,
I can indulge myself.</i>

142
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,385
<i>I'll get what I...!
I'll get what I...!</i>

143
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,871
<i>I'll get what I fought for!</i>

144
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:45,105
<i>We march together,
shoulder to shoulder.</i>

145
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,795
<i>We build roads, but what
have I to do with it?</i>

146
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,351
<i>Oh, no, my dear,
look for another fool!</i>

147
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:57,480
<i>I'll say, "Good luck",
and then be off.</i>

148
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:00,911
<i>I'll say, "Good luck",
and then be off.</i>

149
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,566
What do you think?
I think this is a suitable candidate.

150
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,631
This actor's name is Yuri Chernov.

151
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:10,118
Let me introduce him to you.

152
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,157
Gee! And where is Chernov?

153
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,910
Chernov is not there,
he's late again.

154
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,792
Again? He's always late!

155
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:19,261
- I'll find him.
- Okay.

156
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:24,894
You know, comrades, we could
re-shoot this scene with Chernov,

157
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,432
but I'd like to show you...

158
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:31,017
Hello! Sorry, I'm late.
But it's not my fault.

159
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,406
Our concert was far away and
we had problems with transport.

160
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,379
You should apologize not to me,
but to Iya Sergeyevna Savvina.

161
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:40,657
She always comes on time
and you made her wait.

162
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,483
Let's get acquainted.

163
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:44,728
I'll be your partner in this film.

164
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:47,160
I'll play the role of Zoya Beryozkina,

165
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:50,522
and in the course of the plot,
I'll have to fall in love with you.

166
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:53,100
Thank you.
Oh, sorry...

167
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:54,733
I'm Yura.

168
00:10:55,546 --> 00:11:01,095
Attention, get ready for the dubbing
of the episode "Dorm"!

169
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:06,125
It seems I forgot the text at home.

170
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:08,032
I have a lot of concerts,
so I forgot about it.

171
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:10,228
But I remember the musical parts!

172
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:12,669
It's okay, I'll help you.

173
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,578
This episode exactly follows
the text of the play.

174
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:16,823
You should remember that play.

175
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:22,654
We covered Mayakovsky at school,
but not "The Bedbug".

176
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,929
But I studied "The Bedbug",
Alexey Yakovlevich.

177
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:27,923
But I have a question.

178
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:31,374
At the very beginning of the play,
Zoya Beryozkina appears only for a moment,

179
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,357
and I, as an actress, don't have
time to understand

180
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:36,503
about the nuances of the relationships
between Zoya and Prisypkin.

181
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:39,839
Where did they meet?
How did they spend their time?

182
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,048
Where does Zoya work?

183
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:46,340
Mayakovsky the journalist will answer
these questions better than me.

184
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:49,748
He wrote "The Bedbug"
using newspapers materials.

185
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,392
And he has one saying:

186
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:57,080
"Together with me, this play was written
by the Komsomol and 'Komsomolskaya Pravda'".

187
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:01,051
I suggest you to take advantage
of your actor's imagination

188
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:05,829
and imagine yourself as Zoya Beryozkina
in that distant epoch.

calls himself Pierre Skripkin.

192
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:02,664
He met artists who said
he looked like Harry Piel.

193
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:06,565
After that, he began to go
to the movies more often.

194
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:10,566
He grew side burns.

195
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:16,980

barely washed himself for a month.

00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,273
And yet, I can't understand.

202
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,297
I can't understand.

203
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,864
She is a Komsomol member,
a young girl.

204
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:41,527
And she fell in love with this Prisypkin?
It's unbelievable.

205
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,110
Zoya was young, naive.

206
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:48,168
And he had a powerful instrument
of seduction - a guitar.

207
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,456
Mayakovsky hated vulgar things,

208
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,357
and he called people like Prisypkin
"romance-voiced" ones.

209
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:59,105
Mayakovsky mocked the popular romance
called "Forget About the Fireplace".

210
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,689
So he gave one of his scripts
the same name.

211
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,420
I did learn the romance of Prisypkin.
May I sing it?

212
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,799
<i>The moon hid behind a cloud -</i>

213
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:20,922
<i>It again goes out for a walk.</i>

00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:26,094
<i>Let me put your white-white hand</i>

215
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:30,166
<i>To my red heart.</i>

216
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,432
<i>My feelings, dreams and fantasies</i>

217
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:55,577
<i>Were again lit up in my heart
like a flame, -</i>

218
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,800
<i>In my battles with
the world bourgeoisie,</i>

219
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:04,285
<i>I earned a private life for myself.</i>

220
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:15,445
He left her after
Fifteen days of use,

221
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,309
Because she didn't have
Enameled leather shoes.

222
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,310
--Mayakovsky

223
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,802
<i>When you put, so trustingly,</i>

224
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:32,177
<i>Your little fingers into my palm,</i>

225
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:36,560
<i>You can't even imagine</i>

226
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:41,234
<i>That you put them into a fire.</i>

227
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:49,515
<i>It's impossible to live
without tenderness,</i>

228
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:54,678
<i>It's easy to ruin this tenderness.</i>

229
00:17:54,782 --> 00:18:01,963
<i>Let me love your
black-black eyes</i>

230
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:09,850
<i>With my ruby-red soul.</i>

231
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,223
- Why so late?
- Hi!

232
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,925
- Are you all set?
- Yes.

233
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,239
My boys are in a hurry,
so let's start.

234
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:29,380
But we first need to film
the "Dorm" episode.

235
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,836
Baby, we need to mount everything.

236
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:33,722
Stop, stop, stop!

237
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,243
Forgive me, comrades,
but I have to stop the action,

238
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:40,753
because there are two new
and very important characters.

239
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:46,739
One of them is Bochkin, who
chose the pseudonym Oleg Bayan.

240
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:51,707
He's a rascal, the ideologist of Prisypkin,
his "home-bred Mephistopheles".

241
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:55,847
A preacher of the
temptations of the elegant life.

242
00:18:56,055 --> 00:19:01,531
By the way, after the play "The Bedbug"
appeared, there was a scandal

243
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,550
around Bayan's name.

244
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:08,338
The fact is that then there was one
real character, I knew him personally,

245
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:12,268
he was a literary plagiarist
and a fake poet.

246
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:14,233
His name was Vadim Bayan.

247
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:19,050
Of course, this was also a pseudonym.
He was really named Sidorov.

248
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:23,741
So, this Sidorov accused Mayakovsky
of the charge that

249
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:27,072
Mayakovsky insulted his person.

250
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:29,809
He said that Oleg Bayan
in "The Bedbug"

251
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:35,478
had a lot of "parallels
and common features" with him.

252
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:39,502
Mayakovsky replied: "If you don't like it,
change your name".

253
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:43,802
This "Bochkin-Bayan" is played
by Leonid Sergeyevich Bronevoy.

254
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,696
To be precise,
he plays two roles:

255
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,760
He plays Oleg Bayan from
the "New Economic Policy" era

256
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,770
and the modern mediocre
actor Bochkin.

257
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:57,059
Galina Borisovna Volchek
also plays two roles.

258
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:01,370
At first she plays Madame Renaissance,
the future mother-in-law of Prisypkin.

259
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:02,885
from the "New Economic Policy" era.

260
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,710
And then she plays a mediocre actress
who performs with Bochkin.

261
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:10,444
They both voice themselves.

262
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:13,757
They voice their animated drawings,

263
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:16,724
because cinema has learned
how to give life to drawings,

264
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:20,026
but the drawings can't speak with
human voices themselves yet,

265
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,265
even now, in the era of the scientific
and technological revolution.

266
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:28,130
I apologize to the actors
for interrupting their acting,

267
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,430
and I ask them to start
the scene from the beginning.

268
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,686
Why so late?
Look at the clock!

269
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,281
- Hi! Are you all set?
- Yes.

270
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:40,925
Okay, my boys are in a hurry,
so let's start.

271
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,444
No, we first need to film
the "Dorm" episode.

272
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:45,225
Baby, we need to mount everything.

273
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,308
The boys today have
two more gigs.

274
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,550
So these puppeteers will wait.

275
00:20:50,654 --> 00:20:52,925
Give me the sheet music, baby!
Faster!

276
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,234
Faster!
Come on! Come on!

277
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,725
Instruments in order!
Tempo! Tempo!

278
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:03,077
What about you?
Warm up! I'll start...

279
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:05,247
Good, just not so loud.
I'll start the test.

280
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,848
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

281
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:14,286
Ma-ma! Ma-ma-mua!
1, 2, 3, 4!

282
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:15,536
Okay...

283
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:42,441
Attention, everyone get ready
for dubbing the animated episode "NEP"!

284
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,658
Complete silence!

285
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:58,228
Attention! Instrument room!
Projection! Action!

286
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:31,351
For the upcoming wedding
Prisypkin and Bayan

287
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:35,797
are making purchases using the money
of Madam Renaissance.

288
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:58,876
<i>You will find here
everything you want:</i>

289
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:05,079
<i>All you want for drinking
or for comfort.</i>

290
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:09,209
<i>Here, the old world is ready
to give itself up</i>

291
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:13,504
<i>For the new Soviet currency.</i>

292
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:21,796
<i>Oleg Bayan will arrange
everything just like in Paris,</i>

293
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:28,436
<i>Oleg Bayan advises you
with good intent:</i>

294
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:35,833
<i>Grab the piece that lies
closer to you,</i>

295
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,036
<i>So that nobody grabs it
before you.</i>

296
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:46,264
<i>Wait till you're my age, my dear.</i>

297
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:49,557
<i>They will deceive you many times -</i>

298
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,429
<i>Ask Madame Renaissance about it -</i>

299
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:56,364
<i>Because there are all sorts
of crooks at this place!</i>

300
00:23:56,572 --> 00:24:02,244
<i>All around is
wonderful private trade,</i>

301
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:05,428
<i>This is fair trade,
who will beat whom?</i>

302
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:09,676
<i>We don't need much
from friends or family -</i>

303
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,881
<i>No, we don't need too much!</i>

304
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,688
<i>Sometimes there are
militia raids,</i>

305
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:20,690
<i>But each of us has a license.</i>

306
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:25,009
<i>We are modest people
and if you pay,</i>

307
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:29,364
<i>We'll sell you everything, everything!</i>

308
00:24:29,572 --> 00:24:32,909
<i>Ah, those private sellers -
they are all crooks,</i>

309
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:36,122
<i>You won't even notice
how they will deceive you.</i>

310
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:44,145
<i>Trade without rest,
hike the price threefold,</i>

311
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,515
<i>As long as they pay,
as long as they pay!</i>

312
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:51,532
<i>And in this beautiful crush</i>

313
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:54,621
<i>You can see very clearly</i>

314
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:58,291
<i>The death throes of the class</i>

315
00:24:58,395 --> 00:25:04,617
<i>That has something to lose.
Has something to lose!</i>

316
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:24,002
<i>Lampshades! Lampshades!</i>

317
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:33,611
<i>Lampshades of any color and type.</i>

318
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,783
<i>Blue ones for comfort,</i>

319
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:42,091
<i>Red ones for passion.</i>

320
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:47,735
"Coty" perfume by the ounce!

321
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:53,455
"Coty" perfume by the ounce.

322
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:58,945
"Coty" perfume by the ounce.

323
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:07,194
Fur-lined brassieres!

324
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:10,797
Fur-lined brassieres!

325
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:15,953
Oh! Look at those
aristocratic bonnets!

326
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,850
They're not bonnets! They're...

327
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,527
Do you think I'm blind?

328
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:24,438
Suppose we have twins?

329
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:29,957
There'll be one for Dorothy,
and one for Lillian.

330
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:36,122
I've already decided to give them
aristocratic-cinematic names...

331
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:38,424
They will go out
together like that!

332
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,208
Yes! Buy them, Rosalia Pavlovna.

333
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,155
Comrade Skripkin...

334
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:45,957
Don't call me comrade!

335
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:49,053
You're not a proletarian yet -
not till after the marriage!

336
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:52,541
Buy them, buy them,
Rosalia Pavlovna.

337
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,790
He doesn't mean to be vulgar.

338
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:58,824
Here he is, bringing an immaculate
proletarian origin

339
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:02,967
and a union card into
your family

340
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:05,098
and you count your rubles!

341
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:12,090
<i>You shouldn't get married
because of a button!</i>

342
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:17,071
<i>You shouldn't get divorced
because of a button!</i>

343
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:22,026
<i>Just press your thumb against
your index finger</i>

344
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:30,186
<i>And you won't ever lose
your pants, citizens!</i>

345
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:35,707
Dutch press studs!
They sew themselves on!

346
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:37,773
Twenty kopeks for half a dozen!

347
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:39,876
Here you are, monsieurs!

348
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,859
Buy them, Rosalia Pavlovna.

349
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,936
In our Red family there must be
no petty bourgeois squabbles

350
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,203
over pant malfunctions.

351
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:54,653
And Comrade Prisypkin's pants
must be like a horn of plenty...

352
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:59,619
He is the victorious class and
he sweeps away everything in his path,

353
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:01,491
like lava!

354
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:03,992
Allow me to deliver it
at no extra charge.

355
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:14,574
<i>The best republican herrings!</i>

356
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:21,885
<i>Indispensable with every kind
of vodka!</i>

357
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,717
<i>Yes! Salted herrings!</i>

358
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:32,115
<i>Now that's something
for the wedding,</i>

359
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:39,181
<i>I'll sure take some of them.</i>

360
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:46,163
<i>How much is this sprat?</i>

361
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:51,558
<i>This salmon costs two-sixty
per kilo.</i>

362
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:55,153
<i>Two-sixty for this
overgrown minnow?</i>

363
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:59,980
<i>Only two-sixty for this
budding sturgeon!</i>

364
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:03,723
<i>For these marinated
fish bones?</i>

365
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:08,277
<i>For this real whale!</i>

366
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:11,982
<i>Two-sixty!</i>

367
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:14,828
<i>Two-sixty for this sprat?</i>

368
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:17,797
<i>Two-sixty!</i>

369
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,397
<i>For this overgrown minnow?</i>

370
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:23,119
<i>Two-sixty!</i>

371
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,729
<i>For these marinated
fish bones?</i>

372
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,578
<i>Did you hear that,
Comrade Skripkin?</i>

373
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:31,130
<i>Oh, how right you were</i>

374
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:35,090
<i>to kill the Tsar, our emperor!</i>

375
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:37,745
<i>Oh, how right you were</i>

376
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,459
<i>to drive out Mr. Ryabushinsky!</i>

377
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:46,551
<i>I shall claim my civic rights
and buy my herrings</i>

378
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:54,804
<i>in the Soviet State Co-Op!</i>

379
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:58,383
<i>The best republican herrings!</i>

380
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:06,136
<i>Indispensable with every kind
of vodka!</i>

381
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:17,595
Comrade Skripkin, why get mixed up
with these petty bourgeois elements

382
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:21,202
and haggle over herrings
so quarrelsomely?

383
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:32,253
<i>Don't you worry,</i>

384
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:37,855
<i>There's no reason to.</i>

385
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:40,989
<i>Just give me half a liter of vodka</i>

386
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:42,820
<i>And the tail of herring,</i>

387
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,686
<i>And fifteen more rubles...</i>

388
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:49,125
<i>Then the wedding
will be a success.</i>

389
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,631
<i>Yes!</i>

390
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:53,972
Comrade Bayan...

391
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:59,352
I'm against all this
petty bourgeois stuff -

392
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:01,971
like canaries, and so on...

393
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:05,765
I'm a man with higher needs.

394
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:10,905
What I'm interested in
is a wardrobe with a mirror...

395
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,106
There!

396
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:22,293
<i>Whales! Whales! Whales!
Dolphins!</i>

397
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:31,407
<i>Now then, show me your snail!</i>

398
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:36,143
<i>It's a whole tail's length longer!</i>

399
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:41,239
<i>A whole tail's length longer!</i>

400
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:44,621
<i>A whole tail's length longer?</i>

401
00:31:46,743 --> 00:31:49,423
<i>What did we fight for?</i>

402
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:54,261
<i>Oh, why did we kill the Tsar,
our emperor?</i>

403
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:57,074
<i>What did we fight for?</i>

404
00:31:57,178 --> 00:32:01,560
<i>Oh, why did we throw out
Mr. Ryabushinsky?</i>

405
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:04,850
<i>Where will I find my civic rights</i>

406
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:07,418
<i>and my herrings?</i>

407
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:13,995
<i>This Soviet regime of yours
will drive me to my grave!</i>

408
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:18,880
My dear Rosalia Pavlovna,
try comparing them from the other end.

409
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:20,996
It's only bigger by a head,

410
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,438
and what do you need the head for?
It's inedible.

411
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,011
You'll cut it off and throw it out!

412
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:26,393
Did you hear what he said?

413
00:32:26,497 --> 00:32:27,868
If I cut off your head,
Comrade Bayan,

414
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:30,389
it will be no loss to anyone.

415
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:33,063
But if I cut off this herring's head

416
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:38,369
I lose ten kopeks to the kilo!

417
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:42,677
<i>All around is
wonderful private trade,</i>

418
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:45,221
<i>This is fair trade,
who will beat whom?</i>

419
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:48,690
<i>We don't need much
from friends or family -</i>

420
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:52,078
<i>No, we don't need too much!</i>

421
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:54,919
<i>All around is
wonderful private trade,</i>

422
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,500
<i>But each of us is very honest.</i>

423
00:32:57,604 --> 00:33:00,790
<i>We are modest people
and if you pay,</i>

424
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:04,207
<i>We'll sell you everything,
everything!</i>

425
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:08,424
<i>We'll sell you everything,
everything!</i>

426
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,918
<i>We'll sell you everything!</i>

427
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,130
<i>Property. Theft. The Law...</i>

428
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:21,819
<i>is blind. Purchase. Sale.</i>

429
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:25,159
<i>New Economic Policy [NEP].</i>

430
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:28,305
<i>New Economic Policy [NEP].</i>

431
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:30,722
<i>New Economic Policy [NEP].</i>

432
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:43,382
"RED HOME LIFE"
DORM

433
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:47,038
Attention, get ready for shooting
the episode "Dorm".

434
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:48,522
Action!

435
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,024
Episode "Dorm", take one.

436
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,385
Puppeteers, action!

437
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:17,705
Where are my boots?

438
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,551
Someone's swiped
my boots again!

439
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:25,201
They're here. Prisypkin took them
to go see his lady-love, his she-camel.

440
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:29,134
The trash he leaves behind him
is kind of more refined nowadays.

441
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,284
It used to be empty beer-bottles
and fish-tails.

442
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,667
Shut your trap!

443
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,795
The kid buys a new tie and you curse him
like he was Ramsay MacDonald.

444
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,317
That's just what he is!

445
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:40,915
The new tie don't matter.

446
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:44,291
Trouble is that he's tied to the tie -
not the tie to him.

447
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,319
Friends, help me to conduct
a great experiment.

448
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:54,293
I use the latest techniques
to fight against absenteeism!

449
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,889
Today he quit his job.

450
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:00,675
He's marrying
the daughter of a barber.

451
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,657
Now his nails will be trimmed by
Mademoiselle Elzevira Renaissance.

452
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:07,547
Pretty cozy!

453
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:10,089
Maybe you just envy him?

454
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:13,191
Do you think you're Karl Liebknecht?

455
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:17,709
If someone beckons you,
you surely would leave too!

456
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:19,127
What a hero!

457
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:21,019
This isn't 1919 any more.

458
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:24,375
People want to live their
own lives now.

459
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:32,189
Attention, in a minute Prisypkin
should noisily awake!

460
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:50,868
Comrade Skripkin, don't pay
attention to these rude jokes;

461
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:54,265
they will only spoil the refined taste
that is awakening in you.

462
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:55,893
Who is this?

463
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:59,691
This is his teacher,
who taught him to do his hair.

464
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:03,903
He now teaches young people,
to write poetry and to dance...

465
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:06,452
and from some,
he just borrows money.

466
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:09,564
You have talent,
Comrade Skripkin!

467
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:14,126
But what with capitalist encirclement
and the building of socialism in one country

468
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,174
you have no place to let loose!

469
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:18,675
You need a world revolution,

470
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,896
you must break through
into Europe.

471
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:23,957
Once you've smashed
the world bourgeoisie,

472
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:26,917
you will delight the Moulin Rouge
and the Pantheon

473
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:31,239
with the beauty of your
bodily movements.

474
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:44,414
The most crucial step in life

475
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:48,653
is the first tango after
the nuptial ceremonies -

476
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:52,631
it should leave
a lifelong impression!

477
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:06,866
Well, take a few steps
with an imaginary lady.

478
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:11,147
That's right! Tread softly

479
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:15,999
as if on a moonlit night,
full of sadness and dreams...

480
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:22,166
...you're returning from a saloon.

481
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:30,503
<i>Oh, you are so beautiful,
my tango,</i>

482
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:38,228
<i>It's hard with people,
but it's easy with you.</i>

483
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:45,360
Don't wriggle your hind-parts!

484
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:49,426
You're supposed to be leading
your <i>mademoiselle</i>, not a pushcart!

485
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:53,064
I was just scratching myself.

486
00:37:55,525 --> 00:38:02,357
<i>Oleg Bayan knows women,
no doubt.</i>

487
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:08,764
<i>Oleg Bayan advises you
with good intent:</i>

488
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:15,586
<i>If you want to kiss us, do it
only after the engagement,</i>

489
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:22,123
<i>And if you do this before,
you'll only have yourselves to blame.</i>

490
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,369
Vanya, what happened?

491
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,098
So it's over?

492
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:45,073
Our love is liquidated.

493
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:48,706
"We part like ships in the sea..."

494
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:52,271
Van'ka, aren't you ashamed?

495
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:54,606
You need to leave this woman.

496
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:57,866
She's pulling your strings!

497
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,888
Vanya, what happened?

498
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:03,066
We wanted to live together!

499
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:05,257
We wanted to work together!

500
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:08,921
Don't interfere with my
freedom of love as a citizen,

501
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,944
otherwise I'll call the militia!

502
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:16,835
ZOYA BERYOZKINA
SHOT HERSELF

503
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:34,984
Don't be sad, Iya Sergeevna.

504
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:36,648
Zoya was clumsy in love,

505
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,209
and just as clumsy in suicide.

506
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:44,043
Therefore, in the second half of the film,
you'll meet your character again.

507
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:57,522
You should never forget:

508
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,894
don't put on two ties at once -

509
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,201
particularly if they're
different colors.

510
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:06,898
And remember,

511
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,276
you can't wear a starched shirt
outside your pants!

512
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:12,680
Especially for a wedding.

513
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:28,375
<i>The tramcars drew up
to the Registry Office,</i>

514
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:33,254
<i>Bringing the guests
to a Red marriage service.</i>

515
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:38,897
<i>Dressed in his working clothes
was the groom</i>

516
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:44,519
<i>And a union card stuck out
of his blouse!</i>

517
00:40:46,898 --> 00:40:51,429
<i>Ah, the guests are respectable
and prominent,</i>

518
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:52,366
<i>Prominent!</i>

519
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:56,261
<i>The mother-in-law is dignified
and imposing,</i>

520
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:57,377
<i>Imposing!</i>

521
00:40:57,481 --> 00:41:03,143
<i>The bride is rosy and drunk,</i>

522
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:04,649
<i>Drunk!</i>

523
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:09,552
<i>But not because of wine.</i>

524
00:42:10,922 --> 00:42:13,108
Let's begin, Skripochka?

525
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:18,343
Wait a little more.

526
00:42:20,476 --> 00:42:26,375
I wish to get wed in
an organized fashion -

527
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:29,739
in the presence
of the guests of honor,

528
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:35,622
and particularly in the presence
of the secretary of our factory committee,

529
00:42:37,018 --> 00:42:40,690
respected Comrade...

530
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:45,307
Lassalchenko.

531
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,586
There!

532
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:58,770
My dear bride and bridegroom,

533
00:42:58,874 --> 00:43:01,013
please forgive me
for being late

534
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:07,738
and allow me to convey to you
the congratulations of our leader,

535
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:11,574
Comrade Lassalchenko.

536
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,192
"Tomorrow, I'd even
go to church."

537
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:21,439
"But today is a Party meeting."

538
00:43:21,543 --> 00:43:27,653
"And like it or not, I have to go
to the Party cell..."

539
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:34,597
I hereby declare
the wedding open.

540
00:43:34,805 --> 00:43:38,731
Comrades and Monsieurs,
please eat!

541
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:42,107
Where would you find pigs
like these nowadays?

542
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:46,024
I bought this ham
three years ago

543
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:48,458
in case of a war
but there's still no war!

544
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:52,047
And the ham is getting moldy...

545
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,488
Please eat!

546
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:33,239
Respected citizens!

547
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,319
Beauty is the motive force
of progress!

548
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:44,765
What would I have been
as a simple worker?

549
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:48,266
"Bochkin" [Barrelman]
- and nothing more.

550
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:52,002
What could I do as a "Bochkin"?

551
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,216
Moo?

552
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:55,466
And nothing more.

553
00:44:55,674 --> 00:44:59,375
But as "Bayan" [epic bard]
I can do anything.

554
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:03,153
<i>I'm glad, I'm happy,</i>

555
00:45:03,257 --> 00:45:06,682
<i>We all are happy.</i>

556
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:10,346
<i>My friend Pierre Skripkin,</i>

557
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,915
<i>Our friend, our monsieur,</i>

558
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:17,857
<i>At this moment</i>

559
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,244
<i>Having walked
the path of struggle,</i>

560
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,765
<i>He lost only his union card</i>

561
00:45:26,973 --> 00:45:30,089
<i>But he found so much.</i>

562
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:35,139
<i>When we suffered being
under the yoke</i>

563
00:45:35,904 --> 00:45:39,319
<i>Together with the working class,</i>

564
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:44,006
<i>Together with Comrade
Friedrich Engels,</i>

565
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,370
<i>And with Comrade Marx,</i>

566
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:56,277
<i>Could we dreamily assume</i>

567
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:04,025
<i>Or at least assumedly dream,</i>

568
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:08,048
<i>That self-sacrificing work,</i>

569
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:13,154
<i>And defeated capital,</i>

570
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:16,852
<i>would be joined
in beautiful marriage?</i>

571
00:46:17,897 --> 00:46:23,900
<i>Oleg Bayan, everybody knows him,</i>

572
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:29,478
<i>Oleg Bayan, he doesn't need
to introduce himself.</i>

573
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:35,475
<i>Oleg Bayan,
such talent and charm!</i>

574
00:46:36,188 --> 00:46:41,031
<i>Pour him a glass
of champagne.</i>

575
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:45,614
Oleg Bayan is drunk
with happiness!

576
00:46:46,218 --> 00:46:48,460
Beauty is pregnant with...

577
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:52,854
Pregnant?
Who said "pregnant"?

578
00:46:53,817 --> 00:46:58,876
Watch your language in
the presence of the newlyweds!

579
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:07,061
A romance.

580
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:15,814
"Makarov's Lament for
Vera Kholodnaya".

581
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:29,846
<i>At a time when flowers
are being collected,</i>

582
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:39,243
<i>At a time when dreams
come true,</i>

583
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:48,549
<i>Tell me just one word,</i>

584
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:53,655
<i>And you will be
in my heart again,</i>

585
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:57,733
<i>Only you.</i>

586
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:18,048
<i>And you will be in my heart,</i>

587
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:24,778
<i>Only you.</i>

588
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:28,178
FIRE STATION

589
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:22,605
COMRADES AND CITIZENS,
VODKA IS POISON

590
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:25,656
DRUNKS CAN EASILY
BURN UP THE REPUBLIC

591
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,965
That's the end of the first part
of the film.

592
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:33,120
Everything burned down,

593
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:35,258
all that elegant life.

594
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:39,532
However, among the victims
there was no Prisypkin.

595
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:43,618
They decided that he had burned up
and forgot about him.

596
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:49,940
In fact, Prisypkin, along with his
seven-stringed "girlfriend"

597
00:50:50,044 --> 00:50:54,875
was soaked by fire hoses
and frozen into an icicle.

598
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,933
You'll see for yourselves
what happened next.

599
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,516
But for now, let's divulge
no more information,

600
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,229
and look around.

601
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,545
We're on Mayakovsky Square.

602
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:10,527
A person very quickly gets used
to the words.

603
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,615
Mayakovsky Square.

604
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:16,436
This is the holy place of Soviet art.

605
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:22,900
Here on the right,
where Tchaikovsky Hall now stands,

606
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:24,815
previously, there was "TM",

607
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:28,583
Theater of the famous
Soviet director Meyerhold,

608
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:32,011
who staged all the plays
of Mayakovsky.

609
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:36,513
If you look a little to the right,
there used to be a circus,

610
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:39,397
then a music hall, and now
it's the Satire Theater,

611
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:41,734
where you can watch
Mayakovsky's plays today.

612
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,645
And here, in the center of the square,

613
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:46,484
there was a simple tram stop.

614
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:49,844
In one direction along the
Garden Ring went "the Buggy",

615
00:51:49,948 --> 00:51:52,643
as it was called.
Tram "B".

616
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:56,041
And along Gorky St.,
the former Tverskaya-Yamskaya St.,

617
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:58,310
went other trams.

618
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,260
And there, opposite from here,
was their stop.

619
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:04,611
These trams had no doors

620
00:52:04,716 --> 00:52:07,623
so you could jump in at any time,
or jump out.

621
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:10,556
Trams were liberal, back then.

622
00:52:10,973 --> 00:52:12,975
On the Garden Ring
there were trees.

623
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:17,991
In fact, the entire Garden Ring
was a big single...

624
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:20,096
green boulevard.

625
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,953
And on this boulevard one could
often meet Mayakovsky

626
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:29,166
who was going to the Meyerhold Theate
for the rehearsals of his plays.

627
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:31,852
Actually, it was hard
to imagine Moscow

628
00:52:31,956 --> 00:52:36,597
without Mayakovsky,
who was walking its streets.

629
00:52:36,908 --> 00:52:39,629
He was tall,
taller than the rest.

630
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:42,233
Wide-shouldered,
wider than the rest.

631
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:47,117
He was a handsome,
very handsome man.

632
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:49,833
In "The Bedbug"
he wrote about the future,

633
00:52:49,938 --> 00:52:57,364
but even a genius can't imagine
the future in all of its reality.

634
00:52:57,468 --> 00:53:01,240
And he couldn't imagine
this Mayakovsky Square either.

635
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,583
Nor his monument.

636
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:06,311
It's known that Mayakovsky
didn't like monuments.

637
00:53:06,485 --> 00:53:09,961
But it's not he who needs
this monument, it's us.

638
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:13,144
And Mayakovsky definitely
couldn't imagine that

639
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:15,824
there'd be a "Mayakovskaya"
metro station.

640
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:20,397
"Are you exiting on the
'Mayakovskaya'?" - somebody may ask

641
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:23,884
as simply as he would have
asked in the 1920s:

642
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:26,326
"Hey, coachman,
to get to Sadovo-Triumphalnaya,

643
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,060
(i.e. the current
Mayakovsky Square)

644
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:29,329
how much?"

645
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:31,102
The station "Mayakovskaya".

646
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:52,503
<i>Above us is the Sun,
the Sun and the Sun.</i>

647
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:55,798
<i>Rejoice, all you who are strong,</i>

648
00:53:56,542 --> 00:54:00,488
<i>Workshop of the workers
who create our world.</i>

649
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:07,290
<i>Warm us, Sun!
Play, Sun!</i>

650
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,281
<i>Burn, our Sun!</i>

651
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:15,591
<i>Enthusiasm, go grow and expand!</i>

652
00:54:15,695 --> 00:54:18,808
<i>Factories, go shine iridescent!</i>

653
00:54:18,913 --> 00:54:22,731
<i>Today we are building socialism -</i>

654
00:54:22,835 --> 00:54:30,050
<i>It's alive, real, and true.</i>

655
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:37,573
<i>Warm us, Sun!</i>

656
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:41,316
<i>Play, Sun!</i>

657
00:54:41,842 --> 00:54:45,189
<i>Burn, our Sun!</i>

658
00:54:46,298 --> 00:54:49,663
THE FUTURE GENERATION
FINDS THE FROZEN PRISYPKIN

659
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:52,896
AND DECIDES TO RESURRECT HIM.

660
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:25,100
I've slept it off!

661
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:32,064
Forgive me, comrades,
I was plastered!

662
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:36,678
What militia station is this?

663
00:55:39,745 --> 00:55:44,342
I can always prove my identity.

664
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,747
I've got my documents with me.

665
00:56:06,002 --> 00:56:08,549
International Red Aid - paid.

666
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:12,311
OSOAVIAKhIM - paid!

667
00:56:13,374 --> 00:56:16,338
"Down With Illiteracy" -
here you are!

668
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,983
And what is this?

669
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:26,942
A marriage certificate...

670
00:56:29,505 --> 00:56:31,898
Right, I married yesterday.

671
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:36,821
Where are you? Who's kissing
your finger tips?

672
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:38,732
There'll be hell to pay
at home!

673
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:41,217
Here's my union card.

674
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:44,605
All my unpaid union dues!

675
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:45,781
What day is today?

676
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,602
The forms...

677
00:57:00,694 --> 00:57:02,460
They'll ask for the forms!

678
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:05,528
Local Committee...
District Committee...

679
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:08,271
My God!
My wife!

680
00:57:10,873 --> 00:57:12,291
Let me out of here!

681
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,418
Let me out of here!

682
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:19,752
Let me out of here!

683
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:26,761
Where am I?

684
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:28,853
Where did you put me?

685
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,557
Highways! Highways!
Coachman!

686
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:45,357
The highways of the future
amazed the defrozen mammal.

687
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:49,191
This pure example
of the petty bourgeoisie

688
00:57:49,556 --> 00:57:52,270
found himself in a new world.

689
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:07,920
Hello! Hello!

690
00:58:08,336 --> 00:58:12,163
This is the President of the Institute
for Human Resurrection.

691
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:15,029
I want to inform you
about new circumstances

692
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:17,725
relating to the amazing experiment

693
00:58:17,933 --> 00:58:21,394
of bringing a frozen creature
back to life.

694
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,971
I'll read the resolution!

695
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:28,322
Moved by sanitary-inspection
stations of the metallurgical

696
00:58:28,426 --> 00:58:31,385
and chemical enterprises
of the Donbass:

697
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:37,655
In view of the danger
of the spread of the bacteria

698
00:58:37,759 --> 00:58:40,295
of arrogance and sycophancy,

699
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:43,683
we demand that
the exhibit remain

700
00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:46,658
in its refrigerated state.

701
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,621
A word, please!

702
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:51,790
This is the opinion of
the majority of the members

703
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:53,846
of the Academic council
of our institute.

704
00:58:55,652 --> 00:58:57,147
The rapid passage of time

705
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:00,379
will sweep and cut away
all heavy ballast,

706
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:02,453
the ballast of those
devastated by unbelief.

707
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,755
The future will accept all those

708
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:07,291
who have at least one trait

709
00:59:07,395 --> 00:59:09,777
that ties the person
to the collective:

710
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:12,341
the joy of work,
the desire to sacrifice,

711
00:59:12,445 --> 00:59:14,338
the tireless urge to invent,

712
00:59:14,442 --> 00:59:18,754
the gift of generosity,
a pride in one's humanity.

713
00:59:19,672 --> 00:59:22,346
Going by its external
mimetic characteristics,

714
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:27,077
this ressurected mammal should be
classified under <i>homo sapiens</i>.

715
00:59:27,181 --> 00:59:30,540
My colleague Dr. Beryozkina
is mistaken.

716
00:59:30,816 --> 00:59:33,668
Utilizing the method of
comparative zoology,

717
00:59:33,772 --> 00:59:36,816
I have become convinced that
we're dealing with...

718
00:59:37,518 --> 00:59:40,978
a most dangerous
anthropoid simulant.

719
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:43,155
And that this is...

720
00:59:43,508 --> 00:59:45,672
the most remarkable of parasites.

721
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,550
In the not too distant time,
in the mattresses of time

722
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:51,510
there were always two types.

723
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:55,695
They're different in size,
but identical in essence:

724
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:58,657
the famous <i>bedbugus normalis</i>

725
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,823
and <i>bourgeoisius vulgaris</i>.

726
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:04,361
The difference between
them was only that

727
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:09,914
<i>bedbugus normalis</i>, having gorged
itself on the body of a human,

728
01:00:10,018 --> 01:00:11,667
fell under the bed.

729
01:00:11,771 --> 01:00:17,132
And <i>bourgeoisius vulgaris</i> having gorged
itself on the body of all mankind,

730
01:00:17,236 --> 01:00:19,120
fell onto the bed.

731
01:00:41,081 --> 01:00:44,591
Give me a drink...

732
01:00:44,695 --> 01:00:46,959
I made you breakfast.

733
01:00:49,648 --> 01:00:55,105
We give this only to cosmonauts
and investigators of the sea depths.

734
01:00:55,209 --> 01:00:58,106
Try it.
It's very delicious.

735
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:03,369
I don't need your breakfast!

736
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:12,201
Give me a drink, please.

737
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:15,838
It's good that I envisaged
this relapse.

738
01:01:20,422 --> 01:01:23,007
Cognac "Cosmos".

739
01:01:23,454 --> 01:01:28,800
It gives you energy, and has
the same taste as the French "Napoleon".

740
01:01:28,904 --> 01:01:32,586
You can drink it at work and when
you're sunbathing by the sea.

741
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:35,721
One hundred percent lack of alcohol.

742
01:01:40,034 --> 01:01:42,039
Like giving lemonade
to an elephant.

743
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,928
You ressurect me and now
you make fun of me!

744
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:50,849
Give me a drink!

745
01:01:52,247 --> 01:01:55,632
Give me a drink!

746
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:01,499
Indeed, this is an amazing parasite.

747
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,828
The dispute about his future fate
engaged not only the scientists,

748
01:02:07,036 --> 01:02:09,352
but also me and
directors of this film.

749
01:02:09,633 --> 01:02:13,894
There was something of a
confrontation between us.

750
01:02:14,723 --> 01:02:17,289
The thing is that in "The Bedbug"
everything ends as follows:

751
01:02:17,393 --> 01:02:19,826
the people of the future,
that is - me and you,

752
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:24,211
put this anthropoid creature
into a zoo cage.

753
01:02:25,294 --> 01:02:28,830
And I thought that this is how
this film should end.

754
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:32,370
However, the directors decided
to transfer Prisypkin to that world

755
01:02:32,474 --> 01:02:35,582
where there is an elegant
life even today,

756
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:40,548
and where there's a larder for
people such as Skripkin and Bochkin.

757
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:43,896
In response to my doubts,
they cited Mayakovsky,

758
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,041
who really did say that he would
insert into the play

759
01:02:48,145 --> 01:02:52,317
"Facts about the philistinistic bastards
of the past and the future."

760
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:55,843
"Recent political and domestic news".

761
01:02:56,051 --> 01:02:59,797
Everyone knows who has the final say in a film.
The directors.

762
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,463
And they decided to do it
their own way.

763
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:02,980
I'm not responsible for it.

764
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:14,433
GIVE US AN ELEGANT LIFE
(PART TWO)

765
01:04:55,752 --> 01:04:57,827
Give me...!

766
01:05:01,503 --> 01:05:03,553
Give me...!

767
01:05:10,557 --> 01:05:12,740
...a drink!

768
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:06,441
DING DING DING

769
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:19,342
BANG! BANG! BANG!

770
01:06:40,972 --> 01:06:45,217
Gorblimey! Can't decide
what to choose from all this...

771
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:38,354
HOUSE OF MIRRORS

772
01:09:17,898 --> 01:09:20,507
BANQUET HALL

773
01:11:09,834 --> 01:11:14,596
RELICT MAMMAL
THE SO-CALLED LOCH NESS MONSTER

774
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,928
BIRTHPLACE: SCOTLAND

775
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:13,904
A rollie, huh?

776
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,277
Marijuana

777
01:13:58,353 --> 01:14:01,147
DIOGENES

778
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:10,242
THE BEST REMEDY

779
01:14:11,802 --> 01:14:14,561
FOR HAIR GROWING

780
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:32,617
<i>Listen to me, brothers,
the truth is like a garment:</i>

781
01:14:32,825 --> 01:14:40,724
<i>It should be convenient
and fit just right.</i>

782
01:14:40,932 --> 01:14:49,764
<i>Christ and Buddha
are no longer trendy,</i>

783
01:14:49,972 --> 01:14:55,006
<i>Only Diogenes!
Only Diogenes -</i>

784
01:14:55,719 --> 01:14:59,753
<i>Is just right for us.</i>

785
01:15:01,321 --> 01:15:06,489
<i>He proclaimed:
Let's go back to nature!</i>

786
01:15:06,697 --> 01:15:10,426
<i>And to hell with
all the bustle around.</i>

787
01:15:12,052 --> 01:15:14,835
<i>I'll live in a barrel, but I'll be free,</i>

788
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,857
<i>And let my hair grow long!</i>

789
01:15:17,482 --> 01:15:20,180
<i>I'll live in a barrel, but I'll be free,</i>

790
01:15:20,284 --> 01:15:22,026
<i>And let my hair grow long!</i>

791
01:15:22,547 --> 01:15:27,378
<i>And we also have to
live this way.</i>

792
01:15:27,586 --> 01:15:31,381
<i>Brothers, our time has come!</i>

793
01:15:32,714 --> 01:15:35,332
<i>And other classes, bosses
and masses,</i>

794
01:15:35,436 --> 01:15:37,241
<i>May grow bald without us!</i>

795
01:15:38,013 --> 01:15:40,418
<i>And other classes, bosses
and masses,</i>

796
01:15:40,522 --> 01:15:42,320
<i>May grow bald without us!</i>

797
01:15:42,424 --> 01:15:46,250
<i>Hasten to buy
the elixir "Diogenes" -</i>

798
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:50,675
<i>And your hair will
grow to your knees!</i>

799
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:52,276
DIOGENES

800
01:15:53,029 --> 01:15:56,761
<i>I'll sing, enraptured,
and begin to cry.</i>

801
01:15:56,866 --> 01:16:00,561
<i>When you're with me,
I become drunk without wine.</i>

802
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:04,735
<i>It's impossible to escape
from fate with laughter,</i>

803
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,249
<i>As soon as I touch these strings,
you'll be mine.</i>

804
01:16:08,353 --> 01:16:12,215
<i>We live once and die once,</i>

805
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:16,194
<i>Kiss me and don't be sad,
why should we get married?</i>

806
01:16:16,298 --> 01:16:19,739
<i>All the horses left,
they raced away,</i>

807
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:23,741
<i>I'm at the saloon and
the sadness eats my soul.</i>

808
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:27,466
<i>Hey, beautiful,
wait a little bit,</i>

809
01:16:34,888 --> 01:16:38,658
<i>Let me get a drink
and I'll be yours.</i>

810
01:16:38,763 --> 01:16:42,304
<i>I'll sing, enraptured,
and begin to cry.</i>

811
01:16:42,408 --> 01:16:45,865
<i>When you're with me,
I become drunk without wine.</i>

812
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:49,453
<i>I'll sing, enraptured,
and you'll be mine!</i>

813
01:16:49,557 --> 01:16:52,726
<i>Let's all have another round!</i>

814
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,970
<i>Let's all have another round!</i>

815
01:17:07,265 --> 01:17:10,867
<i>Oh, you horses,
falcon-horses!,</i>

816
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:14,752
<i>How far have you
ridden away from me?</i>

817
01:17:14,856 --> 01:17:18,730
<i>Oh, you horses,
are you far or near?</i>

818
01:17:30,255 --> 01:17:33,223
<i>Let's all have another round!</i>

819
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:36,550
<i>Let's all have another round!</i>

820
01:17:37,818 --> 01:17:41,589
<i>We live once and die once...</i>

821
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:46,668
Come on, sing it!

822
01:17:51,108 --> 01:17:58,400
<i>Kiss me and don't be sad,
why should we get married?</i>

823
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:09,757
You have talent,
citizen Skripkin!

824
01:18:10,915 --> 01:18:15,954
However, in the conditions of the socialist
system, you have no place to let loose.

825
01:18:16,856 --> 01:18:20,269
You must break through
into Europe.

826
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,070
Klak! Flash!

827
01:18:24,871 --> 01:18:26,771
PRESS CONFERENCE

828
01:18:28,306 --> 01:18:30,710
Gentlemen of the press,

829
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:36,210
Let me introduce you
to Mr. Skripkin.

830
01:18:52,299 --> 01:18:57,105
He fled from
the socialist paradise.

831
01:18:58,146 --> 01:19:05,052
And as a statement of protest against
the oppression of the free individual...

832
01:19:05,947 --> 01:19:10,994
changed the vulgar name "Ivan"

833
01:19:12,085 --> 01:19:16,486
into the more melodious "Pierre".

834
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:29,300
I'm pleased to announce to you

835
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:34,377
that Mr. Skripkin has signed a contract

836
01:19:34,481 --> 01:19:37,298
with our famous firm,

837
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:43,247
and now he will sing
to the glory of "Diogenes"

838
01:19:43,455 --> 01:19:47,659
and the entire free world!

839
01:21:45,888 --> 01:21:49,184
Comrades! Citizens!

840
01:21:49,473 --> 01:21:50,932
Brothers!

841
01:21:51,275 --> 01:21:53,261
I'm one of you!

842
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:57,609
<i>We all are parts of one folk...!</i>

843
01:22:04,783 --> 01:22:05,956
Gentlemen!

844
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:07,768
Misters!

845
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:09,999
Monsieurs!

In my play, a person who forcefully
breaks away from his class
