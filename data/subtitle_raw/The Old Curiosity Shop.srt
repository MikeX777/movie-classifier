1
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,971
Here she comes. Not a second late.

2
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:14,538
Lead us please.
- Carry on.

3
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:16,431
Wheel us left.
- Right.

4
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,960
Old Charlie is keeping up his record.

5
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,150
Alright behind.

6
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,315
Going away.

7
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:08,690
That's new since my day.

8
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,459
The Bristol Mail, sir.

9
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:13,968
She takes only eleven and
3/4 hours from London.

10
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,051
She's the fastest coach on the road.

11
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:17,818
Under forty seconds again.

12
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:21,052
Our stage has never let
Her Majesty's mail down yet.

13
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:22,762
You have been away long?

14
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:24,984
Abroad for 40 years.
- Oh.

15
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,322
And I have done pretty well for myself.

16
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:30,844
I've made a tidy fortune and
no-one to share it with me.

17
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,463
No relatives in England?

18
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:34,755
Well, that's what I have
come home to find out.

19
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:35,974
[ Horn ]

20
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,440
I had an elder brother.

21
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,788
He may be dead for all I know.

22
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:46,446
You have heard nothing of him?

23
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,305
All these years?
- Not a word.

24
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:51,888
You see, sir. We quarrelled.

25
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,914
We both loved the same woman.

26
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,216
And he won her.

27
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,854
Do you know where to look for him?

28
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:01,835
I'm to begin my search in London.

29
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,522
He may have children living.

30
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:08,080
And perhaps there may
be one among them ..

31
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,315
Who is like her.

32
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:13,129
With her eyes.

33
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:15,890
And her voice.

34
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:19,834
When you read to me I think
it is my Erin come back.

35
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,282
You're so like her.

36
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,604
She made you happy.

37
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,829
To remember her <i>is</i> to be happy.

38
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:28,974
[ Bell ]

39
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:31,405
Eight o'clock.

40
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,002
He should be here by now.

41
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:35,310
But he won't fail me.

42
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,987
Has Kit closed the shop?
- No. I'll tell him.

43
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:41,637
I expect he's still doing the
writing lesson I gave him.

44
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:48,864
Kit.
- Yes, Miss Nell?

45
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,914
I've written my exercise. Look.

46
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,200
Oh Kit.

47
00:04:58,251 --> 00:04:59,553
I am sorry, Kit.

48
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:02,728
Now put up the shutters and I'll
get your supper before you go.

49
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:04,065
Thank you, Miss Nell.

50
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:29,108
Poor Kit. I'm afraid he'll
never learn to write.

51
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,549
I like to see you smile, my dear.

52
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:35,159
I'm afraid I'm sad company for you.
- Oh no.

53
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,520
But if only you weren't so worried.

54
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:39,717
It will only be for a
little while longer, Nell.

55
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,454
Soon, you shall be rich. Very rich.

56
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,690
But it is late.

57
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,309
He doesn't come.
- Who is coming?

58
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,172
Quilp, my dear.

59
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,577
Ain't you pleased to see him?

60
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:53,527
You're late. You've kept me waiting.

61
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:54,942
Now come, come.

62
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,456
That's not the way to
treat an old friend.

63
00:05:57,716 --> 00:06:00,140
And such a very obliging friend.

64
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,494
How are you, Nelly?
- Very well, sir.

65
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:05,269
Upon my soul, she gets
prettier every day.

66
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:07,315
Nell. Take Kit his supper.

67
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:18,438
You brought what I asked?
- Yes.

68
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:28,283
Give it to me! Give it to me.

69
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,106
Give it here.

70
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,774
You got it.
- Oh.

71
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,587
Ah, you old miser.

72
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,302
I swear you'll make that grow
in your hands, won't you.

73
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,992
Yes. It will grow.

74
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:39,989
How will you do it, eh?

75
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,876
Short loans at high interest?

76
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,264
Speculation?

77
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:44,984
What's your security?

78
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,552
Tell a friend.

79
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:48,158
No. You must wait.

80
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,463
You will get it back. A hundredfold.

81
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,617
Never fear.

82
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:53,928
If I had any fear I wouldn't
have brought that.

83
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,719
Do you know what they call you?

84
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,477
The richest man in London.

85
00:06:57,874 --> 00:06:58,518
Rich?

86
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:01,443
Yes. I will put her beyond
the reach of want.

87
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:04,463
She will have no pittance but a fortune.

88
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:06,886
And a fortune for me too, eh?

89
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:09,153
Yes. For you too. If you will wait.

90
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,240
Oh, I'll wait. But you are deep.

91
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,860
You keep your secret close.

92
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:16,851
Yes. Very close.

93
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:21,839
What do you think I have in my pocket?

94
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,200
Put there quite by mistake I assure you.

95
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:28,661
A certain mortgage on a certain shop.

96
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:29,977
A shop ..?

97
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:32,999
Just between friends, of course.

98
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,731
Now, you won't forget that.

99
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:37,170
Will you.

100
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,146
It isn't the big words, Miss.
It's the little-uns.

101
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,136
Now what is an 'ee-wee' lamb?

102
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,750
A 'ewe' lamb, Kit.
Why, it's a little girl lamb.

103
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,380
Like you, Nelly!

104
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,116
Sure. Give me a kiss
for Mrs Quilp, Nelly.

105
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,778
You get out or I'll bash your ugly face.

106
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,675
Oh, you will, will you?

107
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:01,786
Ha-ha-ha.

108
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:09,102
Be a good girl, Nelly.

109
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:12,046
And perhaps one day you shall
come to tea with Mrs Quilp.

110
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,349
With <i>Mrs</i> Quilp.

111
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,382
Before Quilp and I were married.

112
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:24,234
Mother often said he had such a way with
him, he could marry anyone he pleased.

113
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,510
Didn't you, mother?
- Did I?

114
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,421
Anyway, he has no right
to treat you as he does.

115
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:30,652
Mrs Quilp.

116
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,083
Before I would let a man order me about
as your husband does I'd kill myself.

117
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,866
And write a letter first
to say he had done it.

118
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,381
Quilp is the greatest
tyrant that ever lived.

119
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,621
My poor daughter can't
call her soul her own.

120
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:46,576
Why don't you stand up to him, my dear?

121
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,499
She hasn't the spirit
to answer him back.

122
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:50,418
No, not a single word.

123
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:00,225
What? Not going, ladies?

124
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,507
Not going, surely?

125
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:05,675
Why not stop to supper?

126
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:09,717
Why shouldn't they stay to supper
Quilp, if my daughter was to ask them?

127
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:11,999
To be sure. Why not?

128
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,257
Oh. You look ill, Mrs Jiniwin.

129
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:18,056
You've been overexciting
yourself with talking.

130
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,237
It is your weakness.

131
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:21,933
Go to bed.

132
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:24,676
I shall go to bed when I please.

133
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,578
Then please go now.

134
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,349
Mrs Quilp.

135
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:43,665
Yes, Quilp?

136
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,635
If ever you ask any of
these women here again.

137
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,393
I will .. bite you.

138
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:51,609
Fetch my cigars.

139
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,886
Yes, Quilp.

140
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:10,213
Mrs Quilp.

141
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,236
I have a problem to think out.

142
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,399
I shall smoke all night.

143
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:16,231
Sit there in case I want you.

144
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:17,868
Yes, Quilp.

145
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,411
I've got to find out what he does
with that money, the sly old fox.

146
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:36,843
Hello gentlemen. Are you still game?

147
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,704
Yes, yes. My luck will change.

148
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:40,961
Of course it will.
- That's the spirit.

149
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:42,057
I must win.

150
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:43,938
I must win for her sake.

151
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,582
Don't go to sleep, Mrs Quilp.

152
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,749
Sit up. If you please.

153
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,262
Nell.

154
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:34,213
Nell. You must go at once
with a message for Mr Quilp.

155
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,674
It is urgent.

156
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,234
My dear me, it is daylight.

157
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,994
Unlock the door, Mrs Quilp.

158
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,173
Good heavens.

159
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:55,785
You don't mean to say that she was ..?
- Yes, she has been.

160
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:57,219
Sitting up all night.

161
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:01,147
Now, who can say that husband
and wife ain't pleasant company?

162
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,128
Oh, you are a brute.

163
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,258
Bless you.

164
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,109
My dear old lady.

165
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:12,210
Get my breakfast.

166
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:26,763
You're so fond of me, aren't you?

167
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:27,743
Oh, you ..

168
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,064
You.

169
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:31,083
You dear old darling.

170
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:49,556
Why, it's Nellie.

171
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:52,436
What is it, sweetness?

172
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,273
A letter from my grandfather, sir.

173
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,096
Oh.

174
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,544
Just a moment, my dear.
I will let you in.

175
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,034
Nelly Trent is here.

176
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:10,208
Again.

177
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:13,272
See if you can get anything out
of her about her grandfather ..

178
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,883
And what he does with the money.

179
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,784
I, Quilp?
- Yes, you.

180
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:17,948
Of course.

181
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:21,132
You will talk more freely to one
another than you do to us.

182
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:24,684
Worm your way into her secrets.

183
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:27,883
Oh Quilp, I don't like to.
I am fond of the child.

184
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:29,726
Well, so much the better.

185
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,586
Oh.

186
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,905
I will.

187
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:33,031
Yes.

188
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:38,137
Now remember. I shall be listening.

189
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,940
If you're not sharp enough
I shall creak the door.

190
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:45,207
Woe betide you if I
have to creak it often.

191
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,832
What? Gone in four and twenty hours?

192
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,142
What the devil does
he do with the money?

193
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:11,945
That's the mystery.

194
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:13,831
Ah.

195
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,756
Come in, my dear.

196
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:18,085
Come in and see Mrs Quilp.

197
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,983
Pretty little Nelly.

198
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,449
How would you like to be my second?

199
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,610
Be your what, sir?

200
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,948
Mrs Quilp the second.

201
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,944
When Mrs Quilp the first is dead.

202
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,719
Sweet Nelly.

203
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:37,542
Be a good girl.

204
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:40,943
In five years you will be just
the proper age for me.

205
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:47,583
Here is Nelly Trent, my dear.

206
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:51,432
Give her a nice cup of tea
while I think out a reply.

207
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:02,138
Surely, you must have
left home very early?

208
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,972
Yes, ma'am. Soon after it was light.

209
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,709
Sugar?
- Thank you, ma'am.

210
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,622
Your grandfather.

211
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,030
Is he well?

212
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:13,720
I'm unhappy about him.

213
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,904
Unhappy, my dear?

214
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:17,146
How is that?

215
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:19,190
He seems to have changed lately.

216
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:20,476
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,077
Thank you. You're always kind to me.

218
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,837
How that door creaks.

219
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,546
It's only ..

220
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,179
The wind, my dear.

221
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:41,655
In what way has your
grandfather changed?

222
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,838
He used to be so cheerful and contented.

223
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:48,230
But now even the house
seems dark and gloomy.

224
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,413
I know you won't tell anyone.

225
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,455
But every night and all night
long he's away from home.

226
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,141
Indeed, my dear?

227
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:59,746
And in the early morning he comes
back so sad and wretched ..

228
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:02,920
What shall I do?
Tell me, what shall I do?

229
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,746
You can go home my dear.

230
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:08,526
Tell your grandfather I'm afraid
I can't oblige him today.

231
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:10,487
I was to bring back a note.

232
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,408
I'll see him tomorrow or the next day.

233
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:15,369
He said it was urgent.
- Hmm. So it is, my dear.

234
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:18,148
But the note?
- You give him my message.

235
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:19,721
Goodbye, Nellie.

236
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:21,026
Goodbye.

237
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,345
Well, Mrs Quilp.

238
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,459
You are a keen questioner.

239
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:31,731
Ain't you?

240
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,218
I did my best for you.
- Ha.

241
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:37,488
You may thank your lucky stars ..

242
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:40,093
That what I have heard has put
me on the object of my strike.

243
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,647
Don't get anything too tasty for dinner.

244
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:49,319
Because I shan't be home.

245
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,102
If anyone wants me I am at
the counting house at the wharf.

246
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:11,476
You dog!

247
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:15,411
If you stand on your head
again I'll cut your feet off.

248
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:21,891
There's a gent waiting inside for you.

249
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,917
Who is it?
- Mr Swiveller.

250
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:24,891
Ha.

251
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,619
Well, don't you leave the wharf or
I'll scratch you with a rusty nail.

252
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,200
You dog.

253
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:45,409
What devil's wind blows you here?

254
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,909
Sir, you must excuse the
iniquities of this attire.

255
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:51,809
But I had the sun strong
in my eyes last night.

256
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,527
That's evident. What do you want?

257
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,940
Man wants but little here below.

258
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,350
Nor wants that little long.
- Bah.

259
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,264
The fact is my aunt in Dorsetshire
has failed to send me a remittance.

260
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:02,195
Again?

261
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:04,060
And so sir, the watchword is .. four.

262
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,840
What?
- Four pounds.

263
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,517
So you want me to advance
you more money?

264
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,657
I'll pay you as soon
as the old lady dies.

265
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:12,427
And when will that be?

266
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,179
Well, she has been going
to die since I was 8 years old.

267
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:17,892
She hasn't kept her promise yet.

268
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:21,157
Well, I'm not lending any more
money on those expectations of yours.

269
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:21,932
Oh.

270
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,316
But.

271
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,922
I <i>may</i> get you into an office.

272
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:29,030
With a lawyer friend of mine.

273
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:33,012
Where you can keep an eye
on me and my expectations.

274
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:34,795
But aren't you going to fork out now?

275
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:36,884
There's a little job
I've got for you first.

276
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:38,443
You know old Trent?

277
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,393
The miser who keeps
the Old Curiosity Shop?

278
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:41,202
Yes.

279
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:43,214
He may help you to your fortune.

280
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,799
My fortune?

281
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:45,802
How?

282
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,889
Follow him and tell me
where he goes at night.

283
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,362
Smart is the word.
- And smart is the deed.

284
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,506
I was thinking of
calling to see old Trent.

285
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:58,571
But I'll delay my visit until you
find out what I want to know.

286
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,246
Say not another syllable. I know my cue.

287
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:22,370
Two days.

288
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,356
Two whole days and he doesn't come.

289
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,830
And if he deserts me now.

290
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:31,574
What can I do?

291
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,763
Grandfather, couldn't
we go away from here?

292
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:38,111
Let's forget about money and be happy.

293
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:42,257
We could go away to country places
and sleep in fields and under trees.

294
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,896
And never think of money again.

295
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,301
Or anything that makes you unhappy.

296
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:49,971
I could beg for us both.

297
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,582
My dear Nell.

298
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,460
My darling.

299
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:56,511
Who?

300
00:19:57,138 --> 00:19:57,833
Who?

301
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,766
How did you get in?
- Ha.

302
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,362
Through the door of course.

303
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,417
I'm not quite small enough
to get through keyholes.

304
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:05,871
I wish I was.

305
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:09,151
I want to have a quiet talk with you.

306
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:10,687
Alone.

307
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:11,847
Yes, yes.

308
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,499
Leave us, my dear.

309
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:14,644
Leave us.

310
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,253
You have no secret from me now.

311
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,997
I know where the money
I lent you has gone.

312
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:32,330
I thought you were
making a fortune for me.

313
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:36,621
Ann all the time I have been
cheated by a common gambler.

314
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,082
I am no gambler.

315
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,036
I never play for my own gain.

316
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,835
It is all .. for her.

317
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:46,353
You are mad.
- I have saved so little.

318
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,899
Not enough to keep her when I'm gone.

319
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,441
I couldn't bear to leave her in poverty.

320
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:53,706
So first you lost your savings.

321
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:55,455
And then you came to me.

322
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,462
And now .. you're a beggar.

323
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,685
I hold security on all that you have.

324
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:03,711
The shop and everything in it.
- I can win it all back.

325
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:04,816
Oh yes?

326
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,827
If a man plays long enough
he's sure to win.

327
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:07,829
So he is.

328
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:09,972
So he is. I felt that from the first.

329
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,739
I have dreamt three times ..

330
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,736
Of winning large sums.

331
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,406
My luck is going to change.

332
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,229
I believe it is indeed.

333
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:18,649
A good friend.

334
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:20,727
This time.

335
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,078
I must win.

336
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,285
I only want a little help.

337
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:26,589
Just a few pounds.

338
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,760
So, just a few pounds?

339
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,334
No. I really couldn't.

340
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:33,826
Two shillings.

341
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:35,583
Not a penny.

342
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:36,775
And what's more.

343
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,451
You're going to pay back every
farthing that you've borrowed.

344
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:41,603
I can't. Not yet. You know I can't.

345
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:44,909
The sale of your shop will bring
me in something on account.

346
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:46,816
What? You won't sell me out?

347
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,570
To be sure I will.

348
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,484
I'll ruin you.

349
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,417
I'll have you shut up in a
madhouse you old dotard.

350
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,349
Locked up. Chained up.

351
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,833
Put where you can't cheat
any more honest men.

352
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,671
No, no. No.

353
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:01,519
They will starve you.

354
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,005
They'll flog you.

355
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,851
And you will never get out.
You will never get out.

356
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:08,712
You will stay in there until you die.

357
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,014
It's Nell.

358
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,303
Grandfather, it's Nell.

359
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,961
Smoke away, you dog.

360
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,456
Is it good, Brass?

361
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,438
Is it nice? Is it fragrant?

362
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:40,772
It's famous.

363
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,274
This ought to keep off fever.

364
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:45,635
How long have we got to
stop here, Mr Quilp?

365
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:49,740
Until the old gentleman
upstairs is dead Mr Brass.

366
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:51,883
How kind of you sir, to wait.

367
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:55,246
Some people would sell off the goods
the very instant the law allowed them.

368
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:58,131
Some people would have been
all flintiness and granite.

369
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:00,220
Some people jabber like parrots.

370
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,163
Hee-hee. Such spirit.

371
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,443
Such a genial personality.

372
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:07,727
Here is my duck of diamonds.

373
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:09,741
How is he now?

374
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:11,656
A little better, thank you.

375
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:13,248
What a pretty Nellie.

376
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:17,749
Does she want to sit on
Quilp's knee or on Mr Brass's?

377
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,345
Oh no, no.

378
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,147
He is a very clever lawyer.

379
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,825
What a remarkably pleasant
way he has with children.

380
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:26,134
I only want a few things out of my room.

381
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,909
Then I won't come down here anymore.

382
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:42,700
Isn't yours a pretty
little room, Nellie.

383
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,264
Quite a bower.

384
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,175
I think I will take it
for my little room.

385
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:11,664
It was kind of you sir to spend so much
time in helping me in my search.

386
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:13,722
I wish you had stayed longer in London.

387
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,210
I'm only sorry we had so little success.

388
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:17,684
Oh, I have not lost hope.

389
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,582
There are plenty of people by
the name of Trent in London.

390
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:22,156
I shall continue my search.

391
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:33,393
Take your seats please.

392
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:37,666
Well. Godspeed and success
in your new work.

393
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,028
A school of my own.
And thirty-five pounds a year.

394
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,550
It is a fortune.
I can hardly believe it.

395
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,791
Come along, please.

396
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,110
We must keep in touch.

397
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,330
Write to me care of my bankers.

398
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,343
Coutts in The Strand.
- Thanks. I will.

399
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:07,496
The sun is just up.

400
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:10,840
It's going to be a fine day
for the start of our journey.

401
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:13,496
We must go at once.
- Are you sure you're strong enough?

402
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:16,049
I shall be strong when
we get away from here.

403
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:18,826
Far away.

404
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,957
Where he can't find me.

405
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:24,009
No-one must know who we are.

406
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,047
He said he would have me shut up.

407
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:30,449
Then they would take me away from you.

408
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:26,066
Which way?

409
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,956
I feel as if we have left all
of our troubles behind us.

410
00:26:47,393 --> 00:26:48,768
Yes. We can be free now.

411
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:50,755
And never go back there again.

412
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,002
Never.

413
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:55,597
We must keep even our name
secret so that they cannot find us.

414
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:57,842
You won't leave me, Nell?

415
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,512
If I lost you, who would
save me from him?

416
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,447
You're quite safe now, dear.

417
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:03,623
Not yet.

418
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:05,844
We must go on.

419
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:07,552
Further away.

420
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:14,775
They've gone, Brass. Gone, I tell you.

421
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,453
They've vanished.
- Impossible.

422
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,845
They think they can give
me the slip, do they?

423
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,348
Well, we will see.

424
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,175
[ Bell ringing ]

425
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:25,593
That's my sweet wife.

426
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,316
Later.

427
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:32,916
Does a Mr Trent live there?

428
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,402
Yes, sir.
- Oh.

429
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,194
What the devil are you doing?

430
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:48,247
Well, I hoped it was somebody else.

431
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:52,317
Hey, who did that?

432
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:54,489
He did.

433
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:56,039
Most un-businesslike.

434
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,898
I wish to see Mr Trent.

435
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:59,904
Won't you step in, sir?

436
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,517
After you, Mrs Quilp.

437
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,644
At last.

438
00:28:22,906 --> 00:28:23,922
Where is Mr Trent?

439
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:26,701
That I couldn't tell you sir, offhand.

440
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:28,717
Why? Doesn't Mr Trent live here?

441
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:30,354
Isn't this his shop?
- It was.

442
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,641
It's mine now.

443
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:33,655
Yours? You mean you bought it?

444
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:35,467
No. Not exactly.

445
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:37,234
But he owes me so much money.

446
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,561
That I was obliged,
but very reluctantly.

447
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:42,304
To sell the old man up.
- Sell him up?

448
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:43,960
Good gracious.

449
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:45,603
How old is he?

450
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,678
Upwards of seventy, I should say.

451
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:49,984
I gave them every consideration.

452
00:28:50,222 --> 00:28:51,933
Them? Has he a family?

453
00:28:52,304 --> 00:28:53,234
His grandchild.

454
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:55,814
A great favourite of mine, sir.
I assure you.

455
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:57,574
A dear little girl.

456
00:28:58,332 --> 00:28:59,838
Nellie.
- Nell?

457
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:06,814
Where are they? Where have they gone?

458
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:08,017
I don't know.

459
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:09,877
I wish I did.

460
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:11,415
You don't know?

461
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,031
The fact is they have given me the slip.

462
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:17,767
Vanished this very morning.
- Then they must be found.

463
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,307
It's for their own advantage.
- Is it indeed?

464
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:21,910
If you can help me find them ..

465
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,137
You can't be more anxious
to find them than me, sir.

466
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,890
I have been a good friend to them.

467
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,662
If you get news of them perhaps
you'll let me know at once?

468
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:29,742
Certainly.

469
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:32,354
What address shall I ..?
- I've no settled address. As yet.

470
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:33,159
Oh?

471
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,122
If you're looking for
lodgings in London, sir.

472
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:38,468
I do recommend very
good ones in Bevis Marks.

473
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,178
A lawyer. Name of Brass.

474
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,966
Brass, eh? Thank you.

475
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:43,892
I'll write that down.

476
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:50,922
If you can find them for me I
will make it worth your while.

477
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:52,899
I'll make it worth my while.
- Thank you.

478
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:54,321
Thank you, sir.

479
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:56,268
I'll do everything I assure you.

480
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,616
Everything in my power.

481
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:02,226
To help you to find them.

482
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:04,959
That is very alike.

483
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:08,564
I have got to help myself
to find them first.

484
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,784
Don't stare at me.

485
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,068
Get my breakfast, dear Mrs Quilp.

486
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:17,021
My breakfast.

487
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:24,012
So my master's a thief, is he?
- Yes, you know he is.

488
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:27,264
Let me tell you Quilp is the ugliest
dwarf I've seen anywhere for a penny.

489
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,309
Ha. Ugly?

490
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:30,680
Well, what about Nell?
She is ugly if you like.

491
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:32,392
Oh, she is, is she?

492
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:33,598
Right.

493
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:53,072
You dogs.

494
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,930
Fight, you dogs! Fight.

495
00:30:56,435 --> 00:30:57,891
I will beat you to a pulp.

496
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,969
He said you're the ugliest dwarf
that can be seen for a penny.

497
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:04,307
Do you mean to say I am not?
- No.

498
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,796
Then what do you want to fight in
front of my shop for, you dogs?

499
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:09,239
Because he said you were.

500
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:10,635
Not because you ain't.

501
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,574
And why did he say my master is a thief?

502
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:13,821
He said that?

503
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:17,748
He said what he did because he's a fool.

504
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:19,713
You said what you did ..

505
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,457
Because you are very wise.

506
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:22,757
Very clever.

507
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,004
Kit.

508
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:26,272
Always at all times.

509
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,594
Speak the truth.

510
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:28,890
Yes, of course.

511
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:29,971
Then tell me.

512
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,850
You have no idea where your
master and Miss Nell have gone?

513
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:33,819
Gone?

514
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:36,801
You've not the smallest idea?

515
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:37,930
No.

516
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:39,430
Are you quite sure?

517
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,159
I wouldn't tell you if I did know.

518
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:42,921
What? You wouldn't?
- No I wouldn't.

519
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:46,080
Very well, Christopher.

520
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,826
Very well.

521
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:51,939
I hope your honesty will
meet with a suitable reward.

522
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:54,927
Oh, I do hope it will.

523
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:07,486
It's all wrong.

524
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,625
Broken here and ..

525
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:12,127
Broken.

526
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:18,356
Someone is coming.
- We don't want no crowd in here.

527
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,569
Two ain't a crowd.
- Oh, ain't it?

528
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:23,081
If you had to stand in front
of a curtain like I do ..

529
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:26,414
You would know that anything over
one is a crowd in our business.

530
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:35,158
Good day.
- Good day.

531
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:42,029
Is this the first time you've
seen a Punch off the stage?

532
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,009
Yes.

533
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:45,358
Why do you come here to do this?

534
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:49,033
Well, sir. It don't do for the public to
see the company undergoing repairs.

535
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:51,433
It would destroy all the delusions.

536
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,497
It is this Judy.
She's all falling to pieces.

537
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:57,357
You ain't got a needle and
thread on you I suppose?

538
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,008
I have, sir. Will you let me
try and mend it for you?

539
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,275
Why certainly.

540
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:04,927
Well now. That's really kind, that is.

541
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,226
Where might you be going, sir?

542
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:11,001
We haven't quite decided.

543
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:15,671
If you want somewhere to stay I'd advise
you to put up at the same place as us.

544
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,464
The Jolly Sandboys.
- Thank you.

545
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,098
We'll go with you.

546
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:21,606
Come on then.

547
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,409
Come on, Tommy. Come on.

548
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:55,668
Alright, Shorty. Alright.

549
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:04,118
They are strangers, Tommy.

550
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:07,550
Down for the races?
- Aye.

551
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,077
Doing a bit of practice?

552
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:11,745
Well, it's better than carrying
them about, isn't it.

553
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:17,378
Which road are you taking?
- We are taking the longest road.

554
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:20,271
You see, the more miles we do tonight.

555
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,104
The more we'll save tomorrow.

556
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:23,201
That's true.

557
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,372
I suppose they're on
the road to the races.

558
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:38,358
Yes. But that old man
and the little girl ..

559
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:40,860
Are a queer couple to be
travelling with the Punch.

560
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,035
Well, here's to the landlord.

561
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,388
To the landlord.

562
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:55,544
The landlord.

563
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:57,888
A drop of warm ale.

564
00:35:00,488 --> 00:35:01,832
Who are they?

565
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:06,078
Don't you know?
- No.

566
00:35:06,378 --> 00:35:08,406
They're no good.
- They're no harm.

567
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:09,931
Here.

568
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:11,464
I tell you what.

569
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,449
It's plain the old man
ain't in his right mind.

570
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:16,039
Have you just found that out?

571
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:18,559
That handsome child
ain't used to the road.

572
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:22,881
Have you seen how the old man
is always wanting to get ..

573
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:24,347
Further away?

574
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,037
And what then?
- This.

575
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:30,134
He has given his friends the slip.

576
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:33,044
And persuaded that delicate young
creature to come along with him.

577
00:35:33,284 --> 00:35:34,942
All because of her fondness for him.

578
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:37,795
Now, I ain't going to see
them come to no harm.

579
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:40,891
I'm going to restore them
to their sorrowing friends.

580
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:44,994
Shorty, there may be a lot of
good sense in what you say.

581
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,486
Ah, but we mustn't let
them give us the slip.

582
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:49,614
The more we must.

583
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:52,713
And remember if there
should be any reward.

584
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:55,885
We are partners in everything.

585
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:00,054
You must have a long rest.
We'll go to bed directly after supper.

586
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:02,678
Do you think it's safe
for us to stay here?

587
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:05,837
Oughtn't we go on?
Just a little further?

588
00:36:07,097 --> 00:36:08,473
No-one can hurt us here.

589
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,801
Another pint of warm ale.

590
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:14,270
Oh, what a lovely smell.

591
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,391
What's this?

592
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,640
I'll tell you. It's a stew. Of tripe.

593
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:22,994
And cow-heel.

594
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:25,758
Yes. And new potatoes.

595
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:27,538
And sparrow-grass.

596
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:31,625
Good evening ladies and gents.
Here we are again.

597
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:35,015
Come on. You've been
lagging behind all day.

598
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:37,423
Don't keep nagging at me. Nag, nag, nag.

599
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,603
You're just in time for a
nice drop of hot stew.

600
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,573
Stew? Here, pass it over.

601
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:45,797
New potatoes and everything.

602
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,326
Another warm ale.

603
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,157
And one for my little boy.

604
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:52,139
Oh look. Them is Jerry's dogs.

605
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:53,489
He can't be far behind.

606
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,679
He'll have to be quick
if he wants any stew.

607
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:57,828
Good evening, all.
- Good evening, Jerry.

608
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:00,489
Your people don't usually
travel in costume, do they?

609
00:37:00,694 --> 00:37:03,184
No. But we've been playing on the
road to the race-going crowds.

610
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,553
Here. Look at them
there dogs over there.

611
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,834
No, no my dear. No.

612
00:37:10,256 --> 00:37:12,867
Not a morsel out of anyone's
hand but mine if you please.

613
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:15,020
That dog lost a halfpenny today.

614
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:16,854
He goes without his supper. Now.

615
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,774
The dogs whose name
is called, eats. Here.

616
00:37:21,754 --> 00:37:23,554
Come on. Towser. Towser.

617
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:25,524
Come on. Come on.

618
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,473
Good dogs. Good dogs.

619
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:43,180
Stand up. Stand up. Good. Good.

620
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:46,530
Good dogs. Again.

621
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:48,799
How much is it please?
- A florin.

622
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,409
And the lodgings?
- They're included.

623
00:37:55,324 --> 00:37:57,110
Are you ready now?
- Yes.

624
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:04,044
Towser.

625
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:06,811
Keep it up. Keep it up.
Stand up. Stand up.

626
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:08,419
Keep at it. Come on.

627
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,520
Tomorrow, I'm going to gather some
flowers and sell them at the races.

628
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:26,533
So we shall have to get up early.
- Yes, yes.

629
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:29,120
In the morning, we must go on further.

630
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:31,342
Further.

631
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:32,356
Goodnight.

632
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:34,759
Goodnight.

633
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,771
God bless you.

634
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:07,157
Shush.

635
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:08,321
Look.

636
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,350
What is it?

637
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,981
Listen, my dear.

638
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,244
I'm sure you may not know it.

639
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:19,534
But it's me that's your friend.

640
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:21,874
Not him.

641
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:24,146
Not who?
- 'Short', my dear.

642
00:39:24,644 --> 00:39:27,194
I am only an open-hearted man.

643
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:29,428
I may not look it.

644
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:31,320
But I am.

645
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:33,986
You stick close to me.

646
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:36,393
And always say it was me ..

647
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:37,955
That was your friend.

648
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:43,086
You can't think what
an interest I take in you.

649
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:47,197
Do you think I don't
know your little history?

650
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,550
What history?

651
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:51,876
About you and the poor old gentleman.

652
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,080
You know about my grandfather?
- Yes.

653
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,780
But you needn't tell Short we've
had this little talk together.

654
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,578
Recollect the friend.

655
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,603
It's Codlin who's the friend.

656
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:16,521
Not 'Short'.

657
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:26,525
Are these the only dogs you got, Jerry?

658
00:40:26,714 --> 00:40:28,464
No. I got about a dozen.

659
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:29,403
A dozen?

660
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:31,644
And I never lets anybody
feed them but me.

661
00:40:34,053 --> 00:40:35,680
Hey, Tommy.
- Hello.

662
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,445
Have you got the show ready?
- I'm just going to put it up.

663
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:40,164
Well, we ain't got much time.

664
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:43,629
As I was saying, I never lets
anybody feed them but me.

665
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:05,938
Grandfather.

666
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:08,966
I'm frightened.

667
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:11,340
Those men. They know about
us and want to send us back.

668
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:14,151
What? What's that?
- We must get away from here.

669
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:15,158
Yes.

670
00:41:16,738 --> 00:41:18,075
They say I am mad.

671
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,700
They will chain me up in a stone room.

672
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,891
I shall never see you again.
- They shan't do that. We'll go tonight.

673
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,490
I'll find a time when we can steal away.

674
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:32,613
Let me think now.
An old gentleman and a little girl?

675
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:34,666
Yes. I remember the
parties most particular.

676
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:36,815
They was travelling with
the Punch and Judy.

677
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:37,691
Oh.

678
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:40,355
If anybody else comes asking for them.

679
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,438
You haven't seen them.
- Ah, that's as may be.

680
00:41:43,638 --> 00:41:45,311
You don't remember anything about them.

681
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:48,728
That depends on if I see
the young Queen's picture.

682
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:50,082
Oh.

683
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,974
Thank you, sir.

684
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,486
Can't we rest here?
We've been walking all day.

685
00:42:07,696 --> 00:42:08,946
We must be safe now.

686
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:10,326
Are you sure?

687
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:28,541
Listen. What's that?

688
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:39,205
Look. There is Quilp.

689
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,463
How did you find the cold pie, George?

690
00:42:57,763 --> 00:42:59,018
It weren't a miss, ma'am.

691
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:01,252
And the beer, George? Was it passable?

692
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:05,023
It was flatter than it might have been
but it weren't so bad for all that.

693
00:43:05,647 --> 00:43:07,464
Have you heard who won
the Helter-Skelterman?

694
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:08,239
No.

695
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:11,973
Hey, you.

696
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:14,394
Who won the Helter-Skelter plate?

697
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:15,692
The what, ma'am?

698
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:18,827
The Helter-Skelter plate at the races.

699
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:20,696
Weren't you there?
- No, ma'am.

700
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:22,211
Come here.

701
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:27,669
But I saw you on the road in
company with a low, vulgar Punch.

702
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:31,322
I'm sorry I was.
A nice little girl like you.

703
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,112
Do you know those gentlemen, ma'am?

704
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:34,558
Know them?

705
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,707
Do I look as if I know them?

706
00:43:37,007 --> 00:43:38,745
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

707
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:42,157
Granted. Come closer, child.

708
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:47,656
Are you hungry?

709
00:43:48,447 --> 00:43:50,077
A little. But not very.

710
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:52,868
Then you had better have some tea.

711
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:55,482
I suppose you're agreeable
to that, old gentleman?

712
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:00,322
Take this away George and
bring some cups and saucers.

713
00:44:08,518 --> 00:44:10,047
Take this knuckle of ham.

714
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:14,009
Now hand me up the teapot for a little
more hot water and a pinch of fresh tea.

715
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:18,242
No, sir. I ain't seen no couple. Not I.

716
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,284
You're sure they came by on this road?

717
00:44:20,554 --> 00:44:22,055
I traced them on to Watling Street.

718
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:24,146
An old gentleman and a little girl?
I seen them.

719
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:25,375
You have? Where?

720
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:27,988
They was travelling with a Punch
and Judy. You recollect, Jack?

721
00:44:28,295 --> 00:44:30,445
Where did they go?
- To the races, I reckon.

722
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:32,849
To the races? I'm glad to know that.

723
00:44:35,374 --> 00:44:36,590
Thank you, sir.
- Right.

724
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,643
What did you want to say that for?

725
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:45,871
I promised the little man I wouldn't
tell anyone which way they'd gone.

726
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:47,303
How did I know?

727
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:51,077
Can you read, child?

728
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:52,226
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:54,523
Well, what a thing that is. I can't.

730
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:56,201
Read that.

731
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,060
Oh. 'Jarley's Was Work'.

732
00:44:58,335 --> 00:44:59,122
That's me.

733
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:00,680
I am Mrs Jarley.

734
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:01,760
Oh.

735
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:05,364
Never keep company with
a vulgar Punch after this.

736
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,951
I never saw a wax-work.

737
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:08,537
Is it funnier than Punch?

738
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,831
Funnier? It's not funny at all.

739
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,686
Oh.

740
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,554
It's calm and classical.

741
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:15,587
Is it here, ma'am?
- Is what here?

742
00:45:15,776 --> 00:45:16,716
The Wax-Work.

743
00:45:17,136 --> 00:45:18,682
Why bless me, no.

744
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,327
It's gone on in the van.

745
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:21,161
Oh.

746
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:25,424
Come inside for a minute.
I want to say something to you.

747
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:38,620
Sit down, my dear.

748
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:43,430
You have a way with you that most
people wouldn't find unpleasant.

749
00:45:43,814 --> 00:45:45,001
You could take my place.

750
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,546
And point out the wax
figures to the people.

751
00:45:47,936 --> 00:45:49,148
Do you want employment?

752
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:50,339
Oh, thank you.

753
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:53,498
But I couldn't leave my grandfather.

754
00:45:53,898 --> 00:45:55,010
Old gentleman.

755
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,711
Do you want a good situation
for your granddaughter?

756
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:00,970
What would become of me without her?

757
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:04,163
I'd have thought you were old enough to
look after yourself if you ever will be.

758
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:05,824
Don't be unkind to him please.

759
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,560
Well, well.

760
00:46:07,836 --> 00:46:09,841
I might find a little job for him too.

761
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:11,978
It isn't a common offer.

762
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:14,401
Remember it's Jarley's Wax-Work.

763
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:17,837
The duties are very light and genteel
and the company particularly select.

764
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,851
There's nothing of your open-air
vagrancy about Jarley's.

765
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:24,926
My exhibition takes place in the
assembly rooms or the town hall.

766
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:28,581
Walk up. Walk up ladies and gents.

767
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:31,613
And see Jarley's collection
of stupendous waxworks.

768
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:36,549
Upwards of one hundred figures as shown
before all the crowned heads of Europe.

769
00:46:37,353 --> 00:46:38,225
Don't be shy.

770
00:46:38,414 --> 00:46:42,000
Walk up and see this unique
collection of famous personages.

771
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:46,527
And finally, he was sent to the
gallows for poisoning 24 families ..

772
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:47,958
With pickled walnuts.

773
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:57,012
This, ladies and gentlemen
is Jasper Packlemerton.

774
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,815
A most atrocious memory.

775
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:01,040
Who courted and married fourteen wives.

776
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:05,010
And then destroyed them all by tickling
the soles of their feet as they slept.

777
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:09,750
On being brought to the scaffold he was
asked if he was sorry for what he did.

778
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:11,865
And he replied: 'Yes, he was sorry'.

779
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,746
'For having let 'em off so easily'.

780
00:47:14,195 --> 00:47:17,459
And he hoped all Christian husbands
would pardon him the offence.

781
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,126
Let this be a warning
to all young ladies ..

782
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:23,008
To be particular in the character
of the gentleman of their choice.

783
00:47:24,379 --> 00:47:25,108
Observe.

784
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:27,703
His fingers are curved as
if in the act of tickling.

785
00:47:28,308 --> 00:47:30,123
And his face is represented with a wink.

786
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:32,620
As he appeared when committing
his barbarous crimes.

787
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,214
Very nice, my dear.

788
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:43,412
She has such a genteel way with her.

789
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:06,826
Well, dogs. Here we are back in London.

790
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,133
Yes. Thank goodness.

791
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:37,440
Luggage, sir?
- Yes.

792
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:38,916
Take that to a cab.

793
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:50,226
Where to, sir?

794
00:48:50,415 --> 00:48:52,066
Bevis Marks. Mr Brass's house.

795
00:48:52,452 --> 00:48:53,222
Right.

796
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:23,870
Who made the fair copy of
this ejectment, Sammy?

797
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:25,259
Let me see.

798
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,077
Who do you think?

799
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:31,988
He did.

800
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:33,481
Did I?

801
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:34,816
It's disgraceful.

802
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,469
Have it your own way, ma'am.

803
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:39,494
Why should we keep a clerk
like that just to please Quilp?

804
00:49:39,872 --> 00:49:41,400
Have we another client like Quilp?

805
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:45,630
I would do anything to oblige him.

806
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:47,584
Confound Quilp.

807
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,537
There's my Sally.

808
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:52,335
The virgin of Venice.

809
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:54,138
The woman I ought to have married.

810
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,588
Very good. Very good indeed.

811
00:49:56,854 --> 00:49:58,138
Really quite eccentric.

812
00:49:58,507 --> 00:49:59,640
There she is.

813
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:02,391
Hard-hearted as the metal from
from which she takes her name.

814
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:04,447
I wonder you are not
ashamed of yourself.

815
00:50:04,726 --> 00:50:06,088
Oh, why don't you change it?

816
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,316
Melt down the brass and
take another name.

817
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:10,203
Hold your nonsense, do.

818
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:17,282
And how is my pet clerk getting on?

819
00:50:17,677 --> 00:50:18,832
No earthly use to us.

820
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,400
Ah, but he's useful to me.

821
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:23,293
Because he has got expectations.
So keep an eye on him.

822
00:50:23,763 --> 00:50:25,193
Yes, Mr Swiveller.

823
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,066
You should be proud to have
the friendship of Mr Quilp.

824
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:32,128
Will you and Sally come across to the
Red Lion with me to talk some business?

825
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:34,122
If you can spare the time.

826
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,222
Spare the time? You're joking, sir.

827
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:39,738
It is not everyone who has
the chance of your company.

828
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,034
Young man.

829
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:42,746
You will mind the office.

830
00:50:45,038 --> 00:50:46,171
If anyone calls.

831
00:50:46,703 --> 00:50:47,633
Take a message.

832
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,235
I shan't be long.

833
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:52,034
I'll be back in a few minutes.

834
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:55,951
I am very sorry to hear it.

835
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:58,498
And if you could manage to be
run over so much the better.

836
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:03,844
That female dragon.

837
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,017
Just because my aunt stops my
allowance I have to be clerk to you.

838
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:08,568
Well, what will I be next?

839
00:51:08,757 --> 00:51:10,858
A convict? Or is that
too genteel for me?

840
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:12,604
Come in.

841
00:51:15,497 --> 00:51:16,636
Please, sir.

842
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,711
Will you come and show the lodgings?

843
00:51:19,224 --> 00:51:20,613
It is 18 shillings a week.

844
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:22,115
Boots and fires lit.

845
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:24,469
Why don't you show them yourself?

846
00:51:24,856 --> 00:51:26,475
Miss Sally said I wasn't to.

847
00:51:26,699 --> 00:51:30,527
Because they'd think the attendance was
poor if they saw how small I was first.

848
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:32,898
They'll see how small you
are afterwards, won't they?

849
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,353
Ah, but then they'd have took the rooms.

850
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:36,892
Paid in advance.

851
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:39,374
Do you do all the work of the house?

852
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,255
Do you get plenty to eat?

853
00:51:41,738 --> 00:51:42,353
Yes.

854
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:43,274
Yes.

855
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:44,590
Is anybody there?

856
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,247
I can't wait any longer.

857
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:59,339
I understand sir, you desire
to look at these apartments.

858
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:01,307
Very charming apartment, sir.

859
00:52:01,502 --> 00:52:03,708
Commanding an uninterrupted
view of over the way.

860
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:06,905
And now within one minute's
walk of the corner of the street.

861
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,148
What's the rent?

862
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,995
18 shillings. One pound per week.

863
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:11,584
Boots and fires is extra.

864
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:12,822
I'll take them.

865
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:15,023
There you are.

866
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:17,175
Thank you kindly, sir.

867
00:52:22,536 --> 00:52:24,876
Here is ten pounds on account.
- Ten pounds?

868
00:52:25,566 --> 00:52:27,895
My name isn't Brass.
- I didn't say it was.

869
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:30,830
The master of the house is Brass.
- A good name for a lawyer.

870
00:52:31,629 --> 00:52:33,605
And the woman of the house. What is she?

871
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:34,845
A dragon.
- Huh?

872
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:36,913
Wife?
- Sister.

873
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:40,043
Well, tell them I don't want to be
troubled or asked any questions.

874
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:42,781
I beg your pardon. Your name?
In case of letters.

875
00:52:43,014 --> 00:52:44,745
I never have any.
- Well, if anyone calls.

876
00:52:44,968 --> 00:52:47,430
Nobody will call.
- Don't blame me if mistakes occur.

877
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:49,307
Blame not the bard.
- I blame nobody.

878
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:51,566
When he who adores thee
has left but a name ..

879
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,104
Go farther away from the leg of mutton.

880
00:53:20,293 --> 00:53:21,921
Or you will be picking at it I know.

881
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:27,417
Do you see this?

882
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:28,675
Yes.

883
00:53:28,925 --> 00:53:31,596
Then don't you ever go and
say you haven't had meat here.

884
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:33,847
Now, go on. Eat it up.

885
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,328
Do you want any more?

886
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:39,822
No.

887
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:41,349
You were helped once to meat.

888
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:43,554
You were asked if you want
more and you answered no.

889
00:53:44,008 --> 00:53:45,481
You've had as much as you can eat.

890
00:54:16,475 --> 00:54:17,833
My eyes are upon you, madam.

891
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:21,269
Oh. Please don't tell on me, sir.

892
00:54:21,704 --> 00:54:22,948
She will beat me to death.

893
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:25,386
I wouldn't take much, sir.

894
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:28,323
Only enough to squench my hunger.

895
00:54:28,812 --> 00:54:30,046
I understand.

896
00:54:30,362 --> 00:54:31,378
What is your name?

897
00:54:32,316 --> 00:54:33,646
Well, what does she call you?

898
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:35,426
Little devil.

899
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,191
How old are you?

900
00:54:38,754 --> 00:54:40,406
I don't know, Mr Swiveller.

901
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:42,890
Well, shut your eyes tight.

902
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:45,543
And don't open them until I tell you.

903
00:54:50,878 --> 00:54:51,955
Now open them.

904
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:03,078
Beer.

905
00:55:04,017 --> 00:55:04,853
Beer.

906
00:55:05,548 --> 00:55:06,792
Have you ever tasted beer?

907
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,521
I had a sip of it once.

908
00:55:09,693 --> 00:55:10,953
Here's a state of things.

909
00:55:11,205 --> 00:55:12,534
It can't be tasted in a sip.

910
00:55:13,055 --> 00:55:15,135
You tuck into that and
wait until I come back.

911
00:55:22,438 --> 00:55:24,104
Hey, boy. Where's my beer?

912
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:26,648
The governor said I was
to leave you none.

913
00:55:26,837 --> 00:55:28,195
He will have his little jokes.

914
00:55:29,053 --> 00:55:30,088
That's alright.

915
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,309
Tell him I'll call round
and settle tomorrow.

916
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,604
I have heard that tale before.
- Yes.

917
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:40,691
Here.

918
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:45,827
Take a pull of this.
But moderate your transports.

919
00:55:50,953 --> 00:55:51,841
Is it good?

920
00:55:52,317 --> 00:55:53,189
Oh, ain't it.

921
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,146
Remember the once popular melody ..

922
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:56,780
'Begone dull care'.

923
00:55:57,215 --> 00:56:00,151
'Fan the sinking flame of hilarity
with the wing of friendship'.

924
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,029
'And pass the rosy wine'.

925
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,019
Lord.

926
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:12,341
What's this?

927
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,679
Do you play cribbage?

928
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:15,183
No, Mr Swiveller.

929
00:56:15,423 --> 00:56:16,798
Then I'll teach you.

930
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,672
And to make it all seem
more real and pleasant ..

931
00:56:21,217 --> 00:56:22,204
I shall call you:

932
00:56:22,486 --> 00:56:23,707
'The Marchioness'.

933
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,451
Now then, Marchioness.

934
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:34,432
Fire away.

935
00:56:45,337 --> 00:56:46,822
Hey! You men.

936
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:49,297
I want to talk to you. Come in here.

937
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,436
Do you hear what the
gentleman says, Tommy?

938
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:52,988
I ain't no talker.

939
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,566
Come on Shorty.
What are you waiting for?

940
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:04,416
Ain't you got any manners?

941
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:13,225
Now then, you boys and girls run away.

942
00:57:13,423 --> 00:57:16,024
The performance will positively
commence a little later on.

943
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:17,390
Go off now. All of you.

944
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:18,973
Run away.

945
00:57:19,162 --> 00:57:19,891
Come in.

946
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:29,451
Tommy.

947
00:57:29,764 --> 00:57:33,648
Didn't I tell you there was sure to be
an enquiry after them two travellers?

948
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:35,942
Didn't I tell you that I
loved that blessed child?

949
00:57:36,131 --> 00:57:38,153
Here, let me speak.
- The pretty creature.

950
00:57:38,464 --> 00:57:40,099
'Codlin is my friend' she said.

951
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:43,386
With a tear of gratitude
trickling down her little eye.

952
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,392
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

953
00:57:45,722 --> 00:57:47,448
'Codlin' to my friends. Not 'Short'.

954
00:57:47,706 --> 00:57:49,174
Will you leave off aggravating.

955
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:52,562
'Short is all very well' she said.
'But Codlin is not after my money'.

956
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:54,092
But he mightn't look it.

957
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,327
So you can give me no information
that would help me?

958
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,255
Here. Wait a minute.

959
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,755
There's a man of the name of Jerry, sir.
Who keeps a company of dancing dogs.

960
00:58:02,952 --> 00:58:04,414
Shut up about Jerry.

961
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:06,666
When I think of that
there darling child.

962
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:08,154
Will you never leave off?

963
00:58:08,623 --> 00:58:09,375
Shut up.

964
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:12,439
Jerry told me he had seen them
with a travelling waxworker.

965
00:58:12,785 --> 00:58:14,029
Somewhere in the Midlands.

966
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:16,569
Is this man in London?
- He will be tomorrow.

967
00:58:16,878 --> 00:58:19,047
And he lodges at our house.
- Send him here.

968
00:58:19,855 --> 00:58:21,825
Here is a sovereign each.
- Thanks very much.

969
00:58:22,086 --> 00:58:24,570
And if I find them by your help
there will be twenty more.

970
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:26,826
'Dear good Codlin', she said.

971
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:29,792
'He's always devising pleasures for me'.

972
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:32,808
Once, she called me Father Codlin.

973
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:35,588
I thought I should have bust.

974
00:58:41,335 --> 00:58:44,322
Queer company for our lodger to keep.
Yesterday it was a Punch and Judy.

975
00:58:44,556 --> 00:58:46,782
Yes. And this morning it
was a man called Jerry.

976
00:58:46,971 --> 00:58:48,877
Now it's the boy who
worked at old Trent's shop.

977
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:51,225
What does it all mean?
- Something shady.

978
00:58:51,414 --> 00:58:52,845
Can't we find out what it is?

979
00:58:53,165 --> 00:58:54,460
Quilp will want to know.

980
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:56,525
Shush. Don't make a noise.

981
00:58:59,527 --> 00:59:01,829
I heard you've worked for
Mr Trent, dealer in curiosities.

982
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:02,890
Yes, sir.

983
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,267
So I sent for you to tell you
I've traced your old master.

984
00:59:05,535 --> 00:59:07,208
And Miss Nell? Where are they, sir?

985
00:59:07,397 --> 00:59:11,291
A man called Jerry tells me they're
somewhere 30 miles north of Coventry.

986
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,734
So I shall go there and make enquiries.

987
00:59:14,196 --> 00:59:16,626
If I take a post-chaise, I shall
reach there tomorrow morning.

988
00:59:27,911 --> 00:59:28,526
Hmm.

989
00:59:30,273 --> 00:59:33,365
Well, you save me the trouble of telling
you I travel to Coventry tonight.

990
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:36,149
I shall want my bag got
ready for the journey.

991
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:42,007
Coventry, did he say?
- Yes.

992
00:59:42,316 --> 00:59:43,904
I will go round and tell Quilp myself.

993
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:47,350
Now listen, Kit.

994
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:49,479
I want you to come with me.
- Me, sir?

995
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,393
They know you. They don't know me.

996
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:54,996
You can convince them
I am friendly to them.

997
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:57,138
I'm afraid that I might do
more harm than good.

998
00:59:57,608 --> 00:59:59,622
The master has been against
me since his illness.

999
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:02,619
Is there no-one else they will trust?

1000
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,778
Well, sir. There's mother.
- Do they know her?

1001
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,997
Yes. They were as kind to
her as they were to me.

1002
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:08,361
Then ask her to come.

1003
01:00:09,546 --> 01:00:10,762
Bring her to me at the ..

1004
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:13,008
At The Peacock in two hours' time.

1005
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:15,415
I will see that it's worth her while.

1006
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,764
Here is mother, sir.

1007
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:37,615
You're just in time, ma'am.
- Oh, I'm all of a flutter.

1008
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:39,263
You will be taken great care of.

1009
01:00:39,452 --> 01:00:40,408
But where is ..

1010
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:42,271
Where's my Sunday bonnet?
- Here it is.

1011
01:00:45,857 --> 01:00:47,122
Now mind the step, ma'am.

1012
01:00:47,347 --> 01:00:49,373
Mind how you go. Be careful Don't slip.

1013
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:50,798
There you are.

1014
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:00,058
Goodbye, Kit.

1015
01:01:00,463 --> 01:01:02,545
Be a good boy and look after the baby.

1016
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:21,734
Cheer up, young shaver.

1017
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:24,236
Come and be wafted with me
upon the pinions of concord.

1018
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,856
In other words, come and drink.

1019
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:28,291
And may you never want for a
friend or a bottle to give him.

1020
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,544
Nell.

1021
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,405
We must be moving on, my dear.

1022
01:01:47,657 --> 01:01:50,812
Don't forget we open at the
assembly rooms at five.

1023
01:01:51,629 --> 01:01:52,948
I'll tell grandfather.

1024
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,164
Who is that?

1025
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:12,634
Oh, it's you.

1026
01:02:13,113 --> 01:02:13,757
Nell.

1027
01:02:14,372 --> 01:02:17,057
If only I had money.
You're sure you have none?

1028
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:18,926
I gave you all I could spare.

1029
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:20,588
I could make your fortune quickly.

1030
01:02:21,256 --> 01:02:22,538
I must have money.

1031
01:02:23,467 --> 01:02:24,827
I must have money.

1032
01:02:26,507 --> 01:02:28,127
The takings are up tonight, George.

1033
01:02:28,409 --> 01:02:29,554
Looks like it alright.

1034
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:38,156
I'm going to my room now.

1035
01:03:03,129 --> 01:03:04,795
Goodnight my dear and bless you.

1036
01:03:05,097 --> 01:03:06,447
Goodnight, Mrs Jarley.

1037
01:03:06,718 --> 01:03:07,640
Goodnight.

1038
01:03:09,979 --> 01:03:11,142
Goodnight, darling.

1039
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,910
Grandfather, where are you going?

1040
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:10,620
What is it?

1041
01:04:10,998 --> 01:04:12,480
I have had a dreadful dream.

1042
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:15,780
It was about an old man
in a darkened room.

1043
01:04:16,009 --> 01:04:17,401
Who robbed while people slept.

1044
01:04:18,345 --> 01:04:19,495
We can't stay here.

1045
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:21,504
This dream is too real.

1046
01:04:21,818 --> 01:04:22,838
We must go away.

1047
01:04:23,618 --> 01:04:24,607
Tonight?
- Yes.

1048
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:26,303
Tomorrow will be too late.

1049
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,532
I know this dream will come true.

1050
01:04:28,837 --> 01:04:30,110
And you will be taken away.

1051
01:04:31,843 --> 01:04:34,647
If you don't want them to take you,
you must come with me now.

1052
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:41,034
Yes. I will go with you.

1053
01:04:43,191 --> 01:04:44,988
You shall never have that dream again.

1054
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:48,478
Nell.

1055
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:49,896
Nell!

1056
01:04:53,294 --> 01:04:54,788
Where is that child?

1057
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:57,263
George, have you seen Nell this morning?
- No, ma'am.

1058
01:04:57,472 --> 01:04:59,060
Come to that, nor the old man neither.

1059
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:02,359
Whatever is this?

1060
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,065
Now, fancy writing me a letter
when she knows I can't read.

1061
01:05:08,356 --> 01:05:10,201
Here, George.
You will have to read it for me.

1062
01:05:10,464 --> 01:05:11,279
Yes, ma'am.

1063
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,440
'Dear Mrs Jarley'.
- Yes, yes.

1064
01:05:15,088 --> 01:05:16,337
'Forgive us'.

1065
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,044
'For L-e-a-v .. leaving ..'.

1066
01:05:19,394 --> 01:05:20,123
Leaving?

1067
01:05:20,328 --> 01:05:21,839
'You like this'.

1068
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,717
Good gracious.

1069
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:26,921
'Thank you for all your ..'.

1070
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,138
'Kind-y-ness. Kindness'.

1071
01:05:31,463 --> 01:05:32,164
'Nell'.

1072
01:05:32,908 --> 01:05:35,105
Well, I never did.

1073
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:49,931
Good morning.

1074
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,564
Mrs Jarley I presume?
- That's me.

1075
01:05:53,252 --> 01:05:55,630
You have a gentleman and his
granddaughter with you I believe.

1076
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:57,085
I had.

1077
01:05:57,548 --> 01:05:58,259
Had?

1078
01:05:58,712 --> 01:06:00,193
They're not dead, are they?

1079
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:02,494
Not as bad as that. But they have gone.

1080
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:04,288
Gone?

1081
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:08,404
Where?
- That's the mystery.

1082
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,121
Come inside a moment.

1083
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:11,657
Excuse me, ma'am.

1084
01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:29,959
Why, it's Christopher's mother.

1085
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:31,165
Oh look.

1086
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,518
Such a dear, worthy woman.

1087
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:36,227
And you wouldn't believe how
fond I am of your honest son.

1088
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,291
Let me pass.

1089
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:39,438
I am going to do a lot for him one day.

1090
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:41,649
Will you let me pass?
- In good time.

1091
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,395
I can afford to wait.

1092
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:46,136
Oh, sir. It's Mr Quilp.

1093
01:06:46,653 --> 01:06:48,683
Only yesterday he was in London.

1094
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:50,325
Are you following us?

1095
01:06:50,779 --> 01:06:51,337
I?

1096
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:54,248
You were in London yesterday.
- So were you.

1097
01:06:54,566 --> 01:06:56,723
I might say that <i>you</i> were following <i>me</i>.

1098
01:06:57,256 --> 01:06:59,586
Why have you come here?
- And why have you come here?

1099
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,739
I won't ask why you are going back.

1100
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:03,881
But I wish you a pleasant journey.

1101
01:07:05,161 --> 01:07:05,996
Sure.

1102
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:18,507
One minute we are here.

1103
01:07:18,941 --> 01:07:21,643
The next we're there in the silent tomb.

1104
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,313
Are you sure my husband has drowned?

1105
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,651
There seems to be no doubt of it, ma'am.

1106
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,830
He was last seen on
the edge of the wharf.

1107
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:31,394
He must have slipped and tumbled in.

1108
01:07:32,857 --> 01:07:34,129
I can't believe it.

1109
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:37,067
Ah, what a vale of tears we live in.

1110
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,923
To think that I should
be drinking his rum.

1111
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:41,681
It seems like a dream.

1112
01:07:42,171 --> 01:07:43,757
Have a drop more. Do.

1113
01:07:44,118 --> 01:07:45,894
Yes. It is comforting to a body.

1114
01:07:46,176 --> 01:07:48,792
Ah, but what a comfort it
would be to have his body.

1115
01:07:49,238 --> 01:07:50,470
A dreary comfort.

1116
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:51,922
Oh, it would.

1117
01:07:52,787 --> 01:07:54,676
Then we should be quite sure.

1118
01:07:55,092 --> 01:07:57,513
When shall we look upon his like again?

1119
01:07:58,402 --> 01:07:59,990
We must send out a description of him.

1120
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:02,539
Now, how would you describe his nose?

1121
01:08:03,573 --> 01:08:04,254
Flat.

1122
01:08:05,274 --> 01:08:06,221
Aquiline.

1123
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,897
Aquiline, you hag.

1124
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:13,965
Do you call this flat?

1125
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:16,559
Do you, eh?
- No, No. I didn't think.

1126
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:20,320
Oh capital. Such an amazing power
of taking people by surprise.

1127
01:08:21,907 --> 01:08:25,234
If I could poison that dear
old lady I would have.

1128
01:08:27,345 --> 01:08:29,443
Have you been dragging
the river for me all day?

1129
01:08:29,669 --> 01:08:31,196
And yesterday too.
- Dear me.

1130
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:32,886
What a deal of trouble.

1131
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:42,708
Pray consider everything yours
that you find upon the body.

1132
01:08:43,178 --> 01:08:43,976
Hee-hee.

1133
01:08:44,183 --> 01:08:45,917
Such a flow of good humour.

1134
01:08:46,643 --> 01:08:48,118
How very whimsical.

1135
01:08:53,777 --> 01:08:56,714
So you thought I was drowned, did you?

1136
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,511
You thought you were a widow.

1137
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,931
I'm very sorry, Quilp.

1138
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:03,415
Oh, I'm sure you're very sorry.

1139
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,985
How could you be so cruel?
Disappearing like that without a word.

1140
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:09,863
I like disappearing.

1141
01:09:11,685 --> 01:09:12,615
I'm off again.

1142
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:13,994
Now.

1143
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:16,109
I'll be a bachelor.

1144
01:09:16,512 --> 01:09:18,305
You can go on thinking you are a widow.

1145
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:21,922
But I'll punch in here occasionally
when you don't expect me.

1146
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:25,156
To see if my dear widow
is behaving herself.

1147
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,031
Quilp, you don't mean it?

1148
01:09:27,546 --> 01:09:28,429
I do.

1149
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:32,291
I'll be a jolly bachelor.

1150
01:09:32,658 --> 01:09:34,044
And live in my counting house.

1151
01:09:46,768 --> 01:09:48,096
Ah, it is Kit.

1152
01:09:48,407 --> 01:09:49,496
Honest Kit.

1153
01:09:50,321 --> 01:09:51,305
How is mother?

1154
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:53,984
Why do you frighten my
mother, you little monster?

1155
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:57,399
Oh. So I am a monster now, eh?

1156
01:09:57,869 --> 01:10:01,335
A time ago, you said I was the ugliest
dwarf to be seen anywhere for a penny.

1157
01:10:01,584 --> 01:10:03,852
So you are. You are always
frightening people like mother.

1158
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:06,038
It was you that ruined my master.

1159
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:07,827
I, Kit?

1160
01:10:08,453 --> 01:10:09,211
Yes, you.

1161
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:10,165
How?

1162
01:10:13,938 --> 01:10:15,545
You're a clever boy, Kit.

1163
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:17,430
Too clever to live.

1164
01:10:17,953 --> 01:10:20,510
And I dare say you wish that I was dead?
- Yes, I do.

1165
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,370
You're not the only one.

1166
01:10:23,711 --> 01:10:26,625
But I am sorry.
I shan't oblige you just yet.

1167
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:52,673
Nell.

1168
01:10:53,477 --> 01:10:54,673
Speak to me.

1169
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,505
What is it?

1170
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,214
Nell.

1171
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:36,862
Sit down, boys.

1172
01:11:41,723 --> 01:11:43,780
Now we will resume our history lesson.

1173
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,615
Where we left off yesterday.

1174
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:48,072
I was telling about
the Kings of England.

1175
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:49,196
[ Door knocks ]

1176
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:51,242
See who that is.

1177
01:11:56,324 --> 01:11:58,283
Please, can you help me?

1178
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,566
It is my granddaughter.
- Certainly. Where is she?

1179
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:25,258
There she is, sir.

1180
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:31,594
She is exhausted.

1181
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:33,813
Has she walked far?
- Many miles.

1182
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:35,347
Poor child.

1183
01:12:35,948 --> 01:12:38,065
I never thought how
weak she was until now.

1184
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,118
What shall I do?

1185
01:12:40,535 --> 01:12:42,311
Can I take her into my house to rest?

1186
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:44,409
I should be grateful if you would, sir.

1187
01:13:20,802 --> 01:13:22,321
You may all go home now, boys.

1188
01:13:22,629 --> 01:13:23,871
But go quietly.

1189
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:39,369
In there, sir.

1190
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:57,599
Grandfather.

1191
01:13:58,088 --> 01:13:59,316
Here I am, darling.

1192
01:14:02,774 --> 01:14:03,905
I can't go on.

1193
01:14:04,252 --> 01:14:06,058
No. You mustn't think of it.

1194
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:09,164
Stay here awhile and get strong.

1195
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:11,644
If only we could.
- Why not?

1196
01:14:12,568 --> 01:14:15,082
We can talk about the
future when you are better.

1197
01:14:31,192 --> 01:14:31,778
Ah.

1198
01:14:32,126 --> 01:14:32,845
Listen.

1199
01:14:34,385 --> 01:14:36,643
This is business.
- Very good. Very good.

1200
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:38,323
Under what heading?

1201
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:39,577
No, no, no.

1202
01:14:39,926 --> 01:14:42,601
Put your book away.
We don't want any documents.

1203
01:14:43,406 --> 01:14:45,732
This is very private business.

1204
01:14:46,738 --> 01:14:48,245
There's a lad named Kit.

1205
01:14:48,938 --> 01:14:49,896
Do you know him?

1206
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:52,089
You mean the boy who
comes to see our lodger?

1207
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:53,359
That's him.

1208
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:55,018
I owe him a grudge.

1209
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,136
He is one of your honest people.

1210
01:14:57,624 --> 01:15:00,312
He is a prying hound. A sneaking spy.

1211
01:15:00,673 --> 01:15:02,095
A yelping young dog.

1212
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:03,648
In short, I hate him.

1213
01:15:03,905 --> 01:15:05,404
So do I.
- And so do I.

1214
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,839
Then half our work is done already.

1215
01:15:08,126 --> 01:15:10,013
Devise your own means, but ..

1216
01:15:10,371 --> 01:15:11,507
Put him out of my way.

1217
01:15:12,055 --> 01:15:13,771
Shall it be done?
- It shall, sir.

1218
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,570
Then give me your hand.

1219
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:17,665
Sally girl? Yours.

1220
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:38,587
This was the old counting house.

1221
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:40,529
It is very beautiful.

1222
01:15:40,924 --> 01:15:43,329
I am glad you think it is
beautiful, for it is yours.

1223
01:15:43,852 --> 01:15:44,973
Ours?
- Yes.

1224
01:15:47,023 --> 01:15:48,890
There's no verger here at present.

1225
01:15:49,523 --> 01:15:51,200
So I have spoken to the clergyman.

1226
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:53,688
And he agrees to take you to live here.

1227
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:56,791
And you will also be given a
small allowance of money.

1228
01:15:57,277 --> 01:16:00,177
For keeping the keys at the church.
And showing it to visitors.

1229
01:16:00,546 --> 01:16:01,991
How can I thank you, sir?

1230
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,093
You have made us so happy.
- The happiness is mine.

1231
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:09,131
I shall have you as close neighbours.

1232
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:10,625
Thank you, sir.

1233
01:16:11,933 --> 01:16:14,051
Why .. you are trembling.

1234
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,228
It's nothing.

1235
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:22,378
My dear child.

1236
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:48,669
Will you wait a moment
while I tell the gentleman?

1237

1408
01:27:38,748 --> 01:27:39,449
Mother?

1409
01:27:39,638 --> 01:27:41,312
Of course he can, sir.
- Very well, Kit.

1410
01:27:41,704 --> 01:27:42,491
You shall.

1411
01:28:07,249 --> 01:28:08,350
I'm glad you're here.

1412
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:10,484
I am rather late I am afraid.
- It's nearly two.

1413
01:28:10,721 --> 01:28:12,535
I had been hoping you
would arrive earlier.

1414
01:28:12,816 --> 01:28:14,232
It has been a difficult journey.

1415
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:15,598
Where do they live?

1416
01:28:15,787 --> 01:28:17,576
He lives over there
where you see the light.

1417
01:28:17,864 --> 01:28:18,450
He?

1418
01:28:19,398 --> 01:28:20,499
I will get a lantern.

1419
01:28:21,302 --> 01:28:22,931
While you're waiting sir, can I go on?

1420
01:28:41,673 --> 01:28:42,370
Hush.

1421
01:28:43,316 --> 01:28:44,293
Oh, master.

1422
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,870
My dear master.

1423
01:28:47,423 --> 01:28:48,155
Ghosts.

1424
01:28:49,543 --> 01:28:51,609
So many ghosts have been here tonight.

1425
01:28:52,088 --> 01:28:53,805
It's Kit. Your servant.

1426
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:55,585
You know me.

1427
01:28:56,346 --> 01:28:57,755
Sir, where is Nell?

1428
01:28:58,816 --> 01:28:59,995
They all ask that.

1429
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:02,652
They all ..

1430
01:29:03,358 --> 01:29:04,209
Ask that.

1431
01:29:04,604 --> 01:29:05,616
But where is she?

1432
01:29:05,859 --> 01:29:07,153
Tell me.
- Hush.

1433
01:29:09,513 --> 01:29:10,632
She's in there.

1434
01:29:11,837 --> 01:29:12,538
Asleep.

1435
01:29:14,545 --> 01:29:15,795
Thank God.

1436
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:18,050
I ..

1437
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:20,157
Thank God.

1438
01:29:22,019 --> 01:29:22,719
Hark.

1439
01:29:24,242 --> 01:29:25,304
Didn't she call?

1440
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:26,603
I heard no voice.

1441
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:28,991
Don't tell me you didn't hear that.

1442
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:31,165
Nor that.

1443
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:34,708
Can anyone know that voice ..

1444
01:29:35,226 --> 01:29:36,443
So well as I?

1445
01:30:17,065 --> 01:30:18,361
She didn't call.

1446
01:30:20,173 --> 01:30:21,528
She is still ..

1447
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,260
Asleep.

1448
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:30,321
I fear the light might dazzle
her eyes and wake her.

1449
01:30:31,257 --> 01:30:32,713
So I brought it here.

1450
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:35,672
She's sleeping soundly.

1451
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,447
Oh, master.

1452
01:30:39,974 --> 01:30:42,140
Why have they hidden
away her little dress?

1453
01:30:46,234 --> 01:30:47,996
She will miss it when she wakes.

1454
01:30:53,222 --> 01:30:54,078
I see.

1455
01:30:56,415 --> 01:30:57,569
These shoes.

1456
01:31:00,336 --> 01:31:01,521
How worn they are.

1457
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:06,069
She kept them to remind her.

1458
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:07,767
Of our journey here.

1459
01:31:10,307 --> 01:31:14,402
You can see where her little
feet went bare in the ground.

1460
01:31:16,369 --> 01:31:17,958
They told me afterwards.

1461
01:31:18,712 --> 01:31:20,565
The stones had cut them.

1462
01:31:22,345 --> 01:31:24,304
She never told me that.

1463
01:31:27,329 --> 01:31:29,382
But I have remembered since.

1464
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,516
She walked behind me.

1465
01:31:33,515 --> 01:31:35,227
So that I might not know.

1466
01:31:37,645 --> 01:31:38,492
Yes.

1467
01:31:39,611 --> 01:31:41,815
She had my hand in hers.

1468
01:31:42,946 --> 01:31:44,994
And seems to lead me ..

1469
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,109
Still.

1470
01:32:01,026 --> 01:32:02,109
Who is that?

1471
01:32:02,716 --> 01:32:04,075
Shut the door.

1472
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:08,678
Haven't we enough to do to
drive away that marble cold ..

1473
01:32:09,603 --> 01:32:11,647
And keep her warm.

1474
01:32:17,636 --> 01:32:18,559
Not in bed?

1475
01:32:19,443 --> 01:32:21,251
Won't you try and take some rest?

1476
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:23,570
Sleep has left me.

1477
01:32:25,372 --> 01:32:26,883
It is all with her.

1478
01:32:28,737 --> 01:32:31,149
And it is a good and happy sleep.

1479
01:32:36,036 --> 01:32:37,302
He doesn't know me.

1480
01:32:37,637 --> 01:32:38,841
And for days ..

1481
01:32:39,362 --> 01:32:41,980
He has hardly recognised me or anyone.

1482
01:32:42,889 --> 01:32:45,702
His thoughts are entirely with her.

1483
01:32:47,739 --> 01:32:49,336
We must have patience.

1484
01:33:10,972 --> 01:33:13,663
Why do you lie so idle there, dear Nell?

1485
01:33:14,457 --> 01:33:17,164
When your little friends
come creeping to the door.

1486
01:33:17,586 --> 01:33:18,466
Crying:

1487
01:33:18,951 --> 01:33:20,030
'Where is Nell'?

1488
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,002
'Sweet Nell'.

1489
01:33:23,269 --> 01:33:25,378
And weep because they do not see you.

1490
01:33:27,772 --> 01:33:30,548
She was always so gentle with children.

1491
01:33:31,817 --> 01:33:34,337
What is the earth compared
with that world ..

1492
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,526
To which her young spirit
has winged its early flight.

1493
01:33:39,737 --> 01:33:42,438
It's not on earth that
Heaven's justice ends.

1494
01:33:43,448 --> 01:33:46,043
If one wish could call her back.

1495
01:33:46,834 --> 01:33:48,662
Which of us would utter it?

1496
01:34:24,189 --> 01:34:24,927
Come.

1497
01:34:25,522 --> 01:34:26,639
Come away.

1498
01:34:27,793 --> 01:34:29,472
We are not apart.

1499
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:33,266
That will be our comfort
in our great affliction.

1500
01:34:34,771 --> 01:34:37,522
You plot among you to
wean my heart from her.

1501
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:39,150
You can never do that.

1502
01:34:39,445 --> 01:34:40,947
Never, while I have life.

1503
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:45,096
It is too late to part us now.

1504
01:34:45,408 --> 01:34:47,478
In Heaven's good time.

1505
01:35:00,473 --> 01:35:02,370
She will wake tomorrow.

1506
01:35:03,723 --> 01:35:04,449
Yes.

1507
01:35:04,976 --> 01:35:05,659
Her.

1508
01:35:06,205 --> 01:35:07,086
Her.

1509
01:35:08,426 --> 01:35:09,518
Her.

1510
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,538
She will wake tomorrow.

1511
01:35:40,316 --> 01:35:41,272
..r-s..
