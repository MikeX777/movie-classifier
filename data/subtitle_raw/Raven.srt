2
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't miss those condoms.

3
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:41,734
I'm sure.

4
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,213
You weren't lying
to me when you said

5
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:57,516
you got that
vasectomy, were you?

6
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:01,154
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

7
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,656
After six months, you feel
the need to ask me that?

8
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,593
It's not the only
thing I wanna ask.

9
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,363
'Kay.

10
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,205
Okay.

11
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:32,484
What is this?

12
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:38,557
It's more than just sex.

13
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:42,461
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

14
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:57,076
Sure you're okay?

15
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,243
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,114
If you want, I can
just leave some money

17
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:04,583
on the dresser and just leave.

18
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:08,054
Well, I mean,
considering this is your house,

19
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,521
shouldn't I be the one leaving?

20
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,525
Not if your face
is the first thing

21
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:15,260
I wanna see when I get back.

22
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:47,927
Hello?

23
00:02:50,362 --> 00:02:52,665
Yes, it is, who is this?

24
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:57,569
Yes, I am.

25
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,742
Did something
happen, is he okay?

26
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:08,480
What do you mean, accident?

27
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,549
Is he okay?

28
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:18,024
Okay, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

29
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:20,927
What's wrong?

30
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:24,697
My husband was in an accident.

31
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:02,148
Raven.

32
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:06,352
I'm not giving
you another opportunity

33
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,687
to put your hands
on me again, Ephrem.

34
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,959
- I deserve better.
- Wait, wait, Raven, Raven.

35
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:21,200
Sit down, please, baby.

36
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,172
Talk to me, come on, sit down.

37
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,119
Don't do this, Raven.

38
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,889
I just, you know.

39
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,631
Is that
all you have to say?

40
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,868
No, just
give me a second.

41
00:07:55,901 --> 00:08:00,272
A second, is that all?

42
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,843
Okay.

43
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,047
It's the least I can
do is give you a second

44
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:10,950
to say whatever it is
that you need to say

45
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:16,122
to try to make up for nearly
two years of physical abuse.

46
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:22,695
I just
need some time.

47
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:24,196
I wanna make this right for you.

48
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:28,234
Listen, baby, I don't wanna
lose our family, okay?

49
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:33,305
I deserve that, but just let
me make this right, please?

50
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:40,880
Take all the time
you need to make things right.

51
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,716
Raven.

52
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:44,450
Just do it for
yourself, but not for us.

53
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,684
Kenya!

54
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:48,187
Let's talk about this
later, don't do this.

55
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,921
June Bug!

56
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,723
Hey, hey, what's up, baby girl?

57
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:52,958
How you doing, how you doing?

58
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,162
Listen, it's okay, all right?

59
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:57,963
I'm your father.

60
00:08:57,997 --> 00:09:00,566
Don't you forget
that, all right?

61
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:11,777
Raven, slow down,
just let me talk.

62
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,300
So, what's
been going on?

63
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:13,138
Well, my dad got
in a car accident last night.

64
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,040
Oh my
God, what happened?

65
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,244
He was drunk driving.

66
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:21,914
Please, tell me he's okay.

67
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:25,484
He's in a coma.

68
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,091
I didn't appreciate it before.

69
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:34,960
What do you mean?

70
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:40,065
Well, when Mom and
Dad were together,

71
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,967
I just wish I was little again.

72
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:45,404
So, what's up with Ephrem?

73
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,706
You guys still talking?

74
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,108
Oh my God, almost
forgot to tell you.

75
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:49,942
Tell me what?

76
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:51,176
He's in a coma.

77
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:54,880
He got into a really bad
car accident last night.

78
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:59,818
Apparently, he got drunk,
ran right into a pole.

79
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:03,055
Fortunately, no one
else was involved.

80
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:07,727
Sorry, God, oh my God.

81
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:09,194
I went to see him last night.

82
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,767
Figured it was the
right thing to do.

83
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,435
Yeah, I definitely
wish I was 13 again.

84
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,238
Why do you say that?

85
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:23,942
Well, you know, I'm grown,
I'm living on my own, you know,

86
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:28,047
and I have a full-time job,
which is great and all.

87
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,749
It's just now I have a
lot more responsibilities,

88
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:33,519
like a car note, student
loans, groceries, rent.

89
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,823
If I didn't have a roommate,
I don't know where I'd be.

90
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:39,858
All I'm saying is when I was 13,

91
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:42,796
I definitely didn't have
to worry about any of that.

92
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,864
How's Kenya's
counseling working out?

93
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:46,965
I love her.

94
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,935
She's closer to Kenya's age.

95
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:51,603
They have an amazing connection,

96
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,273
and they have
something in common.

97
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,576
Meaning her parents
were divorced?

98
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,878
Mm hmm.

99
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:01,748
All right, okay,
so how long's it been

100
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,849
since you left Ephrem again?

101
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,555
Oh, it's almost a year now.

102
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:14,393
How is the
placeholder working out?

103
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:16,862
Hmm, well, the
placeholder's trying

104
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,197
to make himself a
permanent fixture.

105
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,168
Things are really
heating up, huh?

106
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,136
Yeah.

107
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:26,905
What about him?

108
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,040
The feeling's mutual.

109
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,577
Look, it doesn't
matter what's going on

110
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,278
in your life, Kenya.

111
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:34,913
There's always a
different perspective

112
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:36,850
you could choose to see.

113
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:40,119
So, just pick the best one
for you, and hold onto it.

114
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:44,990
Well, what would you
say the best perspective

115
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:46,258
is in my case?

116
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:50,864
Well, not to diminish
anything you're going through,

117
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:54,166
but both of your
parents are still alive.

118
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,901
They may not be together,

119
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,805
but they're both very
involved in your life.

120
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,439
What, do you
think it's too soon?

121
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,009
Of course, I do, Rae.

122
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:06,545
It's my job to
think it's too soon.

123
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,080
You're not even divorced yet.

124
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:12,017
See, that's why
I keep you around.

125
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,019
You know how to
keep me in check.

126
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:17,289
I really like him!

127
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:20,025
That's cool.

128
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:25,998
Do you think my
dad's gonna die?

129
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,870
I don't have the
answers to that,

130
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:33,605
but you know what
I'd do if I were you?

131
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,573
What?

132
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,008
I'd go talk to him.

133
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,075
But he can't hear me.

134
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:41,013
Of course he can
hear you, Kenya.

135
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:41,947
Can we go now?

136
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,449
Yeah, absolutely.

137
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:47,687
No.

138
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,454
What?

139
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,425
Sometimes it's just
hard for me to wrap

140
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,961
my mind around how much
things changed for you.

141
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,198
You guys have been
such a great family.

142
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:02,267
Yeah, well, you and me both.

143
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,766
Hey, baby.

144
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,600
Hey, Mom.

145
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,035
How are you?

146
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,203
I'm good.

147
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,339
Mind if I sit down?

148
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:42,107
No.

149
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:49,749
So, how was your day?

150
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,219
It was pretty good.

151
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:55,320
Yeah?

152
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,623
How was your
session with Falani?

153
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:01,360
- It was fun.
- Really?

154
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:02,427
What'd you do?

155
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,031
She took me to visit Dad.

156
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:08,567
Really?

157
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,606
We talked.

158
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,944
You know, that's good.

159
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:20,212
I can tell that she
really cares about you.

160
00:15:21,915 --> 00:15:24,182
No, I mean me and Dad.

161
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:27,352
At least, I talked to him.

162
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,236
Do you still love Dad?

163
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,240
Of course I do.

164
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:51,711
That's not what I mean.

165
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:05,257
Baby, it's complicated.

166
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,227
It's very complicated.

167
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,299
I know about your boyfriend.

168
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:20,205
Kinda figured that.

169
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,079
Are you in love with him?

170
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:30,850
No, no, no, it's too early.

171
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,521
I know you still
love Dad, Mom.

172
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:39,058
Love just doesn't
leave like that.

173
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,392
It's just buried
under all that stuff,

174
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:43,096
and you gotta dig it out.

175
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,833
Whatever you do,
don't give up on Dad.

176
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:51,536
Please, don't give up on him.

177
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:00,305
I got you your favorite.

178
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:02,108
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

179
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:03,208
That's sweet.

180
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:09,481
So, how's your husband?

181
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:12,350
He's the same.

182
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,489
How's Kenya?

183
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:21,994
She loves her dad.

184
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,399
Right.

185
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,480
Look, Quinn, I know
this is not easy for you.

186
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:45,617
I'm not insensitive to the
way you must be feeling.

187
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:50,455
Hey, look, it's okay.

188
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:51,623
If the tables were turned,

189
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,525
I'd probably be
doing the same thing.

190
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:02,769
I just wanna make
sure you know that.

191
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,509
Look, I gotta go, okay?

192
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,813
I'll call you later, all right?

193
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:15,782
All right.

194
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,452
Is it okay for us to be here?

195
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:33,551
Here, baby, have a seat.

196
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:13,458
Hey, Mom,
you remember that time

197
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:16,494
Dad came out with no
clothes on?

198
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:17,797
What, you remember that?

199
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,666
Yeah,
remember, he thought

200
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,600
I thought I was in bed, sleep.

201
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:26,339
But I stayed up late
watching a movie.

202
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:27,605
I didn't do anything wrong.

203
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,508
I was just watching TV.

204
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:32,577
He was just embarrassed.

205
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,713
That was your dad.

206
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:37,515
I swear, he grew up
on a nudist beach

207
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:39,685
somewhere in another life.

208
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:43,923
Couldn't stand to
wear clothes.

209
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,592
Couldn't?

210
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:50,329
Couldn't?

211
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,645
You talk like he's dead.

212
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,047
He's still here, Mom.

213
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:10,483
He's right there.

214
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,218
I know, I'm sorry.

215
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,121
That's not what I meant.

216
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,155
It's just-

217
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,890
- Can you step out for
a moment, Mrs. Hall?

218
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:30,369
I'll be back.

219
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:41,213
So, how are you doing?

220
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:44,650
Good.

221
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,721
Look, Mrs. Hall, I
wish I had something

222
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:52,124
more concrete to tell
you, but, the truth is,

223
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:53,292
this could go either way.

224
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:57,630
He's holding on, to
what, I don't know.

225
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:03,769
But I presume it's
to his family.

226
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:08,240
Now, I have no hard
core facts for what

227
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:09,642
I'm about to say to you.

228
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:11,277
This is strictly my opinion,

229
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:14,380
but the more love and
compassion he receives

230
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,015
from those closest to him,

231
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:18,751
the better his chances
are to recover.

232
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,925
We're all flawed human beings.

233
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,661
Flawed, but human.

234
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:34,393
So, the plot thickens.

235
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:36,262
Really, do tell.

236
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,801
I had coffee with
Quinn yesterday.

237
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:45,271
And?

238
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,945
It was awkward, you know?

239
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:59,018
I wanted so bad to reassure
him that we'd be okay.

240
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:00,819
I just couldn't.

241
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:07,661
I had to feel his
emotions, his thoughts,

242
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,762
his fears, his anxiety.

243
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:15,901
It's like I knew what
he wanted me to say.

244
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:21,307
I just couldn't say it,
you know what I mean?

245
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,975
No, not exactly.

246
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,351
So, he just got up, kissed
me, and then walked away.

247
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:35,888
You didn't try to stop him?

248
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:40,025
No.

249
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:45,731
I wanted to.

250
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:50,369
I think.

251
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:57,910
You still love Ephrem.

252
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:11,090
Ariana, how can I love a man

253
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:13,325
that used to treat me
as his punching bag?

254
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:19,465
And all the bruises, black eyes.

255
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:28,374
And Kenya, Kenya, she
knew what was going on.

256
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:29,275
She could hear the arguments.

257
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:37,950
But I still lied
and made up a bunch

258
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,120
of stupid excuses
for every bruise.

259
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:50,496
Why'd you stay so long?

260
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:54,133
That wasn't the Ephrem
I fell in love with.

261
00:27:57,737 --> 00:27:59,104
He changed.

262
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:05,712
I was hoping and praying

263
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:07,913
that the old Ephrem
would come back.

264
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:12,918
I couldn't wait any longer.

265
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,057
I had to leave.

266
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:21,894
I didn't want Kenya to think

267
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:25,998
that that was what
love looked like.

268
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,978
You know, after all of that,

269
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:43,315
you know what she said
to me the other day?

270
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:47,319
That I should hold on.

271
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:49,823
That somewhere
deep inside of me,

272
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,959
I still loved him, and
that I should not give up.

273
00:28:57,664 --> 00:28:58,464
Amazing.

274
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,370
Well, Rae, I
just, I don't know.

275
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:07,139
It's okay.

276
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:11,543
Hey, Miss Ariana.

277
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:12,311
Hey, Kenya.

278
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:15,481
Falani's out front, Mom.

279
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:16,248
Okay.

280
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:18,651
Bye.

281
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:19,385
Bye.

282
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:22,087
I love you.

283
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:23,656
I love you, too.

284
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:53,285
So, what's on your mind?

285
00:29:57,956 --> 00:30:01,427
How old were you when
your parents got divorced?

286
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:05,564
I was about 10, why?

287
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:13,907
Do you remember how
that made you feel?

288
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,041
Most definitely.

289
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:17,276
Please, tell me.

290
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:21,480
Well, I was mostly scared.

291
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:24,950
I think I knew things
would be changing,

292
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,618
I just didn't know how.

293
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:29,889
I think what I feared the most

294
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:31,423
is that I would miss how my dad

295
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:33,992
would tuck me in at
night and wake me

296
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:36,061
up to breakfast every morning.

297
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:37,362
I used to love that.

298
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:42,635
Is he still alive?

299
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,338
Yeah, both of my parents are,

300
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:49,575
and they both remarried,
and they're happy.

301
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:02,354
How'd it make you feel
when your parents remarried?

302
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:10,028
Well, again, looking at it
from a different perspective,

303
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:12,331
I got more gifts
during the holidays.

304
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:14,099
See?

305
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:17,135
Why'd you ask me
about the divorce?

306
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:26,144
I think if my
dad wakes back up,

307
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,579
my mom's gonna divorce him.

308
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:32,952
Don't you think you're getting
a little ahead of yourself?

309
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:35,053
I heard my mom
talking to her friend.

310
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,057
I don't think she
loves my dad anymore.

311
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:43,562
Did you hear her say that?

312
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:45,665
No.

313
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:48,367
Do you know that for sure?

314
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,134
No.

315
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:53,605
So why are you creating all
these scenarios in your mind?

316
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,208
Don't you think your plate
is full enough already?

317
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,177
Yeah, I guess.

318
00:32:04,951 --> 00:32:07,352
Well, how about this?

319
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:10,122
How about we get your dad
back up on his feet, first,

320
00:32:10,155 --> 00:32:12,725
and then we'll cross that
bridge when we get there?

321
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:15,594
Okay.

322
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:33,278
Hello?

323
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,581
- Mrs. Hall?
- Yes, speaking.

324
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:40,419
Can you
get to the hospital right away?

325
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:41,286
He's awake.

326
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,323
Okay.

327
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:49,829
I'm on my way, thank you.

328
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,444
You look beautiful.

329
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:07,680
Thank you.

330
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:11,818
Wish I could say
the same about you.

331
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:15,822
I deserve that.

332
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,662
Do you remember what happened?

333
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,398
Yeah, every detail.

334
00:33:32,105 --> 00:33:34,373
So, what happened?

335
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,177
Things got hard when you left.

336
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:43,983
I tried to replace
the loneliness

337
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:48,921
with women, drugs,
and other things.

338
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:56,629
None of it could
check the emptiness.

339
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,806
So, I decided it was
time to take my life.

340
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,580
You and Kenya

341
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,288
were the only ones
I was living for,

342
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:26,425
and, with you being gone,

343
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:31,296
I felt as though I
had no reason to live.

344
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:41,908
So I got drunk and drove
straight into a pole

345
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,944
as fast as I could.

346
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,190
So you're saying that
all of this is my fault?

347
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,457
No.

348
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,358
- Because we left.
- No, not at all.

349
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,261
I take full responsibility
for my actions.

350
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:11,838
Where's June Bug?

351
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,507
She's on her way.

352
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,644
Ariana is bringing her.

353
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,784
She know?

354
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,488
- Yes.
- Okay.

355
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,525
I need to gather myself.

356
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,264
It's taken a lot for me
to hold it all together,

357
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:41,266
especially with you being here.

358
00:35:43,136 --> 00:35:44,469
- Ephrem.
- Yeah?

359
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:49,776
What is it?

360
00:35:56,649 --> 00:36:01,854
Look, I know that you
started a new life.

361
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,524
I get it.

362
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,996
This past year has
been hard on Kenya,

363
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:13,733
not seeing you.

364
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,869
She's in counseling.

365
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:21,874
How's that going?

366
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:23,843
Pretty good.

367
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:29,916
It's a young lady from the
YMCA Big Sister's program.

368
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:32,885
Her name's Falani.

369
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:34,253
Kenya loves her.

370
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:38,390
And you?

371
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:41,393
What about you, are
you in counseling?

372
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:45,298
Yeah, Ariana.

373
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,235
How is Ariana?

374
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:52,104
Oh, you know, she
loves her cocktails.

375
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,114
Look, I'm gonna be honest,
I want my family back,

376
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:09,889
and I'm willing to use
every bit of strength

377
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:16,662
I have left to make that happen.

378
00:37:20,432 --> 00:37:22,902
You really wanna talk
about this right now?

379
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,605
Kenya's gonna be walking
through that door any second.

380
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,308
Yeah.

381
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:35,580
What do you want
from me, Ephrem?

382
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:37,449
Just because you almost died,

383
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:39,484
I'm supposed to
just open my heart

384
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,854
and let you back
in just like that?

385
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,591
No, I'm not expecting that.

386
00:37:53,598 --> 00:37:56,068
Whatever you're willing
to give, I'll take it.

387
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,845
I understand the risk

388
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,585
of not being able
to win you back,

389
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:18,724
but I love you, and I'm
willing to fight for us.

390
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,405
- Daddy!
- June Bug!

391
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,559
Jesus Christ, Rae,
talk about drama.

392
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:58,097
And that's not all of it.

393
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:00,633
All right, give me a second.

394
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,839
Let me get another one.

395
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:19,085
All right, hit me.

396
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:26,726
Ephrem said he was gonna
fight for our marriage.

397
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:30,963
How you feel about that?

398
00:39:30,997 --> 00:39:31,731
Bittersweet.

399
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:35,735
How's the BF?

400
00:39:39,205 --> 00:39:40,039
Bittersweet.

401
00:39:42,274 --> 00:39:43,776
Bittersweet, huh?

402
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:47,847
Sounds like a great
name for a cocktail.

403
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,515
Yeah.

404
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:06,531
What?

405
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:12,271
Beautiful.

406
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,141
Thank you.

407
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:23,883
Yeah, Kenya's father woke
up from his coma yesterday.

408
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:24,650
Wow.

409
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,821
That's good, that's good.

410
00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:31,657
It is.

411
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:36,662
I'm not telling you that for
the reason you might assume.

412
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:39,732
- Look, Raven-
- No.

413
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,168
Let me finish.

414
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:51,644
Ephrem and I were high
school sweethearts,

415
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,215
so our ties, they run deep.

416
00:40:57,817 --> 00:41:00,653
Outside of him, you are the only

417
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:02,721
other relationship
I've ever had.

418
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:07,059
I need you to know that.

419
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,334
I don't know what the
future holds for us,

420
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:19,572
but if we decide
to move forward-

421
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:22,441
- If we decide to move-

422
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:23,576
- It's important for you to know

423
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:26,712
that Ephrem will always
be a part of my life,

424
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:29,014
especially since we have
a daughter together.

425
00:41:29,048 --> 00:41:29,782
Yeah.

426
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:35,488
You know, not too long
ago, not too long ago,

427
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:38,324
we decided that this
was more than just sex.

428
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:40,759
Now it's it.

429
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:44,463
I wish you'd stop doing that.

430
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:45,231
Doing what?

431
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:51,670
- You know-
- Forcing my hand.

432
00:41:51,704 --> 00:41:52,805
Forcing your hand?

433
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:55,374
Forcing your hand?

434
00:41:57,243 --> 00:41:58,144
I'm just stating facts.

435
00:41:58,177 --> 00:41:59,445
You know what I mean.

436
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:00,479
No, I don't.

437
00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:01,180
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

438
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:02,181
Yes, you do!

439
00:42:05,551 --> 00:42:10,689
You know, we
started here, right?

440
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,660
Now we're here.

441
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:18,797
What changed?

442
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,334
You know what changed.

443
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:23,169
No, I don't.

444
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:23,936
He's alive.

445
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:26,972
Thank God, he's alive.

446
00:42:28,774 --> 00:42:30,509
I don't understand
why things can't go

447
00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:31,810
back to the way they were.

448
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:34,046
We had something,
we have something.

449
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,084
You're right.

450
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:45,858
Everything you said,
you're right, okay?

451
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,867
I just need you to get out
of your own head space,

452
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,770
and step into mine,
just for a second.

453
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,212
Everything for you, everything
for you is black and white.

454
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:13,986
For me, there's a lot
of gray, a lot of gray,

455
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:18,991
and I need to try and
make sense of it all.

456
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:27,199
I mean, the consequences
for the decisions

457
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:29,401
that I have to make
are far-reaching,

458
00:43:31,638 --> 00:43:33,739
not just for myself,
but for everyone.

459
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:41,080
I just need more time
to figure things out.

460
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:47,353
I'm sorry if you
can't understand that.

461
00:43:47,386 --> 00:43:48,120
I'm trying.

462
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:53,559
I'm trying to understand.

463
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:54,293
So am I.

464
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:01,500
So am I.

465
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:05,564
You haven't changed a thing.

466
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,545
Really, Ephrem?

467
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:28,887
Kenya, come help me
clean this kitchen.

468
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:57,476
Let's not even talk about UNO.

469
00:46:57,509 --> 00:46:59,044
I had to draw 20.

470
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:01,947
I remember that day.

471
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,205
Just
like old times, huh?

472
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:27,206
Yeah.

473
00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:46,926
Ephrem, what are you gonna
do about your drinking?

474
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:54,166
Since I got out of the coma,

475
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,201
I haven't had the urge to drink.

476
00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:58,537
Can't explain it.

477
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:03,542
What about when it comes back.

478
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:04,744
If it comes back.

479
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,311
Okay, if it comes back.

480
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:13,018
I don't know, I haven't
thought that far yet.

481
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:15,120
I'm just happy to be alive

482
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:18,023
and spend time with
my family again.

483
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:28,968
What's funny?

484
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:41,179
You remember that time
when I walked into the room

485
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:43,415
and I walked into the room naked

486
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:47,152
while you and Kenya
were watching a movie?

487
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:49,756
Of course, how could I forget?

488
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:54,192
You know how mad I was at her?

489
00:48:56,663 --> 00:48:57,496
Yeah.

490
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:09,008
I was so embarrassed,
I just sent her to bed.

491
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:11,343
She didn't do anything wrong.

492
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:14,479
I love that girl.

493
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:21,186
Yeah.

494
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,691
What made you think about that?

495
00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:27,694
Oh, it just popped in my head.

496
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,745
I'm sorry for everything
I put you through,

497
00:49:48,748 --> 00:49:50,984
everything I put y'all through.

498
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:02,862
I better be going.

499
00:50:04,363 --> 00:50:06,164
I'm gonna let Kenya sleep.

500
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:15,742
Raven.

501
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:19,311
Thank you.

502
00:50:22,048 --> 00:50:23,816
Mm hmm, good night.

503
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:53,438
Hi, baby.

504
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,876
You just
missed breakfast.

505
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:58,745
Oh, really, what did I miss?

506
00:51:58,778 --> 00:52:01,346
I made turkey
bacon and pancakes.

507
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:04,382
Oh, how was it?

508
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,585
It was good, it was good.

509
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:10,455
Great.

510
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:13,291
There's some leftovers
if you want some.

511
00:52:13,325 --> 00:52:14,593
No, thank you, sweetheart,

512
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:17,096
but I can help you
clean up the kitchen.

513
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,564
No, I
think I got that.

514
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:20,332
Okay.

515
00:52:25,537 --> 00:52:28,406
Can I talk to you for a second?

516
00:52:30,176 --> 00:52:31,010
Sure.

517
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:34,479
Hey, Kenya, can you
give your Dad and I

518
00:52:34,513 --> 00:52:36,414
a moment alone, please?

519
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:58,303
What's up, Raven?

520
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:08,480
Do you remember that
starting a new life comment

521
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:12,718
you made back at the hospital?

522
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,554
Yeah.

523
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:25,363
Oh.

524
00:53:29,268 --> 00:53:32,504
How long have you
been seeing him?

525
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,407
Six months.

526
00:53:36,843 --> 00:53:37,677
Oh.

527
00:53:39,377 --> 00:53:40,545
Is it serious?

528
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:45,584
Yeah.

529
00:53:49,722 --> 00:53:50,890
How serious?

530
00:53:56,262 --> 00:53:58,597
Unprotected sex serious.

531
00:54:00,465 --> 00:54:02,902
You're kidding me, right?

532
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:05,403
No.

533
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:19,652
You're not gonna make
this easy, are you?

534
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,458
Apparently not.

535
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:30,663
Wow, Raven.

536
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:33,132
What?

537
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:34,532
Don't worry, it's not like

538
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:37,203
I'm gonna get
pregnant or anything.

539
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:38,871
We're being safe.

540
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:41,173
Oh, really,
that's good to know.

541
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:41,941
Good to know.

542
00:54:46,478 --> 00:54:50,548
So, that's it,
that's my new life.

543
00:54:58,324 --> 00:55:00,192
Well, you got a
decision to make.

544
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:00,993
I'll flip a coin.

545
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:05,197
Heads, me, tails,
your boyfriend.

546
00:55:07,066 --> 00:55:10,502
Whatever.

547
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:18,110
You're not upset?

548
00:55:20,313 --> 00:55:21,714
Of course I am.

549
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:45,204
What happened to you?

550
00:55:47,505 --> 00:55:48,774
I don't know.

551
00:55:51,177 --> 00:55:53,245
I guess I bumped my head.

552
00:56:23,209 --> 00:56:24,643
Where are you going, Mom?

553
00:56:24,677 --> 00:56:26,979
I have to
meet with someone.

554
00:56:27,013 --> 00:56:29,514
I'll be back later
to pick you up.

555
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:31,764
Hi, Mom.

556
00:59:31,797 --> 00:59:32,798
Hey, I'm here.

557
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:34,133
- Come outside.
- Okay.

558
01:00:06,932 --> 01:00:08,234
Kenya, what's wrong?

559
01:00:11,671 --> 01:00:17,109
K-K, did something
happen at your father's?

560
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:18,444
No.

561
01:00:18,477 --> 01:00:19,778
Then what is it?

562
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:20,647
You, Mom!

563
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,081
You're the problem.

564
01:00:22,114 --> 01:00:24,718
Whoa, what are
you talking about?

565
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:26,051
You see that Dad needs you.

566
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:28,854
Why would you continue
dating that man?

567
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:30,623
Look, you are starting
to cross the line.

568
01:00:30,657 --> 01:00:32,726
No, Mom, you're
crossing the line.

569
01:00:32,758 --> 01:00:33,926
We never should've left.

570
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:35,094
We never should...

571
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:56,181
Kenya, things happened
between your father and I

572
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,019
that I do not expect
you to understand,

573
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:06,058
but us leaving at that time,
that was the best decision.

574
01:01:08,494 --> 01:01:11,930
I'm sorry I wasn't honest with
you about what was going on.

575
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:17,303
Your father did things to me

576
01:01:17,336 --> 01:01:22,441
that no one should
have to go through.

577
01:01:28,547 --> 01:01:30,049
I know what's going on.

578
01:01:31,283 --> 01:01:34,219
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

579
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:38,057
I just want us to be
back together so bad.

580
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:43,962
Oh, Kenya.

581
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:52,104
Truth is, I do still
love your father.

582
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:56,975
To be honest, I'm
still in love with him.

583
01:01:59,978 --> 01:02:01,246
I'm just scared.

584
01:02:04,883 --> 01:02:06,318
To be honest, I'm terrified.

585
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,993
We'll be okay.

586
01:02:17,896 --> 01:02:21,467
Everything will work out
the way it's supposed to.

587
01:02:48,862 --> 01:02:50,764
I've been going
through a lot lately,

588
01:02:50,797 --> 01:02:52,164
and I'm just...

589
01:02:55,334 --> 01:02:57,936
You're the only one
on my side right now,

590
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:58,937
other than June Bug.

591
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:02,241
I just need somebody
to pick me up.

592
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:08,882
Jada, look, when I got
out of the hospital,

593
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:10,215
I came out of that coma,

594
01:03:13,986 --> 01:03:15,454
I was different, changed.

595
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:19,358
I haven't had a drink since.

596
01:03:22,327 --> 01:03:25,899
Truth is, my priority right now

597
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:29,968
is just getting my wife
and my daughter back.

598
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:32,004
I look at you, I watch you,

599
01:03:33,138 --> 01:03:38,510
and you're not the same Jada
from 10 years ago, you know?

600
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:43,048
But you just glow.

601
01:03:46,151 --> 01:03:48,688
You don't drink,
you don't smoke.

602
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:50,489
Nothing phases you.

603
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:55,627
That strength, you know, you
just have it all figured out.

604
01:03:57,196 --> 01:03:58,964
You're on top of your game.

605
01:03:59,899 --> 01:04:01,935
Maybe what I'm saying
is I just wanna be

606
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,302
more like my baby sis.

607
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:07,439
While I might look like I
have it all together, right,

608
01:04:07,473 --> 01:04:11,443
I appreciate that compliment,
this is a practice, you know?

609
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:17,382
I gotta get up every day and
start over again, you know?

610
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:19,518
I have my own
affirmation recordings.

611
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:23,088
You know, you being
in that accident

612
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:24,590
was a huge trigger for me.

613
01:04:26,024 --> 01:04:30,429
It brought back all the
things that we experienced

614
01:04:30,462 --> 01:04:32,164
as kids, and things
that I thought

615
01:04:32,197 --> 01:04:34,266
I had gotten rid
of a long time ago.

616
01:04:34,299 --> 01:04:36,301
This what I want you to do.

617
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:39,505
Write down everything that
you don't like about yourself,

618
01:04:40,673 --> 01:04:45,077
everything you wanna change,
and I mean everything.

619
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,578
I
believe I'm a failure.

620
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:49,248
I don't feel worthy.

621
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:52,317
I'm an alcoholic.

622
01:04:53,418 --> 01:04:57,824
I don't take full
responsibility for my actions.

623
01:04:57,857 --> 01:05:00,459
I blame everyone for
my circumstances.

624
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:06,031
I resent my mother
for not protecting me.

625
01:05:06,064 --> 01:05:09,234
I resent my father
for abusing my mother.

626
01:05:10,602 --> 01:05:12,237
I lose focus easy.

627
01:05:13,006 --> 01:05:14,974
I give up easy.

628
01:05:18,978 --> 01:05:22,180
Burn the things that
you don't like, right?

629
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:23,950
So that the whole idea
is to just get rid

630
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:26,019
of the things that
you don't like.

631
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:30,556
So after you write
down all the things

632
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:32,524
that you don't like
about yourself.

633
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,028
You're gonna take those things

634
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,628
and write an affirmation
for each one.

635
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:41,433
So, for instance,
"I'm an alcoholic."

636
01:05:42,635 --> 01:05:45,905
You're gonna transform that
into a word or a phrase

637
01:05:45,939 --> 01:05:48,273
that makes you feel empowered.

638
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:52,210
Most people will be tempted
to say something like,

639
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:54,146
"I don't drink alcohol anymore,"

640
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:55,882
or "I don't have the desire to."

641
01:05:55,915 --> 01:05:57,516
But you actually
wanna write something

642
01:05:57,549 --> 01:06:01,286
like "I only drink things
that make me feel healthy."

643
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,421
Does that make sense?

644
01:06:03,823 --> 01:06:07,326
I accept
people for who they are.

645
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,095
I accept the things
I cannot change.

646
01:06:12,065 --> 01:06:14,232
I only eat food that
will nourish my body.

647
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:18,972
I'm accepting of the mistakes
that others have made

648
01:06:19,005 --> 01:06:20,640
that may have affected my life.

649
01:06:21,674 --> 01:06:25,310
I appreciate my family,
friends, and loved ones.

650
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:28,715
I'm successful in all that I do.

651
01:06:31,084 --> 01:06:32,986
I am a loving husband.

652
01:06:33,019 --> 01:06:34,119
I am a loving father.

653
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,156
I'm focused on
accomplishing my goals.

654
01:06:59,012 --> 01:07:01,213
So, how you been, Rae?

655
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,248
Maintaining.

656
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,317
Maintaining?

657
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,853
Well, maintaining is good.

658
01:07:10,355 --> 01:07:11,924
What about you?

659
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:14,259
I'm good.

660
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,595
So, any new developments?

661
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:21,333
I guess you can say that.

662
01:07:22,234 --> 01:07:26,304
Kenya and I had a
little spat.

663
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:27,774
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

664
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:32,712
She really wants her dad
and I to get back together.

665
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:36,415
Can't say that I blame her.

666
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:39,351
She's only 13, still innocent.

667
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:42,187
I guess.

668
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,691
You know, when Ephrem and I
dated back in high school,

669
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,460
those were the
days of innocence.

670
01:07:50,763 --> 01:07:51,664
I miss those days.

671
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:57,737
Still love him, don't you?

672
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,374
Yeah.

673
01:08:06,846 --> 01:08:11,784
I've tried shielding Kenya
from pain her whole life.

674
01:08:13,152 --> 01:08:16,723
You know, protect her innocence.

675
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,593
But it's impossible.

676
01:08:24,197 --> 01:08:25,965
'Cause at some point, you know,

677
01:08:27,432 --> 01:08:32,638
pain and innocence,
they will cross paths.

678
01:08:37,176 --> 01:08:38,911
When they do, it
just feels like,

679
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,581
feels like you're
tainted for life.

680
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,719
Nah, you did good, Rae.

681
01:08:47,854 --> 01:08:51,490
Some kids get tainted
way younger than 13.

682
01:08:57,395 --> 01:08:59,531
Hey, what happened?

683
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:09,474
Good ole uncle.

684
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:11,510
Everybody has one.

685
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:16,548
You stayed with your
husband two years too long.

686
01:09:17,817 --> 01:09:19,417
The minute he put his hands
on you, you should've left.

687
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:23,689
Don't ever regret your
decision for leaving.

688
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:31,396
Now, whether you
should take him back.

689
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:40,539
You know what I love about
my relationship with Quinn?

690
01:09:40,572 --> 01:09:41,974
What?

691
01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:45,343
The innocence.

692
01:09:45,377 --> 01:09:48,513
Innocence, I don't
know about that.

693
01:09:48,547 --> 01:09:51,818
I mean, he's never hurt me.

694
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:53,719
Hmm.

695
01:09:57,757 --> 01:09:58,590
What?

696
01:10:00,193 --> 01:10:01,526
Just a matter of time.

697
01:10:02,594 --> 01:10:05,998
I mean, he's gonna hurt
you, you're gonna hurt him.

698
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:07,532
We're human, it's what we do.

699
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:25,051
So, Dad's back home.

700
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:27,053
Yes, congratulations!

701
01:10:27,086 --> 01:10:28,353
I'm so happy to hear that.

702
01:10:28,386 --> 01:10:29,822
Thank you.

703
01:10:29,856 --> 01:10:32,825
So, how's everything
been since he's been back?

704
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:33,659
It's been great.

705
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:35,393
I spend a lot of time with him.

706
01:10:35,427 --> 01:10:37,029
That's good, and your mom?

707
01:10:38,898 --> 01:10:41,433
Well, she comes around,

708
01:10:41,466 --> 01:10:43,602
but I think she's still
seeing her boyfriend, though.

709
01:10:43,636 --> 01:10:45,905
I see, and how does
this make you feel?

710
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:51,911
Angry, but I understand
he put her through a lot.

711
01:10:51,944 --> 01:10:53,179
Right.

712
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:55,314
But why can't she
just forgive him?

713
01:10:55,348 --> 01:10:57,083
Well, how do you
know she hasn't?

714
01:10:57,116 --> 01:10:58,317
If she would have forgave him,

715
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:00,119
she would've taken him back.

716
01:11:00,152 --> 01:11:02,487
He's not the same, I can tell.

717
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:05,691
Well, just because
she's forgiven him

718
01:11:05,725 --> 01:11:08,027
doesn't mean she
necessarily wants him back.

719
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,462
You know, she remembers
the pain he caused her,

720
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:11,664
and memory can be good.

721
01:11:11,697 --> 01:11:13,398
It's a sign of protection.

722
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:15,968
Just like, you wouldn't
go put your hands

723
01:11:16,002 --> 01:11:18,137
on a hot stove, would you?

724
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,372
No.

725
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:20,706
And why, because you
remember the first time

726
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,875
you did that, you
burnt yourself, right?

727
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:25,577
Yeah, I guess.

728
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:54,640
So, how ya been?

729
01:11:58,978 --> 01:12:00,046
It's been difficult.

730
01:12:06,085 --> 01:12:06,886
How's your husband?

731
01:12:09,021 --> 01:12:10,022
He's improving.

732
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:12,024
That's good.

733
01:12:12,058 --> 01:12:14,226
Kenya's been spending
a lot of time with him.

734
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:22,368
How have you been?

735
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:23,135
It's been difficult.

736
01:12:24,804 --> 01:12:25,638
I'm sure.

737
01:12:26,973 --> 01:12:29,541
So where do you stand,
you know, regarding us?

738
01:12:33,012 --> 01:12:33,846
Hmm?

739
01:12:36,015 --> 01:12:37,183
I don't know.

740
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:46,624
I'm thinking that I'm gonna
spend some time to myself.

741
01:12:49,395 --> 01:12:50,495
- Okay, right.
- And raise Kenya

742
01:12:50,528 --> 01:12:51,496
- as a single mother.
- So you're just

743
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:53,065
gonna take the easy way out?

744
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:53,933
- Easy?
- Yeah.

745
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:56,601
- Wow.
- By not making a decision.

746
01:12:56,635 --> 01:12:59,839
Look, you, you
are something else.

747
01:12:59,872 --> 01:13:02,641
I need time.

748
01:13:02,675 --> 01:13:03,608
- I need time.
- Look, Raven,

749
01:13:03,642 --> 01:13:04,509
- look, Raven-
- You keep pressing

750
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:05,644
- me for answers.
- Raven.

751
01:13:05,678 --> 01:13:06,278
- I need time.
- Raven.

752
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:07,246
What?

753
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:08,580
I have a new opportunity.

754
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:09,782
My company's expanding.

755
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:13,486
We're opening a new
office in Florida,

756
01:13:13,518 --> 01:13:16,122
which I'm gonna have to
go and oversee, all right?

757
01:13:16,155 --> 01:13:20,525
I'm hoping that you,
Kenya, will come with me.

758
01:13:21,494 --> 01:13:23,561
We can start a new
family, all right?

759
01:13:23,595 --> 01:13:24,864
We can get married.

760
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:27,967
I love you.

761
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:33,105
I love you.

762
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:42,715
I couldn't take Kenya
away from her father.

763
01:13:46,685 --> 01:13:49,554
I was afraid you'd say that.

764
01:13:52,525 --> 01:13:56,594
I guess I just made your
decision much easier, huh?

765
01:13:56,628 --> 01:13:58,097
Why are you doing this?

766
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:03,202
Don't look at me like that.

767
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:07,706
Just...

768
01:14:08,774 --> 01:14:09,574
God.

769
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:14,647
I never thought that.

770
01:14:15,915 --> 01:14:18,651
What'd you think
was happening, huh?

771
01:14:19,617 --> 01:14:21,921
It's like you told
me, life's difficult.

772
01:14:21,954 --> 01:14:23,122
It's not just black and white.

773
01:14:23,155 --> 01:14:25,691
There's a lot of gray
areas, all right?

774
01:14:25,724 --> 01:14:27,860
Divorces, car accidents.

775
01:14:28,494 --> 01:14:30,429
You know, that's life.

776
01:14:30,463 --> 01:14:31,764
You just gotta deal with it.

777
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:38,838
I'm sorry.

778
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:41,974
Where you going?

779
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:49,648
Yeah, that's right.

780
01:14:49,682 --> 01:14:52,051
Yeah, that's right, go back
to your abusive husband.

781
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:28,087
Ephrem,
I'm afraid of you.

782
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:36,795
I know.

783
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:43,903
I still love you.

784
01:15:47,072 --> 01:15:47,907
Yeah?

785
01:15:52,711 --> 01:15:54,213
I just don't know what to do.

786
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,020
Who says we have to
make a decision right now?

787
01:16:01,053 --> 01:16:01,887
There's time.

788
01:16:05,824 --> 01:16:08,227
We have a beautiful
daughter that loves us.

789
01:16:09,395 --> 01:16:12,298
Let's just focus on her and
let the rest work itself out.

790
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:18,938
Quinn's moving.

791
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:26,612
His company is opening
a new office in Florida.

792
01:16:26,646 --> 01:16:28,914
He wants me and
Kenya to go with him.

793
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:39,959
And?

794
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:47,800
I think you know
the answer to that.

795
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:16,795
I only eat food

796
01:17:16,829 --> 01:17:17,963
that will nourish my body.

797
01:17:22,702 --> 01:17:26,105
I appreciate my family,
friends, and loved ones.

798
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:35,147
I accept people
for who they are.

799
01:17:39,285 --> 01:17:42,087
I accept the things
I cannot change.

800
01:17:46,558 --> 01:17:48,927
I'm successful in all that I do.

801
01:17:56,869 --> 01:17:59,605
I'm accepting of
mistakes others have made

802
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:01,307
that may have affected my life.

803
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:08,080
I'm focused on
accomplishing my goals.

804
01:18:10,382 --> 01:18:13,285
I am a loving husband,
I am a loving father.

805
01:19:10,142 --> 01:19:12,679
You know, the
last time I craved ice cream

806
01:19:12,712 --> 01:19:13,879
at two o'clock in the morning,

807
01:19:13,912 --> 01:19:18,117
nine months later, Kenya
made her grand entrance.

808
01:19:20,953 --> 01:19:22,354
Did you get a test yet?

809
01:19:22,388 --> 01:19:23,355
Yes!

810
01:19:24,323 --> 01:19:25,157
And?

811
01:19:25,991 --> 01:19:27,861
I'm pregnant.

812
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:29,094
What?

813
01:19:29,128 --> 01:19:30,362
I thought you said
he had a vasectomy?

814
01:19:30,396 --> 01:19:31,330
He did!

815
01:19:32,598 --> 01:19:37,336
I mean, at least, almost five
months into our relationship.

816
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:42,007
And did he ever get a
final sperm count test?

817
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:44,977
What, what is that?

818
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:48,681
I don't know, he never
mentioned anything about that.

819
01:19:48,715 --> 01:19:49,915
Well, that explains it.

820
01:19:49,948 --> 01:19:51,950
He was supposed to go
back to the surgeon

821
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:53,352
and make sure the
sperm count was zero

822
01:19:53,385 --> 01:19:55,320
before having
unprotected sex again.

823
01:19:58,424 --> 01:19:59,224
Wow.

824
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:01,994
Wow is right.

825
01:20:02,027 --> 01:20:03,595
Hello?

826
01:20:03,629 --> 01:20:06,231
Hey, are you busy?

827
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:09,201
No, what's up?

828
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,204
Can you
meet me at our spot?

829
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:16,141
Okay, sure, what time?

830
01:20:18,143 --> 01:20:20,512
In about an hour.

831
01:20:20,546 --> 01:20:22,047
Okay, see you soon.

832
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:45,204
What's wrong?

833
01:20:45,905 --> 01:20:47,105
I'm pregnant.

834
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:49,341
What?

835
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:53,579
How, how?

836
01:20:57,516 --> 01:20:58,450
How's this happening?

837
01:20:58,484 --> 01:20:59,451
I had the vasectomy.

838
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,021
Did you get the final
sperm count report?

839
01:21:03,055 --> 01:21:05,959
The doctor said I should
be clear in 30 days.

840
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:07,794
Yeah, but did he
tell you to come back

841
01:21:07,827 --> 01:21:09,127
and get the final
sperm count report

842
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:11,230
before having unprotected sex?

843
01:21:11,263 --> 01:21:12,197
Yes.

844
01:21:14,968 --> 01:21:16,068
What, you don't believe me?

845
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:22,207
So what do you wanna do?

846
01:21:22,241 --> 01:21:23,910
What do I wanna do?

847
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:25,477
What do you want me to do?

848
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:29,147
It's not like I'm gonna be
around to help you with it.

849
01:21:33,452 --> 01:21:34,988
- What?
- I can't do this right now.

850
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:39,124
So you're just gonna
leave, huh, just gonna leave?

851
01:21:39,157 --> 01:21:40,392
You walk back into my life,

852
01:21:40,425 --> 01:21:43,930
you tell me you're
pregnant, and then you leave

853
01:21:43,963 --> 01:21:45,297
without a plan?

854
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:51,136
Do you even care what I'm
going through right now?

855
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:53,505
Of course I care!

856
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:55,274
I wouldn't have come
back to tell you

857
01:21:55,307 --> 01:21:57,476
that I was pregnant
if I didn't care.

858
01:21:58,477 --> 01:22:01,648
It's not like I planned
any of this to happen.

859
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:04,082
I'm not a psychic, I didn't know

860
01:22:04,116 --> 01:22:07,252
that any of this
was going to happen.

861
01:22:09,889 --> 01:22:11,490
I have a daughter.

862
01:22:11,523 --> 01:22:14,092
I have a daughter that
adores her father.

863
01:22:14,126 --> 01:22:16,996
Why she adores him, I
will never understand,

864
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:19,598
after everything that
he has done to me.

865
01:22:19,632 --> 01:22:22,568
But if I turn my back
on him right now,

866
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:23,703
she'll never forgive me.

867
01:22:24,603 --> 01:22:25,604
Do you understand that?

868
01:22:25,638 --> 01:22:27,674
She will never forgive me!

869
01:22:28,942 --> 01:22:31,577
As for this baby.

870
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,680
As for this baby,
it took you, what,

871
01:22:33,713 --> 01:22:36,381
a matter of seconds to
decide what should be done,

872
01:22:36,415 --> 01:22:39,518
so, as far as I'm
concerned, I am on my own.

873
01:22:42,254 --> 01:22:43,355
I'm sorry, Raven.

874
01:22:45,557 --> 01:22:46,458
I'm sorry.

875
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:47,225
Yeah, so am I!

876
01:23:17,824 --> 01:23:21,360
Ephrem, I've figured
out what I'm going to do.

877
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:24,864
Okay.

878
01:23:27,834 --> 01:23:31,536
I'm going to raise my
kids as a single parent.

879
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:34,641
Kids?

880
01:23:36,241 --> 01:23:38,377
I'm pregnant.

881
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:39,144
What?

882
01:23:41,179 --> 01:23:42,682
I just found out.

883
01:23:42,715 --> 01:23:43,415
Wow.

884
01:23:44,884 --> 01:23:46,819
Oh, Quinn, he had a vasectomy,

885
01:23:46,853 --> 01:23:52,859
and we didn't wait for the
final sperm count report

886
01:23:52,892 --> 01:23:54,359
before having sex.

887
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,362
Raven, you're
smarter than that.

888
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:00,532
I thought so, too.

889
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:11,376
What does he have
to say about this?

890
01:24:19,152 --> 01:24:20,753
He doesn't want me to have it.

891
01:24:28,226 --> 01:24:33,432
Look, Ephrem, I'm going
to have this baby.

892
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:40,272
I've already been
raising Kenya on my own

893
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:42,340
this past year, anyway, so,

894
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:47,579
that's what I'm going to do.

895
01:24:50,348 --> 01:24:53,886
I'm not looking
for your opinion,

896
01:24:57,156 --> 01:25:00,860
not your help, not
even your sympathy.

897
01:25:06,032 --> 01:25:07,332
It's my decision.

898
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:15,775
I will figure this out.

899
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:19,578
I'll figure it out.

900
01:25:20,847 --> 01:25:21,681
Raven.

901
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:27,419
Sit down, please.

902
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:36,796
I don't want you to
keep walking out on me.

903
01:25:42,168 --> 01:25:43,435
This is all my fault.

904
01:25:45,337 --> 01:25:49,441
You were my family,
and I pushed you away,

905
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:55,081
pushed you into the
arms of another man,

906
01:25:55,114 --> 01:25:56,515
and that would
have never happened

907
01:25:56,548 --> 01:26:02,420
if I loved you the way
you deserve to be loved.

908
01:26:07,592 --> 01:26:10,930
You're a phenomenal,
phenomenal woman,

909
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:14,599
with a lot of love
to give her man,

910
01:26:14,634 --> 01:26:17,302
and if the price for my sins

911
01:26:22,374 --> 01:26:26,679
is to raise another man's child,

912
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:33,318
with my wife, then so be it.

913
01:26:35,387 --> 01:26:36,421
You're worth it.

914
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:40,660
And I love you.

915
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:46,364
I love you.

916
01:27:10,318 --> 01:27:15,318
