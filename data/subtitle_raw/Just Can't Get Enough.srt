00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:29,967
[screaming]

2
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:54,067
I don't care if it's a
mob-owned club! I don't even care

3
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:58,067
if it's a Jesus H. Christ owned
club. We can't do the gig!

4
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:02,067
Is this Chippendales?
Auditions aren't until next week.

5
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:06,100
Are you Nick Denoia?
It depends on who's asking.

6
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,100
Nick was many things to many

7
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,100
people. Artist. Visionary. A
pain in the ass. An inspiration.

8
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,100
A man who made Chippendales.
But I'll tell you, the last thing any of

9
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,133
expected him to be was the end
of an era.

10
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,133
When Chippendales first opened,
he was a popular

11
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:30,133
backgammon club. But his tastes
changed, so did the entertainment.

12
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:34,167
Some mud wrestling led to a
ladies night or two, then three.

13
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:38,200
The crowds of women wouldn't
let up, Chippendales became the first ex

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,200
all-male strip bar. Before you
could say "it's raining men"

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Chippendales had gotten quite a
reputation. Take Spencer

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,200
for instance. He stood outside
eery night hoping to be discovered

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,233
and hired to dance inside. You
see, the secret

18
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:58,233
was getting out. Chippendales
not only had the most women in one place

19
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:02,233
time, it had the most horny
women in one place at one time.

20
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:06,233
Why? Because these ladies

21
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:10,233
bought what we were selling. A
fantasy.

22
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:14,267
The last thing

23
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:18,267
they wanted to know was that
Royce here had a wife and a kid

24
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:22,267
waiting for him at home.
Put those hands together and

25
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:26,267
spread those legs apart. I have
a gentleman I want you to meet.

26
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:30,267
Or that Clayton was only
interested in dating casting directors

27
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:34,267
to help his acting career. And
he had a sixty-eight year-old sugar mama

28
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:38,300
who paid his bills.

29
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Or, that of all people, he,
Steve Banerjee, was the one

30
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,333
who thought this whole
Chippendales thing up. The fantasy was h

31
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,333
A fantasy that was too much for
even me

32
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,333
to resist.
This is stupid. Man, I don't even know w

33
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:58,367
Fresh off the bus? Let me guess.

34
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:02,400
Iowa.
Close.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Orange Country. Just moved up here with

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Yep.
The money.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,433
You're here for the money.

38
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:18,467
Steve may have asked you to
come in here, but he's a guy.

39
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:22,467
Hey. He doesn't really know
what the ladies like, so if you wanna ge

40
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:26,467
Steve that the ladies love you.
Trade secret?

41
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:30,500
Look each and every one of them
in the eyes. Like you're about to penetr

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Even the fatties. Okay? Give
them the ride of their lives.

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,500
*

44
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:54,567
* It's raining men, hallelujah

45
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,567
* It's raining men

46
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:02,567
Hey, hey

47
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes, Mr. Banerjee

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,633
Hey, call me steve. The ladies,
they desire you.

49
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:18,633
I think they will be happier
with the tips

50
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,633
The revue will be your new job.

51
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:26,667
And so, there I was. The
fantasy.

52
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:30,667
A Chippendale.

53
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,733
Will? What has gotten into you?

54
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:42,733
I have some good news.
Go on.

55
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,733
While you were at work, I

56
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:50,767
was at work.
Oh my god!

57
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:54,767
That's awesome. You got a job?
Yeah, Chippendales.

58
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:58,800
As in the dancing guys?
Yeah. I was right here yesterday, laying

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
the owner discovered me. Isn't
that great?

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
No. That's majorly lame.

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,833
You just got your Masters in
Business. What about owning

62
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,833
your own company? Are you just
going to throw it all away?

63
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,867
No. I'm going to learn how to
run a business first hand.

64
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:22,900
And then I'm going to move on.
Heather, the money is so good. I mean, w

65
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,900
need the money.
Not that bad.

66
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,900
What would you rather have? Me or this j
Heather,

67
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,933
don't do this.
Wrong answer.

68
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,933
Heather.

69
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,967
We've done spot checks three
nights this week.

70
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,967
Each and every time, there's
been a drastic violation of fire code.

71
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:50,967
Is it because you are afraid of
the sexuality

72
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:55,067
of the men that you give me
such a difficult time?

73
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:59,067
No, it's because you're breaking the law
I can only make

74
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,067
a profit by fitting more women
than your capacity allows.

75
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:07,067
Please. Is there anything I can
do?

76
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:11,067
Follow the fire safety
regulations.

77
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:15,567
And lose the extra money?
That I cannot do.

78
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:19,567
If you continue with the
violations, the city will shit you down

79
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:23,600
Now, I suggest you take care of
the over crowding, or we will

80
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
do it for you.

81
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Hello ladies, welcome to
Chippendales. I'll be your host

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,633
My name is Chad. Where are you
all from?

83
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:39,633
Santa Monica.
You all ready to have a good time?
Yeah!

84
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:43,667
That's too bad. Because I'm
going show you

85
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:47,667
a great time!
You better, because if you don't I'm goi

86
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:51,700
sue you for false advertising.
Oh really? We have a lawyer in the house

87
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
First year of law school, UCLA.
Ah. MBA,

88
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,733
UC Irvine.

89
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:03,733
Maybe you could save some room
for

90
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:07,733
a little dessert later.

91
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:15,767
*

92
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,833
I don't know why you want to
hire a choreographer.

93
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,833
You make this show any better,
you're going to have even more

94
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,867
women crowding in here to catch
the action.

95
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:43,867
I move forward. I didn't get
the way I am today by sitting back and

96
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:47,900
bleeding down to the asphalt.
You don't have to let

97
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,900
the fire department bug you.
Never hurt anybody.

98
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Oh yeah!

99
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Well if you're hungry for more
man-loving, we've got a guy that's

100
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,900
going to satisfy your appetite.
He is

101
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,900
the unknown, the stripper!

102
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,067
*

103
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:20,267
Maybe I can offer them a gift.

104
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:24,267
Say, of, ten thousand dollars.

105
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:28,267
To turn the other face, huh?
I don't know, Steve.

106
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,333
Then how much for you to scare
the fire department?

107
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,333
Excuse me?
A bomb.

108
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,333
Maybe that will get them off my
back.

109
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:48,367
You want to burn down the fire
department?

110
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:52,367
Maybe you should be running a
comedy club, Steve, because

111
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:56,367
that's real fucking funny.

112
00:08:56,367 --> 00:09:08,400
*

113
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,400
[screaming]

114
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:24,467
Sorry, excuse me.
Wanna finish her off?

115
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:28,500
I have to go, I'm up next.

116
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Not tonight, love to help you
out.

117
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Hi Chad.

118
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,533
Uh, girlfriend.
So do I. And

119
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:48,533
she'll be happy to join us.
Hi.

120
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:52,567
Hi.

121
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:04,600

122
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,633

Oh my god!

124
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Hey, how about a toast?

125
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,733
To the overeducated, and the
undersexed.

126
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:44,733
You or me?
I don't even know you.

127
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,767
To tell you the truth,

128
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,800
You're really not that far off.

129
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
We should fix that.

130
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I can't.
I'm usually not so easy, this is

131
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,833
a limited offer.
Really, I can't.

132
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,867
Girlfriend.

133
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:12,867
Seven years. Since high school.

134
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:16,867
No itch to scratch?
Nope.

135
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:20,900
She's lucky.

136
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Sorry.

137
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:52,967
*

138
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:17,067
Kill the music.

139
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:25,100
Take it off! Take it off!
You got a court order or something?

140
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Take it off!

141
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,133
It's your show now, buddy.

142
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:37,133
Take it off! Take it off!

143
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,167
Excuse me. I'm going to have to
ask you to walk

144
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:49,167
slowly and carefully to the
exits.

145
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,167
Chippendales Nightclub is
closed for business.

146
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:57,200
Boo!

147
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,233
Hey. Remember us?

148
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:09,233
We thought maybe if we gave you
some time to think it over.

149
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:13,267
I thought about it.

150
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:17,267
Well, this will be our little
secret. Our lips are

151
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:21,300
so sealed.

152
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Brittany was a centerfold last
May, did you see her?

153
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Um, not everything, there was
this

154
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,333
staple.
So what will it be cowboy, the staple

155
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:37,333
the creases, or the living,
breathing

156
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,367
real me?
Shit! Heather?

157
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:45,367
Heather!

158
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,400
Honey
"I'm only in it for the money"

159
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Hah!
It was them, okay? I wasn't doing anythi

160
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I actually came by to apologize.

161
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,433
You know, I wanted to be a good
girlfriend and

162
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:05,433
support you.
The club was closed down.

163
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:09,467
Okay, I don't even work here
anymore.

164
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:13,467
Don't even bother coming home.
Your stuff will be on the porch.

165
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:33,533
How do you explain to a women
that you're trying to build a future

166
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:37,533
for the both of you, and it can't always
You must accept that

167
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,567
there are people like those
fire-fuckers, huh?

168
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:45,567
Who are not good to be having,
no matter how good your meaning.

169
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:49,600
My girlfriend, she broke up
with me.

170
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
You come into this world alone
as you leave it.

171
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,633
To think of oneself before
others is not a crime.

172
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:13,667
I say fuck everyone.

173
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:17,667
Tomorrow morning here, you will
help me.

174
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,700
But you're closed.

175
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Those fuckers. They can close
my club, but

176
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,700
they can't close me.

177
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,700
You now work full-time for me.

178
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,733
[radio static]

179
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:53,767
*

180
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,833
Come on!

181
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,867
Hey, you work here?

182
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,867
Who wants to know?
Yeah, you don't, do you?

183
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:21,900
No, but, if the chicks think so, I do al

184
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,900
I bet you'd do a lot better if you worke

185
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,933
winning the lottery.
I know. Hey, Nick, Nick Denoia. I used t

186
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:33,933
West Side Story original cast.
Spencer. Wow, awesome, dude.

187
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,933
On Broadway.
Of course. I'm a choreographer now, and

188
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:41,967
I'm toying with the idea of
starting my own male dance club.

189
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:50,067
If you need a dancer, I'm
totally tight.

190
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:54,067
Sure, I'll keep you in mind.

191
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:58,067
Hey, can I help you guys?
Yeah, I'm looking for Steven Banerjee, I

192
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:02,067
Nick Denoia.
We're closed.
I got a call from Mr.

193
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:06,067
Banerjee, he told me to come in
for a meeting, he said he's looking for

194
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,100
Sorry man, the city shut us down.
No way! What for?

195
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Overcrowding.
Oh see, I know a way around that. You ju

196
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,133
two shows a night and make them
each half as long as the one you were do

197
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:22,133
will notice. And that's how you're going

198
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:26,133
Can I just come up? Look my
name's Nick. I'm a

199
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:30,167
professional choreographer. I
had a lot of my shows staged off Broadwa

200
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:34,167
in television. I really think I
can help you guys.

201
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:38,200
Now, anybody can have hot guys
prancing around, but

202
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,233
if you do bigger, synchronized
dance numbers. I mean with costumes, pro

203
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:46,233
lighting, you know, actual real
dancers, I mean,

204
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:50,233
I come from the theatre. I
really think that I could make this show

205
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:54,267
I think it could be really big.

206
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:58,300
And I mean, on Broadway bog.

207
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,300
Women are the divine creator,
the lifeblood that keeps the world spinn

208
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,300
a way to express what a woman
wants. Not what a man thinks a woman wan

209
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,333
and express it sexually,
theatrically, there will be no stopping

210
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,333
Steve, come on, you've got
something really beautiful here. You don

211
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,367
all away. Now, I think you need
me.

212
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:22,400
Um, if you don't mind, I've
been running some numbers, and

213
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
If you pay Nick with half the
take from the second show and

214
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
then you raise the cover to
like twenty bucks a head,

215
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,433
you're looking at an extra
twenty seven grand a week. Not to mentio

216
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:42,467
And you file an injunction. I
mean, you've got magic in these walls.

217
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:46,500
Come on, Steve. The city can't
stop you, nobody can stop you.

218
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,500
No, Chad here, he had a really
good idea

219
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,500
You could also sell merchandise.

220
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,533
The t-shirts up front, they gather dust.

221
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:02,533
pictures? Well, if you put a
photo of one us on a t-shirt, they'll

222
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:06,567
buy it. I mean, you slap a
photo on anything, it'll sell. You

223
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:10,567
could make Chippendales better and more

224
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,567
A reincarnation.
Do you believe in reincarnation?

225
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:18,600
Of course.
So do I. And I definitely believe in

226
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
second chances.
Don't let this cash cow die Steve. Come

227
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Put up a fight.

228
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:34,633
Why do I sit here and wait?

229
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:38,667
*

230
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:46,700
1, 2, a 1, 2, 3, and kick!
Kick, arm around, arm around

231
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,700
cherry picker, cherry picker,
dry hump, dry hump

232
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,733
slap your ass, and pose!
Heather please, it's Chad. Pick up the

233
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:58,733
phone. Honey, why won't you
talk to me, please pick up the

234
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:02,767
phone?
Ladies and ladies!

235
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:06,767
It's the new Chippendales Dance
Revue.

236
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:10,767
Welcome to paradise!

237
00:20:18,800 --> 00:21:51,067
*

238
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Which one of you ladies would
like a special delivery?

239
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,133
That's right, show us the money!

240
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:09,733
Who wants to unwrap his package?

241
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:37,833
*

242
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,867
My wife, she makes me samosa

243
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:49,867
for my stomach straight to my heart.
What's the occasion?

244
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:53,867
Today we celebrate the Diwali.
What's a Delali?

245
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:57,900
Diwali. It's a festival of
lights.

246
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,900
It's where we have a feast for
Lakshmi, she is the goddess of Prosperit

247
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,933
Cool. Well, happy Diwali.

248
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:09,933
The prosperity is also for you.
The ladies, they like you.

249
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:13,967
Thank you.

250
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:17,967
It could be better. So I have
got promotion

251
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:22,067
up my arm for you.
Promotion, really? To what?

252
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:26,067
To dance. Oh, I could never
dance. I could never strip, Steve. I'm n

253
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:30,067
like that. But you know, if you
need help with anything else, especially

254
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:34,067
you-
Think about the dance, okay? Until then,

255
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:38,067
I make you face of
Chippendales? Huh? You will be the boy

256
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:42,067
for the poster. You will be made famous.

257
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:46,067
You know, I'd rather be
assistant manager.

258
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:50,100
If you're good to me, I will

259
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,100
be good to you. It's that
simple.

260
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,133
There?
There.
There!

261
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:18,200
Are you like celibate or what?

262
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,200
No. It's just that I-
Well, are you like a fag or something?pp

263
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,233
Ooh! I didn't think so!

264
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,300
A more mature, dare I say
respectable Chippendales is the talk of

265
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Thanks to director and producer
Nick Denoia, this popular strip club

266
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,333
has become the number one night
spot in LA. If imitation

267
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,333
is the sincerest form of
flattery, Nick Denoia should be very fla

268
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:58,367
The Green Tomato Disco in
Marina Del Ray is cashing in

269
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:02,367
on the growing craze and
starting their very own male dance night

270
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:06,400
Thanks to me, Chippendales is
the number one night spot.

271
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Not that shit bastard Denoia.

272
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,400
What'll it take to make you
happy?

273
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,433
To have no one steal what is
mine. First that

274
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:22,467
shit bastard Nick, and now the
Green Tomato Disco.

275
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:26,467
I started the dancing men.

276
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:30,500
I will sue the Green Tomato
Disco and

277
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,500
the dancing one all the way to
the Supreme Court.

278
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,500
They're not doing anything
illegal.

279
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,533
Men have been dancing around in
their underpants since, well before

280
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:46,533
Jesus. Hell, before Buddha.

281
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:50,567
Then you must make them stop.

282
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:54,567
You pay, I'll play.

283
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,600
My dad and I are way tight.
Like, tag team tight. So you and your da

284
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,633
At the same time?
Let me put it to you this way. My dad ow

285
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:10,633
He's not selfish. I'm not
saying everytime, I'm saying it's

286
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:14,667
been done.
Yeah, well my dad and I did a lot of thi

287
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:19,100
hiking, fishing, catch, but we never...
And Reagan says a family isn't what it u

288
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,100
My dad doesn't believe how much
action I'm getting down here, so

289
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,100
I'm going to prove it to him.

290
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,133
I'm starving.
What do you want to have tonight?
Not want to have. Have to have.

291
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:35,133
Well I've got the urge to
splurge on Italian.

292
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:39,133
You know what I can't just get
enough of?

293
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:43,167
Casting agents. What about you,
Chad?

294
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:47,167
Well, I'm going to have a little bit of

295
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:51,200
Hey, right on.

296
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:07,233
So, the building went up, lots
of flames?

297
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:11,267
Hey, do you have to do that
shit in front of me?

298
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:15,267
Oh, I'm too old for this.

299
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:19,267
*

300
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:23,267
Do you have agent?
Not yet.

301
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:27,300
Have you studied?
Yeah, I'm learning to be a star.

302
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,333
Oh, bellisima!

303
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:35,333
That's killer.

304
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:39,367
If you ever want to screw
again, give me a call.

305
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:43,400
Name?
Jenny Lee

306
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Chad.

307
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:59,433
Heather. Wow.

308
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:03,467
What are you doing here?
Saying hi.

309
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:07,467
I didn't think I'd ever see you
again.

310
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:11,467
I called, I wrote a bunch of
messages.

311
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:15,500
I know. Wow.

312
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,533
Is this your car?
Yeah, you like it?

313
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:23,533
It's awesome!
It's fast.
I bet.

314
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:27,567
Looks fast.

315
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:31,567
So, I see your face everywhere.
I didn't really

316
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:35,600
think you would stay this long.
Well, I'm making great money.

317
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,600
And I'm investing it all in the
market. Pretty soon I'm going to be the

318
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,633
How about you?
I'm okay.

319
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:47,633
Well, not so okay.
Why? What's wrong?

320
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:55,633
I miss you, Chad. And well,

321
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:59,633
I was hoping that maybe we
could hang out? Like old times?

322
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:03,667
Chad?
Huh?

323
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:07,667
I miss you.

324
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:11,667
What I'm doing right now, it
just feels

325
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,700
right. You know?

326
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,733
It's hard to explain.

327
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:23,733
I don't know how long I can
wait.

328
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:31,767
Tonight, Jenny Lee was first,
and you were second and third and then

329
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:35,800
Rose was next.
Nick's gay, right?
Now that we had you, he's the
only

330
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,833
one left.
And he won't give us the time of day.
Because you're having sex with

331
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:43,833
every worker here. Say cheese.
Grody

332
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:47,833
If you count the valet and the
bar backs, absolutely not.

333
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:51,867
Are we ready boys?

334
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:55,867
Come on, nap time's over, get
up. First position.

335
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:59,867
Please. And, a 5,

336
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:03,900
6, a 5, 6, 7, 8!

337
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,900
These handymen can!

338
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,933
One lick of their peppermint
sticks

339
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:15,967
will give sweet tingly delight.

340
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:19,967
Stop, stop, stop. What the fuck
is that?

341
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:24,000
Who writes this shit?

342
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It sucks.
No, it doesn't suck.

343
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,033
The delivery sucks.

344
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:36,033
Got a little...

345
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:40,067
Temper.

346
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:44,067
All right. Let's go again,
please.

347
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:48,067
a 5, 6, a 5, 6, 7, 8!

348
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,200
Royce, you're late.

349
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,133
You're behind Royce, come on,
Pick it up Royce, come on.

350
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:08,167
Wake the fuck up. Stop, stop,
stop.

351
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:12,200
Good morning! Anybody

352
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,200
home? Jesus Christ you guys,
you know it's like, you're supposed to b

353
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,233
God's gift to womankind. The
most spectacular men to ever walk the Ea

354
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:24,233
I'm watching a bowl. Now Royce,
you

355
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:28,267
when you do that turn, boom!
You gotta kick into it. Boom!

356
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:32,267
Do you understand that? I'm
taking this show to Broadway.

357
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:36,300
Okay? Now if you don't care
about Broadway, then you can hit the hig

358
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,300
What?
You see that? Up there?

359
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,300
That's a door. Use it.

360
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:52,333
This ballet shit is for fags
anyways.

361
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:04,400
Gentlemen, look. You give me
what I want,

362
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,400
and I'm a sweetheart. Now, the
only time you have trouble with me is wh

363
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,400
make me break your balls.
Sorry. Backs.

364
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,433
Now, you, Spencer. I know
you've got the moves, baby, but

365
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:20,467
I'm just not feeling the
grooves, you know what I mean? I mean, y

366
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:24,500
sensuality. Now, I want to try
an exercise with you. I want

367
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,500
you to pretend that I'm a woman.

368
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Just, all right. Just talk to
me like I'm a woman.

369
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,533
Hey, baby.
Sexier, closer.

370
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:40,533
You're way hot.
Mm yeah, what am I, chopped liver?

371
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:44,567
What the?

372
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:48,567
You touch me again, I'll kill
you.

373
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:04,633
You know, before I created
"Welcome to Paradise" I was

374
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:08,633
living in my car.
Why?

375
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:12,633
Because I risked it all.

376
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:16,667
I put everything I owned into
an original Nick Denoia show.

377
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:20,667
And we were going to Broadway,
too.

378
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:24,667
The producer, she, she stole
the financing.

379
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:28,700
I reached for the stars and I
fell. Hard.

380
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,700
And I'll do it all again.

381
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Nobody can stop me.

382
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,733
None of you

383
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:44,733
can stop me.

384
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:48,767
Steve said you can't fire him.

385
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:52,767
So why doesn't he just tell me
that himself?

386
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:56,800
Bastard! He might've been the
first to have men strip, but I'm going

387
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,867
to make it last. I've got big
plans and they don't include him.

388
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:04,833
Or those idiotic apes he calls
dancers.

389
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:08,833
These amateurs may have been
fun for your little backwards burlesque

390
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:12,867
but they have no right in a
professional show!

391
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:16,867
You make me keep them and I
will quit!

392
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:20,900
I won't stop you.
No? Okay, fine. I'll just go to my good

393
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Bob Marcucci? You might know
him as the famous Idol maker. He's very

394
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,900
in investing in my male dance
revue. I'll just take my show to him.

395
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,933
You? You own nothing!
No, I talked to my lawyer.

396
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:36,933
She told me that you own the
club. Your name, your ideas.

397
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:40,967
And I own the show. My name, my
ideas.

398
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:44,967
You know.

399
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:49,067
Steve. If you don't pay me my
take from the door,

400
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:53,067
I mean, What am I supposed to
do?

401
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:05,067
Gee you know, I really

402
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:09,067
I'd really have to hate to
tattle to the IRS. You know, just about

403
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:13,067
and the payoffs.

404
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:17,067
Oh, and the watering down the
booze.

405
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:25,067
I'm not going anywhere
empty-handed.

406
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,100
You know, much of my life has
been spent

407
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,133
on the road doing touring
theatre. Hello Dolly,

408
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:41,133
Cabaret. We would travel from
town to town and we'd

409
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:45,133
bring a little bit of culture
to those without any.

410
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:49,167
I can do the same thing with
Chippendales. With my own

411
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:53,167
cast. A touring show. That
would be mine.

412
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:57,167
Yeah, take me off the payroll.

413
00:35:57,167 --> 00:36:01,267
Do it, you'll save some money.
Just let me go.

414
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:05,200
You will still own all the
merchandise, and I'll help you promote i

415
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Steve, come on! It's free
publicity.

416
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Steve.

417
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,233
This is our ship.

418
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:21,233
Now, look.

419
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:25,267
When I first came to you, you

420
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:29,300
trusted me. And you're a hell
of a lot better off because of it.

421
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,300
Now, I could open my own club
across town.

422
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,300
be your competition. Or, I

423
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,333
can go on the road.

424
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,333
For you. You choose.

425
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:53,367
If I sign. No more

426
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:57,400
of you in my face.
This bird has wings. He'll

427
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,400
fly if you set him free.

428
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,433
Here.

429
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:17,467
We're really going places with
this one, Steven.

430
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:25,500
You guys hear the good news?
Your IBM stocks live again.

431
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Not all of us have extra money
to invest, Chad. Some of us have familie

432
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,533
support.
No, good news for you guys. Nick's histo

433
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:37,533
He's out of here. He's starting his own

434
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:41,567
Yeah, shit.
I think we should celebrate. Donny invit

435
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:45,600
you guys should come along.
Booze, blow, jet skis, surfing.

436
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,600
I'm in.
I'm in. Pussy?
BYOP.

437
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,633
I'm in.
Yeah!

438
00:37:53,633 --> 00:38:37,767
*

439
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,800
The Green Tomato still has the
men. Why?

440
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,800
It's all in the message. You
got the message across that you mean bus

441
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,833
They still have the men dancing.

442
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:57,833
You scared them.
I will not have competition.

443
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:09,900
Call in a threat of a bomb
every night until they cancel

444
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,900
the show for good.

445
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,967
It's the least I could do.

446
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:34,067
I've had soul food, Vietnamese
food, Thai, Korean, Filipino. I've had t

447
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:38,067
Pacific rim. Swedish,
Icelandic, Egyptian, Morrocan. I've

448
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:42,067
even fucked a bodacious babe from Niga.
Is there any nationality you haven't had

449
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:46,067
The most killer lay. To the
max. Hardest game to bag. Is

450
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:50,100
Indian. Full on dot-headed
Indian chicks.

451
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,100
It's called an Indie. It means
the women are married or spiritually enl

452
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,100
No doubt. They don't care
what's in a white man's pants. That dot?

453
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,133
It's like a mondo-target. Taunting me.pp

454
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:06,133
wife.
Hey, she's not even an Indian.

455
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:10,133
Who made you Steve's bitch?
Don't come down on him. Steve's a decent

456
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:14,167
To you.
Dude makes more enemies than money.
Made sure that you didn't get
fired, hmm?

457
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:18,167
What about medical deformities?
I've had a midget.

458
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:22,167
She dressed like a school girl.
Youngest?
Fifth grader.

459
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:26,200
Sick.
I was in fourth! She wanted it.

460
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,233
Here you go. I thought you and
I were going up to

461
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:34,233
the main house, Peyton.
Sure thing, honey.

462
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:38,267
Duty calls.

463
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:42,267
That leaves all of us. You up
for it, sugar?

464
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:46,300
Whatever.
Hey, wait a minute.
What?

465
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,333
Who's first?
Rock, Scissors, Paper?

466
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:54,333
All right. Go for it.

467
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:10,367
*

468
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:14,367
You speak the language of no?

469
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:18,400
Thrust! Ass, ass.

470
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Hand, hand.

471
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,433
I'm the coach of the world's
locker room.

472
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:30,467
So look out world, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

473
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:34,467
The suspect is driving a red
Camaro and heading west on Fountain, use

474
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:38,467
The guy's armed and dangerous.

475
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:42,500
Intruder virus!

476
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,533
Was the laugh too much?

477
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:50,533
Women are entering the
workforce in record numbers. Divorce

478
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:54,567
rates are higher than ever. For
the first time in history, women have th

479
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,567
freedom and money to express
themselves. Is this what the women's mov

480
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:02,600
has brought us? Just what is
going

481
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,600
on behind closed doors? We went
to the Chippendales nightclub to find ou

482
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,600
first hand.
Oh my god, I went to this Bachelorette p

483
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,633
bride and her mother did every
single dancer in the club. I mean,

484
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:18,633
there was a line out the bathroom door!
It's true.

485
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:22,667
This isn't the Donkey show
anymore. What I've created is the most i

486
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:26,700
in the world for women. Women
have never had anything like this. We me

487
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,700
permitted them to have it. And dammit, i
Cocksucker.

488
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,733
He will not beat me.
They perform

489
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:38,733
in convention centers. Hoten
ballrooms, arenas.

490
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:42,767
Places that hold one or two
women a night, which really kind of suck

491
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:46,800
You think I do not know?
Sorry.

492
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,800
You wanted to see me, now see
me.

493
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,833
Yeah.

494
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:58,833
You know how you keep

495
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:02,867
promising me

496
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:06,867
Steve, I think it's time you
follow through, you know, I'm really rea

497
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:10,900
run this club.
You think you can run my club?

498
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,933
Yeah, I have me MBA.
Well I have a nothing, I do quite well.

499
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:18,933
I know. It's just that

500
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:22,933
I'm, I'm not just one of the
guys okay, I'm not like them.

501
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,967
I can do your books, I can do your long-
I have a

502
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:30,967
long-term plan. To build a Chippendales

503
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:34,967
what I was thinking.
If you want to help,

504
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:39,067
do you know what the best thing
you can do?

505
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:43,067
What?
Dance.

506
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:47,067
The ladies, they love you, okay?

507
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:51,067
If I put your name on the
marquee, we could make so much money.

508
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:55,067
I'm not a good dancer.
Who has to dance? Look pretty and drop y

509
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:59,100
Hey. If you're so smart, it
will be so easy.

510
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Steve, please, I
Ah, business is business.

511
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,133
You know that I'm being sued by
the gays who are not allowed to see the

512
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:11,133
And the city is after me with
zoning laws this and zoning laws that.

513
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:15,133
These lawsuits are costing me
time and my money.

514
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:19,200
If the gays win the
discrimination, they will take away

515
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,200
my liquor license. I am
fighting to the death! I need the money

516
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,200
for the lawyers.
It's not that I don't want to help you,

517
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,233
Would you rather quit?
Quit? No.
Good.

518
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:35,233
Then you can help me make money.

519
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:39,233
Ah, ah, ah, no sad face.

520
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:43,267
You consider dancing. I will
consider

521
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:47,267
making you my manager. Okay?

522
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:51,300
Nobody's forcing us to work
there, either, believe me, we want to.

523
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,300
There's no place in the world I
can make this much money or have this

524
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,300
much fun. You know, I couldn't
imagine working anywhere else.

525
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:07,367
Clayton, you are so good for me.

526
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:11,367
Mm, you make me feel so young
again.

527
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:15,367
That's my job.

528
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:51,500
Dottie?

529
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:15,600
Death by cunnilingus. I'm
afraid I'm going to

530
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,600
have to take you in to ask you
some questions.

531
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,600
I mean, the guys down at the
station could really use the advice.

532
00:46:27,633 --> 00:46:31,667
Look, sorry,

533
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:35,700
kid. It's a bad joke. Why don't
you take a seat.

534
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Is there anything we can do?

535
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,700
thirty one days in February?

536
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,733
twenty eight in August?

537
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:51,767
That I now know. It will cost me

538
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,800
half a million dollars to have
them printed correctly.

539
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,800
You didn't hire someone to proofread?
I had a deadline with the printer! Do yo

540
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,800
how much extra it is to rush the job?
You lose more

541
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,833
money trying to save it.
I'll get a loan, and then I'll open up

542
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,867
Chippendales across the
country, and I will make so much money i

543
00:47:11,867 --> 00:47:15,867
How do you expect to get a loan
with the books you keep?

544
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:19,900
If you check your financials,
you haven't turned a profit since you op

545
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:27,933
What has worked for me in the
past doesn't help me now.

546
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:31,967
Why the fuck did you give Nick
Denoia the touring rights?

547
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:35,967
Whoever heard of traveling
dancing strip show, huh?

548
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:39,967
I just wanted him gone!
Yeah, he's gone all right. Gone to make

549
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:44,067
I'll get the rights back.

550
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:48,067
They're the most profitable

551
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:52,067
assets of the company. How are
you going to do that?

552
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:56,067
Everybody has a price.

553
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,067
Oh, one more thing.

554
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:08,067
Can you sign this?

555
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,100
Hey.

556
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,133
Wanna stay over tonight? I can
make you some breakfast in the morning.

557
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:28,133
You were fantastic.
Well, can I call you?

558
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:40,200
That was awesome! Can I take
your picture?

559
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,200
Oh! Smile, honey.

560
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,300
Hey!

561
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,333
Dottie passed away.
No way! Bummer, man.

562
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:24,367
Come in. Loss of income's gotta
suck.

563
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:29,567
What?
Yeah, she kept you in major style, man.
It wasn't like that!

564
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:33,567
Woah! What the hell's going on
here?

565
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:37,600
Dottie died.

566
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,600
I didn't need her for that.

567
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,633
You loved her?

568
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:49,633
Yeah. Strange.

569
00:49:53,667 --> 00:50:00,567
*

570
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:04,567
Dottie was kind of like my mom.

571
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:08,567
Took better care of me than I took care

572
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:12,600
She was thirteen when she had
me. My dad said she was a way wild. Coup

573
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,600
she split. Haven't seen her since.
My mom was like 47

574
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,633
when she had me. Everybody thinks she's 
Have you ever seen her naked?

575
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:24,633
Please.
Come on, we've all screwed our moms.
Not me.

576
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:28,667
Yeah, you.
Every guy has. When you're born.

577
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:32,700
There's contact.
No doubt Chad, you loved it.
What's up with you, Royce,

578
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,700
how do you think this shit up?
Lately? My mind, I just, I can't help it

579
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,733
I'm telling you guys not me, all right?

580
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:44,733
Fuck you.

581
00:50:44,733 --> 00:50:48,767
Spencer?
Trying to catch a squirrel?

582
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:52,767
What?
Your nuts are hanging out.
Those aren't my nuts.

583
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:56,767
That's just my leg.
Mr. Grad school. Take a look.

584
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:00,867
You're smart. Those Spencer's nuts or hi

585
00:51:00,867 --> 00:51:04,800
I didn't get in, sorry.
You wanna see my nuts?
No.

586
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,833
These are my nuts.

587
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:12,867
You're all bald. Like a couple of cockta

588
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:16,867
Yeah, so?
How the fuck do you shave your nutsack?

589
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:20,900
With a razor.
Oh!
You've gotta get them cold
first, so they

590
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,867
shrink up nice and compact. Then you lat

591
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:28,900
You've gotta work quick with a
steady hand. And never use

592
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,933
a straight.
I give, it was your leg.

593
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:36,933
Well I think you'd wanna
stretch the skin out, all straight and s

594
00:51:36,933 --> 00:51:40,933
when they compact it's like a
beehive. I mean, how the hell can you sh

595
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:45,067
No two nuts are made the same.
Well, what about your asshole?

596
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:48,967
That's easy. The trick is
balancing the mirror in the sink so you

597
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:53,067
stand over it just right.
Enough!
Thanks, now we're going to have
nightmares.

598
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:05,067
Hey.
What?

599
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:13,067
Nothing.

600
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:17,067
Yeah. I hear you.

601
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:25,100
*

602
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:34,367
Why haven't I seen you in a
while?

603
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:38,400
I've just put out so much for
you. What have I gotten in return? Nothi

604
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,400
not a lead on an agent. God
forbid you actually cast me.

605
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,433
Now that you mention it. I am
working on something that I think you'd

606
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:50,467
in. Have you heard of Miami
Vice?

607
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:54,467
I'd love to bring you in to

608
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:58,500
read for a recurring role.
Really?

609
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,500
You'd give me the shot?
Yours wouldn't be the first career I've

610
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,500
You're not saying that just to
get in my pants?

611
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,533
You are so talented. Now, why
would I do that?

612
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:14,533
Your place or mine?

613
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:22,567
Excuse me. I understand you have

614
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:26,600
sex with the customers.
Who wants to know?
Do you charge?

615
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,600
For you, baby? Nothing.

616
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,600
Woah, okay, woah!

617
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,633
All right. Okay, big guy. I was
just asking.

618
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:42,633
All right big guy, that's
enough.

619
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:50,667
Asshole. I'm with the

620
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:54,667
Vice Bureau.
Role playing's extra.

621
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:58,700
Get off of me!

622
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,733
Now is your turn to help me.
How?
We're short a dancer.

623
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:14,733
So, tonight's your lucky night.

624
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:18,733
I don't think so, Steve. I am
not filling in for Royce.

625
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:22,767
What's good for the company
makes me happy and when I am happy, I

626
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:26,767
consider you as manager.
I can't.

627
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:30,800
You will if you like your job.
So you're going

628
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,833
to fire me if I don't dance.

629
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:38,833
Since you are like one of my
own, I will give you until this weekend

630
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:42,833
a dance so you will not feel
such nerves.

631
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:46,867
Ladies!

632
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:50,867
Are you feeling good? Are you
feeling groovy?

633
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:54,900
We're going to kick tonight's
show off with a bang!

634
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,900
Independent state's style.
Let's hear it for

635
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,933
Spencer!

636
00:55:06,933 --> 00:56:23,167
*

637
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Fuck Steve. I don't need to
work.

638
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,233
Live off my stocks. My
investments have been great.

639
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:43,233
That's funny.

640
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,267
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?

641
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:51,300
What do you mean I lost everything?
The market crashed.

642
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,300
They called in your margin. You
don't have the money to cover it.

643
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,333
Wait, so you're saying I'm
broke?

644
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:03,333
It's all gone, all of it?
Unfortunately. But we'll figure

645
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:07,333
something out. Listen, can we
talk about this in the morning?

646
00:57:27,433 --> 00:57:31,433
Hi, you've reached Heather.
Leave me a message and I'll

647
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:35,467
call you back. Bye.

648
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:47,500
*

649
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,500
You own nothing!

650
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,533
You little bitch!

651
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:59,533
I made you. Now how's the
weather in

652
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:03,567
Philly? Oh, I heard you had a
packed house in DC. What'd you do, fly m

653
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:07,567
Yeah well, I counter back with
you should pay me to license the Chippen

654
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,600
because I made it big. Bigger
than you

655
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,633
could've ever even imagined.

656
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:19,633
I have a contract drawn up.

657
00:58:19,633 --> 00:58:23,667
Oh, yeah. I see. Well, I got a
contract, too. Oops!

658
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:27,700
A napkin.

659
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,700
You have a napkin.
Yeah, but oh, look, it's got our signatu

660
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,700
on it. It'll hold up in court.

661
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,700
Name your price.

662
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,733
I'll buy all the rights back.
Yeah, well, you can't

663
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:47,767
sell a dream. Look, I've got a
Chippendale show going up on Broadway

664
00:58:47,767 --> 00:58:51,767
next month. And to quote the
immortal Karen Carpenter,

665
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:55,800
"I've only just begun."

666
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,800
You're fucking with the wrong
genius, dollface.

667
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:15,867
Why don't you scare the shit out of him?

668
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:19,900
This fucker is over. I asked
for business

669
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,933
and respect settle for good.

670
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:27,933
How much?
Oh, fuck Steve.

671
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:31,967
What's your price?

672
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:35,967
I couldn't get it done for less
than a hundred thou.

673
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:40,067
What goes around does come
around.

674
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:44,067
We're talking about

675
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:48,067
a fucking human life.
Here's half.

676
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:56,067
How much?
two hundred dollars.

677
00:59:56,067 --> 01:00:00,033
Let's be fucking professional
here. I want to know I'm

678
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:04,067
hiring a professional. Make me
want to hire you for this

679
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:08,100
job. For starters, ask me for
more.

680
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:12,100
four hundred dollars?

681
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,133
Christ, Hernando! How much do
you think a human life is worth?

682
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:20,133
A thousand dollars.
There we go, now we're talking.

683
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:24,167
I pay you a thousand dollars.
Half when we touch ground in New York,

684
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:28,200
half immediately after.
Comprende?

685
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,200
You're going to dance?
Yeah.

686
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,233
Good cop, bad cop routine.

687
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:44,267
They'll eat it up. Hey, I
finally got a date with an Indie girl.

688
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:48,267
Good for you.
I mean, she's not that hot, but she's In

689
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:52,300
And that counts for something.

690
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,300
I take it you didn't get the
role?

691
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,367
I went there. But it wasn't
there. The address she gave me

692
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:04,333
was a factory. They chrome
bumpers and shower rods and shit, but it

693
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:08,333
the right address. So I make
some calls. I find out the bitch isn't e

694
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:12,333
a casting agent. She sells
carpet.

695
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:16,367
I feel like I've been spinning
in circles. I'm going nowhere!

696
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:20,367
I'm making some changes. From
now on, I'm going to make it on my own,

697
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:24,400
any fucking help from anything
or anybody!

698
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Royce loses it and now you?
Stay away, it might be

699
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,400
contagious.
How's he doing?

700
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,433
His wife left him. He could get up to a 
I think he should plea pussy fever.

701
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:40,467
What?
I mean, his judgement was all clouded, y

702
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:44,467
He couldn't tell right from wrong. I'll

703
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:48,500
Cause I know how sex can drive
a man mad.

704
01:01:56,533 --> 01:02:00,600
Before this bride to be walks
down the aisle,

705
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,567
we're going to take her for a
walk on the wild side!

706
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:08,600
How many Bachelorettes do we
get tonight?

707
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,600
Four, including this one.
I think it's about time we

708
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,633
tell her where her friends have
brought her for the last and most ultima

709
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:20,633
party of her single life!

710
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:24,667
Oh yeah, baby. You know it.
You're at Chippendales!

711
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:32,667
Where your every fantasy will
come true!

712
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,700
Heather.

713
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,733
Chad.

714
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:49,067
Wow. I've been thinking about you.
I've been thinking about you, too

715
01:02:49,067 --> 01:02:53,067
You have?
Well duh, of course. I always do.

716
01:02:53,067 --> 01:02:57,067
I tried calling you, and,
This isn't exactly how I

717
01:02:57,067 --> 01:03:01,167
wanted you to find out.

718
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:05,133
I've been thinking about you.
You said that already.

719
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:09,133
Yeah.
He owns a chain of sunglass stores.

720
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:13,133
You'd like him. He's nice. Wow.

721
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:17,167
You look awesome. I'm really
proud of you.

722
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:21,200
Really?
Well, we've come a long way, huh?

723
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,200
King and Queen of Winter Court.

724
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,233
You always had it so figured
out. Wow, how is it being manager

725
01:03:29,233 --> 01:03:33,233
of this place?
What?
Well, you're in charge of this
place, right?

726
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:37,267
Running the business.
Yeah.

727
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:41,267
At least you're not one of the
cheesy dancers.

728
01:03:41,267 --> 01:03:45,300
Yeah. You did it.

729
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,300
I did it. Well, I'd better run.
My party.

730
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,333
Someone's not going to live
this one down.

731
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:57,367
Did someone call 911?

732
01:03:57,367 --> 01:04:01,433
If there's an emergency in your
pants have I got the cop for you!

733
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:05,367
You've seen him on calendars
and on television and tonight you're goi

734
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:09,400
live, and alive for the first
time in the living flesh,

735
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,433
Hey Chad, you're up man.
Where's your costume?

736
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:17,400
Let's give it up for the
officer, the gentlemen,

737
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,433
the face of Chippendales!

738
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:25,467
Chad!

739
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:37,500
Chad!

740
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Chad

741
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,500
Chad, the man on the calendar,

742
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,533
Chad.

743
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:53,533
Have you seen Chad?

744
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:57,567
Hey, Chad, where are you? The stage is e
I'm done.

745
01:04:57,567 --> 01:05:01,567
Hey! Where are you?

746
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:11,600
*

747
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:27,667
Fuck!

748
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:31,700
I just wanted to see the show!
How else

749
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,700
was a guy supposed to get in?
I don't know whether to kick your ass

750
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:39,733
or let you finish.

751
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:43,767
Forget you ever knew.

752
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:47,767
You know what?

753
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:11,833
Oh man.

754
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:15,833
Oh yeah.

755
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:27,867
I don't care if it's a
mob-owned club. I don't even care if it'

756
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:31,900
owned club. We can't do the gig!

757
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,933
Is this Chippendales?
The auditions aren't until next week.

758
01:06:35,933 --> 01:06:39,933
Are you Nick Denoia?
It depends on who's asking.

759
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:53,933
It is a sad day for the
Chippendales family as touring

760
01:06:53,933 --> 01:06:57,967
show producer Nick Denoia was
shot and killed in his midtown Manhattan

761
01:06:57,967 --> 01:07:01,967
morning.
Our thoughts are with is family right no

762
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:06,067
There will be no replacement for Nick De
The dancers are in seclusion

763
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:10,067
but their spokesperson says
that tonight's show will go on, because

764
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:14,067
way Nick would've wanted it.

765
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:30,100
I've arranged for my tour to
begin next

766
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:34,133
week. 
I called Nick's lawyer. It seems

767
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:38,133
you just don't get the touring rights ba
Fuck, what?

768
01:07:38,133 --> 01:07:42,167
When Nick died, everything he
owned passed on

769
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:46,200
to his next of kin. You have to pay for 
This is law?

770
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,200
When you die in this country,
everything you own transfers on to your

771
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,200
next of kin.
Why the fuck did not anyone tell me this

772
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,233
You hired me for security,
Steve. You need legal advice,

773
01:07:58,233 --> 01:08:02,233
hire a lawyer.
What is

774
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:06,267
this deal?
A million and a half, and they won't bud

775
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:10,267
This Nick. He fucks me

776
01:08:10,267 --> 01:08:13,367
even from his grave.

777
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:17,400
I heard Nick cancelled his show
last minute at a mob-owned club. Somethi

778
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:21,400
a mob hit.
I heard the cops in New York are high on

779
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,433
but I vote Steve.
Would Steve do that?

780
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:29,467
Look, whether or not Steve did
it, it's just best that we get the hell

781
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:33,467
What do you mean, out of there?
Hey, I've been thinking about

782
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:37,500
something for a real long time
and have been wanting to to tell you abo

783
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,500
I've decided I want to start my
own male dance revue.

784
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:45,533
You know, complete with
calendar, postcards, videos. The whole

785
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:49,567
nine yards. I want you both to
come work with me.

786
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:53,567
What about Steve?

787
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:57,600
A little competition never hurt anybody,
You're totally serious.

788
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,600
Yeah, I've sunk every dime I've
got into this thing. I even have a show

789
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,633
Now when we get rolling, I
promise you guys I am going to pay you b

790
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:10,367
Steve ever did, okay? I even
got a profit sharing plan set up for you

791
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:14,367
That's cool. I mean, we're the
reason broads

792
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,400
come to the show anyway. Why
should we let somebody else profit from

793
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,433
Exactly?
And what about Royce?
He'll dance with us when he
gets out.

794
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:26,433
And when's that?
He pled guilty to assault.
And got six months.

795
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:30,433
Yeah, but he'll get three for
good behavior.

796
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:34,467
Do you really think we can do this?
Does it hurt to try?

797
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:42,500
What are we waiting for?

798
01:09:42,500 --> 01:10:06,600
*

799
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:14,633
You should've married the
money. You spend more time with it than

800
01:10:14,633 --> 01:10:18,667
You want the money to live like a prince
I would rather have you.

801
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:22,667
Well, you can't have them both.

802
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,733
What?

803
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:54,767
Don't just stand there, say
something.

804
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:58,800
I think I speak for everyone
when I say this really bites, Chad.

805
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,800
I know. I know, you guys.

806
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,800
Let's split. Hey, guys, I'm
going to pay you all for showing up toni

807
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,833
Clayton?

808
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:18,833
Hey dad!

809
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:22,867
The show was cancelled. They
had a bomb threat.

810
01:11:22,867 --> 01:11:26,867
I'm sorry you drove all the way down her

811
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:30,867
I want you to meet.
Yeah?
Yeah. When I seen her at the
World of Nudes, I said to myself

812
01:11:30,867 --> 01:11:34,900
my son's gotta see this piece
of ass. Hold on a second.

813
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:38,900
Hey honey! Come over here. You
won't remember her.

814
01:11:42,933 --> 01:11:46,967
I totally remember her.

815
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:51,067
How could I forget.
You do? You were kinda young. Virginia,

816
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:55,067
Spence, meet your mother.
Baby!

817
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:51,233
Why are you doing this to me?

818
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:55,233
You quit with no explanation.

819
01:12:55,233 --> 01:12:59,267
You don't return my phone calls.

820
01:12:59,267 --> 01:13:03,267
And now you want to steal from me? Huh?
Can't you just leave us alone?

821
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:07,267
You are the face that launch

822
01:13:07,267 --> 01:13:11,267
a thousand and more calendars.
I made you a face to remember.

823
01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:15,300
You don't need us.
I need your bodies.

824
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:19,300
Not your competition. You must
stop.

825
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:23,300
Why? Huh? Why do we have to
stop? We're not breaking any laws.

826
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:31,367
When I come to America, there
was no one to help me.

827
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:35,400
I helped myself. I made my own
rules.

828
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,433
Hey, don't look at me all
crooked eye. I was not the first!

829
01:13:39,433 --> 01:13:43,433
Your Joseph Kennedy, huh? He
made it

830
01:13:43,433 --> 01:13:47,433
He built a fortune off of
little booze.

831
01:13:47,433 --> 01:13:51,467
Tonight's news. President
Ronald Reagan. Breaks the laws

832
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:55,500
of this country to fund his
secret war. To bend the law is the

833
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,500
American way.
What are you saying?

834
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,500
The dancing men are mine, and
mine only. Please.

835
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:08,133
This is not personal. This is
business, Chad.

836
01:14:08,133 --> 01:14:12,167
Was killing Nick business?

837
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:16,167
Or personal?

838
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:24,200
I made you, you stupid dump
fucking

839
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,200
You don't walk out on me! I
will walk out

840
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:32,233
on you!

841
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:36,267
All three of them.

842
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:40,267
That's not just a hit. That's a
massacre.

843
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:44,267
Are you sure it's worth it?
Make it look like an accident.

844
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:48,300
Maybe a drug overdose.

845
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:52,300
I'll have to hire a real
expert.

846
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,333
It's going to cost me half a
fucking mil to pull this one off.

847
01:14:56,333 --> 01:15:00,433
This is not your ordinary hit,
Steve.

848
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:04,367
Sweet mary, shit.

849
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:08,367
Here's half.

850
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:12,400
Shit.

851
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:28,467
Cyanide and syringes. Inject
them into their butts.

852
01:15:28,467 --> 01:15:32,467
Why?
Can't be traced. I stole it from a neigh

853
01:15:32,467 --> 01:15:36,500
in Jersey. I had a gopher
problem.

854
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,500
I know needles. They break.
Their asses are

855
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,533
very strong.
It's just an idea. Cap them, what

856
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:48,533
the shit do I care?
There is twice the risk. I have to

857
01:15:48,533 --> 01:15:52,567
ask you for twice the money.
I want you clean on these

858
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:56,567
hits. I want no problems, got it?
No, no, after New

859
01:15:56,567 --> 01:16:00,633
York, no more monkeys on my
back. After seeing that

860
01:16:00,633 --> 01:16:04,633
hombre's all, boom! It sobers
you up.

861
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:08,600
I'm clean. I am how you say, a
responsible

862
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,633
Oh yeah, send your
responsibility

863
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:16,667
If you promise to save some of
this, I'll give you two thousand now

864
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,300
and two thousand after you pop
them.

865
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,300
Oh, you are the bestest boss

866
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:27,333
I ever had. I am going to buy
my daughter an EasyBake oven

867
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:31,333
and I save the rest, and I am,
how you say,

868
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:35,367
Senor responsibility.
You're shitting me.

869
01:16:35,367 --> 01:16:39,367
I have my little angel's birthday tomorr
By granddaughter's birthday's tomorrow

870
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:43,400
also, I got a fucking EasyBake
oven in the back of the car!

871
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:47,767
Kismet. This was meant to be.

872
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,800
Here.

873
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,833
These three chumps right here.
Mr. June, Mr. August, and for Christmas,

874
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:03,833
Mr. December. After you're
done, you

875
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:07,867
burn this.

876
01:17:07,867 --> 01:17:11,867
You ever wonder how

877
01:17:11,867 --> 01:17:15,900
a lightbulb can bake a goddamn
cake?

878
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,933
No.
I do.

879
01:17:23,967 --> 01:17:52,600
*

880
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:08,700
Who is it?
Delivery.

881
01:18:20,767 --> 01:18:24,767
Sign here.

882
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:32,800
Thanks

883
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,800
Thank you.

884
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:48,900
I lost my passion

885
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,900
for living. I was too high to
notice.

886
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,900
I had lost the woman I

887
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,933
loved. I was too high to

888
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:04,967
mourn. I lost track of my

889
01:19:04,967 --> 01:19:08,967
greatest strength. Me.

890
01:19:08,967 --> 01:19:13,067
Because I was too weak to care.

891
01:19:13,067 --> 01:19:17,067
The past is just a memory.

892
01:19:17,067 --> 01:19:21,067
The future's just a dream. I
only have now.

893
01:19:21,067 --> 01:19:25,067
And now I choose to celebrate
me.

894
01:19:25,067 --> 01:19:29,067
A clean and sober me.

895
01:19:53,133 --> 01:19:57,133
Freeze!

896
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:13,233
Hey. Hi. I'm Lenny Fincklestein.

897
01:20:13,233 --> 01:20:17,233
I loved your honesty up there,
I'm sober eight months myself.

898
01:20:17,233 --> 01:20:21,267
Let me cut to the chase. I work
for United Clients Agency. We represent

899
01:20:21,267 --> 01:20:25,267
picture business. Has anybody
ever told you

900
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:29,267
you've got that star quality
babe. You got it, seriously. Call me.

901
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I'm looking for Chino Glomski.

902
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,033
Yeah. For you.

903
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:47,067
Glomski.

904
01:20:47,067 --> 01:20:51,067
I'm in the clink. Oh Jesus. Sit
tight.

905
01:20:51,067 --> 01:20:55,100
Watch what you say. I'll get
you out.

906
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,100
Was that him?

907
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:03,133
The hit's off.

908
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:07,133
I must be crazy.
Yeah, you said it.
I'll pay the assassin's bill
and some extra

909
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:11,167
cash to keep his lips closed.

910
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:15,200
He does not know who I am, huh?
I've never mentioned you.

911
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:19,200
Are you afraid that he will tell the pol

912
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,233
turn stakes, set me up. I'm too
smart for that.

913
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:27,233
I'm watching my back.

914
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:35,267
What, what'd I say?

915
01:21:39,267 --> 01:21:43,300
Of course I'm not wired. I
haven't been

916
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,300
arrested! I'm here, ain't I?

917
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:55,367
The only way to tie him

918
01:21:55,367 --> 01:21:59,400
to you is through me. Yeah, so?
I

919
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,400
ain't going to rat you out.
Steve.

920
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,400
We go way back.
I'll have airplane tickets delivered to

921
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:11,400
We leave the country tomorrow.

922
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,433
Steve wants us dead?

923
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:19,467
Never had a hit taken out on my before.
It's kind of cool.

924
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:23,500
In character?
All right, listen. You have nothing

925
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,467
to worry about. We have the
warrant. All we need is a warm body, all

926
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:47,600
I don't want any listening in.

927
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,600
The cops have no jurisdiction
in Paris. You made it here, right?

928
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,633
We're free. We're out of the
woods.

929
01:22:55,633 --> 01:22:59,633
Come on, let's celebrate. Have
a drink.

930
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:03,667
Maybe then

931
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:07,700
you are wearing recording
device?

932
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:11,733
Take off your clothes.
You're serious.
Or I'll leave

933
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:15,767
right now.
All right, relax.
It's just me, your old friend

934
01:23:15,767 --> 01:23:19,767
Glomski.

935
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:23,767
Christ. You really are

936
01:23:23,767 --> 01:23:27,767
serious.

937
01:23:27,767 --> 01:23:32,167
You ever strip for anyone. This
ain't easy.

938
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:36,200
Do you mind?

939
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,233
I would never bring shame to my
body.

940
01:23:40,233 --> 01:23:44,267
By taking off clothes for
profit.

941
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:48,300
You'd do anything for money,
don't bullshit yourself.

942
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,300
Everything?
Everything.

943
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:56,300
Ah, give me a little music.

944
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:00,300
Hum a tune or something.

945
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:08,333
[humming]

946
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:20,367
You happy now?

947
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,433
If they never get you, they
will never get me.

948
01:24:28,433 --> 01:24:32,433
You live here like a king for
your silence.

949
01:24:32,433 --> 01:24:36,467
You're overreacting. We're
fine. Steve, listen.

950
01:24:36,467 --> 01:24:40,467
Did the cops ever even question
you about

951
01:24:40,467 --> 01:24:44,500
Nick's murder?
No.

952
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,500
You didn't even kill anybody
this time! And now

953
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,533
all of the sudden you think
they're going to come after you? This is

954
01:24:52,533 --> 01:24:56,533
a joke. These cops, they
couldn't even wipe their

955
01:24:56,533 --> 01:25:00,567
own asses if their shit was
made of toilet paper.

956
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,600
I hired you to kill Nick.

957
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,633
My regrets are none.

958
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:20,633
I should've stopped there.

959
01:25:20,633 --> 01:25:24,667
I threw all my money there and
here

960
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:28,667
trying to clean up all this
mess.

961
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:32,700
I'm left with nothing.
We got it.

962
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,867
Let's go.

963
01:25:34,867 --> 01:25:38,867
I wish I could just go to bed.

964
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:42,867
When I wake up, all this is
gone.

965
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:46,900
[knocking]

966
01:25:56,133 --> 01:26:00,200
Can I help you?

967
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:04,133
Steve Banerjee. You're under
arrest for racketeering, murder

968
01:26:04,133 --> 01:26:08,200
use of interstate commerce
facilities in the commission of a murder

969
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:12,200
for hire. You will be escorted
back to the Los Angeles men's detention

970
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:16,200
center by US Marshalls. Let's
not make this any more difficult than it

971
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:20,233
has to be. Open the door or
force will be used.

972
01:26:20,233 --> 01:26:24,233
I am so tired.

973
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:32,267
It's good to have you back.

974
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:36,300
They ate that routine up!
That's because you dance from experience

975
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:40,300
Chad tell you I got an acting
job? I'm going to be playing Jackson T.

976
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:44,300
Planet. The crime fighting rat
from another dimension.

977
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:48,333
It's a cartoon, but it's a start.
By the time I figure out they're not

978
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:52,367
dudes, not related, or age
free, I'm so over it.

979
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:56,367
These calendars are awesome.
Yeah, they're sold in every big bookstor

980
01:26:56,367 --> 01:27:00,467
We even sold out in a few
places.

981
01:27:00,467 --> 01:27:04,400
Hey. you fucking made it
No, no, no, we made it guys, we made it.

982
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,433
I'm starving man. I could really go for

983
01:27:08,433 --> 01:27:12,433
Let's go for it.
All right, there's

984
01:27:12,433 --> 01:27:16,467
a pizza place that's open 24 hours.
I'll buy.

985
01:27:16,467 --> 01:27:20,467
Let's go.

986
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:28,533
Excuse me.
Oh, thanks for coming down.

987
01:27:28,533 --> 01:27:32,567
This was supposed to be a
deposition.

988
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:40,600
What is so funny?
I know you, don't I?

989
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,633
I was afraid you'd remember.

990
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:48,667
Yeah, last time I saw you, you were just
Oh yeah, and you were half

991
01:27:48,667 --> 01:27:52,667
naked.
Yeah. I guess we both graduated.

992
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:56,667
You look good. In clothes.

993
01:27:56,667 --> 01:28:01,400
So, we don't need your
deposition after all. Mr. Banerjee saved

994
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,333
So Steve admitted everything?
He didn't have to. THe evidence was

995
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:09,367
overwhelming. He'll serve 26
years and he has to forfeit Chippendales

996
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:13,400
The sentencing is tomorrow.
So Uncle Sam

997
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:17,400
is going to run a strip club, huh?
He'll sell and keep the profits.

998
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:21,433
Counselor,

999
01:28:21,433 --> 01:28:25,433
you wanna get together.
Actually, I'm not so

1000
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:29,433
easy anymore.
I didn't mean it like that. I meant

1001
01:28:29,433 --> 01:28:33,467
for dinner?
Dinner.

1002
01:28:33,467 --> 01:28:37,500
Dinner?
Like an old-fashioned date?

1003
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:41,500
I would love to,

1004
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,500
As long as you promise to tell
me everything you know about Chippendale

1005
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:49,533
Deal.

1006
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:53,533
Nothing I can do can fix my
Karma.

1007
01:28:53,533 --> 01:28:57,533
There will be other chances for me.
The United States Government

1008
01:28:57,533 --> 01:29:01,533
is going to own Chippendales.

1009
01:29:01,533 --> 01:29:05,567
I will not let them have all my
hard work.

1010
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:09,600
I will take care of you as I
promised.

1011
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,600
How?
They will not get the best of me.

1012
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,600
You will see.

1013
01:29:29,667 --> 01:30:51,767
*

1014
01:31:19,867 --> 01:34:51,867
*
