00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,100
BUCHAREST NONSTOP

2
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,982
I don't love you anymore.

3
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:40,184
I never want to see you again.

4
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,506
Fuck off, dirtbag.

5
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:54,839
Here, boy!
Here!

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,722
I'm going to feed the dogs.

7
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,165
Come to mama, boys!

8
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:19,624
Yes, mother.

9
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,347
Didn't I say I'd come tonight?

10
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:25,230
Don't make me swear.

11
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,392
OK. I understood...

12
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:30,395
I can't talk, I'm packing.

13
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:32,397
Bye now.

14
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,852
I couldn't find cables.

15
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:47,973
So now what?

16
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:50,015
I'll take out the battery.

17
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:53,219
Why not ask the
taxi guy for cables?

18
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,462
You ask.

19
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,945
Come on.

20
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,988
Excuse me.
Do you have cables?

21
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:03,910
- Are you sure it's the battery?
- I think so.

22
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,992
Turn the key.

23
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:41,268
Hello!

24
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,631
How are you, sugar?

25
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:46,873
How's my baby?

26
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,875
Yes, handsome.

27
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:50,317
I love you too.

28
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,959
Yes, baby.

29
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,360
Tell me...

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,203
Yes, baby. I'm coming home.

31
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,765
Tonight!

32
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:01,128
You'll go to sleep and
find me there in the morning!

33
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,650
I'll wake you up.

34
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,811
Yes, baby!

35
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,533
Sure I got you
something, sugar.

36
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,896
No, baby, it's not a Panda!

37
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,659
Go to sleep now, honey.

38
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:12,780
Yes, dearest.

39
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,743
I love you too, baby!
Bye!

40
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm on my way.

41
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:37,285
I can't sorry.

42
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:44,132
OK, just the girdle.
OK, bye!

43
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:36,145
It's the battery.
I told you.

44
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,307
Can we borrow your cables?

45
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:40,069
- That's no good.
- Why?

46
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,593
It's the alternator.
Better get a battery.

47
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,955
My client's here.

48
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,797
What are you doing?

49
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,279
Are you moving out?

50
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,642
Weren't you going to work?

51
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,524
A client, right.

52
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:57,166
Please, give us the cables.

53
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:59,168
I can't. My client's here!

54
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:00,930
Maybe it'll work, though.

55
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,532
Come on, Marian, help them.

56
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:04,534
I know them. You'll get
the cables from Achim.

57
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:07,697
- Who's Achim?
- The guy at the store.

58
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,660
That's his name?

59
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,063
Hold this.

60
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:18,708
Leave them with him.
I need them too.

61
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:22,032
Swear to God.
Thanks so much!

62
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,635
- Thanks so much!
- Cheers!

63
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:27,678
Who's the hottie?

64
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,640
I don't know. I think
she lives in my building.

65
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,802
In your building, and
you don't know her?

66
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,084
I can't, Jeni.

67
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,567
Call me later.
I'll give you a ride now.

68
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,288
- Then we'll see.
- OK!

69
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,691
- What time's your train?
- 10.

70
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:44,655
We'll talk.

71
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:54,705
What was the name of that guy?
To get my cables back...

72
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:57,908
- Achim?
- Achim.

73
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:00,031
Achim, right.
Good guy!

74
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,873
- How do you know?
- I know him.

75
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,516
I love you so much...

76
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,840
We'll wake everybody up!

77
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,522
I have to charge the battery.

78
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:14,045
Right. I'll go get
the cables again.

79
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,447
A guy.

80
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,289
It's my friend's car.

81
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,371
A wreck.
What can I do?

82
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:22,694
I've got no money.

83
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,697
I said I'd take care of it!

84
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,138
Tomorrow.

85
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:29,621
I'll do it tomorrow.

86
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:34,466
Yeah, we'll go. We'll go to the mall
and get you that thing.

87
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:37,909
I love you too!
Bye now!

88
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,234
I don't know anybody in Bucharest.
But to fuck him...

89
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:44,996
I was just kidding.

90
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,880
Did you tell Giani?

91
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,522
What's Giani got
to do with me?

92
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,444
You've got nothing
to do with Giani?

93
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,766
I just pay him half, that's all.

94
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,330
Forget about Giani.
The guys I gave my cables.

95
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,932
How do you know them?

96
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,254
I just do.

97
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,817
And? Nothing?

98
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:06,739
You think everybody's...

99
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,782
Think they've got
money for that?

100
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:12,745
Those losers?

101
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,828
How do you know them?

102
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:21,954
I lived in the same
building with one of them.

103
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:24,437
Lived? Are you moving out?

104
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,719
Aren't you a curious one?

105
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,523
Do you like
what you do?

106
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:33,646
How's that your business?
Do you like what you do?

107
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:37,730
- Yes.
- Good. I like it too.

108
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,852
I love it.

109
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:46,139
He went away,

110
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,262
thought it over
and realized he was wrong.

111
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:52,746
Yeah, let's have him
do a real comparison.

112
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,628
Let him fuck
the whole block!

113
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,791
Yeah, that irony
really touched me.

114
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:01,034
Am I going crazy?
He's like an uber-fuck.

115
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,956
Screws anything on legs.

116
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:05,839
- He cheated on me!
- He admitted it!

117
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,881
So he's half forgiven.

118
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,484
We're interested
in the other half.

119
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,286
And he didn't
admit it, either.

120
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,368
Better it happened now
rather than later.

121
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:17,130
It's OK...
We're fine.

122
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,893
What a treat.
Not to be missed.

123
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:23,137
The ice-cream!

124
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:25,939
It must be soggy by now.
I'll put it in the freezer.

125
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,062
I like it soggy.
My teeth won't hurt.

126
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,545
If it's soggy it goes right
to the abs and thighs.

127
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,548
He didn't even pick up
his phone for a month!

128
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:37,711
Coward... didn't
even dare tell me.

129
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,434
It's like he's not
right in the head!

130
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,436
Well, you too were supposed to go
to the seaside with him

131
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:45,479
and went with that jerk to Sinaia!
The poor moron was waiting

132
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,762
to get laid, got
screwed instead.

133
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:50,725
We weren't even together for real.
I was undecided.

134
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:53,327
When in need
be undecided.

135
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,690
Virgil was a cool guy.

136
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,251
This is a redneck.

137
00:08:57,372 --> 00:08:59,253
And why go to
the seaside anyway?

138
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,376
Isn't he tanned enough?

139
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,460
I heard you, bitches!

140
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,542
It's not like he's Swedish!

141
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:08,903
So, are you going
to drive this time?

142
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,266
- I don't think it's OK.
- Why not?

143
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:14,509
Well, it's in your dad's name.

144
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,312
If anything happens,
I don't want trouble.

145
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:18,513
And I've never driven
a Dacia before.

146
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:21,756
- I haven't either!
- You drove the old one!

147
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:24,159
I'm not driving
this deathtrap.

148
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,321
It's the last time
I'm driving.

149
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,403
Word of honor!

150
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,165
He might have
sold it cheaper.

151
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,927
He would have, if I'd
paid him on the spot.

152
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:34,570
We would, afterwards.
Just as good.

153
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,652
We're paying as much
as for the other one.

154
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,453
- That one wouldn't even start!
- Like this one did.

155
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:41,256
It did. He paid 100 to have
the restrictor cleaned.

156
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:43,419
He could have sold it for scrap iron.

157
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,503
No way! You know why he didn't?
No one's looking for scrap iron.

158
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,665
We paid more than enough.

159
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:50,826
You just take care.

160
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,629
If you hadn't crashed the last one,
we'd still have it.

161
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,353
Easy. Just enough to bump it,
not to pay for the tow truck.

162
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:00,436
Why don't you drive,
if you're so smart?

163
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,358
Wasn't last time
supposed to be real?

164
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,120
Didn't I hit my head
without my seatbelt on?

165
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,122
- Don't get so fucking warped.
- Fuck off!

166
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,164
- I'm not driving this piece of shit!
- I'm not, either.

167
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,686
I won't drive it,
you won't drive it.

168
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,329
- So?
- So nothing.

169
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,414
What a douche.

170
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:21,057
That's why I love you.

171
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,860
We'll be ok.

172
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,623
Hey guys!
Can I have the intercom code?

173
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:28,024
Where are you going?

174
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,626
My girlfriend Dora,
second floor.

175
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:33,069
- Family name?
- No family. Just Dora, second floor.

176
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,473
- What are you, a detective?
- The codes 4869.

177
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,675
I'm on third floor,
apartment 32,

178
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,238
so I dial 486932.

179
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:44,201
Four... eight...
six... nine.

180
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,258
Fucking C!

181
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,076
You'll wait for me, right?

182
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,238
You know it doesn't pay
to keep the engine rolling.

183
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:23,160
Without that bag,

184
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,643
I could take a client
and come back.

185
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:28,926
It's in the trunk anyway,
what's it to you?

186
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,968
What if I get an
airport call?

187
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:33,531
The hell you will! It's gonna be
half an hour tops.

188
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,612
You'll wait, right?

189
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:36,894
OK, but after half an hour
you pay me double!

190
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:39,297
Yeah OK, I'll
pay you double.

191
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:30,829
Hello!

192
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,912
Giani, hi, man!
It's Marian, the taxi guy

193
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:34,633
who drives Jeni around.

194
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,275
Louder!

195
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,958
Quiet here.

196
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,760
Quiet! Right.

197
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,883
I called because I think...

198
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,205
Jeni is planning to scram.

199
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:48,728
Which Jeni?

200
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:51,090
Right, so?

201
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,813
She had a big bag
and asked me

202
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,895
to take her to the station.

203
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:57,857
What?

204
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,699
Bitch shut your mouth!

205
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,182
Can't you see
I'm on the phone?

206
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,865
And did you drive her there?

207
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,468
No, she's just gone
up to a client.

208
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,870
Well done. Where
are you?

209
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,833
Where uptown?
Be more specific.

210
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:16,156
Take the baby away.

211
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,438
Give me a reference point.

212
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:21,882
Near the Italian restaurant,
nearby the park.

213
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:25,045
What if I get a call...

214
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:28,688
Do you want that to be
the last call you ever take?

215
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,611
Keep her there.
I'm coming for her.

216
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,213
OK, OK.

217
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,815
Come along.

218
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,216
Not you. You.

219
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:39,740
Don't tell her
I told you, OK?

220
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,702
I called because you
did me a solid, so...

221
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:44,344
Nothing to do
with you, chill.

222
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,989
Fucking fuck.

223
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:53,394
Your problem is being
so subservient.

224
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:56,757
The moment someone loves you,
you're his bitch.

225
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,199
No wonder they love you.

226
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,801
You're gorgeous. Monica Belluci!

227
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,404
And she is gorgeous
as a petite.

228
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:05,967
I'm gorgeous
in the slender type.

229
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,569
Is someone throwing
pebbles at our window?

230
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,292
It's the third floor.

231
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,455
It's screwing with my ears.

232
00:14:14,816 --> 00:14:17,458
- It's him.
- Sweet!

233
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:20,822
He's standing there throwing
pebbles at the window!

234
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,344
They're all pigs.

235
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:27,228
I'll throw boiling
water at him.

236
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:30,191
And I'll close the window.

237
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,272
It's him.

238
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,955
- Pick up!
- Don't pick up.

239
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,448
Dorica!

240
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,462
Come here!

241
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:03,225
Hey, doggie!
Here!

242
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,589
You too, boy.
That's right.

243
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,012
Fuck off!

244
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,416
Ma'am!

245
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:36,219
Could you please
buzz me in?

246
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,820
Punch the code in.

247
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,862
I forgot it, ma'am.

248
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,344
No code, no getting in.

249
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,947
- Please, ma'am!
- Phone them!

250
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,789
Come on ma'am,
buzz me in.

251
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:49,352
Fucking hag!

252
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:55,638
Ma'am, please
buzz me in!

253
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,682
Fuck, I think I gave
him the wrong code.

254
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,204
I just do it by heart.
One, two three, like this.

255
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,126
See you don't run
into him tomorrow!

256
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:05,809
So? Fuck,
why doesn't he know the code?

257
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,091
He can blow me.

258
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:13,016
I think he tricked you.

259
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:15,018
Noticed the way he looked?

260
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:16,740
How's that?

261
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,143
You gave him the code.

262
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:22,786
Tomorrow you might come back
to an empty apartment.

263
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:25,028
That would suck ass.

264
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:30,034
Why didn't you just
give him the keys?

265
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,756
Save him the trouble of
breaking down the door.

266
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:35,039
Man. We play
tricks on some,

267
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,002
and others play tricks on us.
I mean, on you.

268
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:39,643
It's a fucking jungle!

269
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:42,206
Law of compensation!

270
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:46,090
So what's he going to take?
My dad's pension?

271
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,852
I don't care.

272
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:49,573
I'm going away.

273
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:51,495
Does your dad know
you're leaving?

274
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:52,817
Sure he does.

275
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,739
Is he OK with it?

276
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,861
The hell he is.

277
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,823
He thinks I should give it up,

278
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:01,506
that she must have found
someone else there!

279
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,548
- What if she has?
- She hasn't.

280
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,990
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:11,316
I'll get the money and
take her to England.

282
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:14,159
Where's she staying now?

283
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,522
You said she was looking after
an old hag who died?

284
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:18,883
She did.

285
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:20,725
- She's dead, right?
- Right.

286
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:23,048
She moved in
with a girlfriend.

287
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:26,731
- A girlfriend with a dick.
- Man, you're a douche.

288
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:30,735
- Fucking sleazeball.
- Say you love her, man.

289
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:31,817
Fucking say it.

290
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,739
Yeah, man, I love her.
What if I do?

291
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,580
You and...

292
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:40,065
Romeo and what's
her name...

293
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:43,468
What's your mother's name?

294
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,433
Who's there?

295
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:52,478
It's you...

296
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:57,002
Why don't you
answer when I call?

297
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:02,047
Who did you think it'd be?

298
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,809
My mother?

299
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:07,093
And if you heard
the door close,

300
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:10,656
didn't you hear the
key in the lock?

301
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,858
Five minutes ago
I told you..

302
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:15,942
I'd go downstairs
to feed the dogs.

303
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,985
Who do you think it
was?

304
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:23,750
Why didn't you tell me?

305
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:27,914
Didn't I?

306
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:31,157
I told you I was going downstairs
to feed the dogs?

307
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:33,239
When you don't
want to hear,

308
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,762
you pretend to be
asleep.

309
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,725
You expected a note from me?

310
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:41,488
Stop yelling.

311
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,851
I heard the key in the lock

312
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,853
and I freaked out.

313
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:49,136
Who did you think it was?

314
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:52,018
No one's got the key.

315
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:54,141
We've got no one!

316
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,703
That's what I'm saying.

317
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:59,866
We're as lonely as
two broken toys.

318
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:03,070
If we die...

319
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,112
no one has the key.

320
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:08,956
They'll break down the
door just to bury us.

321
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,558
We've just had it changed!

322
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,122
That's what you care about.

323
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:17,244
That they'll break
down the door.

324
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,286
Maybe you'll get an invoice

325
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,929
in heaven, by fax.

326
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:23,410
You might have
a heart attack

327
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:26,814
when you see the
cost of a lock!

328
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:29,457
We'd better take someone in

329
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:32,460
to look after us,
leave them the house.

330
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,345
Why? Where, in
these two rooms?

331
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:39,147
I would sleep in the hallway.

332
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,269
Not to live here.

333
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:45,033
Just to come in and
look after us.

334
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:48,236
How long will you be
able to get around?

335
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:51,199
We're all alone here.

336
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,401
We'll starve to death!

337
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:56,805
You fought with the neighbors

338
00:19:57,045 --> 00:20:00,008
over your stray dogs.

339
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:03,491
Those that bit the
Japanese tourist.

340
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:06,575
No one will be here
to feed us.

341
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:09,457
So what should I do?
Let them kill my dogs?

342
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:13,862
It's not like they all bit him.

343
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,184
Just one!

344
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,667
How do they know
it was our dog.

345
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:20,989
and not one from
next door?

346
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:24,473
And after all what was
the Japanese doing in Romania?

347
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,076
Maybe he had some
business in Romania.

348
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,318
In Bucharest.

349
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,240
Right on our street.

350
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,643
He had an itch to come
here. He deserved it!

351
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,845
Jeez, woman.

352
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:38,567
That man died!

353
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:41,931
Does that mean
they should kill all my dogs?

354
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:44,733
Find the one that bit him,

355
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,936
and kill that one.

356
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:50,820
What was that?

357
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,022
- What?
- What's that noise?

358
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:55,064
Nothing.

359
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:57,266
Don't you hear it?

360
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,629
Outside the window!

361
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,671
I don't hear anything.

362
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:04,714
They should have a
poll on TV.

363
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:07,437
Do you think it
was a dog from

364
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:11,080
entrance A or entrance B?

365
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,603
Now you can hear!

366
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:19,329
What's that?

367
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,223
- Cheers!
- Hey.

368
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:38,789
A pack of cigarettes. Superlight.

369
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,272
- Is this OK?
- Yeah.

370
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:43,994
Anything else?

371
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:46,477
A pack of gum.

372
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,239
Professional or super-white?

373
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,202
- Which one's cheaper?
- Same price.

374
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:55,045
Those. Whatever!

375
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,207
Professional.

376
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,734
Got 3 lei in change?

377
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:08,659
- No.
- Me neither.

378
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,302
Can I get you a cake instead?

379
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,784
Instant coffee?
A condom?

380
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:16,627
It's OK, thanks.
No problem.

381
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:18,629
Thanks!

382
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:22,593
- I need a favor.
- What?

383
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,475
Do you have a
Nokia charger?

384
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:25,997
What kind?

385
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:29,200
- Nokia.
- Nokia, but what kind?

386
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,202
What? For a Nokia phone!

387
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,084
There are several kinds.

388
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:35,927
A thin jack, a thicker one...

389
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:39,050
- This is the phone.
- This piece of junk?

390
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,933
You need a thick jack!
I haven't got that.

391
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:43,975
Anything else?

392
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:49,381
What, are you checking
my phone?

393
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,744
You got me wrong.
I was going to ask you to borrow it.

394
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,467
- Get lost.
- I had a fight with my girl.

395
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:57,869
Fucking asshole.

396
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:10,082
My phone battery is dead...
Please...

397
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:12,284
I forgot the intercom code.

398
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:14,807
I mean I forgot it...

399
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,650
Why do you think it's gonna be
better near a restaurant?

400
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,852
Listen. There's a
lot of money there.

401
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,974
We might get lucky and come
across a boozed-up moron.

402
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:24,336
We'll make a ton of money.

403
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,020
First, we'll go
to Di Darius.

404
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,184
If it's a no-go, then Acvatic.

405
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,629
You can't see inside.

406
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:38,551
Let's do the intersection!

407
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,313
It was OK last time!

408
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:43,116
And we need to
be both in the car.

409
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:45,758
Remember how that guy
wanted to beat me up.

410
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,000
What can I do alone?

411
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,641
Are you deaf?

412
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:50,243
There's more money this way.

413
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,205
Which we split halfway,
but I do all the work.

414
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:54,167
I drive, I do the work,
thanks for nothing.

415
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,209
There's just more
money this way.

416
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:58,892
- You don't get it...
- OK... Shut it.

417
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:16,950
Not even half an hour.

418
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:22,195
Why do you sit
in the backseat?

419
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:25,279
I need to change
for the train trip.

420
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,081
This is for you!

421
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:31,085
It's too much!
The waiting's 20 lei, tops.

422
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,367
- There's no need...
- Take it!

423
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:35,129
It's OK, keep it.

424
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,770
Best of luck!

425
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,372
This is my lucky day.

426
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:40,574
Have a drink on
me off-shift.

427
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,696
Take these, too.

428
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:45,459
What should I do
with them?

429
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:47,742
I don't know.
Give them to a chick.

430
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,424
Got a chick?

431
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:53,147
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do.

432
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,750
Give them to her, then.

433
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:11,366
What are you
looking at?

434
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,928
Come on, Marian...

435
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:16,371
Haven't you seen
pussy before?

436
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:20,295
- Haven't you?
- Come on, Jeni!

437
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,378
If I'd known,

438
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,060
I'd give it to you for free.

439
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,621
Jeni!

440
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,503
Come on,
don't be like that.

441
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,546
I'm in a hurry now.
If I weren't...

442
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,950
I'm sorry I'm in a hurry.
Shall we go?

443
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,872
Tell me which way to take.

444
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:39,915
To the train station.
I don't know.

445
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:45,761
Train station... OK.

446
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:48,764
What the...

447
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,367
Fucking shit.

448
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:54,329
- What's wrong?
- My battery died.

449
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,172
And you made me give
my cables away.

450
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:02,458
Call me another cab. Marian!

451
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:26,883
I'm in a hurry!

452
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:30,286
I'll charge it just a bit.

453
00:26:30,366 --> 00:26:33,089
The hell you are.
Call me a cab!

454
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:35,652
I'm driving you, OK?

455
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:37,854
Help us out?
Get real.

456
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,736
Those who take care of you

457
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:42,579
are in fact looking to
take your house.

458
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,542
They have you sign papers,

459
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:51,067
then blow up a firecracker
so you'd have a heart attack.

460
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:54,831
Remember Mrs. Marinescu?

461
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:57,154
The staircase rattled!

462
00:26:57,274 --> 00:26:59,476
Didn't you say,

463
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:02,719
if you were
to die before me

464
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,603
there'd be no one to
light a candle for you?

465
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:10,367
Didn't you say that
every single day?

466
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:13,090
On and on...

467
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:24,862
And no one blew
a firecracker on her.

468
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:27,064
She was nuts.

469
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:31,028
She threw the Tupperware
at them.

470
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:35,313
They came everyday
to bring her food,

471
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:38,356
and she'd keep them
on the doorstep.

472
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,279
The hell they came.

473
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,081
How do you know?

474
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,685
You've been bed-ridden
for four years.

475
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,248
You told me!

476
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:55,853
You said Mrs. Marinescu
was lucky to have those two kids

477
00:27:55,934 --> 00:28:02,300
bringing her food every day.

478
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,343
They couldn't come
into the building

479
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:08,106
because of your straydogs.

480
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:13,351
They were knocking over
their Tupperware.

481
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:18,316
That was in the beginning.

482
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:21,039
Mrs. Marinescu told me

483
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:25,604
after that they'd only
bring her potato stew.

484
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:30,529
Potato stew until there was no
potato stew anymore.

485
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,373
No wonder the dogs
left them alone.

486
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:36,495
They couldn't smell the meat.

487
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:41,460
Meat or no meat,
they came every day.

488
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,904
Do I have meat every day?

489
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:49,508
Maybe you do, wherever
you go all day long.

490
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,872
I'm as good as alone.

491
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:56,756
It's been like this since
I was in the army.

492
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,801
Not again!

493
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,928
I won't remind you that

494
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:14,614
I didn't decide on my own
to have that abortion.

495
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:16,976
You forced me.

496
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,298
Don't start it again.

497
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:23,703
We said a million times
we'd never bring it up again.

498
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:25,425
I'm this close to death and

499
00:29:25,545 --> 00:29:30,070
you've pestered me for
45 years with this!

500
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,153
Did I start this fight?

501
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:38,318
Today, I didn't say anything...

502
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,683
You told me I should
have left a note

503
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:45,686
when I went to feed the dogs.

504
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:48,368
And why didnt I
wake you up?

505
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,132
And why don't we bring
someone to take care for us,

506
00:29:52,212 --> 00:29:53,854
since we're alone.

507
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,776
No wonder we're alone.

508
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:58,098
You drove me mad
with your jealousy!

509
00:29:58,178 --> 00:29:59,900
And you forced me to
have that abortion

510
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,664
because you weren't sure
it was your baby.

511
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:06,267
So we're alone.

512
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,953
You were gone for months.

513
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,156
Some officer!

514
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:18,359
That's why you married me.
I was an officer.

515
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:21,562
Serving wherever my
country needed me.

516
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:24,325
And sending you
the paycheck.

517
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,287
No wonder you were bored

518
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,930
and wasted your time
playing rummy

519
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,652
with that dyed-up Mrs. Groza.

520
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:35,096
That's where you
met that punk, too.

521
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:38,019
I should have gotten
a divorce then.

522
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:41,623
I was so ready to
divorce you.

523
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:43,585
Your mother objected.

524
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:45,947
"What would the
neighbors say?"

525
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:49,351
Like I'd married the neighbors.

526
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:51,593
The neighbors were to envy her

527
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:54,115
for such a nice
daughter-in-law.

528
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:57,439
Nice. I was her punching bag.

529
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,683
I shouldn't have agreed
to live with your mother.

530
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:05,807
She made you think it
wasn't your child.

531
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:09,851
Just put my SIM card
into your phone.

532
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:11,413
It costs nothing.

533
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:14,937
No phone. Get lost,
you're scaring customers away.

534
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,819
What customers?
There's nobody here...

535
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:20,542
Please! It costs nothing,
I'll use my SIM card!

536
00:31:20,622 --> 00:31:22,144
I'll give you my phone.

537
00:31:22,224 --> 00:31:23,425
Some phone!

538
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:28,070
Just stand by the door.
Someone's bound to come out.

539
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,952
You think I didn't
try that?

540
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,715
A guy came out and asked
where I was going.

541
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:34,637
Dora, I said.

542
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,080
- Who?
- Dora.

543
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,322
I don't know her.

544
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,404
Then an old hag came out
to feed the dogs.

545
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:44,487
I know her. Mrs. Anton,
the building commissioner.

546
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,729
No one comes in without
her knowing.

547
00:31:51,654 --> 00:31:53,496
Fucking douchebag.

548
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:54,617
What are you doing?

549
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:56,819
What's the hurry?
What happened?

550
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,262
I think I'm running
out of gas.

551
00:31:59,342 --> 00:32:01,464
Didn't you put some gas?

552
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:05,108
Just 30 lei's worth. I kept
it running to charge the battery.

553
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:07,430
Why did you keep it
running 'till now?

554
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,473
What if it stops just when
I'm supposed to leave?

555
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:12,075
You should have
spent 50 lei on gas.

556
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:14,798
Why not 50?
I didn't have 50, you moron.

557
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,720
Jerk-off.

558
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,923
You drive and I'll
keep watch, how's that?

559
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:21,084
Oh, really?

560
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:24,327
I'll put up a reserve fund so
we don't run out again.

561
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:26,450
What money?
We spent all of our money.

562
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,131
What did you
spend it all on?

563
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:31,455
I have no money...
I have problems.

564
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,297
Fuck off!

565
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:36,460
Please don't talk about
my mother like that.

566
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,543
She wanted the best for us.

567
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:44,868
How did we come
to her again?

568
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,992
She's been dead 20 years!

569
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:49,793
God rest her soul.

570
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:53,998
She cooked for you and
did your laundry,

571
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:56,921
since you never
had a job in your life.

572
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:02,126
You were visiting
Mrs. Crazy-Dye all day long.

573
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:06,491
My mother was
not your servant!

574
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,584
I thought we weren't
talking about her anymore.

575
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:23,107
What are you talking about?

576
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:25,950
Now you're singing
her praises!

577
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:30,795
Didn't I take her
to the doctor?

578
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:36,001
Here and there
and everywhere?

579
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:43,208
Let's just finish this.

580
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:53,619
You'll be dead
and there'll be...

581
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,823
no one to light
a candle for me.

582
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,907
I can't count on you...

583
00:34:01,987 --> 00:34:04,229
in this world...

584
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,072
or the next either.

585
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:13,199
Enough.

586
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:26,893
You are wasting
your time here.

587
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:30,696
- Go home, charge your phone.
- I live in Magurele.

588
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,659
- Near the Physics Institute?
- Where should I go?

589
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,343
I have a cousin working there.
He says there are radiations!

590
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,145
- Radiations?
- Yeah.

591
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:41,628
Ball out from the court.

592
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,710
Out.

593
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:51,958
What if she's with
someone else?

594
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:53,600
Maybe that's why
she won't answer.

595
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,161
Thought about that?

596
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:58,084
I'd stand by the door just to
see who comes out.

597
00:34:58,205 --> 00:34:59,286
I did that once.

598
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:00,847
waited all night
and caught her.

599
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,729
I slapped the shit
out of her.

600
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,293
Fucking bitch. She thought
I was at a rock concert.

601
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:08,415
Where did she live?

602
00:35:08,495 --> 00:35:10,577
- Who?
- The chick you slapped.

603
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:12,459
A house. Why?

604
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:14,381
That's easier. You stand
outside and see what

605
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,303
motherfucker comes out,
and bam!

606
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:18,705
There's hundreds in a building.

607
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:22,149
I can't ask all of them
where they were.

608
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,952
At least if anyone came out!

609
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:27,274
You've got a point there.

610
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:31,799
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

611
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,773
So what did you do?
Why did you argue?

612
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,895
You must have
done something.

613
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:50,738
I did.

614
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,463
What's the difference if you
won't let me use your phone?

615
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:08,036
Have you got an ID on you?

616
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:16,244
- No.
- No?

617
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:17,726
No. What's it to you?

618
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:19,608
You want my name?

619
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:23,211
It was good collateral.

620
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,700
Are you listening?
The douche is leaving.

621
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,021
- Now?
- Yes, now.

622
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:13,943
Are you sure?

623
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:15,865
Yeah, now.

624
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:18,067
I can't drive if
I'm on the phone.

625
00:37:18,147 --> 00:37:19,869
I'm putting you on speaker!

626
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,553
Make sure you can hear me.
Watch out, OK?

627
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:26,156
- Go ahead.
- Wait a moment.

628
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,557
Tell me...

629
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:28,878
A black Audi, I think.

630
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,960
Audi? What color?

631
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,602
Black.

632
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:35,045
He left.

633
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:38,168
He's leaving right now.

634
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:41,932
He's climbing into the car.

635
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:44,735
Stand by!

636
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:47,898
- When's he coming?
- In a moment.

637
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,062
Stand by!

638
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:55,065
I see a car.

639
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:57,387
What car?

640
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:58,469
That's not it.

641
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,551
I'll tell you when.

642
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:04,234
It's coming round
the corner now.

643
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:08,038
In a few seconds.
He is coming in your direction.

644
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,360
Take care!

645
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,441
I can see him.

646
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:13,524
When I got there he
didn't even know me.

647
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:16,327
What's your favorite
sex position?

648
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,012
What are you doing,
Are you blind?

649
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:24,055
- We've got right of way, dick!
- I've got right of way.

650
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,496
Un-fucking-believable.

651
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:28,739
- What fucking right of way!
- The fucking right of way!

652
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:31,863
- I've got right of way!
- You're a fucking idiot, man.

653
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,624
- What are you doing?
- Blood.

654
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:35,586
- Is the leather stained?
- I've got a concussion.

655
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,188
- Is the leather stained?
- My head...

656
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:39,310
- Let me see.
- No.

657
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,913
You've got paper tissues in there.

658
00:38:41,993 --> 00:38:43,955
Let me.

659
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:47,158
Unbelievable, what a moron.

660
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,962
Let's go.

661
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:54,566
It's not stopping.

662
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:56,888
I'm taking her to
the hospital and

663
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,891
we'll go to the police tomorrow.

664
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:02,654
- Got insurance?
- It's dad's car. Maybe he does.

665
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:04,576
I say we go to the police now
so I can have the papers done.

666
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:08,020
- Are we going already?
- What police? Fuck them.

667
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,901
I'll give you money to fix
this piece of shit.

668
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:11,223
How much is the wing?

669
00:39:11,303 --> 00:39:13,865
My dad will kill me.
I say we call the cops.

670
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:17,189
Let's go, please.
Or at least let me sit in the car.

671
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:20,392
- Patience!
- I'm not feeling well.

672
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:22,514
Listen.

673
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:25,157
Let's work it out.

674
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,121
- I'll give you 300 for the wing.
- Not interested.

675
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,923
If there are no casualties,
the cops don't come.

676
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,325
I'm still bleeding.
Let's go to the police.

677
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:35,648
She's hurt. Why not
go to the police?

678
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:37,770
I need the paperwork
to fix my car.

679
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,891
It's better all around.

680
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,613
No need. Wait...

681
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,335
Here's another 200
for the car shop.

682
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:45,298
The mechanic won't fix
my car without the paperwork.

683
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:47,660
You call the police, I've got
no credit on my phone.

684
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,941
Why won't you call?

685
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:50,663
Have you been drinking?
I haven't!

686
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:53,946
- I'm taking a cab.
- Have you been drinking?

687
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,069
Are you DUI?

688
00:39:56,629 --> 00:39:59,232
Take the money.
Please take the money

689
00:39:59,312 --> 00:40:03,196
- I'm not interested.
- Please take it!

690
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,519
It's the third!
I thought you'd quit!

691
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,521
I'm not sure I'm keeping it.

692
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:11,524
See what he's doing?
Calling me every five minutes.

693
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:13,366
So why not answer?

694
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:15,809
You have to talk.

695
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:18,371
Get me an ashtray.

696
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:20,293
If I said it's over, it's over!

697
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:21,775
He went away with her,
he can stay gone.

698
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:25,178
Good. I never liked him.

699
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,422
Look at people's reaction.

700
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:31,545
At the baptism party,
they wouldn't let him in

701
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,388
I like him. I think his
bad guy act is sexy.

702
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:37,271
Didn't you say looks don't
matter if he's a good guy?

703
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,833
No sign of him for a month.
Some good guy.

704
00:40:39,913 --> 00:40:42,356
Now he's calling
you non-stop.

705
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:43,557
Why can't you pick up?

706
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:46,400
Why should she?
Is she remote-controlled?

707
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,921
Now you speak, now you don't.

708
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:52,006
How long did he not
answer his phone?

709
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:54,408
A month...

710
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,852
And she should pick up
now that he wants to talk.

711
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:59,693
Fuck the slimebag.

712
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:01,776
I'm not picking up.

713
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:04,899
I wish I knew what
he wanted, though.

714
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:09,503
I don't know who told him that
I cried over him for a month.

715
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:12,467
- Not me.
- Yeah, I did.

716
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:16,350
I like him so much I can't
keep secrets from him.

717
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:18,673
Asshole.
She told him!

718
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:46,902
Where the fuck did
I tell you to wait?

719
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,585
Jeni! Where are
you going?

720
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:51,747
I had a client.

721
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:54,309
I didn't ask you what you had.
I asked where you were going.

722
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,791
I'm going home.
I had a client.

723
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:57,993
- Do I look stupid?
- No Giani, I just had a client.

724
00:41:58,073 --> 00:42:00,796
Marian, tell him, I had a client.
I'm going home.

725
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:03,759
Shut the fuck up.
Go take that bag out!

726
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,602
- What bag?
- What bag?

727
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:08,964
Jeni, get back here!

728
00:42:09,084 --> 00:42:13,128
Don't make me hit
You. Get in!

729
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,693
Fucking shit, get the
bag out already!

730
00:42:17,813 --> 00:42:20,896
Faster! Take the
fucking bag out!

731
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:23,059
- Mr. Giani, we didn't agree on that.
- What did we agree on?

732
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:25,501
We agreed you'd wait.
Take out the bag.

733
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:26,702
Leave the bag in!

734
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:29,505
I'll punch your face in.
Get in the car!

735
00:42:29,585 --> 00:42:31,467
- If you'd known...
- If you'd known, what?

736
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:33,669
I'll fucking punch your lights out,
too.

737
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:35,551
What's wrong with you?

738
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:37,994
Fucking Teddy Bear...

739
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:51,688
I got scared, that's
why I asked.

740
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:56,613
When I used to go
shopping and came back

741
00:42:56,733 --> 00:42:58,415
with my grocery bags

742
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,778
didn't you ask,
"Are you back?"

743
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:07,344
I was there, you could see.
Still you asked.

744
00:43:07,824 --> 00:43:10,947
What was I to say: "No?"

745
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:17,594
That's what people say when
they've got nothing to say.

746
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:22,679
which reminds me...

747
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,967
Could you bring me a pillow
for m back? I'm heating up.

748
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,777
What time does Mrs. Chelba
come for my injection?

749
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:43,901
Are you listening to me?
Are you asleep?

750
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:48,466
That's so you.

751
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:56,674
You start the fight
and want to end it, too.

752
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:01,679
That's no longer married life.

753
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:36,395
- Hello!
- Hello.

754
00:44:36,475 --> 00:44:38,637
Can I have...

755
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,961
I'd like.
a sparkling water and cigarettes.

756
00:44:44,123 --> 00:44:46,044
Anything to eat?

757
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:49,728
Will you ask or not?
If not, we won't do it.

758
00:44:49,848 --> 00:44:53,172
And some special ice-cream.
I got it.

759
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,094
Coming right up.

760
00:44:58,457 --> 00:45:00,299
Take this.

761
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:01,660
And this, too.

762
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,222
Thanks a lot. How much?

763
00:45:03,302 --> 00:45:05,144
Twenty-five.

764
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,829
Got five lei?

765
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:11,751
It's ok.

766
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:13,673
Do you prefer flavored?

767
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,114
No.

768
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:16,636
Thank you!

769
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,237
Good luck!

770
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:23,242
Hey you!

771
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:24,924
Come here.

772
00:45:25,044 --> 00:45:27,727
- Me?
- Yeah. Come here.

773
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:37,497
What did you say
your name was?

774
00:45:37,617 --> 00:45:40,060
Teddy. Teodor,
but they call me Teddy.

775
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,982
Achim. Nice to
meet you.

776
00:45:42,062 --> 00:45:44,824
Now that we've
met, I'll help you.

777
00:45:44,905 --> 00:45:46,546
Tell me your chick's name
and I'll call her.

778
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:48,789
- For real?
- For real.

779
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:50,310
Are you making fun of me?

780
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,713
Enough. Tell me the number.

781
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:57,638
0766459692...

782
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:00,881
Wait. 594...

783
00:46:03,203 --> 00:46:05,566
You don't know her number?'

784
00:46:05,686 --> 00:46:07,488
And you say you're in love.

785
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:10,691
I have it in my phone.

786
00:46:11,732 --> 00:46:13,934
It's not like you know
your numbers by heart.

787
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:16,016
Tell me your wife's
number let's see.

788
00:46:16,136 --> 00:46:20,781
I don't need to know it by heart.
I got no wife, sucker. Get it?

789
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,104
But I know the numbers
I need to know.

790
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:24,585
Tell me one that
you know.

791
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:25,826
Are you dumb?

792
00:46:25,906 --> 00:46:28,669
I can tell you any number
whether I know it by heart or not.

793
00:46:28,749 --> 00:46:30,231
You wouldn't know!

794
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:32,113
Take my mom's number.

795
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:36,717
0723456789.
How will you check?

796
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:41,162
Write it down, and I'll look
it up in your contacts.

797
00:46:41,242 --> 00:46:45,406
Yeah like I'm gonna I've out
my phone to check it.

798
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,248
- Give me a break.
- No, man.

799
00:46:47,368 --> 00:46:50,692
You said 0723456789.
Right?

800
00:46:50,812 --> 00:46:52,814
Now write it down
and we'll see

801
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:55,697
if it's under "Mommy",
or whatever.

802
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:57,459
I'm messing with you, man.

803
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:01,022
456789 is just a joke.

804
00:47:01,142 --> 00:47:02,704
Tell me her real number.

805
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:04,466
What am I, dumb?

806
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:06,027
Why do you want my
mama's number?

807
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:09,191
I don't. I was gonna prove
you don't know it by heart.

808
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:11,713
If you're afraid, tell
me another number.

809
00:47:11,793 --> 00:47:13,995
Of course I'm afraid.
Look at your face.

810
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:15,477
What's wrong with my face?

811
00:47:15,557 --> 00:47:18,280
You think I'm gonna
ask your mama out?

812
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,002
Are you picking on my mama?
Enough already.

813
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:22,524
- I'm not, man!
- And I was going to help you.

814
00:47:22,604 --> 00:47:26,088
I'm not picking on your mama!

815
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,373
I was gonna prove you don't
know your numbers by heart!

816
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:33,255
Listen...

817
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,698
I don't think you
want to help me.

818
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:37,740
Motherfucking
douchebag rocker.

819
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,342
You picked on my
mama. Get lost.

820
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:44,587
I swear on my mother I wasn't
picking on your mother.

821
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:49,111
Only gypsies swear like that.
Are you a gypsy?

822
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:52,074
So that's why you're not giving me
your phone, 'cause I'm a gypsy?

823
00:47:52,154 --> 00:47:53,316
Are you?

824
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,998
What if? Have you got
something against them?

825
00:47:56,078 --> 00:47:57,160
No, but...

826
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,641
Are you a xenophobe?

827
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:00,083
A xenophobe?

828
00:48:00,163 --> 00:48:01,684
You don't know
what that is?

829
00:48:01,764 --> 00:48:04,447
Me, a xenophobe!

830
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:06,369
Meaning you don't
like gypsies.

831
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:08,331
Who does?

832
00:50:12,898 --> 00:50:14,740
Dorica!

833
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:44,170
How can I help you?

834
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,453
Did some guys leave some cables
here? They said they would.

835
00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:49,295
- They did.
- Where are they?

836
00:50:49,415 --> 00:50:51,738
- Gone. They took them again.
- Why?

837
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:55,862
Their battery is dead. They said
they'd bring them in later.

838
00:50:55,982 --> 00:50:58,625
Man oh man.

839
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:05,672
Never give away your things.

840
00:51:07,113 --> 00:51:10,917
Give me a coffee. Make it light.
I had three already.

841
00:51:11,158 --> 00:51:12,959
- Instant or filter?
- Filter

842
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:14,441
Instant gives me heart palpitations.

843
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:17,884
Take this, I'll make another.
Two lei.

844
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:20,968
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

845
00:51:21,048 --> 00:51:24,571
One thing. Can I
borrow your phone?

846
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:26,894
I need to call my girlfriend
here in the building.

847
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:30,257
We had an argument and
now my battery's dead.

848
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:32,299
I forgot
the intercom code, too.

849
00:51:32,419 --> 00:51:33,781
Why aren't you
standing by the door?

850
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:35,542
Go in when someone goes out.

851
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:37,905
- I tried that.
- You did?

852
00:51:38,025 --> 00:51:40,868
He did. I saw him.
That's not it.

853
00:51:40,988 --> 00:51:42,510
What is it, then?

854
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,111
Why won't you give
him your phone?

855
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:46,033
How could I?
Look at him!

856
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:47,475
What about him?

857
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,196
He's tanned. And it's
not from the sun.

858
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:52,039
What if he's tanned?
Are you scared?

859
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,722
What have you done?
Do you bite?

860
00:51:54,802 --> 00:51:58,005
Me? I didn't do anything.

861
00:51:58,085 --> 00:52:00,808
Come on, please.
I'll pay anything.

862
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:02,410
Give it to him, man.

863
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,214
You give it to him, if
you've got the guts.

864
00:52:06,975 --> 00:52:09,577
I would but I've got a client.
I called in five minutes.

865
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:12,060
Vacarescu street, entrance A.

866
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,423
I just came in for the cables.
And coffee.

867
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:16,205
Dora!

868
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:26,175
Dorica!

869
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:50,520
Where can I put this?

870
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,243
Here. At night I take
the container in.

871
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:55,886
They stole it even
with a chain on.

872
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,208
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

873
00:54:01,091 --> 00:54:02,572
What a thing.

874
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:03,814
About the container?

875
00:54:03,894 --> 00:54:06,136
About the phone.

876
00:54:06,256 --> 00:54:08,018
Were you afraid
he'd steal it?

877
00:54:08,138 --> 00:54:09,139
The container?

878
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:11,822
The phone, man.

879
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:17,027
Light up for me.

880
00:54:17,147 --> 00:54:19,069
Just a sec.

881
00:54:22,273 --> 00:54:24,315
About the phone thing...

882
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:28,439
I'd have given him the phone,
but did you see his face?

883
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,001
He might be a good boy,
but he's a gypsy.

884
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,726
Gotta watch your wallet.
Even if you know him.

885
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,009
Now that you're here I might
have given it to him.

886
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:40,691
He was here for an hour.

887
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:42,413
Is he gone?

888
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:47,899
A building full of hoes...

889
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:51,222
You seem to know about it.

890
00:54:51,342 --> 00:54:52,864
Are you married?

891
00:54:52,984 --> 00:54:56,347
Haven't found anyone
worth it. Hoes all over.

892
00:54:57,989 --> 00:55:00,111
I picked up Jeni from
here earlier on.

893
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:02,073
Jeni from the ground floor?
I know her.

894
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:04,195
She asked me to give
my cables to those guys.

895
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:06,237
- I know Jeni.
- A hoe.

896
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:08,760
A hoe?
What are you talking about?

897
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,725
A fucking hoe. Lucky she's got a guy
looking after her. Giani.

898
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:16,328
You know what she thought of today?

899
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:18,850
Do a couple of clients and
leave without paying Giani.

900
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,412
Go where?

901
00:55:20,492 --> 00:55:23,775
I don't know.
She had a fucking big bag.

902
00:55:23,976 --> 00:55:27,659
Fuck the hoe. Going
away without paying.

903
00:55:30,222 --> 00:55:33,385
Wasn't it her money?
It was her ass that got it.

904
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:35,187
He had her back against thugs.

905
00:55:35,307 --> 00:55:38,951
Giani saved her ass
many times.

906
00:55:39,071 --> 00:55:41,273
- Do you know this girl well?
- He helped her...

907
00:55:41,393 --> 00:55:43,796
Do you know why she
became a prostitute?

908
00:55:43,876 --> 00:55:46,038
Giani used to beat her

909
00:55:46,118 --> 00:55:48,721
She had shades on at night
to hide the blackened eye.

910
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:50,603
She bought yoghurt
from here.

911
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:54,246
Couldn't chew because her
jaw was wired up.

912
00:55:54,327 --> 00:55:56,289
Did you know Giani took
her away from Botosani

913
00:55:56,369 --> 00:55:59,612
and now he wants to sell her
to some pimp in Spain?

914
00:55:59,692 --> 00:56:02,255
Do you know what she's
been through?

915
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:04,897
She kept telling me we
might not meet again.

916
00:56:05,017 --> 00:56:08,381
I thought she was going to Spain,
but she was actually running away.

917
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:10,063
Fuck, man. Why
didn't she tell me?

918
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:13,666
I'd have given her a ride to the
station. Did she get beat up bad?

919
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:15,668
She got beat up
some, for sure.

920
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:18,391
How do you mow
he beat her up?

921
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:20,713
- How do I know?
- How do you know?

922
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,435
Tell me, how?

923
00:56:22,515 --> 00:56:25,118
A mate told me.
He drove her and saw.

924
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:27,360
He radioed me:
do you know Jeni...

925
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,362
See how you're
getting mixed up?

926
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:30,964
Didn't you say you
picked her up here?

927
00:56:31,044 --> 00:56:33,246
I did, but I drove her
to a client, not to the station.

928
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:36,890
Something's fishy.
She is a very nice girl.

929
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,532
Why is she a hoe. then?

930
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:40,253
It's not like she was
aiming for it.

931
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,816
Didn't he grab her by force?
She feared this Giani.

932
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:46,179
How do you know his
name was Giani?

933
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,063
From the girls. I drive
them around. They told me.

934
00:56:50,184 --> 00:56:51,585
So you know him, right?

935
00:56:51,705 --> 00:56:53,427
Give me his number,
I wanna call him.

936
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,469
I'll run him over,
the fucking sleazebag.

937
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:59,353
You're shitting your pants over a
guy asking to borrow your phone,

938
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:01,755
and now you're picking on Giani?
Do you even know who he is?

939
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,919
So you know Giani.
Give me your phone.

940
00:57:04,999 --> 00:57:06,801
He'll fucking punch
your lights out.

941
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,722
Let's see if you've got
his number.

942
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:10,124
You've got a thing
about phones!

943
00:57:10,204 --> 00:57:12,406
Give me your fucking phone.

944
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:15,409
I think it was you
who called Giani.

945
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:18,292
- You fucked up this girl's life.
- I've got a client.

946
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:21,656
Are you busy?
Did he beat her up badly?

947
00:57:21,736 --> 00:57:23,097
Fucking jerk-off.

948
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:26,461
Are you scared?
Are you running away?

949
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:28,983
Get the fuck out of here.

950
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:30,625
Fuck off, scumbag.

951
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,191
Hi.

952
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:38,275
Do you have a phone
I could borrow?

953
00:59:38,395 --> 00:59:41,118
I ran out of credit.
Do you have a cigarette?

954
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:44,962
Aren't you kinda young?

955
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:47,044
We're over 14.

956
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,263
Give me another pack of cigs. Lights.

957
01:00:05,383 --> 01:00:08,506
Have you smoked them all?
You just bought one.

958
01:00:08,626 --> 01:00:09,907
I gave some away.

959
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:11,749
And I'm not leaving
until I talk to her.

960
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,832
Even if Im here all night
and you close shop.

961
01:00:14,953 --> 01:00:17,435
It's non-stop, I can't close.
Give me your SIM card.

962
01:00:17,555 --> 01:00:18,676
Are you messing with me?

963
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,678
Give me your card already.

964
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:21,759
Didn't you go in, though?

965
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,002
Someone came out.
I thought you went in.

966
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:25,443
- When?
- Just now.

967
01:00:25,523 --> 01:00:27,886
I was at the back to see
if her bedroom light's on.

968
01:00:27,966 --> 01:00:29,848
- What's the pin number?
- 1234.

969
01:00:29,928 --> 01:00:32,851
Cool. Just like my
mom's number.

970
01:00:33,932 --> 01:00:35,654
It's working.

971
01:00:36,294 --> 01:00:38,216
What letter?

972
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:40,378
Dorica. Under D.

973
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:43,101
Dan, Danaila...

974
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,302
Wait.

975
01:00:44,383 --> 01:00:45,984
Who's Daniela Baby?

976
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:47,386
My step sister.

977
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:48,747
You're shitting me.

978
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:51,109
Step sister in the gypsy
community. Give me a break.

979
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,272
- Are you calling her?
- Shut up.

980
01:00:53,392 --> 01:00:54,953
Here she is. Dorica!

981
01:00:55,073 --> 01:00:57,356
Elena, Elisabeta...

982
01:00:57,476 --> 01:00:59,918
Who are these?
Cat got your tongue?

983
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:02,401
Teddy, boy, you
sure love pussy.

984
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:04,283
Don't you? Are you
calling her or what?

985
01:01:04,363 --> 01:01:05,444
Shut up.

986
01:01:05,524 --> 01:01:07,566
Are you gonna marry her?

987
01:01:07,646 --> 01:01:09,488
What's it to you?

988
01:01:09,568 --> 01:01:11,570
Help me talk to her.
The rest is my business.

989
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,253
If you don't want to marry
her, why do you insist?

990
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,375
I thought it was a serious thing.

991
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:18,658
I'm only helping young
people to start a family.

992
01:01:18,738 --> 01:01:21,100
Even if they're gypsies.
Is she a gypsy too?

993
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,182
We're not gypsies, man.
Are you calling her or what?

994
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,784
So, say it. Dafto, bulandro!

995
01:01:24,904 --> 01:01:27,386
Give me a break and
call her already.

996
01:01:27,507 --> 01:01:30,670
OK. You wanted Dorica,
we're calling Dorica.

997
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,231
I will ask her to
come down, but after

998
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:34,474
I will tell her about the
girls in your phone.

999
01:01:34,594 --> 01:01:36,796
- OK, give me my card.
- What's got your goat?

1000
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:40,200
- Give me my card.
- It's ringing. Shut up.

1001
01:01:42,402 --> 01:01:44,324
It's ringing.

1002
01:01:44,404 --> 01:01:46,766
- Answer that.
- Don't answer.

1003
01:01:46,846 --> 01:01:48,888
- Answer him!
- Don't answer.

1004
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:52,692
She hung up.

1005
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:54,734
Call again and let
me talk to her.

1006
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,977
Wait.

1007
01:01:57,057 --> 01:01:59,619
- Is it ringing?
- Yes. Shut up.

1008
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:06,827
She's holding strong.

1009
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:09,910
Wait.

1010
01:02:11,191 --> 01:02:13,674
- Hello!
- Miss Dora?

1011
01:02:13,794 --> 01:02:14,915
No, I'm not Teddy.

1012
01:02:15,756 --> 01:02:17,117
How can I explain...

1013
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:18,959
I'm calling from his card.

1014
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:20,120
It's not him.

1015
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,323
So you know Teodor,
right? Teddy.

1016
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:25,846
I know him. Why are you calling
from his card? Is he OK?

1017
01:02:25,926 --> 01:02:28,569
He's OK. He's next to me,
here at the non-stop.

1018
01:02:28,649 --> 01:02:31,772
His battery's dead, and
he asked me to call

1019
01:02:31,852 --> 01:02:34,175
and ask you to come downstairs cause
he doesn't remember

1020
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:35,296
the intercom code.

1021
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,738
He's asking you to go downstairs
and give him the intercom code.

1022
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:40,141
I never want to see him again.
I don't want to talk to him.

1023
01:02:40,221 --> 01:02:41,662
If he forgot the code,
he can't have it.

1024
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:45,987
Tell him I never want
to talk to him again.

1025
01:02:46,107 --> 01:02:48,269
If he forgot the code,
he can't have it.

1026
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,872
He forgot it tough luck.

1027
01:02:50,992 --> 01:02:53,194
She is not giving you
the code. Tough luck.

1028
01:02:53,314 --> 01:02:56,277
- Give it here. Let me talk to her.
- Shut up.

1029
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,839
Do you want me to shut the window?

1030
01:02:57,959 --> 01:03:01,162
Miss? Please come downstairs
and talk to him.

1031
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:03,244
He says you should
go talk to him.

1032
01:03:03,324 --> 01:03:05,366
- Should I go?
- Don't go.

1033
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:06,888
Tell him you're not going.

1034
01:03:06,968 --> 01:03:08,730
I'm not coming.

1035
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:11,293
- She's not coming.
- Let me talk to her!

1036
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:12,694
What do you want
me to tell her?

1037
01:03:12,774 --> 01:03:14,816
Tell her I'm sorry and I
want to apologize tonight.

1038
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:16,218
And she should give
me the code.

1039
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:20,021
Miss, he's sorry.
He apologizes.

1040
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:22,624
And please give him
the code please.

1041
01:03:22,704 --> 01:03:26,428
He says he's sorry.
See? He's sorry.

1042
01:03:26,548 --> 01:03:28,951
Why should she forgive him?
We decided she wouldn't.

1043
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,032
What the fuck?

1044
01:03:30,152 --> 01:03:32,354
He did wrong, he
should pay for it.

1045
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:33,876
You don't need his apologies.

1046
01:03:33,996 --> 01:03:36,638
Forgiveness is the greatest
virtue. I read that.

1047
01:03:36,758 --> 01:03:38,721
So what do I do
if he's sorry?

1048
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:41,083
- Like hell.
- He is sorry.

1049
01:03:41,163 --> 01:03:43,806
Hello! Is he sorry
or not?

1050
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,008
Let me ask him.
Are you sorry?

1051
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,170
Of course I'm sorry.
We should talk about it.

1052
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,612
Shut up, moron.

1053
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:53,736
Miss, he says he
wants back in

1054
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:55,738
so you can make up,
and he wants you.

1055
01:03:55,818 --> 01:03:57,940
- Just say what I tell you.
- I want to get her back.

1056
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,823
Just say what I tell you.
I'm sorry Dora.

1057
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:02,745
He says he wants you
to take him back in.

1058
01:04:02,825 --> 01:04:04,186
To make up.

1059
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:06,829
- I'm not ta ling him back.
- We're not taking him back.

1060
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:09,832
I'm taking him back, but
he should convince me.

1061
01:04:09,952 --> 01:04:11,434
He should convince us.

1062
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:14,837
Are you nuts? Didn't we decide
we're not having him back?

1063
01:04:14,957 --> 01:04:17,120
He should promise.

1064
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,762
She says you should promise.
I don't know what, but she's upset.

1065
01:04:19,883 --> 01:04:21,004
You made her cry.

1066
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:22,966
Let me talk to her already.

1067
01:04:23,046 --> 01:04:25,889
Dora I'm sorry. Dora,
I love you so much.

1068
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:27,490
I can't hear what
she's saying.

1069
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,332
Tell her I want to apologize.

1070
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:30,814
Do you want me to
close the window?

1071
01:04:30,894 --> 01:04:33,096
- He should admit it.
- Have him admit it.

1072
01:04:33,176 --> 01:04:35,699
If he does...
I'll see...

1073
01:04:35,779 --> 01:04:37,661
- Do you admit it?
- Admit what?

1074
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:40,464
Miss, please don't cry.
You made her cry.

1075
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:43,186
It's a shame to spill all
your tears over nothing.

1076
01:04:43,266 --> 01:04:44,628
What tears?

1077
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:46,470
Tears are not separate,

1078
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,192
happy tears in one place and
sad tears someplace else.

1079
01:04:49,313 --> 01:04:51,555
- What?
- I can't hear.

1080
01:04:51,675 --> 01:04:54,758
Now they'll all be sad tears.
I knocked her over.

1081
01:04:54,878 --> 01:04:56,360
You get me?

1082
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,603
- A beer, please.
- Inventory.

1083
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:01,405
- Isn't this a non-stop?
- You heard me!

1084
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:03,207
- Can't I...
- Get lost. We're closed.

1085
01:05:03,287 --> 01:05:05,809
Hello? I can't
hear him.

1086
01:05:05,889 --> 01:05:08,732
I'm asking you, please.
He deserves a chance.

1087
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:10,134
What's she saying?

1088
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:15,579
Look, this guy wants to propose and
you want to cry happy tears right?

1089
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:20,705
What tears, what propo...
I think he's going to propose.

1090
01:05:20,785 --> 01:05:24,428
What proposal, what's
all this about tears?

1091
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:27,992
- You're not nuts. Tell him no.
- I do, but not from a non-stop.

1092
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:30,114
I do but not from a non-stop.

1093
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:33,478
Please, miss.
He's here with flowers.

1094
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:37,962
He's got flowers and asking
you to take him back.

1095
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:41,886
I don't want flowers. And I don't
want a proposal from a non-stop.

1096
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:46,131
Go get some flowers, quick.

1097
01:05:47,932 --> 01:05:49,614
He hasn't got any flowers.

1098
01:05:49,694 --> 01:05:52,697
You can see him from the 2nd floor.

1099
01:05:52,777 --> 01:05:54,299
Did he bring snowdrops or what?

1100
01:05:54,379 --> 01:05:56,581
I'm not blind. He had
his hands in his pockets.

1101
01:05:56,661 --> 01:06:00,946
Give it to me. Let me decide
when and how I propose.

1102
01:06:01,026 --> 01:06:05,190
He says he'll decide
when to propose.

1103
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,873
- You are not helping me with this.
- What the hell do you want?

1104
01:06:07,993 --> 01:06:09,915
That's my business.
Let me talk to her.

1105
01:06:10,035 --> 01:06:11,196
I'm closing the window.

1106
01:06:11,316 --> 01:06:13,238
He is so nice...

1107
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:16,281
I think it's super-romantic.

1108
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:18,604
I wish it happened to me.

1109
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,607
There're five women
for every man on Earth.

1110
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:23,769
Let's not upset them.

1111
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:28,213
I think it's super-romantic.
I wish it happened to me.

1112
01:06:28,294 --> 01:06:30,015
If you don't go, I'll
give him the code.

1113
01:06:30,095 --> 01:06:31,657
Give him the code
to your house.

1114
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,499
- I haven't got a code.
- You haven't got a house.

1115
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:36,422
You're like her.
Collecting losers.

1116
01:06:36,502 --> 01:06:38,064
She's not alone.

1117
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:39,905
- Give it to me.
- Cut it out.

1118
01:06:39,985 --> 01:06:42,468
Are you messing with us?
Who's there with you?

1119
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:44,630
Mind your own business.
What's your deal here?

1120
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,952
You know what?

1121
01:06:46,072 --> 01:06:48,754
What do you mean,
what's my deal here?

1122
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:51,637
Am I wasting time
with you here? Fuck this.

1123
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,200
I'm trying to help,
and what do I get?

1124
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,562
I'm asking you,
please marry this girl.

1125
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:59,365
It's a shame, the way she's
crying for you. Marry her.

1126
01:06:59,485 --> 01:07:01,087
- Let me talk to her already.
- Shut up.

1127
01:07:01,207 --> 01:07:02,448
Not you, him...

1128
01:07:02,529 --> 01:07:06,653
I'll show you I'm a good guy.
I'll put him on, OK?

1129
01:07:06,733 --> 01:07:09,015
You're proposing now, OK?
In front of the non-stop.

1130
01:07:09,095 --> 01:07:11,978
- He's proposing.
- He's proposing.

1131
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,701
You don't propose
when you want.

1132
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,503
You propose when I want.

1133
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:20,507
I am pregnant with you
and you ask if it's yours.

1134
01:07:20,587 --> 01:07:22,549
How do I know?
I know.

1135
01:07:22,629 --> 01:07:24,151
You're shitting me.

1136
01:07:24,231 --> 01:07:31,158
Anyway, shouldn't we break up?
Good. We'll do as you said.

1137
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:33,200
Do you know the pain
I've been through?

1138
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,801
I'm taking my hand
off you.

1139
01:07:34,922 --> 01:07:39,726
I've cried myself silly the night
you said we should take a break.

1140
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,810
So? I just said you should decide

1141
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:45,853
what to do.
I was pregnant with you.

1142
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:48,095
Hello?

1143
01:07:48,455 --> 01:07:50,457
I think I ran out of credit.

1144
01:07:50,658 --> 01:07:51,819
Fucking...

1145
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:57,865
Talk it over. Like
people in love, right?

1146
01:07:58,426 --> 01:08:01,829
It was your fault anyway.
I asked you to be careful,

1147
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:05,633
I had no condoms, and you said
you didn't have any either

1148
01:08:05,753 --> 01:08:09,036
just to show me you weren't
seeing any whores.

1149
01:08:09,157 --> 01:08:13,161
I asked you to go to the non-stop
for some, why didn't you?

1150
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:16,764
You said they don't sell
condoms at the non-stop.

1151
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,208
I asked you to take care.

1152
01:08:20,648 --> 01:08:23,211
Man oh man.

1153
01:08:28,136 --> 01:08:30,298
I said I'd get pregnant.

1154
01:08:30,378 --> 01:08:34,502
You said water and soap were
the best contraceptive.

1155
01:08:35,263 --> 01:08:39,387
When I came back, you were
snoring like a drill press.

1156
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:41,389
I said when I was
in the bathroom

1157
01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:44,833
that I wanted a girl
who'd look like you.

1158
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:46,995
That I loved you, you moron.

1159
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:50,118
- Redneck.
- The bad boy.

1160
01:08:50,879 --> 01:08:53,121
Go quick, someone's
coming out.

1161
01:09:02,491 --> 01:09:04,653
I'm not coming.

1162
01:09:04,733 --> 01:09:08,137
You can't use me
and throw me away.

1163
01:09:08,697 --> 01:09:11,540
And don't come
here, either.

1164
01:09:13,222 --> 01:09:15,704
What flowers did you get me?

1165
01:09:17,346 --> 01:09:19,428
Hello?

1166
01:09:19,709 --> 01:09:21,831
Hello?

1167
01:09:22,832 --> 01:09:25,314
You bastard!

1168
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,799
Want a Coke?

1169
01:09:29,919 --> 01:09:31,961
Cold?

1170
01:09:33,923 --> 01:09:35,965
- Chocolate, too?
- No, I don't.

1171
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:37,847
Yeah you do.

1172
01:09:42,852 --> 01:09:44,334
Cheers.

1173
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:46,216
Are you back?

1174
01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:48,578
- I came for the cables.
- So you're back.

1175
01:09:48,658 --> 01:09:50,980
- Give me a Coke.
- What kind?

1176
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,902
Whatever you've got.

1177
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:54,784
And water.

1178
01:09:54,864 --> 01:09:57,187
- Still?
- No.

1179
01:09:58,748 --> 01:10:00,590
And crackers

1180
01:10:03,473 --> 01:10:05,115
And a chocolate.

1181
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:07,477
Several, actually.

1182
01:10:07,918 --> 01:10:09,399
Got any kids' candy?

1183
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:11,842
- What kind?
- Whatever.

1184
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:20,931
- Anything to eat?
- No.

1185
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:23,814
Yeah you do.
Give me something to eat.

1186
01:10:23,894 --> 01:10:26,256
You've come to your senses?

1187
01:10:26,337 --> 01:10:28,419
- Pates ok?
- Yeah.

1188
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:30,301
- Two.
- OK.

1189
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:32,583
Bread?

1190
01:10:36,187 --> 01:10:38,149
Did they come along
with my cables?

1191
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:39,390
No.

1192
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,592
- How much?
- It's OK.

1193
01:10:41,672 --> 01:10:44,635
- Tell me.
- It's OK, I tell you.

1194
01:10:46,998 --> 01:10:48,920
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

1195
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,774
I got you candy
for the kid.

1196
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:13,024
How much to Botosani?

1197
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:17,789
Seven hours or so.

1198
01:11:17,869 --> 01:11:20,432
How much, not how long.

1199
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,398
A hundred and something.

1200
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,682
But I got nothing.
He took everything.

1201
01:11:30,802 --> 01:11:32,724
All your stuff?

1202
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,328
Everything.

1203
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:42,174
My money, my bag,
my teddy bear.

1204
01:11:42,254 --> 01:11:44,576
Forget the teddy bear.

1205
01:11:52,785 --> 01:11:54,947
I'll give you a ride.

1206
01:11:57,349 --> 01:11:59,552
And I'll give you some money, too.

1207
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,283
We'll stop on the way
and get a teddy bear.

1208
01:12:16,649 --> 01:12:18,571
Thank you.

1209
01:12:24,457 --> 01:12:26,619
Take this, too.

1210
01:12:29,983 --> 01:12:34,227
Jeni, I'll talk to the guys.
They'll set him straight.

1211
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:36,790
Be safe! Well done.

1212
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:50,505
What can I get you?

1213
01:13:59,514 --> 01:14:02,357
I'd like...

1214
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:06,441
a candle.

1215
01:14:06,641 --> 01:14:08,844
I don't understand. What?

1216
01:14:08,964 --> 01:14:11,847
A candle...

1217
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:14,850
A candle?
Sorry. Haven't got any.

1218
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:19,334
Sorry. We had scented candles,
but they didn't sell well.

1219
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:22,017
- Jeez, Colonel!
- Yes.

1220
01:14:22,097 --> 01:14:24,339
- Sorry. I didn't recognize you.
- Yeah.

1221
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:27,463
You've lost a lot of weight.
Is the power down?

1222
01:14:27,543 --> 01:14:29,545
A candle...

1223
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,027
Sorry, I really haven't
got any.

1224
01:14:32,107 --> 01:14:34,069
How's Mrs. Antonia? OK?

1225
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:36,952
How are the dogs?

1226
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:40,756
- She's...
- Wait maybe I can help.

1227
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,329
Colonel...

1228
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:55,131
take this flashlight.

1229
01:14:55,251 --> 01:14:57,293
It's old... for free.

1230
01:14:57,413 --> 01:14:59,495
- No...
- No charge!

1231
01:14:59,615 --> 01:15:05,461
But she's... dead.

1232
01:15:05,662 --> 01:15:08,825
It's not dead. Press here.
See? It's on. See?

1233
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:11,828
It's working. You
can use it. Please.

1234
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:13,910
No. Candle.

1235
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,112
Haven't got any. Sorry.

1236
01:15:16,192 --> 01:15:18,955
You'll do with
the flashlight.

1237
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,120
Let me help you.

1238
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:31,128
Cheers, Colonel!

1239
01:15:35,692 --> 01:15:39,576
I'll get someone to look
at the electric board, OK?

1240
01:15:44,661 --> 01:15:48,145
Oh my God. She's dead!

1241
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:51,188
Fuck.

1242
01:16:30,909 --> 01:16:33,231
Colonel, I apologize.

1243
01:16:33,311 --> 01:16:35,874
I didn't understand.

1244
01:16:35,954 --> 01:16:39,597
I found these candles.
Take them.

1245
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:43,722
What can I say? My condolences.
God rest her soul.

1246
01:16:43,802 --> 01:16:46,725
And I apologize once again.

1247
01:16:58,216 --> 01:16:59,778
Man, it's a fucking
rattle-bag.

1248
01:16:59,898 --> 01:17:01,260
Where are you taking it?

1249
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,102
The non-stop here. Or they'll
steal it by tomorrow.

1250
01:17:04,183 --> 01:17:06,545
- Steal? This?
- They'll steal the engine.

1251
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:08,067
He can watch it.

1252
01:17:08,147 --> 01:17:10,990
- This deathtrap?
- Yeah, this deathtrap.

1253
01:17:13,552 --> 01:17:16,956
You were good, I must admit it.

1254
01:17:17,957 --> 01:17:19,718
- Take the cables.
- Yes boss!

1255
01:17:19,798 --> 01:17:21,080
You left me alone, you dirtbag.

1256
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,562
You did well, but I shat my pants
when you didn't take the money.

1257
01:17:23,642 --> 01:17:26,165
- Why?
- What if he called the police?

1258
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:30,209
He wanted to give me the lei,
but then I saw the Euros.

1259
01:17:30,329 --> 01:17:33,412
And the moron was drunk too.
And the insurance doesn't cover it.

1260
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:34,654
If you're drunk. Get it?

1261
01:17:34,774 --> 01:17:36,095
- Still, man.
- What?

1262
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:37,416
What if he called the police?

1263
01:17:37,537 --> 01:17:39,098
The money he's got could buy the
cops and the car on top of it.

1264
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:41,741
- The wedding ring, sucker.
- What?

1265
01:17:41,821 --> 01:17:44,023
He was married.
He wasn't going to call anyone.

1266
01:17:44,103 --> 01:17:46,426
Stop staring at me.
Give him the cables.

1267
01:17:46,506 --> 01:17:48,508
- You're smart.
- You can say that again.

1268
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:52,232
I got you the cables.

1269
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:55,755
Good. The man came for them
twice today. He was pretty upset.

1270
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:57,677
We'll work it out.

1271
01:17:57,997 --> 01:17:59,639
Give me the money.

1272
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:09,329
Here.

1273
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:12,492
Five hundred for me,
five hundred for you.

1274
01:18:12,612 --> 01:18:14,494
How do we split this?

1275
01:18:14,614 --> 01:18:17,377
- We'll exchange it tomorrow.
- I need it now.

1276
01:18:17,618 --> 01:18:19,059
- Where to exchange it?
- Here.

1277
01:18:19,179 --> 01:18:21,341
He hasn't got it.
Don't, man.

1278
01:18:21,421 --> 01:18:25,105
Sir, could you exchange five
hundred Euros for us?

1279
01:18:25,185 --> 01:18:26,867
Five hundred Euros?
What am I, Carrefour?

1280
01:18:26,947 --> 01:18:28,749
I don't make that kind
of money in a week.

1281
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,311
Wait. How much did
you owe me?

1282
01:18:32,513 --> 01:18:34,275
- Me?
- Yeah.

1283
01:18:35,756 --> 01:18:39,280
- Thirteen hundred.
- So. Five hundred?

1284
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,323
At a rate of four lei. We'll work out
the difference. Seven, then.

1285
01:18:42,403 --> 01:18:45,086
- What difference? What?
- Wait.

1286
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:47,648
Wait, we're getting
confused here.

1287
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:49,170
Four lei is too little.

1288
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:51,612
For how long you put
me off, it's OK.

1289
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,734
I'll exchange two hundred,
but not at a rate of four.

1290
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:54,856
Putting me off again?

1291
01:18:54,976 --> 01:18:56,818
No, and I'll give you
the rest afterwards.

1292
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:58,739
- Four two OK?
- Four two is OK.

1293
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,621
- I don't like it.
- It's OK.

1294
01:19:00,742 --> 01:19:02,904
- Let me see if I got the money.
- What are you talking about?

1295
01:19:02,984 --> 01:19:05,667
- It's none of your business, man.
- It's my money.

1296
01:19:06,748 --> 01:19:07,909
It comes out of my half.

1297
01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:12,113
- Where did you get the money?
- What's it to you?

1298
01:19:12,193 --> 01:19:13,675
They're fake!
Counterfeit!

1299
01:19:13,755 --> 01:19:15,517
Fake, how?
Are you stupid?

1300
01:19:15,597 --> 01:19:18,079
Come here. You
seem smarter.

1301
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,923
Look here. Do you see
any safety marks here?

1302
01:19:22,444 --> 01:19:24,926
This is printer-grade paper, man.

1303
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:28,970
Are you this fucking stupid?
Even my mama could tell.

1304
01:19:32,974 --> 01:19:35,857
Fucking shit!
What did you do?

1305
01:19:35,977 --> 01:19:38,260
What did you do?
Did you take counterfeit money?

1306
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:41,023
He was giving you lei.
Why didn't you take lei?

1307
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:43,946
You think you're smart?
Un-fucking-believable!

1308
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:45,587
My heart!

1309
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:48,390
What do I do now?
Fucking kill me already.

1310
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:50,352
How do I pay him tonight?
Fuck.

1311
01:19:50,432 --> 01:19:53,155
Here, eat these Euros.
You want Euros? Here!

1312
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:55,918
- Fuck.
- Hold it, man.

1313
01:19:56,639 --> 01:19:58,561
What are you doing?

1314
01:19:59,321 --> 01:20:00,482
Where are you going?

1315
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:02,364
I'm going to look for
a moron like you.

1316
01:20:02,444 --> 01:20:04,246
So you're leaving me with
the car all messed up?

1317
01:20:04,326 --> 01:20:06,449
Fucking moron!

1318
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:08,931
Where are you going
with the money?

1319
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:12,196
Where did you get the money?

1320
01:21:12,836 --> 01:21:14,958
It's a serious crime.

1321
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:23,407
Got money to go to Spain?

1322
01:21:23,487 --> 01:21:26,530
I got no money to give you,
much less go to Spain.

1323
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:29,974
It's OK. Have a beer.

1324
01:21:33,337 --> 01:21:34,979
Thanks.

1325
01:21:43,628 --> 01:21:46,110
Motherfucking life.

1326
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:49,073
Speaking of life.
Do you know Mr. Anton?

1327
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:51,796
The Colonel? Third floor?

1328
01:21:52,036 --> 01:21:54,679
No.
Does he need Euros?

1329
01:21:54,759 --> 01:21:57,642
He doesn't need anything.

1330
01:21:57,722 --> 01:22:01,566
You wouldn't know him, really.
He hasn't gone outside in years.

1331
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:07,532
You know his wife.
Mrs. Anton.

1332
01:22:07,772 --> 01:22:09,694
- No.
- You've got to.

1333
01:22:09,814 --> 01:22:12,737
The white-haired lady.
Seventy-ish.

1334
01:22:12,858 --> 01:22:15,100
- With the stray-dogs?
- That's the one.

1335
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:19,104
- What about her?
- Nothing. She died.
