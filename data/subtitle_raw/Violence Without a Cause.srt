3
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,251
How about going now?

4
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:12,811
But where should we go?

5
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,976
We have no place else to go,
other than our studio flat.

6
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:20,996
We're fortunate to at least have
a studio flat to live in.

7
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:27,150
It isn't good.
I'd prefer a luxury flat.

8
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:33,641
I don't want to live in a cheap, narrow
flat. It's no use but to sleep in.

9
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:36,425
A flat is a place to sleep in.
That's sufficient.

10
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:38,874
Even if three men live together?

11
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,187
Matsumoto, are you tired
of living together?

12
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,840
No. Only he wants to do 'it'.

13
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,419
- To do what?
- To do 'it' with a woman.

14
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,021
You can do 'it'.

15
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:52,193
A woman won't come
in a small, dirty room.

16
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,031
Be clever, Harada!

17
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:57,693
If you're clever, you can do
anything with a woman.

18
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:03,292
"My father rents a luxury flat for me.
Come with me!

19
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:08,491
"How about sipping brandy, and listening
to the Beethoven's 9th symphony?"

20
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:13,291
Say such things and bring her to
the room! Then you can do as you please.

21
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:15,199
You're talking about a dream.

22
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:18,245
A dream is arbitrary,
but reality is inflexible.

23
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:24,790
You've watched pink films too much.
Reality is not as easy as in pinks.

24
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,146
We've not been able to do anything, since we
rented this flat more than a year ago.

25
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,931
I don't know what to do any more.

26
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,111
I want money.

<i>Shinjuku Station</i>

28
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,975
Matsumoto, it would be fine if trains
were always empty like this.

29
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:11,180
Of course! Isn't that right, Matsumoto?

30
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:14,097
We're deplorable.

31
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:18,591
We'll get better surely, Matsumoto?
We're still young...

32
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,947
- We're only 19 years old.
- What's the use?

33
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,601
Nothing...

34
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,981
Hey! We've arrived.

35
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,756
Hey!

36
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:27,127
What's the matter? You won'tget off?
Won't you return to our flat?

37
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,293
- Where do you want to go?
- Somewhere far away.

38
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,445
Me too.

39
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:34,923
It's the same thing everywhere.
Nothing changes.

40
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,357
- That's why I'll go.
- Don't joke, Matsumoto!

41
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,352
Do you have the money
to go far away?

42
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:50,005
- I have only this.
- Only that?

43
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:53,313
Then show me your money!

44
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,214
I've paid more than
five hundred yen for you.

45
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:04,679
- It's rare for Harada, not like usual.
- It might snow.

46
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:12,254
Harada, isn't this sufficient?

47
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,419
Wow! How did you get such an amount?

48
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:20,351
This isn't money from a dubious source.
A registered mail arrived yesterday.

49
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,889
Your father has sent you
thirty thousand yen?

50
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:28,365
This month, much more than usual.
He may have got more in the lottery.

51
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:31,425
They send me no more than
twenty thousand yen.

52
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:35,554
Don't complain! I live by myself.

53
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:40,658
- It's natural, as you work.
- I don't work spontaneously.

54
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,798
Where on earth do you want to go?

55
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:29,362
"Far away, it's the Sea of Okhotsk,

56
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:37,642
"a red, bright red Japanese rose is

00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:43,107
"looking at the sea and crying.

58
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:50,092
"The name of the place is
the Abashiri prison."

59
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,427
Without joking, where will we go?

60
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:57,520
- To Abashiri.
- Impossible!

61
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,620
It's cold.

62
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,677
Osawa, don't you have to
go to the factory?

63
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:50,979
It's OK.

64
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:57,150
It's strange. I'm angry
when I'm in the crowds of Tokyo,

65
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,445
as well as when I'm looking at
the sea, out of season, alone with you.

66
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,417
Harada, I'm tired of hearing
insignificant things you repeat.

67
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,820
- What? Don't speak as if you
were important! - Stop, Harada!

68
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:12,667
Don't do anything that makes me hungrier!
I'm already very hungry.

69
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,333
A lie! You neve rfight seriously.

70
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,901
- You're a coward.
- You no less than me!

71
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:21,857
You can't blame the others.
Because we're the same species.

72
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,712
- Let's go!
- Damn!

73
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:59,768
- Hey! They look like a couple.
- You're right - perhaps newly-weds.

74
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:05,804
They may be on their honeymoon,
and staying in a hotel near here.

75
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:08,532
Damn! They're doing well.

76
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:16,383
If so, last night should have been
their first night. They're doing well.

77
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:18,547
We alone have nothing good.

78
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:21,130
There's an enormous difference
between us.

79
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:25,799
A popular man can do 'it' with many girls,
whereas an unfortunate one gets nobody.

80
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:29,806
"Ah! No! Stop! Forgive me!"

81
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:34,263
Stupid! No girl says that
on the first night nowadays.

82
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:40,553
"What? You can't go any longer?
I must worry about our future.

83
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,974
"My body is on fire like this!
I don't like weak men."

84
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:50,161
Congratulations! We award this week's
prize to Akiko Matsumoto.

85
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,207
Congratulations! We'll give you
ten dozen condoms and

86
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:58,209
a hundred thousand tissue papers!

87
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:06,732
- Look! The girl is fairly nice.
- The man is affected and foppish.

88
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:11,126
- I wish that glamorous girl would
let me do 'it'. - Impossible!

89
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:14,793
If she won't, we have no choice
other than to do our own will.

90
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,914
No!

91
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:23,698
Set me free!

92
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:28,255
<i>Don't enter the erosion control forest!</i>

93
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:43,115
Stop it!

94
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:45,528
Shut up!

95
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,773
Please! Stop it!

96
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,450
Stop it! Please!

97
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,612
Ouch!

98
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,529
Stop!

99
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,232
Hey! This man seems to be
a salesman of Towa Firm.

100
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:15,084
Really? That's a prominent company.

101
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,920
If I enter a university,
I'll never geta job with them.

102
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:23,545
He's a lucky man. We're all the second
or third sons of poor farmers.

103
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:28,329
We're unnecessary. We were born
because our fathers saved a condom.

104
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:33,162
- But I've had to make a lot of effort.
- You want to preach to us about life?

105
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,514
I didn't mean that.

106
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:40,137
Effort? Don't make fools of us!
Effort is useful in what way?

107
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,228
If we make an effort,
who will benefit from that?

108
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:47,378
The world is structured so that
we can't get women, nor money!

109
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,661
I can't be patient any more.
I'll do 'it'!

110
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,536
Finish quickly!

111
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:43,588
- You do 'it' too.
- Do 'it'! Don't be ashamed!

112
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,469
- Our relationship isn't like that!
- What kind is it then?

113
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,268
Is yours a platonic one?

114
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:52,255
Ah, platonic. If so, you'd better do 'it'.

115
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,052
Now do 'it'!

116
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:59,829
From the medical point of view,
you should eject what needs ejecting.

117
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,990
You'll feel more agreeable.

118
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,364
Don't hesitate!

119
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,324
Do it at once!

120
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,311
Do 'it'! Don't be an idiot!

121
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,068
Harada, take photos of them
with this camera,

122
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:24,201
when they are excited and naked.

123
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:30,075
Take off your clothes! Don't be an idiot!

124
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,240
Do it with eagerness!

125
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,892
You must do it with eagerness.

126
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:47,193
Good!

127
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:51,900
More!

128
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:23,835
- Osawa, you did your best.
- She has excellent breasts.

129
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:37,801
- That guy won't try to prosecute us?
- He won't, because we have these negatives.

130
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,200
Excuse me!

131
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,406
- Who can that be?
- Hide them!

132
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,608
- Who is it?
- I'm a bill collector for the newspaper.

133
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,993
Wait a moment, please!

134
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,068
- Give me some money!
- I only have this.

135
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,851
OK. That's sufficient.

136
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:09,723
Hello!
Thank you.

137
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,655
Money only goes away from us.

138
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,997
How about stopping the newspaper?
Events in the world have nothing to do with us.

139
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:27,465
- You're right.
- I want a woman, rather than newspapers.

140
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:31,558
Oh! They've done well.

141
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:36,567
They confined two female university
students in cars, and violated them?

142
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:45,397
"At around 1am, December the 15th, two cars
approached A, 19 years old, and B, 18 years old,

143
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:50,946
"walking in a street of Harajuku, and
forced them into their respective cars.

144
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:55,663
"The two cars went from Shinjuku,
via the Ome route, into a forest.

145
00:19:55,808 --> 00:20:02,623
"Then the six men in the two cars
suddenly rushed upon A and B,

146
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:06,180
"carried them out of the cars,
took them behind some trees,

147
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,593
"and started tearing off their clothes.

148
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:14,512
"The female students resisted violently
saying, 'No! Please don't! Stop! '

149
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:19,389
"But the men threatened them saying,
'Be quiet! Or you'll get beaten, whores.'

150
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:24,048
"Faced with the violent strength of the
men's arms, their resistance was in vain.

151
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:28,037
"Buttons from their blouses were thrown
away, their skirt fasteners pulled down.

152
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:32,587
"Their white bodies that had never
known men, bounced in the dark!"

153
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:36,802
Osawa, didn't you add something
you'd imagined?

154
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,095
Don't joke! I'm only citing
what is written here.

155
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:55,017
- I don't want to go to the university.
- Why?

156
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,307
If you wan tto know the reason,
come to the university!

157
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,448
Please.

158
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:21,079
- Can I discuss this with you a little? OK?
- OK.

159
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:23,873
- Your department?
- I haven't entered yet.

160
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:27,033
Oh? But you're interested in
the student movements?

<i>Dialogue in a period of reformations</i>

Now campus disputes escalate
with historical universality worldwide.

163
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,581
This fact proves clearly that
the bourgeois democracy, in the name

167
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,517
"the way in which universities are controlled
by the power of the State.

168
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:56,926
"In this way, we must fight thoroughly
against the capitalism of Japanese

169
00:21:57,062 --> 00:22:00,964
"imperialism, that's revealing the essence
of monopolised national capitalism."

170
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:05,382
These are boring phrases
which are intended to threaten us!

171
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:08,223
What are you saying?
You lack comprehension.

172
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:13,164
- The strategy of the State is obvious.
- I've understood you. Stop, please!

173
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,362
- What have you understood? Nothing!
- Don't say pretentious things.

174
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:22,238
What we need is a woman.
Do you understand? Let's go!

175
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,977
She's a nice girl.
She doesn't need to distribute leaflets.

176
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:33,098
She's probably doing it for the memory.
She'll marry a man with a bright future,

177
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:36,486
they'll make a healthy home together,
and she'll bear two children or so.

178
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:40,390
- When they've grown up...
- She'll say, "When I was a student,

179
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:45,203
"campus disputes took place everywhere,
and I also participated in them.

180
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:48,867
"I was like Rosa Luxemburg
or Joan of Arc.

181
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:52,836
"I recall that vivid and
passionate time," and so forth.

182
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:56,838
Nowadays, for the girls
the revolution is a kind of romance.

183
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,287
Kazukoin 'The Setting Sun' of Dazai,

184
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:02,766
also says, "I was born for
love and revolution."

185
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:10,116
- What are you doing? - What are you
thinking of, distributing leaflets?

186
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:11,532
What do you want to say?

187
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:14,662
- How about going to bed with me?
- I'm not a whore!

188
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,948
- A whore? You're worse than a whore.
- Don't disturb me!

189
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:23,077
You understand nothing.
In a word, you're sexually frustrated.

190
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,881
That's not true, because this job
is very satisfying.

191
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:32,150
Job? A joke! This is a pastime. You
receive money abundantly from your home.

192
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,509
That's why you're able to do such a thing!

193
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:29,501
It's cold.

194
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:34,889
I want money.

195
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:37,794
Do you have any cigarettes?

196
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:24,130
"Even flowers that were wished
by the spring mustfall.

197
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:33,120
"Drink after drink, I drink all day long.

198
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:48,466
"Anyway, the name of my last destination
is the Abashiri prison."

199
00:25:55,634 --> 00:26:00,162
It's late at night -
don't sing such an odd song, please!

200
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:03,829
- Pardon. - Be conscious of your
neighbours! We can't sleep!

201
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:05,708
I'm really sorry.

202
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:09,154
<i>A comet twinkled briefly.</i>

203
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:16,951
<i>My burning body is at the northernmost end.</i>

204
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:26,185
Bastard! In fact they can't get excited,
hearing that record while doing 'it'.

205
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:29,917
That song isn't suitable
as background music.

206
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,714
- Hey! Let's peep.
- OK.

207
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:41,144
Me first.

208
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,309
Can you see?

209
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:07,457
Unbelievable!

210
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:12,577
- Change places!
- Shut up! They've just started.

211
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:14,779
Change places!

212
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,498
Amazing!

213
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:25,098
That's enough for you.

214
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,403
- What can you see?
- They're doing!

215
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,628
Bes ilent!

216
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,848
- Amazing!
- Damn!

217
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:41,422
- Change!
- What are you doing?

218
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:54,895
Move away!

219
00:27:56,388 --> 00:28:00,734
Wait a moment! He's putting it in.

220
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:17,517
Hey! That's enough for you.
Let me see a little!

221
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:22,356
Wait a moment! Shut up!

222
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:25,646
- Let me see a little!
- Now it's a good scene.

223
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:30,078
Move away so that I can see.

224
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,387
Hey! Quick!

225
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:42,575
Amazing!

226
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:47,062
- Let me see a little! I want to see.
- Wait a moment!

227
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,221
Enough for you. Change! Ouch!

228
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,746
Superb!

229
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:11,292
- Enough for you.
- It's a good scene. Ouch!

230
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:15,614
Unbelievable!

231
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,934
- Unbelievable!
- Uh-oh!

232
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,912
Unbelievable!

233
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:31,621
- It's clearly visible?
- I can't see.

234
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,694
Hey! Move away a little!

235
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:44,996
Hey!

236
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:46,844
Hey!

237
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,338
- Don't push me!
- Ouch!

238
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,121
This is amazing!

239
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:59,607
Amazing!!!

240
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:04,409
- Enough for you.
- Wait! Wait a moment!

241
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,696
Good! Good!

242
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:10,652
Super good!

243
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:12,768
- Let me do 'it'!
- Stop!

244
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:15,422
- I want to do 'it'.
- Shutup!

245
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:20,585
They're going to finish.

246
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:27,114
Damn it! Hey!

247
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,896
Unbelievable!

248
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,282
- Look!
- Invisible behind a board.

249
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,763
- What's going on?
- They're doing well.

250
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:02,594
I also want to do 'it'. Damn!

251
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:09,135
- Shut up!
- Let me see!

252
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:36,817
You can look.

253
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:39,801
Damn!

254
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:43,920
We're always only looking.

255
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,977
I've also become eager to do 'it'.

256
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:18,899
Damn!

257
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:47,621
- Harada, can I put up these photos?
- Do as you please.

258
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:49,974
She's so glamorous, isn't she?

259
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:52,868
Yes. I want to do it
with such a girl forever.

260
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:08,452
- When we're free, we always watch pink films.
- With our money, there's nowhere else to go.

261
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,928
If we get excited by films,
we have nobody who will let us do 'it'.

262
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:20,467
- How about raping by turns again?
- We shall probably try that way.

263
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:30,858
- It's unlocked.
- You may have forgotten.

264
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,632
How are you?
I haven't seen you for a long time.

265
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,932
- Do you know her?
- Er...

266
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:52,510
- I've seen her somewhere.
- Somewhere? Don't you meet her regularly?

267
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:55,135
Don't joke! I don't know her.

268
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,684
You're all talking nonsense.
You should all know me.

269
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:04,576
You happen to be Chieko, one of our
classmates at the primary school?

270
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:10,842
Yes. I'm Chieko Yoshinaga. I asked
the caretaker and came in. Sorry.

271
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:14,224
We couldn't tell because
you've changed so much.

272
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,574
- You've become very beautiful!
- I've changed so much?

273
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:20,887
It's been seven or eight years since then.
Who told you this address?

274
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:24,304
- I heard it from Sato.
- Sit down.

275
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:31,788
- Chieko, do you live in Tokyo?
- Yes. I rent a luxury flat in Akasaka.

276
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,421
- You heard? She lives in a luxury flat!
- What do you live on?

277
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:39,637
- I work as a hostess at a nightclub
in Ginza. - Ginza?

278
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,641
A hostess at a nightclub?

279
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,962
I can never go to such a place.

280
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:48,196
- What are you doing now?
- I'm a student.

281
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:51,509
- You go to a university?
- Yes, like that.

282
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:56,042
- You were good at studying at
the primary school. - I wasn't that good.

283
00:34:56,341 --> 00:35:00,072
- Matsumoto?
- I don't do anything.

284
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:05,318
- Nothing? You don't work?
- He's preparing for entrance exams.

285
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,686
- So, you go to a preparatory school?
- Yes...

286
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:16,340
You don't look so good.
Don't regret a failure!

287
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:19,375
Your cigarette is back-to-front.

288
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:25,916
- Osawa, where are you going?
- The toilet.

289
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:34,344
- What does he do?
- He's a factory worker.

290
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,572
He was good at engineering.

291
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:41,481
He works in a small factory, but
he feels comfortable, as he likes engineering.

292
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:46,191
- Matsumoto, give me a cigarette!
- This cheap one is oK?

293
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:50,158
Are you feeling inferior?
I don't like mean spiritedness.

294
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:04,275
- Osawa, do you like your work?
- I don't like it all that much.

295
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,593
Wha ttime is it now?

296
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:09,593
It's five minutes to one.

297
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:11,521
It's so late! I'll go back home now!

298
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:15,073
- You can stay here.
- Idiot! We aren't children anymore.

299
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,490
Write your address here.

300
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:41,375
You live in a fine place!

301
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:45,302
- I'll leave now.
- I'll accompany you to the station.

302
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,692
Really? You're kind, Harada.

303
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:53,721
- Bye.
- I'll be back soon.

304
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:11,194
"Really? You're kind, Harada."
Damn it!

305
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,759
Hey! Let's sleep now.

306
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:34,285
<i>Preparatory school</i>

307
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:16,304
- Hey! Matsumoto. You play well?
- We think about the same thing.

308
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:21,182
Don't you have to study? Examinations
will be taking place within a month.

309
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,740
- It's none of your business.
- How about going for a drink?

310
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:10,982
Oh! What's the matter?

311
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:14,653
You shouldn't be surprised.
We came here as customers.

312
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,822
We won't drink for free.

313
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:47,049
- You made love with Harada that night?
- I don't know. What do you want me to say?

314
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,999
He left with you and didn't return home.

315
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:52,145
Do you mean he stayed in my room?

316
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,646
- Yes.
- That's why a rustic is irritating!

317
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,263
- A single cell!
- What? - Stop!

318
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:01,990
Since you slept with him,
you'll sleep with us. OK?

319
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:06,081
Don't joke! Do you want to imply
I'll sleep with anyone?

320
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:09,458
It isn't fair that you let him do it,
but not us!

321
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:11,478
That's my own business!

322
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:15,337
For three notes or for five?

323
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,739
Don't take me for a whore!

324
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:22,475
OK. You're worse than a whore. A whore
lets a man do it for money, but you won't.

325
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,509
You're completely selfish.
You don't have the slightest bit of kindness.

326
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:47,616
- It was dangerous.
- Idiot! I'm a veteran.

327
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:50,236
You've stolen three books.
You've done well.

328
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:53,839
850 yen, 730 yen and 550 yen.

329
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:56,419
These amount to 2130 yen.

330
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,315
Take them to a new store,
in case you're suspected!

331
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,050
They'll pay 1000 yen.

332
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,753
How about picking up a girl today?

333
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:07,046
We won't succeed this time either.

334
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:09,592
Hey! How about a cup of tea with us?

335
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:16,881
Come chat with us. All right?

336
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,239
- How about a cup of tea?
- Only for a while?

337
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:27,763
Next time!

338
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:36,461
- A cup of tea with us?
- Disgusting!

339
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:51,279
We live for nothing.

340
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:54,549
Nothing is interesting.

341
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,894
- How about raping Chieko between us?
- Chieko?

342
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:02,391
- Are you serious?
- What an expression you pull!

343
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,653
She isn't just a friend from long ago
anymore.

344
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:11,024
- Harada, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
- What are you talking about, all of a suddden?

345
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:15,360
- Because you didn't return that night.
- You suspected me?

346
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,320
- Yes.
- It's only natural.

347
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:22,389
Then I was thinking of
having her to myself.

348
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:24,183
As we suspected.

349
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:27,300
- Then?
- You didn't do 'it' eventually?

350
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:32,985
No. We arrived at the block of flats in
Akasaka, and she asked me to return home.

351
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:35,878
You should have got angry.

352
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:38,175
I got angry down to my balls!

353
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:45,333
To have me accompany her to the block of flats
and, then to reject me - is this allowed?

354
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:49,266
That's obviously a way
of making a fool of you.

355
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:54,218
- To tell the truth, we also went to...
- To the block of flats?

356
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:59,096
- No, but to the nightclub.
- And there we were refused by her.

357
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,696
Who is it?

358
00:45:47,825 --> 00:45:51,033
- An employee of the cleaning shop.
- Wait a moment!

359
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:56,619
What are you doing?

360
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:00,491
Set me free! You've gone mad?!

361
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,299
We aren't insane!

362
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:09,397
- Set me free!
- I can't forgive a woman like you!

363
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:17,162
You'll sleep with rich people, but not
with us! Don't make fools of us!

364
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,018
- Wait, Harada! Let's decide our turns!
- You're right.

365
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:51,430
- Beasts!
- Who has made us beasts?

366
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:53,512
Who has made us beasts?

367
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:55,901
Beast!

368
00:47:56,787 --> 00:48:00,541
- Beast!
- Women like you have made us beasts!

369
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:04,817
You're haughty, despite your dirty
mind and body! I dislike that!

370
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,811
Always the same supper.

371
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:14,678
I like to eat bloody
beef steak sometimes.

372
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:16,705
There are people who eat it everyday.

373
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,411
If we spend money on delicious food,
we can't play.

374
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:22,159
If we spend it on play,
we have toe at bad meals.

375
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:25,680
- The world is short of money.
- We'v played a lo trecently.

376
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:30,594
- But only pachinko and films.
- Those don't count as 'playing'.

377
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:33,929
In summer, we worked part-time and
didn't go to the sea or to the mountains.

378
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:37,152
- Without a car, nor a luxury flat.
- Without fine clothes.

379
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:39,046
We aren't popular with women.

380
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,877
- How about returning?
- Where to?

381
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:44,035
- To Aomori.
- What would we do there?

382
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:48,390
- But in Tokyo, there is nothing good.
- In Aonmori, it's similar.

383
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:59,858
What are you doing? Eat!

384
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,553
How about doing something with this?

385
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,781
A toy pistol. You mean
robbing a bank?

386
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:11,042
Stupid! This was converted
from a cap pistol.

387
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:13,755
I modified the firing pin
during my nightshift.

388
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:16,568
- That fires bullets?
- Of course!

389
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:20,408
But you can't become
happy with a pistol.

390
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:23,449
I don't have it in order
to become happy.

391
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:50,942
- Hey! I expected you were here.
- Hi, Matsumoto!

392
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:52,975
You've been to the school today?

393
00:49:53,137 --> 00:49:56,834
Yes. I must sometimes go there,
as the exams approach.

394
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:28,931
- We've seen that woman somewhere before?
- Yes, I've seen her somewhere...

395
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,623
I wonder where?

396
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:35,278
That's her! She's the woman
in the nude photos in our room.

397
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:37,266
You're right.

398
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:41,961
Osawa, she's the woman in the photos
cut out of your magazine?

399
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:34,450
As you identified her first,
you ought to call on her.

400
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:38,632
- That's a cunning thing to say.
- Let's decide by playing for it.

401
00:51:41,278 --> 00:51:42,711
Damn!

402
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:53,049
Who is it?

403
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:59,023
- What do you want?
- Nothing. How to say...

404
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,904
We...

405
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:04,521
- know you.
- A model?

406
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:09,241
- I do things like that.
- We have your photos.

407
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:13,736
- You're glamorous.
- You're referring to those nude photos?

408
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:19,278
- Yes. Those nude photos.
- You're a funny man.

409
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,720
- We live near here.
- Really?

410
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:28,730
- For a long time?
- Yes. For more than a year.

411
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:31,738
Then you've lived here longer than me.

412
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:36,517
- When did you move here?
- About three months ago.

413
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,686
Just recently!

414
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:42,795
It looks as if you were
investigating me.

415
00:52:43,807 --> 00:52:46,537
If you're free, come in! OK?

416
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:56,917
This flat is much cosier than ours.

417
00:52:57,588 --> 00:52:59,954
- Do you live in a studio flat?
- Yes.

418
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,333
- We live together in a small room.
- So we always make a mess.

419
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:08,364
- Where are you from?
- We're all from Aomori.

420
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:14,144
- A coincidence! I'm also from Aomori.
- Sister... No. You're from Aomori, too?

421
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:17,887
- Do you want some whisky?
- Good!

422
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:39,344
Thank you.

423
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:44,462
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

424
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,005
I want to go shopping.
Could you take care of my flat for me?

425
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:55,634
- All right.
- Thank you.

426
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:08,244
- I can't stay calm.
- No woman has ever been so kind to us.

427
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,948
She's our angel, Santa-Maria.

428
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:16,546
- Perhaps she'll sleep with us?
- It's certain.

429
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,103
She's a woman who lets men do 'that', surely.
Her lascivious eyes tell me that.

430
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:25,826
My dreams and hopes have always been
betrayed. I cannot believe in anyone.

431
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:32,949
Hey! She seems to be back.

432
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,601
I'm sorry. I've made you wait a long time.

433
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:40,758
We must apologise.
We've stayed sat here for ages.

434
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,997
Be at ease, because I can't
offer you a meal.

435
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:50,063
- I'm not okay today. Can I sleep a bit?
- We'll go now.

436
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:54,701
- You can stay and drink.
- Thank you.

437
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:47,111
- Hey! She's provoking us.
- "If invited, a man mustn't refuse a woman."

438
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:50,204
- I will do 'it'.
- Me too. - And me.

439
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:03,175
We...

440
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:07,703
What?

441
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:12,010
We want to be... in bed with you.

442
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:23,629
- You've never been in bed with a woman?
- No!

443
00:56:24,561 --> 00:56:29,919
- All right.
- Wait. Let's decide by playing for it first!

444
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:36,332
I'll go first.

445
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,840
- Damn!
- Damn!

446
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:28,991
Have you finished?

447
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,421
- Osawa?
- OK.

448
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:13,958
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

449
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:20,435
Be quiet! Or you'll get a beating.

450
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:24,360
We aren't in the wrong. She invited us.

451
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:29,342
Don't try to justify yourself, after you made
love with another man's woman! Bastard!

452
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:31,441
Bastard!

453
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:34,381
Bastard!

454
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:42,386
Fortunately, we only had one thousand
yen, but they took my watch.

455
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:46,760
You're still lucky, since you got to do 'it'
with her. But what should we do?

456
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:52,671
Damn! I didn't expect my dream
would be broken in this way.

457
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:28,679
Damn it!

458
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,587
Is this our angel?

459
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:44,564
Some Santa-Maria!

460
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,297
- Osawa, where are you going?
- I cannot help drinking.

461
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,014
- Osawa!
- Let him go!

462
01:00:06,149 --> 01:00:10,529
- He left with his pistol.
- Don't worry. Hew on't do anything.

463
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:19,774
- Matsumoto, you got balls?
- No, not at all.

464
01:00:46,823 --> 01:00:51,954
- He hasn't been back in three days.
- Where is he wandering about?

465
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:56,782
- Does he have any other place to go to?
- He seems to have no such acquaintances.

466
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,392
- Perhaps he's begging?
- Or maybe he does a day-labour job in Sanya?

467
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:03,552
- He might be dead?
- Don't say such a thing!

468
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:15,744
- An accidental firing of his pistol.
- He's an unfortunate guy.

469
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:21,414
- Killed by a pistol he'd made himself.
- Why did he go away with his pistol?

470
01:01:21,524 --> 01:01:22,741
I don'tknow.

471
01:01:23,426 --> 01:01:28,113
- Did he want to kill the nude model who
had deceived us? - It's possible.

472
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:31,883
The dead never speak.
We cannot know why.

473
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:36,877
On the cold concrete in Shinjuku,
not yet lit by the sun,

474
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:41,473
he was found dead, face down,
like a stretched-out frog.

475
01:01:44,147 --> 01:01:48,789
Our future isn't much different
from Osawa's. I can see it.

476
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:52,566
- I won't die. I won't die.
- He didn't die.

477
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:53,735
What?

478
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:56,485
- He didn't die.
- Then, what?

479
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,108
- He was killed.
- Killed?

480
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,690
- By who? By who was he killed?
- By everybody.

481
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:08,558
By Chieko, haughty though an old friend,

482
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:11,921
by the nude model who deceived us,

483
01:02:12,742 --> 01:02:15,722
by the caretaker here who complains,
if we're a little bit  noisy,

484
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:18,116
by the teachers at the junior high school,

485
01:02:18,882 --> 01:02:24,320
by the policemen who brought us to a police
station to investigate us, though innocent,

486
01:02:25,388 --> 01:02:29,825
and by all those who, instead of being
punished, live proudly, he was killed!

487
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:31,956
He was beaten to death!

488
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:08,502
- Hello! You're Harada?
- Yes.

489
01:03:08,631 --> 01:03:12,351
- Matsumoto, your mate, killed himself.
- Killed himself?

490
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,557
At 11am, he killed himself by leaping from
a platform at Shinjuku station.

491
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:22,292
We want to hear about him from you.
Come with me to the police station, please.

492
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:26,542
Can I ask him about the cause of
Matsumoto's suicide? - OK.

493
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:30,502
He was to sit the entrance
exams this year?

494
01:03:30,653 --> 01:03:32,359
Yes. I think so.

495
01:03:33,323 --> 01:03:36,542
Did he look like he was suffering from
neurosis caused by the exams?

496
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:38,934
Well, he didn't study hard...

497
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:44,489
Osawa, killed a week ago in an accident
with a pistol, was his roommate...

498
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:47,627
- Was he shocked by that?
- I think so.

499
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:52,385
- Had his attitude changed recently?
- I hadn't noticed anything.

500
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:56,559
For example, did he say that
he'd grown weary of living?

501
01:03:56,846 --> 01:03:58,689
Such things he always said.

502
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:01,893
- Was he worried about a woman?
- I don't believe he was.

503
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:04,379
We cannot determine a decisive cause.

504
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:11,057
Not because of neurosis caused by the exams,
nor because of despair about life.

505
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:14,893
Can we say 'a solitary man
in a megalopolis?'

506
01:04:15,165 --> 01:04:17,975
How about writing 'The suicide of
a young man who has lost

507
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:20,945
sight of how to live in the
developed, industrial, capitalist world?'

508
01:04:21,404 --> 01:04:22,905
That isn't true!

509
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:26,063
He didn't kill himself.
He was killed!

510
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:27,733
Absurd!

511
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:30,153
Shut up! Who kills himself willingly?

512
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:32,907
He was killed.
He'd no reason to kill himself!

513
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:42,363
Osawa, Matsumoto.

514
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,123
I'll play the record with
your favourite song on it.

515
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:22,373
<i>Even flowers that were wished</i>
<i>by the spring must fall.</i>

516
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:31,304
<i>Drink after drink, I drink all day long.</i>

517
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:46,741
<i>The name of my last destination is</i>
<i>the Abashiri prison.</i>

518
01:05:56,165 --> 01:06:08,305
<i>A comet twinkled briefly.</i>

519
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:17,342
<i>My burning body is at the northernmost end.</i>

520
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:24,343
<i>My name is such, my first name is such.</i>

521
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:33,015
<i>The name of the place is</i>
<i>the Abashiri prison.</i>

522
01:06:53,856 --> 01:07:06,235
<i>Far away, it's the Sea of Okhotsk.</i>

523
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:15,107
<i>A red, bright red Japanese rose is</i>

524
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,813
<i>looking at the sea and crying...</i>

525
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:26,877
This time, I really have nowhere
to return to any more.

526
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,846
Throw away the pistol!

527
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:57,459
Throw it away! Or I'll shoot!

528
01:08:58,247 --> 01:08:59,748
Throw it away!

529
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:04,902
I'll shoot!
