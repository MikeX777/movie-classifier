Amir,
leave all this and get the van.

00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:09,487
We'll wait at the road.

Thanks man.

<i>The refinery at

10
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:22,387
<i>- as a result of the terrible

11
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:31,219
<i>In some areas of Khuzestan, the
</i>flood waters have drowned the t.

12
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:38,218
<i>Twenty villages near Shadegan a.
</i>Three have been evacuated.

<i>The camps are reportedly
</i>handing out care packages,

14
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,175
<i>but they are in dire need
</i>of many staples and items.

15
00:04:55,341 --> 00:05:00,757
Is this a flood or a monster?!
It has devoured everything!

16
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:09,673
- Did you reach Mitra?
- I'm trying, but the lines are.

17
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:13,006
<i>If she doesn't answer,</i>

18
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,381
<i>let's go straight to Tehran.</i>

19
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:18,755
Amir! If the dam bursts...

20
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:23,380
We can sail from the
Karkheh river to the Rhine, bro!

21
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:26,713
We'll earn Euros and spend Toma!

22
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:28,754
Shut up!

23
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:32,920
Imagine you're floating.

24
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:10,040
<i>No worries! We'll pass the floo,
</i>and drive straight to Tehran.

25
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:15,790
We'll rock that stage my love!

26
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:18,707
We'll finish first! Trust me!

27
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:23,789
We'll be on our way to
The Pages of History!

<i>The Pages of History!</i>

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,621
Even though all their possessio,
home and hostel were lost in th,

30
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:37,537
Lady Mahla and her "Bandar Band"

31
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:41,787
made it just in time to Cafe Ste
for an exhilarating performance!

32
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:45,828
It was from this very stage that
they went on to world fame-

33
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:49,244
and found audiences in Paris,
Berlin, New York, Bangladesh-

34
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:51,035
and Amsterdam.

35
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,993
Let's listen to
a folk song by this band.

36
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:37,280
The road is closed up ahead.

37
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:40,862
I think we should turn around.

38
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,485
Hello.
Where does this road go to?

39
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:00,901
North of Hamidieh.

40
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:02,860
- So there’s a way.
- Where do you want to go?

41
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,776
We want to go to Tehran.

42
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,484
- Tehran?!
- Yes.

43
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:09,192
This is not an actual road.
It’s a jungle. You will be stuc.

44
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:46,187
- Your tablet is ringing.
- Navid, get the tablet.

45
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:49,854
Navid, get off your lazy ass
and get that tablet.

46
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:03,310
- It's Ms. Khoshdel.
- Give it here.

47
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:05,435
Pull over.

48
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:11,685
- Hello Ms. Khoshdel.
-<i> Hello, Mahla dear. Are you in?</i>

49
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:14,809
- We'll be there soon.
-<i> You're not here yet?</i>

50
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,058
<i>You have to be here by 6pm.</i>

51
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,891
-<i> The show starts at six.
</i>- We'll be there.

52
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,225
You won't believe what's happen.

53
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:25,432
Our home is flooded.
The roads are closed.

54
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:30,266
Everything's messed up.
There's water everywhere.

55
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:34,306
But we're coming
as fast as we can.

56
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:37,473
<i>Okay, dear. Just be on time.</i>

57
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,805
<i>Try to get here early.</i>

58
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:43,305
- We'll be there.
- Let me have it.

59
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:46,389
Hello, good day to you.

60
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:55,554
Is there a way you can send vids
of the performers we're up agai?

61
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,137
<i>I'll send you their links.
</i>Just don't be late!

62
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:02,262
Thank you so much.

63
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:03,678
See you.

64
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:06,636
- Goodbye, Ms. Khoshdel.
-<i> I love you all.</i>

65
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,844
Bye-bye!

66
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:13,593
You're such an idiot!
Links?

67
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:16,843
- To see our competition.
- When will we get there?

68
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,343
- We'll get there.
- We better not be late.

69
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:22,259
Don't stress over it.
We'll get there.

70
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,092
And inshallah you'll get 1st pl.

- Everyone is waiting to hear y.
-<i> Definitely 1st place!</i>

72
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:33,091
She'll rock the show,
my sweetness!

73
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,382
<i>Mommy Mahla...
</i>"My sweet-heart, my cutie-pie"

74
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,084
Next!

75
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:40,082
- She's too traditional!
- Who cares?! It's about how yo.

76
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:45,832
What we have is fresh.

77
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:50,373
Have a little confidence.
Don't worry.

78
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:52,540
Yeah, I sing better than her.

79
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:57,205
Hold your horses!
We're all equally great.

80
00:11:57,247 --> 00:12:00,621
You're great, and I know it.
But she is also great.

81
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,330
You need to be confident.

82
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:05,745
Go to the next one.

83
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:11,953
<i>Let me see her.</i>

84
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:16,786
This one's singing solo.

85
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,453
The next one.

86
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:22,702
There'll be two others there.
A guitarist singing Hip-Hop and-

87
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,411
- this one singing
a traditional solo, right?

88
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:29,784
Wait, this is another one.

89
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,367
All of us have to fit here.
Amir, you in the corner, me the.

90
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:39,200
Mahla, you stand
a bit closer than this girl.

91
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:42,075
With confidence.

92
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,574
This girl isn't anything specia.

93
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,657
It's just two chords.

94
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,449
Don't worry.

95
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:54,156
We'll pick Davood up.
Us three, with three chords,

96
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:55,948
will win their hearts.

97
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,156
That's the way.

98
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:01,406
With Davood,
all our problems will go away.

99
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,447
Just don't you worry.

100
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:09,029
Just remember all that I've
told you, and we'll be fine.

101
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:12,113
Amir, slow down.

102
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:15,237
Amir, you drove us into the sea.

103
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:21,987
Amir, drive.

104
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:25,069
This way.

105
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,569
More.

106
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,652
This way. Don't be afraid.

107
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:33,026
Good, stop.

108
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,734
Turn around.

109
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:39,276
Come on.

110
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,942
Stop.

111
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:44,733
Turn it.

112
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:51,150
Come. Come.

113
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:53,816
I'm standing on the asphalt.

114
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:57,898
You're doing it.

115
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Stop. Stop.

116
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,981
Come.

117
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,730
Come, come.

118
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:10,939
Stop.

119
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,521
Perfect.

120
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,937
Just take this to the main road
I swear to God it’s safer.

121
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:26,020
We can’t even tell the differen
between the main or the side ro!

122
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:27,145
It’s all mixed up.

123
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:29,894
Then at least
turn on that damn radio.

124
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,769
You and your radio radio!
When does the radio ever tell t?

125
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:36,352
Whatever they say we’ll
do the opposite, it’ll work out.

126
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:40,060
Alright stop. I know this side
that’s better than all the othe.

127
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:43,809
Amir, I can’t handle another
side road to nowhere.

128
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,892
Please Amir!
No more side roads.

129
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,268
Mahla!
I know the way!

130
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:50,017
Sure. You know.

131
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,891
Mr. Know-it-all!

132
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,888
<i>...And all this heavy
</i>raining has led to this disaste

133
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,805
Is that Abed's car?

134
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:23,055
It's Abed.

135
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:25,221
Yeah, it's Abed Stop the car.

136
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,637
It's Abed.

137
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:34,095
It's Abed!

138
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:36,553
It's Abed!

139
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,636
Amir, stop and help him.

140
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:41,510
I can't just press
pause on this crappy van!

141
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:47,218
Oh look, he's stuck in mud.

142
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:52,135
Poor thing!
His parents are with him too.

143
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,092
Abed!

144
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:01,217
It's such a mess.
Amir, go help them.

145
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,757
If we keep making stops,
we won't make it to Tehran in t.

146
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,299
Mark my words.

147
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,507
Stop whining.

148
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:12,257
They're stuck for good.

149
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:18,048
Open the door
so they can come and sit here.

150
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,588
Amir, a cable.

151
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,963
I have a cable.

152
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,587
-<i> They seeded the clouds.
</i>- Who did? You?

153
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,421
They made it rain.

154
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:35,005
- Are there any tourists?
- Do floods bring tourists?

155
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,545
- Are you going to Tehran?
- We'll stop at Mitra's first,

156
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,461
and then check on our own place.

157
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:44,086
I'm taking my folks to Dezful.
It's too damp here.

158
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,544
You're the one who needs help.

159
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:51,168
A girl in her state
shouldn't be traveling.

160
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,960
Don't worry about us.
Get your car out of the mud fir.

161
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,834
<i>Off to Tehran we go,</i>

162
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,874
<i>We three fools...</i>

163
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,582
- You’re off beat.
- On purpose.

164
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:15,082
She made a mistake.
Let it go.

165
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:30,622
Can we win first place like thi?

166
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:33,371
The three idiots.
Look at us.

167
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:40,537
When we go stage you just
move your lips and I’ll sing.

168
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,704
- Agreed?
- Okay.

169
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,370
I have a great voice.

172
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:01,577
Sing Mahla.
Show him what you got!

173
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:03,242
Okay, sing it.

174
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:05,784
I want you to sing.

175
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:10,701
<i>"When your eyebrows
</i>calmly twist together  "

176
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:14,825
Our prize will be a lollipop.

177
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:18,449
It’s better than getting
kicked out with nothing.

178
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:22,407
- And you can’t even sing one l.
- They’ll kick you off the stag.

179
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:26,740
- But I'm super talented!
- Shut up! Amir, you sing.

180
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:28,573
I'm on the road to fame.

181
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:30,406
Navid, be quiet.
Amir, you sing instead.

182
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,156
Me?

183
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:34,947
Start and I’ll sing.

184
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:03,477
Sir, come here.

185
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,185
Their only assistance is blocki.

186
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:17,601
<i>This road's closed.</i>

187
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:18,851
<i>Turn around!</i>

188
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,017
Salaam.

189
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:26,017
Sir, sir.
Come here.

190
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,474
We live here.

191
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:33,141
We can't turn around,
my wife is pregnant.

192
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:36,306
Please let us through.

193
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:39,932
<i>They're delivering supplies.</i>

194
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:43,723
Will you listen to us!

195
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:45,014
I live over there.

196
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:48,264
I'm a local.
Will you please let me through?!

197
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:49,848
<i>Turn around.</i>

198
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:52,972
<i>Turn around.
</i>Only emergency vehicles can pas.

199
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:58,555
Let me deliver the supplies.
I know the way.

200
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:01,637
Thank you, man.

201
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,637
Do you know the area?

202
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,845
Yes, we're from here!

203
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:13,219
Go forward and
turn left at the rugs.

204
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:16,969
Iran really does have
the world's best rescue teams.

205
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,593
We have floods and earthquakes,
forest fires and plane crashes.

206
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:23,884
- What would we do without you?
- Stop here.

207
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:26,634
<i>Come and put these in their van.</i>

208
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,426
Brother, what's your name?

209
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,133
Navid.

210
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:36,717
Tie down the rugs
and the blankets on the roof.

211
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:45,007
Put those on the roof.

212
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:02,130
Enough, we're full.

213
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:05,004
- One more.
- No, no, no.

214
00:22:09,337 --> 00:22:11,545
Mahla, get in.

215
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,043
Enough, we're full!

216
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:21,711
Why did you get out?

217
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:25,669
I wanted to see what they had.

218
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:31,501
Amir, let's go before
he changes his mind.

219
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,293
God bless him.

220
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,542
Are there a bunch of diapers?

221
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:42,999
There's everything.

222
00:22:45,374 --> 00:22:47,666
What should we do?

223
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:52,248
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

224
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,790
<i>First let this tractor through,.</i>

225
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:59,414
Sorry.

226
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,455
We can go now.

227
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:05,539
Okay.

228
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,663
Take these to the tents.

229
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:15,620
Thank you.

230
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,829
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God help us.

231
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,995
Mahla, don't look.

232
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:27,536
Thanks.

233
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:59,240
We'll save these for baby Nila.

234
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:01,198
<i>Why not keep it all for Nila?</i>

235
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,281
Here, take these.

236
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:04,989
Here.

237
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:18,155
And these.

238
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:27,027
Look, refugee tents.

239
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,777
<i>It's like a village of tents!</i>

240
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,527
They're flood victims too.
Let's just give it to them.

241
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:59,898
Here you are.
Take this.

242
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,441
Water.

243
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:08,814
<i>Diapers, please.</i>

244
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:14,231
Diapers.

245
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:21,021
Who wants diapers?

246
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,688
- Diapers.
- Shampoo.

247
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:30,396
I'll unload the top.

248
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:37,478
[Folk song]

249
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:59,509
I swear you're wrong,
she's probably in those white t.

250
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,717
Mitra will be fine.

251
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:04,675
I didn't say she wouldn't be.
They're up to their necks in mu.

252
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:07,632
What sane person lives here?

253
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:09,508
I need her clothes.

254
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,091
One-track mind!
All these cars are stuck.

255
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,631
He's right.

256
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:20,507
There's a mudslide.
How can we get by?

257
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:27,589
And all you talk
about are her clothes!

258
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:33,963
They're all leaving
from where we're headed!

259
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,171
Why did you stop?

260
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:41,087
This bridge is too weak to cros.

261
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:46,004
Let me out, I'll go.

262
00:27:46,045 --> 00:27:48,378
Bring the watermelons.

263
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,003
Mahla, wait.
Maybe there's nobody there.

264
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:55,127
Maybe she won't be there.

265
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:57,002
Amir, say something to her.

266
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,252
I can't.

267
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,834
I know this is a waste of time.

268
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:09,917
There's nobody in this mud.

269
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:15,833
Lock the doors
and turn off the engine.

270
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:20,249
Lock this door.

271
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,661
Mitra!

272
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:05,119
- Have you seen Mitra?
- Mitra!

273
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,576
She's there.

274
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:12,534
Mitra!

275
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:18,992
Auntie!

276
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,992
Everything's gone!

277
00:29:25,824 --> 00:29:28,074
I can't believe this!

278
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,407
Have you seen Mitra?

279
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,322
I hear Mitra's voice.

280
00:29:45,364 --> 00:29:49,404
<i>Be careful kids! Calm down.</i>

281
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:56,737
<i>Here, take my hand.</i>

282
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:58,486
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

283
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:03,610
<i>Amir, help get the kids.</i>

284
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:06,278
<i>Wait for me.</i>

285
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:11,401
- Hi!
- What are you doing?

286
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:16,193
Take care of the girl.

287
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:18,984
He lost his shoes.

288
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,400
Hold his hand.

289
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:23,734
Do you have your van?

290
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:27,108
Listen to me.
Go back to the bridge.

291
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,691
Take all these kids
to the relief workers there.

292
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:33,524
Go under the wire.

293
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,315
Put them in your van
and take them to the tents.

294
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:37,940
How are you?

295
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:40,107
Why did you come?

296
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:41,732
Don't be afraid.

297
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,355
Pay attention to these two.

298
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:48,564
- Navid, count them.
- We'll watch them.

299
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:53,354
- It was hell getting here.
- Stop yelling.

300
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:56,063
Don't let go of me,
you'll get stuck in the mud.

301
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:08,061
- Why did they come here?
- I was going crazy, the lines .

302
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,352
Don't fall.

303
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:16,685
Amir, do you remember Aunt Zohr?

304
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,269
Her son's here.

305
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,977
Wait, my shoe's stuck.

306
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:24,726
Where are you staying now?
Did they give you a tent?

307
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:26,851
Come on up and see.

308
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:31,850
- So where are you staying?
- Be careful, there's a well ov.

309
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,891
Let me go first.

310
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:38,348
Count them, Navid.

311
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,682
Make sure no one's left behind.

312
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:43,307
Hold on to me.

313
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,389
- What are these?
- Food for the kids.

314
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:50,098
Farideh, come here a minute.

315
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:52,264
Do you have boots on?

316
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:56,847
Can you pass these out?
I can't move.

317
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:58,847
Take these too.

318
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,637
So did you get a tent?

319
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,679
Yes, they did.

320
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,387
And the school?

321
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,387
It's full of mud.

322
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,971
What are you doing here?

323
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:13,220
I came to get a dress.

324
00:32:13,886 --> 00:32:17,511
I came to get a dress.
Don't laugh!

325
00:32:17,553 --> 00:32:21,385
My clothes are all gone.

326
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:24,635
Look in the closet.

327
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,759
- What should I do?
- What's the dress for?

328
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,801
I'm going to perform on stage t!

329
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:33,968
- Really? Tonight?
- We'll pick Navid's guitar up .

330
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,800
- Your dress is fine!
- No it's not! It's embarrassin!

331
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:39,009
You don’t have any dresses.
I’ll put on some make up and g.

332
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,717
- You look like a rockstar!
- No, I don't!

333
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:45,340
- Have you rehearsed at all?
- A little, with Navid.

334
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:49,340
Don't embarrass us!
Let me hear you sing.

335
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:52,965
I was really worried about you.

336
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:57,590
Yeah right!
I thought you're here for my cl.

337
00:32:57,631 --> 00:33:01,547
- Don't you think you're too pr!
- No, I'm not!

338
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:03,964
Don't move around so much.

339
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:06,754
Is Mr. Mansour playing?

340
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:09,796
- He's not well.
- What's he playing during a fl?

341
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:12,337
He's lost his mind.

342
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:19,744
The road is closed.

343
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:22,161
He says it's closed.

344
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:29,119
- He said the road's closed.
- I can see that.

345
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:31,285
I can't turn around.

346
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:32,995
I said it would be closed.

347
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:36,326
I have to turn around.

348
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,160
What's going on here?

349
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:50,116
It's so crowded.

350
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:01,532
It's a 'Wailing Song.'

351
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:09,281
When did he get out?!

352
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,196
<i>The flood wanted to make us wee.</i>

353
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:18,238
<i>But we built levees
</i>and made the flood cry.

354
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:35,812
How's it going?

355
00:36:35,854 --> 00:36:38,604
<i>Don't get stuck up ahead.</i>

356
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:41,770
- I know my way around here.
- Have you been here before?

357
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:44,561
Yes, I have.

358
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:47,894
I know it well.

359
00:36:48,144 --> 00:36:50,101
Thanks.

360
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:43,178
Amir, is this the right way?

361
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,261
Yes, it is. I know the way.

362
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:49,636
Ask somebody.

363
00:37:52,094 --> 00:37:54,343
Turn around here.

364
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:56,218
Let this guy pass.

365
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:05,342
Hello, does this road go throug?

366
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:06,759
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

367
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:09,217
Straight to Tehran.

368
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:11,133
<i>You have to turn around.</i>

369
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:13,508
I told you we were lost.

370
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:17,300
- Did you go through the flood?
-<i> Yes.</i>

371
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:26,590
<i>All the roads are closed.
</i>Follow me.

372
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,881
- We will.
-<i> Turn around and follow.</i>

373
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:35,547
Why do you say you know the way?

374
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:37,172
You were getting us lost.

375
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:41,046
Could you be quiet for a bit,
or not?

376
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,836
He won't listen.

377
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:07,460
See if they have any water.

378
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,667
Do you have any water?

379
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:17,791
My wife is pregnant.

380
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,375
Can you give us some water?

381
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:29,124
-<i> Take this bottle. </i>.
- Thanks.

382
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,914
- Thanks.
-<i> Do you need cups?</i>

383
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:39,038
No, no.

384
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,622
We were dying of thirst.

385
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:54,537
- Don't drown us.
- I can see the road, my love.

386
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:58,870
I can tell from how you drive.

387
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:02,494
God knows where
you were taking us.

388
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:08,994
<i>Lalalalala...</i>

389
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:12,660
<i>Do not be afraid, no one is com.</i>

390
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:20,200
<i>Do not be afraid,
</i>no one will bother us.

391
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:29,616
<i>When your eyelashes
</i>calmly come together.

392
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:36,698
<i>And they intertwine like vines,</i>

393
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:44,364
<i>and they calmly become one.
</i>Your eyelashes calmly intertwin!

394
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:51,238
<i>I feel like I can hear
</i>them in the dark, calmly.

395
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,863
<i>Calmly, calmly Oh, so calmly.</i>

396
00:40:55,904 --> 00:40:58,612
Oh my God!

397
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:40,100
This is our luck!
The same day we need to go on s,

398
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,057
all the roads are washed away.

399
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,474
Amir, will you
please stop whining.

400
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:47,599
I can't stop seeing this.
You're getting on our nerves.

401
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,598
I say this can be good for us.

402
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,390
Stay positive and this
will lead us to our big break.

403
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:56,973
We will rock the house.

404
00:42:57,015 --> 00:43:01,597
And if we promote
ourselves on social media,

405
00:43:01,638 --> 00:43:05,430
we'll become famous
and rock the world!

406
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:11,554
We'll go abroad, earn Euros and
go play music in Latin America..

407
00:43:11,596 --> 00:43:13,845
and live the life.

408
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:20,387
- Where in Latin America?
- Brazil, bro! Columbia. Venezu-

409
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:25,677
The Venezuelans are starving!
They're all leaving their count.

410
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,844
Have you seen Venezuela?

411
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:29,468
Yes, I've seen it.

412
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:34,509
- Seen what?
- You haven't even left our pro!

413
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:36,926
Let me show it to you.

414
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:38,967
Give me a cigarette.

415
00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:40,967
- You want to smoke?
- Just a puff.

416
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:47,008
Did I put up all these 'No Smok'
signs for random tourists?!

417
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:50,008
It's a craving.
One puff won't do any harm.

418
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:51,716
What an idiotic craving.

419
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,798
Listen to this cool song.

420
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:05,006
You might have made it big
but you'll never change.

421
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:11,463
Mahla, didn't you know?!
Navid's been around the world!

422
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,754
Only you know that.

423
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:17,462
Now give me a puff.

424
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:19,087
Throw that damn thing out.

425
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:20,879
It's gone.

426
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:29,295
Hello Mrs. Khoshdel
we're running late.

427
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:33,211
Can you hear me?
It's disconnected.

428
00:44:54,375 --> 00:45:02,373
<i>Brother Davood, Brother Davood,</i>

429
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:05,873
<i>You can never be replaced by anr</i>

430
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:08,789
<i>You sweeten our tea,
</i>you fill us with glee

431
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:14,289
<i>You're our David Gilmour,
</i>our band's navigator

432
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:22,329
Brother Davood, Brother Davood!

433
00:45:28,954 --> 00:45:35,828
You come before and after.
You fill us with laughter

434
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:44,493
Our band's navigator
David Gilmour, Brother Davood...

435
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:21,405
Mahla, be careful my love.

436
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,405
Think of our baby Nila.

437
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:28,196
Becoming a dad is awesome, righ?
Too bad, I wasn't so lucky.

438
00:46:28,238 --> 00:46:32,071
If not, I'd have four little ons
running around us right here.

439
00:46:32,738 --> 00:46:35,320
- Navid!
- What?

440
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:40,737
Maybe I'm not thinking straight.

441
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:47,736
My home, my life,
the hostel... They're all washe.

442
00:46:47,777 --> 00:46:52,110
Don't think about it.
You're too hard on yourself.

443
00:46:52,152 --> 00:46:54,193
The hostel was part mine too.

444
00:46:54,235 --> 00:46:57,900
When we get back where will
my wife and kid live?

445
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:01,525
In my place.
Or maybe out in nature.

446
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:04,317
Enjoy life.
Imagine raising you kids out he.

447
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:08,191
- They'd love it.
- Under these conditions?

448
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:11,983
You don't understand me.

449
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:26,647
<i>The road is open and it goes ard
</i>Bandar Band never loses its soud

450
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:34,438
Mahala, we'll be there
a half an hour early.

451
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,437
If you step on the gas
we'll have time to practice.

452
00:47:37,478 --> 00:47:38,896
I'll step on it.

453
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:45,978
<i>Amir go faster, floor it!
</i>Don't drive like a turtle.

454
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,394
You jerk!
Am I driving like a turtle?

455
00:47:48,436 --> 00:47:51,352
- Just like a turtle.
- Watch me grow wings and fly.

456
00:47:51,394 --> 00:47:53,435
There's no more water.
No more flood.

457
00:47:53,476 --> 00:47:55,435
The road's wide open.
Just step on the gas.

458
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:58,560
Stop saying 'water' and 'flood'!
You'll jinx us.

459
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:02,309
When we get to Tehran let's
have a watermelon shake.

460
00:48:02,601 --> 00:48:05,851
Melon yes, water no!

461
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:08,184
Every way we went,
they'd turn us back.

462
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:09,600
Do this, do that.

463
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:10,850
Do that, do this.

464
00:48:10,892 --> 00:48:12,558
I was losing my mind.

465
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,433
Come on, bro, step on the gas.

466
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:17,473
I'm flooring it!

467
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:21,182
Oh, oh! Slow down.

468
00:48:21,223 --> 00:48:25,057
It's the cops. Don't stop.

469
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:27,890
- Why shouldn't I stop?
- They'll confiscate the car.

470
00:48:27,931 --> 00:48:30,139
Don't stop Amir!

471
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:32,431
If they chase us,
we lose the van.

472
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:37,388
Oh, God. Amir, we're screwed.

473
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,305
<i>What's the rush?</i>

474
00:48:39,346 --> 00:48:41,804
- License and registration.
- But, why?

475
00:48:41,846 --> 00:48:43,929
Why?!
Your license and registration!

476
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,304
- Come on, buddy.
- I was only going 60.

477
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:47,179
Buddy?! Get out!

478
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,636
This guy is crazy.

479
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:52,303
Amir, I told you not to pull ov.

480
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:55,012
Listen to what I say.

481
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:03,552
Sir, we have everything under control

482
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:05,801
The flood hasn't reached us yet.

483
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:09,259
We are well-prepared for any pr.

484
00:49:09,301 --> 00:49:12,301
We just need reinforcements.
I haven't seen my family in fiv.

485
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,717
Hello Mr. Shapoori.

486
00:49:14,759 --> 00:49:17,800
How can I help you?

487
00:49:17,842 --> 00:49:19,592
How are you?

488
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:23,549
- Driver?
- He is the driver.

489
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:28,758
Our radar clocked you at 160 km.

490
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,298
This van can barely do 100 km/h!

491
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:33,923
And my wife is pregnant.

492
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:36,882
Your wife is pregnant?!
Your excuse is worse than your .

493
00:49:36,923 --> 00:49:39,797
You want to kill yourself
and your wife and baby!

494
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,338
- His home was washed away.
- So was mine. That's no excuse.

495
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,254
Sir, we're late for a concert.
We're going to perform.

496
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,296
We have to tow your van.
Give us the keys.

497
00:49:49,337 --> 00:49:51,546
- Do not touch me!
- Officer Shapoori, please.

498
00:49:52,296 --> 00:49:55,086
We have to go on stage.

499
00:49:55,128 --> 00:50:00,754
I swear to God,
we are performing.

500
00:50:00,795 --> 00:50:02,419
Are you actors?

501
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:05,586
We're musicians.
I'm a singer/songwriter.

502
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,335
He's a great musician.

503
00:50:07,377 --> 00:50:09,418
Do you sing? What's your name?

504
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,918
Navid. I'm not famous yet.

505
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,002
But soon you'll want a photo wi!

506
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:19,542
- Let me hear you sing.
- I can't like this. I need my .

507
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:23,375
- Go get your instrument.
- Are you serious?

508
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:26,666
Officer Shapoori told you
to go and get your instrument.

509
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,374
Don't touch me!

510
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,624
- Can he really sing?
- He's going to be famous soon.

511
00:50:33,874 --> 00:50:35,874
We'll see.

512
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:40,332
- What's happening?
- Everything's gonna be all rig.

513
00:50:53,371 --> 00:50:58,579
<i>Take a back seat
</i>Let me accelerate

514
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:03,412
<i>Let's travel the world
</i>I can't wait

515
00:51:03,454 --> 00:51:08,453
<i>Stay where you are
</i>Accept your fate

516
00:51:08,494 --> 00:51:13,035
<i>Learn how to behave
</i>We have no manners

517
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:17,035
<i>Will somebody hold me back?
</i>To get my baby back.

518
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:47,406
<i>I'll become the Pink Panther
</i>I might not have the answer

519
00:51:47,448 --> 00:51:52,364
<i>But I need to make things right.</i>

520
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:56,988
<i>Will somebody hold me back?</i>

521
00:52:17,152 --> 00:52:22,235
<i>Don't end things, it's time to t
</i>Even with my pretty face

522
00:52:22,277 --> 00:52:26,901
<i>You broke my heart
</i>So glue it back in place

523
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:34,941
<i>Will somebody hold me back?</i>

524
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:10,854
Over there.

525
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:13,312
Here.

526
00:53:17,103 --> 00:53:18,520
Clean it.

527
00:53:21,394 --> 00:53:24,311
Clean this windshield.

528
00:53:43,808 --> 00:53:47,849
We'll be with Davood soon.
Don't embarrass me.

529
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,849
Let's practice your singing.

530
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:45,259
Faster.

531
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:51,633
What's up? Again!

532
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,592
Open the door. Hurry.

533
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,423
Is anybody there?

534
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:16,172
- Amir!
- What?

535
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,713
No one is here.
I don't know what's going on.

536
00:55:18,755 --> 00:55:20,962
I'm going to pick Davood up.

537
00:55:21,004 --> 00:55:22,879
I'll be right back.

538
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:34,086
<i>- Amir! Nila is kicking.
</i>- Our lovely baby.

539
00:55:45,293 --> 00:55:52,958
<i>La la la. Don't be afraid.
</i>No one's coming.

540
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,915
<i>La la la do not be afraid,
</i>no one will bother us

541
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:07,707
<i>When your eyelashes
</i>calmly come together

542
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:15,831
<i>And they intertwine like vines</i>

543
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:23,372
<i>Your eyelashes
</i>calmly intertwine

544
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:30,621
<i>I feel I can hear
</i>them in the dark, calmly

545
00:56:30,662 --> 00:56:34,537
<i>Calmly, calmly</i>

546
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:38,911
<i>Oh, so calmly.</i>

547
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:06,408
Check it out.
It's Davood.

548
00:57:23,364 --> 00:57:25,906
Let him be.

549
00:57:26,406 --> 00:57:29,363
He's turned into a raft.

550
00:57:39,112 --> 00:57:45,777
<i>A rifleless rider has no strengh</i>

551
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:52,943
<i>He needs a rifle to ride away</i>

552
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:59,319
<i>A rifleless rider has no strengh</i>

553
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:09,358
<i>He needs a rifle to ride away</i>

554
00:58:11,108 --> 00:58:13,649
Let's go, Navid.

555
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:26,064
<i>They say horses are wartime fris</i>

556
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:34,022
<i>We say rifles are better friends</i>

557
00:58:35,189 --> 00:58:43,896
<i>A rifleless rider has no strengh</i>

558
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:50,644
<i>He needs a rifle to ride away</i>

559
00:58:50,686 --> 00:58:57,727
<i>He needs a rifle to ride away</i>

560
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:14,933
<i>I sold my silver-handled rifle</i>

561
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:21,224
<i>I sent my love a cashmere cloak</i>

562
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:30,098
<i>And my love sent it right back</i>

563
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,098
<i>My silver-handled rifle,</i>

564
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:37,764
<i>Is there no justice?</i>

565
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:45,180
<i>My silver-handled rifle,
</i>Is there no justice?

566
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,882
Amir, stop.
I feel sick.

567
01:00:59,129 --> 01:01:00,254
Navid!

568
01:01:00,295 --> 01:01:03,171
Let me go! Get lost!

569
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:30,367
- Amir!
- What?

570
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,075
Yes?

571
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,241
Amir, where's Nazgol.

572
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:38,533
She left.

573
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:40,407
With who?

574
01:02:40,449 --> 01:02:42,741
With Saghar.

575
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:45,074
Saghar?

576
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:55,157
Who's Saghar?

577
01:02:55,198 --> 01:02:58,947
Abed's ex-girlfriend.

578
01:03:02,906 --> 01:03:06,362
We may have
given him too many pills!

579
01:03:10,488 --> 01:03:15,112
<i>I think in someone's
</i>dream, Iran is flooded.

580
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:20,360
<i>In someone's deep sleep.</i>

581
01:03:23,527 --> 01:03:26,069
<i>I think we're in his dream.</i>

582
01:03:26,486 --> 01:03:30,027
<i>If he wakes up
</i>the flood waters will drain.

583
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,818
<i>I think he's also late.</i>

584
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:38,150
<i>He's taking a boat to Tehran.</i>

585
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:42,859
<i>We're always in
</i>a hurry to arrive in Tehran.

586
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:46,566
<i>This is the first
</i>pastime of our lives.

587
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:53,648
<i>And I suppose afterwards,
</i>Berlin, Paris, Los Angeles.

588
01:03:54,523 --> 01:03:59,231
<i>As if this land is such
</i>that the further away you get,

589
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:02,814
<i>the more of
</i>an accomplishment it is.

590
01:04:02,856 --> 01:04:04,522
<i>It's sad.</i>

591
01:04:06,105 --> 01:04:09,022
<i>I wish that fellow wakes up.</i>

592
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:12,104
<i>So the flood waters can drain.</i>

593
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:43,329
<i>Wet travelers and...</i>

594
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,745
<i>wet traveler checks</i>

595
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:58,035
<i>Traffic cops in water</i>

596
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:06,909
<i>up to their necks</i>

597
01:08:12,157 --> 01:08:19,073
<i>My horse got all wet
</i>slipped from my saddle

598
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:29,156
<i>A drainpipe grew from
</i>my aching collarbone

599
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:44,362
<i>Rain pours down all day long
</i>from the roof of this song

600
01:08:44,403 --> 01:08:54,403
<i>From my knee cap
</i>to my guitar strap

601
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:10,318
<i>It's not rain, it's spears</i>

602
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:15,524
<i>Six feet long spears</i>

603
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:22,065
<i>Both the water is scared</i>

604
01:09:22,774 --> 01:09:31,439
<i>and the kettle's pipe</i>

605
01:09:37,021 --> 01:09:43,813
<i>It comes down to kill
</i>shaped like a thrill

606
01:09:43,854 --> 01:09:48,063
<i>It pours down completley</i>

607
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:52,936
On the city's architecture

608
01:09:56,437 --> 01:10:03,102
<i>The rain said something,
</i>The rain chanted a spell

609
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:11,143
<i>The people are crushed
</i>when the ceiling hits the floor

610
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:23,059
<i>This rain is thick
</i>and hard as a brick

611
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:31,724
<i>Rain rain falling pain
</i>rain rain, again and again

612
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:43,097
<i>Rain rain, pain pain
</i>again and again

613
01:10:46,514 --> 01:10:54,513
<i>Rain rain, pain pain
</i>again and again

614
01:10:56,554 --> 01:11:01,179
<i>Rain and pain again</i>

615
01:11:03,262 --> 01:11:12,843
<i>Rain and pain again</i>

616
01:14:35,196 --> 01:14:40,196
