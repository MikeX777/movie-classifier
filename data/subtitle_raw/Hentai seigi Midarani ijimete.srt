1
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,028
I had said to catch him first!

2
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,657
He must be killed by his own men

3
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,634
We've lost our clues

4
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,769
I had asked
to keep him under surveillance

5
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,033
What do your people do?

6
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,904
How can you blame me?

7
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,071
You know
Or Wing Fu keeps many Vietnameses

8
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,070
They had been through the war!

9
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,912
If you are that good

10
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,647
grab a killer and show us!

11
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,279
Do you think you are Stallon!

12
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,681
Don't argue here!

13
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,956
I've kept an eye on Or Wing Fu this long

14
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,394
I have to put him in jail this time

15
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,364
It doesn't matter this man dies

16
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,731
I have one more witness to accuse him

17
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:14,104
You two be careful, no more mistakes

18
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,151
Skinny accuses Or Wing Fu in court!

19
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,485
Yeah, he betrayed Or Wing Fu!

20
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,114
I heard that he had been his follower

21
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,090
Who would be loyal these days!

22
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,160
You two go over there! Yes!

23
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,169
Don't stand here!

24
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,005
Did you hear me? Go away!

25
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,808
Give way!

26
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,274
Give way!

27
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,980
Don't get too close Watch out

28
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,185
What's the matter, this early?

29
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,824
I've done everything you said

30
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,958
Well, people say 'time will tell'!

31
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,160
They deserved it!

32
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,264
I'm afraid the police won't stop!

33
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,208
I had told them to hide for a while!

34
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,744
Stop the business in Thailand

35
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,349
I had told them to stop

36
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,784
we can start again later!

37
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,947
We smuggled fire-arms in the Korean War

38
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,150
We dealt with drugs in riots

39
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,159
We helped people sneak-in in Vietnam

40
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,888
We've got enough money

41
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,588
Boss, you mean...

42
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,431
That's not much left in HK
I wanna emigrate

43
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,197
and you should retire too

44
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,999
Yuen Lick is with you?

45
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,070
I'll give you some names tonight

46
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,374
Ask Yuen Lick to do it, no trace

47
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,879
Master, breakfast is ready

48
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,091
And Master, your daughter had rung

49
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,989
She'll have OT tonight
not having dinner

50
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,253
Not coming back again!

51
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,323
You ring her up for me!

52
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,201
Hello

53
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,896
Please wait!

54
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,804
Pui Lam, your call!

55
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,402
Thanks!

56
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,811
Daddy!

57
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,547
Dinner?

58
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,546
No, I'm busy!

59
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,617
Aren't you going to Thailand?

60
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,185
When?

61
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,422
OK, bye!

62
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,129
We should go to the press conference!

63
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,965
What do the police have to say
on the killing?

64
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,366
We are investigating it!

65
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,562
We have set up a task-force

66
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,401
We believe that
we can have a report soon

67
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,372
According to our investigation

68
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,205
the suspect got gunned down yesterday

69
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,370
is a migrant from Vietnam!

70
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,614
We have so many killings lately!

71
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,183
What is the tactic of the police?

72
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,619
Well, we have a bit more killings lately

73
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,985
around 80%

74
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,056
but not that many deaths

75
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,125
We had 21 traffic deaths last month

76
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,320
excluding the one
who jumped off the train

77
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,762
Relatively, not that many killings!

78
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,233
Does it link with the special case?

79
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:41,170
We have given information
to the task force!

80
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,605
Because of the killing
of the two witnesses

81
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,870
will the police stand stronger
against the triads?

82
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,876
Of course, no doubt

83
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,672
I can tell you now!

84
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,080
The information on triads

85
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,245
is in the hand of the police

86
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,549
I believe when the time comes later

87
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,183
we will have a lot of operations

88
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,130
When do the police think
the time is right?

89
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,093
When is the right time?
Hard to say!

90
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,392
The criminals are smart!

91
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,560
We want to avoid alerting them

92
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,765
So I can't answer this!

93
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,838
We have to stop right here!

94
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,465
Thanks for coming!

95
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,369
This press conference
is time wasting!

96
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,148
Thanks everyone of you!

97
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,046
Any more questions?

98
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,791
Here is your pay!

99
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,834
Man killed Skinny outside the court!

100
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,766
And you killed Opium Hung

101
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,735
I think that the police must be angry

102
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,365
But Man was killed, too!

103
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,638
He had a grand-mum
did you give her money?

104
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,077
I talk it over with boss!

105
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,114
He is narrow-minded, I think he won't

106
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,845
That's too bad!

107
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,911
Man and I had been in Hong Kong
these years!

108
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,287
We had been working for him

109
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,326
You Vietnameses, what else can you do?

110
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,555
What can you do in Hong Kong?

111
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,789
Risk for rich, no one forces you!

112
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,768
You have to be careful!

113
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,899
Don't copy what Man had done!

114
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,878
He deserved death!

115
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,106
He didn't want to kill

116
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:40,156
I'm like him, was a soldier in Vietnam

117
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,624
I had killed!

118
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,026
Killed many people

119
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,631
I killed in Vietnam

120
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,332
I kill here in Hong Kong too

121
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,812
Boss asks you to finish the rest tonight

122
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,114
Tonight?

123
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,115
I'm afraid it's not the right time

124
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,911
People had been alerted!

125
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,151
If they are afraid
and co-operate with the police

126
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,684
that's the end to us!

127
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,626
But

128
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,725
Either he dies or I die

129
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,265
How many did you kill in Vietnam?

130
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,428
Here is Hong Kong

131
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:30,266
The same, it is a cruel
and realistic world

132
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,575
You have to be the first one to win!

133
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,409
And leaving no trace!

134
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,048
I could get you out from Vietnam!

135
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,651
I can get your family out, too

136
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,891
Money is the most important

137
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,958
Man!

138
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,629
Man, how are you?

139
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,188
Who is that?

140
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,724
It's Licky!

141
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:59,330
Hi, come in! Thanks!

142
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,840
Tea!

143
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,241
Thanks!

144
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,115
That's alright!

145
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,210
Ah, how is my grand-son Man?

146
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,119
Why didn't he come with you?

147
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,820
He is busy!

148
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,393
He went to Thailand to do business!

149
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,601
He asked me to give you the money!

150
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,271
And some roast pork bun!

151
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,999
Thanks!

152
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,844
Did Man write to you?

153
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:53,983
Yes!

154
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,780
What did he say?

155
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,093
I read it to you!

156
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,966
Dear Licky, how are you?

157
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,501
I am fine in Thailand

158
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:24,177
Go to see my Grand-mum if you can

159
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,411
Bring her some roast pork bun

160
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,556
I'll be back soon!

161
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,122
Tell my Grand-mum

162
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,764
I don't gamble anymore

163
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,867
Licky, I had been saving up in Vietnam

164
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,968
I wanna send you aboard to study

165
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,942
Didn't expect I use the money

166
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,746
to let you refuge to Hong Kong

167
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,917
You keep it!

168
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,515
Brother!

169
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,584
Licky, take care!

170
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,224
Get on board, quick!

171
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,193
Licky, take care!

172
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,737
Brother...

173
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,806
I'll get you to Hong Kong too!

174
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,605
Licky, this is Fenny!

175
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,275
I've finished shooting
Let's go to disco

176
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,442
I have no time!

177
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,845
Ask Kenny!

178
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,008
Why?

179
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,621
Don't ask, decided!

180
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,460
Boss asks you to finish
the rest tonight

181
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,101
Leave no trace!

182
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,504
Fan Man Pui!

183
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,130
What's happening to Licky lately?

184
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,631
He's always like this!

185
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,316
I know, the report is here

186
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,513
OK, I bring it over later

187
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,751
OK, no problem. See you

188
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,256
What then, finished?

189
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,419
It's a busy day, two scenes

190
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,327
What cases?

191
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,931
Two killings!

192
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,557
Horrible!

193
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,931
Police, this is Fuji Hotel

194
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,273
Main switch!

195
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,039
This is main switch

196
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,310
I'm Or Pui Lam
I'm now on location, over!

197
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,375
How is it? You need help?

198
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,281
Why don't you talk, over!

199
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,187
Don't ask, Miss Or is upset
She's gone, over!

200
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,218
What upset her?

201
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,227
You looked down on her
she needed no help!

202
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,361
OK, you two go up there OK

203
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,729
I stay here

204
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,599
No, you can't enter

205
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,430
No!

206
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,372
Let us go up, we are reporters!

207
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,971
Please be quiet!

208
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,603
Is it a male or female?

209
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,875
We just arrived, we know nothing

210
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,675
Is it suicide? Let's go up!

211
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,380
We don't really know, ask the police!

212
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:47,618
Be quiet. Captain Ng is coming!

213
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,587
Please be quiet!

214
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,958
Is it the revenge of triads?

215
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,323
Right, tell us Captain Ng!

216
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,502
At 5:00 a.m., this morning, a waiter

217
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,801
found a dead male body in a room
he called the police

218
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,338
How did he die?

219
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,805
We have to wait for the coroner!

220
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,310
Does it link with the other killings?

221
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,540
It's under investigation!

222
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,715
Please give way!

223
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,316
Watch out It's coming down

224
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,481
Excuse us. We're taking this out

225
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,517
At 5:00 a.m., on 2/F, Fuji Hotel

226
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,061
A man was found dead in his room!

227
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,255
When he was found...

228
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,830
Pang, come here!

229
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:33,401
Inspector Lau
the task force is two months now

230
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,871
and the case is still these

231
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:35,938
and someone got killed

232
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,668
What do you have to say?

233
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,902
What, you can't face it?

234
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,083
He's unlucky coming across you!

235
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,053
Let's go!

236
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,762
Nothing else

237
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,307
Brother, we have got your parcel!

238
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:17,575
Mum was happy, we all miss you!

239
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,810
The government
is having an economic reform

240
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,945
The Chinese shops are closed

241
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,387
They say dad messes up the finance

242
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,253
officers come to get information
all the time

243
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,484
You are late?

244
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:31,959
Well, I hurried!

245
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,228
Dad is getting worse, mum worries!

246
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,667
We all want to unite with you
in Hong Kong

247
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,203
But we have to
give 30 Oz of gold each to get out

248
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,573
We are not sure if we can see you again!

249
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,783
It's news time!

250
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,692
A man was found dead
in the Fuji Hotel at 5:00 a.m.

251
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,891
He was of the 30's

252
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,836
A waiter found him dead in his room

253
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,529
and called the police

254
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,431
According to the coroner

255
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,406
he was beaten to death

256
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:23,904
It's the 5th killing this week

257
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,611
The police had set up a task force

258
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,652
to investigate the case

259
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,053
International news

260
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,870
Inspector Lau, can I sit down?

261
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,405
Why eat alone?

262
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,709
Why I meet you here?

263
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,374
It's a high-class restaurant
no business talks!

264
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,510
Take it easy, it's my job...

265
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,382
wouldn't it be good to have a lady?

266
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,521
It doesn't matter
you can't finish the case

267
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,320
And you won't be fired because of this

268
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,564
Hey, miss, shut up!

269
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,063
What would you like?

270
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,427
Fried squid with rice

271
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,733
Fried squid with rice, quick

272
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,638
OK!

273
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,241
What do you want?

274
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,873
Nothing, just wanna make fun with you!

275
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,484
I'm sorry about yesterday!

276
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,416
Don't say it again!

277
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,990
I won't tell you anything
about yesterday!

278
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,492
Inspector Lau!

279
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:47,360
Stop talking, and stop seducing me!

280
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,300
I know nothing about yesterday's case!

281
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,506
Well, you know nothing
about yesterday's case

282
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,510
What about in the lift
and outside the court?

283
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:03,742
You've been investigating
can't say I don't know

284
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,007
We have clues on these two

285
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,585
I know the dead was a man
the killer was a man too

286
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,713
No more jokes!

287
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,481
I have finished!

288
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,559
Miss, I can't tell you anymore!

289
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,356
I need to have my meal, please!

290
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,126
I'll go
if you will give me some information!

291
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,565
Are you going to sit here for life?

292
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,726
Well, I'm here with you today!

293
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:29,236
Why me? So many officers in the station!

294
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,900
News, news, go home rest!

295
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:36,846
Be cool
I've never met such a bitch like you!

296
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,142
Be careful, no one wants you!

297
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,471
Taste good!

298
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,278
He is Kam Ta Fu
an ex-soldier from Vietnam

299
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,083
He became a killer in Thailand
very dangerous

300
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,420
Any news about him?

301
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,522
I heard that he had come to Hong Kong!

302
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,288
Our informer said he had met Or Wing Fu

303
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,464
It's better to catch him!

304
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,360
How can we?

305
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,198
We have no proof, it will alert them!

306
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,226
You

307
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,601
I think he's right!

308
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,335
He is a trouble maker

309
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,001
Send someone to keep an eye on Kam Ta Fu

310
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,109
Stop, police!

311
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,123
No, don't shoot!

312
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,184
Fire!

313
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,655
Don't shoot!

314
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,229
Shoot, it's an order!

315
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,927
Don't shoot! Don't!

316
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:44,794
Watch the time!

317
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,463
I give you one minute!

318
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,997
Yuen Licky, what are you doing?
Don't move. I ask you

319
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,609
do you know Kam Ta Fu came to kill me?

320
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,134
You tell me the truth!

321
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,471
Man is dead, you are the only one left

322
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,312
Why should I kill you?

323
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,510
Then who wants me dead?

324
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,279
Yuen Lick, I don't know!

325
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,790
But I can find out!

326
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,892
You have 30 seconds

327
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:15,092
I will kill you myself if I want

328
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,963
because you won't be alert!

329
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,009
Think, do I have a reason to kill you?

330
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,682
Leave it all up to me!

331
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,411
I know who dares

332
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:48,064
I am going to Thailand

333
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,561
When are you coming back?

334
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,164
I don't know yet

335
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,597
Do you know Kam Ta Fu?

336
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,700
I don't!

337
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,508
You really don't?

338
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:08,448
I haven't even heard about the name!

339
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:13,186
Really, that's strange!

340
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,724
What do you mean?

341
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,697
Don't have to go around circles

342
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:25,760
Boss, I hire Yuen Lick to be a killer

343
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,400
Only you and I know about it

344
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,737
He nearly got killed two days ago

345
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,243
That killer was Kam Ta Fu!

346
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,879
He met you after arriving at Hong Kong

347
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,944
So you two know each other

348
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:45,151
Why do you want to kill Yuen Lick?

349
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:52,463
Because he knows too much!
You mean...

350
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,897
To kill them all!

351
00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:00,495
I don't wanna leave any trace this time

352
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:05,002
I wanna kill those who know about me!

353
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,938
What about me?

354
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,710
You think it over!

355
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,515
First done, first win!

356
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,596
It's me, where does dad stay
in Thailand?

357
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,572
I wanna stay with him
in Thailand next week!

358
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,834
He didn't say!

359
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:40,499
Well, then, bye!

360
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,845
You told me dad had gone to Thailand

361
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,419
He didn't ring after this long!

362
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,153
You two are good friends

363
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,793
I thought dad would contact you!

364
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,463
Right, I remember!

365
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,293
After the rushes that day
he went to the airport

366
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,494
He said he would go to Korea
after Thailand!

367
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,198
What to do in Korea?

368
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:12,570
My dear, would you stop asking?

369
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,305
Well, I say for Jin-seng in Korea

370
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,348
It's up to you to believe!

371
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,642
Come with me!

372
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,649
Where to?

373
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,811
To the studio!

374
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:28,422
I have to keep an eye on the shooting!

375
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,487
Let's go!

376
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:35,791
Tighter!

377
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,728
Be careful, be good if only one time!

378
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,205
Don't worry, no problem!

379
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,034
Ready, camera!

380
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,839
The water stings!

381
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,244
Get up and come out

382
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,471
All right

383
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,182
Let me introduce!

384
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,516
She's my friend's daughter Or Pui Lam!

385
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,921
You should know!

386
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,721
He's our effect specialist, Yuen Lick!

387
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:38,854
He's brilliant

388
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,591
Hi Hi

389
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,631
Seems that we have met?

390
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:46,396
Well, I see you on TV

391
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,297
Pui Lam, let me show you over there!
Good!

392
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,303
Let's go

393
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:56,179
We built an old street set over there!

394
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,143
I show you over there!

395
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,326
How does that gas smell?

396
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,460
Hard to describe
I have never smelt that!

397
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,266
What's the feeling after smelling?

398
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,737
Feel fainted and wanna throw up!

399
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,806
And what else?

400
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,170
Feel painful on the chest!

401
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,107
Can you tell me how it happened?

402
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:33,010
We smelt it in class!

403
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,210
Do you know where the gas came from?

404
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,615
I don't!

405
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,746
How many pupils are in hospital?

406
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,423
All P.5 pupils!

407
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,189
Some strange gas affected Luther School

408
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:52,496
Pupils felt sick
in the middle of their lesson

409
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,265
The pupils are in hospital
for treatment!

410
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,309
It's the 3rd time
pupils struck by strange gas...

411
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,276
authority has no clue
of where the gas comes from

412
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,248
Or Pui Lam, ATV news!

413
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,021
The wind direction
was southern yesterday

414
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,254
Thanks!

415
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,335
As shown on the map...

416
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,338
the gas could come from
the south side of the school

417
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,602
Let's try to find out!

418
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,618
Still smoking, you may get lung cancer

419
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,452
So smoky!

420
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,789
Yeah, it comes from above!

421
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,588
Go in and have a look! OK

422
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:56,863
Quick!

423
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:08,001
Let's go over there!

424
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:12,980
My lady, let's stop
it has been more than ten!

425
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,212
You think I am a dog?
Smell the toxic gas!

426
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,084
It's been a hard day
I buy you some lunch?

427
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,789
Thanks!

428
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,788
No thanks, we have to go on after lunch!

429
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,794
Well, you go by yourself!

430
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,865
I have to attend
my father's celebration!

431
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,138
I had talked to you clearly on the phone

432
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,011
About the lab report on toxic gas

433
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:51,520
it's official report, I can't tell you!

434
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,585
Uncle Ng, let me see it
for the sake of public!

435
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,988
I am a civil servant

436
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,289
I have to obey the law

437
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,629
I have to be loyal!

438
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,729
You want me to be sent to jail!

439
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,774
Uncle Ng, do me a favour?

440
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,171
No!

441
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:18,071
Civil servants
can't reveal any confidential

442
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:23,982
Keep an eye on the document
I'll be back!

443
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,214
I'll be back soon!

444
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,923
Don't mess up the document

445
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,285
I know!

446
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,657
I'll be back soon!

447
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,728
Thanks!

448
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,925
How dare you?

449
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,458
Taking pictures of official document!

450
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,757
You know it's a crime!

451
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,667
You fool! We're all responsible!

452
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,738
Why don't you keep an eye on her?

453
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,001
You supervise her
when she does her assignments

454
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,373
You can leave!

455
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,239
Let's knock off?

456
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,340
Bye!

457
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:41,162
What's the matter, can't you drive?

458
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,495
It's hard to get a taxi!

459
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,430
I give you a ride!

460
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,597
What's up? Don't you know me?

461
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,468
Oh, it's you!

462
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,335
Hop in!

463
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,264
Thanks, but no!

464
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,910
I'm not passing by
I come to pick you up!

465
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,142
The reason is simple
I want to make friend with you!

466
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,417
It's embarrassing!

467
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,612
I'll give you time to think

468
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,405
Hop in!

469
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,473
Do you like Vietnamese food?

470
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:30,411
Yes!

471
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,244
Do you know which one is the best?

472
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,409
I don't know!

473
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,714
I show you!

474
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,116
OK

475
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:46,493
Take a seat!

476
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,616
Well, here is the one you've mentioned

477
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,225
Where's the menu?

478
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,193
I'm not sure if the food is good here

479
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,703
I don't like the way they serve!

480
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:31,936
Really, I like woman like you
who can talk!

481
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,635
I show you here
because you're my good friend!

482
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,109
But I don't think you're my good friend!

483
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,481
You'll change in the future!

484
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,351
What have you got to make me change?

485
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:49,382
I'm alone in Hong Kong, living dull!

486
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,458
I see you on TV every night

487
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,064
I treat you like a relative!

488
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,467
So, I want to make friend with you!

489
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,647
Have some more!

490
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:24,425
Not bad!

491
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,960
Very nice!

492
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,231
Can you tell me what you did in Vietnam?

493
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:35,129
Relax, I wasn't a pimp!

494
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,943
What else do you wanna know?

495
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,746
I want to know nothing!

496
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,241
Why are you so narrow-minded?

497
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,385
So?

498
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,888
Then you must be bad-tempered!

499
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,950
Well, thanks for the meal!

500
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,040
How can you be a reporter
you're so hot-tempered?

501
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,370
Everybody has secrets

502
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:21,978
It's better not telling than lying!

503
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,711
Disgusting!

504
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,921
I go to see a friend
in the refugee camp tomorrow

505
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,289
I think you are interested

506
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,554
Smell good

507
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,220
They seem to be happy!

508
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,764
But they have their tragedy

509
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:11,061
Some have lost their parents
some their kids

510
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,204
Everyone leaves home
they can never return

511
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,000
Just like me!

512
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,138
My parents had divorced for years

513
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,542
I went to the USA with mum
when I was young

514
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:27,879
I came back
after finishing TV news course

515
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,882
I have never lived with my dad!

516
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,283
When I was in College

517
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,051
I saw the anti-Vietnamese War
student movement

518
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,557
Did you think about Vietnam?

519
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:44,259
Yes, it's like a nightmare in Vietnam!

520
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,100
I feel that the war isn't over

521
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:56,674
I don't feel the killing, the death!

522
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:02,346
My only hope is

523
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,817
to get my family out!

524
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,052
Let me up...

525
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,254
Don't run!

526
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:23,560
I won't kill surrenders!

527
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,194
Yuen Lick, let me up! Don't run

528
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,267
Come up, we will treat you right!

529
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:26,685
Who is it?

530
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,664
What? Scared?

531
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,268
Of course, you shit stirrer, come in!

532
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,008
You're insane!

533
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,003
You're good, don't have to work

534
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,242
I'm very tired in the studio

535
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,181
For you!

536
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,420
The director must be a maniac!

537
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:56,017
That Fenny yells in front of me!

538
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,583
She said you hide from her

539
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,797
I don't have time to be with her!

540
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,795
That silly girl, I don't know what to do

541
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:08,230
The captain Kam Ta Fu in Vietnam

542
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:09,896
has come to Hong Kong lately

543
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,902
I heard that
he is a professional killer!

544
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,841
Right, you had confronted him?

545
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,108
Be careful!

546
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:28,484
Help!

547
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,059
Be quick!

548
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,222
Why so careless!

549
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,526
Licky, are you alright?

550
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,894
Get up first!

551
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:44,799
Are you OK?

552
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:45,667
I'm fine!

553
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,503
Hey, take it over there!

554
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,036
Come and give me a hand

555
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,244
Licky, have some water!

556
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,945
Give me

557
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,347
How do you feel?

558
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,483
Take a rest, are you alright?

559
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,959
I had told you not to do the stunts!

560
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,821
It doesn't make a lot more money

561
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,657
Shut up, will you?

562
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,701
What's the matter with you?

563
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:13,803
What do you mean?

564
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,231
You've changed lately!

565
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,240
You wouldn't treat me like this before

566
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,370
Stop!

567
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,249
I know, you must have a new girl friend

568
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,445
Leave me alone!

569
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:36,183
Who do you think I am? Make it clear!

570
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,389
Fenny! Leave him alone first

571
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,965
None of your business
if you don't clear it

572
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,331
We split up, say it!

573
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,070
They really split up!

574
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,016
Ride me home

575
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,517
What are you doing?

576
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,259
No!

577
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,394
No!

578
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,955
What is it?

579
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,565
No!

580
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,902
Licky, listen!

581
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,768
My man had killed your girl!

582
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,938
Come see me at Mt. Devil
if you wanna revenge

583
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:19,448
Are you a beast?

584
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,650
Fenny was good to you
why did you do it?

585
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:22,658
I had no choice!

586
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:23,716
Call the police!

587
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,522
I can't!

588
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,121
Why can't, tell me!

589
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,195
Don't ask me if you are my pal!

590
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,096
Why?

591
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,007
Listen!

592
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,670
I have to execute Fenny's killer!

593
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:55,253
That Yuen Lick may not dare to come!

594
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,295
Wait, wait!

595
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,601
Shoot!

596
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,438
What do you want?

597
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,171
Is my dad really in Korea?

598
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,647
I haven't heard from him since he's gone

599
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,576
Right, has he contacted you?

600
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:02,781
We planned to meet in Korea!

601
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:06,353
But I was busy, so I stayed

602
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:11,458
I guess he must be happy there!

603
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,265
Relax, take a seat!

604
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,167
OK!

605
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:42,555
You stupid fool, I'll kill you!

606
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,396
Can you hear me?

607
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,606
Miss Or?

608
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:01,378
Yes, I am!

609
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,212
I am Kenny, Yuen Lick's friend!

610
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:07,452
Well, I don't know where to start

611
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,720
Yuen Lick got the news from Vietnam

612
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:12,157
saying his family

613
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:15,560
got blown up
when sneaking out of Vietnam!

614
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,862
His heart was broken after hearing it

615
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,968
He doesn't eat nor sleep
better go to see him!

616
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,499
OK, let's go!

617
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,880
Licky!

618
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,799
Good son

619
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,699
Brother I'll get you to Hong Kong!

620
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,215
I came to Hong Kong alone!

621
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:18,022
I risked my life to make money

622
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,658
only want to get my family out

623
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:46,789
I did what I didn't like for them!

624
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,455
But, so what!

625
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,160
It's all been wasted!

626
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,094
Do you know it?

627
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,260
Licky!

628
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:54,283
Pretty little girl, get up early

629
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:59,080
take a basket to the market

630
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,372
Why didn't you knock first?

631
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,031
Boss, it's bad!

632
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,332
What's the matter?

633
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,968
Old Or's body was found in Lung Har Bay

634
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,014
No, you can't go back to Vietnam!

635
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,211
Why not?

636
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,085
Think about it
your family is no longer there

637
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,315
What do you do going back?

638
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:36,254
You have no reason going back!

639
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:39,090
You don't understand
I feel real bad lately!

640
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,686
I know you feel sad!

641
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,630
You won't feel good even if you return!

642
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:43,893
You don't have to say anymore!

643
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,367
I won't let you go
no matter what you say

644
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:58,047
My dad, how could it be?

645
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,048
Where?

646
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,894
What happened...?

647
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,633
My dad is dead

648
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,345
He was found in Lung Har Bay!

649
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:36,943
What's your dad's name?

650
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,216
Or Wing Fu!

651
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,051
Well, what a coincidence!

652
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,720
You date with Old Or's daughter

653
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,867
Why do you want me here?

654
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:31,737
Or Pui Lam is smart, she'll suspect me!

655
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:35,901
You know what to do?

656
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:40,275
You don't have to say, I won't do it

657
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,947
It's my order, no negotiation!

658
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,256
She's a famous reporter
it's worse killing her

659
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,893
I tried so hard to escape from Vietnam

660
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:02,497
I'm in Hong Kong at last, but a killer

661
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,066
I don't wanna kill anymore

662
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:11,441
I'm tired, too tired!

663
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,183
Don't pretend in front of me

664
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:19,786
She'll know you killed her father

665
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,322
You can't be emotional

666
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:25,289
We can't let go of her!

667
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,558
I beg you, let her go!

668
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:34,198
Remember, once a killer
always a killer!

669
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,201
You think it over!

670
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:03,829
Ready?

671
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,160
Not yet! Longer

672
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:08,994
Ready?

673
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,005
OK

674
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:14,266
Listen! Two cameras, ready!

675
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,410
Bring it over there! Get ready!

676
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,448
Go away, a real take!

677
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,681
Ready, real take!

678
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,623
Camera!

679
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,631
Cut!

680
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,266
What's the matter, come out so soon!

681
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,697
You can't concentrate
drive faster later!

682
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:48,934
You come out slowly, understand?

683
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:49,974
Understand!

684
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,243
Again!

685
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,021
Are you ready? Quick

686
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,162
Are you ready? Yes!

687
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:07,990
Real take!

688
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,258
Ready, camera!

689
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,335
How is Yuen Lick?

690
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,494
How did he get hurt, tell me!

691
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,232
I, I don't know!

692
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:54,633
Doctor!

693
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,812
Doctor!

694
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,846
Doc, how is Yuen Lick?

695
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,747
Don't worry, he only got burnt slightly!

696
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:06,016
We have to observe him for a period

697
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:09,056
According to my experience
he'll soon recover

698
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,258
That's good!

699
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,866
Why were you so careless?

700
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,728
Someone wanted to trap me!

701
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,499
I must find him out!

702
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,736
How do you feel?

703
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:29,741
What did the doctor say?

704
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,471
You'll soon recover!

705
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:35,878
I don't wanna disturb

706
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,686
I go first!

707
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:50,027
Help him, go first!

708
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,157
Run! Come!

709
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,225
Run quickly!

710
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,366
Be careful

711
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,397
Some more?

712
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:37,996
No, enough!

713
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,602
Why did he want to kill you?

714
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,774
Maybe I have killed too much!

715
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,943
You were in the war, it's different now

716
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,687
The war will never end

717
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,124
You're useless! Licky is recovering!

718
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:11,035
You ask for money
leaving no marks on him

719
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,035
Mr. Tang, you can't blame me

720
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:19,442
The powder in the studio is old!

721
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:24,176
And he reacts promptly, he alerts!

722
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:28,546
I have an idea
he and Kam Ta Fu are enemies

723
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:35,095
We can use Kam Ta Fu's hand to kill him!

724
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,423
Make them kill one another

725
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,492
What do you think of my idea?

726
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,465
Is it good?

727
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,300
Good!

728
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,470
Let's do it!

729
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,290
Licky!

730
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,300
What are you doing, come, have a tea!

731
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,405
Good!

732
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:37,151
After your recovery
I apply for a holiday leave

733
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,490
We go for a trip!

734
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,994
We go to the USA
to see my mum on the way!

735
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,825
She wrote that she wanted to meet you

736
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,052
Pui Lam!

737
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,822
I have to go out!

738
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,860
Where are you going?

739
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:54,228
Just for a walk, be back soon!

740
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,055
Haven't seen you for long!

741
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,216
Where had you been?

742
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:27,421
For recovery!

743
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,729
Recovered?

744
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:36,194
Well, what's the matter?

745
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,769
About Or Pui Lam, let her go!

746
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,812
You're protecting her
do you wanna go against me?

747
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:44,901
Yes!

748
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,549
Why don't you wanna kill her?

749
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:58,325
Killing is an easy job for you, why?

750
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,928
It's different if killing my love one

751
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:07,834
It's right time for you to be here!

752
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,938
What you wanna do, Tang Kin?

753
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,004
You'd better leave!

754
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,544
I can kill you even if you fire first!

755
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,437
Try it if you suspect

756
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:25,086
Yuen Lick
you can't hide what you've done

757
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,312
It's no use!

758
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:31,223
She'd know you killed her father!

759
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,687
Is he telling the truth?

760
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:39,896
Tell me...!

761
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:49,273
Yes, but I didn't know he was your dad!

762
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:55,840
I don't believe it!

763
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,343
Pui Lam!

764
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:10,979
You are bad luck, you just walked in!

765
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,247
Now I send you to your father

766
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,112
No!

767
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:17,014
Pui Lam, don't come out!

768
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,260
Licky!

769
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,644
You know too much!

770
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:03,717
No!

771
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,978
Licky!

772
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:32,085
Why you won't let me go?

773
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,919
Don't cry, deliver it for me!

774
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:14,719
I don't have to kill anymore!

775
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,569
Bye!

776
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,228
Come in!

777
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:57,998
Grand-mum!

778
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:05,408
Your grandson asked Licky
to give you the money!

779
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,343
Thank you!

780
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:12,920
Where is Man, when is he coming back?

781
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:14,112
I don't know!

782
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:23,697
What about Licky? When is he coming?

783
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:31,064
He will never come!
