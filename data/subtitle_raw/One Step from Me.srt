1
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,070
What’s the true meaning of inner peace?

2
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,530
Is it perhaps being
successful in our projects?

3
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,450
Or is it overcoming a phase of pain?

4
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,920
Maybe it is to understand that
every single second of life matters.

5
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,710
Yes, I know, it sounds cheesy, childish.

6
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,270
Fortunately, that's how it is.

7
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,660
There aren’t bad moments.
There are only moments.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,410
And those moments define our future.

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,090
However, ten days ago I was
feeling like there is no future at all…

10
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,440
But my life was about to change.

11
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Is that all?

12
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,950
Tatiana? Is this all?

13
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,529
Yes, Mr. Juan Carlos. You know, I’ve had
troubles finding resources about this topic.

14
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,529
No, Tatiana.

15
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,639
I’m sorry, but you got plenty of time to do this.
I don’t see anything good or clear on these papers.

16
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,379
Well Mr. Juan Carlos, I have been
researching, trying to get more sources...

17
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,449
I don’t want to talk just from my perspective.
I don’t want to reach just sources...

18
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:52,010
You are not being asked to do a microbiological
study of the origin of life, Tatiana.

19
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,180
The topic is “Inner Peace”

20
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,200
It’s really simple.
Nothing complex.

21
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,399
You don’t need many
sources. Everything is here.

22
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,240
The thing I’m missing here
is your personal branding.

23
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,740
We need five writings,
we can't start like this.

24
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,800
Well, I know it is very personal.
I haven’t found arguments…

25
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,610
- I’m delayed, yes.
- Alright.

26
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,030
How much time do you need?

27
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,870
- Twenty days, maybe.
- Twenty days?

28
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,849
There are just five writings, you
must upload a writing every two days.

29
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,199
We should have this entire
blog finished in ten days.

30
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,820
At this speed, we are
not going to achieve it.

31
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,910
Well, I thought I got the
same time as Alex to finish it.

32
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:53,549
Do you know how many curriculums
from journalists, we daily receive here?

33
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,390
Some of them maybe would
have finished this by now.

34
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,109
Yes Sir, I know.

35
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,090
No, Tatiana. You don’t know it.

36
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,470
If you would know that, I would
have three writings at least by now.

37
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,589
Well, Mr. Juan Carlos,
I’m sure you understand.

38
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,149
But, this is not as simple as it sounds.
There are different approaches to this topic.

39
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,849
For example, we can talk about
peace of mind, serenity, inner peace…

40
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,489
It is a social complex meaning,
actually, it is a personal topic too.

41
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,000
Tati?

42
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,299
Are you listening to yourself?

43
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,550
Please listen to me carefully.

44
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,970
Isn't the content that worries me. Is
the lack of your personal branding.

45
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:49,600
This thing I’m reading could be written by a student.
A good one, to be honest. But it isn’t enough.

46
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,960
Do you know what
happened last week?

47
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,500
People are getting fired. Do you
want to bring us into that situation?

48
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,200
No, of course not.

49
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,540
In the past, you
proposed projects, ideas.

50
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,040
You used to finish your
writings before the due date.

51
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
What happened Tati?

52
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,430
What is going on?

53
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,860
It has been a
very difficult month.

54
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
I’m stressed.

55
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:37,129
Mr. Juan Carlos, I’m sorry, you
should be the last person to know this.

56
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,130
I know.

57
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,990
We all go through these things.

58
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,440
But Tati… I must finish my
duties. I must do my job.

59
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:56,100
I can’t risk the results because you are
not in the mood, or depressed. I just can’t.

60
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,590
Ten days.

61
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,170
You’ll have the
entire blog in ten days.

62
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,570
I don’t want to be
the villain of this story.

63
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,040
This is my offer.

64
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:22,020
You will go to your home.
You’ll focus on this blog.

65
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,700
And you’re going to
send over the writings.

66
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
That said.

67
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,350
I want to feel your
personal branding.

68
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,310
I want to listen to you. I
want to read your DNA.

69
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,020
I know how you feel
about your father’s death.

70
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,770
But, life goes on.

71
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,210
Ten days.

72
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,410
Focus on experiences.

73
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:06,270
Make a map of content. But please, take
a look of the tools people use to be happy.

74
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,089
But the most important thing…

75
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,100
Be yourself. That’s
the ingredient I need.

76
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,970
I don’t know where it is.

77
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,550
Then find it. Please do it.

78
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,089
Because.

79
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,090
This is not you.

80
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,470
Spit it out.

81
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,679
What?

82
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,190
Marisol must upload that today.
On social networks of course.

83
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,860
Well, someone else please take
that role, just take the damn computer.

84
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:52,400
What are you telling me? Can’t you do your job? I
can’t solve everyone’s troubles, come on Lorena.

85
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,519
That’s your responsibility.

86
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,610
Alright, then let’s
fire her. I don’t care…

87
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,180
- Hi daughter, the plane just
landed. Let's talk tomorrow -

88
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,530
Alright mom, good luck with the shopping.

89
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,480
Please stop calling me, Alonso.

90
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,320
No, Alonso. I already told you.

91
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Are you listening to yourself?

92
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Is it my fault, then?

93
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,360
Despite ruining everything,
now you want me to get fired.

94
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,290
I’m almost there!

95
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,159
What an asshole!

96
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,100
I can’t believe he talks to you
like you were the one who failed.

97
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,179
But.

98
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,590
The important thing is that
you told him to stop calling you.

99
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,610
Rachel!

100
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,250
When everything got so bad?

101
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,700
This is life. I hate
when it happens.

102
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,230
Is really weird.

103
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,860
Like nothing makes sense.

104
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,370
For some time now,
nothing works for me.

105
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,570
First, my dad.

106
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,040
My mom is not
even in the country.

107
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,460
Now, Alonso.

108
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,560
My job.

109
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,610
I’m very stressed about my job.

110
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,990
I don’t get promoted.

111
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,020
Now they ask me to write
a blog about inner peace.

112
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,940
Inner peace? Seriously?

113
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,980
Do you remember Marcela?

114
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,999
So much I criticized
her. Now I am worse.

115
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,670
Don’t compare to her.

116
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,900
You have your life in front
of you. You’re just stressed.

117
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,730
I mean, you can feel sad.

118
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,910
I know your dad was a very special
person and that makes you feel bad.

119
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,519
But it’s been over a year.

120
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
What have you done to move on?

121
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,910
Alonso? Let’s not
talk! He's an asshole.

122
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,739
You are a beautiful
professional intelligent girl.

123
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,620
He is a jerk!

124
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,150
You can go out to exercise,
go to eat, go to the movies.

125
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,850
To the movies?

126
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,790
By myself?

127
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Isn’t just that!

128
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,490
I can’t do those things alone!

129
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,260
I used to do everything with
Alonso. With daddy. Even with you.

130
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,040
For how long we haven’t
hung out the two of us?

131
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,820
I know you're very
busy, believe me, I know.

132
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,570
But I can’t do those
things just by myself.

133
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,869
You've always needed
someone to do things with.

134
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,910
You have to learn to
do things by yourself.

135
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,220
Without depending
on anyone else.

136
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,349
I really would like to spend more time with you.
But my mom needs me, and I have to work too.

137
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,510
No. I’m sorry
Raquel. What a baby!

138
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,879
Why don’t you spend this time
doing things you've never done before?

139
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,640
- You are home working, that’s amazing.
- Have you lost your mind?

140
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,040
I shouldn't be home working.

141
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,450
- What am I supposed to do here all day?
- You’re confused!

142
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,660
You need time for yourself.

143
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,000
Without thinking about
Alonso and nobody else.

144
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,360
You can go to the beach, to
different places, get some air.

145
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,980
Rachel? Seriously!

146
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
What is going on with you?

147
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:24,269
I can’t go anywhere, I must
finish the blog in less than a week.

148
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,270
And how is that going?

149
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,019
I've seen you writing over
30 pages in less than a day.

150
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,450
You perfectly can go to the beach, get some
rest, and then you just write it in one day.

151
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,760
- I don’t even have a car.
- You can rent one.

152
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,730
I’ll be back.

153
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
You should eat something.

154
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,570
Tati, everything is
going to be alright.

155
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,309
Rachel, I can't go
right now to any place.

156
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,740
And I never thought we could be friends,
and look at all the years we have been.

157
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,540
I’m going to prepare the food.

158
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:23,479
So, I proposed some ideas,
very crazy, my mind was exploiting.

159
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,870
I was inspired.

160
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,840
I calmed down and I presented
to them. I was nervous.

161
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,250
One of the CEOs was
there, but I was prepared.

162
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:41,200
Then, he asked me how we would save money, especially
with all the taxes and expenses, you know...

163
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,970
So, I breathed for a bit.
And I explained to him.

164
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,910
So?

165
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,330
Well...

166
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,909
You, my children, are looking at the
youngest and handsome manager of the company.

167
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,910
Thank you very much!

168
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:58,340
- Congratulations!
- Great news!

169
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,760
- That’s really good! Ah?
- I think so! You as always!

170
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Alright, so now…

171
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,830
How did this thing happen?

172
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,039
I was at the Pet Shop.

173
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,249
And, there it was this cute cat.

174
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,250
Suddenly it said “daddy”

175
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,670
You know Nati loves cats.

176
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,490
She has one actually.

177
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,510
Obviously, I adopted it.

178
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,050
Instead of the plate of the
necklace, I replaced it with the ring.

179
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,120
I knocked on the
door, she opened it…

180
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,470
And she fell in
love with the cat.

181
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,750
But she didn’t notice the ring. So,
she held the cat like the “Lion King”...

182
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,579
So, she noticed the
ring, I knelt down.

183
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
And, I proposed.

184
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Look, girls!

185
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:55,139
It was amazing, I held the cat. It was really
romantic because I didn’t notice the ring first.

186
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,839
Franco was on his knees,
and I said “Yes”... Then I cried.

187
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,290
Rockstar!

188
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,610
It was the best thing ever.

189
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,670
- Guys get a room!
- Stop!

190
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,750
- What happens?
- Where is the cat?

191
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,540
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

192
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,070
Happy birthday dear
Franco! Happy birthday to you!

193
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
Congratulations, Franco!

194
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,639
So. Who is going to
watch the game with me?

195
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,409
What the hell is with the national
team? Always the same players.

196
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,149
Don’t talk about it, because you’re
going to be the first one at the game.

197
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,799
- She has some pants!
- Well, she's right.

198
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,000
I’m patriotic, I love to sing the
National anthem at the game.

199
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,620
Come on, dude! Didn't you
check the list of the players?

200
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,740
I don’t care who they called.
Alright, I don’t like the players but…

201
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,839
- I’m going to get a drink.
- Are you alright?

202
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,400
Totally.

203
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,150
- Well I’m going to join you.
- Great! We can do the “cha-cha” together.

204
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,809
- Thanks guys, have a good night.
- Thanks for coming!

205
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,600
- Congratulations Franco!
- Thank you for the party.

206
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,460
- Don't you want me to stay over?
- No, no, I’m alright.

207
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
- Sure?
- Totally.

208
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,149
They are a nice couple.

209
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,750
Well, yes. It's time.
Two years together.

210
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,750
I'm so jealous.

211
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,310
I'm so far from that.

212
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Are you still with that?

213
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,500
I already told you, Alonso
wasn’t the right one.

214
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Please get over it.

215
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,870
You have everything
in front of you.

216
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,909
Why don’t you rent a car
and take a little vacation?

217
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,680
Relax your mind and
clear your thoughts.

218
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,240
Maybe you can find something
you weren't looking for.

219
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,690
Anyway…

220
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,649
I must go, otherwise,
the guys will leave me.

221
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,650
Thank you very much!

222
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,359
- Are you sure you’re going to be ok?
- I’m sure!

223
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Just go, or you will
have to call a taxi.

224
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Oh, dad!

225
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,580
What should I do?

226
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
So many memories.

227
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,339
- Pardon me! Did I know you?
- No until today.

228
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,720
But, I was a great
friend of your dad.

229
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,039
Well, I’m a good
friend of your dad.

230
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,870
How did you know him?

231
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,860
Before you were born, your dad
and I worked in a shoe factory.

232
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
We made the best shoes.

233
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,290
We weren’t more than just
two employers without study.

234
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
But, we really
enjoyed that time.

235
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,750
However, you want to know
what was the worst thing about it?

236
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,830
We made the shoes, but we never saw
the faces of the people who bought them.

237
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,880
Their happiness of buying
a brand new pair of shoes.

238
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,360
Or the anger for paying
more than they were used to.

239
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,970
It was a great time.

240
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
I'm really sorry!

241
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
He never mentioned you.

242
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,560
Your father had
amazing thinking of life.

243
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:36,000
He used to say that moments are in
the present and they remain there forever.

244
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
I never understood that.

245
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:47,080
I think he tried to say that we
should take time for ourselves…

246
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,000
You know, without people we
actually don’t need in our lives.

247
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,430
That phrase! Very common.

248
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
Rogelio! Nice to meet you.

249
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,750
- Tatiana!
- Yes, I know.

250
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,500
He always loved that name.

251
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,580
I used to tell him “Gertrudis”
was better, but he never went for it.

252
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,000
- I rather prefer Tatiana.

253
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,830
And I ended up
married to "Gertrudis".

254
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,479
How is Maria?

255
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,120
She's fine.

256
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,400
She is traveling a lot to
the States for business.

257
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,370
But...

258
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,639
I can’t help her
the way I’d like to.

259
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
I’m stuck to my work every day.

260
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,799
Honestly, I don’t know why.

261
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,500
By the way. What do you
meant by “that phrase”?

262
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260
It's nothing.

263
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:57,040
Lately, I’ve been feeling
stressed and lost in a way.

264
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,290
You’re the third person this
week who have told me that.

265
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,500
I didn’t say that,
your father did.

266
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:12,360
We think too much about
what others would say about us.

267
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
We’re attached to everyone.

268
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:22,350
That's illogical, because
real peace depends on us.

269
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:30,190
Nothing and nobody
can ruin your happiness.

270
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,550
Life is...

271
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,590
Life is a celebration of love.

272
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,490
Alright?

273
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,419
Alright!

274
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,219
- Thank you very much, Mr. Rogelio.
- Just Rogelio.

275
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,710
Look.

276
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,790
This is for you.

277
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,430
This rubber is from the first pair
of shoes your father and I made.

278
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:56,820
I think it is time to leave
the closet it was hidden in.

279
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,850
The happiest moments...

280
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,410
come from the best memories.

281
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
So nice!

282
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,660
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

283
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
Mr. Rogelio?

284
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,520
What would you do?

285
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,330
I simply would do it.

286
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,390
- You're right mom, thanks.

287
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,630
Rachel?

288
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,850
Guess what?

289
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,400
Yes!

290
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,929
I decided. I need to get
some fresh air. Totally.

291
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,930
You're absolutely right.

292
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,240
I know.

293
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,250
All these years doing everything for
everyone without thinking about me.

294
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,580
My mom. My family.

295
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
My friends. Alonso.

296
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,000
I forgot about myself.
You’re totally right about this.

297
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,189
So ironic.

298
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,940
All these years writing and writing stories
for everyone, but I haven’t lived for myself.

299
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,470
Exactly.

300
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,500
I know, I sound very dramatic.

301
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,019
But I’ll do it.

302
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,730
I’m about to purchase it.

303
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,469
I'll let you know.

304
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,890
Bye!

305
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,790
- Seven days then?
- Yes!

306
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,120
Alright, I need your
driving license, please.

307
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,480
Mr. Juan Carlos?

308
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,130
How are you?

309
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Good, much better. Thank you.

310
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,660
Yes, that's why I'm calling you.

311
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,180
The home working offer.

312
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,070
I'll take it.

313
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,130
Yes, you’re totally
right. I need it.

314
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,200
Alright. You’ll get the
writings every two days.

315
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,660
Thanks!

316
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,180
Alright! We agree on that.

317
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,360
- Are you okay?
- Yes, totally.

318
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,880
Perfect! Let me tell you that
you got the total insurance...

319
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:12,730
That means that your car
and you will be protected...

320
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,110
- Welcome to Wyndham Tamarindo.
- Thanks.

321
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,330
- Reservation?
- Tatiana Valle.

322
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,030
Great, here it is.
Just one person?

323
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
- Yes.
- Alright.

324
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,400
Just let me check you in.

325
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,950
Sometimes we must leave our
comfort zone to find inner peace.

326
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,349
Do I have to go to a beautiful
hotel to leave my comfort zone?

327
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,770
Well...

328
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,990
To me, it is, of course.

329
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,149
Now what?

330
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,160
I wasn't in my comfort zone.

331
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,370
It must be a great story!

332
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,829
Excuse me?

333
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,830
Yeah, the story you’re reading.

334
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,990
Why?

335
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,980
To be reading in the
middle of this paradise.

336
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,760
These are notes.

337
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,020
I’m working on a blog
about inner peace.

338
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
I'm a journalist.

339
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,040
You’re a stranger, I don’t
have anything to explain.

340
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,740
Sorry, my bad. I
was just wondering.

341
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:23,250
Why does someone like you read
instead of being in the pool or something?

342
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,739
- Someone like me?
- I mean you’re pretty, and you’re here...

343
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,240
Do I make myself clear?

344
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,450
Don’t try to fix
it. It's alright.

345
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,360
Where’s your girlfriend?

346
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
No. I’m here by myself.

347
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,690
One of those impulses and...

348
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,830
Here I am.

349
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,249
Really?

350
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,850
Yes, I was looking at Yuplon's
discounts and I found this package.

351
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,540
I took some days off. This
is the third time I do this.

352
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,970
What do you do
on a trip like this?

353
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,120
I mean, besides talking
to the first girl you see.

354
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
No. That hurts!

355
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,750
There are plenty
of things to do.

356
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,670
You can talk to people
you aren't used to talking to.

357
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,049
Everything is better when
you're traveling alone.

358
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:17,909
Don’t you think we are losers and we
just made that thing up to uplift our mood?

359
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,910
Well, that works for me.

360
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,990
What else do you do?

361
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,220
Do you spend your
time at the hotel?

362
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,859
Do you take a tour or what?

363
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,860
Haven't you traveled before?

364
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,590
Well, yes. But, not by myself.

365
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,000
Besides, not inside Costa Rica.

366
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,660
What a star!

367
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,230
Anyway.

368
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,010
You can do tours, or just get
some rest under a palm tree.

369
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,060
Taking the sun, feeling
the breeze of the sea.

370
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,360
There’s so much you can do.

371
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,780
But.

372
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,410
There’s nothing else to do if
you keep behind on a notebook.

373
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Well, maybe.

374
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,560
What's your name?

375
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,999
Rachel.

376
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,600
I'm Jason. Nice to meet you.

377
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,170
How much time are
you going to be here?

378
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,660
Same as yours. I
purchased that offer too.

379
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,020
We're going to keep
seeing each other then.

380
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,789
- I think we do.
- What are you going to do tomorrow?

381
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,540
Honestly, I have plenty of work
to do. I’ll stay here at the hotel.

382
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,419
Maybe I’ll take the
sun, just for a while.

383
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,820
Boring!

384
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,090
I’ll go to the beach tomorrow.
You know this beach, right?

385
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,900
You don’t know this beach.

386
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:46,000
It’s really close to here. We
can meet there by 9:00 am.

387
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,850
Alright.

388
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,049
Let's meet there tomorrow.

389
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,539
Great!

390
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,540
I’ll let you alone…

391
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,190
Because I’m going to seize
this amazing pool we have here.

392
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,230
Hello, Rachel.

393
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,450
It’s been amazing. This
place is beautiful and comfy.

394
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,979
Of course, a little
weird at the beginning.

395
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,500
But, I’m kinda getting this.

396
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,220
Yes, I’ll let you know.

397
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,570
Thanks for calling.

398
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,080
Good night!

399
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,960
This is beautiful.

400
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,890
See.

401
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,050
I told you.

402
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:15,050
I’ve seen some photos of this
place. But, it’s never the same.

403
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,380
I feel a tremendous peace
every time I come here.

404
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,360
There's nothing like this.

405
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:30,450
I don’t get why you people take a plane
instead of traveling your country first.

406
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,220
I'm on top of the list.

407
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,910
May I see it?

408
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,860
- Outstanding photo - Thank you.

409
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,420
Why don’t you use
your eyes this time?

410
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,570
We pull out our phones every
time we watch something beautiful.

411
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,040
Look.

412
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,060
All this time...

413
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,650
Traveling around the world.

414
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,610
But not where I belong to.

415
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:35,140
Maybe because it is my
first time traveling alone.

416
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,090
Or being with
someone I barely know.

417
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,700
But, I feel a tremendous peace.

418
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,950
What’s the blog about again?

419
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:51,890
It’s about inner peace.

420
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,480
Serenity, mental
peace, that stuff.

421
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,730
I must write from
my point of view.

422
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,190
But, I’m not used
to it. I prefer not to.

423
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,650
I'm used to finding sources,
witnesses, you know.

424
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,480
Inner peace is a decision.

425
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,139
You have it or not.

426
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,140
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

427
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,830
- This blog is not worthed.
- It is not like that.

428
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,840
You can have inner peace
at the worst moments ever…

429
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,709
Or you can lose
it at the best ones.

430
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,210
I should write that down.

431
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
I’m a “source” then.

432
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,830
I must confess something.

433
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,840
My name isn’t Rachel.

434
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,290
I must confess something too.

435
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,190
I knew it.

436
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,639
Now you just know everything.

437
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,640
It was clear that
wasn't your name.

438
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,399
How did you know?

439
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,900
Your name is on the
back of your notebook.

440
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,920
I’m so embarrassed.

441
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,950
Why didn’t you tell me before?

442
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,370
I was waiting for you to do it.

443
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,980
Well, you know my name. Tatiana!

444
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,120
I’m Jason. Glad to meet you.

445
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,580
Should we go now?

446
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,519
Let’s meet at the
hotel in the evening.

447
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,350
- I’ll be here for a while.
- Alright.

448
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,970
The moments by
ourselves are important.

449
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:08,710
Having inner peace means appreciating
every second of life. Doesn’t matter where.

450
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,450
However, a beautiful sunset at
the beach can change everything.

451
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,329
By the way.

452
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,330
You haven´t told me
what do you do in life.

453
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,950
I´m a graphic designer. I
work in a local government.

454
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:36,000
Since I've traveled, these are
the moments that I really enjoy.

455
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:44,349
Don't you think this goes against
all the purposes of our trips?

456
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,060
Why?

457
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,259
I mean...

458
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,140
We are here to
disconnect from the world.

459
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,129
But, we spend the
whole day together.

460
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,130
So I think...

461
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,719
It doesn't make much sense.

462
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,809
Well, one thing is to disconnect from
the world metaphorically speaking...

463
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,830
And the other one is to
literally disconnect from it.

464
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,289
Unless you are going
to a desert island.

465
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,970
Where you don't have any
contact with any human being.

466
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,590
Maybe, not like this either.

467
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
But still.

468
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:29,500
I think in the end, the goal is
to enjoy those moments alone.

469
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,240
Yes...

470
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,470
But I mean away
from our daily lives.

471
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,200
There is a writer who
always talked about it.

472
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:46,260
He said that our worlds
depend on our perspectives.

473
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,540
- I think this has something to do with it.
- Why?

474
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:57,479
Well, because you have a
perspective, very different from mine.

475
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,000
And it is valid. As a matter
of fact, it seems right to me.

476
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,820
I believe, to have a position...

477
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,930
You must live all
possible perspectives.

478
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,730
That's a very deep thought.

479
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:21,000
Excuse me, but I have
to ask you something.

480
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,790
Do you have a boyfriend?

481
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,750
I had one.

482
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,010
I don't want to go into details.
That is precisely why I am here.

483
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,000
Got it.

484
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,360
Now I have to ask you something.

485
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:46,340
And I don't want to sound
childish. That isn't my intention.

486
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,239
What do you want with me?

487
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
Honestly

488
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,780
I think you’re an
incredible person.

489
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,260
As perhaps I have
never met someone.

490
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:06,330
Everything feels so natural.

491
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,730
We can talk about different
topics, nothing is being forced.

492
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,310
Even if I barely have
a day of meeting you.

493
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,420
It seems impossible not to think
about wanting to know you more.

494
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,319
Look, Jason.

495
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,650
The least I can do is start
meeting someone else.

496
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,970
Especially for what
I've been going through.

497
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,080
But I'm not going to lie.
Yes, I’m having a good time.

498
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:46,440
In fact, I never thought to have a conversation
with someone else like y in a long time.

499
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,640
We cannot generalize
all the people for one.

500
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,879
However, it’s good
that you take your time.

501
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,880
As I told you, all good.

502
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:05,269
What are you going to eat?

503
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,270
I don't know yet.

504
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:14,930
I just know the food of
this place is amazing.

505
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,120
They have a delicious
tamarindo sauce.

506
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,000
Unique!

507
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,620
But.

508
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,640
I go to the bathroom for a moment
if you want to check the menu.

509
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,940
Rachel, I'm going to get
out of here. This is stupid!

510
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,670
I don't know what I'm doing here alone. I'm
spending money, I have a lot of work to do.

511
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:36,000
This is not me. Who
Am I trying to cheat?

512
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,140
I met this guy. He's an asshole.

513
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,940
Seriously, Rachel...

514
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,299
I'm out of here.

515
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,660
I'll let you know once
I'm back in the city. Bye.

516
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,889
Don't be such a child,
Tatiana. Seriously!

517
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,379
Please focus on your trip.

518
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,000
You're not going to quit this trip
because of a guy you just met.

519
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:55,929
You didn't make this trip for him,
nor for Alonso, you did it for yourself.

520
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,929
Get it in your head.

521
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:03,920
Take advantage because not everyone has the
means and a job that will allow it as you do.

522
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,260
You're right, Rachel.

523
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,550
I'll let you know
how the trip goes.

524
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,080
What did happen?

525
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,140
Oh, Jason.

526
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,460
I didn't think well.

527
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,220
But what happened?

528
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,119
Nothing. I mean it.

529
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,130
- I don't want to argue right now.
- I am not here to discuss.

530
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,469
I respect that you have left.

531
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:21,000
But, I'd like to know why.

532
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:32,020
I'll be at the lake in case
you want to talk or explain.

533
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,840
I'm not angry or anything.

534
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,550
No worries.

535
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,500
I'd like to apologize if I did
something that made you feel bad.

536
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,700
You told me that I was special.

537
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:34,500
All the story that you had
never met anyone like me.

538
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:38,560
And the first thing I
saw when you leave...

539
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,050
Is a photo of who knows who...

540
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,920
In a bathing suit.

541
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,909
She's Katherine, my sister.

542
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:51,290
She is a model who is doing
some photos for a clothing store.

543
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:55,390
I'm the graphic designer, and she
sent me the photos to make the art.

544
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,180
- Are you serious?
- Yes, she is my sister. That's all.

545
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,610
What a shame!

546
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:13,130
That man left you
traumatized, definitely.

547
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:16,110
Anyway.

548
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:20,030
You got your reasons,
and I respect them.

549
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,420
I can't believe
I'm acting like this.

550
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,100
I think...

551
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:36,950
I really needed this trip
to understand many things.

552
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:39,130
Don't worry!

553
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,030
Forgive me for not having told
you anything about her before.

554
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,220
No, come on. Isn't your fault.

555
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,340
If it helps...

556
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,480
I think it has to do
something with your blog.

557
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:56,180
Leaving our daily lives
and finding ourselves.

558
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:02,980
It is a good opportunity to correct
our mistakes and learn from them.

559
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,670
I asked you for your
intentions with me.

560
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,390
I told you, I don't want
anything with no one.

561
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,230
And I went crazy
because of a photo.

562
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,720
Oh God, that's how crazy I am.

563
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,920
What is for to
connect with nature...

564
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:35,230
To travel, go to the sea,
and try to clear yourself...

565
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:39,180
If we don't connect
to ourselves first.

566
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,459
I don't know how to
talk to you anymore.

567
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,829
For better or for
worse, we are here.

568
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:48,910
We got the same
package. Who cares.

569
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,490
However, something
must be happening.

570
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:58,650
The "me" from the past, wouldn't
have sat here looking for answers.

571
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,780
Things happened to me...

572
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,570
I used to judge people.

573
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,070
I kept people away from me.

574
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,129
As I told you.

575
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:12,280
You've only been around for a
few days and you're seeing changes.

576
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:18,630
I'm sorry, Jason. I mean it.

577
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:22,310
You really have to tell me
what happened with your ex.

578
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,480
No way. I said no.

579
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,320
Although...

580
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,410
You must already be deducing it.

581
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,690
Kinda.

582
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,860
- You owe me a dinner.
- Yes, you're right. I promise.

583
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,580
- Everything okay?
- All good.

584
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,059
We stay here?

585
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,060
Yes, this is nice.

586
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,229
The weather changes
here a lot. Right?

587
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,229
Yes, but it wasn't
too bad either.

588
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:51,230
No, this is amazing.

589
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,330
Peaceful.

590
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:57,040
In fact, you knew this is one of
the cleanest rivers in Costa Rica.

591
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,950
You really don't know
your own country.

592
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,760
You're right. I don't.

593
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,980
- I must go out more often.
- You bet.

594
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,529
Well.

595
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,530
My room is over there.

596
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:20,370
Do you want to go with
me for a walk tomorrow?

597
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,400
Maybe, yes.

598
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,730
Jason, wait.

599
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,959
I must apologize.

600
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,480
I'm sorry I left that night.

601
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,480
I behaved like a child.

602
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,410
In fact, I learned from it.

603
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:43,880
Good night.

604
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:45,609
Rachel!

605
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,610
That too.

606
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,779
Are we cool?

607
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,130
We are.

608
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:58,620
Do you hear that?

609
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,330
What?

610
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:04,180
That.

611
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,000
What?

612
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,240
The peace.

613
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,000
I've been writing about
peace all these days.

614
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,160
Now, I can feel it.

615
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,880
And hear it.

616
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,290
Do you not hear it?

617
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,160
I think everyone should hear
this at least one time in life.

618
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:47,330
Tati!

619
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,340
Where are we?

620
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,360
Casa Luna.

621
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,570
No, no.

622
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:59,370
Where are you and me?

623
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,210
Jason, we are
where we need to be.

624
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:13,250
Two people who
took the same trip.

625
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:15,670
We're just relaxing.

626
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,910
Yuplon's guilt.

627
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,380
Yes, guilty number one.

628
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,490
If I had asked you
this a few days ago...

629
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,560
Would you have
answered me the same?

630
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:36,130
No, I don't think so.

631
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,570
It's hard to believe that two
people who are attracted...

632
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:45,390
Have not crossed
that line on a trip.

633
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,570
- Why do you ask me that?
- Nothing.

634
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:53,320
I'm just curious.

635
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,269
But, if we are
attracted to each other...

636
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,270
And have such a good time.

637
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,970
Why can't we cross that line?

638
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
Because I'm not ready.

639
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:14,070
What did happen with your ex?

640
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,220
I already told you I
don't want to talk about it.

641
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:20,010
Please tell me.

642
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:24,780
I think it's about
time to overcome that.

643
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:27,760
Besides.

644
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:30,010
Part of this trip was about it.

645
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:35,999
That was the main reason
I ran away from San José.

646
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Why running away?

647
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,550
You should feel happy and proud.

648
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,340
Also, it is part of the
blog you're writing.

649
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,800
To find yourself and peace.

650
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,530
You really want
to know. Don't you?

651
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,160
Alright.

652
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,700
Let me see where to start from.

653
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,700
I met Alonso two years ago.

654
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:20,240
- I was interviewing some people.
- No, no.

655
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:24,590
Tell it to me with energy. You
criticized the the story I told yesterday.

656
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I met Alonso two years ago.

657
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:40,199
I remember I was in the
park doing some interviews.

658
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:45,040
We were doing some articles about
the employment situation in Costa Rica.

659
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,189
I saw him.

660
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:50,999
It was impossible not to see
him. He was talking on the phone.

661
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,380
I remember I finished the
interview and I sat next to him.

662
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,539
I waited.

663
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:02,400
Then he looked at me. It
was a beautiful connection.

664
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:07,369
Very strange but beautiful. I
felt something I can't explain.

665
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:12,190
I tried to interview him, obviously,
it was very difficult for me.

666
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,590
I felt too many butterflies, he
noticed it. I was so nervous about it.

667
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:22,840
I was asking about his job. I
wanted to know if he was unemployed.

668
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:27,069
He ended up telling me
that he was an architect.

669
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:29,930
However, his life's dream
was always to be an actor.

670
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,060
We spoke about everything.

671
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,010
Once we finished the interview
I asked him to sign the paper.

672
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,030
He wrote down his name.

673
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:42,009
But his phone number too.

674
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,010
Old school.

675
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,620
Obviously, that's
where it all started.

676
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,999
At first, everything was super
nice. We got along really well.

677
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,439
I loved the way he talked
to me. I felt like a princess.

678
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,110
In five months, we
were inseparable.

679
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:02,590
We loved to watch
movies. It feels like I'm there.

680
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,110
We loved those absurd comedies.

681
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,540
Horror films too. Very good.

682
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,909
We loved doing everything.
We went out to eat, working out...

683
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:17,290
We talked about life, we
thought about the future.

684
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,999
Sometimes just having
coffee, being there together.

685
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,019
Then it came our first February
14th together, shopping in Miami.

686
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,670
Birthdays, the first Christmas.

687
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,049
He always helped
me with my things.

688
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:33,050
He was always very
involved with my work.

689
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:37,939
Sometimes I wanted to die, I had
no ideas, the articles did not come out.

690
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,810
But he was always were there
giving me super smart ideas.

691
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:45,330
Everything was amazing. Everything
was laughs, it was all good time.

692
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,429
We had a good time.

693
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:52,980
He was my soul mate, we even thought
about our future and how we would live.

694
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,480
Until.

695
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,359
Who the hell is she?

696
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,359
What the hell is this, Alonso?

697
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,360
Who is she?

698
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,749
- Why are you doing this?
- Please, calm down.

699
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:12,760
I don't want you
here. Get out. Get out.

700
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:26,450
In the photo...

701
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:29,450
Well, you know.

702
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,750
That was all.

703
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,880
Just like that.

704
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:39,270
What a jerk!

705
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,560
I started this journey alone...

706
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,409
- I think this is how it should end.
- But, Tati.

707
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:17,980
Wait.

708
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:27,600
We have had a great time.

709
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,650
I have been very
well, seriously.

710
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:35,180
When I was telling
you about Alonso.

711
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:39,290
I realized that obviously,
I am not over him.

712
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,829
And I'm not going to get over
it If I stay with you these days.

713
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:49,280
Because I feel
things for you, Jason.

714
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:54,330
And I start to remember how
everything ended up with Alonso.

715
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,350
I can't. I really can't.

716
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:02,530
That's not the
purpose of this trip.

717
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,590
I need some time for myself.

718
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,840
That's how I want the
rest of the trip to be.

719
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,610
That's what I did it for.

720
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,720
Look, Jason.

721
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:27,030
I don't want you to be
upset with me. Please?

722
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,960
Who knows.

723
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,990
Maybe we can go out
in a few weeks in the city.

724
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,720
Perhaps.

725
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:43,630
But I need to be
by myself for now.

726
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,910
I'm sorry.

727
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:54,010
I understand.

728
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,390
I'm happy for you.

729
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:01,830
That way, nobody gets hurt.

730
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:18,450
I want you to enjoy these
days as there's no tomorrow.

731
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:22,150
You deserve it.

732
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:24,400
Thank you.

733
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:27,760
Because this has been
the best trip after all.

734
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,030
How did you feel?

735
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,980
It was great. Thank
you very much.

736
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:54,260
- In fact, this goes into the blog.
- That's good, really good.

737
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,930
However.

738
01:32:56,610 --> 01:33:01,360
We shouldn't wait that something
happen in our lives to do things like this.

739
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,859
What you are doing...

740
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:08,030
Everyone should do it. Regardless
of what is happening in their lives.

741
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:11,209
And these exercises...

742
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:13,210
Are precisely for it.

743
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,820
When did you decide
on this lifestyle?

744
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:18,750
I think...

745
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,820
I realized I don't
depend on anyone else.

746
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:25,790
I was done.

747
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:32,010
Not only in the city
you can live a hectic life.

748
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,880
What is the secret of all this?

749
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:40,630
The secret...

750
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,750
I'll say it to you
in the fifth class.

751
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:51,810
Actually.

752
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,260
I think you know the secret.

753
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:02,389
Have you suffered for someone?

754
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:04,390
Of course, like everybody.

755
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,520
This is not about gender.

756
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:09,140
Did you know that people...

757
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:14,200
Very often do not realize the
wonderful things they have in life.

758
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:17,440
They just see what
is in front of them.

759
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:19,880
In my case...

760
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:22,170
I met God.

761
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:26,550
And these wonderful exercises
that gives me inner peace.

762
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,330
I hope not to stop doing this.

763
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,140
I have met so many people.

764
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,959
But they don't know.

765
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,960
Or maybe they
don’t understand this.

766
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:41,500
They think this is
all a waste of time.

767
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,480
The worst thing about this...

768
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:51,000
They carry so many negative
things that they don't even realize.

769
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:53,580
So much hate.

770
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,920
So much...

771
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,060
- Disappointment.
- Fears.

772
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,440
Correct.

773
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,880
You know what?

774
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:07,579
I have some friends in San José who I
think could help you with this process.

775
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,150
Yes!

776
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:12,450
Good news, of course.
That's awesome.

777
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:16,500
Could I ask you some
questions to use in my blog?

778
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:18,770
Yes, go ahead.

779
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:28,150
What are three elements that you
consider are needed to find inner peace?

780
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,049
Let me see.

781
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:35,220
There are many elements, including
all the exercises that you already know.

782
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:38,940
But I would believe
that, at least for me.

783
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:43,340
The most important one.

784
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:47,930
It's forgiveness

785
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:51,000
Tatiana.

786
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:53,470
We want inner peace. Right?

787
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,670
But we can't forgive ourselves.

788
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,630
In fact.

789
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:04,270
We keep reminiscing over and over again
the images of all the people who hurt us.

790
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:08,709
We can read all
the self-help books.

791
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:10,710
We can do all the
classes we want.

792
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:13,190
We could visit all
the psychologists.

793
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,300
We can pray all day.

794
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:18,490
All that helps.

795
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:24,270
But you have to forgive
yourself from your heart.

796
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:29,240
You have to forgive all the
people who have hurt you.

797
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:31,590
Also, from your heart.

798
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:35,460
That's the only way to
find inner peace in your life.

799
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,580
It's the only way.

800
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:44,350
Any other questions?

801
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:49,790
That's all.

802
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,870
Thank you so much, Elena.

803
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:54,440
Good.

804
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:20,510
Excuse me.

805
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,120
Tatiana?

806
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:24,409
Yes?

807
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:25,620
Tatiana Valle?

808
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,250
- Yes.
- What an honor!

809
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:28,539
Thank you.

810
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:30,319
I've been reading your blog.

811
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,320
- It's really good. Great work.
- Thanks.

812
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:33,970
How do you recognize me?

813
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:37,630
You know the photo of the
team on the website, you're there.

814
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:39,670
Yeah, that's true. Good memory.

815
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,910
- In fact, I am writing the last part.
- It's definitely great!

816
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:46,140
Thank you!

817
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:49,510
- What did you like the most?
- Actually, everything.

818
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:52,169
But especially yesterday.

819
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:57,500
It’s very personal. You write a lot about
your experiences and I identify myself.

820
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,560
That's quite a topic because...

821
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,600
I don't usually write like
that. That's not my style.

822
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:04,710
It has been a bit difficult.

823
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,360
But yesterday's one was so good.

824
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:11,840
You talked about forgiveness and how you
forgave a person who had treated you badly.

825
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:13,500
I am from this town.

826
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,920
My family has a
life-long business.

827
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:19,639
My parents have always
told me since I remember...

828
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:22,250
That I have to manage
the business here.

829
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:23,879
But.

830
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,880
Two years ago.

831
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,260
I fell in love with photography.

832
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:30,450
So they decided
not to support me.

833
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:33,510
I hated my mom.

834
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:36,820
We couldn't even see each
other. We fought too much.

835
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:39,150
Whenever we talked,
we ended up arguing.

836
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:40,990
One day.

837
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,080
She came asking
me for forgiveness.

838
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,120
But I didn't want
to forgive her.

839
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,920
Until yesterday
when I read your blog.

840
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:53,460
You wrote about forgiveness.

841
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,520
You forgave that person.

842
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,800
And it brought you
so much happiness.

843
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:01,770
So I came early.

844
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,640
I'm going to have
dinner with her.

845
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,050
I'm going to talk to her.

846
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:12,059
If you had not written about forgiveness
and how you forgave that person.

847
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:16,090
I would not have the courage
to do what I going to do tonight.

848
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,600
Are you alright?

849
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,419
Yes.

850
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,420
All good.

851
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:31,949
Actually. Thank you!

852
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:33,519
For telling me this.

853
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,150
I have to go.

854
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,520
I'll wait for the last
part of the blog.

855
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,520
Alonso?

856
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:04,270
Yes, it's me.

857
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,079
I just want...

858
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,080
I'm just calling to
tell you something.

859
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:18,700
These days...

860
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,400
I have been to different places.

861
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:25,290
I learned a lot.

862
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:31,230
There was one in particular.

863
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:43,660
I cannot hate someone
for my entire life.

864
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:47,560
No matter how
much you've hurt me.

865
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:55,780
You know everything
we had ahead of us.

866
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,520
You were the love of my life.

867
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,640
You made a huge mistake.

868
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:11,180
That's something
I cannot change.

869
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:16,310
I can't go back to you.
You know that won't happen.

870
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,640
But I want you to know.

871
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,300
Despite everything,
you put me through.

872
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,480
I forgive you.

873
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,779
Well, just that.

874
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:56,780
Nothing more, and...

875
01:42:58,370 --> 01:43:03,190
I really do not wish
for you or her any harm.

876
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:10,850
I hope everything
goes well in your life.

877
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:22,469
Alright.

878
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:26,060
All that's good.

879
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,920
Thank you.

880
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:36,380
And thank you for
everything we lived.

881
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:41,560
Bye!

882
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,900
What is the real
meaning of inner peace?

883
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:15,750
Is it perhaps being
successful in our projects?

884
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,760
Or is it perhaps
overcoming a stage of pain?

885
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:24,110
Or it may be to understand that
every second of life is a privilege.

886
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:29,460
A good man told me that
you have inner peace or not.

887
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,590
Simple as it.

888
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:33,790
It is not something
you get on a journey.

889
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:35,990
It is not something you
only get by forgiving.

890
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:39,170
It is not something that
grows as you do new things.

891
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:43,630
It is a lifestyle for
each one of us.

892
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:48,329
One in which despite
difficult or cloudy times.

893
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:52,200
Our mind, soul, and
heart remain steadfast.

894
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,120
I started a journey to
forget about the world.

895
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:58,930
But it reminded me that I
live surrounded by people.

896
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:02,620
People I can learn from
them if I only listen carefully.

897
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:07,630
Places where I can fill myself with energy
if I just enjoy them without a cell phone.

898
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:12,440
This trip reminded me that
happiness is in ourselves.

899
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:18,520
It's impossible to let ourselves be loved or to
love others, if we do not love ourselves first.

900
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:21,299
It's such a hackneyed phrase.

901
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:23,300
But I finally get it.

902
01:45:23,670 --> 01:45:26,449
If you are reading this blog, ask yourself.

903
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:28,449
Do I have peace?

904
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:31,830
If you cannot answer,
I recommend you to discover it.

905
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,899
Because in my case...

906
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:37,130
The peace I was looking for
was only One Step From Me.

907
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:08,840
Mr. Juan Carlos. How are you?

908
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:11,340
I'm doing good.

909
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,080
Really?

910
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,700
So many views?

911
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,080
What a relief!

912
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,710
This is so good.

913
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:28,570
Thank you so much.

914
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:38,760
Yes, for sure. Tomorrow Saturday?

915
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:42,789
If it can be better on Monday.

916
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:44,790
There is something I want to do before.

917
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:50,090
Alright!

918
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:52,929
Sir?

919
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:54,280
Excuse me!

920
01:46:55,090 --> 01:46:57,090
I just...

921
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:59,100
Thank you.

922
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:01,170
Thank you so much for...

923
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:06,000
Giving me the opportunity
to write the blog.

924
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:09,930
It changed my life.

925
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:12,050
So, thank you so much for it.

926
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,760
I'll see you on Monday.

927
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,670
Alright!
