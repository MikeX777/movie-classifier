with anybody with missing limbs
or anything?

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,754
Not that I can remember, Juanita.

10

That's what the other kids
used to call me.

my ass today, 'cause I've worked
really hard on my ass, you know?

49
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,516
[ Sighs ]
Anyway.

50
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:25,646
One year--

51
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,451
I think I was in the fifth grade--

52
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:30,651
my mama took me shopping
for school clothes...

53
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:33,320
and I had gotten fatter.

54
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:36,523
I had to try on jeans.

55
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,897
Well, the only ones that would fit
were the husky ones, you know?

56
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:44,405
They had that label on the back
that said ""Husky.''

57
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:48,273
It was kind of announced
to everyone behind me I was a husky.

58
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:53,470
I started crying.

59
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,382
I didn't want everybody
to know I was a husky.

60
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:00,378
And my mama...

61
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:04,255
sat me down right there in Sears
and told me no one else had to know.

62
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,385
Just me and her.

63
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,623
It was our little secret.

64
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:12,997
So, she bought the Husky jeans.
She took 'em home.

65
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:17,562
And then she went to the Goodwill,
and she bought some used jeans.

66
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,941
Well, she took the label
off the Husky jeans
and sewed on the ""Slim'' label...

67
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:25,946
from the Goodwill ones.

68
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,881
Slim. Shit.

69
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:34,655
Like I could pull that off.

70
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:40,092
It's just the kind of mama
she was though.

71
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:45,929
Never made me feel bad
about being fat. She--

72
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:50,938
She always just made it okay.

73
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:56,535
And I've always thought that
that is unconditional love, and--

74
00:04:56,612 --> 00:05:00,343
Well, maybe if I told her
I was gay, it'd--

75
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:02,975
you know, it'd apply.

76
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:07,250
And this other thought
just keeps running through my head:

77
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,916
She'd just try and change the labels...

78
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:12,017
from gay to straight.

79
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:19,262
I tried to do that for years.

80
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:22,735
I love your new song. You gonna
sing it at the dance on Saturday?

81
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:25,295
That's the plan.

82
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:28,366
- See you boys in the funny papers.
- All right.

83
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:31,412
I just can't get Peggy
off of my mind, Wardell.

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,382
- That's some serious-ass shit
you've been through, G.W.
- I'm in agony.

85
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,681
- Yeah, I can tell.
- I remember it so vividly.

86
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:42,622
We met at the Bonanza over in Abilene,
had us a nice steak supper.

87
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:44,682
She followed me back to the motel.

88
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,456
Jacob's ladder.

89
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:51,124
Witch's hat.

90
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,657
You do Jacob's ladder, then witch's hat.
Two tricks in one.

91
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:59,264
Well, one trick,
and then you do another by just
pulling the string with your teeth.

92
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,933
You have too much time
on your hands, Odell.

93
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:06,469
- Ain't that somethin'?
- You know what I can't
get off of my mind?

94
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:08,846
- Oh, here we go again.
- I can't get that...

95
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,283
- pig-bloating incident off my mind.
- What?

96
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:14,254
Please, G. W., if I have to hear
that goddamn pig story again...

97
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:17,485
- I think I'll just shit.
- All happened at the Tyler County Fair.

98
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:20,084
I guess now's a good a time as any.

99
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:24,758
Was that steak tender,
the one you ate that night Peggy died?

100
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,530
Thank you, hon!
I'll see you at the funeral!

101
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:30,537
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

102
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:35,304
I sure as hell wouldn't have
quit smoking if I had known
my sister was going to die.

103
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:39,006
Three days now.
I am about to die myself.

104
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,072
H-H-Hold on.

105
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:44,277
Ouch. Oh, Lord.

106
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,877
Huh? Oh, nothing.

107
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:50,447
Well, if you must know,
it's a little quit-smoking therapy...

108
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:55,895
that Roger over at the Beehive
shared with me while he was
back-combing my hair.

109
00:06:55,964 --> 00:07:00,162
He paid $2,000 at this clinic
over in Snyder...

110
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:03,602
and they give him a rubber band--

111
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:08,507
told him to pop his arm with it
every time he wanted a cigarette.

112
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:10,511
It's called, uh...

113
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,605
behavior modifi-something another.

114
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:16,207
Roger can tell ya the exact wordage.

115
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:18,479
Anyway, it ain't workin'.

116
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:22,319
See, I go down to Tyler every year
for the county fair. Broom.

117
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,156
Oh, I just love all them animals
and them displays of macramÃ©...

118
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,287
and the cooking competition and all.

119
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,389
Besides, it gives me a chance
to see me and Wardell's sister.

120
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:35,527
I once made a rooster out of beans
and lentils when I was a girl...

121
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,595
in vacation Bible school.

122
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:39,640
- It's almost lifelike.
- Uh-huh.

123
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,733
- How is old Mozelle?
- Oh, she's fine.

124
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,904
Me and Mozelle, we had us
some good times once upon a time.

125
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,881
You know, her and Darrel
have had a bunch of marital problems.

126
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,509
He beat her up a few times.
Tepee.

127
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:53,179
Mama hung old Cockadoodle
in the kitchen.

128
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,246
That's what I called him.
""Cockadoodle.''

129
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:59,987
- That's amazing.
- But, uh, boll weevils
started eating them beans.

130
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,052
- And that was all she wrote.
- That's amazing.

131
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,965
- You know, any man who hits
a woman is no man at all.
- You got that right.

132
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:10,368
- Darrel's in group therapy
for abusive husbands now.
- Oh.

133
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:15,603
A bunch of wife-beaters
gets together once a week with
this specialist, and they purge.

134
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:17,804
Some of them
are deadbeat dads too.

135
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,508
Used to be two groups.
One for wife-beaters
and one for deadbeat dads.

136
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,679
But so many of them crossed over
from one group to the next,
they just merged.

137
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:29,281
Hey. They merged and they purged.
[ Chuckles ]

138
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:32,417
I've seen boll weevils in flour...

in, uh, oatmeal and parik-- paprika...

140
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:39,895
but never on a rooster
you made in vacation Bible school.

141
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:42,493
I probably should have married Mozelle
instead of Noleta...

142
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:45,005
and then I wouldn't have been
compelled to fool around...

143
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:47,371
and Peggy would still be alive.

144
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:51,242
Well, it's just somewhat awkward
when your neighbor's husband
kills your sister.

coming out here to see me.

conversations, and we need to
talk about your mama, but not...

00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:10,760
Brother Boy thought he was
Tammy Wynette the last time I seen him.

659
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:14,398
- About a year ago.
- Before that it was Loretta.

just sing the shit out of that song.

- Mostly.

and that big, ol' white gown...

Brother Boy was her spittin' image.

You know, Sissy Spacek could not
hold a candle to Brother Boy's Loretta.

No. She could not.

to those records, you almost forgot.

Then Tammy came along.

I had found my soul mate.

I followed her rise
all the way to the top.

681

She had such a rough life.

Oh. Illness after illness
and financial woes.

in our sessions, and I truly believe...

Now that she's gone.

that Brother Boy was in
the Christmas pageant?

Oh, Lord, yes. He couldn't have
been more than five or six.

And he talked Wanda Jean Hilltop
into switching parts with him.

And Wanda Jean showed up
as a shepherd, and Brother Boy

- Me and Sissy.

- 'Cause he's my baby brother, Latrelle.

Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not quite sure what the point is.

The point is for you
to start fantasizing about a woman.

A real woman. A woman who is
feminine and sexy and all woman.

at the funeral. He'll be a spectacle.

The only thing wrong with him,

is that he likes to
