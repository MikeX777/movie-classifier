About ten years ago,
we were doing some parties.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,354
And then we came up
with the idea

55

<i>of doing a night
called Gay Bingo.</i>

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,191
How many ways can you call out

57
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,789

She was selling 74 fairy cakes.

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,195
I went, "I want some of them."

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,879
She was selling them

<i>It's a magnet, almost,

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,512
It wasn't so much
about playing bingo, though.

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,474
It was more about being
as outrageous as possible.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,512
Pushing things
as far as we possibly could.

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,109
Oh, look, everybody, Ma
Butcher's coming up on a pill.

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,355
What made Gay Bingo special
was anarchy.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,120
She's coming up,
she's coming up!

69
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,640

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,877

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,116
and we're gonna fuck you up.

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,914
<i>We were outrageous.
It was provocative.</i>

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,713
It wasn't about being cool.

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,915
It was about being
completely and utterly insane.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,752
<i>I think Gay Bingo was messy.</i>

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,678
It was about
getting off your nut.

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,512
It was anarchic in a way. Kind
of bingo turned on its head.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,791
<i>A springboard
for doing other stuff.</i>

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,798

<i>You don't

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000

69!

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,432
What it was all about
at the end of the day

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,233
was the number 69.

85
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,431
Who wants to do the 69? Come on.

86
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,792
Oh my God, you're gonna have
to get all those clothes off.

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,113
If the number 69 pops up
on the number cruncher,

88
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,677
- Jonny starts dry humping.
- Yeah, dry humping.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,836
Dry humping someone.

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,477
OK, do you wanna
see a slot machine? It's time!

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,037
You sit on their face and stick

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,949
Much to the excitement

93
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,753
69!

94
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,590
It celebrated the east, and it
celebrated the alternative.

95
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,191
And the fashion and the art
and the weird and the music

96
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,872
and this collaboration
just ignited something.

97
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,240
OK, we are now
going for a full house.

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,955
In the early days of Gay Bingo,
we were either

99
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,072
on a massive comedown of drugs
from the weekend

100
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,637
<i>and to counteract your,

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,073
<i>the kind of massive insecurities
you get on a comedown off drugs,</i>

102
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,477
<i>obviously there'd be a lot

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,991
<i>And so that became
a fixed thing with everyone.</i>

104
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,271
<i>We're on, we're pissed
and the audience are pissed</i>

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,198
<i>and for a long time it worked.</i>

106
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,040
<i>But there got to a point
where it stopped working.</i>

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,200
<i>My drinking is linked in
to being in social situations</i>

108
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,518
<i>and partying and also if I have
one drink I have the lot.</i>

109
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,439
I don't know when to stop.
I don't stop.

110
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,395
You know, there is no stop.
There has never been a stop.

111
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,752
Beep, beep went the nurse
to the doctor one day

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,839
There's a drag queen in
emergency and I just wanna say

113
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,476
Her wig's on backward,
she thinks she's a catch

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,672
Her liver's in her handbag
and her kidneys don't match

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,872
Beep, beep went the doctor
when he found the nurse

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,674
The drag queen in emergency
is getting worse

117
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,520
She shallow fried her liver
and swallowed it whole

118
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,838
And the blood in her veins
is alcohol

119
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,034
Coo-ee!

120
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,157

- I'm fine.

122
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,112
My mum told me once, and this
was quite recently actually,

123
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,917
she said, "I was always worried
that you were always kind of..."

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,316
Not so much scared of failure,
really,

125
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,794
but I think she was worried

126
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,833
that if I felt I hadn't done
well enough, I'd commit suicide.

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,953
Listen, he looks his best
anyway cos he's my son.

128
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,833

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,872

I hope you've only had three.
I don't want any more.

136
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,990

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,074
Nothing
was gonna stand in my way.

171
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,958
<i>I started kind of pulling
various people together</i>

172
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,040
<i>and got really excited
about seeing something new</i>

173
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,710
<i>and really community blossoming.</i>

174
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,150
<i>There was also this, you know,</i>

175
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,194
<i>thrill at kind of working
with loads of different people.</i>

176
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,794
- Morning, Woo-Woos.
- Hi, trans.

177
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,516
It's Amber Swallows, look.
She's trans.

178
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,791
Welcome!

179
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,152
<i>I consider myself
to be a straight woman</i>

180
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,717
but I've also been a gay man.

181
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,479
Morning!

182
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,195
<i>When I first
met Amber as she is now,</i>

183
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,470
<i>she was Dean.</i>

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,035
Every time I see her
she's had some more work done.

185
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,073
This is it, we're getting on.
Document it.

186
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,840
<i>I used to have a skinhead,
have tattoos all up my neck,</i>

187
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,032
which I am just kind of
like getting rid of.

188
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,071
<i>My whole dressing-up side has
gradually kind of taken over.</i>

189
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,831
<i>We are the trannies
doing a gay tent at Glastonbury,</i>

190
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,474
<i>which has
never been done before.</i>

191
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
Have you seen the hotel sign?
Have you seen all this shit?

192
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,193
<i>We have our role to play.</i>

193
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,035
<i>It's a zone,
it's the trans zone.</i>

194
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,753
<i>It's about being colourful.</i>

195
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,031
So what if our balls
are hanging out of our bikinis?

196
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,470
<i>I love working
with loads of other people.</i>

197
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,231
<i>I love seeing people get excited
about being part of the scene.</i>

198
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,674
<i>I love new faces coming on
and trying out mad looks</i>

199
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,235
<i>for the first time and being
part of the dance troupes.</i>

200
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,512
<i>♪ Move a little closer,
you can see it in my eyes</i>

201
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,836
There aren't any more.
We need them.

202
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,715
<i>♪ To hell and back and that's
something I can't disguise</i>

203
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,473
<i>♪ How does it make you feel</i>

204
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,479
<i>It's camaraderie.
It's part of it all.</i>

205
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,831
This is the fucking work
getting done.

206
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,236
Jonny will probably
be naked in a field.

207
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,478
And Amber Swallows
will be fabulous. Where is she?

208
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,195
Hey, hey!
Welcome to Glastonburg!

209
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,633
I've come
as a representation of Aids.

210
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,592
People died,
this is a symbol of death.

211
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,234
It's very glamorous.

212
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,272
In drag!

213
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,199
<i>It might not look glamorous
but inside,</i>

214
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,754
we're feeling glamorous.

215
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,431
It's pissing with rain
out there.

216
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,313
Not happy!

217
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,400
- This is nice.
- Just something I picked up.

218
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,193
In a brothel!

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,515
Make some noise!

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,071
Lousy fucking bitches!

221
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,432
<i>It's always very mixed.</i>

222
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,313
Yeah, I'll be getting my kit off

223
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,079
<i>and if they don't like it,
fuck 'em.</i>

224
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,590
Who cares? They're all
off their tits on acid anyway.

225
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,633
Are you ready for a show?

226
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,159
<i>This is a crew
who were so on fire.</i>

227
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,509
It was a crest of a wave.

228
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,313
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!

229
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,229
My name is Scottee
and we are here to entertain!

230
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,832
<i>It was that feeling
of, oh my God,</i>

231
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,633
<i>I belong somewhere.</i>

232
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,080
Got this sense
of like community.

233
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,317
<i>It was completely
and utterly bonkers.</i>

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,432
<i>Everyone was
completely off their tits.</i>

235
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,912
Stand clear.
We're coming through.

236
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,077
Holestar!

237
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,192
My God, tranny injury.

238
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,754
Holestar has been hurt.

239
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,111
She's not dead, that's all
we have at the moment.

240
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,515
I slipped over.

241
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,712
All I know is my knee went
one way, I went the other way.

242
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,513
It fucking kills.

243
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,869
This is absolutely live.

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,993
Holestar being carted off
to the Priory.

245
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,954
Holestar, we've heard
you were pushed. Is this true?

246
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,558
That's nasty!

247
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,957
She pushed you. She pushed you.

248
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,072
All the drag queens
thought it was hilarious.

249
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,395
She's off to Hollywood

250
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,080
to have her fanny stitched up
or something.

251
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,634
In memory of Holestar,
we are renaming tonight's number

252
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,117
not <i>Rapture</i> but <i>Fracture.</i>

253
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,393
Yeah!

254
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,637
<i>♪ Whoa-oh-oh</i>

255
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,240
<i>After, what is it now, 15 weeks,</i>

256
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,272
<i>I've finally got
the results back.</i>

257
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,869
<i>Something's degenerated
below my kneecap.</i>

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,959
I'll have JPS, actually.
Menthols, please.

259
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
Yeah, thank you.

260
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,115
<i>It's quite upsetting,
especially when people think</i>

261
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,469
<i>you're doing it for sympathy.</i>

262
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,956
I've not actually received
any sympathy

263
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,470
so I wouldn't
be doing it for those reasons.

264
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,159
Julie. Julie Holestar.

265
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,954
<i>Apparently she twisted her toe
or something. I can't think.</i>

266
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,595
<i>People just
didn't seem to give a shit.</i>

267
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,032
<i>I feel like I don't exist.</i>

268
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,311
Because you're an animal
that's been injured

269
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,035
<i>and packs of animals,
when one is wounded,</i>

270
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,913
<i>when one is lame, they leave it.</i>

271
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,192
And when I was first diagnosed
with hypermobility syndrome,

272
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,073
erm, I was 20.

273
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,760
<i>The doctor
that diagnosed me initially,</i>

274
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,997
<i>said that I would probably
be in a wheelchair</i>

275
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,713
<i>by the time I was 30.</i>

276
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,117
This accident pre-empted
what life could be like.

277
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,597
But I eventually will have to be
in a wheelchair permanently.

278
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,473
Which is really upsetting.

279
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,069
- I assume she's quite well.
- Fair to middling.

280
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,395
Yeah.

281
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,955
After Glastonbury,

282
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,914
<i>Time Out</i> asked me to throw a
party at the Royal Opera House

283
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,671
to show off the best of
east London's drag superstars.

284
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,551
It was a showcase for Jonny

285
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,912
to do something with a
bigger budget in a bigger space.

286
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,111
<i>I don't want to jinx it,
I am kind of like</i>

287
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,356
the drag queen of choice.

288
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,597
<i>Hopefully I'm making
hay while the sun shines.</i>

289
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,037
I don't know if it's brave
of them getting Jonny,

290
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,720
but it's definitely something
quite edgy that they're doing.

291
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,719
Stop. Stop.

292
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,559
I don't feel too nervous,
actually.

293
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,717
<i>I will be a bit later.</i>

294
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,274
<i>Jonny's talented,</i>

295
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,959
<i>he's got
the vision, the direction.</i>

296
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,834
I see my sort of job working
with him as a kind of enabler.

297
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,317
Be ready. This show is gonna
start, ready or not.

298
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,717
<i>I've only given myself a job so
I can hang around and be part of</i>

299

307
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,071
Jonny Woo's a superstar now.
He's busting it out.

308
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,115
You got some lipstick for Jonny?
Quickly.

309
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,436
Everyone, calm down.
I've got lipstick for Jonny.

310
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,236
Jonny needs lipstick.
Jonny, I've got some somewhere.

311
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,477

There's not many of them.

315
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,231
You standing there
in your girly poofy outfits.

316
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,910
I'm more of a man
than you could ever be.

317
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,793
More of a woman
you could ever want.

318
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,310
Bend over,
spread 'em and start praying.

319
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,352
<i>All of those things
that Jonny's really good at,</i>

320
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,790
I thought he was bigger
than he ever has been.

321
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,116
Although I've spent all week
having weird dreams,

322
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,435
being really anxious.

323
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,029

<i>I wanted to get as many

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,314
<i>Holestar was out

<i>It was fab to see her

334
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,354
This is the best thing ever.
And I really mean it.

335
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Like, I'm sweating.

336
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,992

<i>there was a sense
of togetherness.</i>

339
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,440
It's sad that we don't have
that togetherness any more.

341

last year.

342
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,389

She's damaged.

344
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,233
It's about my dad.

345
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,113
He's also quite damaged.

346
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,674
It's about me.

347
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,069
My mum was an alcoholic

<i>that I wanted to be a woman,

372
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,430
You start to see everybody

And you're fucking terrified.

374
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,870
There are people as young

376
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,955

381
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,034
My mum and dad
did the best they could.

382
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,633
First time that I really knew

383
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,720
I was a transsexual man
was when I was 13.

384
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,993
My favourite T-Girl,
Miss Amber Swallows!

385

<i>Amber's on the road

386
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,072
Yeah, it's a big step to take.

387
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,272
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is evening wear.

388
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,198
Putting the wig back in the box

389
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,710
and keeping the wig on
all the time

390
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,914
are two different things.

391
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,554
<i>You do get a lot of girls</i>

392
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,195
<i>that you get your first bit
of surgery or whatever,</i>

393
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,720
<i>or you get a nice pair of tits</i>

394
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,072
<i>and it turns into
more of an addiction.</i>

395
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,032
You end up looking like
a cartoon character

396
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,310

397
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,954
She's absolutely wonderful.

398
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,073
Wearing all of last year's
fashions at the same time!

399
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,076
<i>I'm having a big
major operation tomorrow.</i>

400
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,635
<i>A little treat for myself.</i>

401
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,118
Tomorrow, that is what
I'm having done tomorrow.

402
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,236
So... So, Amber,
you look a little bit different.

403
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,478
Pretty much, yes,
I've just come out of hospital.

404
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,115
Apparently
I was a real heavy bleeder.

405
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,357
So I'm kind of used to that

406
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,233
with all the tampons
I go through anyway!

407
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,594
So next ingredients
into the fucking fruitcake

408
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,599
are a pair of tits!

409
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,555
<i>Everybody keeps asking me
about downstairs.</i>

410
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,796
Keep the peace.

411
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,799
You know what they say?
Keep the peace, babe.

412
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,393
That's what I am in life. A
three-legged girl with a secret.

413
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,796
<i>I used to be really good friends
with my dad at one point</i>

414
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,515
<i>but I think I've messed
the relationship up</i>

415
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,712
<i>because of a situation
that happened a few years ago.</i>

416
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,679
<i>My phone had gone missing.</i>

417
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,598
<i>And then I realised, oh my God,</i>

418
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,916
<i>it's my naughty phone
that went missing.</i>

419
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,035
It's literally got pictures
of the insides of my fanny

420
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,232
<i>so that kind of gives you
an idea of what's in the phone!</i>

421
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,277
<i>So my dad has gone
through the phone,</i>

422
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,551
obviously seen
all these text messages.

423
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,399
<i>"Amber, when am I gonna get to</i>

425
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,831
I opened the front door
to my daddy.

426
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,715
And he threw the phone
at my head and spat in my face!

427
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,560
He was like, "You're a fucking
disgrace, you, Amber."

428
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,279
<i>There's a big difference

446
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,990
Cos I guess
they're expecting a man.

447
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,554
I presume.

448
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,038

<i>Calling myself

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,198
I've got a feeling
they might be outside.

452
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,752
- Hello.
- Hi.

453
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,679
I'm not ignoring you.
I'll be back in a moment.

454
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,354
Anyone for drag? No drag?

455
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,794
Anyone for drag? Drag?

456
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,037
Anyone here for drag?

457
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,595
Anyone for drag?

458
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,440
No? Let's just go back in
and sod it.

459
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,236
Why do you think people
might not want to do it?

460
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,352
Because they're scared.

461
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,435
Can't teach it with two people.

462
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,155
A grumpy young boy
and a lesbian.

463
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,472
Ooh, the drama!

464
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,115
Ooh, pull, push.

00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,240
- Holestar is amazing.
- Private Hole!

467
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,000
There's no one else coming.
Sod them.

468
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,000
She's a rose between 15
transvestite thorns, isn't she?

469
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,557
She's even more funny
when she doesn't mean to be.

470
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,912
Come forward, come forward,
come closer, come closer.

471
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,632
So...
If you haven't noticed already,

472
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,638
I'm not actually a man.

473
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,353
I'm actually a lady.

474
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,915
And I call myself
the tranny with a fanny.

475
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,957
And that's my kind of shtick,
really.

476
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,117
You may be thinking
why is a woman doing drag

477
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,675
or what qualifications
does a woman have to do drag?

478
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,271
Well, I've been doing this now
for seven years.

479
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,198
Used to do it in Europe.

480
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,959
In Vienna,
all round central Europe.

481
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,037
She's got a lot to say
about gender

482
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,959
and what you're allowed to do
cos she was in the army.

483
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,278
<i>She went through
the whole trying to be normal.</i>

484
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,710
<i>And then realised what the fuck
was I doing in the army?</i>

485
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
<i>She left the army</i>

486
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,277
and ran away
to become a drag superstar.

487
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,440
Erm... Yeah. Just looking
at those pictures.

488
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,711
My song was out yesterday.
Got a new song out.

489
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,150
Which we'll talk about later.

490
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,156
So that's me.
Tell me a bit more about you.

491
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,397
I've recently
become a Christian.

492
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,991
Erm... That's quite a big part
of my life.

493
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,873
You're gonna be Teresa Green
just for now.

494
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,435
There we go! We're getting it,
we're working it.

495
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,157

Work, work, work. Ooh!

496
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,957

498
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,154
And they're gonna be
doing my song!

499
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,794
Teresa Green, who is Jules,
was all up for doing today.

500
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,072
And mincing around in his heels.
Her heels.

501
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,830
And can't seem to find her,
she's missing in action.

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,438
from either being God
or the Holy Spirit

506
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,631
saying I shouldn't do it,

507
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,151
that it just told me
not to do it.

508
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,000
<i>♪ Yeah-hey, yeah-hey</i>

509
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,589
<i>♪ Yeah-hey, ah ah</i>

510
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,273
That was... You saw the show.
Was it good?

511
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,436
Yeah.

512
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,711
- Do you wish you'd done it?
- In a way.

513
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,354
Well, I saw him in the tent

514
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,995
and I thought he's just
got scared, what have you.

515
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,271
But he just pointed
to the ceiling and he said,

516
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,278
"I was told not to do it."

517
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,631
And it took me a minute.
Ah, God.

518
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,992
Makes me sad that we live
in a world in the 21st century

519
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,680
where people
still persecute people.

520
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,520
Putting a dress on
in a western little village

521
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,279
at a performing arts school,

522
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,995
you'd think that's normal,
par for the course.

523
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,112
But it's still something
that people

524
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,960
still find quite shocking
and wrong.

525
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,799
And that disturbs me
a little bit.

526
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,879
<i>All I'm trying to do in life</i>

527
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,195
<i>is just make a go of things.</i>

528
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,232
<i>Open a really nice shop,</i>

529
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,317
do my thing.
It's not rocket science.

530
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,832
The whole idea of the shop,
really, is to kind of like,

531
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,599
you know,
to cut out the middle man

532
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,838
in terms of buying high-end
luxury stuff.

533
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,872
So the stuff that we get here,

534
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,640
we get all the cream stuff
from the catwalk.

535
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,831
So much hot trade goes past
this shop every day.

536
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,395
Builders, scaffolders,
all day long.

537
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,592
Amber in the window! Hi!

538
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,599
My main problem is as soon
as I open my gob, you know,

539
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,154
people are on it straightaway.

540
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,840
They're like,
she's got a bit of a secret

541
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,314
she ain't telling us.

542
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,477
But I look pretty good
from behind.

543
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,400
I reckon I could pass
looking this way like that.

544
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,512
Soon as I turn around,
I'm fucked.

545
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,560
I'd only get straight gays,
only. I mean, come on.

546
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,637
Who wouldn't have a slice
of the honey pot?

547
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,673
I think it's the intrigue
and the mystery.

548
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,440
It kind of makes people
want to discover a bit more.

549
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,519
What else can she have down her
knickers apart from a big cock?

550
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,552
Maybe she's got three tits
as well, you know.

551
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,911
I went shopping this morning
at the surgery.

552
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,239
And I picked myself
a nice pair of...

553
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,036
34G silicone breasts.

554
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,834
Tried them on, had a little
whiz around the surgery.

555
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,996
They looked great.

556
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,032
They're really, really big,
though.

557
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,516
So I don't know
what they're gonna look like.

558
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,869
Do you like big tits, Tony?

559
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,356
I like any tits, to tell the
truth, as long as they're nice.

560
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,996
I'll bring them in a plastic bag
and show you!

561
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,557
It's almost like what I'm doing
here. I'm decorating the shop.

562
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,717
It's pretty much what it is.

563
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,035
To be honest, I don't know

564
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,755
where I'm gonna get the money
from to pay for my boobies.

565
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,076
I don't know where she gets
her money from.

566
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,431
She might sue me.
That's probably what she does.

567
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,233
She waits for someone
to hypothesise

568
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,760
<i>about where
she gets her money from</i>

569
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,360
<i>and then she sues them
for slander.</i>

570
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,790
That's where she gets
her money from.

571
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,913
I need to get six grand
by April. £6,000.

572
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,271
I'm gonna have to get that.

573
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,154
Cos I know who it is.
Oh, it's nonstop.

574
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,273
So where are you?

575
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,877
Highbury?

576
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,230
So you wanna come over
and see me?

577
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,357
OK, so tell me about your dick,
how big is it?

578
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,792
Really?
What do you wanna do with it?

579
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,794
What? OK, call me when you're at
the station, alright?

580
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,071
Alright, babes, bye.

581
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,399
I can't believe the time.

582
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,398
It's nine o'clock.

583
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,477
Right, I'm out of here.

584
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,117
I have to say,
I've done my research

585
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,712
and I think this is the world's
first ever boobathon.

586
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,196
Definitely tranny boobathon
anyway.

587
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,593
We're trying to get our sister
some titties.

588
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,440
<i>OK, yeah, you know,
everyone's out for themselves,</i>

589
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,234
<i>but I actually consider myself
part of like a little</i>

590
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,795
<i>tranny meerkat clan.</i>

591
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,317
It's a matter of no tits
or tits. We need tits.

592
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,999
We are raising money
for Amber's new tits.

593
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,557
We wanna see all of you
there now. Over to Ma Butcher.

594
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,755
Hard cock.

595
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,712
Boobathon!

596
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,479
Yes! It's a boobathon!

597
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,430
We love Amber!

598
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,473
It's very important cos she's
a very good friend of ours.

599
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,159
And we know
it'll make her very happy.

600
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,114
Because she doesn't get enough
action as it is.

601
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,357
The girl needs a rack!

602
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,711
We're gonna raise that dollar
one way or another.

603
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,910
She'll have those titties

604
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,637
and we as a family have bought
our sister Amber her tits.

605
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,592
And thank God for that.

606
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,671
<i>I had my sex change
six months ago.</i>

607
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,157
<i>My hair transplant was 2,500.</i>

608
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,600
My nose was 2,000.

609
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,280
This was 5,000.

610
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,395
Er... My boobs were 3,000.
My hips were 4,000.

611
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,477
And my vagina I did on the NHS.

612
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,558
<i>I just went bankrupt.</i>

613
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,990
At night I was escorting

614
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,794
to pay off
the loans for my surgery,

615
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,877
<i>which most of us have to do.</i>

616
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,074
<i>And anyone who thinks
that this is a choice</i>

617
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,112
is absolutely insane.

618
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,357
<i>Now it is eight o'clock
in the evening.</i>

619
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,632
The place is hammered.

620
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,912
<i>I'm talking about...</i>

621
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,118
How much was that worth?

622
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,074
This is a bum print, remember.

623
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,960
Ooh ooh ooh! Ooh ooh ooh!

624
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,118
<i>♪ London's getting dirty

625

<i>♪ London's getting dirty

626
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,798
Amber's tits?
No, I haven't seen 'em.

627
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,675
But I will see them.
Everyone will see them.

628
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,918
There's no rush.

629
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,319
Here he comes.

630
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,710

633
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,679
And I look around the room
tonight and I think, thank you.

634
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,395
Thank you, you. Thank you, you.
Thank you, you.

If somebody wanted a cock
enlargement, I'd be there.

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,033
Amber Swallows, how much money
have we made tonight?

638
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,154
The total amount is...

639
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,599
£4,260!

640
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
I like to think that I own like
a little piece of her nipple.

641
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,919
It belongs to me.

642
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,396
- What about Africa?
- Kids in Africa.

643
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,670
Somalian droughts!

644
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,077
OK,
this is trans community spirit.

645
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,275
This is people that give a shit
about other people.

646
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,790
Amber! Amber! Amber!

647
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,919
<i>- </i> She didn't!
- She did!

648
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,396
I thought she was taking
the piss.

649
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,195
I've just had
my life-changing operation,

650
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,039
which is my boobies.

651
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,879
Bearing in mind
that this is the first time

652
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,550
that I've seen them as well,
so let's see...

653
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,599
..what's happened,

654
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,792
and where that boobathon money
has been spent.

655
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,073
Ta-da!

656
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,800
Amber's new girls.

657
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,560
Hello, babies. How are you?

658
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,120
In a way I kind of feel
a bit pissed off

659
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,072
that I've had to pay for them.

660
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,272
Cos really they should have been
here when I was born.

661
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,550
Some people don't like
my kind of people.

662
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,196
And sometimes
you need to take a stand.

663
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,199
Adolf Hitler
was a Roman Catholic.

664
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,673
<i>When the Pope came over,</i>

665
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,950
<i>a lot of people were talking</i>

666
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,753
<i>about wanting to protest
against it.</i>

667
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,998
<i>And so I'd written this rap
called "Pope Benny"</i>

668
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,440
<i>where I made the Pope a Scouser.</i>

669
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,553
- Get your nun's outfit on.
- Alright, alright!

670
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,672
Hi, kids!

671
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,554
I'm dressing up
as the Pope today.

672
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,276
I'm promoting my new hit single,
<i>Rapping at the Vatican.</i>

673
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400

674
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,392
We are going
to Hyde Park Corner,

675

where the protest against
the Pope is happening today.

676
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,072
They're killing all the gays in
Africa, aren't they? They are.

677
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,316
Killing all the bears?

678
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,397
- Killing the gays in Africa.
- Oh God, yeah.

00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,035
On one side of the page

706
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,470
there was a banner that says
"suffer little children"

707
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,432
and on the other side,
there was Jonny.

708

718
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,879

John Sizzle, look at that.
Primark's finest, she is.

725
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,474
Let's read some palms.

726
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,153
You are all gonna have

728

731
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,032

You're the shaky drunk.
Obviously. What's your name?

735
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,156
I just want to go home to bed.
I want to forget all about this.

736
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,000
Put it down to experience.
Happens to all the greats.

737
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,238
<i>The thing with John,
John always battles</i>

738
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,397
with this idea that he shouldn't
be a drag queen.

739
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,515
We've got this wonderful DJ
booth. It's crystal encrusted.

740
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,109
So he's always kind of pretended

741
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,072
not to really like
being a drag queen.

742
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,113
She didn't want it. She wanted
to be on full display.

743
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,356
Between you and me,
I have got quite a gash.

744
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,915
I think
drag's got a shelf life, right?

745
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,918
Eyes down for a line,
come on, let's go.

746
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,111
I need
some methadrone immediately.

747
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,038
<i>You ask most drag queens.</i>

748
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,279
<i>I don't think they wanna do this
in their mid to late 40s.</i>

749
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,471
<i>I am looking for an escape.</i>

750
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,035
Should I be taking this down
to here?

751
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,153
<i>So I'm doing upholstery. This is
going back to what I used to do.</i>

753
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,797

Bit of shabby chic.

754
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,037
<i>Just nice, isn't it?</i>

755
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,800
<i>Just the idea of pottering
around in a dusty old shed.</i>

756
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,833
Like, you know,
stuffing old pouffes.

757
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,795
What's my name again? Ofrah.

758
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,277
Oh God.

759
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,398
Lovebox is really... It's good

760
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,160

it's a culmination

761

<i>of lots of things I've been
doing over the past few years.</i>

762
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,955
So from a personal level,
that's very kind of gratifying.

763
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,039
We're performing to thousands
and thousands of people.

764
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,475
<i>So in the back of your mind

765
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,557
gonna lead on to something
bigger and better.

766
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,912
Jonny, he still should cross
over into the mainstream.

767
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,633
Out of all the things I've done,

768
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,229
this is probably
the biggest thing I've done.

769
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,754

is going to be to 15,000.

Part of the woods

824
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,717
where I used
to procure married men

825
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,309

of their dignity.

826
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,235
Everybody knew
that John was gay except me.

827
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,476

829
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,035
I never seen him
wearing my clothes.

830
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,000
I can see the exact tree
where I lost my virginity.

831
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,638
I mean, the thing is, like,
you know,

832
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,674
people don't understand
the idea of cottaging.

833
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,393
Heterosexual people
don't understand

834

the idea of cottaging.

835
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,034
And they see it as like...
like dirty homosexuals

836
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,197
and their lust
for cheap and nasty sex

837
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,155
in parks and places
where there are hedgehogs.

838
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,670
It was the love
that dare not speak its name

839
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,995
because you got into trouble.

840
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,793
You couldn't walk around
holding hands.

841
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,957
I remember in the '90s
and my boyfriend

842
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,390
and getting stopped
by the police

843
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,718
for kissing him in the snow
outside a theatre in town.

844
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,876
It was really romantic.

845
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,839
I mean, nobody could ask
for a better son, actually.

846
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,040
I think a lot of people

847
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,392
would be jealous
if they had a son like mine.

848
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,796
<i>There was no way
for me to meet gay men.</i>

849
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,879
<i>And so you met people furtively</i>

850
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,674
<i>and I think even though
we were having sex,</i>

851
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,473
a lot of the time
it was just about contact.

852
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,910
It wasn't just about
getting your rocks off

853
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,238
with some 70-year-old
who looks like Rod Stewart.

854
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,351
He came out with it
and said, "I'm gay."

855
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,793
And I said, "If you promise me
you don't go near the parks,

856
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,116
you know,
these seedy type things,

857
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,153
cos you get beaten up,

858
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,112
I'm quite happy."

859
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,951
I think I slept with
about 1,000 people in two years

860
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,357
<i>when I first started.
I was addicted.</i>

861
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,278
Nothing like a bit of cheap sex.

862
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,757
Hello, tree! Remember me?

863
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,916
I remember you!

864
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,432
This, like, middle-aged guy,
like, blond hair and a mac

865
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,029
whisked me up here

866
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,358
and then he fucked me
up against this very tree.

867
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,119
It didn't even hurt,
I was loving it.

868
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,438
I was literally like a cat
clawing at the bark.

869
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,280
I think about a month later,
I was going to work on the tube,

870
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,839
and opposite me was him,
his wife and two kids.

871
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,474
He was still wearing
the same mac.

872
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,356
I realised the first time that
men are quite possibly shit.

873
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,520
And the gay scene is going to be
really dicey.

874
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,998
It didn't put me off though.

875
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,190
Goodbye, tree.

876
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,757
<i>♪ I'm a big daddy tom
with a big daddy cock</i>

877
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,271
<i>♪ And daddy
is looking for his boy</i>

878
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,754
<i>Pia, really,
of all the clan, she's the one</i>

879
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,190
that's the most,
I suppose, invisible now.

880
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,312
Pia, I haven't seen Pia
for donkey's.

881
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,118
I've stopped taking hormones
because erm...

882
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,072
My intention this year
is to get castrated.

883
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,434
<i>She's one of these people</i>

884
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,075
<i>that doesn't wanna conform
and be a woman.</i>

885
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,477
<i>She wants to be this amazing
trans creation that she is.</i>

886
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,957
I just started to get hairy
again, which is really horrible.

887
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,436
<i>My boobs are less full
and I'm losing my ass.</i>

888
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,076
<i>I've lost two inches off my ass
which is sort of quite alarming.</i>

889
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,953
<i>It was a vote against vanity.</i>

890
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,113
<i>She had to do her own thing.</i>

891
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,594
<i>Speaking to a few people,</i>

892
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,757
it sounded
like that was for the best.

893
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,392
I'm clearing the decks
for the dissolution of mankind

894
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,840
to all intents and purpose.

895
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,639
There are huge changes afoot
with the actual earth

896
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,433
possibly will turn end to end.

897
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,630
You could be on top of Everest

898
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,160
with two miles of water
on your head.

899
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,718
Everything that we know
as physics is wrong.

900
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,038
There is a very interesting
radio transmitter called Harp.

901
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,277
Point this thing at the earth,

902
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,110
you can create a huge bass note
which makes the earth vibrate.

903
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,472
To be honest, I think a lot

904
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,914
<i>of Pia's conspiracy theories
are drug related.</i>

905
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,440
<i>It's a shame.</i>

906
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,155
<i>I don't think
the world's gonna end this year.</i>

907
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,876
It's gonna drag on.
I'll say when it's gonna end.

908
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,232
<i>I haven't
really broached the subject</i>

909
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,079
<i>with a lot of the performers.</i>

910
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,671
<i>Generally people on the street
tend to raise an eyebrow.</i>

911
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,713
She could be right. She'll
be there on her narrowboat,

912
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,877
drifting away with her cats,

913
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,311
going, "Fuck you, you ignorant
twats, you didn't listen to me."

914
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,352
People have been walking around
with boards on

915
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,712
saying the end is nigh
for bloody years.

916
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,355
There's nothing new, darling.

917
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,232
<i>Yeah,

00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,271

I was right. Sorry.

940
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,560
Hopefully try to bring him

941
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,592
At the end of the day
he's my dad

942
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,518
and I'd like to be his friend.

943
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,956
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Dad?

944
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,356
<i>Hello?</i>

945
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,598
Hi, it's me, Amber.
Hello, you OK?

946
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
<i>Yeah.</i>

947
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,520
Ah. I've not spoken to you
for a long time.

948
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,678
- It's my birthday tomorrow.
<i>- Tomorrow? I know.</i>

949
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,110
So if you want,
maybe we can meet up?

950
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,392
Go and have a bite to eat? Yeah.

951
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,039
OK. You're not gonna
get freaked out, are you?

952
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,590
<i>Huh?</i>

953
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,360
I said, you're not gonna get
freaked out, are you?

954
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,910
I look a little bit different
from the last time you seen me.

955
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,710
Huh?

956
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,198
- You'll have to put up with it?
<i>- Hello?</i>

957
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,671
You'll have to put up with it?
Yeah, I think you will.

958
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,952
You'll have to just
put up with me, I'm afraid.

959
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,838
There's a lot of sadness
just to think, you know,

960
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,758
of all the shit
that happened here.

961
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,873
<i>And then he starts to rub
himself up against me.</i>

962
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,755
<i>And so I start to rub myself up
against him.</i>

963
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,191
<i>And I'm not touching him cos
I remember thinking to myself,</i>

964
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,438
if I touch him, that's
the thing that makes me gay.

965
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,472
A lot of my sexual experiences

966
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,320
happened around about
the age of 12 to 15.

967
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,671
And they happened in these sheds

968
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,757
that are kind of
around the estate.

969
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:09,160
And the local boys would do
what they wanted with me.

970
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,876
It's interesting that woman just
looked back and laughed at me.

971
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,515
I went to school with her son.

972
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,280
<i>I don't say anything</i>

973
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,153
cos I've never spoken
to a policeman before

974
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,430
so I'm petrified.

975
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,473
<i>"We're arresting you on
suspicion of buggery and rape."</i>

976
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,910
I'm 13 years old.

977
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,834
On an estate,
news travels quick, very quick.

978
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,474
Erm...

979
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,356
And it got out here
that I'd had sex with a guy

980
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,199
when I was 13.

981
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,870
And then that got warped into
"he's a rapist".

982
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,959
And then to be a gay rapist
was the worst thing.

983
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,278
Like the worst thing
that you could possibly be.

984
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,792
They ask me to stand up
and so I do.

985
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,879
<i>And they say to me,
"You're free to go."</i>

986
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,998
I was free to go.

987
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,316
<i>I was never allowed
to go back into education</i>

988
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,160
<i>because I was a risk
to the other students.</i>

989
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,351
<i>My mum had to deal with
death threats on my life</i>

990
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,314
<i>and I was branded a rapist
on my estate.</i>

991
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,157
But I was free to go.

992
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,239
And with this show, you know,
I've toured it round the world.

993
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,558
<i>It's won awards,
it's got great reviews.</i>

994
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,275
<i>And then I brought it to London</i>

995
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,914
and I brought it
to the Roundhouse,

996
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,636
which is literally
on the edge of the estate.

997
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,231
And I guess
I feel that weird fear again.

998
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,670
Like maybe
they're gonna tell me off. Who?

999
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,759
What's this weird thing
that I'm worried about?

1000
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,872
<i>I constantly worry.</i>

1001
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,516
<i>I don't want to carry around
any form of shame any more.</i>

1002
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,755
<i>I need to let this shit go.</i>

1003
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,752
There's a fat girl in the corner

1004
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,792
And she's the office clown

1005
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,072
The life and soul of parties,
never easy to weigh down

1006
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,317
She can count her friends
on one hand

1007
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,272
She knows who to trust

1008
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,359
The plump girl in HR,
the boys at school cussed

1009
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,358
There's a fat girl in the corner

1010
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,358
She's been like it
since her teens

1011
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,871
She blames her mum's side
for the obese gene

1012
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,198
Hair is always pristine,
flawless maquillage

1013
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,915
Underneath the war paint,
a broken facade

1014
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,360
There's a fat girl in the corner

1015
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,199
And for once she's had enough

1016
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,754
Things have gone pear shaped

1017
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,996
She wants someone to love

1018
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,875
Overworked, overeaten,
and overweight

1019
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,754
A 20-something fat cat
who never got her bait

1020
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,271
There's a fat girl in the corner
and now she's deceased

1021
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,598
Went down the wrong hole,
her midnight feast

1022
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,473
She ate a box of doughnuts

1023
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,512
She shoved them down her throat

1024
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,552
The thing that killed her was

1025
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,558
The thing she loved the most

1026
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,956
Does anybody want a flyer
for my show?

1027
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,072
Would anybody like a flyer
for my show?

1028
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,914
That is about as involved
as my pitch is.

1029
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,157
Hello, would you like to come
and see my show?

1030
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,279
Hello! No, another no.

1031
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,154
I'm not fulfilling my potential.
I've kind of sold myself short.

1032
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,112
<i>That is when
I get really depressed.</i>

1033
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,152
<i>There's been a lot of boys
with their pants down</i>

1034
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,192
<i>to get attention.</i>

1035
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,515
Hello, darling, how are you?

1036
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,836
- Very well, how are you?
- I'm very good.

1037
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,114
I hate it.

1038
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,039
Stars, stars, stars, stars.

1039
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,632
That's what everyone wants,
stars.

1040
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,917
Desperate for reviews.

1041
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,520
For the stars.

1042
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,190
Roll up, roll up, ladies
and gentlemen, don't be shy.

1043
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,880
Am I lying in the gutter
looking at the stars?

1044
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,758
No, I'm face down in the gutter.

1045
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,511
With my ass in the air.

1046
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,077
New show, twisted drama
set in an abattoir.

1047
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,510
Slaughterhouse comedy.
New play.

1048
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,279
How did you end up
coming here anyway?

1049
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,756
For the last year we've been
developing the show

1050
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,880
and it's been touring.

1051
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,590
You're planning your world tour.
Last night was alright.

1052
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,552
The night before
I had nine people in.

1053
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,718
- Soul destroying, isn't it?
- I just didn't need it.

1054
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,560
- Soul destroying.
- I slit my wrists the next day.

1055
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,120
I think if I want to push myself

1056
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,553
to be at the top of what
I see as being top of my game,

1057
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,434
this isn't the top of my game.

1058
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,551
It's the last day, anyway,
I don't care.

1059
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,151
I am over it!

1060
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,878
Let's get out of here.

1061
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,950
<i>♪ So you ask me</i>

1062
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,079
<i>♪ Are you happy with your life?</i>

1063
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,999
So I'm sitting at the estuary
of the River Medway,

1064
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:05,912
and just slightly to the north
is the village where I grew up.

1065
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,795
Being here actually it feels
very, very comforting.

1066
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,831
I feel like
I could stay here forever.

1067
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,953
It's quite peculiar.

1068
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,436
You could literally just
leave me here and I could become

1069
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,597
like one of these boats.

1070
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,871
I feel like
I should be more successful.

1071
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,640
I feel like
I've wasted a lot of time.

1072
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,638
I think I've done myself
a lot of damage.

1073
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,198
And I have to deal with that

1074
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,277
and I have to take
responsibility for that.

1075
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,995
I could have been more
successful but I made choices.

1076
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,316
I spent a lot of time
doing lots of ecstasy.

1077
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,671
My memory's shot.
My memory's fucked up.

1078
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,712
I can't remember shit.

1079
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,753
I'm fairly happy. I haven't
fulfilled the potential

1080
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,712
that I think that I have.

1081
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,877
And the ability that I have.

1082
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,560
I really feel like
I've got to pull my finger out.

1083
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,236
Oh, my God.
I was diagnosed HIV positive

1084
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,353
I think
seven or eight years ago.

1085
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,632
I can't remember which. Erm...

1086
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,639
Oh God, it was awful.
It was the single worst thing

1087
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,638
that's ever happened to me
in my whole life.

1088
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,119
And I've buried a parent.

1089
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,675
So it was worse,
a lot worse than that.

1090
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,120
Erm...

1091
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,916
It was shock. It was just
complete and utter shock.

1092
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,829
And I think you hear people
use the word "devastated" a lot.

1093
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,838
They don't know
what they're talking about.

1094
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,031
Yeah. They don't know
what they're talking about.

1095
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,154
"I was devastated.
Oh my God. I was devastated."

1096
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,317
You know. No, you weren't.

1097
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,200
When you have your whole...

1098
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,676
When it feels like your whole...

1099
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,835
Everything you've understood
about yourself and your life

1100
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,398
has been removed from you,
that's basically how I felt.

1101
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,989
It was really shocking.

1102
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,635
I joke about it
as much as possible.

1103
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,433
I think probably too much.

1104
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,600
I think bit of gallows humour.
It disarms people, I think.

1105
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,235
<i>What percentage of people
do I know are HIV?</i>

1106
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,591
<i>Of my close friends...</i>

1107
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,999
God. Probably 40 or 50 per cent.

1108
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,150
And counting.

1109
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,749
<i>There's a good chance
that you'll get it.</i>

1110
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,354
If you've been doing your job
properly, you should get it.

1111
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,517
Come on.

1112
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,317
<i>My father and my uncle
are five minutes away.</i>

1113
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,398
One second,
I need to pull my all-in-one

1114
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,194
fucking body shape up.
It's falling down.

1115
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,874
Just what you wear
to meet your dad

1116
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,798
when you've not seen him
for years,

1117
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,354
when you've actually
changed sex.

1118
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,030
This is the outfit
that you wear. Oh!

1119
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,674
See you soon. Bye. Bye.

1120
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,872
That's my uncle.
He called me Amber.

1121
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,757
So not only have I got my dad
to deal with,

1122
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,556
I've got my uncle as well who
again I have not seen for years.

1123
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,037
I think he might be embarrassed
to be with me in the street.

1124
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,799
Oh, my God!

1125
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,311
Oh, my God.
They're gonna knock in a second.

1126
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,638
They're gonna knock on the door
in a second.

1127
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,949
Come on.

1128
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,596
Hi! You OK? Come on.

1129
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,554
Come on in. Come on in.
Hi, you OK?

1130
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,074
No, not much, no.

1131
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,431
How are you both?
Are you alright?

1132
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,597
- Very good.
- Come on in. Come on.

1133
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,280
- Have you been here before?
- Have I heck been here before.

1134
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,629
You've not been here before.

1135
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,391
It was Amber's father's idea
to come down and... and stay.

1136
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,070
And I think it was
a little window of opportunity

1137
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,839
to break the ice myself.

1138
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,431
- So this is the kitchen?
- This is the bathroom, yeah.

1139
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,000
My dad is so nervous.
I thought I was nervous,

1140
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,554
but he's more nervous than me.

1141
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,594
Just came in and started talking
about my boiler straightaway.

1142
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,918
- And what's this here?
- A toilet.

1143
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,032
I'm making eye contact with him.
He looks...

1144
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,120
I'm really happy. Really,
really pleased that he's here.

1145
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,074
Where does your television go?

1146
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,271
Well, it can go on there.
Be alright, won't it?

1147
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,959
Oh, aye, yeah.

1148
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,470
It's going to be a shock,
you know.

1149
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,718
It was Dean, now it's Amber,
and he's got to get used to it.

1150
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,114
You can take a man
out of Manchester

1151
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,277
but not Manchester
out of the man.

1152
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,196
£30? It was a tenner, that.

1153
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,752
You bought it off a shoplifter.

1154
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,111
What do you do, drink it with
the alarm still on it?

1155
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,199
Shall I show that to the police?

1156
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,799
It's a joke.

1157
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,000
Seriously, you want me to speak,
proper?

1158
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,600
- What I've got to say?
- Yeah.

1159
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,156
That's it. Alright.

1160
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,432
Mirror, mirror, on the wall

1161
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,951

look this beautiful?

My body's falling apart.
Drag is giving me rickets.

1174
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,998
We're here for John Sizzle's
45th birthday.

1175
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,758
John Sizzle
shouldn't give up drag

1176
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,234
because otherwise there would be

1177
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,750
nowhere for all
that bitterness to go.

1178
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,318
<i>He'll say
he's doing it for money.</i>

1179
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,874
<i>I think he's enjoying it.</i>

1180
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,912
Sizzle has paved the way for us.

1181
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,872
That's fucking cava.

1182
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,035
So, John Sizzle, you're 45.

1183
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,117
- Ish.
- Apparently.

1184
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,436
- Are you giving up drag?
- Fuck you all.

1185
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,074
- No!
- No!

1186
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,793
- D'you know what...
- No!

1187
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,639
Yes! Yes!

1188
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,280
Do I have a choice?

1189
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,959
No!

1190
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,356
Cheers.

1191
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,949
To tights! To tights!

1192
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,757
Just about to perform my
brand-new track

1193
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,714
for the birthday boy
called <i>Ten Star Hotel.</i>

1194
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,356
He's gonna get a fresh insight
into my new body.

1195
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:29,076
So there is no more
keep the peace any more.

1196
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,760
It is about to be
World War Three.

1197
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,270
They don't call it a transition
for no reason.

1198
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,318
<i>♪ Yeah, you were cruising

1224
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,233
Happy birthday, John Sizzle.

1225
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,913
<i>Allegedly, I said
I was giving up drag today.</i>

1226
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,033
<i>By today. And I haven't.</i>

1227
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,597
And here I am at 45 doing
what I swore I wouldn't do.

1228
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,430
<i>I'm gonna do a gig, Saturday
night, and earn some money.</i>

1229
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:57,116
But ultimately
it is a young person's game.

1230
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,994
I think Jonny Woo's also in a
transitional moment in his life.

1231
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,077
<i>You need to be glamorous.</i>

1232
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,036
I don't mind the fact that
I'm 45 and doing it so much

1233
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,631
because ultimately
I'm a show-off.

1234
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,672
45 and still alive.

1235
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,158
And the gigs
have actually freed me up

1236
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,839
to do what I wanna do.

1237
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,553
Upholstery
and all this sort of stuff.

1238
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,474
<i>Everyone else
works their tits off.</i>

1239
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:32,231
Spending their whole life typing
for their pensions.

1240
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,512
And here I am expressing myself,
basically.

1241
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,350
Sexsational. Relevant.

1242
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,710
Challenging.

1243
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,596
Mwah.

1244
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,720
Fab.

1245
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,514
Whoops. I think
I might be a transvestite.

1246
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,591
So what I'm doing is...

1247
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,999
my ten years of drag show
called <i>Sorry I'm A Lady.</i>

1248
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,396
Rather than just do it
in a cabaret space,

1249
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,796
I thought this would be a more
interesting place to do it

1250
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,596
because I can sit here and do
my make-up before the show

1251
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,076
and be a kind of
art installation.

1252
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,520
Woo-ee! Hey!

1253
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,757
The idea being
every time I put my make-up on

1254
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,758
it's kind of sculptural.

1255
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,793
I'm sculpting right now.
I'm painting.

1256
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,994
Trying to create a masterpiece.

1257
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,392
There's something I've got

1258
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,113
Depression

1259
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,838
I was different

1260
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,031
An eccentric child.

1261
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,790
Not pretty, sporty or popular.

1262
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,673
I didn't know that

1263
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,520
Thought I was normal

1264
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,156
Singled out for being different

1265
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,274
I have depression and I've
had depression for a long time.

1266
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,960
<i>We don't talk about it.
Everything's fabulous.</i>

1267
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,959
<i>The world of drag, everyone's
fabulous and no one's ill.</i>

1268
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,198
No one gets hurt or injured.
It's all fabulous.

1269
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,152
<i>It's like, well, no,
we're human.</i>

1270
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,511
<i>You do it
because you love to show off.</i>

1271
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,552
The bullying got worse

1272
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,911
The depression got worse

1273
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,078
Until at the age of 15

1274
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,640
I...

1275
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,237
attempted...

1276
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,919
suicide

1277
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,239
I might be in therapy and on
pills for the rest of my life.

1278
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,397
I've accepted that. It's shit.

1279
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,159
<i>I have my moments
when I'm catatonic</i>

1280
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,760
<i>and I don't want
to speak to anybody.</i>

1281
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,473
<i>And they're horrible times</i>

1282
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,750
and they're dark times.

1283
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,679
I'm on the verge of suicide
and it's awful.

1284
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,793
However, there's this.

1285
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,436
<i>I'm actually quite suicidal
most days.</i>

1286
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,677
<i>I honestly don't think people
would care.</i>

1287
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,076
<i>People would go "Oh" for a week.</i>

1288
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,433
On Facebook. "Oh, she's dead."
And that would be it.

1289
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,357
<i>There's not much to live for,
really.</i>

1290
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,278
<i>I try and make my life</i>

1291
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,631
as colourful as possible
while I'm still here.

1292
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,390
Cos one day I will go.
Simple as that.

1293
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,473
And that's that.

1294
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,989

<i>is where we left off last.</i>

1313
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,031
The last kind of time I met you

1314
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,595
I think I was a bit mental!

1315
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,440
<i>And since then
I got in contact with my family.</i>

1316
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,473
<i>My mum's six months in AA
and my dad's four months in AA.</i>

1317
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,637
And their life
has completely changed.

1318
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,519
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!

1319
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,677
Welcome to Burger Queen!

1320
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,951
Scottee's just working,
isn't he?

1321
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,878
He's just doing
more and more shows.

1322
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,231
<i>He works very hard.
He's being very prolific</i>

1323
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,432
and has become a very competent,
charming performer.

1324
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,870
Yes, well, we have,
of course, Lisa Stansfield.

1325
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,639
Don't piss on my parade, bitch.

1326
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,240
<i>I've stopped partying</i>

1327
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:23,194
and I've really focused
on my work, I guess.

1328
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,631
<i>I feel like life is kind of
finally settling down.</i>

1329
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,955
Yeah, I do.
It's good. I can say that.

1330
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,514
We are all the outsiders.

1331
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,030
Everybody in this room
is an outsider.

1332
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,232
We are all fat
and we all are quite fantastic.

1333
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,397
Lisa Stansfield, you are fat.

1334
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,513
And welcome to the fat club.

1335
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,950
<i>You know, growing up here,
coming out was never an option.</i>

1336
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,356
<i>You become the runt. You become
the runt of the litter.</i>

1337
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,800
<i>Well, I was.</i>

1338
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,877
<i>The reason why I do what I do</i>

1339
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,198
<i>and why I'm such a show-off
and why I'm so determined</i>

1340
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:04,270
<i>to be seen
and to be outlandish and outré</i>

1341
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,552
is because I wasn't able to...

1342
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,718
I wasn't able to be that
when I was growing up.

1343
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,400
I was always the faggot.

1344
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,399
<i>If we look into the psychology,</i>

1345
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,912
we're all, all of us,
we're desperate for attention.

1346
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,475
And we're desperate
to articulate ourselves

1347
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,071
now that we know we can't
be fucking bullied any more.

1348
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,079
You know, I'm gonna get on stage
and wear a sequin outfit.

1349
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,590
Nobody's gonna call me fat and
nobody's gonna call me queer.

1350
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,791
If they do,
they're gonna get chucked out

1351
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,755
and get a lot of hassle from me.
Because now I'm in control

1352
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,156
and I think that's what
it's about. It's about control.

1353
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,832
<i>A friend of mine has had
it done. 175 for three areas.</i>

1354
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,031
<i>She did mine</i>

1355
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,117
and this bad frown line
just didn't go, did it?

1356
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,960
I didn't like our Cher
with Botox.

1357
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,673
Like surprised looking.

1358
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,080
She looks Chinesefied.
Can't she? Chinesefied.

1359
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,035
My family are not strangers to
a little bit of a nip and tuck.

1360
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,594
<i>I think there's a competition</i>

1361
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,473
who's got the biggest tits
at the moment!

1362
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,432
And I seem to be winning.

1363
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,359
Have you seen my boobs?
I'll show you how big there are.

1364
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,597
- God!
- They're gorgeous.

1365
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:20,270
- What size?
- 36F.

1366
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,711
36F. I want to go 34DD,
what I used to be.

1367
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,036
Are you two gonna have
a joint boob job together?

1368
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,038
- Do you get a discount?
- Yeah.

1369
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,833
It's gonna be on the sale
of the property.

1370
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,317
That's what Cher's boob job
is done. When we've sold this.

1371
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,400
She's getting hers done.

1372
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,958
You know the person who did your
surgery when I come to see you.

1373
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,635
I wouldn't mind using...

1374
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,353
- Him for your facelift?
- Yes.

1375
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,551
This is only three months.

1376
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,798
He did a fantastic job on you.
Yeah, you can see it.

1377
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,152
I can see my mum in you
a little bit there.

1378
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,712
I'm up in Manchester for a while
to be closer to my family.

1379
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,231
<i>It's going to be more easy
for them and more easy for me</i>

1380
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,192
<i>if I've got more connection
with them.</i>

1381
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,437
I've got friends of mine
going through transitions

1382
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,199
and their families
have disowned them.

1383
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,314
<i>Alright, I'll see you
in about 45 minutes.</i>

1384
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,796
<i>Don't be too long, Dean.
Er, Amber.</i>

1385
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,240
Alright.

1386
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,831
<i>My dad. Just slipped up again.</i>

1387
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,316
This is the reason
for kind of like being up here.

1388
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,830
<i>It takes time, you know.</i>

1389
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,434
All's I ever do
is bloody put make-up on.

1390
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,640
Right, go on.

1391
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,959
What have you made?

1392
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,434
There's some chips an' that.

1393
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,758
Asparagus, peas,
chips, carrots, pork.

1394
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,835
The dog and everything.

1395
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,518
- Her dog, Ruby.
- That's <i>her</i> dog.

1396
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,836
So how's everything been?
Alright?

1397
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,714
Yeah, I've just got
a new place in Manchester.

1398
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,514
I want to be back
near my family, you know.

1399
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,759
Cos I'm having my operation
soon, aren't I? In March.

1400
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,952
Yep, biggest operation
of my life.

1401
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,951
Can't do anything. Can't have
sex for six months.

1402
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,754
- You can't what?
- Can't have sex for six months.

1403
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,910
Right. Don't be picking at that.
I want you to eat it proper.

1404
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,032
Not like a bit here,
a bit there.

1405
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,160
It's massive.

1406
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,835
I don't give a damn. Get it ate.

1407
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,839
- Is this chicken or pork?
- Pork, that.

1408
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,352
To me, you look the same, to me.

1409
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,800
What, exactly the same person?

1410
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,116
Yes. Always the same person.

1411
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,674
Oh, well, that's nice.

1412
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,473
Physically she looks

1413
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,956
very different from Dean,
doesn't she?

1414
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,151
No, I don't think so. No.

1415
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,350
What do you mean?

1416
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,631
I look exactly the same
as what I used to look like?

1417
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,278
A little bit better?
I look completely different.

1418
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,433
Yeah. OK, fine,
if that's how you perceive me.

1419
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,596
Of course I've not disappeared.
I'm still the same person.

1420
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,720
Of course you are.

1421
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,476
Obviously I've moved on in life.
I've transcended and you know...

1422
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,716
Are you embarrassed?

1423
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,874
You'd stick up for me?
That doesn't happen.

1424
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,831
<i>I hugged him today
so that's a breakthrough.</i>

1425
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,997
He gave me a kiss on the cheek.

1426
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,157
Dean, Amber,
having the operation

1427
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,000
wouldn't make
any difference to me whatsoever.

1428
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,750
To me, she's a girl. Obviously
she's changed that way.

1429
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,554
But to me,
it's still my flesh and blood

1430
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,239
and that's all there is to it.

1431
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,750
<i>So it makes no difference,
the operation, whatsoever.</i>

1432
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,633
It's immaterial.

1433
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,639
It takes time but gets easier
and easier, you know.

1434
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,160
That's how it should go.

1435
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,157
<i>Erm... I bought a boat.</i>

1436
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,192
It was a kneejerk reaction

1437
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,119
to me thinking they were gonna
blow the Olympics up.

1438
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,516
<i>- </i> Who's they?
- The Archons.

1439
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,190
Shape-shifting evil wrongdoers

1440
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,438
that are trying
to enslave the human race.

1441
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,280
They didn't blow the Olympics up
which was very nice

1442
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,436
and pleasing.

1443
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,276
But, you know,
I don't know any more.

1444
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,710
I'm just sounding more and more
mad as time goes by.

1445
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,990
But I don't really mind.

1446
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,874
I stopped taking my hormones

1447
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,435
even though they were making me
very happy.

1448
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,836
I didn't feel happy
being content,

1449
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,394
which sounds really stupid

1450
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,637
but the reason that everybody's
sad at the moment

1451
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,355
is because half the planet
are starving.

1452
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,393
And me glossing over that
with medication

1453
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,831
doesn't really seem to be
the answer to my problems.

1454
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,471
If I'm screaming from
the rooftops to feed everybody,

1455
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,911
then maybe that's more helpful
than me grinning away inanely

1456
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,997
being happy with tits.

1457
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,511
Do you miss tits
and things like that?

1458
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,270
Greatly. I miss running around
without my clothes on

1459
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,039
<i>and dancing a lot.</i>

1460
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,879
<i>I really miss dancing.</i>

1461
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,120
<i>I miss that terribly.</i>

1462
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,310
<i>You can still do that.</i>

1463
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,035
I don't feel like I can
any more.

1464
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,834
<i>- </i> Why's that?
- Because I'm too sad.

1465
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,120
Erm... Give us a minute.

1466
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,392
Is that because
of the state of the world?

1467
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,150
Because of the state of me.
Erm...

1468
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,398
<i>What I desperately want
is for everything</i>

1469
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,558
<i>to be like it was
five years ago.</i>

1470
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,354
<i>Because I was a lot happier.
It was great fun.</i>

1471
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,114
You know?

1472
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,680
<i>I need to make more of an effort
with my life.</i>

1473
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,874
<i>I can't talk about anybody
in their life and what they do.</i>

1474
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,435
I'm no fucking angel.

1475
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,438
I'm...

1476
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,754
..lost.

1477
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,878
It's only now in hindsight

1478
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,789
having made the decision
to stop drinking,

1479
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:58,473
that I can now look back
and see that the behaviour

1480
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,355
after a massive hospitalisation
that risked my life

1481
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,312
and tore my family to pieces

1482
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,272
and kind of shocked
all my friends

1483
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,278
was the behaviour of someone

1484
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,632
who was desperately in need
of help for their drinking.

1485
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,831
<i>For me now the party's over.</i>

1486
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:19,473
<i>Do I choose the booze
and the drugs and death?</i>

1487
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,478
<i>And I'm not exaggerating.</i>

1488
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,672
<i>Do I choose that
or do I choose a career?</i>

1489
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,076
<i>Do I choose friends,</i>

1490
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,350
do I choose relationships

1491
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,712
and do I choose
a really great future?

1492
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,560
You've done the Winter Olympics.
The sledge.

1493
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,320
Then you've got to go off.

1494
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,840
You've got to get changed
quickly.

1495
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,838
We have sold 1,200 tickets.

1496
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,553
They've opened parts
of the theatre

1497
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,036
that normally would not be open
for any other kind of event.

1498
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,038
They've only opened them
because we told them

1499
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,594
we have to make
some bloody money.

1500
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,120
We're not making
a fucking penny.

1501
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,754
I don't know
how these shows work.

1502
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,475
- OK, that's it.
- Whoo!

1503
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,035
Arms outstretched.

1504
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,551
Keep straight.
And then turn on the spot.

1505
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,951
I've got a feeling
this is probably it.

1506
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,037
It can't get bigger than this,
can it?

1507
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,758
I feel stronger.
I feel much more capable

1508
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:17,476
of delivering the show
that's coming up.

1509
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,069
I haven't seen a lot
of the other queens

1510
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,634
for a very long time.

1511
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,639
<i>I think it's sad, yeah.
I think it's sad.</i>

1512
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,071
So Mike Leigh's popping down
at some point to see the show.

1513
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,920
<i>I've become a broadcaster.</i>

1514
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,918
<i>BBC Radio 4, nonetheless.</i>

1515
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:37,637
<i>I think the scene is a little
fucked up at the moment.</i>

1516
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,275
Everyone has got
this weird feeling

1517
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,392
that there's one golden ticket.

1518
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:47,197
And like only one drag queen
can make it.

1519
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,836
<i>But with that it kind of breeds
this weird competitive vileness</i>

1520
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:58,433
<i>where everyone's fighting
for the same limelight.</i>

1521
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,678
Yeah, my ideals are now all
based around happiness.

1522
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,192
Just want to be happy.

1523
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:19,356
It's completely sold out.
It's a huge moment.

1524
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:21,199
Moment in gay culture
in east London.

1525
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,232
Jackie, I'm your biggest fan.

1526
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,672
I'm here to interview
the poor people

1527
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,200
who they cannot come in

1528
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:32,279
because they didn't have money
to buy a ticket before.

1529
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,072
This is the Hackney Empire!

1530
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,351
How are we doing tonight?
Are we there?

1531
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,550
Yeah!

1532
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,360
They're not gonna stop.

1533
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,711
They're gonna be like Cher.
They'll keep going.

1534
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,990
And they ain't done yet.

1535
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,159
Good luck, everybody!

1536
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,512
<i>This is the final night of Gay
Bingo. Ten years of Gay Bingo.</i>

1537
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,360
We are in the principal
cast members' dressing room.

1538
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,632

1539

1540
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,154
I hear Chris Stein's
gonna turn up apparently.

1541
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,359
It's a scary gig tonight.

1542
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,870
<i>It's nerve-racking, isn't it?</i>

1543
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,799
<i>Gay Bingo, yeah.
Everyone's on this gig.</i>

1544
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,639
<i>And the audience like that,
don't they?</i>

1545
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,160
<i>They perceive us as individuals</i>

1546
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,431
<i>that, together,
make a bigger whole.</i>

1547
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,792

I'm really enjoying it.
I can see my mum and my sister.

01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,074
<i>My mum's looking a bit bemused.</i>

1558
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,760
I think she's upset that we're
not playing proper bingo.

Let's go.

1565
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,473
I've no idea where Amber is.

1566
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,557
Wouldn't like to comment
where Amber could be.

1567
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,993
She's been louche,
she's gone shopping with Pia.

1568
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,952
She's gone to see a friend.

1569
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,754
Oh, a special friend. Right.

1570
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,351
- Amber's here? No!
- How are you?

1571
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,831
Didn't Mr Surgeon do well
