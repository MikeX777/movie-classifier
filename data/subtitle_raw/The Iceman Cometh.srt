1
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,970
Princess.

2
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,350
That Feng San dared rape and
kill Princess Nan Chiang.

3
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,820
Princess Nan Chiang is my cousin.

4
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,030
Yet she got raped and killed.

5
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,660
How can I face my ancestors?

6
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,010
Take care of yourself, your Majesty.

7
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,040
Your Majesty.

8
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,680
Feng Sau Ching is
head of Royal Guard.

9
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,220
He is to patrol the city,

10
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,650
but he let his colleague Feng San
do all these crimes.

11
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,550
So I beg your Majesty
to have him punished.

12
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,360
I didn't let Feng San do that.

13
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,560
Only that Feng San is really cunning
and he's skilled at martial art.

14
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,690
If you lie to me.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
I'll kill all your family.

16
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,870
I'll have you head cut off openly.

17
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,070
Spare me your Majesty.

18
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,210
Hold it.

19
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,080
Hold it.

20
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,320
I take as granted that you've
follow me a long time.

21
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,690
I allow you to do something
to cover your negligence.

22
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,980
I give you 20 days
to capture Feng San.

23
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,460
Thanks your Majesty,
I'll capture Feng San within 20 days.

24
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,100
Thanks for sparing me, I'm retreating.

25
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,010
Uncle-instructor.

26
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,190
Uncle-instructor.

27
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,060
How are you?

28
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,200
That betrayer Feng San injured me.

29
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,930
Why did he injure you?

30
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,270
Two nights ago,
Feng San crept back,

31
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,580
and tried to steal
the Black Jade Buddha.

32
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,940
I found it and we fought.

33
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,280
He injured me.

34
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,020
and he stole the Black Jade Buddha.

35
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,930
Why did he steal
the Black Jade Buddha?

36
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,190
According to Buddhism books.

37
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,060
One day Evil went to see Buddha,

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,830
and ask Buddha:
I want to follow you.

39
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,040
Can I be Buddha as
I did so many crimes?

40
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,940
Buddha performed miracle
and turned the Wheel.

41
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,610
Evil sat on it, holding
the Black Jade Buddha, and said prayer.

42
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,920
He saw his whole life 100 times.

43
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,360
Seeing one's life
100 times at instance.

44
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,320
Feng San has nowhere to go.

45
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,520
Maybe he believes this myths.

46
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,690
He wants to make us of
Black Jade Buddha to escape.

47
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,920
He can't as the Wheel is not here.

48
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,800
I know that people from
Tibet have just arrived.

49
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,900
Wheel is one of their presents.

50
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,410
At midnight in 7 days,
it's the miracle day.

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,370
No, I must stop him.

52
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,150
Feng San, you can't run away,
let me arrest you.

53
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,350
Stupid, dog, you come late!

54
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,360
Feng San.

55
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,000
Stupid, dog, are you blind?

56
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,700
Is you brain blocked?

57
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,870
Don't you recognize me?

58
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,510
Our first rule forbids
to commit adultery,

59
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,910
but you raped and killed 13 girls.

60
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,280
Why did you do all these?

61
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,680
Stupid Dog, we started
practicing since 5.

62
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,590
We had to practice at dawn,

63
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,320
and could only sleep at midnight.

64
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,820
It was not human life.

65
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Twenty-five years, we led
such a life for 25 years.

66
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,330
We finally practiced
superb martial art.

67
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,670
So it's harvest time for us.

68
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,040
We should enjoy ourselves.

69
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,600
I feel excited to rape and kill.

70
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,270
You are lunatic!

71
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,320
I must cut off my relation
with you today.

72
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,750
We have no more relation!

73
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,600
Your Majesty.

74
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,080
Though I can't capture Feng San.

75
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,210
But I will kill him.

76
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,380
It is also fulfilling my duty.

77
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,860
I must die too.

78
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,300
Take care of yourself,
your Majesty.

79
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,530
Help.

80
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,700
Someone has an accident.

81
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,470
Quick.

82
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,540
Be quick.

83
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,750
Where is it...

84
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,850
Bring some medicine.
Be careful.

85
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,540
Drag him out
Becarefu...

86
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,050
Easy...

87
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,380
Do me have medicine.

88
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,980
Still okay...

89
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,440
It's a great discovery.

90
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,970
It show that there was
homosexual in ancient time.

91
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,480
Right.

92
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,480
Then means there was
AIDS in ancient time too.

93
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,850
Shit, don't bullshit.

94
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,850
Of course.

95
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,590
In 1887 in Sweden,

96
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,060
someone rescued a frog which
had been frozen for a century.

97
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,590
In 1985 at Berkerly University,

98
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,240
a lotus shot up and it had been
frozen for 2000 years.

99
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,540
By theory.

100
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,640
If we electrocute these two ancient
bodies and they will survive.

101
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,240
Don't bullshit.

102
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,010
Now they are conserved in -10c

103
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,580
If we must rescue them.

104
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,640
Then we must thaw them.

105
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,050
But they will rot if we fail.

106
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,320
We can't take this risk.

107
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,330
We should send them to USA.

108
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
They have better instruments.

109
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,800
What do you think?

110
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,270
Right.

111
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,470
Yes, but we must go altogether.

112
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,580
It's a good chance to go
abroad with national fund.

113
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,740
Right.

114
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,710
I must go.

115
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,320
Me too.

116
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,410
You Li Pang. You want to flee
after slaughtering so many people?

117
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,990
Chai King is your student
so you want to flee.

118
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,980
Don't bullshit.

119
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,090
Our country has not future now.

120
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,250
We must leave altogether.

121
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,160
Don't let the 27 Army hear this,
they will suppress us by tanks.

122
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,030
Don't worry.

123
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,270
I've expressed
my support of the Central.

124
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,070
We're skilled at telling lies.

125
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,740
No one will suspect me.

126
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,870
We'll say
we sent the body to USA,

127
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,680
but we will kill Wue Kaixi.

128
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,280
And say we love our father land.

129
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,250
That bastard Li Pang
will surely allow us to go.

130
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,080
You mean that...

131
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,930
if we make a point to go to HK.

132
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,600
We can go to Volvo Club
and see something.

133
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,330
It's then ideal.

134
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,940
Good.

135
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:58,970
My I right?

136
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,030
Absolutely.

137
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,700
He's right in any way.

138
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,660
Hey, here comes the car.

139
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:38,510
Fat Bull, are you mad?

140
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,040
With such a small car,
how can we take them away?

141
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,510
Yeah, the boss is going to
X'mas party today.

142
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,950
We can take whatever we want.

143
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,080
How can I know,
I'll get a bigger car.

144
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,060
Or we will do a second time.

145
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,550
Shit, start work.

146
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,070
Which is more expensive,
frozen prawn of frozen abalone?

147
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,100
Tat, take whatever you find.

148
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,790
What is it?

149
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,110
It's protected items.

150
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,160
It's mysterious.

151
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,300
Let's see what it is.

152
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,260
No, we'll get shot if we steat it.

153
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,260
Tat, we didn't say to take it away.

154
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,800
Can I just open it and see?

155
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,700
Get something and open it.

156
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,160
It's a big freezer.

157
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,490
I've never seen this before.

158
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,400
What is it?

159
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,530
You idiot!

160
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,560
This is Terracotta.

161
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,940
No, Terracotta is not frozen.

162
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,270
How can it be frozen like this?

163
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,080
May I ask? What exactly is this?

164
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,340
It's body, oh god!

165
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,160
It seems your boss's son
is coming back.

166
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,700
Don't fool me.

167
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,960
He's at the party!

168
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,600
He's so cunning to come back to
check us.

169
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,370
Luckily we are clever,
or we'll be scolded.

170
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,910
You surprised me.

171
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,010
You bastard.

172
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,790
What happened?
Yes.

173
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
There are two possibilities.

174
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,720
First, the bodies
may have been stolen.

175
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,420
Another is.

176
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,630
The bodies changed into...

177
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,090
No that the bodies
have disappeared.

178
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,570
We will be executed,
what shall we do?

179
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,840
Yeah, Tat, use your brain.

180
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,100
I have a way.

181
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,690
It's so horrible here...

182
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,190
Am I in the hell?

183
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,570
How come there're so many monsters?

184
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,920
Why did I lose
all my martial art?

185
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,960
Very cold.

186
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,320
Who is it?

187
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,120
Who?

188
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,800
Boss, are you a new comer?

189
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,030
Queue up if you want.

190
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,670
Queue up.

191
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,900
The social workers have come.

192
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,670
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

193
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,040
Pretend you are hungry.

194
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,510
I am hungry...
I haven't eat for a few day already.

195
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,640
Happy New Year.
I'm hungry.

196
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,150
Good Health.
Thanks.

197
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,880
Have good grades.
Thanks a lot, Social Workers.

198
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,290
Merry Christmas...

199
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,450
This Christmas present is for you.

200
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,320
Thanks.

201
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,150
This is yours.

202
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,690
Excuse me, where am I now?

203
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,970
Kowloon City.

204
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,330
Kowloon City?

205
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,700
Where is Kowloon City?

206
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,500
In Kowloon.
Where is Kowloon?

207
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,540
In Hong Kong.

208
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,040
Where is Hong Kong?

209
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,880
In Asia.

210
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,350
Asia? I don't understand at all.

211
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,620
Then do you know Peking?

212
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,350
Peking, Of course I know.

213
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,050
How long does it
take to walk to Peking?

214
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,950
On foot? Maybe a year.

215
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,220
Is it that when I fainted.

216
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,960
I was smuggled to foreign land?

217
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,100
I think this guy is mad.
You must be careful with you words.

218
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,160
May I know what you are?

219
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,130
I am leader of Royal Guard.

220
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,500
I am an armed guard.

221
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,170
What are you then?

222
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,780
He's head of East Block, a eunuch.

223
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,720
How are you?

224
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,220
He is eunuch?

225
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,650
You are not castrated.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,190
What are you then?

227
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,630
I am the King.

228
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,540
How dare you say you're the King.

229
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,930
I must take you out
and cut off your head.

230
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,270
Wait a minute.

231
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,500
Leader, I am innocent.

232
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,640
This is my paper,
please take it to the King.

233
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,950
What are you doing?

234
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,250
Miss, I know you are straight.
You paid debt for other people.

235
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,050
But what about your debt?

236
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,860
You must pay us the interest first.

237
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,260
Otherwise how can I face my boss?

238
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,660
Don't say any more.

239
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,390
You are insulting my talent.

240
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,430
Anyway, I don't have a dollar now.
You may wipe me off.

241
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,780
Or you must wait after New Year.

242
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,280
Don't say I am too much.

243
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,610
One of my customers
want some excitement.

244
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,920
He wants a girl pretend
to be raped in a car.

245
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,510
Are you crazy?

246
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,960
I am a model,
you think I am a whore?

247
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,220
You are model?
But he will give you $5,000.

248
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,350
No way.

249
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,960
I won't take it as
this is a sexual maniac.

250
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,430
Shit, dare you do it.

251
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,160
Show him some present.

252
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,840
Are you from a circus?

253
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,320
No, no way for that.

254
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,460
Why not? What is this?

255
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,230
Ask him to take off the mask.

256
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,590
Boss, take off the mask.

257
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,940
Lady, come on!

258
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,310
Do you like it?

259
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,680
Shit.

260
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,760
Shit.

261
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,430
Tie up.

262
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,840
Be quick.

263
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,420
You sexual maniac.

264
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,560
You masked rapist.

265
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,600
What are you doing?

266
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,130
You speak foreign language, shit!

267
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,540
Help.

268
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,780
Are you frightened, miss?

269
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,580
Who are you?

270
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,720
They didn't say about you?

271
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,680
Boss...what is it?

272
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,830
What do you want?

273
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,530
Want?

274
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,310
Boss, he's horrible.

275
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,340
Kill him.

276
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,610
Kill him.

277
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,600
Miss, you are safe now.

278
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,840
Where did you come from?
Why are you so busy?

279
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,270
Miss, I have saved your virgin.

280
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,810
Why did you say
such rude remarks?

281
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,170
My colleagues owe someone money.

282
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,910
I am guarantor and
I'm responsible for the debt.

283
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,980
So I must work with that
sexual maniac. Do you understand?

284
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,610
You did it for others?

285
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,880
Miss, you are great.

286
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,550
You are a heroine.

287
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,320
I admire you.

288
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,590
I don't care, you made it a mess.

289
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,060
Tomorrow, you must
talk to their boss, OK?

290
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,760
No problem, I will do it as you say.

291
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,330
I must leave now.

292
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,000
Where's your pager?

293
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,540
Pager?

294
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,610
How can I find you tomorrow?

295
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,540
I have no shelter
as I'm newcomer here.

296
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,610
Your I.D. card?

297
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,020
I.D. card?

298
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,520
You are illegal immigrant?

299
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,820
Bitch, don't be so happy.
I will use acid.

300
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,720
Acid again? Bastard.

301
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,030
Follow me home.

302
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,500
In an hour's time.

303
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,510
You'll be OK, see you.

304
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,440
Come in.

305
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,840
Put you dirty clothes outside.

306
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,650
Or the house will be stink.

307
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,460
Mad.

308
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,580
It's terrific.

309
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,820
What are you doing?

310
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,080
What light is this?

311
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,360
It's light bulb,
where are you from?

312
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,460
I'm from Mi Chi
from Sen Xi Province.

313
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,230
Never heard of.

314
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,100
Where are you from?

315
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,070
Yau Ma Ti.

316
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,200
Yau Ma Ti?

317
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,000
Miss, we've only oil lamp at home.

318
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,580
Ours is by electricity.

319
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,110
Electricity, is it
something like lighting?

320
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,150
Right, a very big dynamite.

321
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,050
It collects all the lighting,

322
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,350
and when we switch on,

323
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,760
then the electricity
will come by the wire,

324
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,200
and light up the bulb, understand?

325
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,720
Understand completely.

326
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,990
You really do?

327
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,140
Men and women
shouldn't get together.

328
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,750
Is your house searched?

329
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,980
I am too busy to tidy it.

330
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,480
I can't imagine a girl's house
can be such a mess.

331
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,980
This is the first time I see one.

332
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,560
How can you such thing to me?

333
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,630
Hello, you've got
the wrong number, bitch!

334
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,970
You are bastard!

335
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,870
What is this?

336
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,100
Don't fool me any more.
You haven't seen a telephone?

337
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,800
Take it and study.

338
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,910
Hello, miss,
your Japanese has come.

339
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,820
Do you need money?
Come if you do.

340
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,450
You've got the wrong number, bitch!

341
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,420
You are bastard.

342
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,460
You learn fast, kid.

343
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,800
You are flattering me.

344
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,970
Miss, what is this?

345
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,770
It's electric kettle, to boil water.

346
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,040
Electric kettle?

347
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,370
What is that small house
we just got in?

348
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,870
It's a lift.

349
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Lift, light, wire.

350
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,880
Electric kettle, telephone...

351
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,860
electric chair.

352
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,790
What are you laughing?

353
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,890
Electric chair for you.

354
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,040
Miss, may I ask...

355
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,620
Hello, dear, how are you?

356
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,690
Miss, how are you?

357
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,400
Dear, come to my place.

358
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,800
Why must I?

359
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,970
I am lonely,
I want you to embrace me.

360
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,780
Shit, men and women
shouldn't get together.

361
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,540
I am a straight gentleman.

362
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,580
I won't be seduced by you.

363
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,980
Get away from me, evil girl.

364
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,950
Where can you run?

365
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,350
No, I'm just joking.

366
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,520
No, be gentle.

367
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,950
Sexual maniac, stop!
Or I will kill you.

368
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,170
Where is he?

369
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,180
Where are the two?

370
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,910
Someone is there,
this is a moving picture.

371
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,140
A moving picture?

372
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,250
A moving picture?
It looks so realistic?

373
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,690
lmmortals in pictures?

374
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,950
What do you mean?
You psychic.

375
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,760
They're acting.
You should have it at your home.

376
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,490
It's like the Chinese opera.

377
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,760
Then it is taken down
by machine.

378
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,530
Then transmit it through
wire to television.

379
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,540
It shows up for us, it's television.

380
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,610
Do you understand?

381
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,410
I do, completely.

382
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,550
You haven't bathed,
you are stink.

383
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,110
Take a bath, go.

384
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,680
Miss, behave yourself.

385
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,650
Behave? Shit.

386
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,060
Take a bath,
wash your ass, toes.

387
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,460
Wash your armpits,
go and wash yourself.

388
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,300
Miss, please leave for the moment.

389
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,080
Do you know how to use the tap?

390
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,750
I know, after checking.

391
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,640
Electric well, I am thirsty.

392
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,820
Water is not good, I'll try again.

393
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,560
It's salty.

394
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,100
I'll wash my face first.

395
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,710
Miss, men and women
shouldn't get together.

396
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,360
Miss, why are you so afraid?

397
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,950
A cockroach.

398
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,430
Is it this one?

399
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,620
Throw it away quick.

400
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,760
It's not bad.

401
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,330
It's more delicious
than the insects at home.

402
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,820
Miss, electric kettle?

403
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,160
He has superhuman powers.

404
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,070
I must sleep now.
Just go on watching.

405
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,430
But don't touch anything.

406
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,250
They're acting the opera
of our Ming dynasty.

407
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,220
He's playing His Majesty?

408
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,890
Mob forced into the palace?
Maybe it's only acting.

409
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,200
Ming Dynasty was over?

410
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,140
Our Ming Dynasty was over?
It must be acting.

411
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,080
It was 1644, more than
300 years from now.

412
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,480
Li Chang forced into Peking,

413
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,990
Sung Ching killed himself.

414
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,790
So I really got in the Wheel.

415
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,920
And was transit to 300 years later.

416
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,790
No.

417
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,590
My country was ruined...

418
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,760
My country was ruined...

419
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,410
Your Majesty...it's my fault.

420
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,740
I couldn't protect your Majesty.

421
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,780
How can I do?

422
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:30,790
I should die.

423
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,730
He got so concentrated
in watching TV.

424
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,760
He's a mad guy.

425
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,560
I'll talk with their boss later.

426
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,160
If I fail, I'll make a sound.

427
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,500
You must go in and 'B' him.

428
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,830
B' him? What does that mean?

429
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,330
This is to 'B' him, idiot!
Do you understand?

430
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,940
Beat him with my fists.

431
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,810
Look at yourself.

432
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,970
How can you negotiate like this?

433
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,550
You must be like me, this way.

434
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,180
How is it?

435
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,120
Be proud, OK?

436
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,760
I understood.

437
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,020
Be smarter.

438
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,630
Light the cigarette for me.

439
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,410
Stupid.

440
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,560
Our boss asks you in.

441
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,300
Put it inside.

442
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,290
What your men
did to me last night.

443
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,100
OK, I can bear it.

444
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,460
But my man can't.

445
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,670
You know people
from China kill easily.

446
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,000
He's good at martial art too.

447
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,700
Master Hung, your had
a lesson last night, right?

448
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,970
I seldom take him out.

449
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,610
But I take him with me today.

450
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,520
I will apologize to you,

451
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,350
and let's forget about yesterday.

452
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,250
Electric toilet bowl.

453
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,570
Ching...

454
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,970
Run.

455
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,120
Fighting.

456
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,890
Good...

457
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,560
Be careful.

458
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,670
I skip, I jump, I tumble.

459
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,670
What is it so powerful?

460
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,340
Are you crazy, it's a gun.

461
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,780
A gun?

462
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,370
I am best at
grasping little weapons.

463
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,250
I'll grasp it.

464
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,650
This is really powerful.

465
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,520
We can't beat him, let's run.

466
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,730
Go...

467
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,800
Jump from here
and it's near, jump...

468
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,060
It's so high, I won't jump...

469
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,040
Jump fast...

470
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,110
No...

471
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,470
No...
Jump.

472
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,170
I won't jump.

473
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,490
Run.

474
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,190
Merry Christmas.

475
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,620
Merry Christmas.

476
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,790
You shit.

477
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,840
Merry Christmas.

478
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,170
So this is your man?

479
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,140
I can't bear.

480
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,710
Sit down.

481
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,210
So stupid.

482
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,020
Miss, what would you like?

483
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,950
Give me a coffee.

484
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,320
And this mister?

485
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,320
Just give him some water.
Sure.

486
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,730
See, watch careful.

487
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,530
This is I.D. card.

488
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,770
Police will kill you without it.

489
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,730
You can't find a job either,
understand?

490
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,190
Miss, you know so many people.

491
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,900
I hope you will get one for me.

492
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,540
And please find me a job too.

493
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,240
This is not a problem.

494
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,000
You must tell me
why you are so stupid.

495
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,540
You are so ignorant.

496
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,210
Where do you come from?

497
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,680
I'm afraid if I say,
you'll touch and caress me again.

498
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,580
I won't...say.

499
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,750
I'm Royal Guard of Ming Dynasty.

500
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,720
I am leader of the Guard.

501
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,990
I got in the Wheel when
I chased my bad colleague.

502
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,260
The Wheel turned
and it's 300 years later.

503
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,490
And I am in Kowloon in HK in Asia.

504
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,800
Forget it then.

505
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,800
What can you do?

506
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:18,500
Though I am an army.

507
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,240
I'm familiar with music,
chess, books and paintings.

508
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,310
I tried hard to learn them.

509
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,240
I'm interested in opening
locks wood work,

510
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:30,250
cement work, fishing,
hunting and folk dances.

511
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,520
I've taken care of myself since young.

512
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,250
So I know a little about washing,
ploughing.

513
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,560
planting, weaving and embroidering.

514
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,430
Moreover, when I was at the army.

515
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,790
I was in charge of food
for 500 soldiers.

516
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,230
It was easy job for me.

517
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,640
It's nothing special.

518
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,100
Men should always do this.

519
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,810
Don't say I'm bad to you.

520
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,440
I'll do you a favour.

521
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,510
You will be my body guard,

522
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,950
a Friday boy and serve me.

523
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,850
I'll give you $300 a month.

524
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,250
You should be happy
as I am good to you.

525
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,420
No, I am a straight man.

526
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,380
How can I serve a woman?

527
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,860
You are a man?

528
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,230
Have you heard: When in Rome,
do as the Romans.

529
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,960
Women are superior here.

530
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,500
Men should
serve women to prove them.

531
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,640
See...look closely.

532
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,600
Dare you woo other girls?

533
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:26,610
Does it hurt?

534
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,840
You asked for that.

535
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,540
Time has changed.

536
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,620
Even the money we are using,

537
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,920
bears a woman on it.

538
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,260
Go away if you must.

539
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,350
No I.D. card, the police
will kill you. I don't care a bit.

540
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,630
Why does this happen to me?

541
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,400
My country was ruined, I can only,

542
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,740
bear all these and find a chance.

543
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,150
Hope I can strengthen
my country one day.

544
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,610
Miss, I promise you.

545
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,810
OK, just learn now.

546
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,220
Put two lumps
in the coffee and stir it.

547
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,230
It's done.
What are you doing?

548
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,560
How can you stir it with your finger?

549
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,040
You...

550
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,200
I spend $300 to hire you.

551
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,670
How can you give that out?

552
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,180
How can you give that out?

553
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,210
Miss, have some tea.

554
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,770
What, I ask you
to serve my colleagues.

555
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,380
Why do you just serve me?
Take it over...

556
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,850
Ass!

557
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,660
I spend $300 to hire you.

558
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:46,780
I'm sorry.

559
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,280
Miss, have some tea.

560
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,860
What is it?

561
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,960
Lemon and mask.

562
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,460
What? You want me to beat you?

563
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:32,230
Country ruined...bear it.

564
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,340
Bear everything, country ruined...
Feng Sau Ching.

565
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,080
Ching, what are you doing?
Faster, I must go to toilet.

566
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,180
I'm washing the clothes.

567
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,940
Why so long?

568
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,340
What are you doing?

569
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,650
You wash the clothes like this?

570
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,000
You make me mad.

571
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,730
Help, my house is finished.

572
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,970
It's on fire, Ching, run quick.

573
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,100
Ching, help.

574
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:14,910
Ching, what are you doing.

575
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,140
I'm cooking something for you.

576
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,210
Shit, why don't you use
microwave oven but burn the log?

577
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,950
My God!

578
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:28,490
Where are there so many flowers?

579
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,790
I plant them, look.

580
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,760
They are lovely, what are they?

581
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,320
African violet.

582
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,310
Are you a man?

583
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,570
I don't know what he's drawing
for the whole day.

584
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,270
You are peasant?

585
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,540
Pay me back.

586
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,670
Pay me back.

587
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,730
We're robbed...

588
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,290
How much is there?

589
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,430
Take the gold watch,
jewels are hard to sell.

590
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,700
Why don't you know anything?

591
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,280
Take it.

592
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,870
Thanks.

593
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,410
I'll take a bath.

594
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,490
Paging 996.

595
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,690
Miss is paging him.

596
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,470
I'll take a bath first.
Coming.

597
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,170
Open the door...

598
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,740
Some is coming, listen...

599
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,180
Open the door.
Why are you so afraid?

600
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:37,810
I know now, it's my husband.

601
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:39,740
Husband?
Open the door.

602
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,650
Ching.

603
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,620
You sexual maniac.
What is it?

604
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,190
Hey...you...l...

605
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,060
Ching, let him off.
Go away.

606
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,170
Don't beat...OK, I'm alright.

607
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,300
I've taught him something,
he won't do that to me again.

608
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,170
Are you really OK?

609
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,400
I am OK.
You must be careful.

610
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,700
OK, go down first, bye.

611
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:09,010
I'm bored,
my husband loves me madly.

612
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,180
When a man madly loves a woman.

613
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,020
It's troublesome, what should I do?

614
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,520
What about this?

615
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,560
Give me $5,000 and I'll send him away.

616
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,340
I've only $3,000, it's not enough.

617
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,940
Maybe it's enough, I'll try.

618
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,780
I'll go first, bye.

619
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,310
What is the work of models?

620
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:50,290
We must sell the clothes to customers.

621
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,850
We must always meet customers.

622
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,020
It's good to have good customers.

623
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,750
But there's bad customers.

624
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:00,520
They want to rape us
when doing business.

625
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,430
I'm scared, thanks your help.

626
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,020
It's good to scare them, right?

627
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,230
It's hard to make money
in Hong Kong.

628
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:09,500
It's good you know.

629
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,240
You bastard,
what do you want to do?

630
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,170
If you damage the TV.

631
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,940
No one will buy a new one,
I warn you.

632
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,560
What so funny to see?

633
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,140
Bastard.

634
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,550
If you let me drink this.

635
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,450
I'll let you lick my toes.

636
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,930
Bastard!

637
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,900
Honey...

638
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,680
He wants to rape me.
Shit.

639
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,770
Bastard, dare you bully my wife?

640
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,820
Bastard.

641
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,260
Husband.

642
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,130
I'll kill you if you don't
take off your hands.

643
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:24,570
If you don't take you,
you'll be a beggar now.

644
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,970
But you are so forgetful.

645
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,640
I helped you many times.

646
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:30,010
You make big money,

647
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,910
but you didn't give me a dollar.

648
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,020
Shut up, what I say is order.

649
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,240
Kneel down and
apologize to my wife.

650
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,090
Aren't you afraid of my gun?

651
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,390
Shit.

652
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,830
Your bullets are here.

653
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,220
These ladies are doing too much.

654
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,190
They take me as a slave.

655
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,160
I promised to serve her only,

656
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,030
I didn't say to serve her friends.

657
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,700
By the way, your man is not bad.

658
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,960
The lease he can
bear your bad temper.

659
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,870
His martial art is so skilled.
He's good at anything.

660
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,770
You must be happy with him.

661
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,440
Shit, you are crazy, what happy?

662
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,780
He's not my man, he's my servant.

663
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,450
As your servant?

664
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:53,080
What about letting me have him?
I'll give you $5,000,

665
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,560
what do you think?
I'll give you $10,000.

666
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,060
I'll give you $15,000.

667
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,530
I won't sell him. I won't sell him
however much you offer.

668
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:00,930
Forget it.
It's your turn.

669
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,360
Right, I want to ask you.

670
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,660
Does he know
he cheated with you?

671
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,900
How can he know?

672
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,060
Don't think he's smart,
he is indeed an idiot!

673
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,710
He can't run away from me.

674
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,970
Does he know what we are?

675
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,580
How will he know as
I am so elegant.

676
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,580
It's hard for you.

677
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,150
Do I look like whore?

678
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,410
You don't look like.

679
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,450
But everyone will know
from your voice.

680
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,850
You are whore?

681
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,080
Whore?

682
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:28,590
Don't shout, we are all whores.

683
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,990
Whore means prostitute.

684
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,800
So, I've been
helping her to cheat.

685
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,980
Oh God! I am a Royal Guard.

686
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,610
But I commit crimes with a whore.

687
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,820
I'm starving, be quick.

688
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,820
No, I won't serve
these whores again.

689
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,930
All I am doing is for the I.D. card?

690
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,970
Country ruined.

691
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,670
It's sad and bad for me.

692
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,780
Why so smart
when the country was ruined?

693
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:42,600
Is it possible I fell in love
with her, no...

694
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,640
I want today's paper.

695
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,750
All limbs are broken.

696
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,790
The murderer does like Feng San.

697
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,660
He's not yet died?

698
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:17,830
He is here? It must be him.

699
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,280
This man is called Feng San.

700
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,980
He is an evil wolf.

701
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,780
He rapes and kill and robs.

702
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,590
Beware of this man.

703
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,770
Please come.

704
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,710
Come on...Polly is a model.

705
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,340
She needs money badly
so she works for this time.

706
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:44,980
Polly.

707
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,160
Hi!

708
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,490
Hi!

709
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,290
Hello, sorry!

710
01:01:58,570 --> 01:01:59,660
Hello, is it Ching?

711
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,030
Ching, I've looking
for you a whole day.

712
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,630
Where have you been?

713
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:06,900
I'll be taking business later.

714
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,280
I'm afraid he will bully me.

715
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,910
Get ready to rescue me.

716
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,120
This woman wants me
to help her cheat again.

717
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,520
I am a Royal Guard,
I won't help her again.

718
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,130
996, right.

719
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,630
Say Miss is paging him,
ask him to find me quick, yes.

720
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,830
I must get the money first.

721
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:41,810
Of course.

722
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,050
Thanks.

723
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,320
Let's have one.

724
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:54,150
I don't take drug.

725
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,320
I'll take one.

726
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,000
Why don't you take a bath first?

727
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,640
No, you bathe first, I'll watch you.

728
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,940
OK, but you must
pay me extra money.

729
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,370
No problem.

730
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,770
Is this enough, take it.

731
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,650
How can I know if it is forget?

732
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,010
I don't know either.

733
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,320
I took it from a man
who cheated me.

734
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,590
I've killed him already.

735
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:39,530
I'm joking, forget the money
for the time being.

736
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,800
You have good muscle.

737
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:47,410
I'm excited, you have a good body.

738
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,270
Do I?
I must take a bath.

739
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:56,650
I am shy.

740
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,520
Why doesn't Ching come?

741
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,430
Your muscle is terrific!

742
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:30,650
I must think it over.

743
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,150
I don't know what I am doing.

744
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,760
Knowing Feng San is alive
but I don't do my duty.

745
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,750
Just for an ignorant woman,

746
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,030
and I forget all my duty.

747
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,230
Feng Sau Ching,
you are seduced by a fox.

748
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,880
No, I must carry out my duty.

749
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,920
You bastard, you are sexual maniac.

750
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,980
My guard will kill you
when he arrives.

751
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,090
You are sexual maniac.

752
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,420
Do you feel comfortable?

753
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,860
No...no.

754
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,170
Your hands are delicate.

755
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,430
No, I am a model, I won't do this!

756
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,740
It hurts, let me go, it kills me.

757
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,680
Miss, is it your?

758
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,440
Why don't you say?

759
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,750
I am not your Miss,
why do you want Miss?

760
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,850
This voice is familiar.

761
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:44,880
Why is it so familiar?

762
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,730
Ching, where are you?

763
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,990
I am in a telephone booth.

764
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:52,870
Don't talk so loudly.

765
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,340
I must say I have
no confidence with you.

766
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,570
I won't let you
make use of me again, bye.

767
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:03,710
Ching, Listen,
someone is trying to kill me.

768
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:06,440
He broke my arm, it hurts.

769
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,080
Someone broke your arm?

770
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:09,380
Yeah.

771
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,480
Who? Who broke your arm?

772
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,420
He looks like Lam.

773
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:18,480
Lam? Who is Lam?

774
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,220
Ching.

775
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,670
Hello...Lam? Who is Lam?

776
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,860
Hello...Lam? Who is Lam?

777
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,840
Excuse me, who is Lam?

778
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,240
Lam? This is Lam?

779
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,240
Don't you know Lam?
He must be illegal immigrant.

780
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,740
Mad.

781
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,180
Feng San, Lam is Feng San.

782
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,310
Feng San...

783
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:45,880
Miss.

784
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,160
Stupid dog.
Feng San.

785
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,630
Come to
Happy Valley Cemetery at once.

786
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,790
Don't act rashly.

787
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:01,700
Where?

788
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,530
The second gate.

789
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:12,250
Hey, where are you?
Dare you jump in?

790
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,730
Feng San, say, where are you?

791
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:35,960
Go to hell at once.

792
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,520
Stupid dog,
how are you these 3 centuries?

793
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:54,580
Feng San.

794
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,480
Ching.
Miss.

795
01:07:58,530 --> 01:07:59,620
Don't come...

796
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,260
or I'll break her head.

797
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,220
You threaten me
with a common woman.

798
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,200
Don't you fear
others laugh at you?

799
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,270
What? At this world?

800
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,500
Make it clear,
you old-fashioned man.

801
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,240
Sung Ching is dead for a long time.

802
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,040
Ming Dynasty was ruined centuries ago.

803
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,340
Why are you still after me?

804
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:23,040
Why did you put
my pictures in the street?

805
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,650
This is my duty.

806
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,020
I was ordered to capture
and take you back.

807
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:29,190
I won't change

808
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:30,690
however the time changes.

809
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,060
I feel sick whenever I see you.

810
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,830
I must teach you something.

811
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,200
I'll kill your woman in front of you.

812
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,640
Stop, or I'll bite her throat.

813
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,940
I beg you,

814
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,880
I am not my woman.
I am her common friend.

815
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:55,050
Common friend?

816
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,340
Yeah.

817
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:58,980
Then you can enjoy
and watch my performance.

818
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,060
Wait, this is only a dispute
between you and me.

819
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,360
There's nothing to do with her,
let her go.

820
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:11,160
I am begging you.

821
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,770
OK, I am begging you.

822
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,370
I fear you, OK.

823
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:25,080
Why will you say this and beg me?

824
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:27,750
Just give me a reason.

825
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:30,080
I may release her.

826
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,720
I am impatient.

827
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,480
I will count one, two, three.

828
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,290
I love her, I fell in love with her.

829
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,970
How can you say these dirty words?

830
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,470
But, a man like you.

831
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,780
How will you with
such a dirty woman?

832
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,710
OK, prove it to me.

833
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,310
OK, what do you want me do to?

834
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,350
Drink this.

835
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,760
martial Art Ruining Lotion.

836
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:17,070
Think it over, drink it and
you will lose your martial art.

837
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,460
Don't ask me why

838
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:28,000
Because I don't want you
to shadow me.

839
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,740
Ching, don't drink it.
He eats words.

840
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:49,760
Ching.

841
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,900
Hero always loves beauty.

842
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,530
Don't try to be a hero.

843
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,770
But you are not a hero, you are ass.

844
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:10,120
You ruin your martial art
for a woman?

845
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,420
You forget the duty
from his Majesty!

846
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:16,720
I look down on you.

847
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,050
Don't let me see your again.

848
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,560
Otherwise I will kill you, go.

849
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:24,130
Colleague.

850
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,130
Don't call me colleague.

851
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,140
I know you will eat words.

852
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,540
Why you drank it then?

853
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,080
I have no chance if I didn't drink it.

854
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:38,850
Now I have a bit chance
after drinking it.

855
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,510
Because of this bit chance,

856
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,520
so I did all this.

857
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,750
Feng San, we've been colleague
for so many years.

858
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,490
You should understand me.

859
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:58,320
I'd rather die than being insulted.

860
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:04,670
Besides my parents,

861
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,170
his Majesty and instructor.

862
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,610
I never kneel to anybody.

863
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:26,790
But now I kneel to you
and beg you to release her.

864
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,370
Look at you.

865
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,080
You spoil my interest
in playing your woman.

866
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:46,680
Don't let me see you two again.

867
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,380
Or I will kill your both.

868
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,280
Ching, are you OK, Ching?

869
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,330
Miss, tie up the arm.

870
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,800
Be good from now on.

871
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,760
I must go now.

872
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,400
Ching, don't go, Ching.

873
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,740
Ching, what are you trying to do?

874
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:29,580
Ching, where are you going?

875
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,660
Ching, come back.

876
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:55,440
My horse, someone
robbed my horse, stop?

877
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,210
Ching, you must
go to hospital at once.

878
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,950
Ching...

879
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:32,880
You stupid dog, why did you seal,
your pulse with the gold pins?

880
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,620
If you must fight with me now.

881
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:35,880
With 4 hours.

882
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:38,590
You will be bleeding and die.

883
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:46,130
Tell me, why did you do that?

884
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,230
I can only seal
my pulse with gold pins,

885
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,340
to preserve my
martial art for one hour.

886
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:53,270
I must die with you.

887
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,070
Come on...

888
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,050
Shit.

889
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:32,340
Come on, professor, keep up...run.

890
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,220
Stupid dog...come on...

891
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,150
Stupid dog, come on...

892
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,630
Come on, keep up...

893
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:58,570
Feng San, didn't you say
you understand me?

894
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,770
You should know in order to
carry out his Majesty's,

895
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,170
in order to
rescue my beloved woman.

896
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,670
I will sacrifice myself.

897
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,680
Right, you are great, stupid dog.

898
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,380
It's bad, there is a car up there?

899
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,520
Don't move, just let him die.

900
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:18,590
Feng San, I must die with you.

901
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,250
You'd better die before me.

902
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,530
Stupid dog, come and
take me back to the King.

903
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:41,100
Shit.

904
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:44,240
Stupid dog...

905
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,320
Where are you?

906
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,260
Stupid dog, come and catch me.

907
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,430
Quick...

908
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:41,970
Follow me.

909
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:43,300
That way...

910
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:03,480
Faster, follow me everybody.

911
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:05,990
Ching, don't scare me, Ching.

912
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,730
Give him first aids.
Be quick.

913
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,300
The poison is in effect,
I'm dying.

914
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,030
Miss, farewell.

915
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:19,070
Ching, your must survive.

916
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:22,300
Miss, I am asking you
the eighth time.

917
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,640
Give me something new.

918
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:24,800
Who is he?

919
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,480
You'll get the same answer from me.
Same answer from me!

920
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:29,640
He's my man,
a Royal Guard form Ming Dynasty.

921
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,710
Shit, you fool me?

922
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:33,490
I'll sue you.

923
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,790
I tell you, if you can prove him
to be from Ming Dynasty.

924
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,260
I will lick your toes.

925
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,790
Doctor, how his Feng Sau Ching?

926
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,390
He was poisoned severly.

927
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,630
Fortunately the sea water
and we saved him.

928
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,790
I always say
Hong Kong's doctors are capable.

929
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:50,700
But there is something strange.

930
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,040
I've tested his cell.

931
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,270
It shows that he is over 300 years old.

932
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:56,800
He is from Ming Dynasty then?

933
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,110
Is the machine out of order?

934
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,950
How is it? Are you licking my toes?

935
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,750
Why did you beat her?

936
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,250
Miss, do you want to sue him?
I'll be witness.

937
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,830
I only want to see Feng Sau Ching.

938
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:15,730
He is unconscious. You can only
see him tomorrow noon.

939
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:18,230
And you must get permission
from the police.

940
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,040
Basically no.

941
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:26,070
But we police are nice people.

942
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,570
So I'll grant you this time.

943
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,580
Sir.

944
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:36,720
Sir, how is it?

945
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,710
Your man doesn't
want to see you, go away.

946
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,190
You fool me?

947
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,520
What if I do?

948
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,590
It hurts, take your hands off me.

949
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,370
OK, be quick.

950
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,060
Ching.

951
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:07,270
Ching, didn't you tell the police
you wouldn't see me?

952
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,350
Don't pretend sleeping, I know.

953
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,660
I don't want to see you, go away.

954
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:19,360
Are you crazy?

955
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,890
You become idiot after drinking
the potion? I am your miss.

956
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:27,070
You cheat me and make use of me.

957
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:31,400
You seem a model
but in fact you're a whore.

958
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,770
You are prostitute,

959
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,240
women like you,
will be beheaded in Ming Dynasty.

960
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,550
Beheaded you!

961
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,380
OK, I'll be responsible for what I did.

962
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:48,080
I confess, it's all my fault.

963
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:51,080
I am apologizing to you now.

964
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,960
Don't be like this,
I'll say you are my man now.

965
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,490
I'll be very good to you.

966
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,830
But I won't say you are my woman.

967
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,730
But you say you love me...

968
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:09,440
If I don't love you,
I wouldn't die for you.

969
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,180
But love is love, dying is dying.

970
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,280
I won't get on
with a woman like you.

971
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,220
I have my principles.

972
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,260
Don't you so smart, you!

973
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:26,280
I am nearly begging you.

974
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:29,730
What do you want?
I'll improve myself.

975
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,100
But men will never change.

976
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,840
Men will remain the same.

977
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,940
I am still a Royal Guard for 300 years.

978
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,840
Feng San is still a woman killer.

979
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,770
I cant help...

980
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:48,140
Ioving a bad woman.

981
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,510
But I can stop myself from seeing her.

982
01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:00,990
Go away, I'm tired, I need rest.

983
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,300
OK, forget it.

984
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,860
You are so hard heartened, go.

985
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:09,460
Go away.

986
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:24,380
Aunt.

987
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:25,890
It's you.
I surprised you.

988
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,480
Does he know I made it?

989
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,260
No, I do as you tell me.

990
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:35,130
I said he looks like my late son.

991
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,200
So I make soup for him everyday.

992
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,960
Please take this.
I can't.

993
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:41,470
Take it.

994
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,630
Thanks.

995
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,640
I'll come tomorrow,
I'm leaving now, bye.

996
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:51,870
You dropped it everywhere.

997
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,570
I'll help you pick it up.

998
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,240
You step on my things.

999
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:00,550
Forget it, aunt.

1000
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,020
Are you blind?

1001
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,320
I am sorry.

1002
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:15,330
What do you want?
I'll improve myself.

1003
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:17,200
Miss, I want to give you back
the thermos flask.

1004
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,840
Don't know if it's broken.

1005
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,170
It's OK.

1006
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,570
Take it.

1007
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:28,180
Why are you giving so much money?

1008
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,580
It's OK, I want you to do me favour.

1009
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:31,850
What is it?

1010
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:42,430
Thanks, I'll soon be back.

1011
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,800
Don't make a sound,
Feng San is trying to catch you.

1012
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,670
Why are you covering
your head? It's unlucky.

1013
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,550
Shit! I saw nothing.

1014
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,620
The exhibition of Buddha.
The Wheel is displayed the first time,

1015
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,030
will be on show in HK in 3 months.

1016
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:46,690
Now what you see,

1017
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,690
is the Wheel
with a history of 500 years.

1018
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:14,350
Master San, here are six cartons,

1019
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,560
it's $488000, please pay now.

1020
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,590
Why? You want to start
a war with these weapons?

1021
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,700
If you want to do
a big robbery count us in.

1022
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:31,360
Shit.

1023
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:34,400
I will forever be looked down here.

1024
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:39,010
It's not my land
I can't beat people in HK.

1025
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,550
Shit, what's the use of martial art?

1026
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:48,390
I must get these weapons
back to Ming Dynasty

1027
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,680
and wipe out the palace.

1028
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:53,660
I must kill the king
and I'll be King then.

1029
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,140
Your history will be altered.

1030
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,930
Master San, I don't understand
what you are saying.

1031
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,440
Me either.

1032
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:10,870
It's better that you don't understand.

1033
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,110
We've stole some national
precious again. What good is there?

1034
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:19,450
Yes, an ancient sword, I'll show you.

1035
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,560
There's no rust after centuries.

1036
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,890
It's Lun Chuen Sword.

1037
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,430
Someone offered $180000 for it.

1038
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:38,460
Shit, it's Feng Sau Ching's
Lun Chuen Sword.

1039
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,270
No wonder my sword
was broken by him.

1040
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,710
This sword worth ten million,
I'll take it.

1041
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,710
OK, I'll sell it to you
if you give me one million.

1042
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:53,120
You don't deserve to own it.

1043
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,920
You don't know about it at all.

1044
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:59,230
I'll show you.

1045
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:08,560
It's a good sword,
it doesn't take up a dip of blood.

1046
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:29,280
Ming Dynasty will be mine...

1047
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,400
It's incredible.

1048
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:42,370
The Wheel will be in HK.

1049
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:44,470
Is this fate?

1050
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,640
In 2 months and 17 days at midnight.

1051
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:51,010
It's the miracle day.

1052
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,010
The Wheel will perform great power.

1053
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:57,840
Feng San will show up then.

1054
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,420
It's time I carried out my duty.

1055
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,650
Can you beat him?

1056
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,560
No.

1057
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:06,020
No? Why must you then?

1058
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,090
Can't you stop being so stubborn?

1059
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:12,370
No, I've promised his Majesty.
I must take Feng San back.

1060
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,100
I'll be dishonest if I don't try.

1061
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:19,370
I'll die will him if I can't beat him.

1062
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:21,200
If I beat him.

1063
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,840
I'll take him to the Wheel
and back to see his Majesty.

1064
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:27,880
Then you're leaving...

1065
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:31,650
and not coming back?

1066
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,120
I don't belong here anyway.

1067
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:37,380
What about me?

1068
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:39,820
You'd better leave now.

1069
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,600
Are you crazy?

1070
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:44,560
You say you love me.

1071
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,330
Love is love.

1072
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,800
I must practice
within these two months.

1073
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:52,900
I must refine a sword
to fight with Feng San.

1074
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,070
I can't concentrate if you are here.

1075
01:29:57,250 --> 01:30:00,740
It hurt anyway, as Chuen says.

1076
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,920
If love can't be forever,
it's good to have it once.

1077
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:10,720
I don't care, I'll never leave here.

1078
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,160
OK, if you insist.

1079
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,550
But you must prove
you can improve yourself.

1080
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:18,630
How to?

1081
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,490
It depends on you.

1082
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:23,660
We'll see.

1083
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,480
Eat it, until I die.

1084
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,110
Beware of the thunders.

1085
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:39,720
You're lucky to have me feeding you.

1086
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:53,320
It's tasty.

1087
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,500
Your Majesty, I've refined a sword.

1088
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,530
I must beat Feng San.

1089
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:44,080
Hope Your Majesty bless me to win.

1090
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,220
Ching, I'll give you
this bullet-proof coat.

1091
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:24,680
This is your sword.

1092
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,250
The Miss Sword...

1093
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,360
Is that me? What happens?

1094
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,800
I forget something, wait for me.

1095
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:13,630
Ching...

1096
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:43,520
What are you doing?

1097
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,190
The exhibition is closed?
Where do you want to go?

1098
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:41,510
Feng San, go to the rood for a duet

1099
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,650
if you want to
get the Black Jade Buddha.

1100
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,250
Stupid dog!

1101
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:22,230
Feng San, you have done
so many evil deeds,

1102
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,700
follow me to Ming Dynasty,

1103
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,600
I'll beg his Majesty to spare you.

1104
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,790
I must blow you up.

1105
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:40,980
Ching...

1106
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:33,770
Ching...

1107
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:10,140
Bitch, pay the money quickly.

1108
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:14,010
No? Then why are you a Miss?

1109
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:18,310
I am no more a Miss,
I word in a shop now.

1110
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:20,650
How can I have money?

1111
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:24,280
I have only $200 with you,
you may take it.

1112
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:25,890
Take it all.

1113
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:27,050
Dare your act!

1114
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:36,930
This is water.

1115
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:52,180
Ching...

1116
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,950
You are alive? You didn't die?

1117
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:02,890
Miss is sexually assaulting me!
