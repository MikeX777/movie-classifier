1
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,041
Another hot one outside today

2
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,668
as this heat wave continues.

3
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,211
Record highs today and all week

4
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,171
so let's keep you cool
on this morning commute

5
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,382
with cool new music
just released.

6
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,800
It's hot new music

7
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,261
on a very hot day
on Hot 99.7.

8
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,460
Good morning,
Mr. Wigglesworth.

9
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,171
Num, num, num,
num, num, num, num.

10
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,259
Uh, morning, Kara.

11
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,636
In a rush?

12
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,514
Yeah, well, you know,
life is short.

13
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:10,100
Really, really short.

14
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,477
You never know,

15
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,522
you might just not
wake up tomorrow.

16
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,232
Welp, gotta get to kendo class.

17
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,275
Kara, wait.

18
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,694
You forgot your,
um, sword thing.

19
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,779
Thanks, Dameon.

20
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,864
Goodbye forever.

21
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,033
JK.

22
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,913
She is such a spazoid.

23
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,414
Can you pick a victor
or something.

24
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,250
You can totally do that, right?

25
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,793
She's not that bad.

26
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,336
Try sharing a bathroom with her.

27
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,171
I'm gonna walk in
on her one of these days

28
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,756
and find her slitting
her wrists or something.

29
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,424
Ew.

30
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,093
Yeah, well, at least
if she's got some blood on her,

31
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,178
she'd be wearing some color.

32
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,473
Yo, Lar-Dawg,
where my pop-tart at?

33
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,600
Catch.

34
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,186
Dawg, you burned it.

35
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,563
No, man.

36
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,481
I heard you get
more protein this way.

37
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,900
Nice.

38
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,985
Morning, boys.

39
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,570
Got anything in there for me?

40
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,447
Well, Trish,
you can have my pop-tart.

41
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,824
Uh, thanks, G.

42
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,576
But how about you
and Lar-Dawg just bring me

43
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,578
an orange sherbet
mochaccino later?

44
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,870
Sure thing, Trish.

45
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,706
Where you gonna be?

46
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,998
Around campus.

47
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,500
I'm gonna be working
on my econ paper.

48
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,503
Ow.
I don't know nothing about econ.

49
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,131
See you later, boys.

50
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,346
I hate to see you go.

51
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,432
But I love to watch you leave.

52
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,225
Pffew!

53
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,311
Yeah.

54
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,314
Come on, guys.

55
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,691
You're gonna
get played like that?

56
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,693
Shut up. We're gonna
get laid like that,

57
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,778
while you lie in your bed
all alone

58
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,325
listening to the bumps
through the ceiling.

59
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,868
Sorry.

60
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,787
Just made me throw up
in my mouth for a second.

61
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,539
Don't cross swords.

62
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,000
Yo, shut your face.

63
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,544
Lameon.

64
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,796
Come on, guys, think about it.

65
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,139
You guys live downstairs,
remember?

66
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,808
Yeah, but the games
are up here, dingbat.

67
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,186
Aye, at last ye land lover.

68
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,562
Luke!

69
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,731
You're wearing a tunic.

70
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,608
Knights wear tunics.

71
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,859
Yar.

72
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,654
So why are you talking
like a pirate?

73
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,738
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

74
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,989
Come down to my car.

75
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,491
I have something awesome
to show you.

76
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,159
Hold on a second.
I want to get changed.

77
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,078
At least one of us
should look normal.

78
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,961
Happy birthday, man.

79
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,714
Whoa, man.
These are awesome.

80
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,841
What do we use 'em for?

81
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,426
What won't we use 'em for?

82
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,428
Plus, I think they'd be great
to have in the show.

83
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,013
Yeah, good idea.

84
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,349
Well, and one of 'em's mine.

85
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,059
Yeah, of course.

86
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,061
Yes.

87
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,187
Hope anyone didn't see us.

88
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,647
Maybe we should put these away.

89
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,607
Hey, wait, wait.

90
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,942
Check this out.

91
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,069
What?

92
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,072
What is this?

93
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,824
And where do you get these?

94
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,617
At a tag sale.

95
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,120
They had this there too.

96
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,205
Whoa.

97
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,125
This is so cool.

98
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,126
I know, right?

99
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,544
Let's put these away

100
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,796
before the tenants
think we're on a crusade.

101
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,049
Speaking of which,
Kara is an angel.

102
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,843
Yeah, she's
a good tenant and all

103
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,096
but she can be
kind of weird sometimes.

104
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,806
Well, you do remember
what happened

105
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,516
to her brother, Tommy, right?

106
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,865
Yeah.

107
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,285
Watching your only brother be
impaled by a mailbox,

108
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,706
it just creates
a lot of baggage.

109
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,876
Well, she's still
kind of cute, though.

110
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,379
What part of "crazy"
don't you understand?

111
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,424
Mmm.. Pretty much all of it.

112
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,635
Anyways, can we get on
with the show?

113
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,932
Hello, everyone.

114
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,684
Okay, three, two.

115
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,394
Hello, everyone,

116
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,898
and welcome to another adventure
in "This Week in Geek."

117
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,067
And we're your hosts,
Luke the Duke.

118
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,569
And I'm DK.

119
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,696
Last week,
we discussed the concept

120
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,406
for our next comic book.

121
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,742
And it's totally
gonna be space zombies.

122
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,951
Wait, well, hold on a second.

123
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,161
Wait.

124
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,246
We're not gonna do
zombies anymore?

125
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,915
Well, no, hear me out.

126
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,333
I know what this is.

127
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,752
You hate zombies, don't you?

128
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,755
Yeah, I mean, they kind of
drive me insane but...

129
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,923
I'm pretty sure you need to

130
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,508
hand over
your geek card right now.

131
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,511
All they ever do
is mope around and moan at you.

132
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,304
What kind of geek are you?

133
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,973
One that hates zombies,
apparently.

134
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,475
What's next?

135
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,270
Are you gonna tell me
that Greedo shot first?

136
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,946
You fought well.
Now, die with honor.

137
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,281
Ow!
Ow.

138
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:01,076
As honorable as you think.

139
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,287
Wow, you guys are idiots.

140
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,747
Oh, uh, hey, guys.

141
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,040
Dude, come on.

142
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,001
That was straight-up bullshit.

143
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,378
There's no way in hell
he made that pass.

144
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,964
Well, maybe you should
stop sucking.

145
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,218
Maybe you should stop
sucking your mother's dong.

146
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,388
Hey, man.

147
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,391
No, ow, ow.

148
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,269
Please don't procreate.

149
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,357
Guys, you gonna pay rent
this month or what?

150
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,734
Who do you think you are,
the landlord?

151
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,943
No.

152
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,403
Then shut up.

153
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,739
Hey, Dameon, I'll have it to you
by tomorrow.

154
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,741
I've got to pick up
some product.

155
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,117
What?

156
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,703
Still selling pills
to 16-year-old kids?

157
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,004
Yo, what up?

158
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:54,839
Yeah, yo, what up?

159
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,298
You got some ecs?

160
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,507
Where you going to,
like, a rave or something

161
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,550
with your Mickey Mouse gloves.

162
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,594
You know it, dog.

163
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,055
Yeah, girl, we can hook you up.

164
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,056
$20 a pill.

165
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,307
Give me two.

166
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,435
Just be aware,
ecs is a gateway drug...

167
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,853
...to getting laid.

168
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,980
Yeah.

169
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,818
Oh, easy money.

170
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,696
Yeah, these kids are so dumb,
they can't tell the difference

171
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,616
between ecstasy
and baby aspirin, man.

172
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,618
We're keeping these kids
off drugs.

173
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,747
Yo, it's like we're
the anti-drug superhero.

174
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,458
This is some straight-up
Robin Hood shit, man.

175
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,169
Uh, hey, uh, this came for you.

176
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,671
Happy birthday.

177
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,757
It's not from us.

178
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,093
Yeah, Lar-Dawg,
let's ditch these losers

179
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,261
and go get Trish
that frappe what's-it.

180
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,347
Yeah.

181
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,478
Man, forget about those
douche bags.

182
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,855
What's in the package?

183
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,700
"Dearest Dameon.

184
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,620
If you are reading this,
then it is your 25th birthday.

185
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,122
Happy birthday.

186
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:14,668
It also means
that we are all dead.

187
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,086
Sad.

188
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,713
You must work extra hard now

189
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:22,009
because of the secret
responsibility that you inherit.

190
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,137
This key is for the trunk
in the basement.

191
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,097
Make us proud.

192
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:31,143
Love, Mum, Dad and Albert."

193
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,979
Dude, didn't your family die

194
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,524
in a series of completely
unrelated freak accidents?

195
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,110
How'd they all know they died?

196
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,030
Dude,
will you shut up for a minute?

197
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,204
Well, here's the key.

198
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,207
You wanna go open up the trunk?

199
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,170
Oh, man.
It smells like ass.

200
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,839
When was the last time
you came down here?

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,176
Not since I inherited the place.

202
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,306
Hey, over there.

203
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,317
So, you want to open it?

204
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,740
Is that it?

205
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,824
Lame.

206
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,577
It looks like 16th century.

207
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,871
That is so cool you know that.

208
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,372
Can I touch it?

209
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,749
Yeah, it is kind of cool.

210
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,793
Hey, be careful.

211
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,170
It's, like,
really old and stuff.

212
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,713
Are you gonna
whip it out or what?

213
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,008
That's what she said.

214
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,301
Pffew!

215
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,887
No, not yet.

216
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,598
This is, like, a lot of stuff
to deal with right now.

217
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,850
I need to figure out
what it all means.

218
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,310
Maybe there's an explanation

219
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,647
in that scrolly-looking
book thingy.

220
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,734
What's it say?

221
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,654
I don't know.
I can't understand Japanese.

222
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,572
I do.

223
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,989
- Really?
- You do?

224
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,034
I'm taking
the fourth year advanced class

225
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,702
but it's not like I ever use it.

226
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,579
Yeah, right, you spend all day

227
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,207
watching those weird-ass
googly-eyed cartoons.

228
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,626
Yo, I didn't know
girls could be nerds too.

229
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,710
Hey!

230
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,045
She can still get it.

231
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,755
Watch it, ass-wipe.

232
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,173
I'm just saying.

233
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,092
I kind of dig that vampire shit.

234
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,386
Bet she's a freak
in the bed, y'all.

235
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,555
My throat ain't
the only thing she can suck.

236
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,306
Ugh, what the frack, guys.

237
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,183
Yeah, shut the frack up.

238
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,768
Did you just say "frack"?

239
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,689
I wouldn't touch you
with a 10-foot buster sword.

240
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,899
Bust-your-nut sword.

241
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,485
Real classy, guys.

242
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,655
Aw, come on.

243
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,242
You know you want a piece
of the Lar-Dawg, baby.

244
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,162
I told you to shut up, Larry.

245
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,955
Oh, what you gonna do
about it, little man?

246
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,039
I'll think of something.

247
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,082
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,251
Hey, just chill out, guys.

249
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,419
Yo, dawg, he ain't worth it.

250
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,004
Let's go shot gun some beers.

251
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,797
Sounds good, bro.

252
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,216
Wouldn't want this dork to get
any of his dork blood on me.

253
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,802
I'd be infected.

254
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,936
Kara, are you okay?

255
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,646
Can I, like,
come in or something?

256
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,107
Yeah, it's open.

257
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,447
Hey.

258
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,906
Don't let them get to you.

259
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,824
What makes them think
they can talk to me

260
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,784
like I'm some kind of sl...

261
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,161
I know.
They're meatheads.

262
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,788
Just don't let them bother you.

263
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,584
So why do you hang out
with them anyway?

264
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,003
Like, I don't know,
they're fun and predictable

265
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,838
and, when it comes down to it,
they're harmless.

266
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,089
They're all talk.

267
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,717
Yeah, but they
completely objectify you

268
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,969
and say gross things.

269
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,847
I mean, doesn't it make you
want to cut their tongue out

270
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,599
with a rusty steak-knife?

271
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,392
Ew, no.

272
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,686
Look, there's nothing wrong
with embracing your sexuality.

273
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,313
It's empowering.

274
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,148
Well, guess that works out
for you.

275
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,691
It does.

276
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,861
So why are you being
so nice to me?

277
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,279
Well, most of the time,

278
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,031
I don't know why
you're always freaking out

279
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,493
but this time I did.

280
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,874
Hey, guys.
Is, um, everything okay?

281
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,168
Yeah.

282
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,754
You're actually really pretty.

283
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:32,133
When your face isn't
covered in that crap.

284
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,219
Let's just agree to disagree.

285
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,888
Mmm.

286
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:42,394
So what do you think that is?
Samurai skills for dummies?

287
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:47,524
More like the truth
behind my family's death.

288
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,359
I'm sorry, I'm such an asshole.

289
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,904
Here, I'll do it tonight.

290
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,592
Tommy, I wish you could be here.

291
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,555
This is, like, for real
feudal Japanese stuff.

292
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:29,107
Wait a minute.

293
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,318
Holy crap!

294
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,804
Aghh!

295
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,608
Ahh

296
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,260
What the hell was that?

297
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,635
Aghh!

298
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,376
Hey, Kara?

299
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,878
Is everything okay in there?

300
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,254
I couldn't help but notice

301
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,716
the extreme fear
and panic in your eyes.

302
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,557
Kara?

303
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,752
Yo, it's open.

304
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,422
Didn't Kara just get home?

305
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,091
Uh yeah, so?

306
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,635
Isn't everybody home already?

307
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,596
How the hell am I
supposed to know all that?

308
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,240
Yo, it sounds like somebody's
getting it on right now.

309
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,576
As if anybody gets laid
in this house besides us.

310
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,702
Pfft.

311
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,078
Yo, what the F?

312
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,038
I said, "Blitz."
You know what a blitz is, right?

313
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,874
Yeah, yeah, I know what...

314
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,919
Oh, G.
G.

315
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,925
Those boys are like children.
All four of them.

316
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,480
Who the hell is that?

317
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,321
Yeah, die, you son of a bitch.

318
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,283
I can't believe
that bastard bit me.

319
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,659
Ugh, man.

320
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,955
Dude, what the hell?
Who is this guy?

321
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,171
I don't know.

322
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,507
He just flew in here
and jumped at G.

323
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,093
Yeah, he bit me like
some type of crackhead.

324
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,012
Dude, what...?

325
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,640
It was right here.
What do you expect me to do?

326
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:44,185
Man, I hope he didn't
give me rabies or something.

327
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,978
Aghh! That's hot.

328
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,023
Hey! Be careful.

329
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,317
This is like a...

330
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,280
- You okay, man?
- Did you hear that?

331
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,990
- Hear what?
- You didn't hear it?

332
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,623
That's the last time
I buy anything online.

333
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,960
- That's my...
- Kara, do you know him?

334
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,255
Who killed my brother, again?

335
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,841
That piece of shit's
your brother?

336
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,219
Get outta my way.

337
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,847
Kara!

338
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,020
What was that?

339
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,106
Trish.

340
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,861
No, no.

341
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,325
Who are you?

342
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:49,125
Trish!

343
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,209
You've got to be kidding.

344
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,335
Did you see that?

345
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,420
A zombie?

346
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,922
That's not a zombie.

347
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,009
That's a ninja zombie.

348
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,719
Trish!

349
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,513
Ow!

350
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,943
What the frack, dude?

351
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,487
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

352
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,531
I don't know.

353
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:07,286
You guys, seriously, what the F.

354
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,788
Zombies?

355
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,748
Where do you think
they all came from?

356
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,041
A virus?

357
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,459
Meteorite?

358
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,169
Some sort of chemical?

359
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,421
Dameon, listen to me.

360
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,631
You hold my sword.

361
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,008
Did you find my spirit?

362
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,218
Uh,

363
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,386
What was that?

364
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,263
Nothing.
Never mind.

365
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,266
Hey, Trish, you okay?

366
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,060
No.

367
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,770
Look at my room.

368
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,480
The Hell Sword has been released.

369
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,773
You have to find me.

370
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,900
What was that?
You guys hear that?

371
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,277
- Huh?
- What?

372
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,324
What?

373
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,618
Where am I?

374
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,161
Who are you?

375
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:53,416
I'm your ancestor,
Akechi Tenshu.

376
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,377
But how do you know English?

377
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,463
I'm not speaking English,
you son of a discount Kage.

378
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,925
Your mind is hearing
me in English.

379
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,053
Okay, Gramps.
Say I believe you.

380
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,764
Can you tell me
what the hell is going on?

381
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,516
I'll show you.

382
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,268
It all began
when I stole the Hell Sword

383
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,936
from Oda Nobunaga.

384
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,563
Since then,
it's been our family's mission

385
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,440
to safeguard the secret
of the Hell Sword

386
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,650
from those ninja
who still seek it.

387
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,652
Each generation,
the eldest child is trained

388
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,655
to take over this responsibility
at age 25.

389
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,868
Your brother died before
he ever reached that age.

390
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,965
The Kage ninja hunted him down

391
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,177
as they have done
to so many of our kin.

392
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,142
The ninjas wasted no time
in attacking your parents next.

393
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,452
Your parents fought with honor.

394
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,705
No!

395
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,874
The ninjas did not.

396
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:25,109
Now the even greater
responsibility falls upon you.

397
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,319
The sword has been reawakened.

398
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,822
You have to seal it away.

399
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,575
But why didn't they tell me?

400
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,994
Your brother was supposed to
inherit this duty.

401
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,997
They hoped you'd never
have to bear this burden.

402
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,249
But how am I supposed to...

403
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,459
Use my sword.

404
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,504
I was 25 when I channeled
my soul into it.

405
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,341
Now that you're the same age,
you can fight with my skill

406
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,177
but only with this sword.

407
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,181
The Hell Sword
brings the dead back

408
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,308
until you train the impules.

409
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,561
To complete their life's
last mission...

410
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,525
and to devour living flesh.

411
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,448
Though the Kage Ninja
have all been killed,

412
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,659
the Jigoku no Ken
has brought them back.

413
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,119
They do not feel pain.

414
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,662
They do not tire

415
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,372
and they will not stop
hunting the sword

416
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,168
until they bring their master
Nobunaga back to life.

417
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,547
You can't dump this all on me

418
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,965
and expect me
to take care of it.

419
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,300
You have to.

420
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:34,261
If you don't,
life as you know it

421
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,639
will come to an end.

422
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,233
Dameon.
Hey, Dameon.

423
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,735
I'm awake, I'm awake.
Stop shaking me.

424
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,780
Sorry, man.
You gave us a scare back there.

425
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,574
I just got lightheaded
for a little bit.

426
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,867
Yeah.

427
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,244
Let me help you up.

428
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,287
C'mon.

429
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,503
What happened?

430
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,088
Is everyone okay?

431
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:13,467
Well, Kara, she hasn't
really said anything.

432
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:17,554
And Trish, well,
she's pretty shaken up.

433
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,431
Her shoulder...

434
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,268
Would you look at my vest.

435
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,812
Ah, right.

436
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,231
Where's Tommy's body?

437
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,109
I tossed that shit
out the window.

438
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,404
Hey, man, we need to
figure out what to do here.

439
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,780
If these things are zombies...

440
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,824
Yo.

441
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,243
If these things are zombies,

442
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,539
does that mean
that G.'s infected?

443
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,084
I don't know if it's contagious

444
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,380
but everything we need to know
should be in the journal.

445
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,968
It holds the secret behind
this mystical legendary sword.

446
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,139
It's called the
"Jigoku no Ken."

447
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,644
Aghhh!

448
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,772
Okay.

449
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,692
I think the coast is clear.

450
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,194
The sword's under the bed.

451
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,363
Oh, wow.

452
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:21,285
Is that an original 1988 AKIRA
promotional poster from Japan?

453
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,996
No. It's in Spanish.

454
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,122
Oh.

455
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,958
But, I wish.

456
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,018
Dameon!

457
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,354
Dameon!

458
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,026
Dameon!

459
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,589
What? It's not,
like, the first time

460
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,007
I've played with a sword.

461
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,885
Ow, it's hot.

462
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,265
You fool.

463
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,810
You're the only one
who can fight with my sword.

464
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,688
I think this thing
has a real attitude problem.

465
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,274
You know, if this all
happened in the anime,

466
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,735
I'd think it was really cool.

467
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,405
I'm pretty sure
this has happened in anime.

468
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,697
True.

469
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,201
Just add blue hair
and tentacles.

470
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,702
Okay, screw this.

471
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,330
We got to get you
out of here, G.

472
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,707
Yeah, I'm down with that.

473
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,085
C'mon, Trish,
we're ditching these losers.

474
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,379
It's about time.
Let's take my car.

475
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,881
But don't, like,
bleed on my seats.

476
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,007
What the...?

477
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,467
G., yo, G.

478
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,845
- Close the door, Lar-Dawg.
- A little help.

479
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,181
- I ain't getting bit again.
- Go grab the gun, asshole.

480
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,349
Do something.

481
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,353
It's strong. What the hell.

482
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,500
Holy shit.

483
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,889
Yeah, you better run, Hanzo.

484
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,682
Is that a "Kill Bill" reference?

485
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,102
Well, that or
"Samurai Shodown" or...

486
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,898
Did I ever tell you
you're the coolest chick I know?

487
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:59,443
Dude, what the hell
do you have a gun for?

488
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,403
Protection, yo.

489
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,737
From who, Tupac?

490
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,405
Like the seventh graders
are gonna pop you

491
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,948
if they don't get their Nyquil?

492
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,200
It came in handy, didn't it?

493
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,118
Not with you using it.

494
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,204
You got to shoot 'em
in the head, bro.

495
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,748
Let me see that.

496
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,292
Ammo's in the side drawer, Dawg.

497
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,340
G., you don't look that good.

498
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,926
Yeah, I think
I need to see a doctor.

499
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,136
Are we getting out of here soon?

500
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,930
Um, hold on.

501
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,182
Can we just talk about
how that thing just spoke,

502
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,977
like, with words and then
just vanished into thin air?

503
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,104
Not your
run-of-the-mill zombies.

504
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,398
They seem intelligent.

505
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,152
Smart, fast and the living dead?

506
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,570
Great.

507
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,696
We're so gonna die.

508
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,114
Okay, Kara.

509
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,368
You, like, seriously
need to stop speaking.

510
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,667
Yo, dude.

511
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,502
Dude.

512
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,921
Maybe we should
get him some help.

513
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,174
I think it's too late.

514
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,510
I'll miss you, bro.

515
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,517
I'm so sorry, dude.
I didn't mean to.

516
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,812
I didn't mean...
you're my best friend.

517
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:21,693
You
Are my best friend.

518
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,909
Dameon, listen to me.

519
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,620
No!

520
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,830
No, what?

521
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,164
This isn't real.

522
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,667
This can't be real.

523
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,670
This is all some
twisted elaborate dream.

524
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,255
Hey, man.
Calm down.

525
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,257
No, I don't have to calm down.

526
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,092
I can freak out if I want to.

527
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,760
And guess what I'm gonna do?

528
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,803
I'm gonna freak out.

529
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,846
Dameon.

530
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,723
La-la-la-la-la-la.

531
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,182
Here, take this shit.

532
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,018
Aghh.

533
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,060
What?

534
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,645
I don't want to get burned.

535
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,439
You know what I'm gonna do?

536
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,317
I'm gonna go to bed
because that's where

537
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,902
I probably am, in
reality anyways.

538
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,071
Yes, that's what I'm gonna do.

539
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,241
I'm going to bed.

540
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,745
We're screwed.

541
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,874
Hey, Lar-Dawg?

542
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,631
You leave me
the hell alone right now.

543
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,761
Gimme the sword!
Gimme the sword!

544
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,681
Agh he's behind me!

545
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,896
You felt that a little bit,
you son of a bitch.

546
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,746
Hey, man.

547
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:45,419
I'm sorry, but this shit
just got real.

548
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,130
Yeah.

549
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,507
Can we, like,
get the hell out of here?

550
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,051
These things keep coming.

551
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,637
Maybe we should hole up here.

552
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,639
There's probably
more of them out there.

553
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,641
And they're really
hard to see in the night.

554
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,102
'Cause they're ninjas.

555
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,147
Well, yeah.

556
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,149
Who put you dorks in charge
all of a sudden?

557
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,734
You're gonna get us killed.

558
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,777
You mean, between
my encyclopedic knowledge

559
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:15,323
of the undead and Dameon's
new-found sword bad-assery?

560
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,784
Okay, fine.

561
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,954
Yo, if we're staying here,
I'm gonna set up watch.

562
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,289
I'll go first.

563
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,000
Dork number 1,
you take over after me.

564
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,586
Dork number 2,
get your head out your ass

565
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,006
and then take over for him
when he's done.

566
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,926
A few hours ago,
I'm just a normal person.

567
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:39,931
And now I find out my family
are murdered by ninjas

568
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,641
and I'm supposed to
save this world

569
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,018
from some zombie apocalypse?

570
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,353
Hey, wait.

571
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,480
What?

572
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:47,690
How do you know all this?

573
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,072
Why don't you ask Kara?

574
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,033
Yeah, Kara,

575
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,328
what's up with that
freaky Dark Sword?

576
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:06,125
Why did Mr. Undead Ninja
bug out after seeing it?

577
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,920
I...

578
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,632
I just miss my brother so much.

579
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,552
I was going all crazy.

580
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,847
And you thought you'd found
a way to bring him back?

581
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,730
I translated this journal,

582
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,817
and it was all about
this spooky sword

583
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,278
called the Jigoku no Ken.

584
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,281
According to the legend,

585
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,992
it had the power
to raise the dead.

586
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,371
Some ultra-baddie
war lord, Oda Nobunaga,

587
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,040
got his hands on it
during the 1500s.

588
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,001
He used it to conquer
most of Japan.

589
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,963
His trusted general,
Akechi Mitsuhide,

590
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,714
disapproved of his use
of the sword

591
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,552
and betrayed him,
forcing him to commit seppuku.

592
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,471
Mitsuhide then gave the sword
to Akechi Tenshu,

593
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,850
your ancestor, to keep it safe.

594
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,394
He took it as far away
from Japan as possible

595
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,230
and that's how the sword
ended up here.

596
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,650
Nobunaga's elite assassins,
the Koga ninja,

597
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,027
wanted the Hell Sword
to bring their master back

598
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,196
and came after Tenshu.

599
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,740
One of them,
your ancestor, Yuriko,

600
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,117
was in love with Tenshu

601
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,660
and helped him
perform the ritual

602
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,247
to hide the sword
and seal away its magic.

603
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:33,628
Wait, Dameon,
your ancestor was a samurai?

604
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,172
I thought you were Korean.

605
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,508
Half.

606
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,051
My father's Korean.

607
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,305
My mother's Japanese/Chinese.

608
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:47,475
I'm kind of pan
North East Asian.

609
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,979
Well, that explains that.

610
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,898
Now, Kara.

611
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:58,820
You went and found the sword,
the Jiggy Haroken,

612
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,990
to bring your dead brother
back to life?

613
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:06,995
I know it was wrong
but I had to try.

614
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,788
I didn't think it
would end up like...

615
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,249
You mean, you knew
it could be dangerous

616
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,002
and you didn't care.

617
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,130
Do you have any idea
what it's like

618
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,840
to see a loved one in a dream

619
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,303
and wake up just to realize
they're not there?

620
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,640
Or to get really excited
to tell someone something

621
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:31,770
and then all of a sudden
remember that you just can't?

622
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,772
Yes.

623
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,941
I do.

624
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,152
Well, now so does Lar-Dawg.

625
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,988
Let's make sure he doesn't
find out about any of this.

626
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,366
Or else he's gonna go
ape shit on us.

627
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,993
He can just do it.
I deserve it.

628
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:51,039
Hey, don't say that.
What's done is done.

629
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,583
And killing each other,

630
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,294
that's not gonna solve anything.

631
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,965
What you whispering about
out here?

632
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,259
It's not creatine
or blasting or pecs.

633
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,513
So trust me, you wouldn't care.

634
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,683
Watch it, geek squad.

635
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,477
I know we have to seal it away.

636
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,063
Can we do that?

637
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:17,107
Kara, where'd you find it?

638
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,900
Graymalkin Cemetery.

639
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,027
It's only a few blocks
from here.

640
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,947
Then that's where
we'll head in the morning.

641
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,616
Why is this happening to me?

642
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,744
I just finished my econ paper.

643
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,163
It was good.

644
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,958
I was gonna turn it in tomorrow.

645
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,510
Don't worry, Trish.

646
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,263
You'll turn it in.

647
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,146
Dameon.

648
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,689
There's more you need to know.

649
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,107
Yeah, tell me about it.

650
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,984
Why did Kara raise
the Kage ninja

651
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,986
along with her dead brother?

652
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,988
Only a master
of the Jigoku no Ken

653
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,824
could raise a specific body.

654
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,452
Any unfocused use
of the sword's energy

655
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,080
could accidentally raise
random bodies in the area.

656
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,960
And the Kage ninja were in the area.

657
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,963
So was their leader, Shogun,

658
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,799
Nobunaga's best assassin.

659
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,636
He mortally wounded me
when he came after the sword.

660
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,641
Daddy! Daddy!

661
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,311
His fight is ruthless

662
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,271
and one of the best
I have ever seen.

663
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,527
Go! Feast!

664
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,363
Spread our curse
and amidst the chaos,

665
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,616
we will find the Jigoku no Ken.

666
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,109
Hey, Kara.

667
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,110
Couldn't sleep?

668
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,362
No.

669
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,824
I'll get plenty of sleep
when I'm dead.

670
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:34,369
There's that charm we all love.

671
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,832
So, big into anime.

672
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:43,253
Like, an otaku, right?

673
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:48,174
Clearly, I'm no cooler
for knowing this word.

674
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,053
So you're Japanese then?

675
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,514
Nepali, actually.

676
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,974
The anime thing?

677
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,016
I don't know.

678
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,434
I guess in school,

679
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,728
they never really
taught us much about Nepal

680
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,523
and, well, my parents tried,

681
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:08,862
but, it was just hard
to feel connected.

682
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,697
Yeah.
All I really know

683
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,533
is that they have those
really tall mountains out there.

684
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,702
Yeah.

685
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:21,207
My brother was adopted too,
but from Vietnam.

686
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:25,962
Well, I guess anime was
the only remotely Asian thing

687
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:31,467
that was accessible;
so we sort of made it our thing.

688
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,720
We bonded over it.

689
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,638
It didn't matter
that we got made fun of,

690
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,724
because we had each other.

691
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,351
That probably
doesn't make any sense.

692
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,478
No. No, it does.

693
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,938
This may surprise you

694
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,026
but, I still get made fun of
quite a bit.

695
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,904
Well.

696
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,447
I better get some rest.

697
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,573
Great.

698
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,242
I'll guard you...
everyone, I mean.

699
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,869
I'll stand guard... watch.

700
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,120
Yeah.

701
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,247
I'll stand watch.

702
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,458
Idiot.

703
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,004
Sorry, Luke.

704
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,256
Doh!
Ugh.

705
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,681
Agh!

706
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,974
Dude, what the hell?

707
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,351
Ugh.

708
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,603
You're supposed to be
taking watch.

709
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:27,566
I didn't get the license plate
on that truck.

710
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,904
Hey, wait.

711
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,073
Where's Kara?

712
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,784
Where's the sword?

713
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,788
Oh no, she went by herself.

714
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,791
She's taking the sword
to the cemetery.

715
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,125
We got to help her.

716
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,211
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

717
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,464
Why do we have to help her?

718
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,632
Are you serious?

719
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,425
Yes, I'm serious.

720
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,303
She's the one who stole
this thing in the first place.

721
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,555
It's her fault
that all this happened.

722
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,848
It doesn't matter.

723
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,392
She can't do this on her own.

724
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,435
She's gonna get killed.

725
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,772
She took you down, didn't she?

726
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,316
Dude, you're the zombie killer.

727
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,443
You have the power
to stop all this.

728
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,112
For all I know,

729
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,864
this thing could just
shut itself off at any time.

730
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,284
Look, man, I'm going after her.

731
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,952
Are you coming?

732
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,913
I'm not the one trying to
get in her pants, man.

733
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,832
You can go by yourself.

734
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,459
Wow. Really?

735
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:36,009
All right, man.
Nice knowing you.

736
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,407
Holy shitty tits.

737
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,340
I can't believe
you didn't go out with him.

738
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,383
I mean, that was low.

739
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,052
He's supposed to be
your best friend

740
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,928
and you just left him there
to die?

741
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,930
He just wants to impress a girl.

742
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,099
He's your friend
and that's all that matters.

743
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,561
If that was G. Out there,
I'd be with him.

744
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,229
You're an asshole.

745
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,481
Here's a twist.

746
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,774
We actually made it to morning

747
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,651
so can we please
get the hell out of here?

748
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,945
I'm with you, Trish.

749
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,502
There's my car.

750
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,587
Yeah.

751
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,600
My car!

752
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,894
Trish, don't...

753
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,231
Trish!

754
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,072
Shit!

755
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,495
Trish.

756
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,788
Trish, no!

757
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,839
Lar-Dawg you okay?

758
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,471
Do you see?

759
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,182
Yeah, Gramps.

760
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,309
I see.

761
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,439
Where are you going?

762
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,024
You were right, Larry.

763
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,359
I'm going to help Luke.

764
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,612
Yo I'm getting
these assholes too.

765
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,238
You're gonna get killed.

766
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,200
The way I see it,
I'm already dead.

767
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,994
But I'm gonna go out swinging.

768
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,288
All right.
Let's go.

769
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,207
Gimme a minute.

770
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,090
Okay, take that.

771
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,384
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

772
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:49,011
Hey, hey, c'mon in, c'mon,
get behind me.

773
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,096
Get behind me.

774
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,599
Thanks, man.

775
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,268
I... holy crap.

776
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,727
Are you Lloyd Kaufman?

777
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,563
Yeah, yeah.

778
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,856
You know, I've been telling
these bozoes all over town

779
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,233
for years this would happen.

780
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,818
I tried to warn 'em.

781
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:05,903
Agh, you bastard,
don't you come in.

782
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,365
Lloyd, sir,
what are you doing here?

783
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,033
Listen to me, kid.

784
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,827
We've got to get as far away
from here as possible.

785
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,120
I can't.

786
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,955
I got to go to
Graymalkin Cemetery.

787
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,541
Graymalkin Cemetery?
That's ground zero.

788
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,294
I know. But,
I have to help my friend.

789
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,462
Oh. Oh, a girl?
I mean, a gyno.

790
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,089
We don't say "girls."
It's politically incorrect.

791
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,049
Gyno American.
Is she a gyno American?

792
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,010
- Yeah.
- Yeah. She hot?

793
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,303
Yeah, a little.

794
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,971
She's got that whole
Goth thing going on.

795
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:32,848
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

796
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:34,348
Ha, ha.
Yeah.

797
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,975
Get outta here, you bastard.

798
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,643
Die, you savage bastard.

799
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,853
Oh!

800
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,771
Here, help me out.
Take a few shots.

801
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,148
Now, take it easy
with that thing.

802
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,482
Go ahead, shoot.
Hurry up, hurry.

803
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,402
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

804
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,321
Ha, ha. You suck at shooting,
let me tell you.

805
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:52,033
Here, let me get...
there, see? Do you see?

806
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,452
Aim, you look... get the sights.
Use the sight.

807
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,121
Now, how are you
who can't shoot for shit,

808
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,123
how are you
supposed to save that gyno?

809
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,250
How are you gonna save
your gyno friend?

810
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,668
I don't know.

811
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,337
My best friend,
he was supposed to help me

812
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,797
but, he chickened out.

813
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,341
Chickened out?
Chickened out, that...

814
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,217
you mean, he turned into
a chicken zombie?

815
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,260
- No, no.
- No, no, no.

816
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,345
No, no, no, no.

817
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,763
No.

818
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,389
He was too scared
to come help me.

819
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,974
Well, kind of seems reasonable.

820
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,976
I mean, this is
some scary shit, man.

821
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,771
I know, but I've always
been there for him and...

822
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,814
You know, fear is
overpowering, young man.

823
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,359
If your buddy has a habit
of giving in to it,

824
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,943
he's gonna need your help.

825
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,820
Well, maybe.

826
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,238
You've got to ask yourself,

827
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,368
did he abandon you
or did you abandon him?

828
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,286
But he refused to help me.

829
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,121
Look, help him face his fear

830
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,750
and your friend will
follow you to hell and back.

831
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,043
Okay, ha, ha, ha.

832
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,253
Here we go.

833
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,713
Okay.

834
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,092
How'd you like that, huh?

835
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,177
Ohh!

836
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,429
He said some pretty
messed up things.

837
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,390
Good friends
always forgive each other.

838
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,641
That's what life's all about.

839
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,267
That's called sensitivity.

840
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,519
Agh, you bastards.

841
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,978
I'll blow your balls off.

842
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,023
Yeah.

843
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,316
I should have time
to go back for him.

844
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,859
Yeah, yeah.
You do that. You go.

845
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,737
Go catch him, go save the gyno
and be a hero.

846
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,031
I'll hold them off.

848
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,451
Oh, yeah, out of ammo, again.

849
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,620
Ah-hah!

850
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,123
Okay, Guadalcanal,
ha, ha, ha, Vietnam,

851
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,958
ha, ha, Oliver Stone.

852
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,084
Yeah, yeah, you.

853
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,673
Turn around and bend over,
you zombie douche bags.

854
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:34,051
Yeah. Hey, hey,
what are you doing to me?

855
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,817
Let's take a short cut.

856
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,569
Isn't that just
asking for trouble?

857
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,070
What do you think this is?

858
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,239
C'mon.

859
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,501
Well, shit.

860
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,881
At least we didn't get
dressed up for nothing.

861
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,095
Let's go.

862
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:39,950
That was...
that was freakin' awesome.

863
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,536
Thank you.

864
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,704
Yo, ass-wipe.

865
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,790
Lose your virginity later.

866
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,463
Sorry, excuse me a second.

867
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,133
What's the matter, Larry?

868
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,384
Can't keep up?

869
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,804
What?
I just took one down.

870
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,306
Is that all?

871
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,350
Two, three.

872
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:05,977
Oh, no, you didn't.

873
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,026
Hey, wait!

874
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,904
I'm Melody.

875
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,322
Um, I'm...

876
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,491
I just wanted to thank you.

877
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,576
Oh, it was nothing.

878
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,744
Really.

879
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,372
I was gonna kill it anyways.

880
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,374
What the hell are you doing?

881
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,708
I think I should go now.

882
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,253
Here, let me see your phone.

883
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,505
You got to be shittin' me?

884
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,590
See, look.
We can bump.

885
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,551
Oh, sick.

886
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:38,717
That's what that does?

887
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,010
Hey, you want to, oh,

888
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,929
I dunno, focus for two minutes?

889
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,559
And now we're tied.

890
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,768
Doesn't count.

891
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,937
Yo, she turned.

892
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:54,441
Damn, down to two rounds.

893
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,776
Hey, so...

894
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,194
Come on.

895
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,445
Guess I'll be seeing you.

896
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,865
World doesn't end,
I'll call you.

897
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,659
Was about to use
one of them two on you.

898
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:09,164
That's what I got
for taking the shortcut.

899
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:48,997
Woo-hoo!

900
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,210
Dude, that was, like, 15 feet.

901
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,420
I think I could
really get used to

902
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,089
this whole superhero thing.

903
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,927
Oh, so you're a superhero now?
Would you look at that.

904
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,386
Dameon's all growns up.

905
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,055
Yeah, and I can't
wait to show Luke

906
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,974
all the ass I can kick
and all the numbers that I got.

907
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,726
He's gonna be so jealous.

908
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,977
Numbers?

909
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,896
Oh, boy, count 'em.
You got one.

910
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:14,940
For now.

911
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,201
No.

912
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,119
- No.
- Hey, man.

913
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,496
We should keep moving.

914
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,289
I mean, Kara might be out there.

915
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,000
It can't end like this.

916
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,752
I was such an ass.

917
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,629
I should have went with him.

918
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,506
It's all right, man.

919
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,093
You thought you were losing
your best friend to a girl.

920
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,344
I get it.

921
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,512
I mean, if G. Were around...

922
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:47,597
Kill it!

923
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,462
- Did I get him?
- Luke.

924
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,755
You're still alive.

925
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,548
Oh, barely.

926
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,799
Did we win?

927
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,384
You okay?

928
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,594
I'm sorry.

929
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,263
Dude, it's cool.

930
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,474
Sorry, I shouldn't have put you
on the spot like that.

931
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,517
No, man.
I should have went with you.

932
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,395
Will you two just kiss
and make up already?

933
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,606
We got more problems.

934
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,066
Well Dameon,

935
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:24,068
still too scared
to use that sword?

936
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,569
Hell, no.

937
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,654
These powers are bad-ass.

938
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,740
Watch.

939
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:30,509
Kara.

940
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,344
Go find Kara, Luke.

941
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,971
- But...
- Go!

942
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:35,348
We can handle this one.

943
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,358
Oh!

944
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,527
Hey!

945
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,321
Get your damn hands off her.

946
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,866
Arghh!

947
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:18,223
Kara, look out.

948
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:44,458
Go kill some
mother f-ing zombies.

949
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,252
I got to get rid of this sword.

950
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,139
Hey!

951
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:12,737
Oomph.

952
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,248
Kara, do the ritual.

953
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,457
We'll hold them off.

954
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,012
You undead bastard.

955
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:08,500
Sorry, I can't help
you losers anymore.

956
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,216
No!

957
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,467
Don't be distracted.

958
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,677
Just be done with the ritual.

959
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:22,848
It must end now!

960
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,183
To seal away the sword's magic,

961
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,060
a sacrifice must be made.

962
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,228
Wait, what?

963
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,923
We raised Nobunaga

964
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,175
and if he gets the sword,

965
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:01,095
everyone will die,
this whole world.

966
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,102
Well, then, I guess
I'll just stop him too.

967
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:14,858
We got to get the sword back.

968
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:17,904
Agh!

969
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,623
The girl must
perform the ritual.

970
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:30,791
She must die.

971
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,376
And if you can't do it,

972
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,920
I'll take your body
and do it for you.

973
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,006
It's not your duty anymore.

974
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,549
This is my world.

975
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,348
Not my duty?

976
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:51,645
I gave my life, my soul,
everything, for this.

977
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,189
It cannot be for nothing.

978
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,526
It wasn't.

979
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,445
My world exists because of you.

980
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,045
But I will not let
any more of my friends die.

981
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:21,216
If I can't save them,
I can't save anyone.

982
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,093
Go where your duty calls.

983
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:24,553
I'll take it from here.

984
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:25,971
No.

985
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,931
What did you do?

986
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,766
You're free.

987
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:30,976
You fool.

988
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,978
This burden will consume you.

989
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,813
There's no escaping it.

990
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,149
It's my responsibility now.

991
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,942
I accept that.

992
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,027
Only if you survive.

993
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,280
Wake up!

994
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,960
Luke!

995
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,827
Dameon!

996
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,018
Papa?

997
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:59,606
Albert?

998
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:04,861
Halt!

999
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,197
Thanks guys.

1000
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:14,830
Let me help you one last time.

1001
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,339
Father!

1002
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,701
Thanks, Gramps.

1003
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,746
Gramps?

1004
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:57,789
We did it.

1005
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,332
We won.

1006
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,834
Right?

1007
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,335
For now.

1008
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,713
But we can't
complete the ritual.

1009
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,590
We what?

1010
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:09,134
Turns out there's something
about human sacrifice

1011
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,386
in the fine print.

1012
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,722
I guess I missed that.

1013
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:18,018
But the ninjas zombies
they're dead, right?

1014
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:21,771
Well, dead dead?
Just mostly dead?

1015
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,524
And the Hell Sword,
it's safe with us now.

1016
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,401
No.

1017
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,862
Nobunaga's out there somewhere.

1018
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,781
Shogun released him.

1019
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,117
Shit.

1020
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,661
Luke, your arm.

1021
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,080
I'm all right.

1022
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,917
Whoa!

1023
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,294
You got to stop doing that, man.

1024
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,924
I just have to catch my breath.

1025
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,843
Without the ritual,

1026
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,929
the zombie curse
could spread out of control.

1027
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:57,682
I better get moving.

1028
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,392
And I'm coming with you.

1029
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:02,062
No, Luke, you don't have to.

1030
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,688
Of course I'm coming.

1031
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,775
I'm the Sam to your Frodo.

1032
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,152
I'm coming too.

1033
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:14,742
I guess I can't talk
you guys out of it.

1034
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,121
Let's go kill some zombies.

1035
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,296
Was that your family back there?

1036
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:32,384
The dead are driven
by their life's last mission.

1037
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,344
They were protecting the sword.

1038
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:37,972
But they don't have
a mission anymore.

1039
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,810
They aren't going to
eat people, are they?

1040
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,645
No.

1041
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:46,481
