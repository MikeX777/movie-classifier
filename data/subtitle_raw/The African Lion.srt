1
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,280
From ancient times,
the great landmass of Africa

2
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,840
has been called the Dark Continent.

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,680
The name came
from the early mapmakers.

4
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,560
They knew so little
of this unexplored region,

5
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
they left it a blank on their charts.

6
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,120
For centuries
it remained a land of mystery,

7
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,440
for Africa, like an ancient fortress,
was surrounded by natural barriers

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,320
that kept civilization out.

9
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,640
Across the north, a vast desert,
the impassable Sahara.

10
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,600
On the west, a dense jungle,

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,640
a wall of tangled underbrush
along the Congo.

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,480
In the south, an arid bush country.

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,720
And on the eastern shore,

14
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,920
fever-ridden swamps
became a barricade

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,120
to all who would invade this land.

16
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,880
In time, of course,
explorers penetrated nature's blockade.

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,040
And in the dark heart of Africa,
they found a primitive paradise.

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,920
It was neither desert nor jungle,

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,840
but a broad plain, broken by forests,

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,360
deep lakes, and towering peaks.

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,480
The dominating landmark

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
is the highest mountain
on the continent.

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,720
It stands practically on the equator.

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,360
This is Mount Kilimanjaro,
rising 19,000 feet into the African sky.

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,040
Its crest, thrusting through the clouds,
wears a permanent mantle of snow.

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,880
Here in its shadow, our story begins,
for this is the realm of the African lion.

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
Enter the king of beasts,

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,720
a monarch
come to review his subjects.

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,560
Largest member of the cat family,

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,280
the lion roams and rules
a vast territory.

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,240
On this immense pastureland,

32
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,760
he finds endless herds
of grazing animals.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,640
Here are multitudes beyond counting.

34
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,200
And here in this natural spectacle
is nature's infinite pattern and plan.

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,880
At the moment,
it's a picture of peace and plenty.

36
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,400
Yet over this sun-drenched setting

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,240
there hovers constantly
the shadow of death.

38
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
And the lion is its messenger,

39
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,920
for these grazing species are his food.

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,080
And since this is a <i>True-Life Adventure</i>
in nature's Africa,

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,040
where we meet tragedy,
we may expect to see it.

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,280
And where we find life born anew,
we will pause to view that, too.

43
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
The ruler and the ruled.

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
The eaters of meat and
the eaters of grass, all living together.

45
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,600
Nowhere else in the world
does nature mix her species

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,600
in such profusion and variety.

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,720
This is the wildebeest,
sometimes called the gnu.

48
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
A species of antelope,

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,800
he and his kind
are favorite prey of the lion.

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,640
This is a distant cousin, the hartebeest,
and he's hunted by the great cats, too.

51
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,880
The zebra is the native horse of Africa.

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
His stripes would seem
to make him conspicuous,

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,720
yet he's rarely taken unaware,

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,320
for he's one of the most alert
of animals.

55
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,280
The waterbuck also stays on guard,

56
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,000
counting on dagger-sharp horns
for protection.

57
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,520
To the sable antelope
nature gave a pair of curving cutlasses

58
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,600
and the skill to use them.

59
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,040
But when it comes to
really fancy headgear,

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
the kudu is in a class by himself.

61
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,000
The tiny gazelles are more or less
ignored by the king of beasts.

62
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,760
He considers them
hardly big enough for a meal.

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,960
And here's a species
that's barely tidbit-size.

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,560
This is the dik-dik.

65
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,880
Smallest of all the antelope,
he stands 14 inches at the shoulder,

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,080
just about the size of a small dog.

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,720
This is the gerenuk, sometimes known
as the giraffe antelope.

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,840
Long on neck
and short on nourishment,

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,400
he's another
the lion chooses to pass up.

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,520
The impala, however,
are more to a king's taste.

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,080
But like all antelope,
they're extremely agile

72
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,600
and almost impossible
to take by surprise.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
These are impala in action.

74
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,240
They can cover 30 feet at a bound.

75
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,640
The eland, largest of all the antelope,

76
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,200
also keeps in practice
for a quick getaway.

77
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,440
By some strange instinct,

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,440
the grazing animals can tell
when lions are hunting.

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
If the big cats are just passing through,

80
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,440
the herds will let them come
surprisingly close.

81
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,360
Of course, there's no point
in taking too many chances,

82
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,160
and often a committee keeps tabs
on the prowler.

83
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,240
The lion is one among many
on these plains,

84
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,120
and all have a part to play
in nature's primitive pageant.

85
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,240
Occasionally, the great cats
find themselves

86
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,600
in the company of some little dogs,
the wild dogs of Africa.

87
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,640
Individually, these small predators

88
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,240
would be outmatched
by almost any adversary.

89
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,680
But when they combine their numbers,
it's a different story.

90
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
They run in a pack, like wolves,

91
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,520
and are a constant threat
to the grazing herds.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,320
Among the grass eaters, there's
one animal who's rarely molested.

93
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
He's the African buffalo.

94
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,600
The full-grown bull often carries horns
spreading four feet across.

95
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,080
These broaden at the base
to form a thick shield over the skull.

96
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,520
And so the buffalo, head-on at least,
is practically invulnerable.

97
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,360
Even the king of beasts treats this
formidable fellow with respect.

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,720
The warthog, too,
is well-prepared for defense.

99
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,520
His tusks are razor-edged
and ready for action.

100
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,320
And yet, given the chance,
he almost always chooses retreat.

101
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,200
But not with his tail between his legs.

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,520
This appendage
he carries proudly erect,

103
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,200
a signal to his family that says,
"Follow me."

104
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,080
Sharp eye and sharper beak.

105
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,120
This is the African vulture.

106
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,280
Wherever these birds appear,
it's a sign of disaster.

107
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,440
As nature's scavengers, the vultures
lead a precarious existence

108
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,400
where they're in constant competition
with others of their sort.

109
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
And the rivalry includes jackals,

110
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,240
who now try to keep
some carrion they've found.

111
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,760
But since there's no honor
among thieves,

112
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,400
the vultures take possession
by sheer weight of numbers.

113
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
In nature's scheme of things,

114
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,560
there's room for robbers
as well as royalty.

115
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,520
And so the scavengers are as much
a part of the African setting

116
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
as the lion himself.

117
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,800
Of all the strange creatures
in the lion's domain,

118
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,200
none can top the giraffe,
the tallest animal in the world.

119
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,520
He's three times the height
of a tall man.

120
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
In fact, his neck alone
is sometimes seven feet in length.

121
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,000
The giraffe has a reputation for silence,

122
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,640
yet on rare occasions,
he can make a sound.

123
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,400
It's a weak one, to be sure,
a sort of high-pitched grunt.

124
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,040
And for all practical purposes,
he remains a mute animal.

125
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,640
Here's an odd pastime.

126
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
It's like dueling with buggy whips.

127
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,360
Right now
it's a simple sparring practice,

128
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,440
but during the mating season,
when they're serious,

129
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,400
the blows can be fatal.

130
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,120
On the sidelines, a group of critics
pass on the finer points of technique.

131
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,880
And here's a case of every spectator
having a perfect vantage point.

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
The one time the giraffe has trouble
with his long neck

133
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,040
is when he drinks.

134
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
This is the moment
when he's vulnerable to his enemies.

135
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,080
But when danger threatens,
he can show surprising speed.

136
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,520
He looks like he's running on stilts,

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,960
but his long stride
soon takes him out of harm's way.

138
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,240
To match the giraffe's height,
nature put his dinner table in the attic.

139
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
And so he's a browser

140
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
who finds a special diet
in the high foliage of the African trees.

141
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,560
For some strange reason,
he favors the thorn acacia.

142
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,040
He avoids its sharp spines, however,
by means of an extra-long tongue

143
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,000
which can reach between them.

144
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,440
The giraffe is a gentle creature,

145
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,960
one who never gives
his neighbors trouble.

146
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,680
But this can hardly be said
of the rhinoceros.

147
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
This grumpy species goes around
with a grudge against everybody.

148
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,000
When he hides like this,
he's not playing games.

149
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,120
There are two tons of bad disposition
behind those spears,

150
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,560
and if he charges,
he's as dangerous as an armored tank.

151
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,640
The name "rhinoceros"
means "horned nose."

152
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,440
These barbarous weapons, however,
are not true horns,

153
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
but masses of hardened fibers.

154
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,280
The African rhino carries two,
for double duty.

155
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,600
Because they're so unpredictable,

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,320
the rhinos are avoided
by most other animals.

157
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,320
But this social neglect
doesn't faze them.

158
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,080
They continue on their way,
as ill-mannered as ever,

159
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,800
and they work off their bad tempers
by chasing each other.

160
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,200
The African lion is nothing more
than an overgrown cat,

161
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,960
and like all the tribe,
he likes his comforts.

162
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,320
In fact, he's just about
the laziest animal alive.

163
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,080
And when lions decide to relax,
it's catnapping on a grand scale.

164
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,640
A family of lions is called a pride,

165
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,280
and it includes anywhere from
half a dozen to two dozen members,

166
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,840
all the relatives of several generations.

167
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,680
Unlike most cats,
the lions are family-minded,

168
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,920
and the pride tends to be
more or less permanent.

169
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,920
In rotation, the youngsters grow up,
find themselves mates

170
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040
and raise their own crop of cubs,

171
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,680
the usual litter being four to six.

172
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,240
In the nursery, the youngsters follow
the lazy example set by their elders

173
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,280
and work as little as possible
for their keep.

174
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,560
They nurse with any lioness
that's handy,

175
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,120
and whose mother belongs to whom
doesn't seem to matter.

176
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,200
The lion cub is naturally playful,

177
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,880
and his kittenish actions reveal a close
kinship with his domestic cousins.

178
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,840
In fact, this playfulness
continues even into adulthood.

179
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,320
At this age, however, even in play,
there's the natural instinct for the kill,

180
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,520
and the lunge for the throat
is automatic.

181
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,880
Being true cats, the lions haven't
forgotten how to climb.

182
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,280
But since they almost never
leap on their prey from above,

183
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,080
they have no real need for this ability.

184
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,920
And so when a lion climbs a tree,
it's only for the view.

185
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,240
Around home, the king of beasts
is just another helpless,

186
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,520
good-for-nothing male animal.

187
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,840
The real head of the royal household
is the lioness,

188
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,560
and when she wants
His Majesty's place in the shade,

189
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,960
she says so in no uncertain terms.

190
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,600
And the youngsters know
who's boss, too.

191
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,080
They side with Mother every time.

192
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,960
Aside from occasional squabbles,
the pride is one big happy family.

193
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,080
And as long as everybody's well-fed,

194
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,840
they spend their days
in leisurely contentment.

195
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,840
But if an outsider from another territory
moves in, there's a sudden change.

196
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,760
A strange lioness has no place
in the inner circle.

197
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
And before she quite knows
what's happened,

198
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,800
she's surrounded by snarling fury.

199
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
This is a battle of the females.

200
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
For some reason,
the mothers in the pride

201
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,160
seem to feel this visiting lioness
is a menace to their cubs.

202
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,440
Their logic is a bit obscure, perhaps,
but their actions are perfectly clear.

203
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,240
The male lion plays a minor part
in the affair.

204
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,520
He seems to participate
only because it's expected of him.

205
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,080
But up against an enraged lioness,
his heart isn't really in it.

206
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,720
In the end,
the intruder manages to beat a retreat,

207
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,880
considerably the worse for wear.

208
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,120
And now that peace has been restored,

209
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
the pride resumes
its normal lazy routine.

210
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
But now, some more outsiders
arrive on the scene,

211
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,320
and the elephants
may not be so easily driven away.

212
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
Here comes the herd bull,

213
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,000
with something more on his mind
than a social call.

214
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,840
Elephants are used to having
their own way,

215
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,120
and this one,
with the herd in his charge,

216
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,760
obviously doesn't want lions
in the vicinity.

217
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,320
This time, the lions choose discretion
and a dignified withdrawal.

218
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,640
Indeed, if there's one species
to whom the king of beasts

219
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,320
might concede his royal prerogatives,
it's the African elephant.

220
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,920
In this primitive pageant,
these giants loom largest of all.

221
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,520
In size, the elephants of Africa
far surpass their cousins in Asia.

222
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,640
In fact, these modern mammoths

223
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,280
are the largest mammals
that walk the Earth.

224
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,640
In Africa, as everywhere else, the
daily dilemma of each creature is food.

225
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,200
And the elephant,
with the biggest appetite,

226
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,000
has the biggest problem.

227
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,920
He consumes great quantities of grass,

228
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,040
but he finds it only an appetizer and
takes his main course from the forest.

229
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,920
Strictly a vegetarian,
and by habit a browser,

230
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,640
he eats leaves, branches and all.

231
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,760
These huge animals
weigh from six to eight tons apiece,

232
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,320
and they consume
a good part of their weight every day.

233
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,200
Dinner is a long, drawn-out affair.
It takes time to fill an elephant.

234
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,480
He's a slow eater, but a thorough one.

235
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,520
Methodically, he strips the trees
of whole branches at a time.

236
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,400
The elephant's trunk serves as an arm,
a hand, and a set of fingers all in one.

237
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,320
It's an all-purpose instrument,

238
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,360
amazingly sensitive
and handy for all sorts of jobs,

239
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
from the biggest to the most delicate.

240
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,080
Often when he's brought his branch
to the ground,

241
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,960
the elephant anchors it with his foot

242
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,960
and pulls off bite-size twigs
with his trunk.

243
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,280
He understands
the principle of leverage,

244
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,920
and if he finds himself
with a limb that won't break,

245
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,760
he simply applies extra pressure
with his huge tusks.

246
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,040
The tusks of the average bull
weigh about 50 pounds each,

247
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,280
but record pairs weighing 150 pounds
apiece have been known.

248
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,000
Both the male
and the female have them,

249
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,960
and with these handy tools,
there's little that can resist them.

250
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
They sometimes
uproot a full-grown tree.

251
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,680
In the struggle for existence,

252
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,640
an elephant with only one tusk
is at a disadvantage,

253
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,800
yet this isn't an unusual plight,
especially among the very old bulls.

254
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,000
Put eight tons of pressure
on even the best of ivory and it breaks.

255
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
This wrinkled patriarch
may be 100, 200 years old.

256
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,440
No one can know for sure.

257
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,040
An elephant's age is his own secret,

258
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,800
and in the wild, the years of
an individual can only be estimated.

259
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,160
It's believed, however,
that the lifespan of an elephant

260
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,960
slightly exceeds that of man,

261
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,680
averaging somewhere between
80 and 100 years.

262
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,400
It's definitely known that the elephant
reaches maturity at about 20.

263
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,040
In his teens,
he's still cutting youthful capers.

264
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,200
At birth,
the baby elephant weighs 200 pounds.

265
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,640
In most families
that would be a whopper,

266
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,480
but in this company, he's just a baby.

267
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,920
This little fellow is actually
only 12 hours old,

268
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,440
and he's having trouble
matching his mother's gigantic strides.

269
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,560
The young of most species
are naturally playful,

270
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,840
and a baby elephant is no exception.

271
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,320
He gets a childish pleasure
out of chasing the egrets

272
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
that often follow the elephants.

273
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,720
These birds are attracted to the insects

274
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,560
the herd stirs up
as it moves through the grass.

275
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
But now the tables are turned,

276
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
and they're the ones
being made to scatter.

277
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,800
Young master elephant
may be small fry in his own league,

278
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,920
but in this one,
he can really throw his weight around.

279
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,920
Although the elephant
is called a pachyderm,

280
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,680
which means "thick-skinned,"

281
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,840
his hide isn't nearly as impervious
as it seems.

282
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,720
And so he tries to protect himself
against the bites of bothersome insects

283
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,880
by taking frequent dust baths.

284
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
Elephants are herd animals,

285
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,120
and the herds vary in numbers
from only a few to a great many.

286
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,200
This is the elephant version
of a freight train.

287
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,920
Count the cars and you'll find 110.

288
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,960
While the herd system
provides protection for the young,

289
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,360
it's hardly necessary for the adults.

290
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,360
With their
tremendous size and strength,

291
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,360
elephants, full-grown,
have no natural enemies.

292
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,800
The one thing elephants must have
is water,

293
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,520
and they make long marches to find it.

294
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,520
It takes a good-sized water hole just
to meet their drinking requirements.

295
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,200
Now the versatile trunk
serves as a flexible water hose.

296
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,640
We humans do well to drink our eight
glasses, about two quarts, in a day.

297
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,880
But an elephant siphons up that much
in every trunk-full.

298
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,280
A thirsty elephant can take on
14 gallons of liquid refreshment,

299
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,600
and even Mr. Half-Pint
drinks it by the bucket.

300
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,360
Here's a pair of tusks
that almost got out of control,

301
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,080
and they make drinking
something of a problem.

302
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,440
And then there's the fellow
who makes a game out of it.

303
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,800
Finally, the hose is hung
on a built-in drying rack.

304
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,240
But the ritual at the water hole
has barely begun.

305
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,120
Now, with his thirst satisfied,

306
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,760
the elephant turns his attention
to a shower.

307
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,280
There's no hot and cold, of course,
and it's the muddiest kind of water.

308
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,920
But the elephant enjoys it in spite of all.

309
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,840
To him it's cool and it's wet,
and that's all that matters.

310
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,480
And then comes the big rinse,
and this is the most fun of all.

311
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,200
Ordinarily,
elephants stick to shallow water.

312
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,120
But if they do get beyond their depth,
they are excellent swimmers.

313
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,320
And if one submerges,

314
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,520
he keeps his trunk above the surface
as a breathing tube.

315
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,000
For all its handiness, however,

316
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,160
there's one place an elephant's trunk
just won't reach.

317
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,880
Well, it's been simply grand,
this monumental mud bath,

318
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,280
but all this splashing about
has posed a sticky problem.

319
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,640
How to hoist six tons of elephant
up the slippery banks?

320
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,240
But finally, with a dry footing,
everybody makes the grade,

321
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,040
including the six-tonners.

322
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,280
Here at the water hole,
many species come and go.

323
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,240
But to the hippopotamus, this is home.

324
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,360
A true water animal, the hippo is
thoroughly adapted to his element.

325
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,480
He favors the marshy backwaters,

326
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,960
where he can wallow
to his heart's content.

327
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,640
And he finds
a good mud hole irresistible,

328
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,480
for after all,
the hippo is related to the pig.

329
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,600
Second only to the elephant in size,

330
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,160
the hippopotamus measures 13 feet
around the waistline

331
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,640
and often achieves a bulk of four tons,

332
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,680
yet he's surprisingly agile,
both on land and in the water.

333
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,800
He's usually peaceable,

334
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,280
yet he's well able to take care of himself

335
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,880
in a mock battle, or in the real thing.

336
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,720
The power in these ponderous jaws
is tremendous.

337
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,800
This, except for the whale's,

338
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,560
is the biggest mouth
in all the animal kingdom.

339
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,520
It was the ancient Greeks
who gave the hippopotamus his name.

340
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,240
It means "river horse."

341
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,240
And when his horsy face
is seen like this, the name certainly fits.

342
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,040
Occasionally, company comes to call,
and of course it's for dinner.

343
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,040
This bird is interested
in the tiny parasites that live on hippos.

344
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,160
He's called the lily-trotter,
from his habit of walking on lily pads.

345
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,320
But he's also a hippo hopper,

346
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,840
and his exaggerated feet
are perfect for the footwork required.

347
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,000
The bird makes himself
a sort of personal valet

348
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,480
and goes about tidying up
here and there.

349
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,800
He checks eyebrows
to see if they need plucking.

350
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,800
A bird beautician, as it were.

351
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,760
There's really not much you can do
to help this face, but he keeps trying.

352
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,360
Sometimes he gets carried away
by his enthusiasm.

353
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,520
Then his client gives him the brush-off
by going below.

354
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,120
The hippo's balloon-like build
gives him buoyancy,

355
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,560
and he moves through this underwater
dream world practically without effort.

356
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,320
He's able to close
both his nose and his ears,

357
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,160
and his great lung capacity permits
submersion for minutes at a time.

358
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,080
To renew his air supply, he need only
poke his nostrils above the surface.

359
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,480
The hippo associates with some
strange companions. Now it's the fish.

360
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,040
He's not especially interested
in his finny friends,

361
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,000
but they're more than a little
interested in him.

362
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,400
Here's one of nature's
unexplained puzzles,

363
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,960
why the fish are attracted to the hippo.

364
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,280
It's a good guess, however, that they
feed on his brand of parasites.

365
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,520
These are a carp-like species
called the barbel.

366
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,680
They give him a thorough going-over.

367
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,320
And here's the odd spectacle
of a fish fishing, of all places,

368
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,400
inside a hippo's mouth.

369
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,200
Attracted by all the commotion,
a passerby crashes the party.

370
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,880
This is the crocodile.

371
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,600
And he, too,
has a place in this submarine setting.

372
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,920
Crocodile, barbel, hippopotamus.
Reptile, fish, mammal.

373
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,760
A strange affinity in a strange world.

374
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,520
In nature, the intellect of her creatures

375
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,920
ranges from the not-so-bright
to the near-brilliant.

376
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,480
And for native intelligence,
few can match the African baboon.

377
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,880
Witness his choice of a home.
A rock castle, perfect for defense.

378
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,520
Here's a fortress he can hold
against all comers, even lions.

379
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,360
At times, the baboon appears
to be almost foolhardy,

380
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,520
but he knows every cavern
in these rocks,

381
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,440
and he's counting on a speedy
disappearing act if he needs it.

382
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,560
But lions have more important things
to do than chase baboons.

383
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,600
They know of easier game where
the chase has more chance of success,

384
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,480
and so they move on.

385
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,960
The baboons must leave
their rocky ramparts to feed,

386
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,640
for they are fanciers of
tender grasses, seeds, and insects.

387
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,040
And so for protection, they travel
in troops, numbering from 50 to 100.

388
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,800
The baboon possesses
both manual dexterity

389
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,560
and a discriminating eye,

390
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,000
and only the choicest pickings
satisfy his finicky palate.

391
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,520
Favorite on his list of delicacies
are the stalks of water lilies.

392
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,360
The baby baboon is something
only a baboon could love.

393
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,360
And he certainly gives little hint
that he's a child prodigy.

394
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,760
The moment he finds himself a tree,
however, his talents bloom.

395
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,080
He's a natural-born trapeze artist.

396
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,640
Baboons are playful, mischievous
and full of pranks,

397
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,080
and the youngsters carry on a game

398
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,920
that is one long practical joke
on each other.

399
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,600
All this seems to develop a sort
of good-natured tolerance,

400
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,080
and family discipline
is seldom very strict.

401
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,320
Both parents participate
in bringing up the young,

402
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,640
and Father's just as willing
to baby-sit as Mother.

403
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,920
But sometimes
Junior isn't as willing as Father.

404
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,920
There's never a dull moment
in a colony of baboons.

405
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,160
Besides intelligence,
they possess a sense of humor, too,

406
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,680
and it shows up
at the most unexpected moments.

407
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,760
The worst enemy of the baboons
is the leopard,

408
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,280
often called the tiger of Africa.

409
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,600
He's not a true tiger, of course.
Their home is in Asia.

410
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,160
But for ferocity and cunning,
he more than takes their place.

411
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,320
Because of the leopards,

412
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,640
young baboons are never allowed
to stray off alone.

413
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,920
Mother's watchful eye
is always on them.

414
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,480
And wherever she goes, baby goes,
too, tucked away in a lower berth.

415
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,000
When he's a bit older,
the youngster rides in the rumble seat.

416
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,360
This keeps him from being underfoot

417
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,000
when the baboons drink with the herds
at the water hole.

418
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,840
In the kingdom of the African lion,
there are birds of many kinds.

419
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,160
And here's one who demonstrates
nature's flair for the freakish,

420
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,680
the ostrich.

421
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,160
Seven feet tall,
he towers above the grazing animals.

422
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,600
He's the largest of
all her feathered species.

423
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,600
Technically, this is a bird,

424
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,520
but he can't fly, can't sing,
can't even perch in a tree.

425
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,680
In fact, ostriches can't do any of
the things birds are supposed to do,

426
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,680
except lay the world's largest eggs
and raise extra-large families.

427
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,080
Twenty or more is the usual number
in the brood,

428
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,040
and it takes both parents to ride herd
on this many youngsters.

429
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,080
Here, the drab-colored hens
have charge,

430
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,120
but just as often,
it's the dapper male who's on duty.

431
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,200
Lacking the power of flight,

432
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,000
they've developed their own technique
for survival.

433
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,280
In this land
where so many predators roam,

434
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,280
they depend on long, strong legs
to carry them away from enemies.

435
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,960
With their enormous stride,

436
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,720
they can do upwards
of 40 miles an hour.

437
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,240
Long-legged birds are common
in the lion's domain.

438
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,920
He plays host to storks and cranes
of every sort.

439
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,080
The crowned crane
is a frequent visitor.

440
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,680
He comes bent on courtship,

441
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,120
and he goes about it
in a flamboyant fashion.

442
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,880
And here's a strutter called
the greater bustard.

443
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,760
He goes a-wooing
fluffed-out fore and aft.

444
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,280
It's hard to tell
whether he's coming or going.

445
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,760
And in this state, even he's not sure.

446
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,120
But when it comes to
really high-class strutting,

447
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,000
you can't just out-step
the secretary bird.

448
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,320
He's not showing off, though.
This is serious business.

449
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,480
He's beating the bush for his dinner.

450
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,920
This is how he kicks up a meal
of insects and small reptiles.

451
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,280
The feathers sticking out of his head
gave him his name.

452
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,680
They resemble the old-fashioned quill
pens stuck behind a secretary's ear.

453
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,920
The courser is a wading bird
who practically never wades.

454
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,920
He gets his living on the dry plains,

455
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,680
and in the process,
performs a peculiar dance.

456
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,800
And when he trips the light fantastic,
it's a triple trip with a double dip.

457
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,640
In the kingdom of the African lion,
there are only two seasons:

458
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
wet and dry.

459
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,880
For the grazing animals,

460
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,680
this simply means a time
when water holes are numerous

461
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,200
and a time when they're not.

462
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,640
For these nomads, life depends
on good water and good grass.

463
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
It's when the grass is new
that the young are born.

464
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,120
At birth, the wildebeest calf is weak,

465
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,400
yet is expected to accomplish
the near-impossible.

466
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,080
In a matter of seconds,
he must learn to walk and to run,

467
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,280
for on these wide plains,
fleetness of foot is the only protection.

468
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,320
The predators of the plain are many,
and it's the young they pursue most.

469
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Quick to size up an opportunity,
the leopard plans his strategy.

470
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,760
He knows that the wildebeest,
though fleet of foot, are slow-witted.

471
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,840
He will turn their stupidity
to his advantage.

472
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,320
The leopard hunts by stealth, and now
he moves toward a likely-looking tree,

473
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,200
for his specialty is ambush
from overhead.

474
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,720
A leopard that guesses wrong
goes hungry,

475
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,440
but some strange instinct has told him
the herd will pass this way.

476
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,080
And so, for the moment,
he's content to watch and wait.

477
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,560
Sure enough,
his guess was a good one.

478
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,800
And now, the leopard goes about
his deadly business

479
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,560
with a grim deliberation.

480
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,160
He knows he'll have only one chance.

481
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,800
The instant he reveals himself,
the herd will stampede.

482
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,240
He moves lower, closer.

483
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,680
The nearer he gets,
the less chance of a miss.

484
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,680
And all the while, the milling herd
has no hint of his presence.

485
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,520
Now he drops.

486
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,160
When the leopard strikes,
it's like a lightning bolt from the sky,

487
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,400
and for hours afterwards,

488
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,520
the wildebeest will mill about
in wild confusion.

489
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,360
Sometimes, the African drama is harsh,

490
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,040
yet this is the reality of Africa.

491
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,480
Life and death,
a cycle in endless repetition.

492
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,600
And this is nature's way.

493
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,160
Some shall live for tomorrow,
and some shall die today.

494
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,480
And so, what is tragedy for one
means survival for another.

495
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,400
Before he dines, however,

496
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,360
the leopard carries his prize
into the tree.

497
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
This is a practice typical of leopards,

498
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,080
their way of refusing to share
with the scavengers of the plain.

499
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,800
Among the great cats of Africa,

500
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,600
the cheetah is a matchless hunter,
surpassing even the leopard.

501
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,720
Records of her prowess exist
from ancient times,

502
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,280
for Egyptian hieroglyphics
portray the cheetah in action.

503
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,000
The kings of Egypt recognized
the animals' amazing abilities,

504
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,520
and they trained these graceful
creatures as royal hunting cats.

505
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,960
Slim at the waist,
long through the shoulder,

506
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,040
the cheetah looks more
like a greyhound than a cat.

507
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,240
She walks high like a hound,

508
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,600
and this added height
gives her an abnormal stride.

509
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,360
An extra-large chest,
great lung capacity, rangy muscles

510
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,640
all mean tremendous endurance.

511
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,960
Strangely, one part of her
seems undersized,

512
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,840
the small head jutting out
like some sort of gargoyle.

513
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,640
It almost appears to have been placed
on the wrong body.

514
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,080
And yet it suits nature's purpose,

515
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,080
for everything about the cheetah
is streamlined for super-speed.

516
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,280
Here is the swiftest runner
in all the animal kingdom.

517
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,800
Full out, she can do
an incredible 80 miles an hour.

518
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,800
And so, she simply runs her prey
into the ground.

519
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,840
The sight of a cheetah on the prowl
alerts the gazelles.

520
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,680
They grow tense,
ready for instant flight.

521
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,560
When the cat-greyhound slips
into her ground-consuming stride,

522
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,120
the herd knows it's time to scatter.

523
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,080
In their panic,
some run directly alongside.

524
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,560
But the cat ignores them.

525
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,320
She's picked her victim
somewhere up ahead.

526
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,400
One among all these is doomed,

527
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,280
unless some miraculous escape
takes place.

528
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,520
And in a race with a cheetah,
few escape.

529
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,920
Living as they do,
in the midst of teeming herds,

530
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,520
it would seem the lions
would never go hungry.

531
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,960
And yet, the task of making a kill
isn't as easy as it looks.

532
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,840
It involves strategy and skill,
and sometimes, downright luck.

533
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,720
Day in, day out, the male lion seems
to do little of the actual hunting.

534
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,720
Lazy as ever, His Majesty sits on
the sidelines and strikes a kingly pose,

535
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,240
while the role of provider
is left to the ladies.

536
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,320
And so, it's the lioness
who must take the field.

537
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,400
Her problem is to get close to her prey.

538
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,080
Unlike the cheetah,
she's only good for a short sprint.

539
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,280
After that, the hoofed animals
can easily outdistance her.

540
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,920
She must reach these wildebeest

541
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,800
before they have a chance
to get underway.

542
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,040
It seems a simple matter
to come within striking distance,

543
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,200
yet it requires all the stealth
at her command.

544
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,120
After this first failure,
the lioness saves her energy.

545
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,960
At this rate, the hunt may be long
and discouraging.

546
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,720
If only friend-husband would do
his part here, things might be easier.

547
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,440
A vain hope, however,

548
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,240
for the royal spouse
still rests on his laurels

549
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,880
and wonders what's holding up lunch.

550
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,440
But this is no time to worry
about lazy males.

551
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,080
There's a meal yet to be won,
and a whole pride to be fed.

552
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,720
And now the ladies join forces to work
a strategy commonly used by lions.

553
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,920
The leader circles on a roundabout
course to get behind the herd.

554
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,400
Meanwhile, her colleagues approach
from the front.

555
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,880
They walk in plain sight,

556
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,640
their purpose,
to distract the herd's attention.

557
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,840
The trap is about to be sprung.

558
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,960
But now the wildebeest detects
her presence.

559
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,120
But with lions behind and lions in front,
which way shall he run?

560
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,760
Instinctively, the lioness seizes
the jugular vein.

561
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,840
The end is quick and sure.

562
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,360
Once a kill is made, it must be shared
with the rest of the pride.

563
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,120
And now as the clan begins to gather,
His Majesty, at last, bestirs himself.

564
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,520
Hungry lions seem to materialize
from everywhere.

565
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,680
Uncles, aunts, cousins,
nieces, nephews,

566
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,880
all come on the double
to claim a portion of the feast.

567
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,280
Given the chance to dine,
lions gorge themselves,

568
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,200
fighting each other
for the choicest bits.

569
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,840
Against all these mighty appetites,
a single kill doesn't last long.

570
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,800
And all across the African plain,

571
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,040
this ancient pattern
is repeated again and again.

572
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,440
One day, it's a zebra
who falls prey to the pride.

573
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,640
The victims vary,
but the outcome is the same,

574
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,120
food for the lions and their cubs.

575
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,640
On rare occasions,
a young giraffe is the casualty,

576
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,360
for even among the most wary,
luck may eventually run out.

577
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,920
There are times
when the king of beasts

578
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,600
tries to keep the dinner all to himself,
and then bitter squabbles develop.

579
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,760
It's quite a trick, keeping a carcass
from the rest of the pride.

580
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,600
But here's a lioness who's managed
to reserve a remnant for her cubs.

581
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,280
And now she drags it
toward their hiding place.

582
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,040
If she's lucky, she and her youngsters
will have a banquet all to themselves.

583
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,840
But she's forgotten the scavengers.

584
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,440
Now the jackals join the parade,
ready to dart in at the first opportunity.

585
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,640
They're experts at petty theft,

586
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,800
for they spend their lives following
the lions and living on their leavings.

587
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,000
These fearless little thieves
will face a lioness anytime,

588
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,040
when her back is turned.

589
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,000
Now the hyenas pop up from nowhere,
anxious to join the party.

590
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,160
And overhead,
the vultures materialize out of thin air

591
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,360
and drop in for a free meal.

592
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,880
Vulture, jackal, hyena, scavengers all.

593
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,960
Yet even these, nature counts useful

594
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,640
for they serve her purpose in keeping
the plain free of carrion.

595
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,240
By the time these hangers-on have
taken their toll, there's not much left.

596
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,400
Finally, it's a battle for the bare bones.

597
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,320
This contest between the lioness
and her camp followers never ends,

598
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,960
except in a momentary stand-off,

599
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,840
yet this is nature's way
of providing for all.

600
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,760
The lions kill that many may survive.

601
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,640
And, of course, this includes
the families of the scavengers.

602
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,720
This is nature's plan,

603
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,240
that every scrap of food on the plain
find its way to some hungry mouth.

604
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,000
On the ground below, meanwhile,
the lion cubs arrive.

605
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,520
And it's a meager meal
they find waiting.

606
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,440
Other members of the pride
come forward, too,

607
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,280
to mighty slim pickings,

608
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,760
for after doing all the work,
this is the lion's share.

609
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,400
And poor Mother, as usual, ends up
with the part that went over the hill last.

610
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,440
Since the little meal had to go
such a long way,

611
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,280
the hunt continues.

612
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,200
And now the pride tries a different tack.

613
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,680
They move into heavy brush

614
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,240
in the hope of taking their prey
by surprise.

615
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,520
And here's their chance.

616
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,320
A herd of impala
at their watering place.

617
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,800
Now the pride has a problem in tactics.

618
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,440
This species of antelope is, perhaps,
the most difficult of all to catch.

619
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,560
They decide on a direct attack,

620
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,600
and the shock of a sudden appearance
has its effect.

621
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,840
Now every lioness is on her own.

622
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,680
The trick is to panic the impala,

623
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,200
and then try to cut them down
as they run by.

624
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,680
Here's a game of speed and wits,
with a good portion of luck thrown in.

625
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,160
Of all the hardships nature imposes
upon her African creatures,

626
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,200
there's none so severe
as the annual drought.

627
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,080
The dry season affects all,
from the largest to the smallest.

628
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,960
Even the native catfish
are hard-pressed for water

629
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,000
as their diminishing pools
dry up one by one.

630
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,680
The few drinking places that remain
are in constant use.

631
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,640
And the trails to water
become deep-grooved

632
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,800
across the parched plain.

633
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,240
The elephants meet the emergency
with an amazing display of memory.

634
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,080
They return to the place
where the river once ran,

635
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,320
and they dig their own wells
in the dry riverbeds.

636
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,160
They seem able to scent moisture,
even when it's underground.

637
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,800
Suddenly, like great fans,

638
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,280
the elephant's ears stand out
to catch a distant sound.

639
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,760
In spite of his natural caution,
he moves toward it,

640
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,120
trunk raised to test the air.

641
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,200
It's a strange sound,
one he doesn't recognize,

642
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,880
for it's unlike anything he's ever heard.

643
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,160
He follows it to its source.

644
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,160
And here at the one
remaining mud hole,

645
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,560
he comes upon a desperate drama.

646
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,040
A rhinoceros is trapped
in the churned-up mud.

647
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,600
Completely frustrated,
he beats his head on the ground

648
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,680
and cries out for help.

649
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,360
Another rhino drinks,

650
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,880
and he takes but a passing interest
in this strange dilemma,

651
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,280
even as it must have been
in the time of dinosaurs,

652
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,840
for here is a fossil in the making.

653
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,920
This is exactly how the great beasts
of the past were caught

654
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,080
and their remains preserved.

655
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,440
Here at the water hole,
the same trap awaits all comers.

656
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,960
But some are lucky.
They tempt fate, yet walk away.

657
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,600
In growing panic,

658
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,120
the trapped rhino
renews his frantic exertions.

659
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,040
But two tons is a lot to move
when it's bogged down like this.

660
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,480
His wild groans attract some baboons.

661
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,120
These intelligent creatures, at least,

662
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,000
are willing to study his problem
for a moment.

663
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,960
One, in fact,
tries to think of something helpful.

664
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,440
But in the end,
the baboons can do nothing.

665
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,040
The elephant, too,
has come only to drink.

666
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,080
And finally, he finds the rhino's agony
so upsetting, he panics.

667
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,160
And like all the lesser creatures,
the mighty elephant runs away.

668
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,920
And so the rhino must face
his strange destiny

669
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,120
deserted by nature herself.

670
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,000
Beneath the tropical sun, the heated air
of the plain rises in spiral columns.

671
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,360
And now,
the whirlwinds called dust devils

672
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,480
dance across the scorched earth.

673
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,240
But this is only the prelude.
Soon, the dust storms begin.

674
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,200
And now, a mass migration begins.

675
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,880
Now the herds must leave
this parched country

676
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,240
to look for a new water hole

677
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,560
somewhere beyond the reach
of this blistering heat.

678
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,000
Beset by thirst and heat and hunger,

679
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,360
they must, somehow,
out-walk and outlast the drought.

680
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,480
The lions make the trek, too,

681
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,960
and hunter and hunted march together,
driven by the common enemy, thirst.

682
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,840
Before long, this ordeal takes
on the quality of a nightmare,

683
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,880
and the silent giraffes
stalk this land of desolation

684
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,200
like ghost figures in a dream.

685
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,120
The fierce African sun casts a fiery pall
over the scene.

686
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,920
Desperately, the elephants search
the winds for moisture and find none.

687
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,920
Day after day,
this burning disk circles the sky,

688
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,040
and still there's no relief.

689
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,880
Nature, it would seem,
is without mercy.

690
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,280
Yet, this is Africa,
the real and the ruthless Africa,

691
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,920
where survival is only for those
able to endure hardship.

692
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,800
For weeks on end, the trek continues,

693
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,760
and eventually,
the herds reach new pasture.

694
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,320
And yet,
grass without water isn't enough,

695
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,120
and so they must keep plodding on,

696
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,720
looking for a drinking place
that doesn't seem to exist.

697
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,120
In their aimless travels,

698
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,800
the animals seem to lose
their instinctive sense of direction.

699
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,720
The migration swings in a great circle.

700
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And without being aware
of their mistake,

701
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,480
the marching regiments turn back

702
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,280
in the direction
from which they've come.

703
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,480
They seem to head
toward the dust storm again,

704
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,120
but what looks like a dust cloud
is a swarm of locusts,

705
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,120
a buzzing mass of ravenous insects
come to scourge the plain.

706
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,040
Like storm-driven cattle,

707
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,400
the wildebeest move without plan
or purpose in this blinding blizzard.

708
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,800
This unchecked tide
numbs the very senses.

709
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,240
Interrupted at her meal,

710
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,600
the lioness watches,
stupefied and uncomprehending.

711
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,920
The locust is a species of grasshopper.
He eats natural pasture.

712
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,120
Individually, he consumes
only single blades of grass,

713
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,280
yet when he descends
in a living carpet,

714
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,160
he and his millions devastate the land.

715
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,960
Here's a threat to all the grazing herds,

716
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,360
for if the grass is destroyed,
their future is dark.

717
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,800
Yet, what is famine for one
is often feast for another.

718
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,480
Now the storks descend on the scene.

719
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,200
Still, neither a thousand storks
nor a thousand thousand storks

720
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,800
could begin to control this plague.

721
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,600
These millions of shimmering wings
actually filter the light of day.

722
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,080
Soon, an ominous glow
settles over the land.

723
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,520
In nature's plan, however,

724
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,360
uncontrolled calamity
cannot go unchallenged.

725
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,200
Although the locusts devour
every living blade of grass,

726
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,760
though they denude the earth
to the bare rocks,

727
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,480
nature will restore her world
and bring again new life.

728
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,960
This she does with the tropical rains.

729
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,800
These seasonal showers
are the fountain of life,

730
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,320
renewing and rebuilding
and refreshing

731
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,800
creature and countryside alike.

732
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,240
Now the grazing herds will have
good water and good grass again.

733
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,960
But what affects some must affect all.

734
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,600
Yet, like all the other animals,

735
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,400
the lions must accept
what nature brings.

736
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,400
And the rains must fall
on this ancient land

737
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,320
as surely as the sun
must follow the storm.

738
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,160
And so the seasons turn in their cycle.

739
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,120
And once again,
the lion surveys the great plain

740
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:25,160
where his subjects roam far and wide
across its endless reaches.

741
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,960
Zebra, wildebeest,
hartebeest and kudu.

742
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,520
Sable antelope, warthog,
ostrich and rhino.

743
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,480
Hippo, elephant, giraffe and baboon.

744
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,600
Impala, hyena, wild dog and jackal.

745
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,200
All these and many more pay homage
to the African lion.

746
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,200
With his story told,

747
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,880
our <i>True-Life Adventure</i>
ends as it began,

748
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,320
in the shadow of Kilimanjaro.

749
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,040
And for as long as this silent sentinel
stands guard over the lion's realm,

750
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,760
so long shall the king of beasts
play out his role unchallenged

751
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,720
in the primitive pageant
of nature's Africa.
