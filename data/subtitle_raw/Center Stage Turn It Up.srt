1
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:46,049
-Five, six, seven, eight, nine...
-Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

2
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:50,214
-10, 11, 12, 13!
-10, 11, 12, 13!

3
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:59,628
I love you, guys.

4
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,691
You're doing so good, Bella.

5
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,291
Bring your hands up through first,
and open.

6
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:39,397
How am l gonna learn if you're not here?

7
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:42,668
Just do what l did.
You can learn from the videos.

8
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:46,040
You learned from Mom.

9
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:48,375
The tapes help. Trust me.

10
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:04,755
Dad, l'm leaving.

11
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,095
She's going to
the American Ballet Academy.

12
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:12,426
l'm gonna miss you so much.

13
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,907
Me, too. l love you.

14
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,406
l love you, too.

15
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:51,676
Excuse me, which floor is the audition on?

16
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,950
Following pointe auditions,
we'll continue with adagio,

17
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,079
then we'll pair you for the pas de deux.

18
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:05,885
l'm gonna need you into two lines.
Boys in one, girls in the other,

19
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,725
starting with the tallest to the shortest
and remember who you're paired with.

20
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,430
At best, l can take six girls and six boys.

21
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:19,730
The final decisions
will be posted this afternoon.

22
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:24,606
We have very limited space
for a very limited number of students.

23
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:31,314
As you know, this is the finest
academy in the country. We value talent,

24
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,581
-discipline, respect...
-And a love of dance.

25
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:39,190
Also a good thing.

26
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:42,284
And on a very good day,
we even value Cooper Nielson.

27
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:46,263
Please welcome one of our
esteemed judges and instructors.

28
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,890
You have 15 minutes to warm up.

29
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:54,837
A love of dance.
l was moved nearly to tears.

30
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,205
Hey, we're creating artists, not robots.

31
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:59,540
And besides, l'm here to bring some life
back in this place. Remember?

32
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,603
You're here because your company
ran out of funding and you needed the job.

33
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:04,842
Hey, it's a give and take situation.

34
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:09,013
So, nothing's changed, huh?
l give and you take and take and take.

35
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,291
First position. Demi-plie.

36
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,295
Tendu front.

37
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:54,423
Demi-plie. Tendu back.

38
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,061
Demi-plie. Tendu. Stay on your standing leg,
don't hang on the bar.

39
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,105
-Miss...
-Von Stroh.

40
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:02,504
-Richard's daughter?
-Yes, sir.

41
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:08,071
Nice port de bras. Watch your alignment.

42
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:11,082
-Miss?
-Parker. Kate Parker.

43
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,050
Billy's daughter.

44
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,651
Now the other side.

45
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:22,292
Classy.

46
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:59,356
-Kate Parker? How you doing?
-Good.

47
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:02,730
All right, you're gonna be dancing
here with Mr. Webb.

48
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:03,859
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

49
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:07,463
Okay, sorry. Let's stop.
One more time from the top.

50
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,473
Ready?

51
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:14,208
And five, six, seven, eight...

52
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,520
That is perfection.

53
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,617
Look at those legs.

54
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,687
One of the best dancers, l hear.

55
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:34,459
Really? What else you know about her?

56
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,327
Her?

57
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,635
Look at him.

58
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,640
Hey, nice form.

59
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,183
''Nice form''?

60
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,947
-What is she thinking?
-She's already a whale.

61
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:36,216
We have one last spot to fill for a girl.
Here are the top contenders.

62
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:40,391
Suzanne Von Stroh, Kate Parker, Lily Green.

63
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:43,059
l just don't think that Green
has the feet or the body.

64
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:45,603
Agreed. l vote to lose Parker, too.

65
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:49,105
-l disagree.
-Suzanne Von Stroh has perfect form.

66
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:51,239
Perfectly boring.

67
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,507
She's a classic prima ballerina.
l see a lot of potential there.

68
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:56,944
Yeah, potential funding.

69
00:09:57,015 --> 00:10:00,280
Well, unless we figure out a way
to turn this whole thing into a reality show,

70
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:03,014
academies need funding.
You should know that better than anyone.

71
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:06,990
The Parker girl's got something, Jonathan.
She's got passion.

72
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:10,887
-She's too raw.
-She'll refine her skills in the classroom.

73
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,158
She had plenty of time to refine her skills.

74
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,133
And she's going to need a scholarship.

75
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:22,438
Look, Suzanne has excellent technique
and she might be a superior dancer,

76
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:25,672
but how many Suzannes do we have here?

77
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,175
What'll she bring to the table?

78
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:31,340
<i>How about Sleeping Beauty?
How about Swan Lake?</i>

79
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,713
<i>How about Giselle?</i>

80
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:37,380
How about Twyla Tharp?
Bob Fosse? Jerome Robbins?

81
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:41,623
Can't we do something
that's from the last 50 years?

82
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:05,972
Tommy.

83
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,624
Excuse me, sorry.

84
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,297
Yes!

85
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:59,661
Hey, Bell.

86
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:06,039
Yep. Nailed it. Just like you said l would.

87
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:21,149
l'd like an application.

88
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:23,490
We're filled up for the semester.

89
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:26,429
We require at least one year
of formal training.

90
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,596
-l just need a chance to...
-l need a current resume,

91
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,726
three references and a DVD reel

92
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:35,296
including an adagio, pirouette exercises
and a classic variation.

93
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,864
You. Run towards me, take off on the left,
right leg in arabesque.

94
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:25,614
Well done. Suzanne, right?

95
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:27,886
Suzanne Von Stroh.

96
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:29,889
Okay. Listen up.

97
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,226
Dancing is not only about
focus, precision and perfection.

98
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,724
Dancing is about connections.

99
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:40,168
Connecting with your audience,
connecting with your partners.

100
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:42,604
So, over the next several classes,

101
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:46,440
you'll be dancing with different partners
until we find the right match,

102
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,479
one that has connection.

103
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:52,244
Not only a physical connection,
but also an emotional one.

104
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:57,012
All right? Okay, let's go. Pair off.

105
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,393
-Hi.
-Hey, what's up?

106
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:13,493
Mr. Nielson. l'm Kate Parker.

107
00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:16,769
-l auditioned for you the other day.
-l remember.

108
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,037
l was hoping l could speak with you
about my audition.

109
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,603
Miss Parker, this is the best school
in the country.

110
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,510
-We're extremely selective.
-l know.

111
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:28,644
There are other schools.

112
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,814
But l've been dreaming of studying here
since l was a kid.

113
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,949
-l understand that.
-l'll work harder than anyone else.

114
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:36,892
l mean, if there's something l did
or something l screwed up, l'll fix it.

115
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:39,589
Miss Parker, l'm sorry.

116
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:45,235
l really am. To be honest with you,
l think you've got a lot of talent.

117
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:48,768
But there's nothing l can do.

118
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:58,310
Miss Parker. Tell me something.

119
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:02,542
Why do you think
you didn't get into this place?

120
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,088
Was it because you're not as good
as the other girls that auditioned?

121
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,920
Apparently l'm not.

122
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:11,161
lf you really believe that,

123
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:14,460
then maybe you should go back
to wherever it is you came from.

124
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:24,303
Tough first day?

125
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:31,471
Oh, crap.

126
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,983
The Foundry?

127
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:36,077
l doubt it's your scene.

128
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:40,053
A girl like you.

129
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,487
A girl like me?

130
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:46,319
lt's just different than this place. That's all.

131
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,390
-lt's loud and sweaty.
-And that's your scene?

132
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,062
Yeah.

133
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:55,035
What's that look for?

134
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,446
Sorry l bugged you. l'll see you at class.

135
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,494
Where's my car?

136
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,884
Hey.

137
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:44,983
Hey!

138
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:49,585
l think you guys have got my car.
lt's a '88 Jimmy.

139
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,025
-Michigan plates, right?
-Yeah.

140
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:59,000
-Three hundred bucks. Cash only.
-Three hundred bucks?

141
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:03,770
-You're kidding, right?
-Do l look like Eddie Murphy to you?

142
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:13,343
-Can l have a beer? Thank you very much.
-Here you go, Tommy.

143
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:19,543
Hey.

144
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:21,944
Hey.

145
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,319
-l'm Kate, by the way.
-l'm Tommy.

146
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:29,155
Let me guess. Cosmo.

147
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:35,889
Vodka tonic?

148
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:40,197
A ballerina who drinks beer?

149
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:43,370
That's awesome.
Can l get another one, please?

150
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,635
Sure.

151
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:46,168
Cheers!

152
00:18:48,246 --> 00:18:50,237
-Wanna grab a seat?
-Yeah.

153
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:56,613
-This place is pretty dope, huh?
-lt's not really my scene, remember?

154
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,789
ls that your girlfriend?

155
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:05,625
Lexi? No.

156
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:08,859
She's dating my buddy Sal.
He owns this place.

157
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,126
She seems to be
pretty interested in you right now.

158
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,365
l think they're just sizing you up.

159
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,498
See what you're all about.

160
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:18,665
Maybe l should show them.

161
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:30,076
Hey!

162
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,313
-Dance?
-Yeah!

163
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:31,940
You know her?

164
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,416
Apparently not.

165
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:42,378
-That was pretty sick.
-Thanks.

166
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,816
l don't think there are too many girls
at the Academy that can do that.

167
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,649
Yeah, well...

168
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:52,128
-Maybe that's why l didn't get in.
-For real?

169
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:57,596
l don't know what brought you here,
but l'm glad you came.

170
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:00,160
Kate, my buddy Sal.

171
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:03,239
So, where did you learn
how to dance like that?

172
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:07,437
l could use some of that energy
around here. Can you start tomorrow?

173
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:10,174
Seriously? Doing what?

174
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:13,743
We're a new club. You do it all.

175
00:22:13,818 --> 00:22:15,809
-You in?
-Yeah, l'm in.

176
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,218
All right.

177
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:20,520
Be here at 6:00.

178
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:30,959
One, two, three, on her leg. Five, six,

179
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:35,161
seven, eight. Nice and sharp.

180
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:39,608
Two, three, four. Okay. Okay.

181
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:42,009
Allison. Switch with Suzanne.

182
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:45,442
-One more time from the top.
-Hey there.

183
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:48,713
Let's hustle. Six. Ready.

184
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,187
Seven, eight, and a one,

185
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,383
two, three.

186
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:58,693
-The second lift was really good.
-lt was pretty good, huh?

187
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:04,867
Hey. You two get comfortable.
l'm gonna pair you together this semester.

188
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,564
-Nice.
-Tommy, come with me.

189
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,105
See you.

190
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:12,005
Why don't you try your solo for me?

191
00:23:12,076 --> 00:23:14,203
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah? Give it a shot.

192
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:34,364
Okay. Stop. Stop. Not bad.

193
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:39,134
You know what?
Maybe it'll help if you just take a look at it.

194
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:40,329
Okay.

195
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,938
And.

196
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,358
Wow!

197
00:24:45,837 --> 00:24:49,864
l can tell you one thing for sure,
it doesn't get any easier.

198
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:52,772
-No, man. That was amazing.
-All right. Thanks.

199
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:56,480
l know you haven't been dancing
as long as the other guys. That's fine.

200
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:58,208
l'm willing to put in the work.

201
00:24:58,282 --> 00:24:59,909
-l know you are.
-Okay.

202
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:03,010
But to get to the top,
you're gonna have to find something

203
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,078
that you may not be able
to learn in the classroom.

204
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:09,616
-Like what?
-Like passion. Fire.

205
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,288
Fire?

206
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,260
You wanna be a guy
that brings the crowd to its feet.

207
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,698
Yes, l do.

208
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,264
How do l do that, exactly?

209
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,203
Look outside the box.

210
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:28,575
Find that special someone
or something that gets you excited,

211
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,616
-that truly inspires you.
-Like Suzanne?

212
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:36,453
Hey, if Suzanne's it, great.

213
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:39,818
She's a good dancer,
which is why l paired you together.

214
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:40,949
But?

215
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,492
But if she's not, get creative.

216
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,526
That's what an artist does.

217
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,694
And when you find it, make it your own.
All right?

218
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:13,113
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

219
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:15,051
-Hey.
-Hey.

220
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:18,825
Do you want something?

221
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:21,660
Actually, l've got a favor to ask you.

222
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,126
You got me a job and now l owe you favors?

223
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:25,327
No.

224
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:30,272
l've seen you move
and l was hoping for some help.

225
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:33,606
You've seen me move?
What kind of help do you need?

226
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:38,177
l need help with pas de deux.

227
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:41,178
-Pas de deux?
-Yeah. Couples dancing.

228
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:44,119
l know what pas de deux is. l'm not dumb.

229
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:49,283
Okay, well, l suck at it and l need some help.

230
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,090
-Well, that's why you're at the ABA.
-Yeah, l know.

231
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:56,759
They'll give me steps,
but they can't give me what l really need.

232
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:59,128
And what do you really need?

233
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:02,936
-Fire.
-What?

234
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,207
My instructor told me to find fire.

235
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:09,542
What? And l look like two sticks
you can rub together?

236
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:10,875
Kind of.

237
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:16,849
-Good luck with that one.
-Forget l asked.

238
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:59,925
Hey, Tommy. lf you still need my help,
l need some extra cash.

239
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:03,690
-Okay. Where?
-What about here?

240
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:07,664
-lt's got to be off campus.
-l have keys to the club.

241
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:11,567
l don't know about the club either.

242
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:14,475
Well, that's about all l got.

243
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:18,215
No wait, hold up. The club will work.

244
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,010
-Hey.
-Hey.

245
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:27,247
-What's up?
-Not much. Just trying to warm up.

246
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:32,827
-Are you all stretched? And ready to go?
-Yeah. Good to go.

247
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,963
Liar. Okay.

248
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:39,595
Let's see what you got.

249
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,436
Wait, wait, wait.
Keep your hands here, on my waist.

250
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:48,144
Almost. Let's try that again.

251
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,974
Better. How did you get into this anyway?
You don't really strike me as a dancer.

252
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:57,945
They taught us ballet at hockey camp.

253
00:28:58,022 --> 00:29:01,355
Helps strengthen our ankles
and work on balance.

254
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:03,586
So, you're a hockey player.

255
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:07,427
-All-State, two years in a row.
-And now you're a ballerina.

256
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:11,628
-lt's ''ballerano.''
-Okay, let's try a lift.

257
00:29:11,702 --> 00:29:14,136
One, two, three.

258
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:18,674
Yeah. So, after my third concussion,
l figured l'd try something else.

259
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:20,801
And badminton never came up?

260
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:22,812
An instructor pulled me aside
and promised me

261
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,008
hot girls wrapping their legs and arms
around me.

262
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:30,447
Look, if that's what you're here for,
go find somebody else.

263
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:34,780
-l'm not here to screw around.
-Okay, l'm glad we settled that.

264
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:40,829
And what about you?
You don't seem like the typical ballerina.

265
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:43,231
l don't puke after every meal

266
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,463
and have a giant stick up my ass,
if that's what you mean.

267
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:49,834
But full of grace.

268
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:53,602
-That was better.
-A little.

269
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,188
Okay, we have got to get serious here.

270
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,427
Dancing is about trust. And connecting.

271
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:24,625
Okay. We can connect any way you want.

272
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:29,605
Calm down. Let's try some different music.

273
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,199
You've got to get out of your head.

274
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:39,607
Stop thinking and just try to feel it.

275
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:44,217
All right.

276
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,313
Close your eyes.

277
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:17,472
-Hey, Sal.
-What's up, guys?

278
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:23,314
Just thought you might want to grab a beer
or shoot the shit.

279
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:05,795
lt's perfect.

280
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:35,256
Thank you. That's all for today. Nice work.

281
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:38,785
Tommy. Suzanne.

282
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:44,161
l don't know what you've been doing,
but you look good.

283
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:46,634
-Really good.
-Thank you.

284
00:34:46,703 --> 00:34:49,103
l think l'm gonna talk to Jonathan
about the two of you.

285
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:52,472
<i>See if he can recommend you
to Monica Strauss for The Glass Slipper.</i>

286
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:54,408
Great. Thanks.

287
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:57,644
-Yes!
-That's awesome.

288
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:00,147
<i>What's The Glass Slipper?</i>

289
00:35:00,217 --> 00:35:03,812
Tommy, Monica Strauss is the cutting edge
ballet producer right now.

290
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,479
And she's an ABA alum.

291
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:07,786
<i>She's doing The Glass Slipper
for Broadway.</i>

292
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:12,886
<i>lt's kind of a reinvention of Cinderella.
This is huge. Oh my God!</i>

293
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:16,159
We've got to celebrate.
l'll take us to China Grill and we can have...

294
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:17,791
l haven't had Chinese food in forever and...

295
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,564
Actually, l can't. l already have plans.

296
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:23,161
Well.

297
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:25,465
Aren't you the busy one?

298
00:35:26,477 --> 00:35:27,876
Can l get a rain check?

299
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:29,412
Definitely.

300
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,677
Hey, what's up?

301
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,010
We should go out tonight.
Find out where Tommy's going.

302
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:47,658
This place is pretty nice.

303
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:51,132
Whatever! l watched that game.
You didn't even play.

304
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:00,905
-Tommy.
-Suzanne. Hi.

305
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:02,070
Hi.

306
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:03,537
What are you guys doing here?

307
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:06,013
We make it downtown every once in a while.

308
00:36:09,953 --> 00:36:11,818
So, how about some drinks?

309
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:14,221
Drinks. Yeah, definitely. Come on.

310
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,858
So, what can l get you guys?

311
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,694
-l'll have a Cosmo.
-Make that two.

312
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,233
Vodka tonic.

313
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:27,726
Should have guessed.

314
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:30,400
Can l get two Cosmos
and a vodka tonic, please?

315
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:31,839
You got it.

316
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:36,038
Who's that? Your fan club?

317
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,647
She looks familiar.

318
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:46,749
No way.

319
00:36:50,661 --> 00:36:51,650
Hey.

320
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:55,255
You were at the ABA auditions, weren't you?

321
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:59,666
l haven't seen you in class, though.
l guess it wasn't a good fit, huh?

322
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:03,930
Well, at least you have this to fall back on.

323
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,233
Here's your drinks, ladies.

324
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:09,239
-Here you go.
-Cheers!

325
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:10,541
Thanks, Tommy.

326
00:37:46,717 --> 00:37:48,412
What are you doing?

327
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:50,242
Dance with me.

328
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:56,024
That's awesome. See you later.

329
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:57,617
Oh, no, no, no.

330
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,676
Can l help?

331
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:39,953
Don't you have curfew?

332
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:42,614
You're such a rebel.

333
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:49,124
You want to grab dinner tomorrow night?

334
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,333
l'm working.

335
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,191
Okay, lunch.

336
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:56,632
-Working.
-Okay, now you're just lying.

337
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:58,606
This place doesn't even open till 8:00.

338
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:02,111
Actually, l got another gig.
A catering job with Lexi.

339
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:05,475
Okay, well, when's your next night off?

340
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:08,276
Everybody takes a night off.

341
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,991
Cooper says l'm improving.

342
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,584
-You are.
-Thanks to you.

343
00:41:18,995 --> 00:41:20,587
Now l just have to convince them
l'm good enough

344
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:22,723
to be recommended to Monica Strauss.

345
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:23,788
What?

346
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:25,801
<i>You know all The Glass Slipper
posters around town?</i>

347
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:28,099
Monica's casting that show.

348
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,212
l think you need to lower your shoulders
and lift your chest.

349
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,475
-Really?
-Yeah.

350
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:43,547
Try it like that.

351
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,680
One compliment and now you're the expert?

352
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:50,283
Last l checked,
neither of us fell into that category.

353
00:41:50,727 --> 00:41:54,322
Yeah, but you hired me. l didn't hire you.

354
00:41:54,397 --> 00:41:56,092
Maybe you should.

355
00:41:56,499 --> 00:41:59,400
All right, Baryshnikov.
Let's get back to reality.

356
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:02,097
l'll show you Baryshnikov. Come on.

357
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:06,972
You did it again.

358
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,468
Did what?

359
00:42:13,183 --> 00:42:17,244
lf you're gonna audition for next semester,
you could use a little extra practice.

360
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,517
l think once was enough. Again.

361
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,751
-Are you kidding me?
-Again.

362
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:28,527
One rejection and you're gonna quit?

363
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,563
l've had plenty more than one,
thank you very much.

364
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:35,434
Okay, but you realize
that's what this business is about.

365
00:42:35,505 --> 00:42:38,303
Rejection after rejection after rejection.

366
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,038
Thanks for the tip.

367
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:43,036
You're welcome.

368
00:42:44,214 --> 00:42:48,776
lf you don't have thick skin
and serious drive, you can just give up now.

369
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:52,818
Serious drive?

370
00:42:53,523 --> 00:42:55,491
You woke up one morning
and decided to be a dancer

371
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:58,755
and six months later,
you're at the best school in the country.

372
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,099
You have no idea what it's like
to work your entire life for something,

373
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:08,137
and then have no control
over whether you get it or not.

374
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:10,365
What are you talking about?

375
00:43:10,707 --> 00:43:12,572
Do you know how long l played hockey?

376
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:14,940
Do you know how many times l got
smashed into the boards,

377
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,104
hoping some scout might find me?

378
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,410
Yeah. And you walked away.

379
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:22,576
l didn't walk away. l made a choice.

380
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:25,519
l didn't let somebody else make it for me.

381
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:28,521
What do you care, anyway?

382
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:31,719
Because you're good. You're so good.

383
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:35,459
You know,

384
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,498
l thought l was good.

385
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:48,037
l was so sure l just had that
thing that everyone always talks about.

386
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:55,747
So l packed my bags, came to New York
and l gave it everything l had.

387
00:43:57,454 --> 00:43:59,081
And guess what?

388
00:44:00,857 --> 00:44:02,518
No one else sees it.

389
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,558
My father didn't see it.

390
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:15,001
Jonathan Reeves doesn't see it.

391
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:17,239
lf no one else sees it,

392
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:22,969
you got to think, maybe it's just not there.

393
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:32,120
Hey.

394
00:44:33,456 --> 00:44:35,515
Why don't you take tonight off?

395
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:36,684
What?

396
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:39,292
We can get by without you for a night.

397
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:40,852
You work too hard.

398
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,660
l work too hard? What kind of crap is that?

399
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:44,791
Hey.

400
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:46,969
l just thought you could use a night off.

401
00:44:47,037 --> 00:44:49,665
-Sal, if there's something l did or some...
-Kate!

402
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:51,866
Put down the glass

403
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:53,841
and come back tomorrow.

404
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,675
-Fine.
-All right.

405
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:05,745
Hey.

406
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:11,885
Hey.

407
00:45:13,129 --> 00:45:15,324
So, are you free for dinner?

408
00:45:16,266 --> 00:45:18,166
What did you tell Sal?

409
00:45:19,335 --> 00:45:22,896
l told him an ambush was my only hope
of taking you out.

410
00:45:26,709 --> 00:45:28,802
Can l at least go home and change first?

411
00:45:28,878 --> 00:45:31,779
-Yeah. Of course. Come on.
-Okay.

412
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:44,592
-Reservation for two under Anderson.
-Right this way.

413
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:52,194
So, what are you gonna get?

414
00:45:53,002 --> 00:45:55,266
Fettuccine's pretty banging.

415
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:03,339
So, do you have any brothers or sisters?

416
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:07,082
Yeah, actually. l have a little sister who's 13.

417
00:46:07,484 --> 00:46:09,281
ls she as cute as you?

418
00:46:10,086 --> 00:46:12,054
She's way cuter than me.

419
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,458
That's hard to believe.

420
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:19,627
What about you? Do you have any siblings?

421
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:21,357
Yeah. l have a little brother.

422
00:46:21,431 --> 00:46:25,265
-Really? Does he dance?
-No. He's a hockey player.

423
00:46:25,768 --> 00:46:27,793
Do you want him to dance?

424
00:46:29,606 --> 00:46:31,073
Not really.

425
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:32,335
Why?

426
00:46:32,408 --> 00:46:35,434
l don't know. lt was kind of difficult for me,

427
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:39,846
turning from a hockey player
to a ballet dancer who wears tights.

428
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:44,275
Yeah, but that's what you love.
l mean, if you really love it,

429
00:46:44,354 --> 00:46:47,289
you shouldn't care what other people think.

430
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:48,585
You're right.

431
00:46:50,326 --> 00:46:52,920
l bet your hockey friends
loved it when you started dancing.

432
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:55,556
-l don't know.
-Come on, all those big macho guys.

433
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:58,294
They'd give you crap if you did
anything in tights.

434
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:00,029
l guess l'm lucky.

435
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,068
Have they ever seen you perform?

436
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:04,197
No.

437
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:07,843
Well, they should. l mean, you're really...

438
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:11,271
l'm really what?
