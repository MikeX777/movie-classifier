1
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,100
No! My baby!

2
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,151
The baby...

3
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,086
Something's...
Something's wrong with the baby.

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,190
The baby's fine.
Don't worry about the baby.

5
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,096
Mia.

6
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,732
Mia?

7
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,635
Mia?

8
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,138
Mia?

9
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,839
Mia!

10
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,143
Oh. Sweetie.

11
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,416
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mommy didn't mean to scare you.

12
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,253
- Mommy scare me.
- Mommy just had a bad dream.

13
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,191
I love you, Mommy.

14
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,595
I love you too.

15
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,598
Okay, let's get you
back into your bed, okay?

16
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,401
I don't want to be alone.

17
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:16,304
You wanna sleep
with Mommy tonight?

18
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,406
- That sound good?
- Yes.

19
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,774
Come over here, sweet girl.

20
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,905
Do you want more?
Good job!

21
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:52,973
Got it?

22
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,209
Oh, nice!

23
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:57,211
Is it better to eat
one at a time, I think?

24
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:58,612
A lot easier, right?

25
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,614
Can you eat two more for Mommy?

26
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,850
Good girl. Oh, yeah.

27
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,655
Yeah. Dripping all over.

28
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,592
Are you slurping, silly girl?

29
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,863
You're getting so big,
aren't you?

30
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:19,333
You're big.
You're a big girl now, huh?

31
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,401
There's a peach.

32
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,969
There's a peach.
You're right.

33
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,275
Mommy loves you, Mia.

34
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,682
Come here. Put that down.
Up with Mommy.

35
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,958
Hello, Daniel.

36
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,995
Hello, Rachel.
How you doing?

37
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,363
Fine.

38
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,365
Listen, you have a minute
to talk?

39
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,334
Sure, go ahead.

40
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:57,271
I don't know how to say this, so I'm just...
I'm gonna say it.

41
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,339
Rachel, ever since
our separation,

42
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,875
I'm having a really hard time
paying the bills.

43
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,844
I mean, between the mortgage
payment, the credit cards,

44
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,380
the cars, you name it.

45
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:08,048
I don't know if you noticed,

46
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,385
but the city's placed us
on furlough, and I...

47
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,721
I'm just in way over
my head, and I can't...

48
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,855
I just can't keep
paying for everything.

49
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,290
You're a lawyer, Daniel.

50
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,491
You can handle
our living expenses.

51
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:18,859
I'm a city attorney, Rache.

52
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,495
I don't make the kind of money other lawyers do.
You know that.

53
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,497
What about the money
that we've been saving

54
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:25,299
for the past five years?

55
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,701
I've been plowing through it
just to stay afloat.

56
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,904
That's really unfortunate,
Daniel.

57
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,673
The worst part of it is...

58
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,909
if things don't get better,
I'm gonna lose the house.

59
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,048
You mean, I'm gonna
lose the house.

60
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,652
You can look at it
however you want to.

61
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,420
How else am I supposed
to look at it?

62
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,389
I don't know, Rachel,
but I'm gonna have to pull back

63
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,359
on the money I've been
giving you and Mia.

64
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,695
I just don't see
any other way around it.

65
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,296
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,000
So am I.

67
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,869
You seem to take really good
care of yourself, Daniel.

68
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,937
Have you even once
considered Mia?

69
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,873
Of course I have!
How could you even say that?

70
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,608
Because it's true.

71
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,309
You hardly ever see her.

72
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,847
As soon as I have enough money,
I'm gonna finalize this divorce,

73
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,517
and I'm gonna demand enough
alimony and child support

74
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,951
to take care of us.

75
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,521
You can live in a studio
apartment for all I care.

76
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,490
I'm not the one
that wanted to get separated.

77
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,358
You cheated on me.

78
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,430
I know.

79
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:33,834
I know I did.
I'm not perfect. Rachel...

80
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,104
I know I made a huge mistake.
I wanna go to counseling.

81
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,006
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

82
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,375
And to think
that I actually loved you.

83
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,478
You still love me, Rache.

84
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:47,515
No, I don't.
Don't flatter yourself.

85
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,782
I still love you.

86
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,518
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

87
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,953
You just can't stand to lose
something you thought you had.

88
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,955
Well, you screwed up, Daniel.

89
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,369
At least one of us is happy.

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,522
- Hey, Mia, who's that?
- Me!

91
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,757
That's you!

92
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,460
- Do you like the picture?
- Yeah.

93
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,762
Oh, you're gonna draw too?
Thank you.

94
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:49,677
I know. You're not tired,
but it's bedtime, okay?

95
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,679
It's time to go night-night.

96
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:55,616
It is a big blanket for you,
but it's bedtime, sweetheart.

97
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,718
Okay?

98
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,854
Look outside,
look outside for me.

99
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,923
Can you see?

100
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:07,427
♪ Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪

101
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,082
Dinner is served!

102
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,651
I just put Mia down.

103
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,621
I am so sorry.
It's Brock's fault.

104
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,655
Come in. Yeah, come in.

105
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:38,626
- It's so good to see you.
- You too, sweetie.

106
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,261
- And he falls right over.
- What?

107
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,539
You okay?

108
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,108
Yeah, I'm good.

109
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,710
No, you're not.

110
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,046
I'm good.
What's not to be good about?

111
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,648
You are lying.

112
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,215
I always knew you were psychic.

113
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,785
No, I just know you better
than you know yourself.

114
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,654
She says
that very same thing to me.

115
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,190
So what's going on?

116
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,294
Daniel called this morning,

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:19,900
and, um, he's having
some financial problems.

118
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,936
He's gonna be cutting
the allowance for Mia and I,

119
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,839
and turns out
we might lose the house.

120
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,841
What? How can he do that?

121
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,677
Oh, no.

122
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,713
I can't believe that.
Why? How can that be?

123
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,548
I don't know,
but it's happening.

124
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,550
Well, he's lying.

125
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,686
Do you know
if he's dating anyone?

126
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,821
No. I don't know,
but I don't care.

127
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,690
I just, um...

128
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,558
Because we're not gonna be
getting any more child support,

129
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,326
I'm gonna have
to go back to work,

130
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,696
which means I have
to put Mia in daycare.

131
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,263
- Really?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,665
But I thought you swore
you wouldn't do it.

133
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,567
I did, I know,
but I don't have a choice.

134
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,136
- I have to go back to work.
- Why don't you hire a nanny?

135
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,271
No. That would be a nightmare.

136
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,941
Well, you know
how I feel about daycare.

137
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,577
I think we need
to socialize our kids.

138
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,312
They need to find
their independence.

139
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,147
And virtually every study says

140
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,583
that daycare is beneficial
to a child's growth.

141
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,622
Little Ones Daycare,
it's a wonderful place.

142
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,925
Seriously, I always felt
like the kids were so safe.

143
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,260
And they were happy.

144
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,729
Barbara, the director,
she really knows

145
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,031
how to keep those kids busy
all day long.

146
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,165
And they were just
so well-adjusted

147
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,768
by the time we got them
from preschool to kindergarten.

148
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,704
Okay, how about
if I take you there tomorrow

149
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,905
and introduce you to everyone?

150
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:35,375
Now that is a good idea.

151
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,710
You have time to do that?

152
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,879
For you?
And for my goddaughter?

153
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,114
Of course I do.

154
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,851
Okay. Uh, yeah.

155
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,253
Okay, I'll do it, but,
you know, no commitments.

156
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,622
Just to look at it.

157
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,678
Rachel, what a surprise.

158
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,279
Hey, Martin.

159
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,347
Uh, I'm coming back.

160
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,984
Got any room
for a starving artist?

161
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,752
There's always room for you.

162
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,187
There's a case starting
tomorrow morning.

163
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,855
You can jump on that.

164
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,959
Yeah. That would be great.
Okay, I'll see you then.

165
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,695
See you then. Bye.

166
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,376
Hey, girl.

167
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,719
Come give your auntie a hug.

168
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,086
Hi, sweetie.

169
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,689
- I love you.
- Oh, my gosh.

170
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,390
- So this is Rachel.
- Hi.

171
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,026
As you know,
both of Melissa's kids

172
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,728
graduated from here
at Little Ones.

173
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,429
In fact,
Barbara was their teacher

174
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,865
before she became
the school director.

175
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,434
I was.

176
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,837
Okay, the classroom is just
right around this corner.

177
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,071
Oh, great.

178
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,307
Right this way.

179
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,177
Now we flip it over.

180
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,780
There's a picture here too!
Look at that!

181
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:23,817
All right. We're gonna do this.
It's gonna look fantastic.

182
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:28,789
I know we call it a daycare,
but it's really a preschool.

183
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,791
I mean, we are not babysitters.

184
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,726
Our purpose is to make sure
that they're enriched

185
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,762
every moment that they're here.

186
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,501
Wow. It's really,
it's really impressive.

187
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,738
I mean, the kids all look
so happy.

188
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,173
I don't think
I've heard one cry yet.

189
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,909
Oh, no, no, no.
That does happen.

190
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,978
But they're usually
pretty happy little busy bees.

191
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:55,816
But when they're not playing
or eating or napping,

192
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,118
they're preparing for
the next phase of their life.

193
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,352
This is Miss Wright.

194
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,822
She's been with us
for three years.

195
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,892
This is Rachel, and this is Mia.

196
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,459
Oh, hi.

197
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,396
She's thinking about bringing
Mia here to Little Ones.

198
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,098
Oh.

199
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:14,401
You look familiar.
Have we met before?

200
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,269
I don't think so.

201
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,271
Maybe we've just
seen each other around.

202
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,407
Maybe the market or salon
or something?

203
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,443
Yeah, I'm sure we've
crossed paths at some point.

204
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,313
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

205
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,949
Miss Wright, we need you.

206
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,150
Oh, well, I should go.

207
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:33,787
But it was very nice
to meet you, uh...

208
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,122
Mia.

209
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,325
Mia. That's a very pretty name.

210
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,265
All right, guys, thanks.

211
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,800
Let's see what you guys
are doing over here.

212
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,435
Are you playing with Play-Doh?

213
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,170
That's pretty cool.

214
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,807
We even have a bigger
playground in the back.

215
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:58,846
Oh, wow. Your place is
so warm and pretty.

216
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,381
Oh my gosh, you have a vegetable
garden with real vegetables.

217
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,850
Okay, I have to confess.

218
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,818
My husband, he's the one
with the green thumb.

219
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,987
He's here every weekend
planting something.

220
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,956
And if he's not
planting something,

221
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,859
he's building a new fence,
he's putting together a new toy,

222
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,494
or he's painting a mural
on a wall.

223
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,529
Wow. This place is amazing.

224
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,967
What do you do if there's
a problem or an emergency?

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,003
All of our teachers are
fully trained in first-aid,

226
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,337
but if anything happens,

227
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,439
we'll call you or your husband
right away.

228
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,977
Oh, we're not together
anymore, but, um...

229
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,379
He's around.
I'm the point person.

230
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,015
Okay. I understand. Look...

231
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,886
it's our job to support you,
make your life easier.

232
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,854
So?

233
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,993
Listen, You don't have to make a
decision today. Take your time.

234
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,928
Just bring Mia by
when you're ready,

235
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:48,962
and we'll sign her up.

236
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:49,997
Okay, good.

237
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,865
It was so great to meet you.

238
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:52,933
Nice to meet you.

239
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,935
And it was great
meeting you too.

240
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,037
See you later.
Bye-bye.

241
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,472
I gotta run, but just
give me a call anytime.

242
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,841
- Thank you.
- Bye, honey. Okay.

243
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:05,979
Barbara!

244
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:14,254
It's a no-brainer.
Little Ones is perfect for Mia.

245
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,958
Great. You won't regret it
and neither will Mia.

246
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,259
We know.

247
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,061
What do you say
we go get her comfortable?

248
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,496
Okay. Come on.

249
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,967
I'm really happy
that you decided

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,302
that Little Ones
was the home for Mia.

251
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,938
And, please, call me Gabby.

252
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:34,074
Oh, okay, so this is Miss Gabby.

253
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,143
Okay? Can you say Gabby?

254
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:39,679
- Gabby.
- Oh, good job.

255
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,481
I have to be admit,
I'm a little nervous

256
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,051
to leave her with a stranger.

257
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,219
I mean, I've left her with
people she didn't know before,

258
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,388
but this is different.

259
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,058
Oh, no, no,
but we're not strangers.

260
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,425
Are we?

261
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,995
- No.
- Aw, come here.

262
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,663
I'm gonna make sure that you are

263
00:14:56,696 --> 00:15:01,068
the happiest little girl
in the whole world.

264
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,035
She likes you.

265
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,570
I like her very much.

266
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,473
Hey, how about I introduce you
to some of your toys?

267
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,475
And then you can meet
some new friends

268
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,044
once they get back from recess.

269
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,345
Look at our cool castle.

270
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,314
She's gonna be fine.

271
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,984
I have an idea.

272
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:20,053
Why don't you come with me
back to the office,

273
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,588
fill out some paperwork,

274
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,991
and then we'll come back
in like 15 minutes

275
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,658
and check on her, okay?

276
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,961
Okay.
That's a really good idea.

277
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:28,962
Okay.

278
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,033
Hey, Mia. Hi, sweetie.

279
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,136
Okay, Mommy's gonna be gone for
just a couple of minutes, okay?

280
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,372
If you need anything,
you talk to Miss Gabby, okay?

281
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,109
- You gonna be okay?
- Yes.

282
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,113
Thank you.

283
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,714
I know that this is my job,

284
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,650
but these kids are my life.

285
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,053
They make me whole.

286
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,597
So here's
the Little Ones contract.

287
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,066
Nothing shocking.

288
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,635
Just your information,
month-to-month pay,

289
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,270
release of liability, etc.

290
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,073
Wow. You sure have this place
covered in cameras.

291
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,176
Yes... As a matter of fact,
you can log in to the school website

292
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,145
and view any
of the cameras remotely.

293
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,048
I don't know, I just thought
it would give the families

294
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,117
an extra feeling of comfort.

295
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,220
- So what do you do for work?
- I'm a courtroom artist.

296
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:31,358
I'm the one who gives the visual
when cameras aren't allowed.

297
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,026
Did you go to art school?

298
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,564
I got my undergrad at UCLA
and then my MFA at Art Center

299
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,133
and then I did go on...

300
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,334
Mia. Is that Mia?

301
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,570
Mia!

302
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,705
Mia?

303
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,044
Oh, no, this is Angela, and
her mother just dropped her off.

304
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,746
She'll be okay
in a couple of minutes.

305
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,816
You looking for Mia?
Mia's in the other room.

306
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,285
She's just playing
with the other kids.

307
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,187
Mia, your mommy's here.

308
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,390
See? No worries.
She's adjusting just fine.

309
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:09,229
Okay, sweetie, Mommy's gonna
have to leave right now, okay?

310
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,098
But if you need anything,
anything at all,

311
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,134
you say something
to Miss Gabby, okay?

312
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:17,104
- I love you.
- I love you too.

313
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:23,076
Don't worry, Rachel. We're gonna
take very good care of her.

314
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,079
Thanks, Gabby.
I appreciate it.

315
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,081
Come here, Mia.

316
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,186
Thank you.

317
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,555
We'll see you
in a few hours, okay?

318
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,624
It's gonna be all right.

319
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,218
Rachel! It's good to see you.
We missed you.

320
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,187
So you got kicked out
of the courtroom?

321
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,856
Unfortunately, yes.
We're depending on you now.

322
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,358
Well, I was looking over
the briefing and the sketches,

323
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,859
and it looks like
it's gonna be a long one.

324
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,361
You'll have plenty of sketches.

325
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,164
Can't wait to start airing them
on the 5:00 news.

326
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,431
Find me when you've got me.
I'll be around.

327
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,867
- Sure.
- Oh, and, Rachel,

328
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,271
you know that Daniel's
the lead prosecution attorney.

329
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,239
You could've told me that
last night.

330
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,874
Thought you might not
want the gig.

331
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,144
Yeah, you're probably right.

332
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:53,500
All rise for
the Honorable Judge Joyner.

333
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,240
Good morning.
As you all know,

334
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,908
we're here today to listen
to the case

335
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:06,213
of the State of California
vs. Richard D. Fowler,

336
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,216
who is charged with the murder
of Cynthia Fowler.

337
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,784
The baby!
Something's wrong...

338
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,387
Ladies and gentlemen,
before I begin,

339
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,190
I'd like to thank our jury
for their service.

340
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,360
- The baby.
- The baby's fine.

341
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,762
No, I think something's wrong
with the baby.

342
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,931
The baby's fine.
The baby's fine.

343
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:25,932
- It's not fine.
- Are you okay?

344
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,969
...on the evidence
as presented in the trial.

345
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,672
The opening and closing
arguments of the lawyers

346
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,308
are not evidence.

347
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,579
Do you have a question for me,
Mr. Stevens?

348
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,755
Proceed the bench, Mr. Stevens.

349
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,292
Where did you go, Mia?

350
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,371
Unfortunately,
ladies and gentlemen,

351
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,939
we will have to take
a brief recess.

352
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,309
We will adjourn in 15.

353
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,686
Hi, Barbara. It's Rachel.
I'm so sorry to call,

354
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,021
but I logged onto
the Little Ones website,

355
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,292
and I'm looking at the camera
feed, and I don't see Mia.

356
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,894
That's odd because
I see her clearly here.

357
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,263
If you log on again,
you should see her now.

358
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,399
Oh.

359
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,367
I see her. Thanks.

360
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,502
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,371
It's okay. Unfortunately,
the cameras don't cover

362
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,273
every area of the room.

363
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,774
To be honest, I was a little
hesitant about the cameras

364
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,310
for this very reason.

365
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,412
Everything okay?

366
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,914
Uh, yeah, that's okay.

367
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,450
You know what? It's day one.
I'm sure that my fears

368
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,386
will dissipate
after a few years.

369
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,488
Don't worry.
You can call me anytime.

370
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:57,390
Okay. Thanks, Barbara.

371
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,593
I'll be there to pick her up
in two hours. Okay, bye.

372
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:04,964
Everything okay?
I saw you run out.

373
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,098
Don't you need to be
in the courtroom?

374
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,335
The judge is just working out
some scheduling issues.

375
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,869
Nothing my assistant
can't handle.

376
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,339
So you're okay?

377
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,575
Yeah. Uh...
It's Mia's first day in daycare,

378
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,411
so I'm on pins and needles.

379
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,448
Yeah, I can tell.

380
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,416
If you want to, I can take you
to your favorite restaurant

381
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,951
during the lunch break.

382
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,758
Really, Daniel?
It's Mia's first day at daycare,

383
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,893
and you want to go rekindle
an old flame

384
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,328
that died a long time ago.

385
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:36,629
Don't be so sensitive.

386
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,831
I was just asking you
out to lunch.

387
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,671
I have to go, um, do a sketch.

388
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,373
Okay.

389
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,346
If both the prosecution
and the defense

390
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,548
are satisfied with the schedules
going forward,

391
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,417
I'd like to begin
with the opening statement

392
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,786
from the prosecution.

393
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,388
Thank you, Your Honor.

394
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:15,768
Wow. You made it all the way
to work and back in three hours.

395
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:18,037
Is it all right
if I pick my baby up?

396
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,507
Of course. You can get her
anytime you need.

397
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,609
Just be sure and let Gabby know
when you sign her out.

398
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,910
Thank you.

399
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,344
All right, bye.

400
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:43,730
Rachel.

401
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,532
- Oh. Hi, Gabby.
- Hi.

402
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,400
- So how did she do today?
- She was fantastic.

403
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:51,037
You and Mr. Miller
must be very good parents.

404
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,672
Well, actually, it's mostly me.

405
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,741
He and I aren't
together anymore.

406
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,476
Oh, really?
That's unfortunate.

407
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,847
I'm so sorry. A child really
needs both of her parents.

408
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,115
Well, he's around and just...

409
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,852
Studies actually show that
children who have both parents

410
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,487
do better in their reading
and math scores

411
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,423
and overall
just socialize better.

412
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:16,696
Well, that's not happening
anytime soon.

413
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,699
Oh.

414
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,436
Life has a way of taking us
on a path we don't expect.

415
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,537
I hear ya.

416
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,043
- I'm gonna go pick up Mia.
- Okay.

417
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,579
Oh, you know something,
I just realized,

418
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,680
I was commenting
on your personal life.

419
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,482
I didn't mean that.

420
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,584
Oh, that's okay.
Um, you know what?

421
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,718
I figure we'll get really close

422
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,820
in these next couple months,

423
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,122
and we might as well start now.

424
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,826
Okay. I'd like that, yeah.

425
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,561
Mia, sweetie!

426
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,662
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

427
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,564
Oh, good. Come on.

428
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,668
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad.

429
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,637
- Thank you.
- No problem.

430
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,005
Seems like she had a great time.

431
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,474
Thank you for bringing
such a cute little girl

432
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,909
to our daycare.

433
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,945
All right, let's go.

434
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:23,530
It was her.

435
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,898
What?

436
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,667
I know it was her.

437
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,536
How can you know that for sure?

438
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:33,540
Because, Troy,
I can never forget a face.

439
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,683
She was covered in blood.

440
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,586
You had a concussion.

441
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,587
Her face...

442
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,924
is etched in my memory.

443
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,561
Her face haunts my dreams.

444
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,064
I can't get that night
out of my head,

445
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:01,934
and all I want to do
is forget about it.

446
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:24,991
It's okay, honey.

447
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,894
Daddy just needs to stretch
his legs a little bit.

448
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,896
Show me how
your game works, Crystal.

449
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,698
I can't do it.

450
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,000
You can. You can do it.

451
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,034
Nnnnrrr!

452
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,136
Nnnnrrr!

453
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,945
I need to make it like Miss Leo.

454
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,430
Hey, can you guys help us out?

455
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,799
We've been driving around
in circles. We're lost.

456
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,701
That is quite obvious.

457
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,603
You know how to get
to the 385 from here?

458
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:12,705
I'm not really from around here.

459
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,341
I drive through here all the
time, but I'm not quite sure.

460
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,377
I think you can keep going west
on this road and you'll hit it.

461
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,713
Actually, you know what?
It might be east.

462
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,682
I'll just ask my wife.
She'll know.

463
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,617
No, it's all good, man.
Thank you.

464
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,687
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Thank you.

465
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,856
Don't you have a GPS
in this car? No?

466
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:31,691
It's not worth fighting over.

467
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,558
Have a good one.

468
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,062
Wow. That guy's
seriously stressed out.

469
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,597
Why don't you
go back to Hollywood?!

470
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,636
Sorry, babe. Some people
just don't appreciate you.

471
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,072
I tried to help.
I tried.

472
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,674
- Get in the car.
- Okay.

473
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,741
I love you.

474
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,644
I love you too.

475
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,890
- What's that guy doing?
- What?

476
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:41,327
Those lights. They look like
they're coming straight for us.

477
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,930
Troy, Troy, swerve to the right.

478
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,264
Gabby, we're gonna get hit!

479
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,700
Troy, swerve to the right!

480
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,168
No!

481
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,792
Oh, God!

482
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:19,198
Rachel! Rachel!
Are you all right?

483
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:38,217
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

484
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,886
- The baby...
- The baby's fine.

485
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,854
I know something's wrong
with the baby.

486
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,091
- Don't worry about the baby. Are you okay?
- I don't know!

487
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:48,160
- Are you all right?
- My feet... - Are you okay?

488
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,763
Gabby, Crystal...

489
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,300
Crystal, Mommy's coming.
Baby?

490
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,770
We're okay, we're okay.
Okay.

491
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,115
Ohhh...

492
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,517
No!

493
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,921
No! No!

494
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:17,890
No!

495
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,258
No!

496
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,931
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

497
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:31,003
No!

498
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,201
I looked in her eyes.

499
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,837
We connected.

500
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,839
And I saw Crystal.

501
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,809
Our baby was there.

502
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,820
God has a plan for us.

503
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,627
She's gonna be ours soon.

504
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,030
Gabby...

505
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:34,233
what are you talking about?

506
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,538
What, do you think this was
some sort of coincidence

507
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,574
that Rachel brought her child
into my classroom?

508
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,144
That's not a coincidence.

509
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,314
Gabby, that wasn't Crystal.

510
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,416
Crystal's dead.

511
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,419
No. No, I saw Crystal.

512
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,922
I was with Crystal.

513
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:59,158
Oh, Gabby, please.

514
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,893
Please just
get yourself together, okay?

515
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:04,130
It was just a coincidence.
That's all.

516
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,898
Sweetie?

517
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,437
Dig deep with me.

518
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,372
Think about this.

519
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,509
God gave us
a second chance here.

520
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:22,314
He's done the work, and now
we have to do the rest of it.

521
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:23,916
Baby, we can be whole again.

522
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,619
No. No, we can't be whole.

523
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,056
Gabby, I'm paralyzed.

524
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,124
I'm never gonna be able
to walk again.

525
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:33,993
You have no idea what it's like.

526
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,128
Not what I meant.
That's not what I meant.

527
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,264
I meant...

528
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,232
I meant that we could be
a family again.

529
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:46,372
I meant that we can move on
with our lives from...

530
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,274
this.

531
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,046
I care about Crystal.

532
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:59,451
I care about her so much.
I want this. Give me this.

533
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:10,129
Then we'll just go pick her up
and take her home tomorrow.

534
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,630
Don't be stupid.

535
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,535
It's too easy.
No one can suspect anything.

536
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,204
We're gonna be raising
a little girl.

537
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:22,574
We can't be running from the law
for the rest of our lives.

538
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,510
No, Mia and I need to spend
some time together,

539
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:29,115
and I need to get to know her,
and she...

540
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,517
She needs to love me.

541
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,154
She's three years old.
Give her a teddy bear.

542
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,323
She'll love that.
Tell her that's her mother.

543
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,991
Don't say that.

544
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,060
She's a human being.
She's smart.

545
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:46,098
What about her mother?

546
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,003
She recognize you?

547
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,339
No.

548
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:59,178
She didn't recognize me
because we're nothing to her.

549
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,479
She didn't care
about Crystal then,

550
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,781
and she doesn't care
about her now.

551
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,350
What about him?

552
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,752
They're divorced.

553
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:12,258
He's just around Mia when
it's convenient for him, so...

554
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,494
Look, he's a bad father.

555
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:21,333
You're gonna be a good father.

556
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:26,172
God chose you.

557
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,274
Come here.

558
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,442
Come here.

559
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,678
Baby, this is our second chance.
Can't you see that?

560
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:36,548
I'm sorry, baby,
with all my heart.

561
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:41,120
We were dealt a really bad hand,
weren't we?

562
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,156
Well, yeah, we were.

563
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,760
But this is the way
to make it right.

564
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,263
I love you.

565
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,133
I'll do anything for us
to be a family again.

566
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,802
You know that, right?

567
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:01,173
Yeah, I know that,
and I love you too.

568
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,129
Okay, so today
Mommy's gonna be gone

569
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,865
a little bit longer
than I was before, okay?

570
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,067
The day was fun.

571
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,806
Oh, good.
And do you like your teachers?

572
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,709
- I like Miss Becca.
- Do you like Miss Gabby?

573
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,278
- Yes.
- Yeah?

574
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,280
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

575
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,148
Hi, Mia.

576
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,882
She had a really
great time yesterday.

577
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,218
And you're gonna
have fun again today too.

578
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,820
Mommy, not go.

579
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,189
What's wrong, honey?

580
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,159
Mommy, no work.

581
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,227
I know.
Mommy has to work.

582
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,528
Okay, I'm gonna
give you guys a second.

583
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:57,796
Bring her in when you're ready.

584
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,632
- I have to get the kids started on another activity.
- Okay.

585
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:04,136
Sweetie, listen,
Mommy has to work, okay?

586
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,138
How about this? How about
when I pick you up today,

587
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:09,541
I take you to the pier,
and we go get ice cream?

588
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,210
Does that sound like fun?

589
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,245
Sounds good.

590
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,546
- Ready?
- Yeah.

591
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,248
We're gonna have a blast!

592
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,450
Okay. Uh...

593
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,319
Come on, let's have a good day.

594
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,787
Bye, sweetie.

595
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:33,565
Mr. Fowler, would you be so kind
as to describe your upbringing?

596
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,900
Objection, Your Honor.

597
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,368
The jury does not need
to hear about

598
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,304
Mr. Fowler's family history.

599
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,172
It's an unnecessary drama
used specifically

600
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,873
to pull at the heartstrings
of the jury.

601
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,443
Mr. Fowler's childhood
is not necessary in this case.

602
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,546
No need to waste court time
on an overwrought narrative.

603
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,848
Objection denied.

604
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,850
You may answer the question,
Mr. Fowler.

605
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,818
Sure.

606
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,922
Well, my parents were very poor.

607
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:00,526
When I was born, we lived
on a farm with no power.

608
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,733
Okay, guys, here you go.
What color crayon do you want?

609
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,535
I want purple.

610
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,670
The purple?
Here you go.

611
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,472
Good job.

612
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,242
Okay, kids, now we are all
gonna hand in our pictures

613
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,609
when we're done,

614
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,711
and I'm gonna give you
stickers for it.

615
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,213
No, I don't want to.

616
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:24,383
You need to learn
to follow directions.

617
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,718
Your assignment was to draw
a picture of you and me

618
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,955
living together in a house,
not a horsey.

619
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:34,393
Rebecca, could you please
get some popsicle sticks

620
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,727
from room 403?

621
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,664
Tell Mrs. Choi
that we will get her back.

622
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,332
Sure, Miss Wright.

623
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,508
No daughter of mine
is going to disobey me.

624
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,610
Do you understand?

625
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,812
Look at me.
You need to understand.

626
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,416
I love you more than
your birth parents, okay?

627
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,386
And someday soon
your name's gonna be Crystal.

628
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,888
Do you like that name?
Do you like Crystal?

629
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,324
- Say "Crystal."
- Crystal.

630
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:09,295
Okay, good.
Let's go back to the kids,

631
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:12,264
and I'll give you a treat
if you're good.

632
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:13,299
Okay.

633
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,268
I wanna make
one more picture.

634
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,803
Oh, good, okay!

635
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,472
Well, then you should
definitely make one.

636
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:22,441
You gonna be good now, Crystal?

637
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,510
Here you go, sweetie.

638
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:27,313
Good job, guys.
Very proud.

639
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:39,625
♪♪

640
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,869
You need to understand that
that was not good, okay?

641
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,005
Not good.
You don't do that again.

642
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,640
Don't let me catch you
doing that again.

643
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,510
Is everything okay?

644
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:05,377
Yes.

645
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,780
Um, well, no.

646
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:12,384
Mia and I were just having
a bit of a talk about sharing.

647
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:14,453
She took another child's toy,

648
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:17,923
and we needed to have
a discussion about it, so...

649
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:21,092
- You did?
- No like school.

650
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,395
Well, is everything okay?

651
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:26,432
Yeah. No, no,
everything's fine now.

652
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,535
Okay.

653
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:31,803
I'm gonna sign Mia out.

654
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,050
See you tomorrow, Mia.

655
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,156
I might be out of place here,

656
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:54,860
but what's up with you
and that child?

657
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,961
What are you talking about?

658
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,497
I'm her teacher too.
I should know what's going on.

659
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,769
You're not her teacher.
You work for me.

660
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:06,538
Where's your master's
in child development?

661
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,108
Where's yours?

662
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:13,445
I hear you talk about
all of your education successes,

663
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:16,582
yet I've never seen
any proof of them.

664
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:19,518
Ask me one more question,
you're fired.

665
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,790
I'm sorry.

666
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,092
I didn't mean to hit a nerve
like that.

667
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,126
You did.

668
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,781
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah, it's fine.

669
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:52,551
We just had a bad day today.
We'll see you tomorrow.

670
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,119
Okay.

671
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:01,893
Hi. Do you mind if I talk
to you about something?

672
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,638
Do that, babe.

673
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,039
Ouch.

674
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,710
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
Did Mommy hurt you?

675
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:20,045
Yeah.

676
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,252
What happened?
How did you do...

677
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,220
Mia, listen to Mommy.
How did you do this?

678
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:30,922
Can you tell Mommy
what happened?

679
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,791
- Gabby.
- Something happened with Gabby?

680
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,561
Did you fall?
You fell.

681
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:40,566
Okay, well, I'm glad that
Gabby was there to help you.

682
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,604
Mommy's gonna have
to talk to Gabby.

683
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:46,672
Well, do you remember
who's coming for dinner?

684
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:47,673
- Yeah.
- Who?

685
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:48,874
- Daddy.
- Daddy!

686
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,209
Daddy's coming for dinner.

687
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,945
And you know what?
He's gonna kiss those boo-boos,

688
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,781
and he's gonna
make it all better.

689
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,015
How does that sound?

690
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,617
- Good.
- Good!

691
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,220
Okay, let's go see who that is.

692
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,623
Come here, sweetie.

693
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,091
Okay.

694
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,163
Who is it?

695
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,532
It's Gabby Wright.

696
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,738
- Hi.
- Hi, Gabby.

697
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:20,772
What are you doing here?

698
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,240
I'm so sorry to intrude.

699
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,743
I was in the area,
and Mia left this at school,

700
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:28,313
so I thought
I'd return it personally.

701
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,981
Thank you.

702
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,185
Yeah.

703
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,354
Are you gonna invite me in?

704
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,624
Oh, please, come in.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

705
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:39,825
That's okay.

706
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:41,660
Hey, little one.

707
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,363
Oh, she's tired.

708
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,067
It's a long time
to be at daycare.

709
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,672
Oh, my God,
your house is beautiful.

710
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:56,708
Um...

711
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,215
I don't think
that this is Mia's jacket.

712
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,718
How long have you lived here?

713
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,687
Five years.

714
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,090
Daniel and I bought it
right after we got married.

715
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,693
That's sad.

716
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,232
What is?

717
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,001
Oh, I mean that you're divorced.

718
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,636
I mean, with a house like this,

719
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,872
you're gonna want
to raise a family.

720
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:30,008
Hey, Mia, I'm sure you want some
brothers and sisters, right?

721
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,077
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

722
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,713
- I'm sure she does.
- What are you cooking?

723
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:37,716
- It smells amazing.
- Uh...

724
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:45,991
Gabby, this isn't Mia's jacket.

725
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:49,761
Oh, I could've sworn that I saw
her wearing that this morning.

726
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,063
It's like the size
of a third grader.

727
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:56,401
You know, if the mommies just
labeled their kids clothing,

728
00:43:56,434 --> 00:44:00,739
I wouldn't have to be running
around and returning things.

729
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:04,743
Um, doesn't the school
have a lost and found?

730
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:07,345
Mmm!

731
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,014
I'm really happy
that you came by

732
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,782
because I was
dressing Mia earlier,

733
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:13,084
and I noticed bruises
all over her arms.

734
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:14,085
Oh.

735
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,388
Do you know anything about that?

736
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:21,292
Oh. Barbara didn't
talk to you?

737
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,328
- No.
- Yeah, no.

738
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,397
That's strange because
I told her to let you know

739
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,333
that Angela, the little girl
that cries too much,

740
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:32,303
she's really rough
with the other kids.

741
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,773
Angela did that?

742
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:36,307
Yeah. She's got
two older brothers,

743
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,676
and she's just used
to roughhousing.

744
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,213
I guess that makes sense.

745
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,916
Oh, are you expecting
someone else for dinner?

746
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,752
My husband.

747
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:49,721
Oh, your husband.

748
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,761
Daddy!

749
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:59,230
Hey, there's my little girl!

750
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:01,967
Be careful.
She has bruises on her arm.

751
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,836
- You got some bruises?
- Yes.

752
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,905
Yeah. She'll be fine.

753
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,908
Well, thanks for the invite,
girls.

754
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:12,410
- Hello.
- Hi.

755
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,146
Oh, this is Gabby.
She's Mia's daycare teacher.

756
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,882
You must be Mr. Miller.

757
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,750
You know, I've heard a lot
about you.

758
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,385
I've even seen you on the news.

759
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,920
You're a city attorney, right?

760
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:22,988
I am.

761
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:26,191
That's a thankless job.

762
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,327
But I mean, you know, it takes
someone very special to do that.

763
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,265
Oh, thank you, Gabby.
Hey, have we met before?

764
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,467
You know, I said the same thing
about your wife.

765
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:39,470
She must have
one of those faces.

766
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,072
Yeah, that must be it.

767
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:42,941
- Is that it?
- Yes.

768
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:47,145
Thank you, Gabby, for coming by
and dropping off the sweater.

769
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,885
Um, oh, I... I just thought
I was staying for dinner.

770
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:56,321
I didn't invite you.

771
00:45:56,354 --> 00:46:00,125
Oh, um, okay.

772
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:02,460
I'm just gonna head out.

773
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,398
Uh, Gabby.

774
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,937
Thank you for everything
that you've been doing for Mia.

775
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,404
We really appreciate it.

776
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,874
Oh, it's no problem.
It's my pleasure.

777
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:20,345
I love all my kids,
but Mia here is extra special.

778
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,479
I gotta go somewhere anyways,

779
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,249
so it's probably best
that I'm not staying for dinner.

780
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,084
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

781
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,519
- Okay.
- Bye, Mia.

782
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:35,160
- What was that?
- That was creepy.

783
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:36,962
So that's her daycare teacher?

784
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,897
Yeah.

785
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,932
Come on.

786
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,901
Okay, let's go get some dinner.

787
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:46,271
What are you gonna make me?

788
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,806
Ducks? Really?

789
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,921
You have a good day at school?

790
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:04,455
Yes, good.

791
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,092
So what do you think

792
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,294
about scheduling
a meeting with Barbara?

793
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,862
She's the director
at Mia's daycare,

794
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:12,463
and I just think
we should talk to her

795
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,966
about the bruises
on her arm, you know?

796
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,969
And Gabby's intrusion was weird.

797
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:20,571
Well, what if Gabby's the one
causing the bruises?

798
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:25,476
What if Gabby's
abusing our child?

799
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,878
No, that's not possible.

800
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,579
I mean, there's cameras
in every room.

801
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:30,381
And there's an assistant
with her at all times.

802
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,383
Listen, this stuff
does happen, you know?

803
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,985
Don't be so naïve.

804
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,655
What? I'm not naïve.

805
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,090
I know, I know.

806
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:41,893
That's why I married you.

807
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:42,560
Right?

808
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,029
- Yeah.
- Yes.

809
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:50,301
Maybe we should make
these Wednesday night things

810
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:51,169
a regular thing?

811
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,973
Ooh, I like that.

812
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:58,076
I think that it would be
really good for Mia.

813
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,610
I would like that.

814
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,292
Are you okay?

815
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,027
No.

816
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:18,930
Rebecca didn't show up
for work today.

817
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:22,567
That is just not like her.
I mean, she never misses work.

818
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,135
If something's wrong,
she always calls me.

819
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:27,038
And her phone just keeps going
straight to voicemail.

820
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:28,406
Well, you know what?
I'm sure she's fine.

821
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:31,009
She's a smart girl.

822
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,711
I don't know.
I'm worried.

823
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,513
Does that mean that there
won't be another teacher

824
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:37,348
in the room today?

825
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:40,218
I don't have anyone else.

826
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,987
I would really like it
if you would

827
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,354
periodically check in on Gabby.

828
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,423
That's a lot of work
for one person.

829
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:49,060
Of course I will.
Of course.

830
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,561
Thanks.

831
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:54,099
I really don't mean
to bother you,

832
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:57,035
but I would really like
to have a meeting with you.

833
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:59,370
Anything wrong?

834
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:02,107
I don't want to bother you
about it today.

835
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,308
Just at some point.

836
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:05,143
Okay. Anytime tomorrow
should be fine.

837
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:08,946
I'm sure that we'll know
where Rebecca is then.

838
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,686
Sharks. Did you know
they have poor eyesight?

839
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,057
They can't really see
in the front of their eyes.

840
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,525
I didn't know that.

841
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,427
They have to rely on smell.

842
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,464
- Look.
- School.

843
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,233
Oh, look who it is, guys.

844
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:32,603
Stay here, stay here.
Hi!

845
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,538
Are Mia's bruises
getting better?

846
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,107
They are. Thanks.

847
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,042
I called Angela's parents.

848
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:39,210
I told them about
inappropriate behavior,

849
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:41,212
and it's not happening again.

850
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:43,048
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

851
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:45,050
No, I did.
I definitely did

852
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:48,219
because no one hurts Mia
and gets away with it.

853
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,092
Uh...

854
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,626
Okay, I have to be downtown.

855
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,463
Will you call me
if anything else happens?

856
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,198
- Of course.
- Okay.

857
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:04,135
But nothing will.
It'll all be okay.

858
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:07,105
All right, let's go play.

859
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,507
You wanna sit right next to Mia?

860
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,077
Okay, here.
You can sit there.

861
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,115
I know.
And do you know what they eat?

862
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:18,349
Mice.

863
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:21,519
No, that's not what they eat.

864
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:49,780
You look familiar.
Have we met before?

865
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,221
Mia.

866
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:59,056
That's a very pretty name.

867
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,578
Is everything okay?

868
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,513
No. No, it's Rebecca.

869
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:24,615
What? What happened?

870
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:27,618
They found Rebecca.

871
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:28,619
What? What happened?

872
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:32,123
She was hit by a car.
It was a hit-and-run.

873
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:33,824
They said that the driver
just sped off

874
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:36,161
and left her in the street.

875
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:38,163
Is she all right?

876
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:40,265
They aren't sure.

877
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:43,168
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

878
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:45,670
You know, she was
just such a sweet girl.

879
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:50,208
I mean, the thought of her
being in pain is just...

880
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,177
so upsetting.

881
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,145
Did Rebecca have any
relationship issues,

882
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:57,282
enemies, anybody
that didn't like her?

883
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,184
I don't know. Why?

884
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:03,421
Because we have reason to believe
that this was not an accident.

885
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,289
Oh, my God.

886
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:06,191
How?

887
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:08,226
Witnesses said that they saw
the driver of the vehicle

888
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:09,727
heading straight for her.

889
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:12,530
That is terrible.

890
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,300
No, no, she's a nice girl.

891
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:19,237
She comes from a nice family.
There were no issues.

892
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,705
She never missed a day of work.

893
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,273
Do you know
what kind of car it was?

894
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:24,609
Unfortunately,
the streetlights were very dim.

895
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,211
All we have so far was
that it was a late model

896
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:29,214
dark-colored sedan,
no license plate.

897
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:31,816
One of the witnesses did say
that they saw something hanging

898
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,618
from the rearview mirror.

899
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,486
Something like
a handicap placard.

900
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,888
Wow. Okay, I'm gonna go
pick up Mia.

901
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:41,292
I'll be back to check on you.

902
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:44,362
I'm okay. I'm gonna go
to the hospital and see Rebecca.

903
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:47,298
We thank you for your help,
and we're very sorry.

904
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,166
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

905
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:54,239
All right, guys, today we're
gonna talk about photosynthesis.

906
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:56,241
Can you all say photosynthesis?

907
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,543
- Photo-syn-this!
- Syn-the-tha!

908
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:01,346
Good job.
Okay, so this is a plant.

909
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:04,349
I know you guys all
like plants, right?

910
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,451
Okay, guys, just sit here
for a second, okay?

911
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,185
I'll be right back.

912
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:10,788
- Hi.
- Hi.

913
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:15,526
I was just teaching the kids
about photosynthesis.

914
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,461
How are you doing?

915
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:18,563
Huh?

916
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:21,566
What?

917
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,401
Have you not heard the news
about Rebecca?

918
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:24,869
Oh, yeah.

919
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:27,705
Just terrible.
Terrible.

920
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,307
But between you and me,

921
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,675
she wasn't
a very good assistant.

922
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,410
She didn't have
those motherly instincts,

923
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:33,344
like you and I do.

924
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,283
I didn't know
that you were a mother.

925
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:41,386
I'm not, but, you know,
when the mommies are at work,

926
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:42,553
I'm their mommy.

927
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,389
And Rebecca, she just...

928
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:48,559
She didn't really embrace
that part of the job, so...

929
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:51,696
Okay, Gabby,
you know she might die.

930
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,931
That's not what I heard.
Oh, no, no, no.

931
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,500
I heard that she's just,
you know,

932
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:58,303
she's gonna be in the hospital
for a couple months.

933
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,938
I actually think the time off
will be really good for her.

934
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,446
Yeah, well, we'll pray
for her speedy recovery.

935
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,881
Yes, me and Troy will
definitely do that tonight.

936
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,551
- Who's Troy?
- I haven't told you about Troy?

937
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,286
- He's my husband.
- Oh.

938
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,956
I've just never even heard you
talk about it. Him or...

939
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,426
Well, you know, he's
handicapped, so...

940
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:23,361
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
- He doesn't get out much.

941
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:27,665
No, it's okay, you know,
he's learned to deal with it.

942
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:30,935
I'd better get Mia home.

943
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:33,037
You know, maybe we can get lunch
later this week

944
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,606
and get to know each other
a little better.

945
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,408
I would love that.
I would love that.

946
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,743
That'd be great.

947
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,779
Mia, sweetie, hi.

948
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,818
Okay. All right, say bye.

949
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:50,087
- Bye.
- Bye.

950
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,422
Bye.

951
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:59,364
I saw you learning about
photosynthesis and everything.

952
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,966
I love that she taught you
about that.

953
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:04,802
All right.

954
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:08,673
Here we go.
Watch your head.

955
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,814
How was daycare today?

956
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,816
Miss Gabby made me treats.

957
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:21,719
- Oh, she did?
- Yup.

958
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,921
- No hurt today?
- No hurt.

959
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:25,423
That's good.

960
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,526
Oh.

961
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,394
Hello, Daniel.

962
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:32,129
- Hey. Everything all right?
- Sure.

963
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,999
There's just something
about Mia's daycare.

964
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:37,402
It's those damn video cameras.

965
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:40,971
Every time I see Gabby take Mia
to the corner of the room,

966
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,840
I just get freaked out.

967
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:45,510
I can understand that.

968
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:48,546
She's fine though.

969
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,881
She's with me right now.

970
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,518
She said it was a good day.
No problems in school,

971
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:55,853
although...

972
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:58,789
one of the teacher's assistants
was in a car accident,

973
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:03,561
and the police said that
she was run over

974
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:04,962
and...

975
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:09,767
- And what?
- And that it might have been intentional.

976
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,537
That's frightening.

977
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,871
My mind is spinning,

978
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:16,073
running rampant
with all sorts of thoughts.

979
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,475
Thoughts like what?

980
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:18,576
Like am I doing the right thing

981
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,612
by putting Mia in daycare.

982
00:56:21,646 --> 00:56:23,748
I have to be honest
with you, Rachel.

983
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:27,985
Mia's teacher did seem
pretty strange the other night.

984
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:35,025
I really wanna know what Gabby
does in the corner of that room.

985
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:38,529
Why don't you just stick
a video camera in the corner?

986
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:40,598
That's a really good idea.

987
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,099
I wasn't being serious.

988
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,101
Oh, but it's still a good idea.

989
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,003
I thought you just said
everything was fine.

990
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,972
There's just
something about Gabby

991
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,508
that I can't put my finger on.

992
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:51,942
If you think Mia's in danger,

993
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:52,943
you should be taking her
out of school immediately.

994
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:55,646
I don't... I don't think
that she's in danger.

995
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,449
I just think that Gabby's
taking a special interest

996
00:56:58,483 --> 00:56:59,950
in our daughter,

997
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:04,789
and sometimes it's like they're
having a secret dialogue.

998
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:06,023
Secret dialogue?

999
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,825
- About what?
- I don't know.

1000
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,760
I don't know.
That's why I...

1001
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:11,496
wanna put the video camera
in there.

1002
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:15,466
You can't just go sticking video
cameras in the corners of rooms.

1003
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,233
Why not?

1004
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,702
It's illegal for starters.

1005
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:19,504
Who's gonna find out?

1006
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,572
Well, what if they do?
What if they find out?

1007
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:23,774
And then what? They're gonna
put a concerned mother away

1008
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:27,144
for videotaping a classroom?
Besides, you're an attorney.

1009
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,613
You can make sure
I don't go to jail.

1010
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,481
Oh, great.
Now I'm an accomplice.

1011
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:32,583
I have to go, okay?

1012
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:35,753
We'll talk about this later.

1013
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,805
How many times have I told Steve
to stay off my desk?

1014
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,974
I'm trying to do my work.

1015
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,475
I need time to fix this stuff.

1016
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,715
Maybe if I turn this
upside-down.

1017
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:07,752
Oh, that'll work.
How'd that get on the Internet?

1018
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:09,119
Hi.

1019
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:13,290
Hi. How can I help you?

1020
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,260
I'm looking to secretly
video record someone.

1021
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:18,996
Well, you've come
to the right place.

1022
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:20,965
Cheating husband?

1023
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,800
No. That was
a couple years ago.

1024
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,802
But I'm actually
looking to record

1025
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,804
my daughter's daycare teacher.

1026
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,574
Really?
Well, that's a new one.

1027
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:30,641
All right, well, let's see.

1028
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:34,545
We have um, we have cameras
hidden inside dolls,

1029
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:38,683
pens, books, teddy bears.

1030
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,251
Do you have anything
with live video feed?

1031
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:43,688
Yeah. You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.

1032
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,890
- Okay.
- Follow me.

1033
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:56,667
Hi, Gabby.

1034
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,603
Oh, hey, Rachel.

1035
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:00,905
I am so glad to see you.

1036
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,773
I was just
cleaning up some stuff.

1037
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:05,876
Actually, I have to...
I'll be right back, okay?

1038
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,078
- Just stay here, stay here.
- Sure.

1039
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:30,100
Ohh...

1040
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:32,036
I told them to...

1041
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,139
Hey, you know...
Are you here for something?

1042
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:36,707
Oh, I was just gonna
check in on Mia.

1043
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:39,677
Oh, she's at recess.
You can go out back.

1044
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,779
- Sure. Thanks.
- No problem. Bye.

1045
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:43,681
Bye.

1046
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,711
What's a good song?

1047
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:21,351
Let's play hop in a line.

Okay, everyone, nap time.

1055
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:52,382
All right, everybody,
let's pull out our beds.

1056
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,651
Mia, you stay here.

1057
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:04,695
Look, I don't want trouble.
You do exactly what I say.

1058
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:06,964
I don't understand
why you don't understand.

1059
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,701
No child of mine is gonna cry
like that, okay, Crystal?

1060
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:14,438
You're gonna be stronger
than that, okay?

1061
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:16,440
Tell me what what your name is.

1062
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:20,077
No. It's Crystal. Crystal.

1063
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,947
Say "My name is Crystal."

1064
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,849
And I'm your mom.

1065
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:27,117
Sit, okay? Sit.

1066
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:30,788
I'm your mommy, okay?

1067
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:32,356
Who's your mom?

1068
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:34,191
Look at me, look at me.

1069
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,326
I am your mommy.

1070
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,728
Look at me.

1071
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:39,363
We're gonna go away from here,

1072
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,465
and you're gonna have
a new daddy,

1073
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:44,869
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be awesome.

1074
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:46,904
Where do you want to go?
Disneyland?

1075
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,873
We'll go, we'll go.
Where do you want to go?

1076
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:50,741
Do you want to go
to a water park?

1077
01:01:50,775 --> 01:01:54,845
Listen, okay? I need you
to understand something.

1078
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:57,447
No child of mine is gonna cry
like that, okay, Crystal?

1079
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,883
No.

1080
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,484
Now you tell me
what your name is.

1081
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:01,919
Crystal. That's right.

1082
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:02,619
Who's your mom?

1083
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:03,821
- No.
- I am.

1084
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:05,089
That's right.

1085
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:06,490
Because I'm your mother.

1086
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:07,591
No.

1087
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:11,328
Now, if anyone asks you,
play the little game.

1088
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:12,529
But I'm your mom.

1089
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:16,100
Soon enough, we're leaving.

1090
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:17,134
Okay?

1091
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,040
Do you understand?
I'm your mother.

1092
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,209
You don't have to disrespect
your mother like that, okay?

1093
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,913
You listen to everything
that I say to you, right?

1094
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:32,016
Because I'm your mother.

1095
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:34,018
Okay, Crystal?

1096
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:36,320
Never do that again.

1097
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,239
Rachel.

1098
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,843
Is it time to sign Mia out?

1099
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,880
You know how to get to the 385
from here?

1100
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,888
We need to go.

1101
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:21,866
Um, you don't look well.
You're breathing really heavy.

1102
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:25,169
Hey, can you guys help us out?

1103
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:26,837
That's my wife.
Let's ask her.

1104
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:31,575
Maybe you should sit down
while we finish our song.

1105
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:40,017
Um, Rachel.

1106
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,186
We should really
do that lunch, you know.

1107
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,621
You know, to get to know
each other better.

1108
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,356
Maybe next week.

1109
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:56,433
Barbara.

1110
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,836
What's wrong?

1111
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,373
It's Rebecca.

1112
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:05,275
She's dead.

1113
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,576
Oh, my God.

1114
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,345
She died this morning.

1115
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:16,320
Barbara, do you know
Gabby's husband?

1116
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,388
Yes, I met him once. Why?

1117
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:19,924
Does he drive?

1118
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,126
Sometimes he picks up Gabby
from school.

1119
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,160
Why, Rachel?

1120
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,996
You need to call the police.

1121
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,097
What? Why?

1122
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:29,233
Now!

1123
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:30,100
Okay, fine.

1124
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:32,036
Let me just tell Gabby
about Rebecca.

1125
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:34,972
No. You need to call the police
right now. Right now!

1126
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:41,645
911. What's your emergency?

1127
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:47,384
Yes. We have reason to believe
that my daycare teacher

1128
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:51,021
was involved in the murder
of Rebecca Hart.

1129
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:55,025
We need someone to come to
the school as soon as possible.

1130
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:01,031
Where you going?

1131
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:03,433
I can't leave the children
alone with her.

1132
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:05,902
Oh. Be careful.

1133
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:09,906
I gotta make sure
the children are okay.

1134
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:20,917
Gabby!

1135
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,221
Hi, honey.
Where's Miss Gabby?

1136
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,056
Where's Miss Gabby, huh?

1137
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,524
Where's Miss Gabby?

1138
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:30,927
She's gone.

1139
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,333
How could you have been
so stupid?

1140
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:38,135
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

1141
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:40,237
What did I do?

1142
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,671
You took the license plate
off the car,

1143
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:44,008
and you left
your handicapped placard

1144
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,442
hanging on the rearview mirror.

1145
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,077
- So?
- Oh, just, you know,

1146
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:49,046
Rachel now knows.
She figured it out.

1147
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,981
So what?
It was an accident.

1148
01:05:51,015 --> 01:05:52,582
Sound familiar?

1149
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,484
Oh, you think you're just gonna
get away with this, huh?

1150
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:55,685
Like they did?

1151
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:58,255
At the worst, the cops are gonna
consider it a hit-and-run,

1152
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,389
and I get a slap on the wrist.

1153
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:01,025
There's no way they can prove

1154
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:02,259
that I intended
to kill that girl.

1155
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,094
Her name was Rebecca,
by the way.

1156
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:08,265
Right, Rebecca, the girl
that you told me to kill.

1157
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,000
You're gonna blame this on me?

1158
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:11,235
You told me to do it.

1159
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:12,636
So if I told you
to roll off a cliff,

1160
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:14,004
you would do that, huh?

1161
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:16,040
No, Gabby, I wouldn't.

1162
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:17,574
- I need you, Troy.
- Gabby, listen to me.

1163
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,576
Get ahold of yourself.
The neighbors are gonna hear us.

1164
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:23,047
- I don't care, Troy!
- Where are you going?

1165
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,351
Where are we going?
We are going to get our child.

1166
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,137
- Hey!
- Get her out of the car.

1167
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:50,207
- What's going on?
- Get her out of the car.

1168
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,641
What's going on?

1169
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:55,045
Okay, sweetie,
let's play a game, okay?

1170
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:58,482
Here we go. Quick.
To the house.

1171
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:01,485
Rachel.

1172
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,121
Hey, Rachel.

1173
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:06,190
Rachel, stop.
What is happening?

1174
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:07,391
What's going on?

1175
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:09,326
- It's her.
- It's who?

1176
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,528
You wanna pretend like it didn't
happen and forget it about it,

1177
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,130
but I can't do that, Daniel.

1178
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:15,165
Rachel, what are you
talking about?

1179
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:16,200
The accident.

1180
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,735
Daniel, Gabby is the mother
from the accident.

1181
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,204
What?

1182
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:24,441
You sure about this?

1183
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:27,177
Look at me. I've never been
so sure about anything

1184
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,312
in my whole life.

1185
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:31,148
This is for us.

1186
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,516
I know.

1187
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:38,855
I don't know. Do you think
that she planned this,

1188
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,624
or is this just a coincidence?

1189
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:43,493
- What does she want?
- She wants Mia.

1190
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:52,736
Who is it?

1191
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,638
It's Gabby.

1192
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,474
Grab Mia.

1193
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:01,111
Sweetie.

1194
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:02,712
Take her upstairs
and call the police.

1195
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,281
- Okay.
- And be quiet.

1196
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,649
Be safe.

1197
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:13,557
- Hello, Gabby.
- What are you doing here?

1198
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,725
I thought you guys
were divorced.

1199
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:16,826
We are.

1200
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:19,463
Oh, so you're just,
you're getting back together?

1201
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:21,231
That's sweet.

1202
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:23,867
Okay, sweetie, okay.

1203
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,636
I need you to be very quiet
for Mommy, okay?

1204
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,173
Don't say a word.
Can you do that for Mommy?

1205
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:32,609
Can I help you with something?

1206
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:33,910
I'm looking for Rachel.

1207
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,645
I needed to speak with her
about something.

1208
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,747
Unfortunately,
Rachel's not here right now.

1209
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:38,715
Oh, so you're just alone?

1210
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:41,151
You're just alone with Mia?

1211
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,954
Yes.

1212
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:47,857
Oh, okay, well, you know,
I could help you watch her.

1213
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:48,892
You know, you can do some work,

1214
01:08:48,925 --> 01:08:51,228
and I can watch her
while you wait for Rachel.

1215
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:52,462
No, that's good, that's good.

1216
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:54,531
Thank you though, Gabby.
Appreciate it.

1217
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,308
So who's that?

1218
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:07,477
Oh, that's just, uh...
That's Troy.

1219
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,446
You don't recognize him?

1220
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,547
I'm really sorry.

1221
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,849
He would get out of the car,
it's just he can't walk.

1222
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,288
You don't recognize him?
I mean, you nearly killed him.

1223
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:25,395
It's gonna be okay.

1224
01:09:25,429 --> 01:09:26,630
Yes, hi.

1225
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,499
Please send
the police immediately.

1226
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:31,201
Yeah, it's 4705.

1227
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:32,636
Yes, thank you.

1228
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,238
I don't understand.

1229
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:36,306
Drop the act.

1230
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,476
I mean, you told the police
it was an accident?

1231
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,245
Yeah, no, it was murder,

1232
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:43,847
and at the very least it was
vehicular manslaughter,

1233
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,251
but you got off,
because you're an attorney,

1234
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:51,788
on a ticket
for talking on the phone.

1235
01:09:54,258 --> 01:09:57,861
Yeah. Uh...
Do you remember that night?

1236
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:01,197
Do you remember the night
that you killed my child?

1237
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:08,938
Take it easy.

1238
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:10,640
Do you remember that?

1239
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,379
Gabby, I'm sincerely sorry
for your loss.

1240
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:18,282
My loss? My loss?

1241
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:20,317
My child is dead,
and my husband is a cripple,

1242
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,819
and I can't even have
another baby with him

1243
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,422
even if I wanted to.

1244
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,324
You call it a loss?
That's really amusing.

1245
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:29,926
I would call it a catastrophe
that destroyed my life.

1246
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,629
You're right, Gabby, I shouldn't
belittle your situation.

1247
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:34,364
You should've been there.

1248
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,899
You should've
taken accountability

1249
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:38,868
for what you did to my family.

1250
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,937
Gabby, the police told me
it was not my fault.

1251
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,572
It was your fault!
It was your fault!

1252
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:45,709
Gabby, Gabby, look at me.
It wasn't my fault.

1253
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,444
It was an accident.

1254
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,679
An accident? No.
There are no accidents.

1255
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:51,781
In life, these things,
they happen.

1256
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:53,417
God does not create accidents.

1257
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,385
Every time you get into a car,
you take that chance.

1258
01:10:55,419 --> 01:11:00,424
And how many people have you
prosecuted for accidents, huh?

1259
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,364
Gabby, get back in the car now!

1260
01:11:10,834 --> 01:11:12,902
Please just get in the car!

1261
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,439
Would you just get in the car
now, please?

1262
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:16,406
What are you doing?

1263
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,883
Troy, why are you leaving?

1264
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,631
See, that...

1265
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:43,800
was an accident.

1266
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,335
Rache...

1267
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:46,436
Rachel!

1268
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:49,473
Rachel.

1269
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,741
Rachel!

1270
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,445
Rachel!

1271
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:04,821
Rachel.

1272
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,416
Crystal!

1273
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:36,352
Mommy's home.

1274
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,469
- Mommy.
- Shh.

1275
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:54,370
Rachel!

1276
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,375
I'm here for my baby.

1277
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,479
You should just give her to me.

1278
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,048
That way I don't have
to hurt you.

1279
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,395
Rachel!

1280
01:13:32,509 --> 01:13:33,577
Hey!

1281
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,912
You hurt her, I will kill you!

1282
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,505
Rachel!

1283
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:25,962
Rachel!

1284
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:31,568
If you hurt her, I'll kill you!

1285
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,504
Sounds like it came
from around back. Let's go!

1286
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:55,659
Stop running.

1287
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:58,261
You're gonna hurt her!

1288
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:08,638
Where is she?

1289
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:11,007
Where is she?

1290
01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:22,986
Stop!

1291
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,057
Rachel!

1292
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:29,926
10-71, shots fired!

1293
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,668
She's not your child.

1294
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:40,670
Yes, she is.

1295
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:44,741
What do you think, this is
some sort of coincidence?

1296
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:46,309
God made this happen.

1297
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:49,178
This right here,
this is where fate meets!

1298
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,047
So where is my child?

1299
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:52,949
Rachel!

1300
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:58,955
Sir, are you okay?

1301
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,624
- Yeah.
- We got you.

1302
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:03,192
Think about what you're
doing here, Gabby.

1303
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,729
Think about it.
Why would God do this?

1304
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:08,031
Why would he take your baby
away from you

1305
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:11,334
so that could take my baby
away from me?

1306
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:13,336
It doesn't make sense.

1307
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:15,639
Life doesn't make sense!

1308
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:18,341
If it made sense,
I'd have your perfect life

1309
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:20,810
instead of
my pathetic existence!

1310
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:23,146
So this...
this is my chance!

1311
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:26,082
My chance of making it right!

1312
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:30,053
I'm so sorry
that you lost your baby.

1313
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,321
I am. I really am.

1314
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:35,024
My heart broke when
I heard you scream for her.

1315
01:16:39,796 --> 01:16:43,767
Did you know that I was pregnant
with Mia then?

1316
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,902
I was.
We almost lost her.

1317
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:49,138
I almost lost my baby too.

1318
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,722
Your baby lived.

1319
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:08,692
My baby died.

1320
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:13,697
I don't know why things
happen the way that they do.

1321
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,264
I-I...

1322
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,767
There's nothing that we can do
about it now, okay?

1323
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:19,368
Yeah, there is.

1324
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:21,004
Tell me where Crystal is!

1325
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:24,173
She's in heaven, Gabby.

1326
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:26,776
Maybe one day
you can be with her.

1327
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,846
Why would you say that?
You don't know that!

1328
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,748
Okay, you're right,
I don't know.

1329
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:33,249
I don't know if that's true.

1330
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:38,087
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if that were true?

1331
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,415
LAPD! Put the gun down!

1332
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:10,887
I think you're right.

1333
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,856
Put it down!

1334
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,724
I'm coming.

1335
01:18:20,864 --> 01:18:23,800
No! No!

1336
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:26,870
No!

1337
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:28,471
No!

1338
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,708
No!

1339
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:46,389
Daniel. Daniel.

1340
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:49,859
- Daniel?
- Hey.

1341
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:56,232
I told you you still love me.

1342
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:57,767
I still love you.

1343
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:03,206
Where's Mia?

1344
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,108
Mia.

1345
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,487
Sweetie!

1346
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:20,756
Mommy's here!
I'm right here!

1347
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,893
Mia, sweetie, Mommy's here.

1348
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:24,961
Mommy!

1349
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:26,863
Oh, sweet girl.

1350
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:28,297
Oh!

1351
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:30,466
I love you, Mommy.

1352
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:35,839
You did such a good job.
You did great.

1353
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:39,575
Mommy loves you.

1354
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,845
Okay, let's go see Daddy.

1355
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,226
Hey! Hey, there she is!

1356
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,228
- Mia!
- Our baby's okay.

1357
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:01,430
Oh, you did so good.

1358
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,066
I love you.

1359
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:08,137
Come on, get in the car.

1360
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:09,538
Rachel!

1361
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:11,975
You took everything from me!

1362
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:13,409
Everything!

1363
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,845

I think that
