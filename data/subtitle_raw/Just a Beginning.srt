1
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,073
Internet, TV, video games:

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,870
According to a
National Health Institute study

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,231
youths spend
five-and-a-half hours a day

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,038
in front of a screen:

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,591
The bombing horror goes on,

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,076
the toll approaching
a chilling 1,000 dead:

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,594
There was shoving and punching,

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,476
and what for?
To take 50 refugees:

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,796
JUST A BEGINNING

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,310
Perhaps due to
the Obama effect,

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,598
Sarkozy
is fast-tracking

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,870
the thorny issue
of diversity:

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,355
Faced with
the looming crisis,

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,596
inequality cannot
be tolerated:

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,153
As the president said,

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,198
that affects the basis
of social cohesion:

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,871
Liberty, yes,

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,596
equality, yes,

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,758
fraternity:
Question mark:

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,238
The aim is
to put some sense

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,839
into the nonsense:

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,632
Faced with this
flood of images,

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,669
I think we have to stay a bit angry,

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,792
because looking at TV,
there's good reason:

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,190
The debate on
schooling children

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,958
aged
two and three

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,309
has been
relaunched

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,078
by the Ministry
of Education:

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,914
In front of the Senate
finance committee

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,790
on July 3,
here's what Xavier Darcos said:

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,197
Is it really logical,

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,960
when we are so attentive over
the good use

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,509
of state funding,

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,517
to make people
attain a masters degree

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,154
when their job
is mainly giving kids a siesta

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,635
and changing
their nappies:

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,477
I wonder:?

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,035
WITH THE CHILDREN
OF THE JACQUES PREVERT KINDERGARTEN

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,595
HEADMIS TRESS

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,112
TEACHER

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,638
Now then, me, when I close my eyes,

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,593
there's something in my head:

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,916
I can't see anything at all:

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,389
Me:

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,279
yum, yum, yum!

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,950
I see something delicious:

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,835
What about you?

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,759
And you? And you?

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,876
What's in your head?

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,118
What's in your head?

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,232
- I've got a brain:
- A brain: Very good:

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,836
What have you got
in your head, Inès?

53
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,594
A memory:

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,869
You've got a memory:

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,588
Abdheramène?

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,518
- In my head:
- Yes?

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,517
- There's papa:
- Papa's in your head:

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,233
I've got papa and mama:

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,317
Watch carefully: IsmaeI:

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,953
That's magic chalk:

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,037
It's not magic chalk:

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,992
That is an object:

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,510
What's it called? A candle, Hamet:

64
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,919
The candle is going to help us
try and answer the questions

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,190
we're asking ourselves this morning:

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,509
It's moving!

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,709
Are you ready?

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,069
Shall we light it?

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,869
That means we're going to try

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,590
and answer the questions:

71
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,234
That's it: It's starting:

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,190
- It's not a birthday:
- No, it's not a birthday candle:

73
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,635
It's a candle to help us think,

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,717
not a candle for a birthday:

75
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,875
It helps me think:

76
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,159
It's helping you think?

77
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,033
When I ask you to do some work

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,353
you need to do something
in your head:

79
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,430
We need to?

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,518
- Make our memory work:
- Make our memory work:

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,679
Make all that work up there:
That's got a name:

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,429
We call that? You have to:?

83
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,757
- Think:
- To think:

84
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,633
We certainly need to do that;
to think:

85
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,951
When you think,

86
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,954
when you think with your head,

87
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,355
can anyone see you're thinking?

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,869
- Can you see it?
- No:

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,390
How do I know
what you're thinking?

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,079
You must open your mouth:

91
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,430
Open your mouth to do what?

92
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,316
To, to let it out:

93
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,358
To let it out:
And to let something out,

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,828
we have to:?

95
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,989
- To? You said it:
- To speak:

96
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,839
- And to eat:
- You also use the mouth to eat:

97
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,032
- And hands are for taking:
- You're right:

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,470
Mustn't speak with your mouth full:

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,158
There was a lot of anticipation,

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,794
even from the parents,
I can tell you:

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,871
Coming out, they all said:

102
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,156
"How was it? What was it about?"

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,237
Some said what they thought:

104
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,040
- Others can't have expected it:
- Did they say that?

105
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,278
I couldn't hear the kids well

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,234
because the parents chimed in with:
"Tell me all about it:"

107
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,115
They're curious to know
what happened, what was said:

108
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,070
What about you?

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,515
It was great: Jonathan said:

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,188
and I think it was the best moment,

111
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,430
Jonathan was making out that,
you know,

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,875
"I'm not interested:"

113
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,991
And then at one point I said:

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,236
Can anyone see when you think?

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,792
All together, they said no:

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,879
So I said: Then how can you show
what you're thinking about?

117
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,390
How can I see, Jonathan,
what you're thinking about?

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,319
He said, I can't remember
exactly how:

119
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,590
"You have to let it out:"

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,836
Like that: "You have to let it out:"

121
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,396
That was great,
because he'd said something earlier

122
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,592
as if he'd really worked out the path

123
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,995
that goes down as far as the mouth:

124
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,919
Then Yanis said:
"You have to speak:

125
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,793
"Letting it out is words:
You have to speak:"

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,155
Did she bring coffee?

127
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,636
Coffee? There isn't any coffee?

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,592
There's none left:

129
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,392
There was just a drop:

130
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,352
I want some coffee:

131
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,039
Never mind:

132
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
- What time is it?
- I think it's time to go in:

133
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,749
Let's go, back inside!

134
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,239
This morning

135
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,874
we're going to do philosophy:

136
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,918
What does that mean,
doing philosophy

137
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,357
with you? What does it mean?

138
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,630
- Talking:
- We're going to talk, good:

139
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,398
What else? Yanis?

140
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,160
- Use our brains:
- Use our brains: What else?

141
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,952
- Thinking:
- Thinking:

142
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,149
So,

143
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,195
I now declare

144
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,715
the philosophy

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,597
session

146
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,994
open:

147
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,518
So tell me,

148
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,075
are you adults or are you children?

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,396
- Children!
- Why do you say that?

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,431
Because I'm little:

151
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,591
My parents are big:

152
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,557
Little ones do work, grown-ups too:

153
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,149
Little ones do work
and grown-ups too:

154
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,072
I can do some things:

155
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,153
- What things?
- I can do my posters:

156
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,911
Can papa or mama,

157
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,232
or the teacher do things

158
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,994
that you can't manage to do?

159
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,239
He can do photos:

160
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,078
Who can do photos?

161
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,919
- Papa and mama:
- And you can't do photos?

162
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,314
Why not?

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,798
Because I'm not big enough:

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,353
Because what?

165
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,154
- Cos they're big:
- Because they are big:

166
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,679
Listen carefully, GabrieI, listen:

167
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,029
Is there anything

168
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,709
that you cannot do now

169
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,593
but you'll be allowed to do later?

170
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,279
- Yes:
- Everything:

171
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,756
Are there things,
Abderahmène, Matthis,

172
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,875
that you can't do now,

173
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,119
but that you'll be allowed
to do later? Anissa?

174
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,477
Rosemay, what d'you think?
Is there anything you can't do

175
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,915
that you'll be able to do later?

176
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,156
William, anything to say?

177
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,589
Naomy?

178
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,358
Well there, nothing!
And when I say nothing:

179
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,193
It was very unsettling
because it was dragging,

180
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,153
because I was getting nothing:
At all:

181
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,114
I was waiting, thinking;
"something has to emerge":

182
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,590
But it was just blanks,
nothing at all:

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,833
Because they didn't have
anything to say:

184
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,316
I've got tiny little feet:

185
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,714
It doesn't matter:

186
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,070
You can do it: Come on!

187
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,679
I'm the princess!

188
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,915
Come on!

189
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,434
Hurry up:

190
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,351
We've got tiny little feet:

191
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,955
Kyria, can you lend me the shoes?

192
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,311
I'm barefoot, because on the carpet,
we go barefoot:

193
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,756
I'm the most beautifuI:

194
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,910
We are beautifuI princesses:

195
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,112
Oh yes, I'd love to have a prince:

196
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,151
Don't write;

197
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,153
draw what you're thinking
in your head:

198
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,155
I think I want to marry my love,

199
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,392
I want to marry even though
I'm little, that it?

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,030
Good: Want to say anything else?

201
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,309
Go on, I'm listening:

202
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,592
Because I,
because my papa and mama,

203
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,395
they're not married,
I want to get married for them:

204
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,751
Can I say her name?

205
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,871
- Yes:
- She's called Laura:

206
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,398
Thank you, Yanis:

207
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,197
What did you think about, Shana?

208
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,270
- Little princesses:
- Why's that?

209
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,758
Because I like little princesses
who are kind:

210
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,352
And that's Azouaou:

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,314
Why did you think
of drawing Azouaou?

212
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,709
I don't know:

213
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,275
I don't need any help, it's fine:

214
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,993
She thought of you:

215
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,510
She was thinking of you
and so she drew you:

216
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,439
I'd like to know why
she thought of you:

217
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,348
Because I'm not her sweetheart
anymore:

218
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,596
And yet she draws me:

219
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,310
He was your sweetheart?

220
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,593
And you don't want that?

221
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,870
I'm not your sweetheart anymore!

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,031
Stop it, Azouaou!

223
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,593
Why were you thinking of Azouaou?
Was it for all those reasons?

224
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,956
Was it because you like him?
That it?

225
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,073
You're allowed to:
You're allowed to like him:

226
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,398
No matter if he doesn't think
the same as you:

227
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,875
You're allowed
to think differently:

228
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,790
When we see the drawings,
we'll see if we all think the same:

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,197
But you drew very well what
you were thinking:

230
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,030
- There's a lion:
- A lion? Oh, yes:

231
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,955
Yesterday, I was watching
Nicolas Sarkozy at home,

232
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,112
and my mama said to my papa

233
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,594
that he was in prison:

234
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,791
Sarkozy in prison?
That's news to me:

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,399
I want to say something:

236
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,750
What did he do then, this man?

237
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,679
- Yes, Anissa:
- I saw Sarkozy at my place too:

238
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,394
- He came to your house?
- Er:yes:

239
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,756
Nicolas Sarkozy came to your house?

240
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,075
- Yes:
- Really?

241
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,872
- I want to speak:
- Naomy?

242
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,992
He's our colleague,
of papa, of mama, of my brother:

243
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,031
He's a colleague
of papa and mama?

244
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,309
Yes, of ours:

245
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,517
WHAT IS A LEADER?

246
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,676
He's on the news, Sarkozy:

247
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,315
Yesterday he watched my papa,

248
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,159
and after, after,

249
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,037
and after on the balcony at home,
I watched, a big limousine:

250
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,629
He had a big limousine?

251
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,836
And what does he do, this man?

252
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,869
For the money:

253
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,275
- For the money?
- Yes:

254
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,191
Take it easy, get in line:

255
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,238
I'm going to ask you a question:
What is a leader?

256
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,153
A leader?

257
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,955
At schooI, are there any leaders?

258
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,235
- No:
- No:

259
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,510
Leader, that goes like that:

260
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,639
- Where do they do that?
- In the green thing:

261
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,193
What's the green thing?

262
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,231
- It's the soldiers:
- It's the soldiers:

263
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,599
So then, are soldiers leaders?

264
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,480
Soldiers are not leaders:

265
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,475
Would anyone here
like to be a leader?

266
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,910
- Yes:
- You'd like to be leaders?

267
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,792
- Who wants to be a leader?
- Me!

268
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,711
When I'm big, after I want to marry,

269
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,796
I want to put on my suit myself,

270
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,153
I want to buy a Twingo with myself,

271
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,715
after, after:

272
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,474
In my Twingo:

273
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,072
That's all very interesting:

274
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,159
In my Twingo,
I'm going to take Matthis for a ride:

275
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,437
You're going to take Matthis?

276
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,870
Will you be a leader
when you're big?

277
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,548
No, I'll have a leader, a leader:

278
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,358
You'll be a leader? Why?

279
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,313
Because she says like that,
my mama:

280
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,914
Does anyone want to be

281
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,951
the President of the Republic?

282
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,428
GabrieI?

283
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,068
Go on, GabrieI:

284
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,914
- Don't know what to do:
- You don't know how?

285
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,593
Kyria, would you like to?

286
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,793
What should we do?

287
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,674
The same thing? So then, here we go:

288
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,359
They know why they're doing it,
what's expected,

289
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,391
but they maybe don't know how:

290
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,916
- To express it:
- To explain it:

291
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,750
Whereas kids
who haven't done much philosophy,

292
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,394
when you ask them
they've maybe got more:

293
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,795
When I somersault it hurts my butt:

294
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,391
We don't do somersaults in the yard,
we do them on gym mats:

295
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,754
So they're more neutraI,

296
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,235
so they're forced to really think:

297
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,557
While these ones
are already thinking about things,

298
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,830
why ask the question? You see?

299
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,031
- Maybe that's it:
- Yes, that's it:

300
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,674
Yes, Florian:

301
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,119
He doesn't want to lend them:

302
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,158
Let him play with it a bit:

303
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,875
From the start, when you said
they're doing philosophy:

304
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,958
What use is it?
For thinking:

305
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,991
But I wanted us to go further:

306
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,070
- "A" first:
- The "A" first:

307
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,391
Good, nice and pointy, great:

308
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,078
- After?
- The "B":

309
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,757
There, you've drawn a verticaI line:

310
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,190
Good:

311
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,748
Good, keep going, the:

312
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,957
- Very good:

313
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,472
Good: Not bad at all:

314
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,711
"A, B, D", after it's the:

315
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,512
- No, no: Look:

316
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,550
"E":

317
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,068
- Good: After, what letter is it?
- The "H":

318
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,634
"H", very good:

319
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,878
After, what letter is that?

320
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,158
- Like Naomy:
- Yes, like Naomy:

321
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,997
You're right:

322
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,316
- Which one like Naomy?
- "N":

323
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,714
- It's the:?

324
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,239
- The?
- "N":

325
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,954
"N", good! I didn't hear you:

326
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,595
Good: And now I can read it:

327
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,235
ABDERAHMENE:

328
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,352
D'you see what you've done?

329
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,788
Are you pleased?

330
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,036
Do you recognise your name?

331
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,919
Great: Put your things away:

332
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,514
I don't see any danger,
we can carry on:

333
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,271
Let's hide in a corner,
I saw something move

334
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,429
It's no time for playing around:
Let's go closer:

335
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,117
WHAT IS A FRIEND?

336
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,356
Azouaou and Theo are friends:

337
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,872
How did you tell
that they were friends?

338
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,798
Cos sometimes they hold hands:

339
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,629
And then I hold hands
with someone else:

340
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,993
And do you have friends?

341
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,872
Who are your friends?

342
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,516
My friends are: IsmaeI, Kyria,

343
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,953
GabrieI, Azouaou and Naomy:

344
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,070
I like Kyria:

345
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,313
Do we like friends
the same as sweethearts?

346
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,511
- No!
- Yes!

347
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,279
I can't hear a thing:

348
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,799
Friends, you play

349
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,519
with them,

350
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,359
and sweethearts kiss each other:

351
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,949
On the mouth: Then get married:

352
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,469
They get married?

353
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,750
Do you kiss your friends?

354
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,474
Yes, on the cheek,
you can kiss them:

355
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,871
Yanis, he said on the cheek:

356
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,799
- And sweethearts not the cheek?
- On the mouth:

357
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,153
What do you think?

358
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,192
- Miss:
- Myron?

359
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,152
I want to give mama a big kiss:

360
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,316
- Are you her sweetheart?
- Yes:

361
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,239
- Really? She doesn't have another?
- No:

362
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,037
Can Myron
be his mama's sweetheart?

363
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,992
Kyria said I'm her sweetheart:

364
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,919
Can a mama be a friend, a mama?

365
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,270
- No:
- Why not?

366
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,556
Mama kisses me on the mouth:

367
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,194
- So are you her sweetheart?
- Course not:

368
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,119
She's already got one; papa:

369
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,388
Can friends get cross
with each other?

370
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,709
I agree:

371
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,157
No, he doesn't agree:

372
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,360
Can friends get cross
with each other?

373
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,516
Can they argue?

374
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,472
- Yes:
- Yes or no?

375
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,240
- Yes!
- Wait, let Abderahmène explain:

376
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,635
You know, last time with William,

377
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,910
I had an argument with him:

378
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,752
- You stayed cross with him?
- No:

379
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,833
- I want to say something:
- Yes, Yanis:

380
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,350
Well, my papa, well,
he no longer speaks to

381
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,273
a friend of his:

382
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,914
Can you stay cross long
with a friend?

383
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,031
My papa, he, he speaks to him,

384
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,919
he speaks to him now:

385
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,874
My papa has a friend,
he's called Kadour:

386
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,511
And why is he papa's friend?

387
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,712
Because yesterday,
the police caught him:

388
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,273
What did Kadour do?

389
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,517
Because: he didn't have
a driving license:

390
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,951
So? Since they were friends,
what happened?

391
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,195
Did anything happen?

392
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,359
He went to Algeria alone:
He didn't have a ticket:

393
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,110
What did papa and Kadour do?

394
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,548
Papa has a license
because he's nice:

395
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,398
He still speaks to him:

396
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,875
He still goes to his house:

397
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,795
Can brothers and sisters be friends?

398
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,434
Can you be friends
with your siblings?

399
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,552
Rosemay, what do you think?

400
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,233
Are you friends
with your sister Manon?

401
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,793
Is she your friend, Manon?

402
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,274
Why not?

403
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,839
Why not?

404
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,992
Let's play fighting:

405
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,389
I'm not playing:

406
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,797
Sherazade, is Halima your friend?

407
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,312
I'll tell you a secret:

408
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,559
Leave Yanis alone:

409
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,069
Halima, is Sherazade your friend?

410
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,790
Is she your friend or your sister?

411
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,910
She's my sister:

412
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,475
Is she your friend too? Why not?

413
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,113
What did you say?

414
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,437
Yanis listen,
she says she's her sister,

415
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,634
she says she's not her friend: Why?

416
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,315
Have you only got boys for friends?

417
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,589
There's no room:

418
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,031
Can girls be friends?

419
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,116
Abderahmène is a bit squashed in:

420
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,514
Yes or no?

421
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,995
Do you know?

422
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,991
I'm going to get cross:

423
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,872
Hello, mama?:
It's me, I'm at schooI:

424
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,959
We're playing:

425
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,191
See you later, mama, bye-bye:

426
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,597
I'd like to see mama, for reaI:
I'm not kidding:

427
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,990
Yanis, off you go, mama's here:

428
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,474
Jonathan:

429
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,555
Bye-bye:

430
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,397
Inès; since I don't see you often,
I forget:

431
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,113
Inès, off you go:

432
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,551
Bye-bye: Anissa:

433
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,950
We coloured-in a fir tree,

434
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,714
and the older ones,
they coloured a Father Christmas:

435
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,470
Is that all you did in a day?

436
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,713
NO BATHING, WALKING
OR SKATING ON THE ICE

437
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,392
How come you can see
my hand on the screen?

438
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,591
Because there's the light:

439
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,633
- Because what, Naomy?
- Because the light:

440
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,432
What about it, the light?

441
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,712
- Well, your hand:
- What about my hand?

442
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,071
Look what happens
if Théo stands up:

443
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,508
What happens?

444
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,990
- We see his head:
- Why is that?

445
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,434
Is that it?

446
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,708
Will it light? Yes:

447
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,311
Being intelligent,
what does that mean?

448
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,514
Mama is intelligent:

449
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,472
Why is mama intelligent?

450
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,036
Because she never puts the Nutella
in the fridge:

451
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,310
Because she never puts the Nutella
in the fridge?

452
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,158
- Intelligent means:
- Yanis?

453
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,078
Sit round properly please:

454
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,714
It's better to draw
than play video games,

455
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,478
otherwise you're stupid:

456
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,794
Is it true, when you play
video games you're stupid?

457
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,195
- Do you think:
- You learn nothing:

458
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,513
Also Hélène,
she doesn't stop playing the star:

459
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,550
The star?

460
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,515
Why are you talking about that,
given today's question?

461
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,435
Because she thinks she's beautifuI
with her pink coat:

462
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,710
What's that to do with intelligence?

463
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,916
Well, Madonna sings well:

464
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,439
My brother said to me:
When you act the star

465
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,198
you're not intelligent:

466
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,914
When you act the star,
well you act the bighead:

467
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,993
You might think you're a star,

468
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,513
but no one cares
when you take yourself for a star:

469
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,390
Because sometimes I've seen in:

470
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,998
where they sing, and it was a girI,

471
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,869
and she got undressed
and you saw her all naked:

472
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,429
Is that intelligent or not?
Why not?

473
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,469
Are adults more intelligent
than kids?

474
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,477
No, because they say:

475
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,556
"You know nothing,
you know nothing:"

476
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,318
We know some things:

477
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,954
Are adults smarter than kids or not?

478
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,232
- My papa is less intelligent:
- Why d'you say that?

479
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,192
Because he didn't know

480
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,998
that Nutella doesn't go

481
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,160
in the fridge,
it goes in the cupboard:

482
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,717
He puts the Nutella in the fridge
so he's not smart?

483
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,876
- It melts:
- It gets cold:

484
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,039
What could he do now
to become intelligent?

485
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,036
I know what he could do
to be intelligent:

486
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,718
We just have to ask someone

487
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,352
to find a solution for the Nutella:

488
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,790
- Does anyone have a solution?
- Me:

489
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,878
- Kyria, you have one?
- In the kitchen cupboard:

490
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,508
Kyria has found a solution:

491
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,552
Do we stop thinking
when the candle goes out?

492
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,230
No, we think about other things:

493
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,679
WHAT IS FEAR?
Why are those characters not afraid?

494
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,273
Cos they're superheroes:

495
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,918
Nightmares can be a little bit
too scary, but not dreams:

496
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,958
Do you remember this?

497
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,390
- It's a question mark:
- A question mark:

498
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,631
Does he think or reflect, Santa?

499
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,556
Myron, when we think about a thing,
can we have it right away?

500
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,117
Théo,

501
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,558
can we stop thinking?

502
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,477
Yes:

503
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,875
We stop?
Does that ever happen?

504
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,355
- Do we learn by thinking?
- Yes:

505
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,276
You agree?

506
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,550
We learn about God when we think:

507
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,919
Do you like thinking or not,
Abderahmène?

508
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,031
When I used to do philosophy,

509
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,591
I always used to ask myself why

510
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,711
we lit the candle in the afternoon:

511
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,114
It's a good question:

512
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,630
Let's begin, the candle is lit:

513
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,554
To have a sweetheart,
you have to flirt:

514
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,309
I don't like schooI:

515
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,637
Boys and girls are the same,
because:

516
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,192
They're the same because:

517
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,512
They want to make love:

518
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,876
They want to make love? Meaning?

519
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,673
You're asking
more and more questions,

520
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,917
and you need to think even deeper:

521
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,472
We should just do the class
and we'll see if we're able to think:

522
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,909
What is death?

523
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,320
There are countries that are dead:

524
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,750
What are you talking about?

525
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,118
It's cos of the newspaper:

526
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,550
The paper always talks about death:

527
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,830
Why do they always talk about it?

528
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,112
They say things that are not good:

529
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,478
On TV,

530
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,553
when the news: we see fires:

531
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,513
The TV, the TV is hot:

532
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,472
Why do you say that?

533
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,796
Because when I see,

534
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,518
when I touch the TV,
it's already hot:

535
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,916
There was the news,

536
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,512
there was a car,
it went where there was a train,

537
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,191
there was the bus,
and after it made an accident:

538
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,352
There's someone
who killed something

539
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,553
in the residence just next door:

540
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,273
What did he kill? Myron!

541
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,869
Where there's the nursery schooI:

542
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,990
Who killed what?

543
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,393
There was a guy with a pistoI,

544
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,997
and do you know what he did?
He fired:

545
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,475
Really? Then what happened?

546
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,878
Then they started a fire,
the firefighters came

547
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,838
and the police too,
and the hospitaI:

548
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,514
I'm not very happy when people die:

549
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,278
Why are you not happy?

550
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,515
Because I don't want

551
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,317
my mama to be dead:

552
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,670
I don't want my granddad to be dead,

553
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,836
or my other granddad to be dead,

554
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,316
and not my grandma to be dead,
or my other grandma to be dead

555
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,876
and I don't want my cousin
to be dead

556
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,479
and my other cousin:

557
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,238
Why don't you want that?

558
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,628
You've got it all:

559
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,558
Because I don't want to be alone,
because then I'll get lost:

560
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,398
We were talking about
the man who died:

561
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,871
- What can you tell us?
- He was little before,

562
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,753
then he grew, he was four years old:

563
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,872
Then he was big, he was like that:

564
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,718
10 years old?

565
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,876
Then he was

566
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,596
very, very, very old,

567
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,439
and then he died:

568
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,392
Gently, gently:

569
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,595
Just like the big boys, my God:

570
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,075
Come on, come and see, Abde:

571
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,879
Bring the bike, we're off:

572
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,158
Stop cycling, we're going home:

573
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,350
They say they don't have any choice,

574
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,870
but to hear their story,
we had to film with hidden cameras:

575
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,157
The supermarket trash cans
have just been put out

576
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,876
and 5 people
are already upon them:

577
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,150
Their kids get food from the trash:

578
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,318
What's written?

579
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,349
"A":

580
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,236
There's "A", there's "B",

581
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,158
there's "D" and there's "E",

582
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,634
there's "R",

583
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,950
there's "A", there's "H",

584
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,310
there's "M", there's "E",

585
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,959
there's "N" and there's "E":

586
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,276
ABDERAHMENE:

587
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,477
To go up into junior class,

588
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,358
to go into junior:

589
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,597
No: Passing into junior class:

590
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,552
Come in, hello:
Take a seat, let's begin:

591
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,910
Come along, sit closer,

592
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,792
let's make a little room:

593
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,231
Come here, my love, closer:

594
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,152
Hello, thank you:

595
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,072
I'm losing my notes:

596
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,189
First off, thank you for coming
this morning:

597
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,674
It's a pleasure working
with your kids:

598
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,957
At the start, it's a lot of effort
for the teacher:

599
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,594
Then the more we move forward,

600
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,678
the more the sessions
are driven by the kids,

601
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,553
and now I take much more
of a back seat,

602
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,194
listening to what they have to say:

603
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,876
The program won't be stopping,

604
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,275
I'm pleased to say
it's being renewed next year:

605
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,074
That's where
I'd really like to thank you,

606
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,477
because without your kids,
there would be no program:

607
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,750
It's through the children

608
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,713
that the philosophy program
can grow:

609
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,117
And it wouldn't happen
without the families either,

610
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,074
since we ask you
put a huge amount of faith in us,

611
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,392
and a huge amount
of faith in your kids' words,

612
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,472
because they say many things
you can't controI:

613
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,998
Thank you very much:
I'm quite moved:

614
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,997
We thank you too,
because without this,

615
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,350
we couldn't have continued at home:

616
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,518
There were some very important,
interesting themes,

617
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,315
notably death, which we didn't
quite know how to broach,

618
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,115
and bringing that home,
talking about it with the kids,

619
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,357
that helped us as parents
to discuss it with them:

620
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,075
It was a good follow-up
from schooI to home:

621
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,474
So, thank you:

622
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,120
"France is changing,
now when there is a strike,

623
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,639
no one notices: "

624
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,389
The words of N: Sarkozy today
at his party conference:

625
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,309
A circuit of more than 5 miles,
180 guys on bikes,

626
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,949
and thousands of spectators
on the way:

627
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,549
It's one of the biggest
sporting events,

628
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,988
the Tour de France:

629
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,556
The first stage started out
from Brest a half-hour ago:

630
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,316
The riders are on the road,
and the vacationers too:

631
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,274
Traffic authorities are bracing
for a very busy day:

632
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,629
"Do You Love Me Or Not?"

633
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,358
Do you know why
we're here again today?

634
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,431
We're going to do philosophy:

635
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,552
What does that mean,
doing philosophy, Inès?

636
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,156
We're thinking about things:

637
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,991
- Thinking:
- We're going to think:

638
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,719
- Listening:
- We'II listen:

639
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,072
- Asking ourselves questions:
- What do we ask about?

640
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,829
About love:

641
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,793
Today it's love,
but it's not always love:

642
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,035
Well?

643
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,997
- Sometimes we change topic:
- Sometimes we change:

644
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,113
We think, we ask questions

645
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,754
on the world around us,
in which we live:

646
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,193
So, today's question:

647
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,638
- Here it is:
- It's love:

648
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,679
What is love?

649
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,511
Love means that

650
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,678
the papas, after,
are in love with the mamas:

651
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,676
Love,

652
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,035
well,

653
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,476
it's something

654
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,072
that is good, but

655
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,399
people who are in love, well:

656
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,958
Inès, she says love
is something good;

657
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,159
do you agree with that?

658
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,513
- What d'you think?
- It's good:

659
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,278
So Shana, why's it good?

660
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,276
Because there are people
who are married

661
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,835
and afterwards they're happy:

662
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,148
It's not good to get married:

663
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,989
It's not good to get married:
Why's that, can you tell us?

664
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,988
Because, you don't have
to get married always:

665
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,395
- Why shouldn't you marry?
- Yes!

666
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,114
- No!
- Yes!

667
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,991
Stop talking: I'm speaking:

668
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,872
Go on, explain:

669
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,277
You shouldn't always
get married because

670
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,274
you should do it once,

671
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,995
and after, when you're not married
all the time,

672
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,508
you get married again:

673
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,753
The papa and the mama,

674
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,514
if they're married,
they'll fight with each other

675
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,756
to get the baby:

676
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,877
Then they'll fight,

677
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,436
and then the mama
will get angry and she'll say:

678
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,313
"Well then, I've changed my mind,

679
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,115
I'm moving out
and we're getting a divorce:"

680
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,272
You can't love
for a lifetime because

681
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,319
if they fight over the baby,

682
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,988
then they'll get divorced,

683
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,518
and it's the other one
who'll take the baby

684
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,118
and he'll chose another sweetheart:

685
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,033
A girI can be in love
and a boy is not in love:

686
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,070
Yes, that can be:

687
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,319
It's the girls that is in love
with another girI:

688
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,708
Are you nuts?

689
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,150
Why do you say that, Abderahmène?

690
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,679
Do you mean that girls are in love?

691
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,948
- Is that possible or not?
- Not possible:

692
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,953
It's not because if you're in love
with a girI, you can't marry:

693
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,630
You have to be in love
with a boy that you love:

694
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,270
You want him to be handsome,
but if he isn't you don't love him:

695
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,949
You have to fall in love with a boy:

696
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,990
You see?

697
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,713
It's the code:

698
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,918
Wait, wait, wait; what did you say?

699
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,879
- It's the code:
- What is this code?

700
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,399
Like the highway code:

701
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,797
Like the highway code?
So it's the code of what?

702
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,228
It's the code of love:

703
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,113
It's the code of love?

704
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,118
Can anyone tell me
what this code of love is?

705
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,309
Kyria?

706
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,200
I'm not in love with Abigaëlle,

707
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,955
I like Abigaëlle:

708
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,876
You're not in love with Abigaëlle,
but you like her:

709
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,878
Abigaëlle is a little girI, right?

710
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,152
She's using words
that are a little bit different:

711
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,873
She doesn't love Abigaëlle,

712
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,759
but she still likes her:
Explain us that:

713
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,310
Explain that to us:

714
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,877
Because a girI
can't be in love with another girI:

715
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,314
In what way do you like Abigaëlle?

716
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,636
- Have you got a sweetheart?
- Yes:

717
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,398
- Who's that?
- Yanis:

718
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,399
You don't like Abigaëlle
the same as Yanis?

719
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,839
Inside you,
how does it feeI liking Yanis?

720
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,917
She likes Yanis, that's all:

721
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,720
- Yanis likes me too:
- He likes you too:

722
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,275
It's him who gives me
the most kisses:

723
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,631
Oh, kisses again!
We haven't talked about that:

724
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,758
- She annoys me:
- Why does that annoy you?

725
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,234
Because:

726
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,399
She always looks at me:

727
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,190
- She comes next to me all the time:
- And that's all?

728
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,516
How do you show
when you're in love?

729
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,711
You do little tummy tickles:

730
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,509
- You turn red:
- Why do you go red?

731
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,553
Because you've got a heart
in the tummy:

732
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,229
Because we've got a heart
in our tummy:

733
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,917
Some old people don't love anymore:

734
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,554
A grandma and a grandpa:

735
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,039
Go on, my dear:

736
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,276
:They love each other,

737
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,997
and sometimes they don't:

738
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,197
Can grandpas and grandmas love?

739
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,396
- Can they be in love?
- No:

740
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,790
No?

741
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,950
Why not?

742
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,869
Because grandpas
and grandmas are old:

743
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,112
That means
they're still in love, Azouaou:

744
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,274
In Algeria,
I've got my grandma and grandpa:

745
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,519
I've been to see them often
with my papa and mama,

746
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,478
with my four-wheeI-drive:

747
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,878
Are grandpa and grandma
still in love?

748
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,069
No:

749
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,311
Because my grandpa and grandma

750
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,636
don't want to be in love:

751
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,598
I say that's not true:

752
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,638
I'm telling you it is:

753
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,755
If Azouaou says that's how it is,
then it's true:

754
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,439
Wait, wait!

755
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,353
Wait, hold on a minute:

756
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,758
I'm older than Shana
and I'm older than you:

757
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,955
Shana!

758
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,790
He's telling you that Azouaou's
grandma and grandpa are in Algeria:

759
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,671
So what?

760
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,711
So, you listen:

761
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,512
It's none of your business:

762
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,075
Listen to Azouaou:

763
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,429
Wait, wait:

764
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,519
- He went to see her:
- In the bled:

765
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,878
What's that, the blade?

766
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,796
The BLED:

767
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,877
The bled, sorry: What's that?

768
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,877
- The bled is Algeria:
- It's Algeria?

769
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,838
I agree with Shana,

770
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,076
but I don't agree with Azouaou,

771
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,319
because those two have to agree
since they're sweethearts:

772
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,956
They should say sorry for love:

773
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,838
They don't want to forgive:

774
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,196
If they don't say sorry, then,

775
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,794
they're not sweethearts:

776
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,195
but if they say sorry, they are:

777
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,834
If we don't say sorry,
we're not in love:

778
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,315
And we look for someone else:

779
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,752
Inès said

780
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,952
that if we forgive each other,
we can still love:

781
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,593
Do you think that's true?

782
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,393
Yes or no?

783
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,474
- Do you agree or not? What:
- I agree:

784
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,873
But since Shana
doesn't want to forgive me,

785
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,469
I'll shout at her in the yard:

786
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,476
Azouaou can give
a bouquet of flowers to Shana:

787
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,271
What are you on about, Kyria?

788
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,318
You're talking rubbish!

789
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,433
Shana? Are you going to forgive him?

790
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,111
Last time you told me:
"Will you still be my sweetheart?"

791
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,675
And now what do you say?

792
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,789
What? Little apple?

793
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,510
- I didn't do anything!
- Yes you did!

794
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,397
I didn't do anything!

795
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,836
- Yes!
- No!

796
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,599
I've got a good idea
for us to forgive:

797
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,951
I've got an idea:
Find a flower and give it to me:

798
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,758
No, he doesn't need to:

799
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,278
They're filming you:

800
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,351
He breathed in
and got it all up his nose:

801
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,913
How d'you make bubbles?

802
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,316
- With the straw:
- Yes, but how?

803
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,712
- He blows:
- Oh, he blows:

804
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,315
- Where does he blow?
- Like that:

805
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,433
He blows:

806
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,994
We've got objects
that float and sink,

807
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,998
we're going to see
why they float and sink:

808
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,237
There we saw just a stapler
and a little boat:

809
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,352
We're going to have
to look outdoors,

810
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,155
and amongst the objects
in schooI and in the home:

811
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,672
We have to find those that float,

812
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,677
and those that sink,

813
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,313
and find out why:

814
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,438
I LOVE YOU JOCELYNE

815
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,196
You know Abderahmène?
Well he said

816
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,398
there's no such thing
as girls who kiss girls:

817
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,639
Then I said: I like Abigaëlle,

818
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,751
but I'm not in love with her:

819
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,394
That's right, she's your friend:

820
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,955
She's your paI, but not your love:

821
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,718
Then Pascaline said:

822
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,829
"Who's your sweetheart?"
And everyone said: "Yanis!"

823
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,389
Do you love mama and papa
more than Yanis?

824
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,396
What?

825
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,479
Do you love us more than Yanis
or him more than us?

826
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,076
I love you more:

827
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,669
Is that so? Why's that?

828
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,598
Because you're nice:

829
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,392
And Yanis isn't nice?

830
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,034
Yes, he's a little bit nice:

831
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,758
He's very nice but before he hit me:

832
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,109
Really?

833
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,435
Yes:

834
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,910
That's not very nice:
Can a sweetheart hit his friend?

835
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,996
No:

836
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,789
My name is Alice

837
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,797
I've got my head in the clouds

838
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,914
A rabbit with a watch

839
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,118
Birds that speak and weep

840
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,711
I'm Alice in Wonderland

841
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,629
Alice, I'm afraid in my sleep

842
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,351
In nature or the sky:

843
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,433
It's true that Aimé Césaire is dead:

844
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,519
Aimé Césaire?

845
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,399
- Do you know him?
- She said Aimé Césaire:

846
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,950
Do you know who he is?
Césaire?

847
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,319
- He died in Martinique:
- Tell us who he was:

848
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,437
Mama told me:

849
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,557
Mama talked to you about him?

850
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,797
Aimé Césaire
who died in Martinique:

851
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,958
Because I saw the picture
when he was dead:

852
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,154
Death means,

853
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,199
for example, when there is a fish

854
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,638
and a boy sees the fish that is dead

855
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,796
he says to a papa:

856
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,228
"Papa,

857
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,348
"Leave it, it's sleeping:"

858
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,955
"No, Gaston, it's dead:"

859
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,595
Death, we're:

860
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,638
we're not allowed
to get ourselves killed:

861
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,155
If someone attacks us, we're dead

862
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,513
forever and the other one
goes to prison:

863
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,353
Someone who's dead

864
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,916
is someone
who doesn't breathe anymore,

865
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,951
who doesn't move anymore:

866
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,431
Their eyes are closed:

867
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,840
Even deceased people are dead:

868
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,833
Deceased and dead,
is it the same thing?

869
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,274
- Not the same:
- Deceased:

870
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,038
- No:

871
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,634
Deceased:

872
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,235
What does that mean, being deceased?

873
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,873
Who wants to explain?

874
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,310
N'Dickou, what does it mean?

875
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,150
Someone who's deceased,
he's dead in a coffin:

876
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,477
Is it the same thing or not,
deceased and dead?

877
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,996
Is being dead and deceased the same?

878
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,794
It's not the same, it's just that

879
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,355
when you're deceased,
you're in a coffin,

880
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,916
but when you're dead,
you're not in a coffin:

881
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,354
It's the same:

882
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,508
Yes, it's the same:

883
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,715
It's the same:

884
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,957
What about a coffin,
what's that for?

885
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,918
You don't go in the grave,

886
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,317
first they put the person
in the coffin, and then

887
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,080
they put the coffin in the grave:

888
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,956
If someone is dead
you can still give gifts:

889
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,037
Gifts on the grave:

890
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,593
Well, that's different:

891
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,916
I don't agree with Shana because

892
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,958
when you put gifts on a grave, well,

893
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,948
you're dead forever,
you're dead under the ground,

894
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,110
forever:

895
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,312
Gifts to put on graves,
what are they for?

896
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,278
- Nothing:
- For praying:

897
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,636
Praying, tell us what you mean:

898
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,355
Shana, you must learn to listen too:

899
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,239
It's not for anything:

900
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,189
It's nothing, it's just decoration:

901
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,630
You have to decorate with flowers:

902
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,512
What are the flowers for?

903
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,355
Sometimes they take necklaces
and bracelets to pray:

904
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,630
To pray: What's that, then?

905
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,191
Praying is for speaking to God,
and so God,

906
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,915
he raises up people

907
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,157
who we want to be still on earth:

908
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,669
You mean he brings them
back on earth?

909
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,393
On earth, she said:

910
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,830
When we die, we're buried,

911
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,110
and after we go to

912
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,797
the paradise of our God:

913
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,513
When you die it means

914
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,514
it's for a long time
and then you go to heaven:

915
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,988
Because in heaven

916
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,597
there's the Virgin Mary:

917
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,749
- Who's that?
- Yes, she's flying:

918
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,350
- She's a goddess:
- She's a goddess:

919
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,275
In heaven there's the Virgin Mary
and Father Christmas:

920
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,038
And then you are an angeI:

921
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,748
Our souI goes to God, not our skin:

922
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,595
It's our souI:

923
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,279
What's that, our souI?

924
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,880
It's an invisible thing that's blue:

925
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,595
- It's invisible?
- And it comes out of our tummy:

926
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,234
I'll ask you a question,
listen carefully:

927
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,755
When you learn that someone's dead,

928
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,234
how do you feeI

929
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,835
in your body
and in your head?

930
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,669
When someone dies, it's maybe
someone's grandpa, mother,

931
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,592
or their father:

932
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,879
We're sad because it's our mother

933
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,753
or our father:

934
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,511
And then, next,

935
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,872
it hurts us in our own hearts:

936
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,068
- What if your mama died?
- I'd kill myself:

937
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,278
D'you agree with him?

938
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,790
He says that if his mama died,
he'd kill himself:

939
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,793
What do you think of that?

940
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,554
Hold on, he'll explain:

941
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,274
I'd like to see
what it's like to be dead,

942
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,710
the problem is you can't get up:

943
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,390
Then, his papa will be alone:

944
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,716
He'll stay
with the 2 little sisters:

945
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,714
But he'll think of you,
he'll miss you:

946
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,757
I don't agree with Yanis,

947
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,191
if his mama kills herself,
and he kills himself,

948
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,791
we won't be able
to learn anything more

949
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,470
with the passing of life:

950
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,877
You won't be able
to learn more about passing life:

951
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,032
But I see with my eyes:

952
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,232
- But if you're dead:
- My souI goes to heaven:

953
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,317
If you're dead you see nothing:

954
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,071
Yes I will, but my souI will go
with God and I'll see like God:

955
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,395
No, you won't:

956
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,517
Cos your eyes will be closed:

957
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,631
You can die with your eyes open:

958
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,916
Yes, but you still can't see:

959
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,634
I don't agree with Yanis:

960
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,236
If his mama died
and he was going to kill himself too,

961
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,074
afterwards he'd be dead forever:

962
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,432
I'd rather his mama died
and that he stayed with his father:

963
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,599
He'd stay with his father,
you hear that?

964
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,677
That way his mama's in his heart

965
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,872
and he can always
think of his mother:

966
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,951
That's it, they're capable

967
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,432
of staying with the topic,

968
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,468
bouncing it around
even with the other kids' comments,

969
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,033
reacting,
knowing if they agree or not,

970
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,435
and building an argument,

971
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,232
so some kids can do it:

972
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,750
There's lots going on
with the parents,

973
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,712
kids are saying to me:

974
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,718
"I talked about that
with mama in the car,"

975
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,036
"I talked about:"

976
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,109
So I think the parents understand
they're also involved here

977
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,150
and it's important:

978
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,990
It'll also help them to answer
questions they are asked at home:

979
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,197
I think some parents
prepare for it long in advance:

980
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,437
You can see it
in the more considered views:

981
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,752
- I said it's just the teachers:
- OK, just teachers:

982
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,953
But when teachers scold their kids
at home, cos teachers are mamas,

983
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,230
does it mean they don't love them?

984
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,795
I don't want to be filmed dying:

985
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,718
What d'you do? Can't remember?

986
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,595
- What?
- I said we talked about love:

987
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,679
I'm just asking: I'd like to know
why you got told off:

988
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,829
Whose it not going well with?
Teachers? Supervisors? Parents?

989
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,918
When grandpas scold you,
do they love you?

990
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,118
Aunts and uncles?
Doesn't Aunty love you?

991
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,153
No, I didn't say
my aunts and uncles,

992
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,475
Just the teachers:

993
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,673
You didn't answer me:

994
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,314
Teachers don't have to love the kids:

995
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,078
When you're told off,
they don't love you?

996
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,429
Next year, what are you going to do
if you're told off?

997
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,559
Next year's one is strict:

998
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,228
- I'll put up with it:
- You'll put up?

999
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,072
Unless they beat me:

1000
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,032
What d'you want to do
in philosophy next week?

1001
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,313
What topic? What do you
want to talk about?

1002
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,392
What topic would you like?

1003
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,949
What use are mamas and papas?

1004
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,750
They only seem to watch TV:

1005
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,559
What use are you, then?

1006
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,952
- That's it, what use are kids?
- Me, playing or drawing:

1007
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,118
No, but for me:
What use are you to me?

1008
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,029
- I can't hear:
- For playing Lego Batman:

1009
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,229
I'm there so you can play:
But what use are you? Nothing:

1010
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,919
Wipe your mouth:

1011
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,877
- What use are you?
- What use is having kids?

1012
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,399
They don't make you happy:

1013
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,511
Don't make you happy? Why?

1014
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,109
Cos you're always telling us off:

1015
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,479
The next train for Melun
is currently at Cesson station:

1016
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,117
It will pull into platform 1 B:
Departure scheduled for 11:09:

1017
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,276
Thank you for your attention:

1018
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,430
Difference means that

1019
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,832
sometimes it's old people:

1020
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,634
It's handicapped people,

1021
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,515
things that are different,
animals are not like us too:

1022
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,036
For example, elephants;

1023
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,958
they've got four feet:

1024
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,799
And humans have got:

1025
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,234
They've got 2 feet:

1026
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,634
They've got 4 feet,

1027
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,230
their legs, they've two of them,

1028
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,113
and the front ones, they're hands:

1029
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,394
- I don't agree with Yanis:
- Why not?

1030
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,719
I think Yanis is talking nonsense cos

1031
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,315
he thinks he's seen some films:

1032
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,277
It's not about films,
we're trying to see if animals

1033
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,589
are people like us:

1034
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,439
We're the same, except different,

1035
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,108
because they've got
blood like us, but

1036
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,753
we're the same as them

1037
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,673
except they're not the same:
It's both:

1038
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,673
Animals are more hairy

1039
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,594
than parents:

1040
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,153
More hairy than parents:

1041
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,635
Sometimes, the difference is also:

1042
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,558
- No, it's:
- Shut up!

1043
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,556
Go on:

1044
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,751
The difference is women and boys:

1045
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,030
The difference is women and boys:

1046
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,879
Sometimes boys

1047
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,034
have got long hair, sometimes boys:

1048
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,869
There are boys with long hair

1049
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,394
like girls:

1050
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,398
For example, Florent,
but it doesn't mean

1051
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,553
that he's a girI
because he's got hair:

1052
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,757
It's because it grew
and he couldn't cut it:

1053
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,757
And we know he's a boy?

1054
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,878
- His voice:
- The voice is also a bit different?

1055
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,749
When my mama

1056
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,878
gets angry with my papa,

1057
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,717
she shouts, but:

1058
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,277
but in fact,
she hasn't got a soft voice:

1059
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,670
Are men and women
the same or not?

1060
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,796
Not the same:

1061
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,594
Because women have babies:
Boys don't:

1062
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,196
My mother and my father
are almost the same

1063
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,152
but not a lot:

1064
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,075
My father is brown,
my mother is brown:

1065
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,551
Are they different or the same?

1066
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,273
They're the same:

1067
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,759
Can you name anything
that is different?

1068
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,118
Go on, give an example:

1069
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,552
What is being different?

1070
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,912
My sister, she's white,

1071
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,758
and my mother,

1072
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,272
she's black:

1073
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,235
Sometimes,

1074
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,432
we're not the same colour because

1075
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,150
if there's someone who's white,

1076
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,749
the babies will be white:

1077
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,559
My mama and me,

1078
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,390
we're the same colour

1079
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,750
because we look similar

1080
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,868
and we're the same difference:

1081
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,194
It's the same difference,
the same colour? Explain that:

1082
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,751
Are you different or the same?

1083
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,839
- Everything's the same:
- Everything's the same?

1084
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,950
OK:

1085
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,875
In my family, there are just
three of us who are black,

1086
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,799
but there's one who's mixed race:

1087
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,035
That term there,

1088
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,999
mixed race; what does that mean?

1089
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,431
It's black mixed with white
and it makes coffee:

1090
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,671
My sister is not the same as me

1091
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,314
because I'm a bit mixed race,

1092
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,274
and she's a lot more
mixed race than me,

1093
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,596
because I'm the same as my father:

1094
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,677
I don't like being black,
I like to be white:

1095
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:27,710
Why's that?

1096
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,195
Wait, wait:
She has to tell us why:

1097
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,719
Then you can speak:

1098
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,876
Because I don't like black:

1099
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,439
Why is that?

1100
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,639
Because:

1101
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,350
Do you have a reason?
Do you have an explanation?

1102
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,158
No? Yanis?

1103
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,596
I'd like to be white and not black:

1104
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,272
Why would you like to be white?
Stop it, Shana:

1105
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,718
Because white people, well,
they're nicer:

1106
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,876
Do you agree with Yanis?

1107
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,393
- So, explain it to me:
- Yes or no?

1108
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,034
It's that I didn't
really understand:

1109
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,955
I love my brother the way he is,

1110
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,317
even my mama and my papa,
and my dog:

1111
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,160
Black people are stronger
than whites:

1112
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,075
Because IsmaëI,
he's a class below

1113
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,590
he's stronger than Sébastien and me:

1114
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,833
Théo says IsmaëI is black,
so he's stronger:

1115
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,318
Do you think it's because:

1116
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,316
Sébastien is little:

1117
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,752
:his skin is another colour
that he is stronger than him?

1118
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,557
Because Sébastien is that big,
he's big like us:

1119
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,157
Maybe he's ill,
that's why he's small:

1120
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,351
You think it's an illness?

1121
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,556
- No, he was born that way:
- If you're little, you're ill?

1122
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,320
- If you're little, you're different?
- Yes:

1123
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,759
Different from the big ones:

1124
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,151
My father, you can see
that he's handicapped:

1125
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,636
Your papa? There are handicaps
that can be seen?

1126
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,400
Are there things he can do
the same as you?

1127
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,830
- Yes:
- Like what, for example?

1128
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,279
He can:

1129
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,949
He can open the:

1130
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,153
He can't walk like me but

1131
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,631
he can move like me:

1132
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,070
He can talk like me,

1133
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,117
and he can also
read me stories when I:

1134
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,153
You said he can't walk,
then you say he can walk

1135
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,310
like you:

1136
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,988
- That's not what I said:
- Say it again:

1137
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,795
I said he can't walk like me,

1138
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,514
but he can do things like me:

1139
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,318
He moves like you:

1140
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,317
He moves like me, she said:

1141
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,875
Yes, but he can't move his legs
like you:

1142
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,513
That's enough!

1143
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,796
He can read like me:

1144
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,558
Go on, Louise, go on:

1145
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,069
He loves me the same as I love him:

1146
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,591
He loves me the way I am:

1147
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,711
I love him the way he is:

1148
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,950

become a real ballerinal

1156
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,831
I'd like to know something:

1157
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,314
What did the poor to do to be poor?

1158
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,350
Good question:

1159
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,238
People who are poor,

1160
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,313
they live outside,
they don't have a home:

1161
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,353
It means you've nothing,
just bread and water:

1162
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,595
You've only got?

1163
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,909
- Water:
- Only water?

1164
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,953
- You sleep at the station:
- I know about the poor,

1165
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,798
I know a poor person and
he eats leftovers from the trash:

1166
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,513
Poor people,
they're outside in the storm,

1167
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,591
and the storm is scary:

1168
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,075
- It's good to be rich:
- Why's it good?

1169
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,476
You can buy everything:

1170
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,189
What can you buy?

1171
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,039
Food, a car, a motorbike:

1172
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,390
and a tent:

1173
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,596
Are you rich or poor?

1174
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,279
I'm poor:

1175
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,635
Well?

1176
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,796
- I'm poor:
- You are poor?

1177
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,515
Does being rich just mean
having lots of money?

1178
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,557
- Yes:
- How else can you be rich?

1179
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,915
With your friends,

1180
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,793
because if I was rich,

1181
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,514
it wouldn't mean anything to me:

1182
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,438
When I'm with my friends,
I feeI good:

1183
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,868
Bums,

1184
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,680
they've got friends,

1185
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,275
but they don't have
anything to eat:

1186
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:36,830
Listen:

1187
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,919
But they, the bums ask,
they're invisible

1188
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,031
and they ask for food:

1189
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,198
No, bums aren't invisible:

1190
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,477
Because if we don't
give them anything

1191
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,273
they'll die,

1192
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,397
and if we bring them something,

1193
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,398
if we bring them
a little something, then:

1194
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,673
That's why they're mean
with people at times,

1195
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,832
because they're our friends

1196
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,589
and we give them nothing,
so they're mean:

1197
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,270
When we give them something,
they're not mean:

1198
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,595
Give a coin to the poor,
you go to heaven,

1199
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,155
when you're really kind to people:

1200
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,397
Because the last time I gave to:

1201
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,474
I said to my aunt:
"Look, a poor man:"

1202
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,915
She said: "Shall we buy him
a sandwich?" and I said yes:

1203
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,475
Then we bought one
and gave it to him:

1204
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,113
We don't have to give:

1205
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,511
You give money to people,
they'll just buy stuff:

1206
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,789
You're mean:

1207
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,877
No, they should buy
their own stuff:

1208
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,719
You're nasty:
That means you're nasty:

1209
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,997
Yes, you're nasty to others:

1210
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,713
Can we help them?

1211
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,638
They can buy stuff themselves:

1212
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,997
In Melun,
I saw a woman asking for money,

1213
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,553
she had nothing in her pot:

1214
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,394
She had nothing at all:

1215
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,511
We were at the station,

1216
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,875
where the trains are,

1217
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,913
we were going down the steps

1218
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,838
and we saw a lady:

1219
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:18,031
She was praying because she wanted
some money, then she said:

1220
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,835
"Can you give me some money,

1221
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,315
"Can you give me some money:"

1222
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,197
My mother and father
didn't even give any money,

1223
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,990
and I said to mama: "But mama,

1224
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,559
"papa, why don't you
give that lady any money?

1225
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,432
"She's poor:"

1226
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,392
They gave nothing and said:

1227
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,434
"We don't care: We have
to go now or we'll be late:"

1228
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,710
Well done!
No, I'm just kidding:

1229
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,679
If I hadn't any money
and was poor,

1230
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,879
after I couldn't buy
myself anything:

1231
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,199
Can you imagine
being in that lady's place?

1232
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,233
We'll stop there today:

1233
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,998
We can carry on thinking,
but it's very hot,

1234
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,396
I think you all might drop off:

1235
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,636
- I'm sweating:
- OK, let's go:

1236
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,394
- I'm so hot:
- It's very, very hot:

1237
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,436
Yanis, Louise and Eastland,

1238
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,910
I'm sorry but that's unacceptable:

1239
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,078
Come, I want to talk to you:

1240
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,316
Leave me alone, Théo:

1241
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,028
Will hitting her
solve your problem with Louise?

1242
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,034
Yes or no?

1243
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,951
- I don't know:
- You don't know:

1244
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,596
Are there other ways
to solve a problem

1245
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,597
other than hitting children?

1246
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,718
Are there other solutions?

1247
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,199
Look at me:

1248
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,793
What do you think?

1249
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,508
You're a big boy now:

1250
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,073
So:

1251
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,233
Is hitting her the way
to solve things?

1252
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,710
Yes or no, can you tell me?

1253
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,269
What could you do to sort it out?

1254
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,630
- I don't know:
- Well, think:

1255
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,273
I don't know:

1256
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,630
Apart from hitting, what can you do?

1257
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,398
- Nothing:
- What are we learning?

1258
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,676
What are we doing here together?

1259
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,993
You often don't agree,
you and Louise:

1260
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,760
But in philosophy class
do we hit others?

1261
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,791
- What do we do?
- Nothing:

1262
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,514
Nothing?
Don't you talk to each other?

1263
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,430
In philosophy, don't you talk?

1264
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,669
Look at me and tell me the truth:

1265
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,235
What do you both do in philosophy?

1266
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,953
I don't know:

1267
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,513
You talk:

1268
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,438
She says something,
you reply:

1269
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,428
You don't always agree,
but in life we don't always agree:

1270
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,351
When we don't agree
do we hit?

1271
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,152
That's not the solution:

1272
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,317
First, you talk about it:

1273
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,669
OK?

1274
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,673
Run along:

1275
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,197
I want to focus
on the fact that our children,

1276
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,153
if we have stuck to it
in our two schools,

1277
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,954
and if we made an effort previously

1278
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,795
to retain this contract,
it's because we think it matters

1279
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,797
and it's a plus for the kids:

1280
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,070
If they decide to stop it, so be it:

1281
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,635
But that means
we're giving our pupils

1282
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,071
nothing extra,
either in partnership or finance:

1283
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,118
The priority
is the children's well-being:

1284
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,829
FREEDOM?

1285
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,113
When you're in your ma's tummy
you're not free:

1286
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,438
When you come out
of your mother's tummy,

1287
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:41,478
then you're free:
You are alive, sometimes:

1288
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,953
Because you've just been born

1289
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,475
and you can't come out in a hurry:

1290
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,398
That's why babies kick,

1291
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,953
they want to get out:

1292
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,277
But you have to wait a long time,
9 months,

1293
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,916
for the baby to come out:

1294
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,475
- When it comes out, is it free?
- Not free:

1295
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,673
Why is it not yet free?

1296
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,792
Because when you're grown up,

1297
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,231
you're allowed to do
what you want, but not everything:

1298
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,830
You still have
the baby in your body:

1299
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,193
Because you're a baby,

1300
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,598
but after you grow up but it's like
you're still a baby, you:

1301
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,513
Even grown-up,
there's still a baby inside you?

1302
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,598
- Explain this baby part:
- A part of us is baby:

1303
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,031
We have a baby inside ourselves:

1304
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,357
We still have a part of baby
inside our bodies:

1305
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,879
And when you grow up?

1306
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:32,996
When you're adult?

1307
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,033
Have adults
got a part of baby in them?

1308
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,312
No: They've got a child part,

1309
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,990
but when they were like us,
they've got the baby part

1310
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,954
and when they're adults,
they've a part of the body like us:

1311
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,993
What does that change
in terms of freedom?

1312
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,832
Before, I wasn't free,

1313
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,191
because I was still little,

1314
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,879
I was 4 years old:

1315
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,715
My brother's never free cos he's 6

1316
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,070
and what's more he's not even big:

1317
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,672
So your brother's not free:

1318
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,553
Do you think one day he'll be free?

1319
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,590
- Yes:
- When?

1320
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,712
This is the month
when he has his birthday

1321
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,433
and he'll be 7 years old:

1322
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,870
And at 7, will he be free?

1323
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,630
For example, my brother's 10

1324
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,070
and he can't go out:

1325
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,918
So your brother's not free?

1326
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,633
No, he's not free:

1327
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,477
Anissa, we can't hear
each other while you talk:

1328
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:32,152
Me and Naomy
were in the yard, Naomy

1329
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,118
and Shana went

1330
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:39,957
into your classroom,
they were going to look for cakes:

1331
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,752
But you too, as well:

1332
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,918
Shana asked for,
do you know what Shana asked for?

1333
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:45,950
Yes, I know:

1334
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,391
She said:
"Come on, we'II look for some:"

1335
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,909
Yes, but after, we were punished:

1336
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,596
We weren't punished
for a long, long, long time:

1337
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,395
Yes, I know we weren't
punished for a long time:

1338
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,558
We were punished
an almost long time:

1339
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,875
Yes, I know:

1340
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,958
When you're punished,
does it mean you're not free?

1341
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,310
Yes, you're not free, you stay put:

1342
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,432
They were punished,
so they weren't free,

1343
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,119
if I understood right:

1344
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,117
And you were sent outside:

1345
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,158
When you're outside,
you're not free either?

1346
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,554
Yes, you're free:

1347
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,068
But after:

1348
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,872
Yes, you're free:

1349
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,359
But once you were no longer
punished, you were free again?

1350
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,834
- Yes:
- No:

1351
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,073
No, because we're watched
all the time:

1352
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,550
You can't even do what you want:

1353
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,155
When you're in the yard,
are you free?

1354
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,511
There are grills

1355
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,711
and we're not allowed out:

1356
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,993
That's because once we're adults,
we'll be allowed to:

1357
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,278
No wonder there are grills,

1358
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,911
the teachers are worried
we'll run off and get lost,

1359
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,758
if we go out of sight:

1360
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,679
- Then the mothers cry:
- The mamas weep:

1361
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,030
So are you free or not, outside?

1362
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,038
Outside, we're free:
We're with our friends:

1363
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,468
Azouaou?

1364
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,311
One time, there was a boy,
he was big,

1365
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,351
he was in my sister's class:

1366
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,949
He climbed up the grills,

1367
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,312
and he climbed and he climbed
up the schooI fence

1368
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,873
and he left the schooI:

1369
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,958
And so why do you think
he did that?

1370
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,873
- Cos he wanted to be free:
- He wanted to be free:

1371
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,672
Will you be free one day?

1372
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,195
Yes, one day we'll be free:

1373
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,869
- Yes, certainly:
- Yes, it's certain:

1374
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,399
Why certainly?

1375
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,669
If we're never free

1376
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,913
it's because the parents are nasty
and they're not free:

1377
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,635
We're not free
cos we're not grown-up:

1378
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,713
Are adults free or not?

1379
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,673
No, sometimes not:

1380
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,190
Why? What d'you think, N'Dickou?
Rosemay?

1381
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,868
Are papa and mama free?

1382
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:02,556
My papa isn't free
because he has a long job to do,

1383
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,911
and he has to do all the work:

1384
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,718
Do you agree with that?

1385
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,672
When at work, you're not free?

1386
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,233
I agree:

1387
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,634
You think so, Jonathan?

1388
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,717
IsmaëI, I agree:

1389
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,077
- To have days:
- Wait, I can't hear you:

1390
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,477
To have days when you don't work,

1391
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,959
well, we know there are
days of frost:

1392
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,388
Days off!

1393
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:31,918
Days off, yes, when you're tired:

1394
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,118
For example, I, tomorrow
my papa isn't working:

1395
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:41,956
My papa explained to me that
when you work, you earn money,

1396
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,559
and you're free:

1397
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,631
Am I free?

1398
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,319
Yes:

1399
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,673
You're not free
because you ask your kids:

1400
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,876
Cos you've a baby in your tummy:

1401
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,310
Cos I've a baby inside,
I'm not free?

1402
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,635
Yes:

1403
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,478
Who's stopping me be free?

1404
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,318
The baby in your tummy:

1405
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,112
Does it decide for me?

1406
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,153
No, it's you who decides for it:
In its place:

1407
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,839
It decides in place of me?

1408
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,115
No:

1409
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,117
Tell me: Inès?

1410
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,754
Is she pregnant?

1411
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,117
- Miss, are you pregnant?
- Yes, look:

1412
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,833
Yes, it's a boy:

1413
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,593
You know it's a boy?

1414
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,949
She's got two boys:

1415
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,280
Because I just want boys
so I said a boy:

1416
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,710
So it's up to you?

1417
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,113
It's a boy:

1418
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,072
That'll do, that'll do:

1419
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,596
Mouths closed:

1420
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,192
Quiet down:

1421
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,834
That it?
Shall we concentrate again?

1422
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,989
I'd like to go a little further
with what you've said:

1423
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,714
You said adults are free:

1424
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,831
Well, you didn't all agree:

1425
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,156
I'd like to know if I'm free,

1426
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,430
and if mamas and papas are free:

1427
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,234
Are they allowed
to do all they want?

1428
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,031
No:

1429
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,949
- Yes:
- Because they're grown-up:

1430
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,116
Can grown-ups do what they want?

1431
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:09,991
Yes:

1432
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,316
Not everything they want, because:

1433
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,236
Yes:

1434
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,274
No, not everything they want,
cos if you write on a wall,

1435
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,117
the police, there's them too:

1436
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,551
And if you do anything
really serious, you go to prison:

1437
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,159
When you're grown-up,

1438
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,756
and you're a big person,

1439
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,554
well then after
you can do what you want,

1440
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,677
but not just anything:

1441
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:38,237
I'd like to know, is it normaI
for things to be forbidden?

1442
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,149
- Yes, it's normaI:
- No:

1443
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,592
It's cos you're not grown-up?

1444
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,998
And cos parents, sometimes, are
afraid if something happens to us:

1445
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,270
I'm not afraid
if things happen to me:

1446
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,635
Inès?

1447
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,319
Boys aren't scared of things:

1448
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,878
Don't start that again:

1449
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,599
When we're on vacation,

1450
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,439
once I went on vacation,

1451
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,397
I woke up, I opened the door,

1452
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,238
and I left:

1453
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,148
You left?

1454
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,191
I went to my aunt's place,

1455
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,958
then after, I went out again:

1456
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,754
- You went out all alone?
- Yes:

1457
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,788
Are you crazy?

1458
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,878
My aunt's house
is next door to mine:

1459
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,232
The houses are just opposite:

1460
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,318
So you're allowed to go
from one to another?

1461
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,754
You're not allowed:

1462
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,712
- He's not allowed:
- Yes, I am!

1463
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,955
What do you know?

1464
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,832
He goes with someone:

1465
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,993
What if there's a thief?

1466
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,760
There's no thieves
at my place on vacation,

1467
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,313
no, no, no,

1468
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,956
I don't agree, there's no thieves:

1469
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,675
- What if there is one?
- There aren't any where I go:

1470
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,953
What if there's a thief
who buys you candies

1471
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,513
and says to you,
come with me,

1472
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,154
he takes you home
and cuts off your head?

1473
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,119
When I went away
there were no thieves:

1474
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,799
One last thing:

1475
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,468
There are laws about this, maybe?

1476
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:23,668
If there's a thief,
he puts you in the back of his van

1477
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,792
and cuts your head off
and puts you in the woods:

1478
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,355
But those guys don't have trucks:

1479
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,309
They tie us up and take us away,

1480
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,910
once they took my grandma:

1481
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,109
So,

1482
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,958
we're talking about obedience,

1483
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,628
it makes me think of rules
and the law:

1484
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,150
You know what a law is?
Louise said everyone has them:

1485
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,032
No, not in every country:

1486
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,355
- Yes, there is:
- No:

1487
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,512
There aren't any in Africa:

1488
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,233
Why's there none in Africa?

1489
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,550
Because in Africa, they're poor:

1490
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,354
And poor people don't need rules?

1491
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,755
I've got a villa in Africa:

1492
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,549
Kyria?

1493
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,594
They're naked in Africa:

1494
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,155
One time in Africa,

1495
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:14,189
there was someone
who disobeyed something

1496
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,879
and then, and then he was thrown,

1497
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,594
they made a fire,

1498
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,677
and threw the person in the fire:

1499
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,871
It was a hell of a thing:

1500
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,879
No one ever did it again:

1501
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,593
Kyria, then we'll stop:

1502
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,913
Freedom is when there's a little boy

1503
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,872
who says to his mama:

1504
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,389
"I don't want to stay in France,

1505
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,114
I want to go to another country:"

1506
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,029
And when the mother says no,
well, it's a no,

1507
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,789
and when she says yes,
he leaves for another town,

1508
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,912
and the little boy is happy:

1509
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,034
That's good: You began a conclusion:

1510
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,229
Freedom means?

1511
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,758
I say that freedom is when
you can be on your own a little bit,

1512
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,032
breathe a bit, and be kind:

1513
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,550
It's when you go outside alone:

1514
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,830
When you go outside alone, Yanis?

1515
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,071
It's when you can do what you want:

1516
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,598
For me, freedom is when
you come out of prison:

1517
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,951
When you come out of prison:
Any other ideas?

1518
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,310
N'Dickou last and we'll finish:

1519
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,397
I wanted to say

1520
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,789
when, in Africa, or SenegaI,

1521
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,197
when they said
they didn't have any clothes,

1522
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,034
well I have a villa:

1523
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,438
They said they don't have
any clothes,

1524
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,473
well we've got clothes in our villa,

1525
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,955
and mostly we've got maids:

1526
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,991
- You've got?
- Maids:

1527
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,633
- What?
- Housemaids:

1528
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,558
What's that?

1529
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,988
Housemaids is when:

1530
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,838
- Oh, maids!
- That's it, maids:

1531
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,189
Tell us what that is:

1532
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,075
Well, over there, sometimes
in the evening when I'm scared

1533
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:05,716
they give me:
they give me chocolate

1534
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,319
because I was scared:

1535
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,592
They bring it on a tray
to not dirty the bed:

1536
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,119
So they're people?

1537
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,639
Yes, they're people:

1538
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,149
But they're Senegalese:

1539
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,636
I try to talk to them
but they don't understand me:

1540
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,990
Are the housemaids free or not?

1541
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,913
Yes, sometimes they go out
on their own

1542
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,588
to buy things when they're told to,

1543
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,032
and sometimes they buy us candies
at the souvenir shop:

1544
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,312
- Are they adults or children?
- Adults:

1545
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,512
Are they allowed to be free?

1546
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,508
Yes they're allowed,
they're allowed to walk around:

1547
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,994
But sometimes I'm free
all the time over there,

1548
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,758
I'm always going out alone:

1549
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,033
In SenegaI, you're always free,
but not when you come here?

1550
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:54,831
Yes:

1551
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,110
Why that difference?
It's interesting:

1552
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,038
Sorry, we should've stopped:

1553
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,516
What's the difference
between that country and France?

1554
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,154
- It's normaI:
- Why's there a difference?

1555
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:08,716
Because France,
they say sometimes that

1556
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,674
it's a great country,

1557
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,519
but SenegaI is still
a medium country:

1558
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,473
But over there, I go where I want,

1559
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:24,468
I go as far as Dakar beach,

1560
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:29,674
and I also go
even farther than Dakar:

1561
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,236
You can go to Dakar beach?

1562
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,635
Yes, I can go to Almadies:

1563
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,559
- That's cooI:
- Alone?

1564
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,677
To Dakar beach?

1565
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,399
Now the workshop is over:

1566
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,679
On one side, you draw

1567
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,118
a moment of your life, a situation,
when you're free

1568
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,833
and on the other, a time

1569
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,958
or a place where you're not free:

1570
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,719
What's freedom to you?

1571
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,597
Going where I want to go:

1572
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:16,276
I'm not free
when I'm dusting the furniture:

1573
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,876
I'm not free
when I'm dusting the furniture:

1574
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,759
She's not free
cos she was forced to steaI?

1575
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,393
Why did she steaI?

1576
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,792
Why did she steaI the bread?

1577
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,079
Afterwards, there's

1578
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,388
the police who came:

1579
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,999
It was them

1580
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,632
and they put on the handcuffs:

1581
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,918
I don't think all the time:

1582
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,635
Do you like it when you're thinking?

1583
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,838
Why don't you like it?

1584
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,719
Because

1585
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,031
it takes too long:

1586
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,159
OK, that's a reason:

1587
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,510
N'Dickou, do you like thinking?

1588
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,039
I like thinking:

1589
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,151
- Why?
- Because afterwards, it:

1590
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,475
I like sleeping:

1591
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,797
After it gives me
some ideas to do something:

1592
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,796
Hey, N'Dickou!

1593
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,399
That's a good reason, too:

1594
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,591
Yesterday, I couldn't stay awake:

1595
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,473
My brain helps me to think,

1596
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,592
my head helps me think,
it's not tired

1597
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,678
and I talk all the time:

1598
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,516
So you like it: Shall we go on?

1599
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:29,030
I really, really, really
like thinking:

1600
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,310
Why do you like it so much?

1601
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,236
Because dreams,
it's the same as when you think:

1602
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,676
It's beautifuI when you dream:

1603
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,192
I don't like it
cos you force us to think:

1604
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,994
- Who forces you to think?
- Teachers:

1605
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,872
How do they do that?

1606
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,509
Cos we're always doing philosophy:

1607
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,994
And you're forced to?

1608
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,714
All the girls at schooI
force me to think:

1609
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:55,955
They say: "Think:"

1610
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,513
What don't you like?

1611
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,395
That the girls force you to answer
or that you're forced:

1612
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,116
I tell them: "You're not in my body,
you can't controI me:"

1613
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,033
Are you made to think?
Are you forced?

1614
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,278
Boys don't force me:
They say:

1615
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,199
"Don't think,
you won't bug the girls:"

1616
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,311
D'you mean teachers or the girls?

1617
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,954
All the girls get on my nerves:

1618
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,798
Take it easy:
We can't hear each other:

1619
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:37,037
When we're no longer in the class
and we move up to primary,

1620
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,316
we'll no longer do philosophy

1621
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,193
and we won't be able to think:

1622
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,072
Do you agree with that?

1623
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,955
Do you think that
when you leave this schooI:

1624
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,878
We'll no longer do:

1625
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,832
When I was 4,
I didn't understand, but:

1626
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,439
You didn't understand:

1627
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,279
When I started to be 5,
I understood,

1628
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,556
but I don't know if when I move up
to primary if I understand:

1629
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,193
Next year,

1630
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,839
I won't be here anymore,

1631
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,399
and I want to do philosophy

1632
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,353
and I like doing philosophy,

1633
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,237
because I like to think:

1634
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:21,956
But next year
can you try and carry on thinking,

1635
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,559
without us?

1636
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,310
Yes, I could think,

1637
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,511
because my parents

1638
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,715
are going to do philosophy with me

1639
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,717
because we'll have a candle:

1640
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,714
Next year,
we'll have lots of regrets:

1641
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,235
Why will you have lots of regrets?

1642
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,679
Because this schooI,
we'll miss it a lot:

1643
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,108
Why do you say that?

1644
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,472
Because I like being here:

1645
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,269
Cos primary is going to be harder:

1646
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,913
- Is that right?
- Yes:

1647
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,315
It'll be harder, maybe that:

1648
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,795
I won't forget the teacher, anyway:

1649
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,270
- It's over:
- No it's not all over:

1650
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,471
- It is:
- No,

1651
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,671
next year in September:

1652
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,872
- We won't be doing philosophy:
- I know:

1653
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,438
But for the little ones,
it's not completely over:

1654
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,393
It is,
cos the little ones won't do it:

1655
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,116
When the little ones grow up,
they'll be like us,

1656
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,956
and when they do philosophy, well,

1657
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,715
they might be able,

1658
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,036
they'll be able think:

1659
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,717
In the sand pit
with Abi and N'Dickou, me

1660
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,876
and Louise and Léa were talking,

1661
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,356
but at first there was only
Abi, me and N'Dickou,

1662
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,118
and we were talking

1663
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,356
about death and love:

1664
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,033
From the age of 4,

1665
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:16,915
these kindergarten children
attended philosophy workshops

1666
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,348
in a public school:

1667
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:24,033
JUST A BEGINNING

1668
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,669
