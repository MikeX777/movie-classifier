1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,760
I've often dreamed of ringing
in the New Year with my dad.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,640
But I never imagined
it could end up like this.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,920
After seeing what was going on
And understanding it

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,400
Now she acts as if nothing happened

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,160
I don't know

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,040
I don't understand how

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,920
Neither how nor why

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,200
My ego opened a wound

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,400
That you must be aware of

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,000
You see? I'm right

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,240
I've waited long enough for this talk

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,240
It catches my attention
That you've chosen this moment

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,880
To confess to me
That you thought I was heartless

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,920
We both know it

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,400
Each to their own game

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,080
I don't know if it was fate or our paths
That brought us together

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,680
We both know it

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,480
We are what we do

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,760
And there's no hatred
That can't be changed with love

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,960
Love, love, love

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,800
NETFLIX PRESENTS

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,960
This place is fantastic!

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,400
It looks exactly like the pictures online.

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,720
I love it!

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,440
Excuse me, Miss, you have to wait in line
like the rest of the guests.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,240
What kind of service is this?

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,280
Mom!

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,360
What's going on?

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,000
Where have you brought me?

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,480
To a regular place where you wait in line
like everybody else.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,360
Please, don't start making a fuss
about everything.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
I don't want to be kicked out of the hotel
like in Paris.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
Friendy, easy. I mean, relax.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,520
We are in an amazing hotel with your mom.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,440
We're going to have a great time. Relax!

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
I just wanted to be treated like I should.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
No, no!

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,640
That's Crash! And Lady Ant!

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,800
And Kayky, the Brazilian singer!
I love him!

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,960
-He can't see me like this. I'm a mess!
-Toco Para Vos are here too.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,520
I can't believe it! This is too much!
It's amazing!

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,360
I told you! It was obvious!

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,600
We are in one of the best hotels

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,400
with the most trendy and top celebrities,

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
such as Jesse &amp; Joy,

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,880
who, surely, are throwing a private party.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,000
This will be my best ever New Year's.
Wanna know why?

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,680
-Why?
-Because Mía isn't here.

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,320
Friends forever
We know what it feels like

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,200
Hey,

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,240
you could've told your sister
to bring her whole wardrobe.

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,200
You know her.
She changes her clothes 15 times a day.

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,080
Fortunately, my mom...

55
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,040
brought just one.

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,440
We'll need another cart.

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,240
Just one? We'll need 27 more!

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,680
Wait. Hold on.

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,440
You do, since this belongs
to your mom and sister.

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,880
Okay, I get it.

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm spending New Year's
with the clowns Nicoleto and Juan Marulo.

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll be back.

63
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,960
Who's texting you so much?

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,200
Is it Mía?

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,640
And why do you care?

66
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
I don't, but I'm sure Álvaro does.

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,520
I am friends with Mía.
Álvaro and Mía are siblings.

68
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,800
No, they aren't, Juanma. And you know it.

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,120
They are to Mercedes.

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,520
She's stubborn.
She doesn't want them to be close.

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,200
But this won't change
how Álvaro feels about Mía.

72
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
What's going on with Mía?

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,160
Nothing, this just looks exactly
like Mía's suitcase.

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,120
-Yeah.
-You think I'm stupid?

75
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
No, but now that I think of it...

76
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,120
You have a lot of suitcases
and I just have two.

77
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,520
Álvaro, listen to me.

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,440
Why don't you use this trip
as a chance to distance yourself from Mía?

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,440
And to relax. We're on vacation!

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're right. Mía isn't here.

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,160
-Let's go in.
-Yes.

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,600
Hey.

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
Wait for me!

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,160
We're here! Finally!

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,920
-Hello, vacation!
-Safe and sound!

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,120
A ticket to happiness!

87
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,600
My baby!

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,080
-We're here.
-Mr. Achával.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
-Welcome. I'm the hotel manager.
-Thank you.

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,320
-Nice to meet you.
-First of all, I wanted to apologize.

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,680
You booked our other hotel
and we had to cancel.

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,400
-We had to close it due to the storm.
-That's right.

93
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,440
So we had to reaccommodate our guests.

94
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,120
Don't worry, it's exactly the same for us.

95
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,640
It took you an entire day
to bring the suitcases.

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,960
Yes, your employees are very slow.

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,160
-Do you want us to carry you, too?
-Don't give her any ideas, please.

98
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,360
Calm down, please.

99
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,040
Let's start our vacation peacefully.
Is that possible? Thanks.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm worried about Lupe.

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,480
She's tense.

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
What do you expect?

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Her father took his new daughter
on vacation.

104
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,080
Don't put it like that.

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,240
Why do you complicate things with Ramiro?

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,800
Your rooms are ready, so you don't need
to check in at the reception desk.

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
That's great.

108
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,240
And, please, enjoy your stay here.

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,280
-We will!
-Thank you!

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
We're throwing a big New Year's Eve party
for our guests.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,960
New house, new daughter, new girlfriend.

112
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
-Girlfriend?
-What?

113
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
-What do you know?
-You said it. I know nothing.

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,960
That would be the last straw.

115
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,560
A new girlfriend
and he wants to keep what's mine.

116
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,040
No, look. You got to keep the house,
you're negotiating about the school.

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
Yeah, we'll see. He's capable of anything.

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,320
I can't believe we're spending
our first New Year together.

119
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,880
-Neither can I.
-And you let me invite Zoe!

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,200
You're the best dad ever!

121
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,080
-My darling!
-Yes, Ramiro, you're great.

122
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,280
Thanks for inviting me.

123
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,040
I promise to be a good girl.

124
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,280
It makes me very glad
seeing you both like this. Happy.

125
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,000
I know this isn't easy for you.

126
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,120
Don't worry. We came here
to have a good time and to relax,

127
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
so let's just worry about that.

128
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,200
-Okay?
-Perfect.

129
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,160
Got everything?

130
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
-Wait, my backpack!
-All right.

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
Mía!

132
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,520
How long did he hide
that he had another daughter?

133
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,120
How long?

134
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Wasn't it the other way around?

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,280
It doesn't matter.
We're here with the kids

136
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,800
to welcome the New Year
peacefully and happily.

137
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
You're right. We're far away from Ramiro.

138
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,320
Kids, let's go, please.

139
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,520
Wow! It's amazing!

140
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,800
-A margarita, sir.
-Oh, thank you.

141
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,160
-And fruit juice for the girls. Enjoy it.
-Thanks!

142
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,920
This is the coolest!

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,320
I love this place, Zoe!

144
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,280
And it will be even more fun
when Simón arrives.

145
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
-Great.
-Did he say he was here?

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,360
Yes, he has a vacation job here.

147
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,920
Why are you smiling?

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
Who is it? Álvaro?

149
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
-Juanma.
-What? I can't believe it.

150
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,800
Stop. We won't talk about Juanma
or Álvaro during our vacation.

151
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,520
Let's focus on New Year's Eve

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,920
and having fun
with my dad and my best friend.

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,360
-Let's go.
-Okay.

154
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
You're wearing every possible color.

155
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,440
I need to light up the beach.

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,320
-I'm starving.
-Yes, I could eat an elephant.

157
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
-Have you seen Lupe?
-No, I haven't seen Mía.

158
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,560
-You're so annoying.
-You mean Lupe, right?

159
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Yes, Lupe.

160
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,320
But you said Mía.

161
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,920
You're talking to her again.

162
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,600
And what if I am?
Does that bother you?

163
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,320
Stop it, guys. Can we have some peace?

164
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's go to the beach to relax.

165
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Is it here?

166
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,800
-It's here!
-Yes! Breakfast, finally!

167
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,800
But...

168
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,640
I'm not seeing any food.

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,920
No, Agustina, Jesse &amp; Joy were here,

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,080
on this very spot,
with this palm tree, under this sun.

171
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,320
-Let me see.
-They even swam!

172
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,760
Are you serious?
That picture is old! It's from yesterday!

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,160
I can't believe it.

174
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,960
The flight was endless,

175
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm hungry, and we are here
because of an old picture?

176
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,320
Are you listening to yourself?
Jesse &amp; Joy were here!

177
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,040
What's more important than that?

178
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Oh, no.

179
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,160
You were obsessed with Mía
all year long,

180
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,360
and now you're obsessed with Joy.

181
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
I can't believe it! I'm going to eat!

182
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,440
I knew I should have brought Sofía
instead of you.

183
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,040
Look, Sofía wouldn't have come

184
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,280
because she needed a break from you.

185
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,800
Agustina!

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,960
Simón told you he was here?
I can't find him anywhere.

187
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,280
I don't see him either.

188
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,120
What's wrong, Zoe?

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,600
-You look like you've seen a ghost.
-Worse.

190
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,520
I hate mascot costumes.
They make me feel like boxing.

191
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,520
Don't exaggerate!

192
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,960
Make him go away!

193
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,200
Calm down, Zoe.

194
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
-And he's provoking me!
-Zoe!

195
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,120
No! Zoe!

196
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,800
No! Zoe!

197
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
-Simón!
-Yes, it's me!

198
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,000
-Hi, girls! Tudo bem?
-Hi, Simón!

199
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
How are you?

200
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
Zoe, you're still afraid of mascots

201
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
like when we were kids.

202
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
-You scared me! It's not funny.
-You're crazy.

203
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,000
Now that we're together,

204
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,760
this is going to be
the best New Year ever!

205
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,800
Yes!

206
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,120
So peaceful!

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
And relaxation. This is heaven, my friend.

208
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Sometimes you need to get away
to get some quiet.

209
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,800
-Yes.
-Hi, guys.

210
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,440
-Hello.
-Good morning.

211
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,760
Why the long faces?

212
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,160
Don't you realize you're in paradise?

213
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,280
This place is great, Dad!
We've just seen the pool, and it's huge!

214
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,720
And we heard people talking about
the New Year's Eve party

215
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,000
and Giulia Be is singing!

216
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,240
-That's great!
-Thank you for bringing us here.

217
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,360
Did you eat something bad?
You're unbearable.

218
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
Juanma ate a clown this morning.

219
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,640
Let's leave clowns out of it.
I've been afraid of them since--

220
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,640
Don't you get tired of fighting every day?

221
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
-We just arrived!
-Let them be.

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,400
If they want to ruin their summer,
it's their problem.

223
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,880
Nothing will keep me
from smiling like this.

224
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,880
-Good morning.
-Hi!

225
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,360
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,560
-Hi, Simón!
-Bom dia. Tudo bem?

227
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,000
What are you doing here?
Aren't you the mascot?

228
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,720
I'm multitasking.
I'm the mascot, I'm a waiter...

229
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,640
And I teach aqua dance lessons.

230
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
You're multi-functional.

231
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,600
I hope you can find some time
for your friends.

232
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,520
Of course.

233
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,880
-Shall we have breakfast?
-Yes, let's go.

234
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,080
Coffee or milk?

235
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Aqua dance?

236
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,480
Is this the cheese you like, honey?

237
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,720
-Yes, I want some.
-There.

238
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,840
It's all tasty. I don't know what to eat.

239
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,400
Well, let's eat!

240
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,400
You can't begin to imagine
how much I needed this vacation, sweetie.

241
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
With nobody to disturb us.

242
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
A vacation from Mía, basically.

243
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,040
Nothing will get between us

244
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
in this haven of happiness.

245
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,520
Those are delicious.

246
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,840
You!

247
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,440
You!

248
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,720
What are you doing here?

249
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,040
What are you doing here?

250
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
You took a flight
to ruin New Year's Eve for me?

251
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,880
-I didn't know you were here.
-Yeah, right.

252
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,600
-If you picked up your phone...
-Now it's my fault?

253
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,280
-It's nobody's fault.
-What?

254
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,680
You stole my dad
and now you want to steal my trip.

255
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,960
Lupe! Come on!

256
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Defending your new daughter, as usual.

257
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,320
-Hi, Ramiro.
-Hi, Álvaro.

258
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,480
Álvaro!

259
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,520
She's your sister.

260
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,400
-She's not, Mom!
-Yes, she is.

261
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,120
Do not cross the security perimeter.

262
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,640
What are you talking about?

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,800
Ramiro, pack your things
and go, please.

264
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
No way!

265
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,040
It's New Year's Eve tomorrow.

266
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,600
Besides, this place is huge.
We won't bump into one another.

267
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,000
Leave immediately!

268
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,320
Calm down, Lu.

269
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,760
If we all do our part,

270
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
there shouldn't be any trouble.

271
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Okay, perfect.

272
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,120
We are leaving then.

273
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,080
-What?
-No! They should leave!

274
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
All right, then.

275
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay.

276
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,760
We're staying, but with one condition.

277
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,960
You two... keep your distance.

278
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,400
I don't want you close to Mía, Álvaro.

279
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,120
Otherwise,
we'll be on the next plane out of here.

280
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,280
-What are you saying, Mom?
-A plane!

281
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
-I can't believe this.
-Neither can I!

282
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
You have a great talent
for screwing things up, Mía.

283
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,360
-Lupe, don't go!
-Mía, wait.

284
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Hey, what did your mom say?

285
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,600
If you get close to her...

286
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,760
-A plane.
-I have to talk to her.

287
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,480
-No, not now.
-Please, Álvaro.

288
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,280
She's mad. Give her time.

289
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,240
Mía!

290
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,200
Hi!

291
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,200
Nobody wants to ruin your New Year.

292
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,160
Sure. Why would you bother?
You've ruined my whole life.

293
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,960
-It doesn't have to be this way.
-No.

294
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,920
-It would be great if you weren't here.
-But here I am.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,920
Yes, here, at school, in GO!
Where else do you want to be?

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,320
And on the stage, right?

297
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,720
But that doesn't bother you that much.

298
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you remember the song we were writing?
I finished it.

299
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,920
-I don't care. Leave me alone.
-Listen.

300
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,840
I told you I don't care. Leave!

301
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
You're so annoying!

302
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,600
Sun, sand and sea
It could be a dream

303
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,760
But here we are

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,160
I don't want to hear it.

305
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,200
What has been good is a memory now

306
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,040
And what has been bad

307
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,360
Will teach us.

308
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,520
Even though we're different

309
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,800
Like oil and water

310
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I know that if we're together

311
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,440
We are more

312
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,200
You supplement everything I need

313
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,040
And what you lack

314
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,000
I can give it to you

315
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,080
You're like me
Because you know what you want

316
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,600
You want like me
When you know what you want

317
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,000
If we talk, it isn't that bad

318
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,240
We don't need to talk
If there's nothing to discuss

319
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,240
You're like me
Because you know what you want

320
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,960
You want like me
When you know what you want

321
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,400
If we talk, it isn't that bad

322
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,880
We don't need to talk
If there's nothing to discuss

323
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,920
I know sometimes you want me to stay away

324
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,960
Really far away.

325
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,520
But in that moment

326
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,720
I want to hug you

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,920
If you could only see the way I see you

328
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,720
You'd be afraid

329
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
And fear makes you fail

330
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,120
I know we're different

331
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,680
-Hot and cold
-North and south, east and west

332
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,400
-Our paths can't cross
-Black and white, fire and snow

333
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,920
But we're the same in the end

334
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,360
You're like me
Because you know what you want

335
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,240
You want like me
When you know what you want

336
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,440
If we talk, it isn't that bad

337
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,000
We don't need to talk
If there's nothing to discuss

338
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,240
Okay, Mía, don't be cheesy now.

339
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,960
We are sisters.

340
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,400
Well, half sisters, but sisters in music.

341
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,400
I know you feel that magical connection
we have when we sing together.

342
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,360
That's true. But I can't stand you.

343
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,360
Friends?

344
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,400
Not enemies. But only for the time being.

345
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,560
That's a new start.

346
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
Could you do something for me?

347
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,360
Of course.

348
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,240
Pack your things and leave.
This won't end well.

349
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,440
Excuse me.

350
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,120
-Is Lupe here?
-Yes.

351
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,040
Good.

352
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,800
What are you doing here?

353
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
We need to talk, daughter.

354
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,960
No, we don't.

355
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,160
And stop calling me "daughter."

356
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,640
Is this how it's going to be from now on?

357
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,920
Now you have another daughter
who you love more.

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,840
You're spending New Year's Eve with her.

359
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,760
You didn't want to come with us.

360
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,560
You mean with "you."
There's no "us" anymore.

361
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,920
Please, Lupe, honey.

362
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
I know this is hard for you.

363
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,040
-For everyone.
-You don't know what I'm going through.

364
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,760
Come on, baby.

365
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,280
Don't call me that. I'm not five anymore.

366
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,200
And if someone hears you,
I'll be embarrassed.

367
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,080
You'll always be my baby girl.

368
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,040
The one with the most beautiful eyes
in the world.

369
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,440
With shiny hair.

370
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,600
Do you remember

371
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,240
the liters of imaginary tea

372
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,720
that we drank dressed as ladies?

373
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,760
Do you remember?

374
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,240
And all the routines you made me dance?

375
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,920
Sweetie...

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,240
we'll always be us, you know?

377
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,120
I know.

378
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,680
But I need time to digest this.
It's not easy.

379
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,680
I know.

380
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,960
We all need some time.

381
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,760
All of us.

382
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,440
I love you, honey.

383
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
What are you doing here?

384
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,040
I'm talking to my daughter, Mercedes.

385
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
-Sleep well, darling.
-Thanks, Dad.

386
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,840
-Good night.
-You too.

387
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Sweetie.

388
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
Are you okay?

389
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,240
Yes, thank you.

390
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,040
-Come here. Help.
-What is it?

391
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,440
The paparazzi, there.

392
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,800
-Would you hug me?
-Yes.

393
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,760
There they are!

394
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,240
Thank you! You saved my life.

395
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
Aren't you...

396
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
-Meri from Toco Para Vos?
-Yes.

397
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,600
And you?

398
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,160
-Juanma. There's a song I love.
-Which one?

399
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,400
-I love it.
-You have a great voice.

400
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,360
-Thanks.
-I know you from somewhere.

401
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,600
I don't think so.

402
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,280
Aren't you in the group
from the final of Nationals?

403
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,400
GO! Yes, we got second place.

404
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,960
-I watched it online. You're amazing.
-Thanks.

405
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,000
I love that song that goes...

406
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,800
I'm not afraid to love

407
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,720
Love is stronger

408
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,960
-I can't believe it.
-Yes, I love it.

409
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,600
I don't know how to thank you for this.

410
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,880
Don't worry. Just call me
if you need a fake boyfriend.

411
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,640
-I sure will.
-Meri! Are you okay?

412
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,280
Yes, Jairo, thanks to Juanma.

413
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,840
-You saved us, brother.
-Hi.

414
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,080
I'm Jairo.

415
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,000
PR for the guys and other bands.

416
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,280
The party!

417
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,600
-Should we invite him?
-Yes!

418
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,640
We're having a private party today
with Jesse &amp; Joy.

419
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,160
-At the beach. You can come if you want.
-We'll be playing there.

420
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,880
-Cool! Sure.
-Hand me your phone.

421
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,760
-I'm saving my number.
-Great.

422
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,640
And the party information.

423
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,560
-Great. Thanks.
-Bring whoever you want.

424
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,280
-See you there!
-Bye!

425
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,240
No!

426
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,320
Thanks for scaring me.

427
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make you smile.

428
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,000
What a mess, right?

429
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,800
Yes, but let's have a peaceful New Year,
please.

430
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
That's the only thing I want.

431
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,680
And I'd like to know what will happen
with us when we go back.

432
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,920
What are you two doing?

433
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,520
If Mercedes catches you...

434
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,920
Don't be mean.

435
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,880
-Mercedes!
-Could you just stop it?

436
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,880
No, she's really coming! Get down!

437
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,160
Juanma.

438
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,040
Have you seen Álvaro?

439
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,360
No.

440
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,400
Me neither.

441
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,760
Please tell him
that I left his sunblock on the chair.

442
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,040
Okay, I'll tell him.

443
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,680
I'll look around.

444
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,560
You look gorgeous under the sun.

445
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
You should...

446
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,840
Should I? Really?

447
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,360
Yes, come on.

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,840
Is she gone?

449
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,000
She left a while ago.

450
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,000
I can't believe this.

451
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
Ramiro is talking to a woman.

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,640
That's the person I'll be fighting
for my possessions.

453
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
Ramiro's little girlfriend.

454
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,880
Girlfriend? He met her five minutes ago.
She's the windsurf instructor.

455
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,040
Flor, can you see her
as Lupe and Álvaro's stepmother?

456
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,960
No.

457
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,600
This is absurd.

458
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,400
After me, Ramiro should be with a more...

459
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,600
Sane, sensible, and rational woman?

460
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,200
Let me listen.

461
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Ramiro! We hadn't seen you here.

462
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,600
No, we hadn't seen you
or that girl you're talking to.

463
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,720
We're discussing
if she's your new girlfriend or what--

464
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,880
Oh, this place is wonderful.

465
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,680
It has some lovely flora and fauna.

466
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,200
-Mature ladies...
-What?

467
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,640
Distinguished ladies
playing hide and seek.

468
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,000
Or are you following me?

469
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,560
Come on, Ramiro!

470
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,360
Quite the contrary,

471
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,600
I think you're looking for an excuse to--

472
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,240
To captivate women who teach water sports.

473
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
Come on.

474
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,640
Couldn't we call a truce?

475
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,960
Please.

476
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,240
-We'll talk when we're back home.
-Okay.

477
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,560
Bye!

478
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,440
Honestly, my friend,

479
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
you have such bad luck.

480
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,840
To end up at the same hotel
as Álvaro, Lupe, and Mercedes.

481
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Zoe, I can't believe how good you are
at cheering me up.

482
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,320
Wow! Your phone is blowing up!

483
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,280
It's Juanma. He's invited me
to Jesse &amp; Joy's party.

484
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,640
We're going to Jesse &amp; Joy's party!

485
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,120
Awesome, my friend.

486
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,040
Oh, right. He's only invited you.

487
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,760
Yes. And you can't say a word
to anyone, okay?

488
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,120
Are you texting Mía?

489
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,760
Álvaro, my mom does let me talk to her.

490
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,000
Okay?

491
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,400
Álvaro or Juanma?

492
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,680
Álvaro, Juanma, Álvaro.

493
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,800
We could use this for a song.

494
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Yes!

495
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,200
They're driving me nuts!

496
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm turning it off and going to ask my dad
if I can go to the party.

497
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,800
Sure, he'll let you!

498
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,280
Why wouldn't he?

499
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,680
I can think of a million reasons.

500
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,480
Zoe, you're infecting me
with such bad vibes today.

501
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
It's not funny.

502
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,240
-What did you do? She's not replying.
-What's wrong? Are you jealous?

503
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
Yes, you are.

504
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,080
Look, guys.

505
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,840
I sense some tension here.
Let's relax, okay?

506
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,400
We can go to the spa or the gym...

507
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
No, not the gym. It has a boxing ring.

508
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm going for a walk.

509
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,960
Okay.

510
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm sure he's going to see Mía.

511
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,000
Hey, Álvaro,

512
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,080
you're obsessed with Mía.

513
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
If she's in love with you,
you'll end up together.

514
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
Juanma won't stop you. Nobody will.

515
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,520
You've done everything but chase her
in a costume, so your mom can't see you.

516
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,680
Sweetie! I was about to call you.

517
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,040
They're showing one of my favorite
musicals at the hotel cinema.

518
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,880
It's a classic. You'll love it.

519
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,280
And I was about to tell you
that I've been invited to a party today.

520
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,840
A party? Here at the hotel?

521
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,520
No, it's a private party at the beach
thrown by Jesse &amp; Joy!

522
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,440
A private party somewhere I don't know
outside the hotel?

523
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,800
Honestly, I don't know.

524
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,080
I guess you're all going together.
You, Simón and Zoe?

525
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,960
No. This time it's just me and Juanma.

526
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,600
Honey, I understand you're excited,

527
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,600
but what you're asking for is crazy.

528
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,880
-Dad!
-Honey...

529
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,920
Am I not old enough to go to a party?

530
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,040
I'm just asking you
to have a little bit of trust in me.

531
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
This is not about trust.

532
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,440
You're asking to go
to a party somewhere I don't know

533
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,160
and full of strangers.

534
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,800
Besides, tomorrow it's the hotel party

535
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,360
and we're welcoming the New Year
together for the first time.

536
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,320
Come on, Dad!

537
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,160
Mía, please. End of discussion.

538
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,920
I know...

539
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,960
Would you like some water?

540
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,240
Okay.

541
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,560
Well, it looks like
you're having a hard time.

542
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
You can't imagine
how much I needed this massage.

543
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,160
Where's Mía?

544
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,320
-Speak of the devil.
-I need your help!

545
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,640
Look, it's okay if you want to see Álvaro,

546
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,920
but leave us out of it.

547
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,240
This is not about him.

548
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,160
I want to go to Jesse &amp; Joy's party
but my dad won't let me.

549
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,560
-Trouble!
-No, no.

550
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,320
Not only are we not invited,
but she also wants to get us in trouble.

551
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,960
-For her.
-No, no.

552
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,400
But I also know you're the best friends
in the world

553
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,520
and that you'll help me go to this party.

554
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,520
That's a yes. I'm getting changed! Bye!

555
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,840
You said yes, Zoe?

556
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,840
Trouble, trouble.

557
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,760
Isn't that Lupe and Agus?

558
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,200
Yes, that's right.

559
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,120
I was so calm without you guys here!

560
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,400
And now I have to put
that horrible mascot costume back on.

561
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,520
Bye, Zoe.

562
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,240
Wait! I can't keep up.

563
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,200
You see?

564
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,840
The only thing I see here, Lupe,
is that you are the problem.

565
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,640
Can't you see
she keeps taking what's mine?

566
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,120
Don't you get it?

567
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,680
And what's yours this time?

568
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,280
Jesse &amp; Joy's party.

569
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,560
Jesse &amp; Joy's party, exactly. Not yours.

570
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,160
Agustina, my place is at that party.

571
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,520
Okay.

572
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,600
Let me remind you of something.

573
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,280
You can't always get what you want.

574
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,080
Simón, we need to find Mía urgently.
Where are you?

575
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,640
Hey, come here, ugly mascot.

576
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Come here. We need to tell Mía

577
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,360
that Lupe knows she's going
to Jesse &amp; Joy's party with Juanma.

578
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,200
The last thing we need now, Simón,
is for--

579
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,920
-For Álvaro to find out, right?
-No, no.

580
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,960
-Got it, Zoe.
-Come here, Álvaro!

581
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,680
One, two, three, four...

582
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,400
Hi!

583
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,160
Are you okay, Juanma?

584
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,480
Yes, you just look gorgeous.

585
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,920
-Yes, but we're friends.
-I know.

586
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,120
And as your friend,
I'm gonna ask you a favor.

587
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,160
Close your eyes.

588
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,120
Trust me. Close your eyes.

589
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,640
Open them.

590
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,680
No!

591
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,800
I rented a limo!

592
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,400
No! Let's go now!

593
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,760
Excuse me, could you get me
a taxi, a horse, anything?

594
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,880
-Thanks.
-I won't go on a horse.

595
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,760
You're not going anywhere.

596
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,880
You're the one who's not going anywhere.

597
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I'll have to tell Mom, and you...

598
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,760
Plane.

599
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,720
Do I have a choice?

600
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,760
Wait, Lupe. If he won't take us,
we can go on foot.

601
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,800
It was just a suggestion.

602
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,040
I'll go change. I'll be right back.

603
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,600
Wait, I have a question.

604
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,440
Obviously we're the guests of honor
at this party.

605
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,000
Always worrying about details.

606
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,560
Is it a detail to know how on earth
we can get into Jesse &amp; Joy's party?

607
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,120
Relax!

608
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,520
We're getting in
if it's the last thing I do.

609
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,680
And?

610
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,120
Nothing. She's not answering.
It must be really noisy at the party.

611
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,080
Can we talk, Mía?

612
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,400
What do we do?

613
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
-Get into bed.
-No, you do it.

614
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
No, Simón! You!

615
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,080
No. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

616
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,640
Rock, paper, scissors.

617
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,600
-To bed, Mía.
-Okay, I'm going.

618
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,560
Open up!

619
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
-Hi, Ramiro.
-I need to speak to my daughter.

620
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,720
-Yes, but we are--
-Thank you very much.

621
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,200
Sweetie.

622
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,800
Can we talk, honey?

623
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,640
What are you doing under there?
Don't be ridiculous.

624
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,160
Maybe give her some time.

625
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,360
-Mía, listen to me.
-No.

626
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,960
Are you okay?

627
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,520
Let's move on.

628
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,240
All right?
And let's think about the future.

629
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Let's think about
our first New Year's Eve together.

630
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,080
It's going to be amazing.

631
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,280
Okay.

632
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,440
-Talk to her.
-I will.

633
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,840
Advice from a friend is more effective.

634
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,920
Sure.

635
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,640
-Come here.
-That was close, Zoe!

636
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,960
-Yes. Come on.
-Text Mía right now.

637
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm on it, Simón.

638
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,120
Wow, this place is amazing!

639
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,800
-Toco Para Vos are playing. I love them!
-I told you.

640
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,760
Hey!

641
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,680
-How you doing, man?
-What's up?

642
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,840
-Enjoy the party.
-Thanks.

643
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,440
That was Kayky. I love him!

644
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,160
And best of all,
Jesse &amp; Joy are playing next!

645
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,040
I love it! Let's go dance!

646
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,480
Hi all! Welcome to my party.

647
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,880
I hope you have fun.

648
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,040
And now let's hear it for my sister Joy.

649
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,000
I can't believe Jesse &amp; Joy
are playing in front of us.

650
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,040
-It's amazing.
-I told you you had to come.

651
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Let's keep dancing.

652
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,840
-I'll go get us something to drink.
-Okay.

653
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,000
-Here we are.
-The party's in there.

654
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,160
How do we get in?

655
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,520
Crash is about to arrive.

656
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,120
Let her in, please.
She's playing in a few minutes.

657
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,120
Okay.

658
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,120
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

659
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,320
I'm thinking what I'm thinking.

660
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,480
I came up with it.
I don't need accomplices.

661
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,480
I'm awesome.

662
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,240
-Hi. Don't you know who I am?
-No.

663
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,440
-Crash.
-I'm not doing this.

664
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,360
I'm playing soon and you won't let me in?

665
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,120
You'll ruin the party
and Jesse &amp; Joy will get mad.

666
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,520
Who are they?

667
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
My assistant and my stylist.

668
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,920
Hi!

669
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm sorry about that.

670
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,920
Thank you.

671
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,680
Thanks.

672
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,880
They'll figure it out. You're both crazy.

673
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,560
You're always such a killjoy.

674
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,720
That won't get you anywhere.

675
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,840
It's only because I have a mad friend.

676
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,320
Are you okay with this?

677
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,560
Don't ask me. I'm just the stylist, Agus.

678
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,680
-See you.
-What?

679
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,360
Copy that. Crash is here.

680
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,080
Her stylist.

681
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,320
Nico!

682
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,000
-No! Come here.
-Where are you going? Don't move.

683
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,520
No! I see trouble coming
and I need some peace.

684
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,920
You won't find it here.

685
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,120
-Try a different hotel.
-What happened?

686
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,360
Álvaro went to the party
with Juanma and Mía.

687
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,680
-No!
-Yes.

688
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
How did he find out?

689
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,640
-Zoe--
-It's a long story. What do we do now?

690
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,880
-I'll go back to work.
-No.

691
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,320
Mercedes and Ramiro
can't find out about this.

692
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,680
-Yes, absolutely.
-Yes.

693
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,600
Guys!

694
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,320
What's wrong?

695
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,760
Have you seen an alien?

696
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,080
-I haven't seen Álvaro. Have you?
-No, neither have I.

697
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,320
How did you know
I was going to ask about him?

698
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Because I have mind powers.

699
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,760
I see things.

700
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,880
Great, use them to tell me
why he's not answering his phone.

701
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,360
I saw him dressed as a mascot
and he found out everything.

702
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,640
-Everything?
-And he rushed to the party.

703
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,080
What?

704
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,040
It's just that Simón has to dance today
at the pool party.

705
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,400
That's it!

706
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,560
And your son is pretty funny, right?

707
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,200
He wanted to play a joke on Simón,
so he hid his costume.

708
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,360
-My costume!
-Now we can't find it.

709
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,640
That costume! Well, if you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

710
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,840
-Right...
-Away.

711
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,720
Right away.

712
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,640
This is the best party I've ever been to.

713
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
I told you you'd have fun.

714
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,840
Don't look at me like that.

715
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,000
-Like what?
-Like that.

716
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,760
Like this?

717
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,120
What if I break my promise?

718
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,800
Watch out!

719
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,880
-I'm sorry.
-No!

720
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,440
Are you okay?

721
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm... soaking wet.

722
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,360
No...

723
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,120
No! What happened?

724
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
Nothing. It was that guy...

725
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,840
You helped me at the hotel.

726
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,560
-I'll get you clean clothes. Follow me.
-I'll wait here.

727
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,480
-Mía! What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

728
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,360
Juanma brought you here
and left you alone? That's not cool.

729
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
Why don't we dance together then?

730
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
It's great music.

731
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,640
Don't be so boring!

732
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,520
Even though we think it's crazy...

733
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,560
Let's do what your mom says.
It's the only way to keep the peace.

734
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,800
Even though it's hard for me...

735
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,960
I say no.

736
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,680
And what if I say yes?

737
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,400
If I tell you I can't do it?

738
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,520
That it's harder than scoring
without looking at the hoop?

739
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,800
We'll have to try.

740
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,840
What? Is it easy for you?

741
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,840
I don't buy it.

742
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
Mía, are you dating Juanma?

743
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,200
What?

744
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,680
You text each other, you come
to this party together... I don't know.

745
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,880
Juanma is my friend.

746
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,880
Just like you.

747
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,080
-Any news, Nico?
-No.

748
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,320
It's impossible.

749
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,400
Álvaro is not answering.
Mercedes keeps looking for him.

750
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,960
I don't know how to hide this.

751
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,160
With anything but the mascot costume.

752
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,480
Excuse me, guys.

753
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,480
Mía won't come down to eat?

754
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,600
-No, she's resting.
-She fell asleep.

755
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,640
I'll go get her.

756
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,840
-Okay.
-You won't find her.

757
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,880
All right, so, when Ramiro comes back,

758
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,680
we tell him that Mía was here
and left again, okay?

759
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,360
-Perfect.
-Yes, you're a genius!

760
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,000
-Great idea.
-Mercedes is coming.

761
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
-Álvaro!
-Where?

762
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,720
-Álvaro!
-Listen, I needed to ask you something.

763
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,120
What?

764
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,080
Do you know what time
they're screening that UFO movie?

765
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,920
Nicolás, do I look like
an alien movie person?

766
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,400
But it's a musical!

767
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,040
-You love musicals!
-Where is he?

768
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,800
He went that way.

769
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
-Where?
-He went that way, but he did this.

770
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,720
And now, I really don't know where he is.

771
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,280
Guys, it's time to call Lupe.

772
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,840
-Hi, Nico. What's up?
-Where are you?

773
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,840
At Jesse &amp; Joy's private party...

774
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,880
Who's this?

775
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,080
-Zoe. Don't hang up.
-It's Zoe.

776
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,880
What do you need?

777
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,360
Do you know where Álvaro is?

778
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,120
No, and I don't see him around here.
Why am I talking to you? Bye.

779
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,520
Look who's coming.

780
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,320
No, I can explain it.
It was just a mix-up.

781
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,840
Crash, they're waiting for you.

782
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,440
Crash.

783
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,040
I need your help.

784
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Give this to the DJ. It's my track.

785
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,920
-Yes, I'll do it for you, pop star.
-I have her.

786
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,760
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

787
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,080
-Where do you think you're going?
-I'm singing. It's late, let me in.

788
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,120
Who are you?

789
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,080
Crash.

790
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,480
I've just let her in.

791
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,880
How is that possible?

792
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
-What's going on?
-He says he already let Crash in.

793
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
No, you're mistaken.

794
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,040
I'm sorry, but she can't come in.

795
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,200
Don't worry.
Let me make a phone call. We'll fix this.

796
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,280
Hi! How are you?

797
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,280
You know who I am

798
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,800
I don't need an introduction

799
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,760
You speak badly of me

800
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,720
You say I'm the worst

801
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,520
But in the end you want to be just like me

802
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,080
One, two, three

803
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,800
They say I'm cold

804
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,800
And extremely conceited

805
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,400
That I wouldn't be here
If it weren't for my parents

806
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,400
That I'm selfish and boring

807
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
That I only have two friends

808
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,080
That I'm not cool anymore

809
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,200
And that my outfit is dull

810
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,040
You get together to criticize me

811
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,840
But I know you want to copy me

812
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,840
I know you look at my Instagram stories

813
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,960
You know them by heart

814
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,840
I know who I am no matter what they say

815
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,640
Those who criticize me
Have no choice

816
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,480
Love me or hate me, I'm beyond compare
You'll apologize even if you don't want to

817
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,960
In the end, you want to be just like me

818
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,760
Your envy is what makes me go on

819
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,120
I don't waste any time
I know what I want

820
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,360
No hater can stop me
I know where I'm going

821
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,240
In the end, you want to be just like me

822
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,080
Your envy is what makes me go on

823
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,480
I don't waste any time
I know what I want

824
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,280
No hater can stop me
I know where I'm going

825
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,280
Is that Lupe?

826
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,640
How did she get in?

827
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,000
It's a long story.

828
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,720
-And full of lies probably.
-Yes, that too.

829
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
You want to be like me

830
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,400
Bravo, Lu!

831
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,720
Can we talk now, Mía?

832
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
No, please.

833
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
But I say yes. Please, come with me.

834
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,200
Let's go.

835
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,400
Any news, Nico?

836
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,240
No. I don't know what to do.

837
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,480
Look, Lupe hasn't seen them,
nobody answers the phone,

838
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,680
Juanma, Álvaro, and Mía together...
This is a mess!

839
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
Are you there, Álvaro?

840
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,600
It's Mercedes.

841
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,840
What should we do?

842
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,400
-Hold on.
-What do we do?

843
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,720
Go into the bedroom. Come on.

844
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,880
The costume.

845
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,080
Hide the costume.

846
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,360
-Okay.
-Okay.

847
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,640
I know!

848
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,320
Pretend you're Álvaro. Put that away
and get into the bathroom, quickly!

849
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,240
The bathroom!

850
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,240
Son!

851
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,400
Yes, I'm coming, Mercedes!

852
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,200
What do I do?

853
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,840
Hide in the shower!

854
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,880
In the shower? Okay.

855
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,800
-Yes, here.
-This is insane!

856
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,680
-What if she comes in?
-She won't if her son is showering.

857
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,600
Oh, right. What? Showering?

858
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,240
-That's right.
-No, I'm not showering!

859
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,640
No!

860
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,240
No!

861
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,280
Thanks! I'll sign an autograph
and we'll take some pictures.

862
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,920
They loved me. Do you love me?

863
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,760
I love you! You were great!

864
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,440
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

865
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,480
I'm terrific, very talented.

866
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,800
-What's wrong? They wanted one more song.
-No, no.

867
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,080
Take this off.

868
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,520
You pretended to be me
to sing in my place?

869
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,560
-Hi.
-Where's my son?

870
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,160
-Well, if I explain it, you'll laugh.
-No, don't.

871
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,120
Your explanations don't explain a thing.
Where's Álvaro?

872
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,040
In the shower.

873
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
Are you there, son?

874
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,880
Yes!

875
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,840
That's it, he's taking a shower.
Your son is so--

876
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,520
Son...

877
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,720
Grandma Vilma sends her regards.

878
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,280
Send her a kiss from me.

879
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,480
There's no Grandma Vilma in our family.

880
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,720
Who's in there?

881
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,640
Well... No, wait--

882
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,600
Álvaro!

883
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,080
Hi, Mercedes!

884
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,840
Dear Headmistress, how are you?
Tudo bem?

885
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,480
Could you pass me a towel?

886
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,840
Where's my son?

887
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,360
He's at Jesse &amp; Joy's party.

888
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,320
I can explain.

889
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,360
And who are you?

890
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
Her stylist. I mean, her PR--

891
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,880
No, she's my assistant.

892
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,640
It was a mistake,
I didn't mean to impersonate you.

893
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,760
It was just a mix-up.

894
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,680
-Come with me, please.
-Agustina.

895
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,240
Hi? Mercedes?

896
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,320
Oh, no.

897
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,280
Please, don't start.

898
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,960
I don't know what to do
To get you out of my mind

899
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,840
I don't know.

900
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,840
Every time I see you go by

901
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,280
All right.

902
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,080
I lose track of the minutes, the hours

903
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,960
Days go by with the sun

904
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,520
I feel how my heart dances

905
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,440
I don't want to lose you

906
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,040
I want to be with you

907
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,280
Tell me that you love me

908
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,880
Sing the song

909
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,000
If you say yes

910
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,120
I say no

911
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,360
If I say no

912
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,360
I say yes

913
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,600
Nothing can come between us

914
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,080
I knew it when I met you

915
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,040
I knew it when I met you

916
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,560
I knew it when I met you

917
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,720
I say no.

918
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,280
You're the star of all my dreams

919
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,360
I don't know how to hide it anymore

920
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,360
Here I am

921
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,240
-Here you are
-You're not going anywhere

922
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,000
It's not like you promised me the moon

923
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,520
Or dried the seas up

924
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,040
I don't want to lose you

925
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,560
I want to be with you

926
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,640
Tell me that you love me

927
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,360
Sing the song

928
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,920
If you say yes

929
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,600
I say no

930
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,760
If I say no

931
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,040
I say yes

932
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,600
Nothing can come between us

933
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,800
I knew it when I met you

934
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,120
I knew it when I met you

935
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,640
I knew it when I met you

936
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,320
What a lovely song.

937
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,200
What a lovely shirt you're wearing.

938
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,720
This? It was you, right?

939
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,520
What are you talking about?

940
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,440
-A waiter got me all wet.
-No!

941
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,440
You got wet?

942
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,400
Yes, and when I come back,
I find you playing the ukulele.

943
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,560
Yes, I borrowed it from the guys.

944
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,240
-And we started singing.
-Please, don't start arguing.

945
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,040
We are not arguing. He started it.

946
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,920
-Aren't you ashamed?
-Of what?

947
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,280
-You think Mía likes you. Is that it?
-No, she likes you, right?

948
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,240
We were singing and you appeared.

949
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,800
Where's Mía?

950
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,720
You're selfish
and you always blame other people.

951
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,360
And what about you?
Always the best, like no other.

952
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,280
You never judge yourself.

953
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,080
Can we talk, Mía?

954
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,600
Can't you just leave her alone?
Just for a second.

955
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,000
I can't stand this anymore.
I want to be relaxing at the hotel

956
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,720
and thinking about
the New Year's Eve party.

957
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,600
Now you want to leave because of him?

958
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,520
What did I do?

959
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,320
-It's your fault.
-My fault?

960
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,240
Yes!

961
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,000
-Mercedes!
-No!

962
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,960
Hide in there!

963
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,520
Hide!

964
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,760
Forget it, Mom. You've looked for him
everywhere. Can we go?

965
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,160
They have to be somewhere.

966
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,800
Let's wait for them at the hotel.

967
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,760
Can we leave?

968
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,360
Yes, I think that's best.

969
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,720
Your father will learn
what kind of daughter he has.

970
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,680
Let's go.

971
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,880
Don't move.

972
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,440
Let's see.

973
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,440
-Is she there?
-Has she left?

974
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,160
-Let's see.
-Is she gone?

975
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,240
-Madam.
-What? I'm no madam.

976
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,880
May I take a picture with your daughter?
She sang great.

977
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,120
He's my fan!

978
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,640
I want to be in the picture, I'm her PR.

979
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,960
I can't believe it.

980
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,120
Is she gone or not?

981
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,440
-Look.
-No.

982
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,120
-No.
-The boat is moving.

983
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,040
Is it?

984
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,040
Hold on.

985
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,960
Wait.

986
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,760
-No!
-What?

987
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,080
-Look!
-What?

988
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,520
-No.
-No.

989
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,880
How will we get back now?

990
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,440
Juanma, grab the oars.

991
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,360
What oars?

992
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,320
No, this is not over yet.

993
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,440
Mercedes won't stop
until Álvaro and Mía show up.

994
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,360
But can we just relax for a second
until she shows up?

995
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,240
Okay, let's go to Mía's room then
just to check.

996
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
This is insane.

997
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,480
Mía hasn't gone anywhere.
She's in her room.

998
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,000
-I saw her.
-Let's check.

999
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,640
-He's coming.
-Is Mía in her room?

1000
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,400
-Is she there or not?
-Yes, she is.

1001
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,040
-Why did you say that?
-Because I'm weak.

1002
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,560
-I know.
-What do we do now?

1003
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,920
Got it. I left the window open.
I'll get in the bed.

1004
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,240
You distract them.

1005
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,240
-Okay. I always get the worst part.
-Good luck.

1006
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,880
-Can you calm down?
-Where are you hiding, Álvaro?

1007
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,800
She needs to rest, Mercedes.

1008
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,920
Simón, get out of my way. Álvaro!

1009
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,560
-Son!
-Don't strain yourself!

1010
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,840
Mercedes!

1011
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,280
Mía.

1012
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,040
Is it time for breakfast?

1013
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,560
What are you doing here, Mía?

1014
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,680
Where would she be if not here?

1015
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,920
In her bed.

1016
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,400
But you told me--

1017
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,840
That Álvaro was at Jesse &amp; Joy's party.
I didn't say that Mía was with him.

1018
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,440
Don't say a word, Ramiro.

1019
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,440
What's going on? What's all that yelling?

1020
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,520
Where on earth have you been?

1021
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,720
At Jesse &amp; Joy's party.
Didn't Nico tell you?

1022
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,040
Please, Mercedes, leave us alone.

1023
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,360
Please.

1024
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,040
-Mía! My dear friend!
-Hi!

1025
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,920
-You're fine.
-Yes, I am.

1026
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,120
You may fool Mercedes,

1027
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,760
but you won't fool me.

1028
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,080
We're going to have a talk.

1029
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,440
Mercedes.

1030
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,320
Ramiro and his new daughter
managed to ruin the New Year for me.

1031
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,280
I should have left
the moment I saw them here.

1032
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,280
What happened?

1033
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,840
The same as always.

1034
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,320
Ramiro defends Mía.

1035
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,600
What about Lupe?

1036
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,160
We just forget about her?

1037
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,680
That's why she acts the way she does.

1038
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,160
She feels uncared for.

1039
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,840
Are you taking care of her?

1040
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,120
When will you tell her the truth?

1041
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,720
Are you taking Ramiro's side?

1042
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,600
It's not about taking sides.

1043
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,760
You and Ramiro are the ones
with the problems. Solve them.

1044
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,680
The kids don't deserve
to spend the New Year like this.

1045
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,920
Come on.

1046
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,360
Don't tell me. Mía asked you to come.

1047
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,880
We're doing everything wrong.

1048
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,520
Everything.

1049
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,600
Have you ever considered what she wants,
what she needs?

1050
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,880
I think she needs some peace.

1051
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,520
She's not enjoying this.

1052
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
-Me neither.
-You think I am?

1053
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,880
You know what?

1054
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,160
I think that you and I have
quite a lot in common.

1055
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,600
The thing is...
we started off on the wrong foot.

1056
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,680
Yeah.

1057
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,520
How about we start over?

1058
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,120
We can try.

1059
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,560
Everything looks so pretty!

1060
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,800
-This place is so amazing.
-Yes.

1061
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,600
Yes, but we're spending
New Year's Eve separated.

1062
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,400
You know how Mercedes is.
You can't change that.

1063
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,160
The important thing here
is that we are together, the three of us.

1064
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,440
And you're the best friends in the world.

1065
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,760
Yes, the ones who cover for you
when you sneak off to a party

1066
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,080
in the middle of nowhere
with Juanma and Álvaro.

1067
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,000
I'm sorry, Dad.

1068
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,400
It was unfair of me.

1069
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,960
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1070
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,200
And I shouldn't have gone
without permission.

1071
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,440
I'm sorry.

1072
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,960
Let me take a look at you.
You look gorgeous.

1073
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,600
Now, let's enjoy our first New Year's Eve
together.

1074
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,520
All right?

1075
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,280
I love you.

1076
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,240
Nico, can you ask Álvaro
to pass the salt?

1077
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,560
Tell him to get it himself.

1078
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,840
Can't you leave me alone just for today?

1079
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,520
We're kidding!

1080
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,800
I prefer it when you're fighting.

1081
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,920
Juanma, thank you
for everything you did.

1082
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,080
Álvaro,

1083
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,360
you're the best.

1084
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,360
No, you are.

1085
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,920
No, you are!

1086
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,920
Okay, I'm the best.

1087
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,680
Where are you going?

1088
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,240
To say hi to Ramiro.
And you should say hi to your dad.

1089
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,160
Shall we?

1090
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,000
You should come too, Mom.

1091
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,640
Shall we, Agus?

1092
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,320
Álvaro is right.

1093
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,720
We can't start the new year this way.

1094
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,800
Let's go.

1095
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,200
So nice!

1096
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,880
It's a great game.

1097
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,400
I'd like to make a toast.

1098
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,920
I've always dreamed
of a New Year's Eve like this.

1099
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,440
With my family.

1100
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,440
We're having a great time.

1101
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,840
And I can't help thinking
that we lived this year to the fullest.

1102
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,440
And the most important thing
is that we learned to love one another.

1103
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm sure that in this new year
that's beginning,

1104
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,120
we'll make our dreams come true.

1105
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,680
-Well said.
-Yes!

1106
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,880
I'll drink to that, too.

1107
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,240
-That's great.
-Awesome.

1108
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,320
-Fantastic.
-Cheers!

1109
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,000
-What time is it?
-Ten seconds to midnight!

1110
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,800
Ten, nine,

1111
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,440
eight, seven, six,

1112
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,800
five, four,

1113
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,960
three, two, one!

1114
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,560
Happy New Year!

1115
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,160
Happy New Year!

1116
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,320
Happy New Year, Dad.

1117
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,360
Happy New Year, honey. I love you.

1118
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,360
My dear daughter.

1119
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,880
Son.

1120
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,240
My friend!

1121
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,600
Happy New Year!

1122
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,800
I love you, guys.

1123
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,520
Happy New Year!

1124
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,000
My name is Giulia Be
and I have a surprise for you.

1125
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,800
The best group of the moment: GO!

1126
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,640
Let's go to the beach!

1127
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,960
Let's go!

1128
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,440
Three, two, one!

1129
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,440
I want you to want to toast with me

1130
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,280
I want to celebrate that we're alive

1131
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,440
I want to be happy

1132
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,800
I want to be here

1133
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,160
-Dance, dance with me
-I'm telling you

1134
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,680
Look at your footprint on the sand

1135
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,760
Let the sea take the bad things

1136
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,080
Everything will pass
Good things will come

1137
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,880
The sun will come up in the morning
As always

1138
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,360
It feels good

1139
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,800
When we are all here together

1140
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,040
Come, let's dance

1141
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,320
Let's turn it on

1142
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,280
Turn up the volume
Three, two, one, go!

1143
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,280
Turn up the volume
Three, two, one, go!

1144
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,640
I want you to want to toast with me

1145
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,200
I want to celebrate that we're alive

1146
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,440
I want to be happy
I want to be here

1147
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,640
Dance, dance with me

1148
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,720
I want you to want to toast with me

1149
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,240
I want to celebrate that we're alive

1150
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,760
I want to be happy
I want to be here

1151
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,760
Dance, dance with me

1152
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,520
A new year
A blank page

1153
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,360
I'll start from scratch
And learn from my failures

1154
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,760
I'm stronger now
The music keeps going

1155
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,240
I want you to come with me
So you know how it feels

1156
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,800
-I want to be happy
-I want to be here

1157
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,680
I want all our dreams to come true

1158
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,720
I know they will

1159
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,480
Let the music unite us
And bring out the best in you

1160
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,320
I'm telling you
It's time to do things my own way

1161
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,920
No more grief or sorrow

1162
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,960
Everything will pass
Good things will come

1163
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,640
We'll celebrate until night falls

1164
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,600
Follow my flow
Feel the dembow

1165
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,280
-It's a song
-Three, two, one, go!

1166
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,600
Come and dance with me
Music is passion

1167
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,280
Feel the drums beating in your heart

1168
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,640
It's a strong beat

1169
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,040
Don't deny it

1170
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,600
You already feel it

1171
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,280
Your heart is beating hard

1172
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,440
I want you to want to toast with me

1173
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,120
I want to celebrate that we're alive

1174
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,440
I want to be happy
I want to be here

1175
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,520
Dance, dance with me

1176
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,680
I want you to want to toast with me

1177
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,120
I want to celebrate that we're alive

1178
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,600
I want to be happy
I want to be here

1179
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,440
Dance, dance with me

1180
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,720
I want you to want to toast with me

1181
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,160
I want to celebrate that we're alive

1182
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,560
I want to be happy
I want to be here

1183
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,720
Dance, dance with me

1184
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,560
Like I said at the start,

1185
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,400
I've often dreamed
of a New Year like this.

1186
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,400
With my father,

1187
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,160
with my friends,

1188
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,960
and surrounded by music.

1189
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,440
But now, just you and I know
what could happen.

1190
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,400
We both know it

1191
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,120
Each to their own game

1192
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,960
I don't know if it was fate or our paths
That brought us together

1193
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,720
We both know it

1194
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,200
We are what we do

1195
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,800
And there's no hatred
That can't be changed with love

1196
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,360
Love, love, love

1197
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,720
We both know it

1198
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,040
Each to their own game

1199
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,000
I don't know if it was fate or our paths
That brought us together

1200
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,720
We both know it

1201
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,200
We are what we do

1202
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,800
And there's no hatred
That can't be changed with love

1203
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,720
Love, love, love
