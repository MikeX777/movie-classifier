Listen, Thomas,
what you're proposing,

36
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:04,505
however clickable,
doesn't really feel like news,

37
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,008
and that remains
our first obligation.

38
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,341
Now, we understand

39
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,644
we're getting clobbered
on physical,

40
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,814
but we need to use the election
as a barometer.

41
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,382
If paper doesn't start moving
in six months,

42
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,585
then we'll know the jig is up.

43
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,353
But we have to follow
the rules now.

44
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:24,158
It's a new age and that's not
what I'm fighting here.

45
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:27,762
I've been around long enough
to recognize a sea change

46
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:32,399
but we have to be able
to do our job.

47
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,969
Okay, so let's please move on
so we can get to

48
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,005
the very important work
I know you all have.

49
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,674
Gil.

50
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,176
- You say it was a heavy
night...

51
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,278
Sorry to interrupt.

52
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,147
Toby.

53
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,850
I need to talk to Marissa.

54
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,652
Something, uh...

55
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,154
-What's going on?
-Something's, uh...

56
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,622
Something's come up.

57
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:02,263
Okay, um, back to business.

58
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,998
Gil, what you got?

59
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,398
Homicide in Arbor Hill.

60
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,768
A young kid gunned down
in the middle of the road.

61
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,037
The name of the victim
not released yet.

62
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:12,607
The neighbor said they saw
the perp run away after.

63
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,800
You can't blame yourself
for this, Mom.

64
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,502
Hmm.

65
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:35,656
We're gathered here
to mourn such a sudden loss.

66
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,059
We pray that this family
might find peace

67
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:42,063
in the promise of God's
almighty kingdom.

68
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:44,532
And while there are no words
which can undo

69
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:48,302
the anger and the despair
of such a tragedy,

70
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,771
we pray that
those who have gathered

71
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,607
show this grieving family

72
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,476
that they are not alone
in their sorrow,

73
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,681
that the son we have lost
is surrounded by love.

74
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:05,553
Now, in such tragic
circumstances,

75
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,189
we are sometimes
tempted by rage

76
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,591
to dismiss God's plan,

77
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,593
to lose our own place

78
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,162
-within his mercy.
-It's not worth it.

79
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:16,797
But we must remember

80
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,498
- that death...
- You knew she'd be here.

81
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,968
is but another step
closer to God.

82
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,109
Hey, thanks.

83
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,510
Yeah.

84
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,379
Thank you.

85
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:34,515
Thanks so much for coming.

86
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,518
Thank you.

87
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,090
Mrs. Bennings.

88
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,625
I'm pregnant.

89
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,395
Mom. What the fuck
are you doing?

90
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:07,314
I'm sorry I hit you.

91
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,183
I wouldn't if I'd known.

92
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,452
Yeah. I know.

93
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,921
Just because of your condition,
doesn't mean...

94
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,490
Look, you don't need
to like me.

95
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:20,694
Just this weird,
shriveled little person.

96
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,297
You sure it's his?

97
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,634
Yeah, unless someone snuck into
my pussy and forgot it there.

98
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,672
You know I didn't
make him a junkie.

99
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,973
No, I don't know that.

100
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,242
I know you made him a thief.

101
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:37,711
He'd never stolen anything
from me in his life before you.

102
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,713
Is this really
about the Vitamix?

103
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:40,981
No, it's about the lying,

104
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:43,484
stealing money, jewelry,
and then the Vitamix.

105
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,119
He gave that to me
for my 40th birthday.

106
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,287
You never used it.

107
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,721
And you did?

108
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,864
How was he living?

109
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,135
We got our own place
to get clean.

110
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,105
He'd been having
these freak-outs

111
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:05,706
and getting really sick.

112
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,141
And he was scared.

113
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,811
Was he still dealing?

114
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,547
Well, that's the thing.
He had stopped.

115
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:14,048
When all that tainted shit
came through here,

116
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,749
he decided it was time
to get away.

117
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:19,053
He was looking to buy
this place near Chatham.

118
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,988
He was excited
to start a family.

119
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,123
To buy a place?

120
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:23,958
How was he gonna afford
to buy a place?

121
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,293
Well, he said Ducky and him
had it all figured out.

122
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,530
He was still hanging out
with Ducky?

123
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,831
Oh, yeah. He's like a brother.

124
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,266
To both of us.

125
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:42,810
Look, I didn't come here
to argue or beg or wh-whatever.

126
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,045
I'm here because
I loved Michael

127
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,848
and I'm sad he's gone,
and I know that you are, too.

128
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,585
Even if you're only capable
of being mad right now,

129
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:51,952

Three more strikes,
that's all you need.

143
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,895
You got it, Mike.
One ball at a time.

144
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:44,365
Aw.

145
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:47,768
That's okay, kiddo.
That was a good pitch.

146
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,582
Who do you think did it?

147
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,817
Well...

148
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:40,020
we got a lead,
but I don't think

149
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:42,856
that's what you should be
thinking about right now.

150
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,061
Ugh.

151
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:48,896
Okay.

152
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,433
You remember
Mike's friend Ducky?

153
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,934
Everett Duchowski?

154
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,836
Yeah, of course.

155
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,471
Well, at this point,
we're pretty certain

156
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,541
Everett's responsible
for bringing fentanyl

157
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:01,075
to the South End.

158
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:03,110
That shit is brutal.

159
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,313
Junkies who get tied up in it
don't last long,

160
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,549
one way or another.

161
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,286
So...

162
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,689
Michael was tied up in it?

163
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,560
We think him and Ducky might
have been in business together,

164
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,861
selling this
Mother's Milk shit,

165
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,063
heroin cut with fentanyl.

166
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:25,466
Maybe there was a fight
between them

167
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,068
or a deal gone wrong.

168
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,771
What makes you think that?

169
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:31,105
Mike was killed up the block

170
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,273
from one of Ducky's
stash houses,

171
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,076
and he matches the description
from a neighbor.

172
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,479
When was the last time
you saw him?

173
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:40,114
Mike.

174
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,616
I don't know.

175
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:46,186
Three, four months ago, maybe.

176
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,656
Well, you got me beat.

177
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,644
Jesus, you still haven't
thrown that thing out yet?

178
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,180
It helps.

179
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,116
I figured it'd make it harder.

180
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:19,654
Not if you don't carry a light.

181
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:23,658
All right,
give me a fucking drag.

182
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,666
Mmm.

183
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,301
Wow.

184
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,104
Pretending kind of does help.

185
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,209
I'll get Ducky.

186
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:44,546
I promise.

187
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,750
Come in.

188
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:29,122
Marissa.

189
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,692
What are you doing here?

190
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,761
Just wanted to make sure you
weren't too buried without me.

191
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:39,099
Yeah, um...
everything's going okay.

192
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,068
That's great.

193
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:43,337
Uh...

194
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:47,174
We weren't expecting you back
for a month at least.

195
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,045
How are you holding up?

196
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,549
I want to come back to work.

197
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:01,121
You took three months off
for Frank.

198
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,957
Yeah, that was different.

199
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,392
I need to come back.

200
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,630
And tell me what that
looks like to you.

201
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,500
Same thing as it did before.

202
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,336
You hate editing.

203
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,174
Walk out there right now,
and look at the ship

204
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,076
that Barry's been running
since you've been gone.

205
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,779
Fucking Barry?

206
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,650
What, you turn the A&C section
into a donkey show?

207
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,652
Okay, let's take a sec here.

208
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:34,656
You hate Barry
and all those guys out there.

209
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,156
Why?

210
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,660
Because they aren't writers.

211
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,963
They're all about numbers
and formatting

212
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,732
and words per click
or whatever.

213
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:48,101
Hell, you barely know
what the Internet does.

214
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,172
Marissa, you are
my best writer,

215
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,709
but for some reason,
you refuse to write.

216
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,912
Take your time...

217
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:00,615
but write.

218
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:18,600
All right.

219
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,100
Clean.

220
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,102
Bullshit.
It's touching my ball.

221
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:24,438
Watch and learn, sucker.

222
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,542
Lucky.

223
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,010
I learned from the best.

224
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,945
Another.

225
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,249
All right, your shot.

226
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,154
Gina didn't want to join?

227
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,524
She didn't want to intrude.

228
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,928
Said we should have
some alone time together...

229
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,863
to just grieve.

230
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:52,265
Is that what we're doing?

231
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,273
You gonna be okay, Mom?

232
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,910
One ball at a time.

233
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:57,165
Okay.

234
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,746
Upstairs to the left.

235
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:13,881
Let's make this quick.

236
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,893
Leather case.

237
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,700
It's got to be here somewhere.

238
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:49,416
Check the back room.

239
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,554
Fuck.

240
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,690
There.

241
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,401
What are you doing?

242
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,671
I always wanted to do that.

243
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,046
Seems weird, doesn't it?

244
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,114
What's that?

245
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,750
Paige said that Michael,
Ducky and her

246
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:35,056
were moving into a farm...
house or something in Chatham.

247
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,389
Mike?

248
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,025
A farmer?

249
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,597
I know. It doesn't make sense.

250
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:47,400
Listen, you got to be
careful with that girl.

251
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,677
What the fuck
are you doing here?

252
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,445
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

253
00:22:58,579 --> 00:22:59,947
Sorry. I meant to stay awake.

254
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:01,148
What are you doing here?

255
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:04,252
Someone broke into my house,
and-and I couldn't...

256
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:06,754
I-I just didn't have
anywhere else to go.

257
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:11,125
Were you hurt?
Did you see who it was?

258
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,861
No, but I found...
I found this.

259
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:18,666
Um, I think that's what
they were looking for.

260
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,302
I-I found it
right before they came in.

261
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:22,737
What is that?

262
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,607
That's about $50,000 worth
of dirty heroin.

263
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:43,557
I like the other way better.

264
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:45,526
Me, too.

265
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,862
This baby business is tough,

266
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,830
-but whatever works, right?
-Right.

267
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:00,174
How was she tonight?

268
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,143
Drunk.

269
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:04,645
Did she cry?

270
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,983
She said she'd already
cried for him.

271
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,551
The drinking isn't gonna help.

272
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,188
Remember how bad it got
after Frank?

273
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,991
Yeah. I definitely remember.

274
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:20,861
Hey, Mom. What's going on?

275
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:24,464
Yeah, I recognize the logo.

276
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,535
This is the shit
I was telling you about.

277
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,469
You're not gonna charge her,
right?

278
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,073
No.

279
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:35,242
You did the right thing.

280
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,112
-Is this everything?
-Everything?

281
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,582
Any chance you saw
the person who broke in?

282
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,884
No, I-I...
I got out pretty quick.

283
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:48,189
So, what does this mean?

284
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:50,490
-I'm gonna take this...
-This means shit just got real.

285
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,626
Somebody called him that night.

286
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,961
He left all freaked out.

287
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:55,930
I had no idea what
was going on, and then bam.

288
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,265
You know who called him, Paige?

289
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,601
It was Ducky.

290
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,207
All right?

291
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:08,976
We checked his phone.

292
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:14,015
Thank you, Paige. I'm gonna
take this to the station.

293
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:15,149
Okay?

294
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,762
I'll get you a blanket
for the couch.

295
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:30,564
Thank you.

296
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,087
Did my puking wake you up?

297
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,056
No.

298
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:57,258
You feeling any better?

299
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,160
Not at all.

300
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,664
Did you ever have
any weird cravings

301
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:05,099
when you were pregnant?

302
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,170
Necco Wafers.

303
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:10,738
The hell is a Necco Wafer?

304
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:13,240
It's, like, this little
disc-shaped candy.

305
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:16,610
You know? It has a...
It kind of tastes like chalk.

306
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:18,846
Must have eaten my body weight
in them.

307
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,082
I really want Play-Doh.

308
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,716
Play-Doh?

309
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,952
That can't be good
for the baby.

310
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,754
Kids eat it all the time,
and they're fine.

311
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:30,057
You should ask your doctor
about that.

312
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,029
Yeah.

313
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:37,798
You have a doctor, right?

314
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:41,102
Yeah, well, we went once
right when we found out,

315
00:26:41,135 --> 00:26:43,471
but the budget
was pretty tight, so...

316
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,674
We were... we were saving up
to go again.

317
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:49,810
Come on.
You need to see a doctor.

318
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:51,580
-What, right now?
-No.

319
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:52,880
Like a month ago.

320
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:55,316
But yeah, now is better
than later.

321
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:01,689
Uh, I have to stop by
work, but it won't take long.

322
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:05,359
I'll give you a ride home
when I'm done.

323
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:07,928
Depends on what you mean
by "home."

324
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:13,801
-I'll see you soon.
-See you.

325
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:16,804
Friday, 10:12 a.m.

326
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:19,306
Pick up the phone.

327
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,708
Come on.

328
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:24,311
I-I just wanted to say
that I figured some things out

329
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,714
and, um, I-I have a plan.

330
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:29,483
- Mmm.
- You know?

331
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:33,020
The things you said, they
made, they made sense. I...

332
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:38,926
I know that you were right
to kick me out of the house.

333
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,632
But, you know, a little bit
of fucking cash right now

334
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,666
would really go a long way
to getting...

335
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:48,936
I know you're in the house.

336
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,372
I can see you moving
in the house.

337
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,543
Let me in. It's my shit.

338
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:56,911
You changed
the fucking locks, Mom.

339
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:59,180
What the... Mom!

340
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:02,116
Hey, Mom, I don't expect you
to pick up this time.

341
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:05,654
I just wanted to say
♪ Happy birthday. ♪

342
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,054
Sorry, that's Paige.

343
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:11,091
Um, I want you to know
that we're doing a lot better.

344
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:14,929
Uh, there is something
I want to tell you in person.

345
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,932
I love you so much.

346
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:20,034
Bye.

347
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:40,054
You fucking serious?

348
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:45,192
Paige?

349
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,061
It's Gina.

350
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:48,095
Hey.

351
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:50,397
What are you doing here?

352
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:53,067
Um, same as me, I guess.

353
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:55,202
Marissa's supposed to be
picking me up.

354
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:56,270
Oh.

355
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:59,340
Do you mind if I join you?

356
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:01,442
Sure.

357
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,019
I like your necklace.

358
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,557
Stole it from Target.

359
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,493
Well, it suits you, I guess.

360
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:20,828
Thanks.

361
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,832
-I-I just mean...
-No, you're good.

362
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,601
I know what you meant.

363
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:28,603
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:33,073
Can I ask you a question?

365
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:35,943
What's it like
being married to a cop?

366
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,347
Uh, it's not so different
from anything else.

367
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,652
There's just a part of you
that accepts

368
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,786
he might not come home one day.

369
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:51,091
Sounds a lot like
dating an junkie.

370
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:57,699
She's not fucking coming.

371
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,567
I can give you a ride.

372
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,436
-You sure?
-Yeah, of course.

373
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,330
Didn't go so well at work, huh?

374
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,332
Sorry I forgot.

375
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,834
You had important things to do.

376
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,603
Stop it.

377
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:37,304
No, you fucking stop it.

378
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:38,305
Excuse me?

379
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,441
You just keep hiding
from everything, and it's

380
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:42,577
really fucking hard to look at.
It's shitty for all of us.

381
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,445
Just stop pretending
you're alone.

382
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,556
Well, I'm gonna go back
to Nar-Anon.

383
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:56,558
Well, that's a good start.

384
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,325
I'll come with you.

385
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,494
Make sure it's not
a drunk promise.

386
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:02,930
Mm.

387
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,647
For what it's worth,
Michael used to say

388
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,915
you were a really good writer.

389
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,319
Oh, yeah?

390
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,323
What else did he say?

391
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,030
He said that before Frank died
he remembers you were happy.

392
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,204
When did he say that?

393
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:45,607
All the time.

394
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,975
I wish I got to meet him.

395
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:51,478
No... no, you don't.

396
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:53,981
'Cause then you'd know
what an asshole he was.

397
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:56,383
Even when he got sick?

398
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,919
Especially when he got sick.

399
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:02,389
Yeah, but...

400
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,960
...did you ever stop
missing him?

401
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:12,099
Never.

402
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,939
Well, that's a drag.

403
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,645
Mm, God.

404
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:27,715
That's, uh... that's Toby.

405
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,918
-Oh, man.
-Look at his hair.

406
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,419
-Sweet.
-We should get you
one of these.

407
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:35,389
- Makes nursing easier.
- Yeah.

408
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:48,670
I'm going to bed.

409
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,572
Okay.

410
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:53,106
-Good night.
-Good night.

411
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:08,923
I think
I still have one of these

412
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,024
at the house,
believe it or not.

413
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,760
Mm-hmm.

414
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,295
Oh, hey. We could use these.

415
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,998
Especially if we
go with the pump.

416
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,501
Yeah.

417
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:21,970
Nothing?

418
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:25,272
Okay, well, I'm glad it's
my baby we're shopping for.

419
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,908
Oh, fuck yes!

420
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,910
Excuse me?

421
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,912
-We got a lead.
-A what?

422
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:32,780
We got a lead.

423
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:37,084
Let them do their investigation

424
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:38,553
but, in the meantime,

425
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,788
what could it hurt to hear
the story ourselves, you know?

426
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,857
I mean, maybe it will be the
same thing they told the cops,

427
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:44,559
but I want to hear it myself.

428
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:46,226
Listen, it's something
we can actually do

429
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,830
instead of sitting
around moping.

430
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,130
It's a lead.

431
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,866
You know,
this isn't ethical or legal.

432
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,635
Sure, it is.

433
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:12,587
- Hey.
- Jeremy?

434
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,721
Come on in.

435
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:17,190
I heard the shots but Jack
was the one who saw it.

436
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:20,160
He's a little out of it
from his meds, but...

437
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,162
Grandpa's up a lot
because of his hip.

438
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,631
He was sitting right there
when it happened.

439
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:27,167
Hi, Jack. Yeah, nice
to meet you. I'm-I'm Marissa.

440
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,303
I work for the "Times Union."

441
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:32,439
So you... so you saw
what happened?

442
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:36,276
Grandpa, you remember
what happened the other night?

443
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:39,212
Marissa's son was shot.

444
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,549
He was killed. Remember?

445
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,685
He was the one you saw die
in front of the house.

446
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:45,653
That's too bad.

447
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:46,854
I'm sorry.

448
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:49,356
I thought you said he saw
what happened that night.

449
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,659
-Come on. Nothing?
-Paige, hey.

450
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,628
Jack, just-just think.
Please, just think.

451
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,563
-Let's not be rude.
-I'm not being rude.

452
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:58,933
Grandpa, you said there
was someone outside yelling

453
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,400
-and then...
-With the truck?

454
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,870
Yeah, with the truck.

455
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,275
The boy was standing
in the street

456
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:09,978
yelling his head off.

457
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:12,580
Then I heard the truck.

458
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:16,283
I think the kid he was
calling for lives there

459
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,952
'cause I seen him there before.

460
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:20,420
Ducky!

461
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:33,835
I hope that was helpful.

462
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,578
Hey, Laurie.

463
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,080
Hey.

464
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:21,214
How you been?

465
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:22,617
Just getting by.

466
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,987
Thank you
for being here, everyone.

467
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,922
Come.

468
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,524
Come into the circle.

469
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:30,625
Have a seat.

470
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:32,660
It's a sunny day,
and we're all in a basement,

471
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:37,297
but we're gonna get to know
each other and talk.

472
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,001
I see some new faces.

473
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,201
Welcome.

474
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:45,205
And some who we haven't seen
for a while.

475
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:47,274
It's good to have you back.

476
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:49,644
Our, uh...

477
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,412
We had you in our prayers.

478
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,116
Uh, okay.

479
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:58,452
So, who wants
to start us off today?

480
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:03,024
Any thoughts? Any...

481
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:05,893
Oh. Laurie.

482
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:10,297
I lost my daughter...

483
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:15,402
Jessica, about, uh,
three months ago now.

484
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:19,674
Haven't...

485
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:22,543
Haven't really felt capable
of sharing

486
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,779
too much about it until now.

487
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,982
Sure a lot of you
know the feeling.

488
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,518
Mm...

489
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:34,956
Jessica was
a hard kid to raise.

490
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:40,962
I think sometimes
we paint our kids as saints.

491
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,001
Jessica was not a saint.

492
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,569
The opposite. She was...

493
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:51,739
She was kind of
a pain in the ass.

494
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:56,577
So, anyway, uh,
the morning I found her,

495
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:58,278
I was about to go to work,

496
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:01,015
so I went to her room
to wake her up.

497
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:17,598
You don't...

498
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:21,334
You don't realize it
at the time,

499
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:24,639
but that walk to the door
is the last time

500
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:28,341
you are who you think you are.

501
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,947
But you don't know.

502
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,348
I didn't know.

503
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:40,955
So I open the door,
and there she is,

504
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:44,091
laying on the bed,
fully clothed,

505
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,794
candles lit around her.

506
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:51,999
At first, I was furious,
you know?

507
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:56,571
I mean, she had fallen asleep
with candles burning,

508
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:58,873
and I start screaming at her.

509
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,473
"Are you crazy?

510
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,110
You're going to burn
the house down."

511
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:13,221
And then I see it:

512
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:17,457
it's a tiny little bag
on the carpet.

513
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,428
And I... I just look at it.

514
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,133
I remember the logo on the bag.

515
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,704
It's seared into my head,
you know?

516
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,574
"MM."

517
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:37,111
When you see
something like that,

518
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:40,114
you know, everything cracks.

519
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:43,618
The stories you made crack.

520
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:47,154
Who you thought your kid was
cracks.

521
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:50,124
Who you thought you were...

522
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:52,492
cracks.

523
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:55,162
You're that family now.

524
00:39:56,764 --> 00:40:00,534
You never realized
you were that family.

525
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,790
Hey. I'm gonna walk back.

526
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,826
You should offer Laurie a ride.

527
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,529
Oh. Pretty sure
she wants to be left alone.

528
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:30,564
No, that's what you want.

529
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:33,801
I'm gonna check
some of Ducky's spots.

530
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:49,250
Hey, Laurie. Hey.

531
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:50,518
Marissa.

532
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,586
Uh, do you want a ride?

533
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:27,221
Can't believe I'm actually
gonna ask this, but...

534
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,858
...could I interview you?

535
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:32,693
Interview me?

536
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:36,097
You, uh, put some things
into words

537
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,165
I haven't been able to yet.

538
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,268
You know all that stuff
is confidential, right?

539
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,304
Yeah, o-of course.

540
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:44,472
Uh, that's the point.

541
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,307
I want you to talk to me
on the record.

542
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,775
You know, mom to mom.

543
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:49,276
For what?

544
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:53,781
Uh, well, I don't know yet,

545
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:58,052
but maybe if I write it,
I'll know?

546
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,622
Thanks again.

547
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:03,891
Hey, uh, what's going on here?

548
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:09,630
This is a safe injection site
and needle exchange for users.

549
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:11,065
What?

550
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:14,168
Maybe if my baby had gone
to one of these

551
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:18,539
instead of hiding in her room,
she wouldn't have died.

552
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:22,209
This at least takes
that danger away.

553
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,115
You should come check it out.

554
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:32,853
If helping and healing
is actually what you want,

555
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:36,190
you really need to see it
for what it is.

556
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:07,188
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

557
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,333
Hey, John. Hey, Diane.

558
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:22,403
Marissa, this is Diane.

559
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,573
She, uh, coordinates
the distribution

560
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:27,775
of fentanyl test strips.

561
00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:31,580
Tells me where to go,
how to help,

562
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:33,814
how to stay out of the...

563
00:43:33,848 --> 00:43:35,416
Wait, are you okay?

564
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,551
Marissa?

565
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:39,186
Uh, excuse me.

566
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,698
If you're
looking for Toby Bennings,

567
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,466
leave a message.

568
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,268
Ducky! Ducky!

569
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,170
I just want to talk to you!

570
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:14,421
Ducky!

571
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:01,228
-Paige.
-Hey.

572
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:04,064
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah.

573
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:05,899
Yeah, everything's cool. Sorry.

574
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,769
I just came by
to talk to Gina, actually.

575
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:12,840
Uh... she went out
with some friends after work,

576
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,209
so she's not gonna be back
till later.

577
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:16,678
Oh, okay. Word.

578
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:18,479
Sorry for being creepy.

579
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:20,682
I just thought it might be nice
to talk to someone

580
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:22,717
who doesn't actually
feel like a parent

581
00:46:22,751 --> 00:46:24,619
and, like,
has their shit together.

582
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:26,020
Yeah, I get you.

583
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:27,121
I'll tell her you stopped by.

584
00:46:27,154 --> 00:46:29,890
-Okay. See you.
-Have a good night.

585
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:36,397
Uh, Paige, if you want,
you can come in.

586
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,265
-Yeah?
-In a way,

587
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,934
we're kind of family now.

588
00:46:41,703 --> 00:46:44,004
So... come on.

589
00:47:14,803 --> 00:47:17,237
Fuck. You're alive.

590
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:19,840
I thought I killed you.

591
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,545
What the fuck are you doing
following me?

592
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:26,614
You killed my son.

593
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:28,550
No, I fucking didn't.

594
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:31,051
You fucking believe that shit?

595
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:36,290
So what happened, then?

596
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:40,327
What happened, Ducky?

597
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,963
Look, all I know is
somebody called me

598
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:44,733
and told me
Mike was in trouble.

599
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:47,167
That he needed to get
out of his house.

600
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,169
So I called him and I told him

601
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,472
to meet me at the squat house
right away.

602
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:53,173
I thought I was protecting him.

603
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:54,942
What the fuck would you do?

604
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:56,644
I didn't know they were
gonna fucking kill him.

605
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:57,846
That's convenient.

606
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,147
No, it sucks, Mrs. Bennings.

607
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:03,651
Fucking best friend.

608
00:48:03,685 --> 00:48:05,486
Then who killed him?

609
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:09,791
I never met the guy,

610
00:48:09,824 --> 00:48:11,559
but he drives around
in his white truck

611
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:15,195
and has some fucking
stupid tattoo on his hand.

612
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:16,664
That's all I know.

613
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,935
Nobody fucking believes me.

614
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,904
Who's in there?

615
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:26,006
- Ducky!
- Hey, you!

616
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,242
What are you doing in there?!

617
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:37,585
Holy shit, Mom.

618
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,086
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

619
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,954
- I just need to talk to you.
- Fuck.

620
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:42,356
Marissa, what happened?

621
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:46,960
I, uh...

622
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:48,962
found your friend Ducky.

623
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:51,131
- What?
- Yeah.

624
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:54,368
Yeah, he was at the food bank.

625
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:56,704
I, uh, followed him
to the train yard

626
00:48:56,738 --> 00:48:58,439
down on Church Street.

627
00:48:58,472 --> 00:48:59,373
You followed him?

628
00:48:59,406 --> 00:49:02,142
And he snuck up,
hit me with something.

629
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:03,611
He could've killed you, Mom.

630
00:49:03,745 --> 00:49:04,913
I hoped he'd talk to me.

631
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:06,681
Talk to you?

632
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:10,451
You got any whiskey?

633
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,985
I'm gonna go out
and look for him.

634
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,521
He can't have gotten far.

635
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:18,626
You sure it was him?

636
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:20,360
I'm sure.

637
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,029
Did he say anything?

638
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:25,132
He said it was a guy
with a tattoo on his hand,

639
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:26,568
that he didn't do it.

640
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:28,837
No shit, he didn't do it.
He's not a fucking murderer.

641
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,638
You expect me to believe
that the man

642
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:33,675
who just knocked me unconscious
isn't a violent person?

643
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,677
What would you do if someone
followed you like that?

644
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,244
You really don't understand.

645
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:38,746
He told Mike to meet him there.

646
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:40,748
He set him up, Paige.

647
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,611
Ducky!

648
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:24,652
Ducky!

649
00:51:36,064 --> 00:51:37,799
Hello?

650
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:04,324
Ducky!

651
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:21,776
Ducky?

652
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:25,099
Hey. Sorry, I was downstairs.

653
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:26,299
Can I come inside?

654
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:28,770
Uh, yeah. Okay.

655
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,608
What's happening?
You all right?

656
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:35,009
Ducky's dead.

657
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,779
Uh...

658
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:40,248
how do you know?

659
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,251
'Cause I-I went to their
old house and I found him.

660
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,052
He killed himself.

661
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:47,889
Fuck.

662
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:49,924
Okay. Uh...

663
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,993
Oh, God.

664
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:55,530
All right, uh, look.
Just sit down.

665
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:57,698
I'll get you some water.
Are you okay?

666
00:54:57,732 --> 00:54:59,366
Yeah.

667
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,373
Look, just have a drink,
take a few deep breaths.

668
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:12,513
Fuck.

669
00:55:13,514 --> 00:55:15,283
Was anyone else there?

670
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:18,186
No, it was just me
and-and, um...

671
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,723
Yeah, I-I saw his body,
and th-then I left.

672
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,357
Got it. Okay.

673
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:26,961
Uh, why didn't you call 911?

674
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:29,462
Because I knew I wasn't
supposed to be there.

675
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:30,798
I mean, yeah,
that's why I'm-I'm here.

676
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:32,567
-I knew that you could help.
-Sure.

677
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,003
I'm sorry. I'm really...
I'm sorry for your loss.

678
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:38,873
I'll get someone
to go around there right away.

679
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:43,376
You just take it easy and, uh,
make yourself at home.

680
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,213
-I'm just gonna be two minutes.
-Okay.

681
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:46,747
All right?

682
00:57:33,654 --> 00:57:34,989
...10-56.

683
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:37,224
And I need someone to go
to the address

684
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:39,760
and just check it out.

685
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:41,829
Right away.

686
00:57:43,097 --> 00:57:44,899
Yeah, it's a real mess...

687
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:46,667
I need someone to go

688
00:57:46,701 --> 00:57:49,870
to 125 Eagle
to check a possible 10-56.

689
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:52,239
I want to be kept in the loop.

690
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,976
Get put on the team, Mitch.

691
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,078
This one's personal.

692
00:58:14,395 --> 00:58:16,664
All right, thanks a lot.

693
00:59:23,998 --> 00:59:25,099
Paige?

694
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:04,405
-Paige, give me the phone.
-No. Get back.

695
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:05,873
-Just give me the phone.
-No. Back...

696
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,341
-Give me the phone.
-Back the fuck up.

697
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:08,409
-Paige.
-No.

698
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:17,785
Listen to me.

699
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:19,653
You don't understand
what's going on here.

700
01:00:19,687 --> 01:00:21,956
-Toby. No, just back up.
-Please.

701
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:22,857
I can explain.

702
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,025
-Back the fuck up.
-Listen to me.

703
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:26,494
-Just give me the phone.
-Back the fuck away.

704
01:00:26,528 --> 01:00:27,695
-I'm telling you.
-Back the fuck up.

705
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:28,829
I can explain.
I can explain this.

706
01:00:28,863 --> 01:00:30,965
Paige, just calm down.

707
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:33,134
-Just stop, okay?
-Get the fuck away from me.

708
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:35,035
-Calm down. Give me the phone.
-The fuck...

709
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:36,837
-Fuck you. Get the fuck away
from me.
-Wait. Paige...

710
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:38,439
-Just back the fuck up!
-Give me the phone.

711
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,509
Get out of my way!
Don't touch me.

712
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:41,876
-Get the fuck away! Don't...
-Just give me...

713
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,244
-Give me the fucking phone.
-Get the fuck off me!

714
01:00:43,277 --> 01:00:45,679
-Give me the phone! Paige.
-Get the fuck...

715
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:06,834
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

716
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:09,737
Paige. Paige. Hey.

717
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:11,939
Hey.

718
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:14,008
Oh, fuck.

719
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:17,011
Oh, fuck.

720
01:01:54,415 --> 01:01:56,317
Fuck.

721
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:06,755
Hey, I'm home.

722
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:09,356
Gina! Call an ambulance quick!

723
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,991
- What? What happened?
- Gina, it's Paige!

724
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:12,527
-Call an ambulance!
-What?

725
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,762
She fell in the bathroom.

726
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:16,096
I think she OD'd.
She's bleeding.

727
01:03:16,864 --> 01:03:18,533
Just get an ambulance
right now!

728
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,868
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

729
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:25,039
Hi, um...

730
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:27,241
Fuck. Fuck!

731
01:03:31,713 --> 01:03:32,880
Toby.

732
01:03:32,913 --> 01:03:34,649
I think Paige
is hiding something.

733
01:03:34,683 --> 01:03:36,317
Yeah. You're right.

734
01:03:36,618 --> 01:03:38,085
She's using again,

735
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:39,887
-and she overdosed.
-What?

736
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,489
She's on her way
to the hospital right now.

737
01:03:43,658 --> 01:03:45,359
Meet us at St. Peter's.

738
01:04:31,138 --> 01:04:34,274
Bring the forceps, please.

739
01:04:44,853 --> 01:04:47,655
Very nice. Here she is.

740
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,126

Hi, cat. This is a baby.

01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:36,183
Baby, this is a cat.

757
01:09:30,303 --> 01:09:32,840
Jesus Christ, you scared me.

758
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:34,474
Sorry. I let myself in.

759
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:36,811
You okay?

760
01:09:37,145 --> 01:09:38,680
It's a nice room.

761
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,382
Perfect for the little angel.

762
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:46,319
Got to get her her bottle.

763
01:09:46,954 --> 01:09:47,855
Here, come on.

764
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:51,191
Okay.

765
01:09:55,328 --> 01:09:57,297
There you go.

766
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:00,835
Yeah.

767
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:06,373
What's going on?

768
01:10:09,177 --> 01:10:10,945
I found something.

769
01:10:22,355 --> 01:10:26,194
Marissa, I found it under
the stairs in the basement.

770
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:29,329
I thought it was
some kind of miracle.

771
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:33,366
Like a gift left as a reminder.

772
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:35,136
But then I saw the blood.

773
01:10:35,368 --> 01:10:37,237
How... how d...

774
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,706
I don't know.

775
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:42,810
I've been trying to think
of every possible reason,

776
01:10:42,844 --> 01:10:44,344
and I...

777
01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:01,763
Have you asked him about it?

778
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:02,830
No.

779
01:11:04,297 --> 01:11:06,366
I can't find the words.

780
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:14,407
So what are you gonna do?

781
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:23,483
I don't know
what the right thing to do is.

782
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:27,588
I don't know
if I could do it anyways.

783
01:11:36,363 --> 01:11:38,365
I know. I feel guilty, too.

784
01:11:38,398 --> 01:11:40,067
We got a lead,
but I don't think

785
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:42,435
that's what you should be
thinking about right now.

786
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:44,404
Everett's responsible
for bringing fentanyl

787
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:45,673
to the South End.

788
01:11:45,706 --> 01:11:48,176
Mom, pick up the phone.

789
01:11:48,209 --> 01:11:49,442
Come on.

790
01:11:49,476 --> 01:11:51,813
Ducky's not getting away
with this shit.

791
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:55,415
We think him and Michael might
have been in business together.

792
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,952
Maybe there was
a dispute or something.

793
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:00,855
I don't expect you
to pick up this time.

794
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:03,658
There is something
I want to tell you in person.

795
01:12:04,692 --> 01:12:05,893
Okay, Mom.

796
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:08,296
Listen, you got to be
careful with that girl.

797
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:10,097
I love you so much.

798
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:11,265
Bye.

799
01:12:11,299 --> 01:12:13,835
You know who called him, Paige?

800
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,335
It was Ducky.

801
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:17,138
We checked his phone.

802
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:51,873
- Hi.
- She's sleeping.

803
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:56,443
You feeling okay, Mom?

804
01:12:58,478 --> 01:13:00,882
No. Not really.

805
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:06,153
Wow.

806
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:08,388
Haven't seen this thing
in years.

807
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:12,425
This was Dad's nicest suitcase.

808
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,263
And he covered it
in fucking stickers.

809
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:22,904
The stuff's in there.

810
01:13:30,443 --> 01:13:32,713
You think
that's what killed her?

811
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:41,789
Yeah, it seems like it.

812
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,528
They both had fentanyl in them.

813
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:55,536
Seriously, Mom,
you should go see a doctor.

814
01:13:58,572 --> 01:14:00,975
Yeah, I will.

815
01:14:03,476 --> 01:14:06,479
Okay. I tried.

816
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:29,650
Thank you.

817
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:31,152
I told you.

818
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:50,639
This is the Empire Line

819
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,406
running express
to Penn Station, New York City

820
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:55,510
with stops in Hudson,
Rhinecliff, Poughkeepsie,

821
01:17:55,544 --> 01:17:56,977
Croton-Harmon, Yonkers

822
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:00,881
with final stop New York City
Penn Station.

823
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:03,817
Please have your tickets ready
for the conductor

824
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:05,587
when he comes through.

825
01:20:53,954 --> 01:20:59,326
You remember when
Mike threw that perfect game

826
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,895
until the final inning,

827
01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:04,431
and then he gave it up
to a homer?

828
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:11,472
That was just his luck.

829
01:21:14,475 --> 01:21:17,244
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

830
01:21:19,179 --> 01:21:21,583
It was supposed to be simple.

831
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,986
When Mike found out
what was in it,

832
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:29,056
he wouldn't sell it
or give it back.

833
01:21:29,089 --> 01:21:32,025
What did he think
they were gonna do?

834
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:34,395
I guess that's my luck.

835
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:38,098
This doesn't have anything
to do with luck.

836
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,368
I'm scared, Mom.

837
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,310
Me, too.

838
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,770
My youngest son was born

839
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:50,170
to be an athlete.

840
01:22:50,204 --> 01:22:52,874
His older brother Toby started
hitting him ground balls

841
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:54,642
when he was two or three.

842
01:22:54,676 --> 01:22:56,911
The kid was good. So was Toby.

843
01:22:56,945 --> 01:22:58,913
But Michael had
something different.

844
01:22:58,947 --> 01:23:00,582
He had an arm.

845
01:23:00,615 --> 01:23:02,550
Oh, uh, just water and lime.

846
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:05,620
He threw
70 miles per hour by 14,

847
01:23:05,653 --> 01:23:09,156
and scouts started telling us
he had a real shot.

848
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:11,325
We had no idea what kind
of damage he was doing

849
01:23:11,358 --> 01:23:14,328
to the shoulder
of his throwing arm.

850
01:23:14,361 --> 01:23:17,431
Maybe we should've
made him stop.

851
01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:20,735
But by 15, he was being
medicated for pain management.

852
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:24,939
To say I didn't know any better
wouldn't be totally true.

853
01:23:24,973 --> 01:23:26,206
Thanks.

854
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,642
But I knew a kid shouldn't be

855
01:23:27,675 --> 01:23:29,443
in that much pain.

856
01:23:31,713 --> 01:23:34,549
Then I started seeing
his behavior changing.

857
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:38,318
Toby was a different story.

858
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:41,589
He was the one
we didn't have to worry about.

859
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:45,092
The civil servant,
the ambitious one.

860
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:48,061
That might be the only thing
I still recognize in him.

861
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:50,698
That toxic ambition.

862
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:54,301
As different as
Mike and Toby were,

863
01:23:54,669 --> 01:23:56,336
their lives stayed intertwined

864
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:59,239
more than they could ever
let me know.

865
01:24:09,383 --> 01:24:13,186
I assume you know
the implications of this.

866
01:24:15,289 --> 01:24:17,391
I know more than anyone.

867
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:21,896
Take a couple of days.

868
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:24,197
A week, whatever.

869
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:29,136
Take that time,

870
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:34,141
and if then you still
want to publish it,

871
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:36,611
I'll have your back.

872
01:24:52,527 --> 01:24:53,761
It's good.

873
01:25:26,193 --> 01:25:28,896
Thanks for letting us
have her for the day.

874
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,832
Can I take her?

875
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,501
Hello, baby.

876
01:25:35,103 --> 01:25:37,005
Hello, baby.

877
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:39,674
Are we gonna have
some fun today?

878
01:25:39,974 --> 01:25:41,843
Oh, yeah.

879
01:25:41,909 --> 01:25:43,711
Thanks, Mom. See you later.

880
01:25:46,213 --> 01:25:47,882
Baby.

881
01:25:49,517 --> 01:25:52,687
Let's do it.
Let's go have fun tonight.

882
01:26:04,264 --> 01:26:06,734
