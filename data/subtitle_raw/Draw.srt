who have left
a unique mark on the game

for the evolution of the game.

00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,418
They are the visionary icons

Chicharito, James and
the phenomenal Lionel Messi

00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:14,578
They are
the successors to legends

00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,618
who have long since
hung up their cleats.

40
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:53,258
if not the best,

When the world mentions football

47
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:25,154
all eyes turn to Brazil.

48
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,274
A nation with a unique fusion

49
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,634
of various cultures.

50
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:39,674
Brazilians didn't
invent the sport

51
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,594
but they were able
to make it their own.

52
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:43,954
They adopted its foundations

53
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:46,314
and now it's become
part of their DNA.

54
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:49,194
Two of the sport's
greatest players were born here

55
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,594
Edson Arantes Do Nascimento.

56
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:53,794
'Pele' is considered to be

57
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,274
the most important
player to have ever lived.

58
00:02:56,554 --> 00:03:00,154
And Neymar stands as Brazil's
most exciting prodigy today.

[fast-paced music]

60
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:11,314
Both began, like many in Brazil

61
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:14,554
by playing on dirt,
or rugged concrete surfaces.

62
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,554
And as fate would have it

63
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:18,554
neither
the pavement in the favelas

64
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,354
nor the indoor wooden pitches

65
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,074
could contain the grandiosity

66
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:24,394
of these two
rare-breed individuals.

67
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,154
They overcame
every single adversity

68
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,354
that crossed their path

69
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:30,714
on the road
to becoming national heroes.

[electronic music]

71
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,114
Pele was born in 1940

72
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:37,074
just south of Minas Gerais.

73
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:41,314
And Neymar was born in 1992

74
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:42,794
east of Sao Paulo.

75
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:47,754
Both stars born decades apart

76
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,274
began their journey
in Santos Football Club.

77
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,954
Even though the playing
field looked very different

78
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,394
on the dates of their arrival

79
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:55,994
the sentiment in the air

80
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,394
and passion for
the game remained unchanged.

81
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:01,634
Pele joined Santos in 1956

82
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:04,034
after being scouted
by former player

83
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,474
Waldemar de Brito.

84
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:09,594
Conversely, Neymar
was discovered during his time

85
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:13,314
practicing with the Portuguesa
Santista Futsal Academy.

[fast-paced music]

87
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:26,514
The 1940s and 1950s were years
of political tension in Brazil.

88
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,194
The nation was
finally able to rid itself

89
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:30,754
of a military dictatorship

90
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:32,114
that had deprived its people

91
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:34,034
of their freedoms
for many years.

92
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:36,154
The country's
economy began to boom

93
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:38,834
and the economic growth
seemed to spread everywhere

94
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,634
throughout the country,
except the favelas.

these two remarkable players

100

began developing
their skills and their swagger.

After a brief spell
in the Youth League

104
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:06,314
Pele joined Santos'
first team at the age of 15.

105
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:08,434
Pele's talent was undeniable.

106
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,554
His skills were so impressive

107
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:12,394
that at the mere age of 17

108
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:14,634
he was chosen
to form part of the team

109
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,674
that would represent Brazil in
the 1958 World Cup in Sweden.

110
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:22,074
But it was not
an entirely smooth experience.

111
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,434
Upon his arrival
with the national team

112
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:26,194
Pele was labeled as young

113
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:29,794
naive and inexperienced,
by the team psychologist.

114
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:32,434
However, Vicente Feola

115
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,754
coach of
the Scratch du Oro at the time

116
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:38,034
completely disregarded
the psychologist's diagnosis

117
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,794
and allowed the Brazilian star
to travel with the team.

118
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,634
Pele witnessed
Brazil's first game

119
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,234
of the tournament
from the bench.

120
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:47,994
His debut came later

121
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,114
during a match
against the Soviet Union.

122
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:54,914
Pele scored his first
World Cup goal against Wales.

123
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:57,714
That match did more
than Pele could fathom.

124
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:59,674
It instantly let the world know

125
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,554
that he was a force
to be reckoned with.

[fast-paced music]

127

where they faced
the hosts, Sweden.

129
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:10,714
This encounter
confirmed everything

130
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:12,514
that had been
predicted about Pele.

131
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:16,034
He scored two goals
that ultimately led Brazil

132
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:17,994
to their first
World Cup in history.

133
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:20,474
At 17 years old

Edson Arantes do Nascimento

135
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:24,874
became
an international celebrity.

136
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:31,634
At the same age

137
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,514
Neymar Junior debuted
in Brazil's First Division.

138
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:39,234
He was included in
Santos' first team in 2009.

139
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,834
Ney scored more than
40 goals in 60 games

140
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:45,434
and with his cheeky approach

141
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:49,634
he became a vital factor
in Santos' Campeonata Paulista

142
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,914
and the Copa do Brasil's
victorious campaigns.

143
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,474
Despite his
incredible accomplishments

144
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:59,674
Neymar was not
included in the 23-man roster

145
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,034
that would represent Brazil

146
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:03,074
during the World Cup
in South Africa.

147
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:07,194
Like Pele, Ney was labeled
as 'inexperienced' by Dunga

148
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,954
the national team's coach.

149
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:10,674
Dunga was later fired

150
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:13,154
for the team's poor
results during the tournament.

Months later,
with no obstacles in the way

153
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,314
Neymar had the opportunity

154
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:25,034
to make his first appearance
with the national team.

155
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,434
This took place
during a friendly match

156
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:29,234
versus the United States.

157
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,674
In 2010, Neymar's
exceptional achievements

158
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:35,314
earned him an invite
to the annual FIFA Gala

159
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:37,794
There, he received
the Puskas award

160
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,914
for scoring
the best goal of the year

161
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,514
and was also recognized as

162
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,634
the best South American
player of the year.

163
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,834
In 1962, at only 21 years of age

164
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:51,514
Pele was already considered

165
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:53,514
the best football
player on the planet.

166
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:56,994
He was indispensable for Brazil

167
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:59,834
and a fundamental part
of Santos' mid-field.

168
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:02,074
He made history with both teams

to have won the World Cup
on three occasions

176
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:24,434
and with Santos, he was able
to break the predominance

177
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:27,754
that the Argentine teams had
over the Brazilian squads.

178
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:29,834
They were able to defeat Boca

Copa Libertadores

never been replicated.

was cut short by modern times.

and sign a lavish contract
with the Catalan club in 2013.

But Ney's
new-found glory in Europe

192

did not side-track his
commitment

with the national team.

The game was
between his beloved Santos

and his current
home, the Cosmos.

one of the best
players in the world

213

such a coveted title

In 2017, he departed
from Barcelona's Camp Nou

Will Neymar Junior
live up to the King?

227

It is difficult
to draw a conclusion

228
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:37,634
based on leadership
and achievements at this time

229
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,434
as Ney is still very young.

230
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:43,034
And although they are
both extraordinary players

231
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:44,434
they have each taken on

232
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:46,434
two very different
roles on the pitch.

233
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,874
Pele played most of his career

234
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,194
as a withdrawn forward

235
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,834
or a center-attacking mid.

236
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:55,714
Neymar excels when he's
coming in from the left wing

237
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,714
but has also taken on
roles as a second striker

238
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:00,594
and as center forward
for Brazil.

239
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:02,274
He is extremely efficient

240
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,674
at destabilizing
the opponents' defense

241
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:06,794
making him extremely dangerous

242
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,274

than 80 appearances

with the national team

247
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:22,514
which places him very close
to matching Pele's record

248
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:25,394
of 72 goals in 92 matches.

249

it is unlikely for Neymar

00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,212
Hugo Sanchez
was just one year older

365
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:53,092
when he arrived in Europe
and joined Atletico Madrid

366
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:55,252
Sanchez had a tough time

367
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:58,092
adapting to the Spanish
team's rough ways of playing.

368
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:00,412
This was obvious
in his performance.

369
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:02,772
This incited a wave of criticism

370
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,652
from the Spanish press
who labeled the Mexican player

371
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,892
a total failure.

372
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:09,012
Sanchez remained driven.

373
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:11,132
He was not going
to let these obstacles

374
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:13,172
stand in the way
of him fulfilling his goal.

375
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:15,572
He was determined to succeed

376
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,772
outside of
his country's domestic league

377
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:20,892
and in the 1984 to 1985 season

378
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,412
the world began
to witness his grandiosity.

379
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:26,252
That year he was
a fundamental part

380
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:29,132
of the colchonero's triumph
in the Copa del Rey

381
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:31,052
and in the Spanish Super Cup

382
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,372
all while securing his place
as Pichichi of the league.

383
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:36,852
These successes
caught the attention

384
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,252
of Spanish super-club
and neighboring rival

385
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,492
Real Madrid.

386
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,852
[exciting music]

387
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:47,252
In 1985, 27-year old Sanchez
took the definitive step

388
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:50,252
that united him with
the victorious merengue side.

389
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,212
A fantastic group of players

390
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:59,132
known as La Quinta del Buitre

391
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,212
led by Emilio Butragueno

392
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:02,972
were waiting for Hugo's arrival

393
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,852
at the Santiago Bernabeu.

394
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,292
The lethal combination
of Hugol and La Quinta

395
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,332
established an unbeatable
dynasty in the Spanish League

396
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:14,092
that lasted for five years.

397
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:17,892
In four of them, Hugo was
named Pichichi of the league

398
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:21,332
and thus, the legend of
the PentaPichichi was born.

399
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:22,972
[explosion]

400
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:25,892
Chicharito's first year
in Europe was remarkable.

401
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,572
With the help of
his effectiveness

402
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,172
in crucial situations

403
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,812
Manchester United managed to win

404
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:33,212
the Premier League
and the Community Shield.

405
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:36,052
This earned him
the respect of his teammates

406
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:39,172
and above all, of
his coach, Sir Alex Ferguson.

407
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:43,492
[fast-paced music]

408
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,212
After four years at Manchester

409
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:47,572
Chicharito's stay
came to an end.

410
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,692
That summer, his nation
reached the round of 16

411
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:52,132
at the World Cup in Brazil

412
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,332
and subsequently, he became
the fourth Mexican in history

413
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:56,972
to sign with Real Madrid.

414
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:00,932
[music continues]

415
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,452
In 1992

416
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:11,892
Hugo Sanchez
departed Real Madrid

417
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,932
and embarked
on a four-year journey

418
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,372
through the leagues in Austria

419
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:18,372
the United States,
Spain, and Mexico.

420
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:25,532
In 1997, at the age of 39

421
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,732
he retired from
football in his homeland.

422
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:33,132
[electronic music]

423
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,812
Chicharito's fate
is very similar

424
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:41,212
to that of his predecessor.

425
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:43,452
When he departed Real Madrid

426
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,852
he took on a new
challenge in the Bundesliga.

427
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,732
During his two years
with Bayern Leverkusen

428
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:51,412
he scored a total of 39 goals.

429
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,372
In 2017

430
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,132
he made a return
to the Premier League

431
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,532
and joined his current club

432
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:57,852
West Ham United.

433
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:02,212
Hugo Sanchez and Javier
'el Chicharito' Hernandez

434
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,372
have become
legacies in their own right

435
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:06,452
but one thing sets them apart

436
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:09,092
the number of
goals each has scored.

437
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,532
During his 21-year career

438
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,332
Sanchez reached
the 500 goal milestone.

439
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,012
That number could
possibly outshine

440
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:18,652
Chicharito's accomplishments

441
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:23,172
as he has only scored around
190 goals at the age of 29.

442
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,812
Those numbers don't
dim Hernandez' talents

443
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:30,332
who has scored almost
50 goals for the Tri

444
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,572
making him Mexico's top scorer.

445
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,452
During his time,
Sanchez was only able

446
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:39,052
to score 29 goals
for the national team.

447
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:43,212
Hugo amazed the masses
with his bicycle kicks, volleys

448
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,532
and of course his
signature celebrations

449
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:46,812
that defied gravity.

450
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:50,612
[music continues]

451
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:56,212
Hernandez has been a quieter
and more reserved player

452
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:57,492
throughout his career.

453
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:00,932
Javier is used to defining
the final moments of every game

454
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,732
and has become
the last-minute hero

455
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:04,252
on multiple occasions.

456
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,772
Chicharito's weaknesses
were Sanchez' strengths.

457
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:11,092
His long-distance shots
gave him a clear advantage.

458
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:14,972
He was dangerous inside,
outside, and around the box

459
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:16,732
while Chicharito shines best

460
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:19,692
when he's receiving passes
from outside the penalty area.

461
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:23,692
Despite their differences
they are both considered

462
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:26,052
two of the best players
in Mexican history.

463
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:38,732
Although their
careers took similar paths

464
00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:40,372
the lives of these two athletes

465
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,332
could not have been
any more different.

466
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:47,372
Hugo Sanchez was one
of the first Mexican players

467
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:49,172
to market himself as an athlete.

468
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:51,932
He made appearances
in several commercials

469
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:53,892
talk shows
and advertizing campaigns

470
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,572
in Mexico and in Spain.

471
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:58,492
Sanchez embraced fame

472
00:21:58,652 --> 00:21:59,972
and lived for the crowds.

473
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:01,812
There's even
a street named after him

474
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:03,692
in the Mexican city of Puebla.

475
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,812
Football continues to hold
an important role in his life.

476
00:22:09,332 --> 00:22:12,132
He currently works as
a sports commentator in Mexico.

477
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,772
Chicharito, on the other hand,
is less of a protagonist

478
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:21,372
and prefers to use his fame
to support humanitarian causes.

479
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:27,092
In 2012, Hernandez was appointed
as a UNICEF ambassador.

480
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:30,692
He utilizes his fame to
support initiatives in Mexico

481
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:32,932
that's aimed to help
children living in poverty.

Colombia is a nation rich
in coffee, countryside and sea.

00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:57,522
A nation reborn from decades
of conflict and heartbreak.

485
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,122
Its people turn to music

486
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:03,242
art and football to find joy.

share something
that makes them great.

Carlos 'El Pibe' Valderrama

493
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:25,002
was born in 1961

494
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:27,042
in the coastal city
of Santa Marta.

495
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:29,322
And 29 years later

496
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:30,802
in the city of Cucuta

497
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:33,762
his successor,
James Rodriquez, was born.

498
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:42,162
Carlos Valderrama
was born into a humble family.

499
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,202
He played football
whenever he could

500
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:45,602
with his brothers and cousins.

501
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:50,282
But his natural talent quickly
set him apart from the rest.

[fast-paced music]

503
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:56,282
Football was also
a fundamental part

504
00:23:56,322 --> 00:23:58,482
of James Rodriquez' early life.

505
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:01,722
Everything in his life
revolved around a football.

506
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,922
Between the ages
of four and five

507
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:06,162
he joined
the Tolimense Youth Academy

508
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,482
and the course of
his life was transformed.

509
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:11,962
El Pibe signed his
first professional contract

510
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:13,402
with Union Magdalena

511
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:14,802
at the age of 19.

512
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:16,802
This marks
the beginning of the road

513
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:18,402
that would lead him
to become part of

514
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,322
the Milionarios de Bogota

515
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,002
and Deportivo Cali

the clubs where he demonstrated
his one-of-a-kind talent.

517
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,482
In 1987, he led the team
during their third-place finish

518
00:24:29,562 --> 00:24:32,162
at the Copa America
where he was recognized as

519

the best player
of the tournament.

[fast-paced music]

521
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:43,322
In 1988, his amazing skills and
intelligence as a mid-fielder

522
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,002
earned him a move
to the French League

523
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:46,482
playing for Montpellier.

524
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,562
James Rodriquez' encounter
with international football

525
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:55,762
arrived before
his 20th birthday.

526
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:59,002
He had already excelled
in Colombia's Primera B

527
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,042
and at just 15 years old

528
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,202
he became the youngest
player in Colombia's Under 17.

529
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:07,322
In 2005,
he was presented the opportunity

530
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:09,842
to show off his techniques
with the first team

531
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:11,642
at Envigado Futbol Club.

532
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:14,922
Three years later
James' impressive performance

533
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:16,882
allowed him to
demonstrate his skills

534
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:18,762
at Banfield in Buenos Aires.

535
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:21,402
Eight months later,
the Colombian superstar

536
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:23,282
became the youngest
foreign debutante

537
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:25,042
in the Argentine First Division.

string of accomplishments

Rodriquez caught the attention
of the old continent

541
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:40,322
especially of one of
the fiercest clubs in Portugal

542
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:41,722
Porto.

543
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:43,962
In 2010, at the age of 18

544
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:47,202
the Colombian mid-fielder
finalized his move to Europe.

[explosion]
[fast-paced music]

547
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:58,642
Unlike James, Valderrama's
consecration as a player

548
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:01,562
did not come until
after his 27th birthday.

549
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:06,642
In 1990, he was the strength
of Montpellier's mid-field

550
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:08,922
and a key player
in the French Cup victory.

551
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,962
But it was at that
year's World Cup in Italy

552
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:13,282
that Valderrama played

553
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:15,002
the best tournament of his life.

554
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:20,002
He led Colombia
to the round of 16

555
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,082
for the first time
in the country's history.

556
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:25,642
[exciting music]

557
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:31,842
After the World Cup

558
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:34,122
Valderrama searched
for new challenges

559
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:36,362
and he briefly
took his talents to Spain

560
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:37,882
where he joined Valladolid.

561
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:41,042
He returned home and helped
strengthen the national team

562
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,482
as they made their way
to the second World Cup.

563
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:47,002
[anticipatory music]

564
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,522
Colombia's
demonstration of skill

565
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:51,082
during their five-nil victory

566
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:52,842
against Maradona's Argentina

567
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,162
in River Plate's
Estadio Monumental

568
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:56,442
was historic.

569
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:01,562
The road to
the tournament was impressive

570
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:05,122
but Colombia's World Cup dream
rapidly turned into a nightmare.

571
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,242
The team did not live up to

572
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:09,242
their expectations
in the group stage.

573
00:27:09,682 --> 00:27:11,922
They lost their
first match against Romania

574
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:14,082
and the second
to the United States

575
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:18,082
due to an own goal carried out
by defender Andres Escobar.

576
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:22,762
Despite having achieved
victory during the third match

577
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,842
fate was set,
and Colombia was sent home.

[reflective music]

579
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:32,882
The defeat was heart-breaking

580
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,282
and coincided
with some of the hardest times

581
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:36,602
in Colombian history

582
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,522
as the guerrillas
and drug traffickers

583
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:40,442
terrorized
the country's citizens.

584
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,242
Only 11 days after

585
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:43,842
the arrival of the national team

586
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:46,042
Andres Escobar was assassinated.

[explosion]
[fast-paced music]

588
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:52,122
The news tarnished and stained
the national team's success.

589
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:56,242
Valderrama retired from
international football in 1998

590
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:58,442
after playing in
the World Cup in France

591
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:00,162
and in 2002

592
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:02,042
he officially
retired from football

593
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:04,362
leaving behind
the memories he created

594
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:06,402
during his 21-year career.

595
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,602
Although
Valderrama's achievements

596
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:11,882
fill important chapters in

597
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:13,562
the history of
Colombian football

598
00:28:13,762 --> 00:28:16,282
James continues
writing his own story.

599
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:20,162
[music continues]

600
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:26,122
His first year in Europe
was a total success.

601
00:28:26,562 --> 00:28:29,282
In 2010,
Porto won the Europa League

602
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:31,082
and the Taca de Portugal.

603
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:34,562
In 2012, he was recognized

604
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:35,922
as the best player in the league

605
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:37,602
with the Bola de Ouro.

606
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:41,762
In 2013,
he was acquired by Monaco

607
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:44,442
in a deal worth 45 million euros

608
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:46,042
and his development as a player

609
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:48,642
came at a crucial time
for Colombian football.

610
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:52,122
With his leadership
and technical input

611
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:54,562
the Cafeteros
returned to the World Cup

612
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:56,682
following a 16-year absence.

613
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,162
In Brazil 2014,

614
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:02,282
Colombia fascinated millions
with their vibrant style

615
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,562
and James with
his spectacular goals.

616
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:08,242
He was honored
with a Golden Boot

617
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:10,322
three Man of the Match
recognitions

618
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:12,602
and his name began
to appear on the radar

619
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:14,202
of Europe's biggest clubs.

620
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:16,482
It was quite a year for James.

621
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,682
By the third quarter of 2014

622
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:20,642
Spanish giants Real Madrid

623
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:23,642
had signed Rodriquez
for 90 million euros.

624
00:29:29,322 --> 00:29:30,682
During his time in Madrid

625
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:32,402
he won the European Super Cup

626
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:33,722
and the Club World Cup

627
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:36,402
scoring more than
15 phenomenal goals.

628
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:39,562
In 2017

629
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:41,802
Rodriquez departed
the Spanish capital

630
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:44,002
and joined his
current team, Bayern Munich.

[fast-paced music]

632

Comparing these two
Colombian football stars

633
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:52,362
has become inevitable.

634
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,162
James and El Pibe Valderrama

635
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:57,522
have defended
the Colombian colors with honor

636
00:29:57,682 --> 00:29:59,962
and have carried
the number ten with pride.

637
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:03,442
Rodriquez' speed
and vision are things

638
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:05,082
Valderrama did not possess

639
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,562
but Valderrama
compensated his weaknesses

640
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:09,522
with his intelligent
anticipation

641
00:30:09,602 --> 00:30:10,962
and defensive tactics.

642
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,282
James is a bit more versatile

643
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:15,442
and can be placed
in different positions.

644
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:18,562
He has lined up as a winger,
or attacking mid-fielder.

645
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:20,642
Carlos played further back

646
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:23,242
a play-maker during
the majority of his career

647
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,322
and only toward
the end of his career

648
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:26,722
as an attacking mid-fielder.

649
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:31,242
Although Rodriquez
is primarily left-footed

650
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:33,682
these two sensational
assist machines

651
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:36,882
share the incredible ability
to play well with both feet.

652
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,122
They also share the
mental capacity to prioritize

653
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:42,202
making crucial passes
to team-mates,

654
00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:45,162
despite having to sacrifice
scoring opportunities.

655
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:48,082
Valderrama
scored almost 90 goals

656
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,042
throughout his 21-year career

657
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:52,882
while James with
a long way to go in his career

658
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:55,602
has already surpassed
the 100th goal mark.

659
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:02,922
Carlos Valderrama

660
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,642
is known for his eccentric
behavior and charisma.

661
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:08,962
He is idolized as a symbol
of football in his nation.

662
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:11,082
In 2014 he was inducted

663
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,482
into the Football
Hall of Fame in Mexico.

664
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:16,322
He has been married twice,
and has six children.

666
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:21,442
James Rodriquez is one of
the most popular footballers

667
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:22,762
in the world today.

668
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:25,002
He was married to Daniela Ospina

669
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:27,482
sister of his
teammate David Ospina

670
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:30,882
with whom he has a daughter
named Salome Rodriquez.

671
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:33,522
According to Forbes Magazine

672
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:37,042
Rodriquez was one of the
top-earning athletes of 2017.

[explosion]

674
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,213
It's impossible
not to mention Argentina

675
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:44,573
when discussing football.

676
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:47,333
This two-time
World Cup-winning nation

677
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:48,533
has without a doubt

678
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,413
made its name
in the world of football.

679
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:56,133
Two of its most beloved
and legendary players

680
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:58,253
are Diego Armando Maradona

681
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,093
and Lionel Andres Messi.

682
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:01,693
Maradona is considered

683
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:04,573
the best player of
the late 20th century by many

684
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,933
and Messi is one of
the most important figures

685
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,333
in the modern-day game.

686
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:14,173
Maradona was born
on October 30th, 1960

687
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,613
in Via Fiorito

688
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,613
a suburb in Buenos Aires.

689
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,813
Twenty-six years later,
in the city of Rosario

690
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:22,333
Lionel Messi was born.

691
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,173
Like most Argentine children

692
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:27,333
Maradona's
first love was football.

693
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:30,853
Those who saw
Diego play as a child

694
00:32:30,893 --> 00:32:32,573
knew he was built differently.

695
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:38,333
The same
could be said about Lionel.

696
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:41,133
Since childhood, he was
a force to be reckoned with.

697
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:45,573
At the age of eight, Diego
was discovered by a neighbor

698
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:48,413
who took him to train
with Argentinos Juniors.

699
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:52,853
Messi was four years old
when he played for Grandoli

700
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,973
a small local club in his city

701
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:57,773
where he would average
six to seven goals per game.

702
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:04,253
It was obvious that they were
both destined for greatness.

703
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:08,693
In 1976, a week
before his 16th birthday

704
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,133
Diego Maradona
debuted with Argentinos Juniors

705
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:14,133
and during his
five years with the club

706
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,853
he managed to score
a total of 115 goals.

707
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:21,213
His skills on
the pitch amazed everyone

708
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:23,733
and his potential
did not go unnoticed.

709
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:27,373
One of the country's
greatest teams, Boca Juniors

710
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:30,053
did not hesitate
to offer Diego a contract.

711
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:34,093
Maradona reached
the Bombonera in 1981

712
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:35,853
and he played
with one of the most

713
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,373
popular teams in the capital

714
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:39,133
before his 21st birthday

715
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:42,293
but his stay with
the Argentine giants was brief.

716
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:45,533
When the 1982 World Cup arrived

717
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:47,333
Diego formed part of the team

718
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:48,933
that would be
traveling to Spain.

719
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:52,493
Maradona's debut was not enough

720
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:55,573
to take the Albiceleste
past the first round.

721
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:57,733
After the tournament he did not

722
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:59,493
return home with
the national team.

723
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,253
The youngster had been purchased

724
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,053
by football club Barcelona

725
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,413
for seven
point seven million dollars

726
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:07,413
a record-breaking
amount at the time.

727
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,093
[explosion]

728
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,613
Messi's rise in Europe

729
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:13,533
happened under completely
different circumstances.

730
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,293
At the age of 11,
he was diagnosed

731
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,053
with a growth
hormone deficiency.

732
00:34:18,813 --> 00:34:21,053
This almost changed
the course of his life

733
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,733
but his family was persistent

734
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,773
in finding Leo a sponsor that
would pay for his treatments.

735
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:29,853
Representatives
of football club Barcelona

736
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:32,973
had the opportunity
to witness la pulga practice

737
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:34,693
and as soon as they saw him play

738
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:37,813
they decided to cover the entire
cost of his treatment.

739
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:41,253
In 2004, after four years
with the Youth Academy

740
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:43,253
he made his first-team debut.

741
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:47,813
Maradona played in Barcelona
for only two seasons.

742
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:52,213
In 1984, he was
transferred to Napoli.

743
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:55,853
He arrived at the San Paolo
during the prime of his career

744
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,213
ready to make history.

[cheering]

746
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:04,333
In 1986, at the age of 25

747
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:06,373
Maradona was
ready to participate

748
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:07,853
in his second World Cup.

749
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:11,253
[fast-paced music]

750
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:14,733
During this tournament

751
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,853
in the quarter-final
match versus England

752
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:18,893
Diego was involved
in one of the most

753
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,973
controversial
moments of his career

754
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:23,293
and also one of
the most memorable plays

755
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,533
in football history.

756
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,933
A ball that was
disputed between him

757
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:29,893
and English
goal-keeper Peter Shilton

758
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:31,253
ended up in the net.

759
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:32,973
The goal was validated

760
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,013
and the polemical
controversy began.

761
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:37,933
Diego had scored
the goal with his hand.

762
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:40,773
The play was baptized
as 'The Hand of God'

763
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:42,693
and it is still
remembered and discussed

764
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:45,093
in football pitches
across the globe today.

765
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:48,613
Within minutes, Maradona
went from villain to hero.

766
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:52,213
He scored one of the most
incredible goals of his career

767
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,413
so grandiose and spectacular

768
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:56,573
that it was named
'The Goal of the Century.'

769
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:59,933
Eventually, Diego
reached football supremacy

770
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:02,533
by crowning Argentina
World Cup champions

771
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:04,053
for the second time in history.

772
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:07,973
[fast-paced music]

773
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:10,853
Back in Italy, he continued
to astound the fans.

774
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,733
In 1989, he led Napoli
to their first league title

775
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:19,293
and UEFA Cup victory.

776
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,133
Then, in 1990

777
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,533
they achieved
their second Serie A title.

778
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,373
His image has been
immortalized in Italy.

779
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:29,053
His contributions
and leadership in Napoli

780
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:31,213
have left
a permanent mark on its people.

781
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,693
Murals and shrines
throughout the city

782
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,933
are dedicated to him,
and to this day

783
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:39,173
Diego is remembered
as a god in the city of Naples.

784
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:41,773
Despite having
achieved glory in Italy

785
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,813
Maradona began to struggle.
[unsettling music]

786
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:46,333
He tested positive for cocaine

787
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,573
and was consequently
suspended from the sport

788
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:49,853
for 15 months.

789
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:51,733
In 1992

790
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:53,133
he left the Italian club

791
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,293
and his number ten
shirt was retired.

792
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:58,053
But the giant's real downfall

793
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,933
did not come until
the 1994 World Cup

794
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,853
Following the second match

795
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:06,093
he tested positive during
an anti-doping inspection.

796
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:07,973
He was expelled
from the tournament

797
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,533
and Argentina
was eventually eliminated.

798
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:13,213
Diego Armando Maradona

799
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,493
officially retired in 1997

800
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:18,373
sporting his beloved
Boca Juniors jersey.

[fast-paced music]

802
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,173
Lionel Messi made
his World Cup debut

803
00:37:24,213 --> 00:37:26,733
at the 2006
World Cup in Germany.

804
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,613
He was part of the action
during their second game

805
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:31,493
versus Serbia and Montenegro

806
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:34,253
where he scored
his very first World Cup goal.

807
00:37:34,773 --> 00:37:36,093
By 2009

808
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:39,453
La pulga was the star of a team
that was built to succeed.

809
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:42,293
That year,
Barcelona broke the record

810
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,693
for most trophies won
in a competitive year.

811
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:48,773
Messi impressed
during every single match

812
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:51,253
and his incredible
season won him his first

813
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,613
of four consecutive Ballon d'Or.

814
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:55,533
But his peak had yet to come.

815
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,573
In 2012, he broke
another world record

816
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,773
this time for
the highest number of goals

817
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:02,133
scored in a calendar year.

818
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:05,333
Ninety-one goals between
his club and national team

819
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:06,813
earned him that achievement.

820
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:10,013
With three Champions League,
four Ballon d'Or

821
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:13,293
and five Spanish Leagues
conquered by the age of 25

822
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:15,973
the world began to
understand that Lionel Messi

823
00:38:16,053 --> 00:38:17,533
was from another dimension.

824
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:20,613
In the 2014-15 season

825
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,653
he won his third Copa del Rey

826
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,333
fourth Champions League

827
00:38:25,413 --> 00:38:26,853
and seventh Spanish League

828
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:30,013
as well as individually,
his fifth Ballon D'Or.

829
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:35,733
[electronic music]

830
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:37,773
On the pitch, both Diego and Leo

831
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:39,893
fluctuate between
the right wing and the middle

832
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:42,053
playing as
center-attacking mids.

833
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,413
Throughout his career,
Maradona played with more grit

834
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:46,613
always demonstrating

835
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,893
an almost warrior-like
style on the pitch.

836
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:51,773
He efficiently combined
his skill with strength.

837
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:56,973
Messi, on the other hand resorts
more towards his ingenuity

838
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:59,333
vision, and
creativity on the field.

839
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:02,813
Leo has scored more
than 600 goals to date.

840
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:07,093
While El Diego
scored just over 300 goals

841
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:09,013
during his 21-year career.

842
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:11,053
Both are avid dribblers

843
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:13,893
due to the combination of
their small size and agility.

844
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:15,893
Their similar playing styles

845
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:18,373
categorizes them as
the legends they are today.

846
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:22,133
They are recognized as
true technical geniuses

847
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:25,533
distinguished by their mastery
and creativity on the field

848
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:27,573
which they use
to build memorable

849
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,893
indescribable
and effective plays.

The way these two athletes
place themselves on the pitch

851
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:39,573
have many striking similarities

852
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:42,053
but the way these two
have led their private lives

853
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:43,493
could not be more different.

854
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:47,293
Diego Maradona has been
involved in numerous scandals

855
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,613
while Lionel Messi
has led a quieter

856
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:50,973
and more private lifestyle.

857
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:56,173
Maradona married
Claudia Villafane in 1989.

858
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:58,253
The couple had two daughters

859
00:39:58,373 --> 00:39:59,973
Dalma and Giannina.

860
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:01,973
After 14 years together

861
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:03,853
the couple
announced their separation.

862
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:06,013
During his time in Naples

863
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:07,733
he had an extramarital son

864
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:09,213
named Diego Sinagra

865
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:11,853
who is now also
a professional football player.

866
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:16,813
Diego has struggled with
alcohol and drug addiction

867
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:18,053
for many years.

868
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,573
In 2001

869
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:21,693
he was
hospitalized in Buenos Aires

870
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:23,613
due to
a life-threatening overdose.

871
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:25,133
In 2004

872
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:28,013
he stated that he had fully
recovered from his addictions.

873
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:30,493
Maradona has also been very bold

874
00:40:30,573 --> 00:40:32,173
with his political decisions.

875
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,573
His support for
leftist ideologies

876
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,373
have even found
a place on his body.

877
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,613
Diego currently lives in Dubai

878
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:40,013
and enjoys the benefits

879
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:42,213
that his multi-million
dollar career left him.

[fast-paced music]

881
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:45,773
Lionel Messi is the opposite.

882
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:48,853
He stays as far away
from controversy as possible.

883
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:52,333
In 2017, he married
his childhood girlfriend

Antonella Roccuzzo

885
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:55,853
in her hometown Rosario.

886
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,133
Together,
they have three children

887
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:00,853
Thiago, Mateo, and Ciro.

888
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:02,733
Today, Messi is one of

889
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:04,613
the best-paid
athletes in the world.

890
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:06,573
The riches have not changed him.

891
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,493
The Argentine
has remained humble

892
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:10,693
and is known for
his introverted demeanor.
