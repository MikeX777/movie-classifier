00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,497
Based on the novel by Ango Sakaguchi

8
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,503
Written and Directed by Makoto Tezuka

9
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,958
In that house, there lived humans, pigs, dogs, chickens, and ducks, but...

10
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:08,624
the food they ate and the buildings they lived in were almost exactly the same.

11
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,593
The house was horribly twisted and was more like a storeroom than a house.

12
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:17,508
Downstairs lived an older couple. A young girl was lodging in the house's annex.

13
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:21,512
This young girl was pregnant with a child whose father was unknown.

14
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,480
It seems that the second-floor room that I'm renting

15
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,518
used to belong to the couple's son who had lung disease, but...

16
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,521
the room isn't even luxurious to a lung diseased pig.

17
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,400
Even so, the room had a closet, a bathroom, and a cupboard.

18
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,025
Mr. Izawa.

19
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,614
Mr. Izawa. Breakfast is ready.

20
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,621
Oh, what beautiful weather!

21
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,815
Dry your futon out once and a while.

22
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,213
You see this? I had someone fix it.

23
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,218
Oh! It's perfect! Thank goodness.

24
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:44,511
Please wear it.

25
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,222
Your breakfast is gonna get cold, so come down soon, ok?

26
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,645
The couple were tailors, the man teaching about needlework

27
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,815
and, even being a member of the neighborhood committee.

28
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,528
The young girl had been a desk worker at the old neighborhood committee, but...

29
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,992
while sleeping at the office, it seems she become involved with many
of the committee members.

30
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:09,912
Eventually she got pregnant from someone's seed.

31
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,000
Hey! Aki!

32
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,971
She's such a bothersome young girl.

33
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,009
If she's not careful with her baby, she could seriously damage it.

34
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:25,010
She doesn't realize anything!

35
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,980
She's involved with all the committee members.

36
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:34,520
But I'm different. I have no interest in getting involved with stray cats like her.

37
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:38,437
She's almost like a magazine being passed around.

38
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:42,319
She goes from house to house to everyone there is.

39
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,616
I'm really the only one who hasn't given in to her invitations.

40
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,015
Even if she invited you, you wouldn't do anything.

41
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,413
You see? My husband - he doesn't have any courage.

42
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,794
If I don't have any courage, how the hell do I live with you?

43
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,265
The women that live around here are either...

44
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,949
like this exhausted old woman here... or are prostitutes or...

45
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:12,564
are some young girl who has no idea who her kid's father is.

46
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:18,605
Well... because, at the fishmonger's, there are idiots who are using perch...

47
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,608
Hey. No more of that while we're eating.

48
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,578
But... I'm jealous.

49
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:31,583
A job in television... Being surrounded by nymph-like babes...

50
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,622
You're probably getting your hands on just about anything you can, eh?

51
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,836
What are you talking about? Mr. Izawa isn't like you.

52
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,595
I'm sorry, Mr. Izawa.

53
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,634
But a job in television must be an incredibly difficult job.

54
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,637
It's really impressive for someone so young.

55
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,641
Excuse me.

56
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,487
I thought we were going to lose this war.

57
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:13,702
I had at least hid some small preparations for the resistance in a corner of my mind.

58
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,505
This area is mostly cheap apartments,

59
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,009
where concubines and prostitutes live.

60
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:17,015
Because none of the woman have any children, they share the common trait

61
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,516
of cleaning their rooms, which keeps the custodian happy

62
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:25,983
and the women's immorality has never once become a problem.

63
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:34,491
A Chinese murderer was the boss of the gambling hall

64
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:38,996
and his daughter was one of the tailor's pupils.

65
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,966
Next door was an acupressure therapist,

66
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,004
who needed acupressure more than anyone else.

67
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,976
Next door, there was a pickpocket master

68
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:59,016
But, regardless of his appearance, he wasn't very good.

69
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,485
At the exit of the alley, there was a tobacco shop.

70
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,988
A 55-year old woman lived there, powdering her face.

71
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,250
After she had driven away 7 or 8 of her lovers,

72
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:25,292
she couldn't decide whether to get a middle-aged priest or a
middle-aged whatever.

73
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:43,310
But, on the other side of the building, there lived a widow who lived off
a small amount of money.

74
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:49,691
There also was a brother and sister, but their relationship was that of a married couple.

75
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:56,698
But it was thought that this was more economical and their relationship was tolerated

76
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,992
until the brother got a girlfriend.

77
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,971
It became necessary for the widow to get rid of the sister

78
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:17,302
and it was decided that she would be married to a 50 or 60 year old relative.

79
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:19,513
She drank rat poison.

80
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:25,484
After drinking it, she went to the tailor's training, suffered, and died, but...

81
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,526
at that time, the village doctor gave the widow a medical certificate and
the conversation ended right there.

82
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:42,459
Since I was a newspaper journalist, I knew about the lives of these people,

83
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:47,499
but I had never imagined that the squalid outskirts of the shopping district was like this.

84
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,503
I asked if this was caused by human nature being ruined by the war.

85
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:56,508
"No, it's always been like this around here. "

86
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,513
the tailor had replied quietly with a face like a philosopher's.

87
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,519
But the most distinctive person was our neighbor.

88
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:09,605
Our neighbor was insane.

89
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,784
He had a huge fortune, but went out of his way to build his house

90
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:20,824
in the poverty of this alley. It was thought that this was the result of his hatred
for worldly desires.

91
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:28,832
The madman's name was Kogarashi. He had a mother and a 32-33 year old wife.

92
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:34,004
The man's wife was an idiot.

93
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:42,978
One year, Kogarashi left on a trip to Shikoku as a pilgrim.

94
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:48,018
But, at that time, somewhere in Shikoku, he hit it off well with an idiot woman

95
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:51,730
and returned with her as his wife as a pilgrimage souvenir.

96
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:39,528
Sometimes the neighbor would slip in through the fence and play tricks on the livestock

97
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:45,617
but, since I thought he was an important person, I would just quietly nod.

98
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,589
However, what is the difference between the madman and normal people?

99
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:59,513
If there is a difference, the madman is essentially more honest than normal people.

100
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:05,512
The madman laughs when he wants to laugh. He gives a speech when he wants to give a speech.

101
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:09,481
But others fear the fact that he does such things in public.

102
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:14,521
Compared to others, he didn't say a lot of unnecessary rambling things.

103
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:17,524
He was very thoughtful.

104
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,076
Miss Sayo. Miss Sayo.

105
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:30,037
What have I told you!

106
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,047
Have a good day.

107
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:41,048
Thank you.

108
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:13,684
Because of this long war, people's minds had become paralyzed.

109
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:18,300
What was the purpose of this war? Whose sake was this war for?

110
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:27,553
Embracing these questions, the color of life was everyday tension,
smeared out in an endless boredom.

111
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:02,546
All pleasure is provided by the state under the label of "culture. "

112
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:06,758
It is a horrible crime that has rendered the populace helpless.

113
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,724
Media Station. A palace of falsehood and foolishness.

114
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,227
Every kind of ugliness in this world is spit out from here.

115
00:16:17,262 --> 00:16:19,855
The people devoured it.

116
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,825
You bastards are the staff of the "Imperial Special. "

117
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,030
This program is completely different than every other shitty program.

118
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:29,997
This is the nation's "Imperial Special"!

119
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,452
This program is an entirely different world, too good for you assholes.

120
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:35,037
You fuckers aren't humans! You're shit!

121
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:36,837
You're all my shit!

122
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:41,043
Shit doesn't eat or talk. You will listen to what I say and reply.

123
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:42,509
You little shit over there.

124
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,672
Why is the "Imperial Special" so big? Do you know why?

125
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,636
B... Because the ceiling is really high.

126
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,605
You little shit, give me the answer.

127
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,643
B... B.. Because the television ratings are high.

128
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:58,609
I can't hear you.

129
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,645
Because the television ratings are high!

130
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,029
Television ratings of 70%!

131
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:06,568
Which means that almost every idiot in this country watches this show.

132
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:10,072
Why do we have television ratings of 70%?

133
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:11,573
Because Ginga performs on the show.

134
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:16,543
Miss Ginga, you asshole! Miss Ginga!

135
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,081
She's not the type of person you can refer to so casually.

136
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:22,049
Because of Miss Ginga, we are able to eat every day.

137
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:28,048
She may be a disrespectful brat, but she's the top singing idol.

138
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,051
All the women in the country admire her and all the men jack off to her.

139
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:34,520
Everyone here, even the bureau director, adores her

140
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:39,059
And if you make her even a little mad, you're kicking us all in the balls.

141
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,819
That brat is queen here!

142
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:46,859
And tonight's "Imperial Special" is a very special show.

143
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:51,864
It's celebrating the "queen's upcoming 20th birthday.

144
00:17:55,367 --> 00:18:02,082
So, tonight just try to make our queen a little angry and I'll hollow out your eyes and
shove your balls in there!

145
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:04,877
I'll give you a body that can never work again. You got that?!

146
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:06,879
Huh? Do you!?

147
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:07,845
Yes...

148
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,881
I can't hear you!

149
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,847
Yes!

150
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:10,883
Questions?

151
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,889
What is tonight's show's theme?

152
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,897
"What is tonight's show's theme?"

153
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:30,068
What the fuck does that have to do with you? Shit should just shut up and do what it's told.

154
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,074
What? You have a problem?

155
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,961
If there's anyone in my fucking unit without balls, that's a problem.

156
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:46,084
I don't do sex discrimination. I regard you the same as all the fuckers with balls, so be thankful.

157
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,090
What the hell's with that face?

158
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,093
What toilet were you born in, you little shit?

159
00:18:56,595 --> 00:19:00,063
Hey. Can't you hear me?

160
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,149
Is there anything in your brain?

161
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,479
Who's the asshole who let this guy into my sacred workplace?!

162
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,693
If you make me any more irritated, I'm gonna make it so you can never open your mouth again.

163
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:13,695
I'll make it so snot can't even get out your nose.

164
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,713
Hey.

165
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:15,697
Chief!

166
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,702
G... G... Ginga has just entered the building.

167
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,496
Ginga...?

168
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:23,497
Yes.

169
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,000
But... it can't possibly be that time yet.

170
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,003
That fucking brat. What is she thinking?

171
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:37,010
Okay, you bastards. You understand, right? Right...?

172
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,378
Good morning, Miss Ginga.

173
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:08,709
Wow, today you are wearing an especially beautiful outfit.

174
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:10,002
Shut up, faggot.

175
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,423
But haven't you come a little early? The rehearsal is at...

176
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,056
Four o'clock.

177
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,802
at four o'clock. And the actual performance is at...

178
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:19,716
Seven o'clock.

179
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,561
at seven o'clock.

180
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,598
We'd like to have that changed.

181
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:23,397
Huh?

182
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:27,603
We don't need the rehearsal. So please move the schedule up to the actual performance.

183
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:30,487
But... move up the schedule...? It's a live broadcast.

184
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:34,526
That's why I'd like to you record Ginga's portion before the broadcast.

185
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:38,495
Pre-record a live broadcast...? W... What do me mean by this?

186
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:44,001
Today the movements of the stars are bad. This week Aries have bad luck.

187
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:48,686
Yesterday I only slept eight hours. If I don't sleep ten hours, my skin gets dry.

188
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:53,302
Today I'd like to get the performance over with quickly. So finish it before 7, ok?

189
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:59,218
But, Miss Ginga. Today is our final broadcast. A wonderful birthday special. So, let's take
some time out for the rehearsal...

190
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:04,386
I made reservations tonight at The Sky Buffet. The Penne Arabiata there is so delicious.

191
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:09,520
And for dessert Zabaione. The chocolate soufflé is also really good. What should I do?

192
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:10,486
But... But... But...

193
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,607
"But... But... But... " What are you talking like a record for?

194
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:16,026
Can't you hurry up and start? I'm getting annoyed.

195
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:21,281
That dancer over there... Number 2...

196
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:24,034
She's too pretty. Have her removed.

197
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,043
What the hell are you standing around for? Do the preparations for changed schedule of
the main performance!

198
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:34,044
Yes, sir.

199
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,547
Main performance warning announcement.

200
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:27,514
Mr. Ochiai. It seems that you've just randomly decided to change the schedule again.

201
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:28,480
Sir, it's because...

202
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:34,021
If this doesn't go well, we're in trouble. Lately the program's vigor has been down, hasn't it?

203
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:37,441
The bureau director is also worried. So if you're not more careful...

204
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:42,529
I understand. "A place with order" is my motto.

205
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,544
30 seconds until main performance. Everyone, please turn off your cell phones.

206
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,924
10 seconds until main performance.

207
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,843
Camera... OK. Crane... OK.

208
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,848
5 seconds... 4... 3... 2...

209
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,850
Fuck...

210
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:21,026
"Imperial Special"

211
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,996
Hello! People of our nation, we meet again.

212
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:30,626
It's Media Station's best show, "Imperial Special"!

213
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:35,624
Today we just received wonderful news from the front lines, didn't we?

214
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:42,631
That's right! Unit number 17 has broken through enemy lines!
With this capture, we've built a new position!

215
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:00,030
With this victory, we've moved another step forward.

216
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:06,029
Yes. We also have one more important piece of news.
Everyone, you probably already know what I'm talking about.

217
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:11,034
That's right! The 14th of this month is Ginga's 20th birthday.

218
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:17,005
So, I would like to introduce our goddess of victory.

219
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,670
Among our entire nation's marketing, she was chosen as our country's most loved woman.

220
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:26,758
Our nation's biggest star, the charming soldier of love...

221
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,761
Ginga!!

222
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:38,110
When I'm alone, there are times that I cry.

223
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:44,151
There are also nights where I'm shaken by anxiety.

224
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:49,156
But I believe that love's power will protect me.

225
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:51,575
Love's power will crush my enemies.

226
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:04,511
Don't underestimate my power.

227
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:10,760
Even if you're just playing, I'm serious.

228
00:25:10,795 --> 00:25:16,975
I can't escape. It's already too late.

229
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,940
I understand that it's impossible.

230
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:30,412
But I believe.

231
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:37,079
The power of love will protect me.

232
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:51,051
Don't underestimate me. I'm not a child anymore.

233
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:58,023
I don't care that you had a girlfriend.

234
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:05,065
Kindness is something we'll talk about after you win.

235
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,653
I understand that it's unreasonable.

236
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:15,221
But I believe.

237
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:19,079
That's why...

238
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,167
That's why...

239
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:27,629
I'm going to win (I'm going to win)

240
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:30,858
No matter how painful (however painful)

241
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:34,017
I'm going to win (I'm going to win)

242
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:37,521
No matter how difficult (however difficult)

243
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:48,066
In order to crush my enemies, I will roar to heaven.

244
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:51,069
Ah, the power of love!

245
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,063
I'm going to win (I'm going to win)

246
00:27:26,098 --> 00:27:29,066
No matter how painful (however painful)

247
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:33,035
I'm going to win (I'm going to win)

248
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,073
No matter how difficult (however difficult)

249
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:39,333
I'm going to win (I'm going to win)

250
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:43,372
No matter how much I get hurt (however much I get hurt)

251
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:46,392
I'm going to win (I'm going to win)

252
00:27:46,427 --> 00:27:49,378
No matter how sad (however sad)

253
00:27:56,385 --> 00:28:01,390
The directors of mass media television are the worst of the worst.

254
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:09,585
Their everyday conversation, when compared to a businessman or a
government employee or a school teacher,

255
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:17,996
was overflowing with words of human individualism and originality,
but they were nothing more than words.

256
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:26,373
The troubles of life were ridiculous things such as the pain of a hangover and
making passes at women.

257
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:33,088
No matter what time period, these guys are without substance and
nothing but an empty identity.

258
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:36,056
Depending on what's popular, they move from right to left,

259
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:42,097
learning example expressions from a comic book and believing them to be
the expressions of the times.

260
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:47,442
The reality of the times is just that, a superficial idiocy.

261
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:54,610
Depending solely on this multitude of idiots blind actions, the fate of the nation is moving.

262
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:59,198
Hey. In these rough times, what is individuality?

263
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,373
What use is art?

264
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:05,252
Shouldn't television tie together people's dreams BECAUSE these are hard times?

265
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:11,293
In creating a television program, you have to give the populace their dreams
while informing them of the truth.

266
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:13,295
Do you understand?

267
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:24,306
A meeting will be held at 2 o'clock in the special conference room.

268
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,317
They don't understand at all...

269
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:39,279
What television needs now are programs that show humans as they really are.

270
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:42,956
Not dressing them up in some weird outfit and parading them around.

271
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,620
Even though their houses and families are being burned in the air raids...

272
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,585
Izawa...

273
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,797
That 8 millimeter film you made a long time ago...

274
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,298
It was really good.

275
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,511
The film with the wind.

276
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,479
It was just wind blowing.

277
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:10,519
There was no dialogue, but it had a transparency and it felt great.

278
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,521
Izawa...

279
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,815
You've got talent.

280
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,526
I'm jealous...

281
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:04,007
Miss Sayo, Miss Sayo

282
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:06,510
Where did you go?

283
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,477
Miss Sayo

284
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,514
Where did you go?

285
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,871
Miss Sayo, Miss Sayo

286
00:32:13,906 --> 00:32:16,019
Where did you go?

287
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:19,523
I really don't know what to do with her!

288
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:37,518
Good morning.

289
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:55,097
One idiot...

290
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,204
Two idiots...

291
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,833
Three idiots.

292
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,002
Four idiots.

293
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,005
Five idiots.

294
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,528
Six idiots.

295
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:11,391
Seven idiots.

296
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:13,637
Isn't there a shorter skirt for Ginga?
(Ginga: Eight idiots)

297
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:16,014
If it were any shorter than that, it'd ruin the balance.

298
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:18,690
Balance? Balance?! What's that?

299
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:22,145
If you think about the design and volume, a shorter skirt than that would be...

300
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,234
Design, volume, I don't care about any of that. What's important is "legs"! Her legs!

301
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:30,237
People are only looking at legs anyway. Who the hell cares about balance?

302
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,698
In the arrangements, we were told that that was okay.

303
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,032
Who said it was okay?

304
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,244
It was you, wasn't it?

305
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:38,001
No...

306
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,796
Anyway, go change it into a shorter skirt.

307
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:42,833
If we search for one now, we won't make it in time for the main program.

308
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:44,247
Who said to search for one?

309
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,592
Just cut it! snip-snip!

310
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,010
You've got scissors, don't you!? Scissors!

311
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:51,049
If you wanna cut it, come and cut it yourself. Faggot.

312
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,053
Fucking brat...

313
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,055
Hey, you idiot over there!

314
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,432
Come here.

315
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:01,018
I'm talking to you, idiot!

316
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:09,985
You... Cut her skirt.

317
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:11,820
Hurry up and cut it!

318
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,409
Just hurry up and go!

319
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:21,497
Hurry up and cut it!

320
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:42,518
If you can cut it, then go ahead.

321
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,995
What the hell are you waiting for, idiot? Cut it! Cut it! Cut it! Hurry up!

322
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,794
You don't know how to use a scissors?

323
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,505
Are you really that stupid?

324
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,010
You use a scissors like this.

325
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:31,024
Are you okay?

326
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:34,695
Ah, I'm sorry.

327
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,907
Izawa.

328
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,702
This job really isn't for you.

329
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,705
Why don't you change to a different post?

330
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,119
No, I'm fine.

331
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,499
I'll try my best.

332
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:53,297
Excuse me.

333
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,637
What's wrong? Are you okay?

334
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:01,638
I'm okay.

335
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,810
You're Izawa, aren't you?

336
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:09,278
I know about you.

337
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,940
A long time ago, you won an award for a movie you made.

338
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,818
I also had an interest in movies when I was a student.

339
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:16,820
Ah, how rude of me.

340
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:22,534
I'm Nakamura from Production Group Four.

341
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:27,039
The circumstances may not be good, but I'm glad that we could get acquainted.

342
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,542
Well, then, I hope to see you later.

343
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,829
Hey! You thieves!

344
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:09,428
Wait! Hey!

345
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:20,314
Aki, that bitch... I can't believe her...

346
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,321
Mr. Izawa, do you have today off?

347
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,945
I was searching for a film for myself

348
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,984
because I was sick of television's invented fantasy world.

349
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:26,004
But where in this world is any truth?

350
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:31,009
The more I thought about it, the more it seemed that the truth inside myself was moving far away.

351
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:11,016
Mr. Izawa

352
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:11,982
Yes?

353
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:14,394
I'm sorry, but could you help me?

354
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,397
I'd like you to attach an umbrella over there.

355
00:48:17,432 --> 00:48:18,363
An umbrella?

356
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,401
There have been complaints that at night light is escaping from the house.

357
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,064
You fucking idiot!

358
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,108
How dare you be late?

359
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:05,028
What do you think happened because you were late?

360
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:09,700
Our goddess got into a bad mood!

361
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:15,622
"Today my stars' fortune is low. So I'm going to rest. "

362
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:20,127
You asshole! It's all because of your lateness!

363
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,129
What are you gonna do about my schedule?

364
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,096
Go apologize.

365
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:29,219
Dance or something. Lure that fucking Amaterasu back here.

366
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:30,220
Excuse me.

367
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:55,537
I'll tell you beforehand. Today is impossible. No matter how much you beg, it's useless.

368
00:49:55,572 --> 00:49:59,500
Even if you offered her your other ear.

369
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,472
Don't ask her anything unnecessary.

370
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:10,010
Don't talk about her appearance or proportions.

371
00:50:10,045 --> 00:50:11,977
Especially about her nose.

372
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:16,016
And any conversation about family is definitely taboo.

373
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,018
You got it, right?

374
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,021
Don't make her mad.

375
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:24,525
But, you know what?

376
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:30,996
Don't listen to what she says to you seriously.

377
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:35,619
If she says she's going to give something to you, don't take it. Don't give her anything, either.

378
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,622
If you're not careful,

379
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:41,625
you could lose your life.

380
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,649
Do you think that the body and the mind are separate things?

381
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,992
Men are all stupid, aren't they?

382
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:12,204
You say "body" and all they can think of is sex.

383
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:18,829
And if I spend several hundred years thinking about who I am, where I'm going, where I came from,
I wonder if I still won't know...

384
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:21,832
It just means that thinking is a waste of time.

385
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,845
Don't just stand there. Why don't you sit down?

386
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:40,017
I didn't see you this morning.

387
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:41,518
What was wrong?

388
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:50,027
You were late, weren't you?

389
00:51:50,062 --> 00:51:51,445
Did you get hit?

390
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,415
And you came to apologize?

391
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:00,954
How stupid. Did you think that I was in a bad mood because of you?

392
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:05,542
I hate that stupid vulgar faggot.

393
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:08,545
Eventually I'll do something about him.

394
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:25,562
Sit down.

395
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:40,744
I'm sorry about what I did to your ear. How are you feeling?

396
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,042
The faggot hit you?

397
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:48,752
Show me.

398
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:55,342
What are you scared for? What do you think I am?

399
00:52:55,377 --> 00:52:56,343
Show me.

400
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:05,352
Here? He hit you here?

401
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,323
No! I'm just joking around!

402
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,361
You came all the way here. So enjoy yourself.

403
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:16,572
Work is over for today, anyway.

404
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:20,534
You're an interesting person, aren't you?

405
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:22,709
I like interesting people.

406
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:28,041
That face. Why are you making that kind of face?

407
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:33,463
Why don't you say anything?

408
00:53:33,498 --> 00:53:35,549
Are you nervous?

409
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,343
You're worried, aren't you?

410
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:40,762
It's okay.

411
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,063
A pretty face.

412
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:56,570
You said you were Izawa, right?

413
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:00,574
Izawa what?

414
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,043
You rent a room in the slums, right?

415
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:08,081
You can't call women to a dirty place like that.

416
00:54:08,116 --> 00:54:11,084
I'll introduce you to a cleaner place.

417
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:14,463
I know all about you.

418
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:18,675
You were born in Niigata and ran away from home.

419
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:26,683
You avoided becoming a soldier because you have a weak body.
Instead you became a journalist

420
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:30,187
But you didn't like writing articles about the war, did you?

421
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:38,070
Running away from your home, running away from the war, and you ended up here.

422
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:41,490
How was it? Is it like heaven here?

423
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:50,457
Oh, you're a good boy. I understand real well how smart you are.

424
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,460
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

425
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:54,426
No...

426
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:59,591
You think I'm starving for a man? The one who's starving is you.

427
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:04,471
You really want a woman. That's your biggest desire, isn't it?

428
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:07,439
You just don't want to admit it.

429
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,435
You're scared of living with a woman.

430
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:13,362
Dishes and tableware and miso and rice...

431
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:17,317
A child gets born and you have to listen to grumbling and complaining.

432
00:55:17,352 --> 00:55:21,693
Your pride and desires and success all disappear.

433
00:55:21,728 --> 00:55:25,999
Your own lifestyle is squashed like dog shit,

434
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:31,039
dried up and blown away by the wind, leaving no traces.

435
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:34,042
Even the marks from her nails will disappear.

436
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,044
It's an unbearable life.

437
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:40,340
Do you think that women bring about that kind of life?!

438
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:43,135
What you're afraid of is just the vanity of the world!

439
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:52,019
I'll kill you. Say something. "Stop it" or "Forgive me" or something.

440
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:57,983
You're cocky, aren't you?

441
00:55:58,484 --> 00:55:59,485
It's cute.

442
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:02,870
There's nothing to think about.

443
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:08,619
If you get along with me, you can live a lot easier.

444
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:11,378
No one will bully you anymore.

445
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,790
You can become even more distinguished.

446
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,003
You can even make the movies you love most.

447
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:23,425
Accept me.

448
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:26,428
You want to see the real heaven?

449
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:02,297
Hey, what did you do to Ginga?

450
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:22,025
I don't even have the strength to deal with the horror of this reality.

451
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:26,662
Ah, war. This great destruction.

452
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:30,033
By this incredibly bizarre impartiality, everyone is judged.

453
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:36,331
My fellow countrymen collapsing one after another like dolls made of mud...

454
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,918
It is a meaningless and sad feeling of love.

455
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:04,730
I thought that she had probably been scolded and ran here to escape.

456
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:11,632
But, to wake up the neighbor in the middle of the night and return his wife would be difficult...

457
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:17,534
But, on the other hand, staying with a woman for the night could produce a great misunderstanding.

458
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:22,539
Since her husband was insane, I couldn't even imagine what would happen.

459
01:00:22,574 --> 01:00:28,128
But, I was tired and didn't really care what would happen next.

460
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,103
If you'd like, you can come out here...

461
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:57,533
I'm going to get the futon out.

462
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:02,014
Please sleep here.

463
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:54,770
I'm...

464
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:56,522
hated...

465
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:04,530
I shouldn't have come.

466
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:11,537
I'm hated...

467
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:15,541
I didn't think so...

468
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:32,015
Why won't you touch me?

469
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:16,328
What are words? What value do they have?

470
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:23,043
Even human love has no proof other than words.

471
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:30,133
Where is the truth that can be entrusted with the passion of life?

472
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:33,428
It is all a shadow of falsehood.

473
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:59,830
From that day on, a different life started.

474
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:14,845
But other than the increase of a female body in a house, nothing else changed.

475
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:11,819
Mr. Izawa.

476
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:15,788
Mr. Izawa, can I come in?

477
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:19,827
I brought you some sweets. Isn't it boring eating by yourself?

478
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:23,539
At least dry your futon out every now and then.

479
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,751
It's alright. I'll dry it out myself.

480
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:28,836
Don't forget.

481
01:09:28,871 --> 01:09:29,962
I won't.

482
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:52,943
But when I stepped one foot out of the house, I completely forgot about the idiot woman.

483
01:09:54,027 --> 01:09:58,886
Somehow, those events weren't clear in my memory.

484
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:03,745
It felt like they had occurred 10 or 20 years ago.

485
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:12,629
War was a strange yet healthy amnesia.

486
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:23,286
The awakening of a new life.

487
01:10:23,321 --> 01:10:30,564
Shining miracles of today.

488
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:42,868
A shining sky. Your voice with our dreams.

489
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:14,323
I'm thinking about a new project...

490
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:19,238
This is off the record, but I'm planning on making a movie.

491
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:25,452
Companies are providing new computer terminals for imaging now.

492
01:11:25,487 --> 01:11:27,663
It's what you might call New Wave Media.

493
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:33,836
Izawa, the war is bringing in a new situation.

494
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:36,428
And that is an "information attack. "

495
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:41,051
It'll change from operations information to fighting information which we'll use as a weapon.

496
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:44,054
But the weak point in this plan is...

497
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:47,349
It's only a system with no substance.

498
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:51,318
It's lacking attractive contents.

499
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:54,856
We call it pioneering a new media, but...

500
01:11:54,891 --> 01:11:58,360
it still can't compete with the old films.

501
01:11:58,395 --> 01:11:59,361
Don't you think so?

502
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:05,833
That's why we have to re-envision film.

503
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:14,084
But the upper class are losing their sensitivity and passion for cinema.

504
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:18,411
So I want to entrust this with the younger generation.

505
01:12:19,811 --> 01:12:20,811
What do you think?

506
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:23,811
Don't you have any interest in my proposal?

507
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:30,491
But I'm just a directing assistant.

508
01:12:32,211 --> 01:12:37,491
Well, certainly it may be unusual for me to have this kind of conversation
with someone I don't know well.

509
01:12:38,411 --> 01:12:46,011
But, seeing you, I was reminded of my own youth.

510
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:50,251
"I was like him too once... "

511
01:12:52,611 --> 01:12:58,251
I was defiant back then and was always arguing.

512
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:01,251
I was bullied often.

513
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:06,691
There. The cigarette burns are still left.

514
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:13,176
I got in an argument with one of my seniors and he burnt me with his cigarette.

515
01:13:13,211 --> 01:13:21,531
Well, I was bullied and bullied. And, as I was thinking up excuses, I became a skilled producer.

516
01:13:23,211 --> 01:13:28,331
So, when I met you, it just came to me.

517
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:30,651
How do I say this?

518
01:13:31,651 --> 01:13:33,651
You were so transparent...

519
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:35,811
Izawa.

520
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:37,811
I can feel it.

521
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:42,251
The beautiful energy that flows out of you.

522
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:44,051
A flow of clear energy...

523
01:13:45,731 --> 01:13:47,611
I'm interested in you.

524
01:13:49,611 --> 01:13:52,611
I'd like to take a risk with you.

525
01:13:52,646 --> 01:13:53,611
What do you think?

526
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:55,851
Won't you join me?

527
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:04,536
What do you want me to do?

528
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:07,176
First there's planning. I need a screenplay.

529
01:14:07,211 --> 01:14:13,211
It's alright if it's just temporary, but can you work something out by next Thursday?

530
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:18,151
Please freely write about something daring.

531
01:14:18,186 --> 01:14:21,171
Those kinds of things are always the best.

532
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:30,371
Don't worry. If I must say, I'm the most flexible producer around here.

533
01:14:30,651 --> 01:14:34,171
Well, I am a little eccentric.

534
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:36,171
Izawa.

535
01:14:37,171 --> 01:14:38,771
I'm looking forward to your work.

536
01:14:39,531 --> 01:14:42,691
Youth have to produce the good stuff.

537
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:50,651
Is something wrong?

538
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:56,131
Uh, no. I wonder what it could be. Maybe there are rats in this house or something...

539
01:17:29,171 --> 01:17:34,571
The last couple in the world is walking towards the world's end.

540
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:41,291
The two continued on and on through the cold wind.

541
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:45,211
They finally arrived at the world's end.

542
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:47,771
It was the mountain where God lives.

543
01:17:48,771 --> 01:17:54,851
They climbed the mountain, put pepper on their lips, and prayed for the world to end.

544
01:17:56,971 --> 01:17:59,171
Everything disappeared.

545
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:07,531
Mountains... Men... Women... Colors... Even light...

546
01:18:09,171 --> 01:18:14,771
Then God appeared and blessed the couple.

547
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:22,171
Then God remade the world again.

548
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:27,171
Eternally new...

549
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:31,171
very nostalgic...

550
01:20:18,171 --> 01:20:23,771
Attention. Today's studio inspection has been cancelled.

551
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:31,211
An accident occurred.

552
01:20:32,771 --> 01:20:37,571
Ochiai's head was directly struck by some lighting, almost as if he had been targeted.

553
01:20:49,171 --> 01:20:55,171
Everyone in the establishment was brought together
and my colleague, Yoshida, was suddenly chosen as the new director.

554
01:20:55,206 --> 01:20:58,691
No one had even imagined he'd have been singled out for director.

555
01:20:58,726 --> 01:21:01,971
It all proceeded as if it were part of some movie scenario.

556
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,971
Once again my days of boredom had returned.

557
01:23:00,171 --> 01:23:01,171
Sorry...

558
01:23:25,771 --> 01:23:27,171
Push harder.

559
01:23:28,651 --> 01:23:29,171
Push.

560
01:24:56,171 --> 01:25:02,691
It was during a day off at midday when, from far off, a bombing attack began.

561
01:25:02,726 --> 01:25:08,171
Since we didn't have a bomb shelter, we hid in my closet.

562
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:25,891
I had written a screenplay about a 27-year old directing assistant who was living with an idiot woman.

563
01:28:26,891 --> 01:28:30,891
Had I written the truth? Or did what I write become the truth?

564
01:28:30,926 --> 01:28:33,371
I myself didn't even know.

565
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:44,411
This is a pretty difficult project...

566
01:28:44,691 --> 01:28:46,771
I don't mean that it's bad, but...

567
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:50,491
I wonder if the television viewers will understand it...

568
01:28:53,491 --> 01:28:55,491
Don't misunderstand me.

569
01:28:56,491 --> 01:28:58,456
I don't hate this kind of stuff.

570
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:01,491
I mean, there are a lot of worthless programs on TV.

571
01:29:01,526 --> 01:29:04,491
I think that literary movies are essential.

572
01:29:05,691 --> 01:29:07,491
This is a novel idea.

573
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:10,491
How do I say this?

574
01:29:13,211 --> 01:29:16,491
I just wonder whether the average viewer will understand this.

575
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:20,531
Because viewers are incredibly stupid.

576
01:29:21,531 --> 01:29:24,891
But more than that, I wonder what the intellectual community would say about this...

577
01:29:25,691 --> 01:29:28,891
It might be quite difficult to make money with this.

578
01:29:31,691 --> 01:29:35,891
For the mean time, let's use this as a basis and leave the screenplay to a professional.

579
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,211
It might change quite a bit...

580
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:45,211
To be honest, I don't really know whether this is interesting or not...

581
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:49,656
Izawa

582
01:29:49,691 --> 01:29:51,656
I'm not saying this is impossible.

583
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:55,211
This kind of project is decided by its main star.

584
01:29:55,246 --> 01:29:58,731
This main character... the "idiot woman"...

585
01:29:58,766 --> 01:30:00,891
Is it alright to tell you my opinion?

586
01:30:00,931 --> 01:30:03,911
For the main character...

587
01:30:03,946 --> 01:30:06,856
I'd like to go with her.

588
01:30:06,891 --> 01:30:09,891
Of course, you know her pretty well, too.

589
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:13,211
She's really popular right now, right?

590
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:18,891
Actually, I'm the one who first discovered and brought up Ginga.

591
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:22,891
I'd like to work with her again.

592
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:27,211
She's on your program pretty often, isn't she?

593
01:30:28,211 --> 01:30:30,211
I'm sorry, but...

594
01:30:32,211 --> 01:30:34,851
Could you ask her to make the movie with me?

595
01:30:34,886 --> 01:30:37,491
It'd be faster than talking with her manager.

596
01:30:37,526 --> 01:30:40,211
And it's your screenplay. Can you do it?

597
01:30:40,246 --> 01:30:42,211
This is a big chance for you.

598
01:30:43,731 --> 01:30:46,211
Hey... Izawa!

599
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:56,011
Studio #1- "Imperial Special"- 's run-through will be conducted at 3 o'clock.

600
01:30:57,011 --> 01:30:59,731
Studio #1's run-through will begin at 3 o'clock.

601
01:31:08,211 --> 01:31:09,656
My candy!

602
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:12,211
Someone, bring me my candy!

603
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:15,211
Please.

604
01:31:56,931 --> 01:31:58,931
Unwrap it.

605
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:26,891
I don't like those eyes.

606
01:32:26,926 --> 01:32:28,731
Don't look at me!

607
01:32:32,251 --> 01:32:34,696
Disgusting eyes...

608
01:32:34,731 --> 01:32:36,531
I'd like to hollow them out.

609
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:42,651
Do you think that I'm Satan?

610
01:32:52,651 --> 01:32:53,851
Pick it up.

611
01:33:09,811 --> 01:33:11,131
Why don't you eat it?

612
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:15,096
It's delicious.

613
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,131
With my saliva all over it.

614
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:29,131
Pig.

615
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:08,651
Ginga, Happy Birthday.

616
01:34:08,686 --> 01:34:10,131
Thank you!

617
01:34:11,651 --> 01:34:14,131
Today Ginga is especially beautiful.

618
01:34:14,451 --> 01:34:18,211
Don't stare at her so much. The aftermath is pretty scary.

619
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:36,251
Oh, isn't this a surprise? Meeting you here.

620
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:40,851
Is it strange that I'm here? The first person to discover Ginga was me, anyway.

621
01:34:42,451 --> 01:34:44,851
And that's the one thing you always complain about.

622
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:49,411
You're one to talk. Stealing her from me...

623
01:34:52,051 --> 01:34:54,376
But it's rather impressive.

624
01:34:54,411 --> 01:34:56,451
Getting along with the bureau director, huh?

625
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:59,451
You sure have gotten ahead in life.

626
01:35:00,211 --> 01:35:02,851
How many men have you crushed by now?

627
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:07,851
This isn't a place for losers.

628
01:35:20,971 --> 01:35:23,851
Ginga, you should dance too.

629
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:25,416
Dance, Ginga.

630
01:35:25,451 --> 01:35:27,451
You want me to dance?

631
01:35:27,486 --> 01:35:28,908
I'm expensive.

632
01:35:28,943 --> 01:35:30,331
Come on. Dance!

633
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:32,591
I don't want to dance today.

634
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,456
You shouldn't dance, Ginga.

635
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:38,331
It's my request, Ginga. Dance for me, the bureau director.

636
01:35:38,366 --> 01:35:41,096
No, Ginga. Don't dance.

637
01:35:41,131 --> 01:35:44,096
Do I have to dance for free?

638
01:35:44,131 --> 01:35:46,651
If you dance for me, I'll give you anything.

639
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:49,136
Really? Anything?

640
01:35:49,171 --> 01:35:51,671
Anything. Today is your 20th birthday.

641
01:35:51,706 --> 01:35:54,171
If you want something, just tell me.

642
01:35:55,171 --> 01:35:57,136
Do you really promise?

643
01:35:57,171 --> 01:36:04,171
Hey. Who do you think I am? Whether it be a tank or a platoon, I can give you anything.

644
01:36:04,206 --> 01:36:05,971
Well, then I'll dance.

645
01:36:06,571 --> 01:36:07,691
Ginga...

646
01:38:37,171 --> 01:38:39,851
Wonderful, Ginga. You were wonderful.

647
01:38:39,886 --> 01:38:42,416
So, you'll give me what I want?

648
01:38:42,451 --> 01:38:47,091
Whatever you want. Clothes? Cars? Jewelry?

649
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:50,616
On a silver plate...

650
01:38:50,651 --> 01:38:54,451
On a silver plate... what?

651
01:38:56,171 --> 01:38:58,171
A mountain of candy?

652
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:02,171
Izawa's head.

653
01:39:05,771 --> 01:39:07,571
Izawa's head...

654
01:39:08,691 --> 01:39:10,571
Who's Izawa?

655
01:39:44,171 --> 01:39:45,611
This is great.

656
01:40:07,651 --> 01:40:13,571
Ginga, how do you wanna... cook this guy?

657
01:40:16,171 --> 01:40:17,571
Leave.

658
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:19,571
Everyone, leave.

659
01:40:21,451 --> 01:40:22,576
Leave!

660
01:40:22,611 --> 01:40:23,811
Get out of here!

661
01:40:23,891 --> 01:40:26,171
Everyone, get out of here!

662
01:40:26,206 --> 01:40:27,656
What's wrong, Ginga?

663
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:29,171
Everyone, get out of here!

664
01:40:31,971 --> 01:40:32,891
Stop it!

665
01:40:34,891 --> 01:40:37,891
Hurry up! What are you doing? Get out of here!

666
01:40:37,926 --> 01:40:38,891
Hurry!

667
01:40:39,211 --> 01:40:41,891
Go away! Everyone!

668
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:44,711
Get out of here!

669
01:40:44,746 --> 01:40:46,211
Everyone, leave!

670
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:52,211
Ginga.

671
01:40:53,211 --> 01:40:54,371
You too. Get out of here.

672
01:41:26,411 --> 01:41:29,211
A lot of people died today.

673
01:41:31,571 --> 01:41:37,491
Over here and over there, lots of idiots are dying.

674
01:41:51,611 --> 01:41:53,811
You look pathetic.

675
01:41:56,971 --> 01:41:59,811
I thought I told you to stop looking at me like that!

676
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:05,131
You look horrible.

677
01:42:05,891 --> 01:42:08,131
Just horrible.

678
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:11,611
Why don't you quit working here?

679
01:42:12,211 --> 01:42:15,211
You could quit any time you want.

680
01:42:15,246 --> 01:42:18,211
Why are you always getting in my way?

681
01:42:22,211 --> 01:42:23,851
An honest man.

682
01:42:23,886 --> 01:42:25,456
But just honest.

683
01:42:25,491 --> 01:42:28,011
That's why you can't become a bad person.

684
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:31,211
Good things and bad things... You don't judge anything...

685
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:33,336
Saying nothing and doing nothing...

686
01:42:33,371 --> 01:42:36,731
It's almost like you're being wise like an old man.

687
01:42:37,731 --> 01:42:39,211
You're so great.

688
01:42:40,731 --> 01:42:43,691
Really you think that I'm pitiable, don't you?

689
01:42:45,611 --> 01:42:49,691
You also think that yourself and the war are pitiable.

690
01:42:50,211 --> 01:42:53,691
Just like God, you're watching life from outside the world.

691
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:57,491
How noble of you.

692
01:42:59,491 --> 01:43:03,731
Well, you know what? I don't like or dislike this world, either.

693
01:43:03,766 --> 01:43:07,211
I don't really care if the world is destroyed or anything.

694
01:43:07,246 --> 01:43:09,696
But, I am different from you

695
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:12,976
in that I'm trying my hardest to live.

696
01:43:13,011 --> 01:43:17,211
I like desperately living like a bug, ugly and frantically flailing arms and legs.

697
01:43:18,211 --> 01:43:20,711
I could kill you right now.

698
01:43:20,746 --> 01:43:23,211
Because humans die so easily.

699
01:43:27,251 --> 01:43:31,251
Because... living is so much harder...

700
01:43:42,211 --> 01:43:46,931
I saw eyes like yours a long time ago.

701
01:43:51,651 --> 01:43:53,931
The eyes of someone determined...

702
01:44:01,931 --> 01:44:07,251
When I was a child, my house was burned down and I fled with my mother.

703
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:16,531
Right before my eyes, a man was being beaten by a crowd of men.

704
01:44:19,411 --> 01:44:22,176
Because the man wasn't Japanese...

705
01:44:22,211 --> 01:44:26,211
There wasn't any real reason, but the man was lynched anyway.

706
01:44:27,731 --> 01:44:32,411
The man, noticing us, looked in our direction.

707
01:44:35,411 --> 01:44:38,931
Then the men who were beating him noticed us.

708
01:44:41,931 --> 01:44:45,211
They asked the man...

709
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:49,251
"Is that your family?"

710
01:44:53,251 --> 01:44:57,731
The man, while staring at us, replied...

711
01:45:02,731 --> 01:45:04,731
"No. "

712
01:45:08,771 --> 01:45:11,211
They were chilling eyes.

713
01:45:14,051 --> 01:45:16,651
Determined eyes...

714
01:45:17,651 --> 01:45:20,211
They were the eyes of one awaiting death.

715
01:45:23,731 --> 01:45:26,731
This time the men asked us.

716
01:45:28,731 --> 01:45:31,731
"Is this your father?"

717
01:45:36,811 --> 01:45:39,731
I was scared and couldn't say anything.

718
01:45:42,971 --> 01:45:45,216
So I ran.

719
01:45:45,251 --> 01:45:48,451
I ran for a while and then turned around.

720
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:52,411
I couldn't see the man anymore.

721
01:45:54,411 --> 01:45:57,771
Because the group of men had surrounded the man and wouldn't stop beating him.

722
01:45:58,771 --> 01:46:02,211
My mother pulled me by my hand and we ran and ran.

723
01:46:02,251 --> 01:46:05,211
But no matter where we went, it was Hell.

724
01:46:07,651 --> 01:46:12,651
But... what had burned into my eyes...

725
01:46:14,651 --> 01:46:15,851
those eyes...

726
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:18,851
That look...

727
01:46:21,731 --> 01:46:25,451
The eyes of a determined man...

728
01:46:27,451 --> 01:46:30,451
The look of a man challenging death...

729
01:46:34,771 --> 01:46:37,451
The same as your eyes.

730
01:46:41,251 --> 01:46:43,451
This is ridiculous.

731
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:48,451
Determined people, people who scoff at those things... All humans are worthless.

732
01:46:48,771 --> 01:46:50,096
It's so stupid.

733
01:46:50,131 --> 01:46:55,096
It's hilarious. I laugh at it.

734
01:46:55,131 --> 01:47:00,171
This world and all its people can die at my feet, looking up at me.

735
01:47:00,651 --> 01:47:02,136
I'll live on.

736
01:47:02,171 --> 01:47:05,971
I'll live on, crushing people as I dance.

737
01:47:06,006 --> 01:47:07,171
Is that strange?

738
01:47:07,206 --> 01:47:08,171
Am I crazy?

739
01:47:08,651 --> 01:47:10,551
I'm scared of dying.

740
01:47:10,586 --> 01:47:12,416
I don't want to die.

741
01:47:12,451 --> 01:47:14,691
That's why I'm scared of you.

742
01:47:15,171 --> 01:47:17,451
Your honesty scares me.

743
01:47:19,131 --> 01:47:22,691
When I look at you, I come to my senses.

744
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:30,171
If I come to my senses, I won't be able to live any more.

745
01:47:52,651 --> 01:47:54,651
Don't come here ever again.

746
01:48:29,651 --> 01:48:32,616
I'm 20 now.

747
01:48:32,651 --> 01:48:35,616
We should have a huge party.

748
01:48:35,651 --> 01:48:38,891
I'll wear clothes that will make everyone jealous...

749
01:48:39,891 --> 01:48:44,691
Everyone will celebrate my birthday on a simultaneous national broadcast

750
01:48:59,691 --> 01:49:01,651
Help me...

751
01:49:46,651 --> 01:49:47,651
What's wrong?

752
01:50:36,651 --> 01:50:38,651
Was I dreaming?

753
01:50:39,171 --> 01:50:45,171
No... Is there proof that even this reality isn't a dream?

754
01:51:16,171 --> 01:51:22,136
I wanted to make sure... of my lost time...

755
01:51:22,171 --> 01:51:28,451
...of her shadow... her skin... her existence...

756
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:35,171
More than that, I had to verify my own existence.

757
01:51:39,171 --> 01:51:40,971
Where am I?

758
01:54:28,411 --> 01:54:30,171
Do you like them?

759
01:54:52,571 --> 01:54:55,171
This one is better made.

760
01:54:59,171 --> 01:55:05,171
These stones. They are saying that they want a face.

761
01:55:06,771 --> 01:55:09,171
that they want me to draw them a face.

762
01:55:12,691 --> 01:55:16,211
You know what you are, right?

763
01:55:20,211 --> 01:55:25,211
These stones also know that they are stones.

764
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:34,171
What separates men from stones?

765
01:55:36,571 --> 01:55:37,891
Is it wisdom?

766
01:55:40,891 --> 01:55:42,891
Is it life?

767
01:55:42,926 --> 01:55:43,691
No.

768
01:55:46,891 --> 01:55:48,891
It's a face.

769
01:55:52,611 --> 01:55:55,891
Because it lacks a face, it is just a stone.

770
01:56:01,691 --> 01:56:08,211
Because it has a face, you are you and I am me.

771
01:56:10,211 --> 01:56:14,571
But if you didn't have a face...

772
01:56:15,211 --> 01:56:18,536
and if I didn't have a face...

773
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:21,171
there is nothing to separate you from me.

774
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:27,171
It is the same with a stone.

775
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:35,171
You are I are only stones with faces.

776
01:56:35,891 --> 01:56:45,211
There are tens of thousands of stones with faces jumbled together in this world.

777
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:32,571
She is...

778
01:57:35,211 --> 01:57:36,571
Sayo is...

779
01:57:37,491 --> 01:57:39,571
a stone without a face.

780
01:57:41,571 --> 01:57:44,611
That's because she is a part of her hometown.

781
01:57:44,646 --> 01:57:47,891
Humans need a hometown.

782
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:54,691
Things other than humans also have hometowns.

783
01:57:55,691 --> 01:58:05,211
Dogs... cats... even stones have hometowns...

784
01:58:07,211 --> 01:58:12,611
In the end, everyone returns to their hometown.

785
01:58:19,211 --> 01:58:30,611
One rakes up the helplessness of the world.

786
01:58:30,646 --> 01:58:41,576
Secretly the dream has become clear.

787
01:58:41,611 --> 01:58:53,611
One rakes up the helplessness of the world.

788
01:58:54,611 --> 01:59:07,731
Secretly the dream has become clear.

789
01:59:48,211 --> 01:59:51,211
Mother... Mother...

790
01:59:53,611 --> 01:59:54,411
Mother...

791
01:59:56,611 --> 01:59:57,731
Mother...

792
02:01:24,731 --> 02:01:26,731
Go home.

793
02:01:28,251 --> 02:01:30,251
You shouldn't be here.

794
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:00,211
Aki!

795
02:02:01,931 --> 02:02:04,176
Where did she go with that baby?

796
02:02:04,211 --> 02:02:11,251
Mr. Izawa, I thought that we'd be okay for another 4 or 5 days, but this town is finally over too.

797
02:02:11,286 --> 02:02:13,251
Let's run away together.

798
02:02:22,211 --> 02:02:24,691
Run away? To where?

799
02:02:25,211 --> 02:02:28,176
This time I had made up my mind.

800
02:02:28,211 --> 02:02:32,211
The great love of war would solve everything.

801
02:03:27,211 --> 02:03:30,176
Mr. Izawa, I'm going to get out of here.

802
02:03:30,211 --> 02:03:34,251
I don't want to stay around and die in smoke.

803
02:03:38,731 --> 02:03:41,251
Good luck.

804
02:06:47,211 --> 02:06:51,211
This is my final film.

805
02:08:51,211 --> 02:08:55,731
Miss Sayo, let's run away together.

806
02:11:08,731 --> 02:11:10,731
So pretty...

807
02:14:00,731 --> 02:14:03,216
Don't go over there!

808
02:14:03,251 --> 02:14:05,031
If you go there, you'll only die.

809
02:14:05,066 --> 02:14:06,811
When you die, we'll do it together.

810
02:14:07,611 --> 02:14:08,811
Don't be scared!

811
02:14:09,611 --> 02:14:10,811
And don't leave me.

812
02:14:11,251 --> 02:14:15,851
Forget about the fire and the bombs and we'll go down this street together.

813
02:14:15,886 --> 02:14:18,851
Look straight ahead down this street and hold onto my shoulder.

814
02:14:19,771 --> 02:14:20,851
Alright?

815
02:14:21,611 --> 02:14:22,851
You got it?

816
02:16:57,731 --> 02:17:01,531
Is she alright? Is she injured?

817
02:17:03,251 --> 02:17:06,531
Be brave and hold on.

818
02:17:24,211 --> 02:17:30,731
I took the idiot woman's hand and walked on and on.

819
02:17:31,251 --> 02:17:37,651
We walk endlessly down the eternal path.

820
02:21:41,651 --> 02:21:47,651
"Thinking of tomorrow, Izawa lowered his eyes. "

821
02:22:45,251 --> 02:22:47,251
