1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Stan, no!

2
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,400
Come on, Susy.

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Oh, Stan, you are wicked.

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, you don't half get me going.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,400
Oh, darling.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,200
No, stop it.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,400
We mustn't, not here.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Susy, please.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
We're only here for five minutes.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,400
I know, I know, come on.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,600
Oh, I do love you, Stan. Do you love me?

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,600
Yes, of course I do, of course I do.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Why can't we get on?
You're due out.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,400
Regulations. My driver's
carrying out an inspection.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
How long is he gonna be?

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,400
Don't know, mate, but we
can't leave 'til he's satisfied.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
You do love me, don't
you, you really do love me?

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Yes, of course I do, of course I do.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,600
And you will marry me one day?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Yes, of course, you know
I will, course I will.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, darling, that means we're engaged!

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,800
Yes, we're engaged.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
Wait a minute, what do
you mean we're engaged?

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Now that you've asked me,
you can have another kiss.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
No, I didn't, what I'm
trying to say is, oh.

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
Now don't misunderstand me, oh!

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
I hope Stan hurries up.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,800
The passengers are
getting a bit impatient.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,600
Here comes one behind.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
We've only got 20 minutes
to get back to the depot.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Stan will never make it.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Cor, we've been here long enough.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
He should've made it by now.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Oh God, here comes
Hitler. That's all we need.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,200
Why are you still here?

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,200
Oh no, the driver's not even in his cab,

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,400
there's no point in ringing
the bell for him to go.

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Go? I'm ringing for him to stop.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,000
Eh?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
Butler,

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
what was you doing upstairs?

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh, oh, oh, that's it, is it?

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
How dare you, upstairs.

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,000
You know the regulations.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,600
You're not even supposed
to eat your lunch upstairs.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm surprised at you, miss,

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
holding up the bus service so you can,

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,000
with him of all people.

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,000
It's all right, Inspector,
we just got engaged.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Engaged?

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
To him?

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Oh God.

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
What's wrong with that?

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,600
In all the years I've known him,

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
he's never even managed
to get his bus in on time.

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Come on, get these buses out.

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,800
See you later, Stan.

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
Come on, hurry up,
you're 20 minutes late.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
So what?

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
You think you can do what you like

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
with the buses, don't you?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
Yeah.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
Go and get in that cab and out of it.

64
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
I've had just about as much as I can take

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
from you two mutinous dogs.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
You're defying me and breaking
every regulation in the book.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm making out a special
report about you two.

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Hang about, don't let your driver go,

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,800
'til I've checked your way bill.

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
God.

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Hello, Susy, love.

72
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Oh, hello.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,600
Well, let me have a look at it.

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, very nice.

75
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Stand up then.
-Eh?

76
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Come on, stand up.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, well, you got it well
in time then, doesn't show.

78
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,800
It's not like that.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
Innit? Ooh, you clever girl.

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,800
Listen, take a bit of
advice from me, dearie,

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,600
don't give anything away until it's legal.

82
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Well, I have got an engagement ring.

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Look, love, I've got
five engagement rings,

84
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,000
but no husband.
-What happened?

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,600
I'm too generous, especially
after a few gins.

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
Susy, love.

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Hello, Stan.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
Cor, I haven't half missed you.

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
So have I, oh.

90
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Here, it's like catching a fish.

91
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
She keeps dangling the bait,

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,800
but she won't let him have a nibble.

93
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
-Stan.
-Yeah.

94
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,400
Have you found anywhere
for us to live yet?

95
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Yeah, it's all fixed. Mum
said we could live with her.

96
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Oh no, I'm not having that.

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
I'm not getting married until
we've got a place of our own.

98
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, innit marvellous?
I thought you'd be pleased.

99
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
I mean, flats are not
easy to come by or houses.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
I mean, you just can't pick
them up like that, you know.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
You don't wanna wait, do you?

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
No, of course I don't, darling, but

103
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
But just think all the fun we'll have.

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Ssh, not in front of the
fellas, careful now, look.

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Just the two of us alone.

106
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
- I know, I can't-
- Anytime.

107
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
-Darling, look.
-Any place.

108
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Yeah, alright then, I'll
tell Mum. She won't mind.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Well, I don't know how I'm
gonna manage when you go.

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
Well, I can't stay
here forever, Mum, can I?

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Especially when I get married.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Well, I don't know
why just for the start.

113
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,600
I mean, you've got a lovely home.

114
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Oh, go on, darling, do it for Mummy.

115
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,200
Well, I can't afford to
keep your mother on me own,

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
not when I've got your sister
and the little one to support.

117
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Well, she gets her pension, don't she?

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
And I could chip in with a few bob.

119
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, I still think you
should stay here for a start.

120
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,400
I mean, Arthur and Olive
are very happy here.

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Does he have to do that
when I'm trying to eat?

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
What's the matter with him?

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He spends hours sitting on that pot.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Well, he's like his father, ain't he?

125
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,600
He's too mean to part
with anything.

126
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
How very funny.

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm getting a little tired
of your crude remarks.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Well, you won't have to put up

129
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
with them much longer, mate,

130
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
because soon as Susy and I find
somewhere to live, I'm off.

131
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, love, aren't you gonna
have your bread pudding?

132
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Smells delicious.

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Yeah, I think he's fighting
a losing battle.

134
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Oh, we're 10 minutes late,
we might as well push off.

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Yeah, okay, mate.

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Stan.

137
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Stan, look.

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Hello, Susy, love. I
didn't know you were back in.

139
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Look, I found some new flats for sale.

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,400
-Oh.
-Look, they're ready now,

141
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,400
50 pounds down, pay off 10 pounds a week.

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,200
-Yeah.
-You've got to put

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
your name down before they've all gone.

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,200
Yeah, I know, but it's a
lot of money, you see, love

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
and I'll have to think about it, you see.

146
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,800
Just fancy, Stan, the two of us.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Look, I know.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Alone.

149
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,600
- Look, but 50 quid is-
- A place of our own.

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
All right, I'll pop in on my way home.

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Oh, Stan.

152
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,600
Oh no, you two are not
at it again, are you?

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, you don't mind
me kissing him goodbye?

154
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Look, my dear, I wish to God

155
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
I could kiss him goodbye myself.

156
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh, Blakey, I didn't
know you cared, dear.

157
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Get that bus out, come on.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Bye.

159
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,600
Mum, Mum, I've got the
flat! Look, that's it there.

160
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm gonna take the deposit round tomorrow.

161
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
I've seen about the wedding
and with a bit of luck,

162
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I should be away from here in
about a fortnight.

163
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,400
What's the matter with everybody?

164
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Why's Olive crying?

165
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,400
Arthur's got the sack.

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
He's what?

167
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,600
I have not been sacked,
I have been made redundant.

168
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,400
Thank goodness you've
got a good, steady job.

169
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
We shall need every penny you can earn.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
But I'm getting married.

171
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,000
But you can't, not until
Arthur gets another job.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Well, blimey, if I wait
for him to get a job,

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll be past it.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
No, I'm sorry, Mum, I've
got my own life to lead.

175
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
It's the baby I'm worried about.

176
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,400
I won't be able to get him enough food.

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Well, if he didn't eat so much,

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,400
he wouldn't have to sit on
that thing all day long.

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Stan, how could you?

180
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Well, you know what I mean, Mum.

181
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Look, I'll see that none of you starve.

182
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
Oh God, what else?

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I suppose I'll have to go round

184
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
and tell them I can't take the flat.

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,400
Oh, I knew you'd see us all right, love.

186
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Well, now I'll go and make
the supper.

187
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I think I'll put baby in the high chair.

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,800
He doesn't seem to want to.

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
Come on, darling.

190
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,000
There you are, Mummy will
get you a nice clean nappy.

191
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
What's that?

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh, you naughty little boy.

193
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
You little rascal.

194
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,600
You never know what they're
gonna do next.

195
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
Here's a nappy.

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,800
You're too late, he's beat you to it.

197
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Well, you're
having a bit of a rough time

198
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,400
of it then, aren't you, Stan.

199
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,600
You can say that again, mate.

200
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm right up to here with it.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you realise if Arthur
don't find another job soon,

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,800
I can't get married?

203
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah. Morning, Hitler.

204
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
Here, who's this Mr. Jenkins, then?

205
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
That is the new general
manager who's been sent down

206
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,400
from the head office to
help me to sort you lot out.

207
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,600
From now onwards, mate,

208
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
these buses are gonna be
run properly at a profit.

209
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,200
At a profit? Cor blimey, that's a laugh.

210
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
We've heard all that before, mate.

211
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Yes, well, get in your bus
then. You're 30 seconds late.

212
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,400
-All right, all right.
-It's not all right.

213
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,200
-Inspector.
-Sir.

214
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm gonna take a look around outside.

215
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
I've been studying these time schedules.

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
Hardly any of your buses
seem to run on time.

217
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,400
I know, sir, I know, I do my best.

218
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,800
It's these drivers,
they're so uncooperative.

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
That number 11 should have left by now.

220
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, sir, I'll tell
them right away, sir.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't worry,

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,800
I will.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,200
Good.

224
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Here, I wonder what this
new manager's like then.

225
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
I don't know. Mind you,
I've got to watch it a bit.

226
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
-Yeah?
-Well, I don't want

227
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,400
any trouble now that I've
got all the family to keep.

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
Hey, you.

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Do you know what time this bus is due out?

230
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
No, we haven't made up our minds yet.

231
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
What?

232
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,400
Passengers have to
wait outside for the bus.

233
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
How long will the next bus be?

234
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
About 38 feet.

235
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
Having any trouble, Mr. Jenkins?

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Mr. Jenkins. Mr. Jenkins, oh.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Who are these two layabouts?

238
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Butler and Harper, sir, the
worst two in the whole depot.

239
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm always having trouble with these two.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Well, you'd better not have
any more, scruffy-looking pair.

241
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,600
What about that shower over there?

242
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
You lot!

243
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Come here.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,400
Come on, come on, we haven't got all day.

245
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
Look at them.

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,800
Now that I'm taking over here,

247
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,400
you lot are going to have
to smarten yourselves up.

248
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,400
You're in charge. Look at
them, they're a disgrace.

249
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
You know the regulations about uniforms,

250
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,400
in future, you'd better see
they stick to them or else!

251
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Right, you heard what the
manager said, from tomorrow,

252
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,000
you will wear only the company's
uniform as supplied, right?

253
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
Oh, it's ridiculous.

254
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,600
Is it, is it?

255
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm having no more of these
fancy shirts or filthy sweaters

256
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
or any of that flashy rubbish.

257
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,800
I mean, look at that, look, look.

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
I don't know how you can get
your hands on such things.

259
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
Oh, that's easy, I'll show you.

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Knock it off.

261
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
You lecherous moron,
you know what I mean.

262
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Right, from now onwards, you will wear

263
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,000
only the company's uniform as
supplied, nothing else, right?

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Nothing else?

265
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Nothing else.

266
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Here, now look here, Jack,
we're not standing for that.

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
Oh, don't you worry, mate.

268
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
If they think they can
order us about like that,

269
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
they've got another thing coming.

270
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,800
Ah, ooh, blimey!

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Cor, cor!

272
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,000
Here, I hope this works.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
Look, he told us to wear

274
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
nothing but our uniforms, didn't he?

275
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Well, that's what we're wearing.

276
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,200
Yeah, I know, but blimey!

277
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
This floor ain't half cold, innit?

278
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Ah, oh, ugh!

279
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
What's the matter? You
only trod in some sawdust.

280
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm not worried about the sawdust,

281
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
it's what's underneath it.

282
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Oh good, the other
fellas haven't let us down.

283
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah, oh, that's it, fellas, yeah.

284
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Have you seen Blakey?

285
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, he's snooping around somewhere.

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,400
God, I hope he hurries, with no vest on,

287
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
this jacket ain't half
irritating my chest.

288
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, well, if that's what
it's doing to your chest,

289
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
how do you think I feel?
-Eh?

290
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,800
I've got no underpants on.

291
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
It's all right for you to laugh,

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it ain't half irritating my, cor blimey.

293
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Oh, what are you, stupid or something?

294
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
I didn't tell you to leave everything off.

295
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
That's what you said.

296
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,600
No.

297
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,000
So the new discipline's
beginning to work then, is it, eh?

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
Yeah, nice to see the
first shift's here on time

299
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
for a change, innit, eh?

300
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
That's right, Blakey.

301
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,600
What the?

302
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Now what's going on here, eh?

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Now where's all your rest of your clothes?

304
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
You told us to wear
nothing but our uniforms.

305
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, but I didn't need mean
nothing but your uniform,

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I meant nothing but your uniform.

307
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,600
Morning, Inspector.

308
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
Morning, Inspector.

309
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Oh, morning, lovies.

310
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,400
Oh no.

311
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh no, not you and all.

312
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,400
Oh, it isn't half cold
with just this jacket on.

313
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Eh?

314
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Yeah, yeah, you,

315
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
you are wearing something
underneath it, ain't you?

316
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,800
Orders is orders, look.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
Do your jacket up, do
your jacket up, love.

318
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Ooh, I've got goose pimples.

319
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
He knows, you've just
shown him a couple.

320
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,400
Here, you're not all like that, are you?

321
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,400
We are.

322
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,600
What the hell's going on here?

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Well, it's the Inspector, sir.

324
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
He asked us to come to work
with no other clothes on.

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,800
He what?

326
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Ooh, I think he's lusting after me body.

327
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Him?

328
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,600
No, no, no.

329
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,000
Just tell him the truth, come on.

330
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
You told us to come to
work with nothing else

331
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,600
but our uniforms, didn't he?

332
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes.

333
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
You kinky or something?

334
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,400
No.

335
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Well, he does go a bit funny sometimes.

336
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
It's his age, he's a
bit on the turn, you know.

337
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Shut up.

338
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,200
You've had your fun.

339
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,800
I'll deal with you later.

340
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,200
And in future, I want
you lot coming to work

341
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
dressed like that.

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
Well, blimey, she's
gonna have a bit of a job

343
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,200
looking like that.

344
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
Here, I thought this
depot was fully manned.

345
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
I intend to expand the services

346
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,000
and I shall need some new drivers.

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
Come into my office.

348
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
And you lot, put your clothes
on and get back to work

349
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,400
or I'll sack the lot of you!

350
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,400
I'll get you two for
this, you see if I don't.

351
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Hello, Susy, love.

352
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Hello, Stan.

353
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
I thought I'd catch
you before you went out.

354
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,400
Here, Stan, I've been thinking,

355
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
your brother-in-law could
get a job as a driver.

356
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,800
-Who, Arthur?
-Yeah.

357
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Don't be daft, he can't drive.

358
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Well, you could teach him.

359
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Me?

360
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
When? How?

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
When you're out with your bus.

362
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Oh no, can't do that, no.

363
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
If you did, Stan, we could get married.

364
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah, well, I know that, but I mean...

365
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
You do want to, don't you, Stan?

366
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
Yeah, of course I
do, but do us a favour,

367
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,000
don't do that while I've
got this tight collar on.

368
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Look, mate, I'm not a complete idiot.

369
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,800
You've told me 100 times
already, let's get on with it.

370
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
All right, big head.

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm just gonna show him the gears, Jack.

372
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Yeah, don't be long.

373
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,200
Come on, get in.

374
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
Cor blimey!

375
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,400
I don't know about driving,

376
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,600
you can hardly get in it.

377
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Right now, make sure it's in neutral.

378
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
That's it, right, now start her up.

379
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,400
Right now then, have you got the idea?

380
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,200
Look, my dear good man,
I do drive a motorcycle.

381
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
Maybe, but this is
not a motorcycle, is it?

382
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
And I'm telling you now,

383
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
the clutch on this thing's a real brute!

384
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
Right, now stick it in gear.

385
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Oh, God.

386
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,000
Look, push the pedal right down.

387
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Right, that's it, now then,
let it up very slowly,

388
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
very slowly releasing the
hand brake at the same

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Stop, Arthur!

390
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Wait, stop, what are you doing?

391
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,600
Here, you, stop!

392
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,200
You mad or something?

393
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,400
Hey!

394
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Stop that!

395
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Arthur, stop!

396
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,800
Will you stop shouting at me?

397
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
You stupid idiot. Don't
you know the meaning stop?

398
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm trying to stop it!

399
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Hey, oh!

400
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,600
Are you all right, Stan?

401
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,800
Come on, give us a hand, Jack, come on!

402
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, pull him out, that's it, come on.

403
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
-Come on, mate.
-There we are.

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh, oh, oh!

405
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Blimey, you do half pong, mate.

406
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Ugh!

407
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
You idiot, what do
you wanna do that for?

408
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,800
I could've been killed!

409
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Yeah, well, at least you
fell in something soft.

410
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
Come on, Arthur.

411
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,000
Pew!

412
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Oi, oi, yeah, you, come on, come on!

413
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,000
Look out, mate.

414
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
Come on, why are you
so late, eh, come on?

415
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
Ah, well, we got held up in the traffic.

416
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
Right, I'm putting you
on report, the pair of you.

417
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,800
Up the office.
-Well, come on then.

418
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,600
We'll do it.

419
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,800
No, no, I want Butler and
all. Get him out of there.

420
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
Ah, in a minute.

421
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Yeah, look, Blakey, come on.

422
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I'll help you make out the report.

423
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,000
I want Butler, get him out of here.

424
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
Oh, oh no.

425
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
We've started that striptease
lark again, have we?

426
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
No, it's nothing like that, Blakey.

427
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Where are your trousers?

428
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Horrible sight, look.

429
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,800
What happened?

430
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
Ah, well, it was an accident.

431
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Yeah, yeah, it was an accident.

432
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
What kind of accident?

433
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, you know Badgers
Lane, there's no facilities.

434
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Service.

435
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,800
So he had to wander
off behind the bushes.

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
Yeah, that's it, yeah.

437
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Hey and I fell in a ditch.

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
In a ditch, yeah.

439
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,200
You sure it was a ditch? Pew!

440
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
I should get cleaned off,
if I were you, Butler.

441
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm putting you on
report, the pair of you.

442
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,600
Oi, Butler, I should cover my
legs up if I were you, mate.

443
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,000
It don't do nothing for you.

444
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm gonna kill Arthur,
getting him into this mess.

445
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Ah, well, don't give him
no more driving lessons.

446
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Well, I've got to, haven't I?

447
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Until he finds another
job, I can't leave home.

448
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,600
No, that's true, still,
I'll tell you what,

449
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,000
he'll be dead keen to learn now, won't he?

450
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I mean, he's got to
keep Olive and the kid.

451
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

452
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
He was telling me this morning,

453
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
he stays awake all night
worrying about them.

454
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Cor blimey!

455
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,000
Olive.

456
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,400
Olive!

457
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Your baby's crying.

458
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,800
Well, go and see what he wants.

459
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
There, there, never mind.

460
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Why does he have to keep on

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
balling like that all the time?

462
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
I never got a wink of sleep.

463
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,800
What do you mean? The
poor little mite's crying,

464
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
'cause you woke him up
with your rotten snoring.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
I do not snore.

466
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,800
Yes, you do, you shore
like a great fat pig.

467
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I do not.

468
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes, you do, all night.

469
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
Here, look, you've
started him off again!

470
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,200
You stupid, great, fat lump!

471
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Don't you be so rude.

472
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
Why do you always speak to me like that?

473
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,600
You do snore all night
long!

474
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,200
What's the matter with you?
Can't you do anything right?

475
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,200
Arthur's getting very good, isn't he?

476
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,200
Well, he's been at it for
three weeks, he should be.

477
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
You'll never learn.

478
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,800
Now, back it up to the
stop and be careful!

479
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Don't worry!

480
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,800
Right!

481
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
-Arthur, Arthur!
-Stop!

482
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Arthur!

483
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
You great big nit!

484
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
That put the
wind up you, didn't it?

485
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,800
You nearly hit that bus stop!

486
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,000
Look, mate, I know what I'm doing.

487
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
Yeah, of course he does.
He's very good really.

488
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,600
Here, come on, Stan,
look, we're due out.

489
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah. Now pull it down a
bit and get out of that cab.

490
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
All right, all right.

491
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
No, no!

492
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,800
Oh God. Look what he's done!

493
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,400
Oh, dear.

494
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,800
You big headed nit, you and
your "I know what I'm doing."

495
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Look what you've done,
you left it in reverse!

496
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Oh no, I didn't, the gear slipped.

497
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
No, I'll
tell you what we'll do,

498
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
we'll lift it up and stick
it back in the pavement.

499
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Oh, don't talk out of
the back of your head.

500
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,800
You'd need an elephant to lift this up.

501
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,200
Olive.

502
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Give them a hand.

503
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,800
Stop being funny. Now
let's get out of here.

504
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
Just one moment, mate.

505
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
What are you gonna do about the post?

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,400
Oh, we'll say some hooligans did it.

507
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,200
A lot of stupid louts doing
things like that these days.

508
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
You're right.

509
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
I've just seen one.
-Yeah.

510
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,800
Why don't you belt up?

511
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,200
Come on, Olive.

512
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll drive us home, Arthur.

513
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,000
Here, just a minute.

514
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,200
I didn't know Olive
could drive a motorbike.

515
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, Arthur's teaching
her, so she can pick him up

516
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
at the depot when he's on late shift.

517
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,800
Oh yeah, well, I tell you what,

518
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,200
if those two are gonna be on the roads,

519
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
I'm taking a job on the railways.

520
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,800
Here, let me do that.

521
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,800
No, I've got to learn.

522
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Look, you've got no idea,
you need a special knack.

523
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,400
Now come on.
-No, I can do it.

524
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Leave me alone.

525
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
What happened?

526
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,600
You stupid great lump,
now look what you've done.

527
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,200
You've broken the starter, haven't you?

528
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,800
How can you be so clumsy?

529
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,200
Clumsy? Hark who's
talking, who did that?

530
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,800
Nevermind about that! This
is gonna cost us money, innit?

531
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
-What's he done now?
-What's happened?

532
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
Well, look at that.

533
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,000
You're gonna have to lend me a few quid

534
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
to get the bike home.
-What?

535
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,400
Oh no, there must be another way.

536
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
Jack, me steering's gone all stiff!

537
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,000
Look!

538
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Arthur, look out!

539
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,600
There's nothing I can do about it!

540
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,400
Arthur!

541
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,200
Arthur, oh!

542
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,600
Get off!

543
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Watch, watch out!

544
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Arthur, help, help!

545
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Olive, are you all right?

546
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm stuck!

547
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,800
Good, well, don't move.

548
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,400
I'll go and see if Arthur's all right.

549
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,600
Yeah, come on.

550
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,000
Arthur!

551
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Come on, pull the tent
up, pull the tent up!

552
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
Get him off me!

553
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,800
Cor blimey, Olive's changed.

554
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,400
Here!

555
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,200
Where is she?

556
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,600
All right, don't
panic, Olive's all right.

557
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,800
What do you think you're
doing bunging up my hole?

558
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,600
Arthur!

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,400
Cor, you don't half get some daft ideas.

560
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Well, I had to help them out, didn't I?

561
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,800
Oi, oi, late again, eh?

562
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Every mortal time you get
back from that Badgers Lane,

563
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,400
-you're late, ain't you?
-Well, it's all the traffic, innit?

564
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,800
Oh, traffic, my eye.
You never leave there on time, do you?

565
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
I've got something says
you do it in future, mate.

566
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,200
-What's that then?
-Come and have a look.

567
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,200
Here you are.

568
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
What's all that for then?

569
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
That's radio control.

570
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
Mr. Jenkins is having that
installed to improve efficiency.

571
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,000
From next week, every bus
is gonna have that fitted.

572
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I'll be able to keep in touch all day.

573
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, God, that's all we need.

574
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Yeah.

575
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,200
There'll be no arriving early
at the turn-round points

576
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,800
and having a kip, no
leaving late and dawdling.

577
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,400
I won't give you a minute's
peace all day.

578
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,400
Where on earth have you been?

579
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
I've been waiting hours
for me driving lesson.

580
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,800
Look, since we got this
radio controller in the cab,

581
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
it's not easy!

582
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,000
Right, now get in.

583
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Inspector Blake here.

584
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,000
SB17, have you arrived at
Badgers Lane turn-round yet?

585
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,600
Blimey, not him again. See what I mean.

586
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,000
Stan Butler in number 17, just arrived.

587
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,400
Well, get back in your cab
and drive off again then.

588
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
Eh?

589
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,200
The bus in front of
you has just broken down.

590
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,000
What?

591
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,600
Here, there's a queue about a mile long

592
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,200
waiting at the central station.

593
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,600
That'll keep you busy, won't it?

594
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, blimey, Jack, I'm fed up with this.

595
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,400
You got the message, then,
have you? Any comments?

596
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,800
Yeah, only one!

597
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,200
A little interference, I think, sir.

598
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, this is hopeless.

599
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
How on earth can you
give me driving lessons,

600
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,800
when that Inspector of yours

601
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
keeps dragging you back to work?

602
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
He's right, you know, Jack,

603
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
we've got to do something
about this radio here.

604
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,400
If the bosses can order us
about like this all day long,

605
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
life won't be worth living.

606
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Yeah, you're right, mate.

607
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Hurry up, Jack, before
Blakey comes back.

608
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah, all right, all right.

609
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Look, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

610
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Look, I was on radios when
I done me National Service.

611
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
I've re-tuned all the circuits.

612
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Here you are, he'll
never get through to us

613
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,000
on these wavelengths.

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Oh look, we'd better scarper.

615
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Get the bus out early.

616
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,600
Well, don't mess about, come on.

617
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
Yeah, right.

618
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,400
Ah, we're off then now, Blakey.

619
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Right.

620
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,200
You mean you're actually
going out on time?

621
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,200
Yep.

622
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
Well, I knew there'd be some changes,

623
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
once I had that radio control,

624
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,200
but I'll be checking up on
yous in half an hour's time.

625
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,600
-Righto.
-Yep.

626
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,200
That's made my day, that has.

627
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Hello?

628
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,800
SB17, can you hear me?

629
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,400
SB17, can you hear me?

630
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,400
Hello, SB17, can you hear me?

631
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
TS14 here.

632
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
147

633
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh.

634
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,400
Where are you then?

635
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,200
We're parked behind the Rose and Crown.

636
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,800
What? What are you doing there?

637
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,400
Stopped here last night

638
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
and picked up a couple of drunken tarts.

639
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Tarts?

640
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah. We thought we might
find a couple more here now.

641
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
What, have you gone mad?

642
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
You're supposed to be
going to the Gasworks.

643
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Gasworks?

644
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,800
Who's that speaking?

645
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Your Inspector.

646
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,000
Inspector, must be something big.

647
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,400
Don't you get talking back to me.

648
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
You get down to the Gasworks right away!

649
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes, sir. Gasworks.

650
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
Sorry about that, sir.

651
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
I'll tear them off a
strip when they get back.

652
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,800
Don't mess about, get
hold of that Stan Butler.

653
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Yes, sir. Hello, Butler,
this is Blake calling.

654
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Forgot to press the button, sir.

655
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Hello, Butler, SB17.

656
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
SB17,

657
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
can you hear me?

658
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,400
Number 23 here.

659
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,200
237

660
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,000
You keep getting the wrong
buses. Where's that one going?

661
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
23, where are you?

662
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm on my way back to the station.

663
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,200
Station?

664
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
23, you shouldn't be to the station,

665
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
you should be going to Barley Common.

666
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
That's four miles away.

667
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,400
Don't you answer me back.
This is your Inspector calling.

668
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
You get down there double quick!

669
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,800
Why, yes, yes, I'll
c-catch a bus right away.

670
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,400
Don't you know how to work this thing?

671
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Well, it seemed all right when

672
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,000
Give me that mic.

673
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,200
SB17, can you hear me, can you hear me?

674
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,600
SB17, can you hear me?

675
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,400
Can you hear me?

676
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,800
SB17, can you hear me?

677
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,600
Clipper, Charlie Victor 2-7 here.

678
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Clipper, Charlie Victor 2-7
here. I'm receiving you, over.

679
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Charlie Victor?

680
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Have we got a Charlie Victor
working for us? Check that.

681
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,800
Charlie Victor, where are you?

682
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Clipper, Charlie Victor here.

683
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm approaching London Airport.

684
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,800
What? What route do you think you're on?

685
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,200
I've just come in from Calcutta.

686
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,400
Calcutta? They're all taking
the mickey, it's planned.

687
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,800
You haven't got any
control over your staff!

688
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,400
Number 14 reporting, Inspector.

689
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,800
We just got to the Gasworks.

690
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,200
Gasworks? Right, well, you're late.

691
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,000
So you get right back here to the depot.

692
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,600
Get back?

693
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
What depot?

694
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
The bus depot, you moron!

695
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,400
How do you expect me to run a bus service

696
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,800
with you lazy dolts?

697
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,400
Now you come straight
back here to the depot,

698
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,400
report to Inspector Blake!

699
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Don't you worry,

700
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,200
we'll be at that depot before you know it.

701
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,800
The depot.

702
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,600
And what's more, you could be charged

703
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,400
with impersonating a police inspector.

704
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,800
You could get five years for that

705
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,200
and transmitting on a
government frequency,

706
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,200
that could be another 18 months.

707
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Here, I wasn't the only one who was

708
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,000
Eh?

709
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
I'm making a full report.

710
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,000
In the meantime, this
transmitter is not to be used.

711
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,400
Understood?
-Oh, definitely, yeah.

712
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,200
Don't worry, Officer, I'll see to that.

713
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,400
Yeah.

714
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,600
Stan!

715
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,000
Hello, Susy, love.

716
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Come here.

717
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Did you manage to give
Arthur another driving lesson?

718
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Yep.

719
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,200
Yeah, ever since we fixed
Blakey's radio, it's been easy.

720
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
Will he get the job soon?

721
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
Well, he's got his
interview tomorrow morning

722
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
and he promised he'd stay up all night

723
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
learning the Highway Code.

724
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Arthur, you're snoring.

725
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Turn over, you'll wake the baby.

726
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,200
Arthur, turn over.

727
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,000
Get off your back.

728
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,600
Have you gone raving mad?

729
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
You were snoring.

730
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,600
You've woken the baby.

731
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
I didn't wake him, you did.

732
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,800
What's the matter with him?
Go and see what he wants.

733
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,400
You go, he's your child.

734
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,400
Look, shut up.

735
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,000
Will you shut up?

736
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't you dare do
that. Get away from cot!

737
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,400
Mum!
-What's going on?

738
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,400
Will you two shut up?

739
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,800
It's Arthur.

740
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
Will you two keep quiet?

741
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Me and Mum's trying to
get some sleep, you know.

742
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,200
It was Olive, she went
berserk, starting to attack me.

743
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I was only trying to turn him over.

744
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
You're wasting your time,
he's the same both sides.

745
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,000
-Stan.
-Well.

746
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,000
It was to stop him snoring.
He's waking the baby.

747
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,400
I know, I've heard him.

748
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,200
If you ask me, there's
something wrong with his tubes.

749
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,600
There is nothing wrong with my tubes.

750
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Then you must have an
obstruction up your nose.

751
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
I do not have any obstruction.

752
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Oh, come off it, mate.
What about your operation?

753
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,200
Oh, that obstruction wasn't up his nose.

754
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,800
It's his nasal passages,
they're tightening up a bit.

755
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Hm, what a load of old rubbish.

756
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,000
It is not a load of rubbish.

757
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,400
As you get older,

758
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,800
you shrivel up a bit.

759
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,600
I have not shrivelled up.

760
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Oh, I don't know, love,
I mean, I have noticed

761
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,200
Will you belt up?

762
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,400
And you two, clear out of here.

763
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Can't a man have some
privacy in his own bedroom?

764
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,000
You stupid great idiot!

765
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,600
Why don't you empty this thing?

766
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,600
She don't have to now,
you've just done it for her.

767
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
I hope Arthur gets that job.

768
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
Blimey, the things I went
through teaching him to drive.

769
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,200
Nevermind, darling,
I'll make it up to you.

770
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,800
Oh, at it again, are they?

771
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,600
Look at them nibbling and
licking one another, ew!

772
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
All right then, knock it off.

773
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,000
Of course, I couldn't have
done it without old Jack here.

774
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
I mean, somebody else would've shopped me.

775
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,400
No, it's nothing, mate.

776
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, I am grateful, Jack. Here.

777
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,600
She's chucking it
about a bit, ain't she?

778
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,200
God help us in the hot weather.

779
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Cor!

780
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,400
-Stan, Stan.
-What?

781
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Well, that's it, I have been accepted.

782
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Have you? Oh, that's marvellous!

783
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,200
Here, Susy, he's got the job.

784
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,800
Oh, smashing. You are a pet!

785
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,800
She can't leave it alone, can she?

786
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,200
Ooh, put me right off my
pudding, that has. Oh.

787
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,000
-Blakey.
-Eh?

788
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,600
Arthur got the job as a driver.

789
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Eh?

790
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,600
No. Oh, my God, not another
one out of the same family.

791
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
Oh, oh, that's done it.

792
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I, ah, I was told to give you this.

793
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,000
Eh?

794
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,200
Yeah, did it all right.

795
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Oh, well, you'd better go up the stores

796
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,000
and get yourself issued with
a new uniform, hadn't you, eh?

797
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,800
Report back here for training duties.

798
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,800
Righto, sir.

799
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,600
Dum dee dum dum dum

800
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
There's a good boy, do it for Mummy.

801
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,400
Oh, there's Stan. I'll get his tea.

802
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Hello, Mum.

803
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,200
Hello, love.

804
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Hello, Olive.

805
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,400
Hello, my sweetheart.
-Ah!

806
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Here, did you hear about Arthur?

807
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Yes, innit wonderful? Here,
I knew he'd get the job.

808
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah.

809
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,800
He's just gone up to
try on his new uniform.

810
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,000
Has he? Here, Mum, get
us a cup of tea, will you?

811
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,200
Well, how do I look?

812
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, that's great, that is.

813
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,000
I like the overcoat. Where's
the jacket?

814
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,400
Oh, don't be stupid, this is the jacket,

815
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
just needs a little
alteration, that's all.

816
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,400
Happen to have rather short arms.

817
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, I can see that.

818
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,200
By the length of that jacket,
you've got short legs and all.

819
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,600
Oh look, baby wants to see Daddy.

820
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Yes, there we are.

821
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,200
Oh, ain't he sweet.

822
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Sweet? Well, I wouldn't
have said that.

823
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,000
I think he wants to
put his daddy's cap on.

824
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh, yes. Here
you are, son, there we are.

825
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
Oh, he's a little poppet.

826
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,800
Here, Stan, perhaps one
day he'll be a bus driver.

827
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah, well, he's getting

828
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,200
the right sort of training, isn't he?

829
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,600
He spends most of his time sitting.

830
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,200
Well, he can't help that.

831
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,800
I'll get your teas.

832
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,000
Olive, do you mind putting
him down on the floor there?

833
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,200
I don't fancy eating my tea
with him on his pot up there.

834
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,200
Oh.

835
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Here, Mum, will you have him?

836
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yes, come on, my lovely.

837
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,800
Here we go.

838
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,600
Well, now that Arthur's
bringing the money in each week,

839
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,000
I'll be able to put my 50
pound down for the flat.

840
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,600
Well, I still think you could stay here

841
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,000
for a bit at first.

842
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,200
And I think your Susy's
being very unreasonable.

843
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Now look here, Mum,

844
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
I can't start my married
life in this house,

845
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,000
not with Arthur snoring
his head off all night

846
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,400
and little Arthur sitting
on the pot all day.

847
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,400
Oh, Arthur, look.

848
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Eh?

849
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,200
Blimey, look, he's
sitting on my new cap.

850
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,000
Little darling, ah!

851
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,800
Oh, love.

852
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Oh, Arthur.

853
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
My new cap. I'll kill him.

854
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,000
Now, don't do your nut. He's
just christened it for you.

855
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,800
It'll have to go to the cleaners.

856
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,600
No, wear it, it might make
your hair grow.

857
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,200
Well, poke me belly in, come on,

858
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,200
let's get some lunch quick.

859
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,600
No, I'm skipping it today.

860
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,200
Look, we agreed we was
gonna practise at darts.

861
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Blimey, mate, the match is on Saturday,

862
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,600
we've only got a few days to go.

863
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,000
Look, I'm going to the
estate agent's with Susy.

864
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
I've got the 50 quid deposit.

865
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Stan!

866
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Sorry I kept you waiting.

867
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,400
Here, look, you're
supposed to be practising

868
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,200
for the big night.

869
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
What do you think I'm doing now?

870
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,000
Not 200 quid, I thought
it was only 50 pounds.

871
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,600
Look, love, there's
nothing I can do about it.

872
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,400
I haven't got enough of the deposit.

873
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,600
You promised we'd only have to wait

874
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
until Arthur got a job.

875
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,000
But I didn't know the
price was gonna go up, did I?

876
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
I'll have to save a bit more, that's all.

877
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,600
Look, I've got to get back,
I'm gonna catch this bus.

878
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Well, I'll see you sometime.

879
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah, all right.

880
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,200
Lousy, rotten buses!

881
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,800
Here.

882
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,600
Right, double 61, mate, should be easy.

883
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,400
All right.

884
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Oh, blimey! Look, you're busted.

885
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,400
Look, can't you concentrate?

886
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Fat lot of use you'll
be at the darts match.

887
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Oh, I'm sorry, mate, but
what with the estate agent's

888
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,800
and Susy and everything,
I'm absolutely fed up.

889
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,200
Oh, forget it.

890
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Look, it won't do your Susy
any harm to wait a bit.

891
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Certainly not doing me darts any good.

892
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,800
Well, I can see that, can't I?

893
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,800
Here, what about those fish and chips.

894
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
Are they hot enough yet? I'm starving.

895
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,000
Should be.

896
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,200
No, not even warm.

897
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,400
Well, start the engine
up, that'll do it.

898
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,000
Here, wait a minute, we're due off.

899
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Oh, it don't matter.

900
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
No, you're right.

901
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,800
Anyway, who's gonna know?

902
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,200
The next bus isn't due

903
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,600
and Blakey's not gonna walk here, is he?

904
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,200
You're right there.

905
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,600
Blimey, who's that?

906
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,400
God, it's Blakey. Quick, get down, mate.

907
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Hurry up, we'll have to stall him off.

908
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Quick.

909
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,200
I caught you, didn't I, I caught you?

910
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,000
You were supposed to have left
this point 10 minutes ago.

911
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Yeah, I know, but you
see, I had a bit of trouble.

912
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,600
That's why I'm running the engine.

913
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,400
-Yeah.
-Oh.

914
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,000
But it's all right now.

915
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,800
Oh, see the van?

916
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,400
The manager's give me that
so I can check up on yous two

917
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,200
any time I like, when you're
least expecting it, mate.

918
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,600
Better than radio control, innit, eh?

919
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,200
Right, you go back to the depot, mate.

920
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I'm getting on the bus with these two.

921
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,000
Come on.

922
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,800
What about the dartboard
and the fish and chips?

923
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh, leave it for now.

924
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
As soon as he gets off, you
stop and I'll get rid of it.

925
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,400
-Right.
-Come on.

926
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,000
Ah, Blakey, how far are you going?

927
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,400
I'm stopping with you all the way

928
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,200
back to the depot, ain't I?

929
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh no!

930
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oh, that's done it.

931
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,000
What's happening?

932
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,600
Ah, nothing, it's the-the
engine, it's running a bit hot.

933
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,400
Well that's not normal, is it?

934
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,600
I'd better get one of the
maintenance men onto it.

935
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,400
Smells a bit funny and all, doesn't it?

936
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
Quick, get the chips out.

937
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,200
Cor blimey, Jack, they're alight!

938
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,400
He's coming back, quick,
chuck them in the pit.

939
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,400
Oh, it's all right, Blakey,

940
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,200
I found out what the trouble was.

941
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
It was an oily rag on
the manifold, it's okay.

942
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Well, it smells a bit like a.

943
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,600
Oh my God, look, there's a
fire in the inspection pit!

944
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,200
Quick, get a fire extinguisher!

945
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Yes, sir.

946
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,800
Oh, God, wait.

947
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,600
Hurry up.

948
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Don't stand there like an
idiot, give us a hand, will you?

949
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,600
Come on, bring it over here.

950
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,600
All right.

951
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,400
Come on, hurry up.

952
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,600
All right, I've got
to read what it says.

953
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
"Stand nine feet away from the fire."

954
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,200
Where's nine feet?
-Back, back here.

955
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
-Right, yeah.
-That's about it, yeah,

956
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,400
that'll do.
-Yeah,

957
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,000
"Then point the nozzle at the flames."

958
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,400
Stand back, stand back, stand back.

959
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
What happened?

960
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,800
More, morel

961
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You can't get no more, that's the lot.

962
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,800
Oh, look at the flames!

963
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,600
Look, sound the alarm, quick!

964
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,800
Where, where is it?

965
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,400
Oh, it's lost its dinger.

966
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,800
Oh, oh. Look, that's gonna burn the bus.

967
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,800
Get the hose, quick and turn the water on.

968
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,800
Come on, you turn it on, come on!

969
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Hurry up, come on!

970
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
-Give it here!
-Turn it on.

971
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
I'll get it over there, ooh!

972
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,600
-Come on!
-Oh, oh, oh!

973
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,800
Hurry up, come on!

974
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,400
I can't, it's jammed, it's jammed!

975
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,800
Well, pull it harder then!

976
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,200
Wait a minute!

977
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,200
Oh, now look what you've done!

978
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,400
Don't, turn the water on!

979
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,000
I can't, it's rusted up!

980
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Oh!

981
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,800
Look at the fire, it's
spreading, look, oh!

982
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,200
Don't panic, don't panic!

983
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,600
I'll phone the Fire Brigade.

984
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

985
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
Look, what's going on here?

986
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,400
God, almighty, don't just stand there,

987
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
that bus will catch fire!

988
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,800
Now, come on, move it out of the way.

989
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Wait a minute, I'll get Jack.

990
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,200
You get into that cab
and back that bus out.

991
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,400
-Yes, I-I will.
-Go on, get a move on!

992
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,200
- Yes, sir, oh, and-
- And don't argue!

993
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,800
Oh, oh, God, oh, my God.

994
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,000
-Go on, back it out!
-Yes, sir, yes, sir.

995
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Get it moving.

996
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,800
Come on, before it goes up in flames!

997
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,600
Yes.

998
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,000
Come on, straight back,

999
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,400
keep it going, keep coming
straight back, come on now.

1000
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,000
That's right, that's very nice.

1001
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,600
Now keep it going, that's right.

1002
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,200
Oh God.

1003
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,400
What was that, eh?

1004
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,200
Butler!

1005
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,400
My new van, I've only just got it today!

1006
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,200
Well, it's all right,
they can straighten it out.

1007
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,200
Can't they?

1008
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,200
Oh, you, oh!

1009
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,400
Blimey, makes life very
easy for me, doesn't it?

1010
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,200
Just starting when my brother-in-law

1011
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,200
bashes in the company's new van.

1012
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,400
Look, it was an accident, wasn't it?

1013
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
My dear man, you should've looked.

1014
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,800
Don't you tell me how to drive.

1015
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,400
I've been 10 years at this
game, you know, so shut up.

1016
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Arthur, as you're on
the first route tomorrow,

1017
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,600
don't you think we should
have an early night?

1018
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,200
Eh?

1019
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,600
Yes, all right, sunshine.

1020
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,200
That's a good idea.

1021
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,000
Ah!

1022
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,600
Goodnight, Mother-in-law.

1023
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

1024
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,800
Goodnight.

1025
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,800
Oh, ain't it lovely, eh,
married all these years

1026
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,600
and it's made no difference to their love?

1027
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,800
Yeah, you're right.

1028
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,600
Two minutes and he'll be
snoring his head off.

1029
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Of course he won't, anyway,
Olive's thought of something

1030
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
to stop him sleeping on his back.

1031
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,600
Here, I can't find my
pyjama jacket anywhere.

1032
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,600
Oh, no, love, it's here.

1033
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,400
Oh, thank you.

1034
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,800
Dee dee dee dee

1035
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Dee dee dee dee

1036
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,200
Here, there's some things on my back.

1037
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,800
-Oh yes, love.
-Well, what are they?

1038
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,600
Balls.

1039
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,400
What?

1040
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Tennis balls.

1041
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,000
It's to stop you snoring so
you won't sleep on your back.

1042
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,800
Have you gone raving mad? Take them off!

1043
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
You think I'm going to bed

1044
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,000
with those things stuck on me back?

1045
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,200
But they're supposed to work.

1046
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,200
Take them off!

1047
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,600
Mum, Mum!

1048
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,600
You must be out of your mind, girl.

1049
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,000
What is it, love?

1050
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,600
Mum, he won't wear them.

1051
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,600
But it always works, Arthur,

1052
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,000
it's to stop you waking the baby.

1053
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,800
You look like the Hunchback
of Notre-Dame.

1054
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,400
That's it, that is it.

1055
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Take them off!

1056
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,800
I am not going to bed with
balls sewn on my pyjamas.

1057
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,000
Here, I'll tell you what, Arthur,

1058
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,200
if you don't want balls
sewn in your pyjamas,

1059
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,200
stick them in here and you
can wear this back to front.

1060
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,400
Shut up.

1061
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,600
I've been round to all the agents

1062
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,600
and there's nothing here I can afford.

1063
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,600
I shall have to save up
a bit more, that's all.

1064
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
Well, I suppose so.

1065
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,400
At this rate, we'll never get married.

1066
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,400
Oh yes, we will.

1067
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Oh, come on, cheer up, love.

1068
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Here, I tell you what, I'll
get you another cup of tea, eh?

1069
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,400
Two teas, love.

1070
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,400
Well, I have been
allocated my first route.

1071
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
The Inspector's put me with him.

1072
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,600
Yes, I'll get you a tea, my dear.

1073
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,400
-Oh, thanks.
-Two teas please.

1074
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,800
I'll get some fags.

1075
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,800
Cor blimey, fancy them
giving you Nymphy Norah.

1076
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,600
Why, what's wrong with her?

1077
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,600
What's wrong with her?

1078
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,400
She's worn out more drivers
than the five o'clock rush hour.

1079
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,000
Well, the Inspector told
me that if I left it to her,

1080
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,200
she'd show me where to stop.

1081
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,600
Cor blimey, if you leave it to her,

1082
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,200
she won't stop 'til you
get there.

1083
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,600
It's been so long since he's been there,

1084
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,200
I don't think he knows the way.

1085
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,400
Here's your teas, mate.

1086
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,400
Oh, thank you.

1087
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,400
Here, are you coming
to the darts match then?

1088
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,600
Oh, I don't know, I've got

1089
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,000
Well, I want to go.

1090
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,600
You know, a driver always
has to take his clip pie.

1091
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,200
Come on.

1092
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,200
Oh, well, of course,

1093
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,600
I, ah, I must do what's expected of me.

1094
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,800
Come on.

1095
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,600
She'll kill him.

1096
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,800
If she don't, I know who will.

1097
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
How do you mean?

1098
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
I've asked Mum and Olive
to the match.

1099
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,800
Cor blimey, should be a
right old punch up then.

1100
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,200
Here you are, Mum.

1101
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,400
Are you enjoying yourselves?

1102
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,200
Oh, it's lovely, ain't it?
Here, what's happening now?

1103
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Well, the last game was
a draw, so it's a playoff

1104
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
between me and Jack
and Blakey and Jenkins.

1105
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Go, Jack.

1106
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,400
Stan and Jack are doing very well.

1107
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,200
So is Arthur with that clip pie of his.

1108
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,600
I don't know what he sees in that fat cow.

1109
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,400
Oh, he must be drunk, love,
making a fool of himself.

1110
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
She's not our sort.

1111
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
So common.

1112
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,200
Oh, manners. Here, I'll
go and sort him out.

1113
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,800
Arthur.

1114
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,800
My little Olive's very upset.

1115
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,600
She's been alone all evening.

1116
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,800
Cor blimey, when there is grub about,

1117
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,400
your little Olive is never alone.

1118
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,800
Now we've got them on the run,

1119
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,600
take your time, don't
let them fluster you.

1120
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,200
No, sir.

1121
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,800
Right now, darling, you
know exactly what to do.

1122
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, okay.

1123
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,600
You missed! Now pull yourself together.

1124
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,400
Okay.

1125
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,200
You're doing that on purpose, you.

1126
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,600
-Sorry.
-Nevermind, Blakey.

1127
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,200
Here, wait 'til they fix the light

1128
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,000
and then finish them off, Jack.

1129
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,800
Another one, my dear?

1130
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yes, please.

1131
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,200
Vodka and tonic and ah.

1132
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,400
He's buying her another drink.

1133
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,800
I'm gonna get him to buy me one too.

1134
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,600
No, no, love, you've had quite enough.

1135
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,800
Yes, I've had enough of her.

1136
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,200
Oh, now, Olive.

1137
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,600
How about buying me a drink?

1138
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,400
I will get you one in a moment.

1139
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,800
Will you kindly go and sit down?

1140
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,400
Here, smell my perfume.

1141
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,600
You're wasting your time,
dear, don't go to bed with him.

1142
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,600
The only thing he's got
that will keep you awake

1143
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,800
is his snoring?

1144
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
Will you shut up?

1145
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Blokes don't snore when
they're in bed with me, dearie.

1146
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,000
You don't have to tell
everybody, love, they all know.

1147
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,200
Oh, cheeky cow.

1148
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,400
Will you shut up?

1149
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Oh, my goodness, here are the drinks.

1150
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,200
Here you are, my dear.

1151
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,400
I'll have that, just
'cause you've got a job,

1152
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,200
you can't afford to buy drinks for her.

1153
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,400
Hey, don't you touch that?

1154
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,200
They're mine, I paid for that round.

1155
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,800
Oh, did you? Well, you can have it back,

1156
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,600
you tatty tart!

1157
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,200
You bitch! Look at that, I'm
soaked, it's ruined my dress!

1158
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
It's all right, it's only
a spot. I'll get a cloth.

1159
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,600
Can I have a cloth please?

1160
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,800
Oh, she'll take it off for you.

1161
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,400
She does for every other bloke.

1162
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,800
You think it's so funny, you have some!

1163
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Arthur, look, the slag, I'll kill her!

1164
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,600
Will you shut up, sunshine?
You're showing us up.

1165
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,200
Oh, shut up! I'll show you!

1166
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,000
Disgraceful behaviour, I
knew I should never have come.

1167
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,600
Oh, it's nothing, my dear,
just a misunderstanding.

1168
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,000
Here, you trollop, you
picked the wrong one!

1169
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Right!

1170
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,200
Now, Mum!

1171
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,800
Oh, son!

1172
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,600
Are you all right, love?

1173
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,600
Cor blimey, what happened to my head?

1174
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,200
You old bag!

1175
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,200
Oi, oi, will you cover yourself up?

1176
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
You're showing your vest.

1177
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,200
She called me an old
bag, I'll murder her!

1178
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,800
-Butler!
-For God's sake, stop!

1179
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,400
We'll all get the sack!

1180
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,400
Jack, Arthur, get her out of here!

1181
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
-Get hold of her.
-Take her out.

1182
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,800
-Come here.
-She called me an old bag!

1183
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,600
-Get them out of here!
-Let me go!

1184
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,000
Let me go!
-Mum, Mum, get her things!

1185
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,000
I know what's wrong with
you, my girl, you're on heat.

1186
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You want cooling down.

1187
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,600
You saw what she did?

1188
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm sorry about that, my dear.

1189
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,400
You come to my office,
there's another towel there

1190
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,000
and I've got some brandy in a bottle

1191
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,600
to help warm you up a bit.

1192
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,400
Blake.
-Yes, sir.

1193
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
Look after Mrs. Jenkins for me.

1194
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Come on, my dear, we'll dry
you up nicely in the office.

1195
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,600
Ah, shall we, ah,

1196
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,600
would you like to go and sit down?

1197
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
All right, come on, you two, come on.

1198
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,000
You're in this as well.

1199
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,200
Now listen, we've spent a lot of money

1200
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,400
installing this new firefighting equipment

1201
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,800
and each one of you men
has to learn how to use it.

1202
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,600
Hang about, we're busmen, not firemen.

1203
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,800
Don't you start, I've
agreed this with the union.

1204
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,000
If this place had gone up
in flames the other day,

1205
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,600
you'd all have lost your jobs.

1206
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Well, we're not having that again.

1207
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,800
The Inspector will take
you through the fire drill

1208
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,000
one shift at a time.

1209
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,000
I've been waiting for you two
to get back to make a start.

1210
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,200
We'll have to stay behind for an hour.

1211
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,400
I'll leave it with you, Inspector.

1212
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Yes, sir.

1213
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,200
All gather round and
pay attention, will you?

1214
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,000
Right, now, I want you all to read

1215
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,400
these instruction cards, right?

1216
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,200
Here you are, one each.

1217
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,800
Give them out, will you?
-Here you are.

1218
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,600
I'll shift the bus, we can make a start.

1219
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,400
Murder, innit? Arthur.

1220
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
-Yeah.
-You'd better go

1221
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,000
and phone Olive, tell
her you're gonna be late.

1222
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And for God's sake, keep the peace.

1223
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,000
Suppose you're right.

1224
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,200
"What do you do if a fire breaks out?"

1225
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,000
Run like hell.

1226
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,400
I'll be right behind you.

1227
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,800
Hello?

1228
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,800
Yes, it's me.

1229
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,600
Yes. It's Arthur.

1230
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,800
Well, what time will you be back then?

1231
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I don't know.

1232
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Look, look, you'll see me
when you see me, won't you?

1233
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,600
Look, I've got to go now.

1234
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,600
Yep, bye.

1235
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,400
Bye.

1236
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,600
Arthur says he's gonna be late.

1237
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,400
Eh?

1238
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
Yeah, he says they've got
fire drill down at the depot.

1239
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,200
A likely story. That's a
lie, if ever I heard one.

1240
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,600
They've never had any
fire drill down there.

1241
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,800
He ought to have thought of
something better than that.

1242
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,000
Do you think he's out with that woman?

1243
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,200
Well, of course and
the best thing you can do

1244
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,200
is get down there as quick
as you can and sort it out.

1245
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,600
Right, I'll go on the bike.

1246
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,400
Right, now you all know
the positions, right?

1247
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,000
Now then, I give the orders, right?

1248
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,600
Right, Butler, sound the alarm.

1249
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,600
Well, move then, come on!

1250
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,800
Come on, put it up now
in the air like that.

1251
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,800
There you are, left hand, hold it up.

1252
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,600
Hey, what's Blakey saying?

1253
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,800
He's trying to tell them
how to put the fire out!

1254
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
-Cor blimey!
-Hold it down there.

1255
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,200
Down there! The fire's down there!

1256
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,000
Oh, stop the bell!
-Eh?

1257
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,600
Stop the bell!I Stop the bell!

1258
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,200
Now, come on, run the hose
out to it, run it out!

1259
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,800
Butler, grab your appliance.

1260
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,400
-Eh?
-Grab your appliance!

1261
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,400
-Oh, yes, all right.
-Hurry up then, come on.

1262
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,200
Stand here, you. Right,
hurry up then, come on.

1263
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,600
Right, hold it properly.

1264
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,800
All right, all right.

1265
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Right, more hose, more hose.

1266
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Cor blimey, that caught
me right between the eyes.

1267
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,400
Oh, my goodness, that was
a most unfortunate accident.

1268
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
So was that.

1269
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,400
-Oh, God!
-Cut it out! Cut it out!

1270
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,800
Give me that thing here, babies.

1271
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,400
Here, you go and make sure everyone else

1272
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,800
in the building's heard
the alarm, will you?

1273
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,600
-Yeah, come on, Stan.
-Go on, clear off.

1274
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,800
You get the ladders and tell
the First Aid to stand by.

1275
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
Get that thing out of
my face and down there!

1276
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,000
How many more times have I to tell you?

1277
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,400
We're making out the fire's down there.

1278
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,200
Everybody out!

1279
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,600
Hey, you can't go in there.

1280
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,200
Why not? It's an
emergency, innit?

1281
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,200
Oh yeah.

1282
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,600
All right, come on, all out.

1283
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,600
Here, what are you doing? Get out!

1284
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,200
Ah, fire drill, Stan's got to save you.

1285
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,200
What?

1286
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,800
Oh, come on, save me!

1287
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,600
God!

1288
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,200
Here, Stan, help me!

1289
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,600
I can't, I've got me hands full!

1290
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,400
-Put me down!
-Get out of here!

1291
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,600
-Stan!
-Get out!

1292
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,800
We've warned everyone, Blakey.

1293
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,800
Oh good, right, now we're gonna pretend

1294
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,600
that there's a fire down in
the inspection pit, right.

1295
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,400
-Yeah.
-Now, Butler,

1296
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,600
I'm leaving you in charge
of the foam-making machine.

1297
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,200
You go and stand by the stop cock.

1298
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Stop that fire bell, will you? Oh!

1299
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,200
-Sorry, Blakey.
-Stop that fire bell!

1300
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,600
That's not the fire bell,
that's your telephone.

1301
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,600
Oh, I'd better go.

1302
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,200
Now don't forget, keep the foam

1303
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,800
directed into the pit, right?

1304
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,600
-Yes, all right.
-I'm gonna keep you lot

1305
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,600
here all night if necessary.

1306
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,600
Start it up.

1307
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,600
Right.

1308
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,600
Right, let's have a bit of vacuum.

1309
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,400
Yeah, there we are. Right, turn it on.

1310
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
Well, it's new,
it's a bit stiff, see.

1311
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,400
Oh, that's it.

1312
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,400
How's that, is that enough?

1313
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,200
Oh, blimey, that's nowhere near enough.

1314
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,200
Turn it on some more.

1315
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,200
Cor blimey, it's really blooming stiff.

1316
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,600
Come here, this will do it.

1317
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,800
There you are.

1318
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,000
That's better.

1319
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,400
Hey, that's great, that is.

1320
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,000
Hey, look at that, look!

1321
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,400
That's too much! I'm gonna switch it off!

1322
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,200
Yeah, okay.

1323
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,400
Where's the handle?

1324
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,600
I chucked it in the pit!

1325
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,400
You stupid idiot, how
am I gonna switch it off?

1326
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,200
Come on.

1327
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,200
Hurry up, hurry up, do something!

1328
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,200
Look at it!

1329
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
Oh, my God.

1330
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,200
Oi, what's going on in here?

1331
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,600
Switch it off! Have you gone mad?

1332
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
We can't switch it
off, we can't find it!

1333
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,200
Switch it off!

1334
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,400
We can't find it!

1335
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,400
Old Blakey's fallen in the pit!

1336
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,200
Don't muck about, he
might have hurt himself!

1337
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,800
Well, where is he?

1338
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,600
Blakey!

1339
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,200
Blakey!

1340
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,200
Blimey, he looks like
the Abominable Snowman!

1341
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,200
Come on, Blakey,

1342
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,400
give us your hand, I'll get you out!

1343
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,000
Here, Stan, where are you?

1344
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,400
Where are you?

1345
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,600
You all right, mate?

1346
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,600
Come on!

1347
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,400
Don't mess about! Stop
mucking about, go home!

1348
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,800
Come on.

1349
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,000
I can't get out!

1350
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,600
Here, give us your
hand, give us your hand!

1351
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,000
What the blazes?

1352
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
What are you playing at?

1353
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,600
You, get up there and turn
off that foam machine.

1354
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,800
Ah, we've a bit of a problem
there, we can't find it.

1355
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,400
What? You get up there
and find it and turn it off!

1356
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,400
Oh, yes, sir, right, sir.

1357
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,000
And that includes you!

1358
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,400
Well, of course, yeah, I'll go help.

1359
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,400
-Go on, get out!
-Help me!

1360
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,200
It doesn't turn!
-Arthur!

1361
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,200
That's Olive!

1362
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,200
What's she doing, has
she gone raving mad?

1363
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
I'm coming!

1364
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,200
Arthur!

1365
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,200
What do I do?

1366
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,800
Put your brake on!

1367
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,200
Watch what you're doing with my bike!

1368
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,800
Arthur, where's the brake?

1369
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,400
-No, no, argh!
-Olive!

1370
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,800
Oh no, oh, oh, he's gone down.

1371
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,600
Get me out of here!

1372
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,800
Get me out of here!

1373
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Arthur!

1374
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,600
Oh, help!

1375
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,600
Stop it, oh!

1376
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Olive, Olive, are you all right?

1377
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,400
Where are you?
-Where've you gone?

1378
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,600
Come on!

1379
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,200
Here you are, sunshine, give us your hand!

1380
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,600
This is your doing, Blake,

1381
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,200
I'd know your handiwork anywhere!

1382
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,000
-Butler did it.
-Oh!

1383
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,200
Get out of my way!

1384
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,200
Oh no!

1385
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,400
Isn't she a little beauty?

1386
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,600
That's more like it.

1387
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,000
I intend to make this bus
company show a profit.

1388
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,400
Here, Windsor Safari
Park, what's that then?

1389
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,200
Oh, it's a fantastic attraction

1390
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,800
and not very far from here,
it's just right for us.

1391
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,000
I guarantee that every seat will be full.

1392
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Of course, there'll be
more pay for the driver

1393
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,600
and plenty of tips.

1394
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,000
More money, now that's the job for me.

1395
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,800
You? You'll never get the
job, Butler, I'll see to that.

1396
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,800
It was all your fault

1397
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,200
you messed up my fire drill, didn't you?

1398
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,200
I told the manager you were
in charge of the foam machine.

1399
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,600
That's right, innit, Butler
needn't apply, need he?

1400
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,800
You're darn right he needn't.

1401
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,400
See, I'll see you'll never get

1402
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,200
one of these tours, Butler.

1403
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,000
That's the job you ought to have.

1404
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,600
We'd be all right then. More
money and all those tips.

1405
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,800
Yeah, well, it can't
be helped, can it, love?

1406
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,800
You're always getting
wrong with the bosses.

1407
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,600
You'll never get anywhere, you won't.

1408
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,800
- But look, love-
- Oh, don't "love" me.

1409
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,400
We'll never have enough to get
married at this rate.

1410
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,200
I must get back to work. I'd
better hang on to my job.

1411
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,200
But Susy.

1412
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,000
Ooh, right little madam, isn't she?

1413
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,800
Don't you start, it was your fault.

1414
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,600
You was the one that mucked
up that foam machine.

1415
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,400
She's gone off in a huff.

1416
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,600
A right mate you turned out to be.

1417
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,000
Hm, women, they cause
all the trouble, you know.

1418
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Yeah, you're dead right, mate.

1419
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,400
You stick to Nymphy Norah,

1420
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,800
at least you know where you stand.

1421
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,800
Norah? Right little gold
digger she turned out to be.

1422
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,200
Hardly he ever talks to me now.

1423
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,600
-No?
-No.

1424
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,800
She's found herself a a sugar daddy.

1425
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,600
Oh yeah, who's that then?

1426
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,000
Jenkins.

1427
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,600
No, you're kidding.

1428
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
Oh, I should know mate, I'm her driver.

1429
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,400
She stays back late with him every night.

1430
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,000
Does she? Oh, thanks
very much for telling me.

1431
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,600
Ooh, you are naughty.

1432
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,800
Look, it's gone 11.

1433
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,400
But fancy dragging me
here at this time of night.

1434
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
I still say it's a load of talk.

1435
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,400
Look, it's worth investigating.

1436
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,800
If we can get something on
Jenkins, we're laughing.

1437
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
See what I mean? Come on, give us a hand.

1438
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,000
Give us a hand.

1439
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,600
Oh, Mr. Jenkins.

1440
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,600
Here, come over here.

1441
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,200
Oh, you are naughty.

1442
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,800
Oh, I tore my tights.

1443
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,800
Oh, we'll get you a new pair
out of petty cash, won't we?

1444
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,600
Anyway, take them off.

1445
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,600
Here, let me help you.

1446
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,600
Oh, your hands are cold!

1447
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,600
Here, Jack, do you
think this is gonna work?

1448
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,400
Don't worry, mate, we got him.

1449
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,800
Come in.

1450
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,400
Oh, morning, sir.

1451
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,200
Yes, what do you two want?

1452
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,800
Morning, Mr. Jenkins.
how's Mrs. Jenkins?

1453
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,400
All right, very well, thanks.

1454
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,200
Yes?

1455
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,800
Well, we were in the
depot late last night.

1456
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,400
We wanted to have a word with you then.

1457
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,200
Last night?

1458
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,800
We didn't interrupt you.

1459
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,400
You were here in your office
busy with one of the clippies,

1460
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
Norah, wasn't it, Stan?

1461
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,400
That's right, Jack.

1462
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,800
Shut the door.

1463
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
What are you two after?

1464
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,800
Oi, Blakey, the manager
wants to see you straight away.

1465
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,400
Eh?

1466
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,200
Oh, oh, thanks.

1467
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,600
You wanted me, sir?

1468
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,400
Oh, come in, Blake.

1469
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,000
I picked the driver for
our first Safari Park tour.

1470
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,600
Oh, oh, really, sir?

1471
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,000
Yes, we want the best men
with a lot of experience.

1472
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,800
Oh, exactly, sir, yes,
that's what I think, sir, yeah.

1473
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,400
-So I picked Butler.
-Butler, sir?

1474
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
Hello, Blakey.

1475
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,200
Butler? But you can't! Why pick him?

1476
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,600
He's very experienced.

1477
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,800
Experienced? He's the worst
layabout in the whole depot.

1478
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
No, I'm not having it, sir,
no, no, he can't do it.

1479
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,200
Are you trying to give me orders?

1480
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh, no, no, no, sir, no,
but please, I mean, why him?

1481
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,200
Don't waste my time.
Butler is driving it.

1482
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,600
And you'll see that he's issued

1483
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,800
with one of the special uniforms

1484
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,400
and you and Butler are taking
the bus out on a trial run

1485
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,800
to the Safari Park tomorrow morning.

1486
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,800
Thank you, sir.

1487
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,400
Right, now we don't want any slip ups.

1488
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,800
The Windsor Safari Park is
a sensational chance for us,

1489
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,000
a terrific attraction.

1490
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,400
We're lucky they've allowed
us to take a tour there.

1491
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:06,400
Don't worry, sir, I've
got it all worked out there.

1492
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,000
You ought to be off.
Where's your driver?

1493
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Butler? Don't worry, sir.

1494
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,200
I sent him to change into his new uniform.

1495
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,400
Here he comes now, sir.

1496
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,400
-Hey, look at that then!
-Wahay!

1497
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,600
Cor blimey, look at
Sergeant of the River.

1498
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,200
How do I look, Jack?

1499
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,000
Oh, you look just like one of them.

1500
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,200
Here, don't forget your
handbag, will you?

1501
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,400
Hush.

1502
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,400
Oh, Stan, you look great.

1503
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,200
And isn't it marvellous?
I still can't believe it.

1504
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,200
Now we'll be able to get
that flat straight away.

1505
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,200
All right, come on, get away from him.

1506
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,600
Getting make up all over his
uniform, look at that, look.

1507
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,600
Right, get in your bus
and draw it up to the front.

1508
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
-Yes, sir.
-Blake, come into my office,

1509
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000
get your final instructions.

1510
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,200
Oh, Stan, isn't it lovely?

1511
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,000
You've got all that room.

1512
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,800
Here, where's the engine?

1513
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It's round the back.

1514
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,800
Here, I'll show you.

1515
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,200
There you are, there's the engine.

1516
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,200
Where?

1517
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,000
Inside here.

1518
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,400
That's why I've got all that
visibility in the front.

1519
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,800
Oh, I don't know how they do it.

1520
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yeah, it's good, innit?

1521
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
I'll show you something else, look.

1522
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,200
This is the emergency door.

1523
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
See that, you can get in this way as well.

1524
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,000
Oh.

1525
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,400
See.

1526
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,600
-Here.
-What?

1527
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,200
Give us a kiss while no one's looking.

1528
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,800
All right, then.

1529
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,600
Oh, don't, here, come on, get in,

1530
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,200
I've got to move the bus up.

1531
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,200
Oh, my God, I left the
emergency door open!

1532
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,400
I'll have to reverse it, just a minute.

1533
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,600
-Oh, Stan, Stan, quick!
-What?

1534
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,400
-Look!
-What's it done?

1535
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,800
What's it done?

1536
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I broke it.

1537
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,800
Butler, where are you?

1538
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,600
Oh, oh, the handle's a bit loose, innit?

1539
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,400
Well, it is an emergency door,

1540
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,800
it'll make it easier to open.

1541
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,000
Butler!

1542
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,400
Where are you?

1543
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,000
I've just been checking the bus.

1544
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,400
Right, now don't forget,
I want all details recorded

1545
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,000
and a full log of the journey.

1546
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,200
You make a mess of this job
and you're for the chop.

1547
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,600
Don't you worry, sir,
you leave it to me.

1548
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,400
You're the Town & District trial run?

1549
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,200
Yes, that's right, yes.

1550
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,000
Yes, we were expecting you.

1551
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,200
Follow the road round 'til
you come to the lions.

1552
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,800
I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

1553
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,600
Hey, look at that!

1554
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,800
Oh, yeah.

1555
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,800
Hey, hey, Butler.

1556
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,600
What?

1557
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,200
Look that one over there, look.

1558
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,200
What?

1559
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,000
Oh God, it's just like
you. It is you.

1560
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,200
Oh, very funny.

1561
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,800
Here, how about that one over there then?

1562
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
He looks like you.

1563
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Here, why are they so red?

1564
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,600
Well, it's the mating season, innit?

1565
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,400
Yeah, yeah and I think that
one fancies you.

1566
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,400
Shut up and drive on, will you?

1567
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,000
This bus been checked?

1568
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,600
That's all right, I checked it myself.

1569
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,200
We're very strict on security here.

1570
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Once you get in among the lions,
all doors and windows shut

1571
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,600
and don't stop, understood?

1572
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,800
Don't worry about that.

1573
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,200
And driver, if you break
down, sound your hooter.

1574
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,600
Our guards will come and get you out.

1575
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,800
Right, in you go.

1576
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,400
Oh, these are the big lions, these are.

1577
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,400
These are the man eaters.

1578
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,400
-Are they?
-Yeah.

1579
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,800
What do you wanna run over
that rock like that for?

1580
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
There was a big lion in
the middle of the road,

1581
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,400
wasn't there, I'd have run over him?

1582
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,800
Yeah, if he was a pedestrian,

1583
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,800
you wouldn't have bothered, would you?

1584
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,200
Cor, look at his teeth!

1585
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,600
Look at the way he's pulling

1586
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,600
that big piece of red meat to pieces!

1587
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,800
Yeah, we're better off in
here than out there with him.

1588
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Here, do you know what?

1589
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,400
If you ever came face-to-face
with one of them,

1590
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,600
you've had it, you know.

1591
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,800
-Yeah.

1592
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Well, can't you drive round him then?

1593
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,600
I can't, can I?

1594
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,000
Well, come on, he's gone
now. Come on, drive on, Butler.

1595
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:37,200
Do you hear what I say,
Butler? Drive on, come on.

1596
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,200
Drive on!

1597
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,800
Shut up.

1598
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:44,200
Don't you tell me to
shut up, Butler. Drive on!

1599
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,600
Hey, what's the matter with you now then?

1600
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,200
You look as though you've
seen a ghost or something.

1601
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,800
Drive on, Butler!

1602
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,800
It's a lion.

1603
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,600
I know it's a lion, don't I?

1604
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,800
The place is full of them, innit?

1605
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,600
No.

1606
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,800
Butler.
-What?

1607
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,400
We mustn't let him
see we're afraid of him.

1608
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,400
No.

1609
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,000
Of course not, no.

1610
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,400
Butler, sound your hooter.

1611
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,000
Here, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1612
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,200
Suppose, supposing he
don't like my hooter?

1613
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,200
Keep quiet.

1614
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,800
I think he's going.

1615
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,400
Yeah, I-I think he's going.

1616
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,600
-Thank God for that.
-Oh.

1617
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,400
He's coming back!

1618
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,600
-Upstairs, upstairs.
-Oh!

1619
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,800
No, me first, I'm the driver.

1620
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,600
-I'm the Inspector!
-Get off, get off!

1621
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,200
Oh, God!
-Get out of it!

1622
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,400
Quick, get out here!

1623
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,600
Butler, lions can't get upstairs.

1624
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,200
Oh, look, I'm getting out of here.

1625
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,400
-Oh, God, oh!
-Look at them!

1626
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,400
I'm getting back inside.
-It's all right, Butler,

1627
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,200
we're quite safe up here.

1628
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,600
Blimey, he's got me!

1629
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,000
He's got hold of me, argh!

1630
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,000
Ooh, hold on, Blakey!

1631
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,600
Oh, oh, I think he's gone.

1632
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,400
Are you sure?

1633
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:28,200
You go first, Butler, you're the driver.

1634
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,400
I think it's all right now.

1635
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,400
Hey, you!

1636
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,400
Come down here.

1637
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,800
I didn't know it was you.

1638
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
How dare you open that
door. Can't you read?

1639
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,800
Well, I can't understand
it, I thought it was shut.

1640
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,800
We've had your type here before.

1641
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,600
I shall make a full report to the manager

1642
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,800
and your company won't be
sending any more buses here,

1643
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,800
that's for sure.

1644
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,200
Now drive off and get out!

1645
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,600
Yes, yes.

1646
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,000
Ooh, it's cold.

1647
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,400
Didn't I tell Mr. Jenkins

1648
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,000
you shouldn't be allowed
to drive this bus?

1649
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,600
Didn't I tell him that?
-Well, don't blame me.

1650
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,400
It's a sure thing, innit, Butler?

1651
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,800
Whenever you drive a bus,
something goes wrong, doesn't it?

1652
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,800
I'll have to make out a
full report about this.

1653
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,800
I'll get the blame for it,
you know that, don't you?

1654
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,800
Here, I'll tell you what,
if you do get the sack,

1655
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,600
you can always get a job
as a lion tamer.

1656
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,600
Drive it out, drive it out.

1657
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
All right, all right.

1658
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,400
Cor, look at the size
of those elephants.

1659
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,000
Yeah, good job the doors are shut

1660
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,800
and they can't get in, innit, eh?

1661
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,400
Don't want any more animals
on the bus, do we, eh?

1662
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,400
-All right.
-Yeah.

1663
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,800
Blakey, come and help me, Blakey!

1664
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Ooh, ah, Butler!

1665
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,000
Blakey, come and help me, Blakey!

1666
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,800
I can't help you, I've
got one as well, haven't I?

1667
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,800
Watch it!

1668
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,600
Butler, oh, Butler,
oh, for God's sake, stop!

1669
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,600
What do think I'm trying to do?

1670
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,800
Butler!

1671
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,800
I'll have you for this,
Butler, you see if I don't.

1672
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,400
Shut up, he's pulling me wheel!

1673
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,000
Get off, get off!

1674
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,800
-Oh, oh, oh, my God!
-What are you doing?

1675
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,400
He's got his bum in me face!

1676
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,200
Look where you're going!

1677
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,400
I can't get away!

1678
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,200
-Get it off!
-Blakey, help me!

1679
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,800
I can't, I can't!

1680
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,200
Butler!

1681
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,200
Oh, oh, it's out of control!

1682
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,600
Oh, oh, stop the bus!

1683
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,400
I'm doing me best, ain't I?

1684
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,400
Oh, I hate you, Butler.

1685
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,800
Oh, look out!

1686
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,000
Stop, stop!

1687
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,400
What's going on here?

1688
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,000
Can't you drive this?

1689
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,400
Bus?

1690
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,200
He's the one.

1691
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,200
Look, I know everything went wrong,

1692
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,200
but Jenkins will give me
another job on them tours,

1693
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,200
I promise you.

1694
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,200
I don't believe you,
Stan. Why should he?

1695
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,000
Well, well, he will, you'll see.

1696
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,000
Look, I don't think we'll
ever get married at this rate.

1697
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,400
We might just as well forget it.

1698
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,200
Now, look, look, I've
had a word with Mum, see

1699
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,200
and if you come and live with us,

1700
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,200
look, we can get married
straight away, it won't be for long.

1701
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,600
No, it'll never work out.

1702
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,200
Well, look, I'll tell you what,

1703
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,200
when you finish work tonight,

1704
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,200
pop home for tea and
just let's talk it over,

1705
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,000
that's all I ask.

1706
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,000
Eh?

1707
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,600
Please.

1708
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,000
Well, as I was saying,

1709
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,400
I don't think little
Arthur would bother you.

1710
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,200
In fact, I don't think
you'd be seeing much of him.

1711
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,000
Well, you don't have to
see him to know he's around.

1712
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,600
No, well, Mum's right really.

1713
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,200
I mean, we'd be out most nights.

1714
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,600
Besides, my room's very cosy too.

1715
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,400
Oh, there's Arthur and Olive.

1716
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,600
They had to go up to town.

1717
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,600
Hello, Mum.

1718
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,800
Oh, hello.

1719
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,600
Hello.

1720
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,600
Hello, Susy.

1721
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,400
Hello, Arthur.

1722
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,800
I'm starving.

1723
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,400
Arthur and I have got
some news to tell you.

1724
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,200
You tell them, Arthur.
-No.

1725
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:15,000
Ah, no, no, I ah, I
think you'd better tell.

1726
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,000
Oh.

1727
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,000
Well, we've just been to the doctors.

1728
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,600
I'm expecting again.

1729
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,000
What, pregnant?

1730
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,200
Oh, what wonderful news!

1731
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,400
Yes, Arthur's ever so
pleased, aren't you, love?

1732
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,600
Yes, yes, very.

1733
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,800
Oh, well, that's it
then, we can't live here.

1734
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,200
Oh, I don't know, it
might be rather nice

1735
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,800
to have another little one.

1736
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,000
What, another Little Arthur?

1737
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,000
Well, it might be another Little Olive.

1738
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,800
God.

1739
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,600
Yes, well, of course it means

1740
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,400
that I am gonna have a lot more expenses.

1741
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,400
So I'm afraid you'll have to
chip in a bit more, Stanley.

1742
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,200
Me chip in a bit more?

1743
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,200
Don't worry, I won't stand in your way

1744
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,600
and here, you can have your ring back!

1745
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,200
That'll help pay for another potty!

1746
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,000
Now, now, Susy.

1747
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,800
Susy, don't!

1748
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,800
Let her go, son. She don't love you.

1749
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,200
I know that sort of girl.

1750
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,600
All she thinks about is
sex, sex and more sex.

1751
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
What sort of a life would that be?

1752
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,400
Marvellous!

1753
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,400
Here, Jack, Jack.

1754
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,400
-What's up?
-Wait a minute.

1755
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Listen, Jack, we'll have
to go and see Jenkins

1756
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,000
about a better job for
me, otherwise I've had it.

1757
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,400
Look, Susy, she-she, she gave
me the ring back last night.

1758
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,800
Look, so let's go and see
him straight away, shall we?

1759
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,800
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1760
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm afraid you've had it, mate, look.

1761
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,600
What's wrong, what's happened?

1762
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,200
Jenkins got the push.

1763
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,000
What for?

1764
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,400
Well, it appears he told his missus

1765
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,000
he was doing overtime last night.

1766
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,200
-Well?
-Well, she come in

1767
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,800
and caught him doing
overtime on the office floor,

1768
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,200
so she got him transferred.

1769
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,600
Well, that's it then, innit?

1770
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,000
Oh yeah, that's not all, mate,

1771
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,200
you wait 'til you hear
this, Blakey's gone.

1772
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,600
-Get out of it.
-Yeah.

1773
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,800
-He's got the push?
-Yeah, yeah.

1774
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,600
Are you sure?

1775
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,600
They've had a right old sort out, mate.

1776
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,200
Well, I won't miss him for a start.

1777
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,600
Who's taking his place?

1778
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,600
Oh, they've sent a new
bloke down from head office.

1779
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,400
Look, here he is, watch out.

1780
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,200
Come on, you, get that bus out.

1781
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,800
Here, we've got another one like Blakey.

1782
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,200
You're due out in two minutes.
You know the regulations.

1783
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,600
You should be carrying out your checks.

1784
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,200
Oh, we don't bother with those.

1785
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,200
You don't bother, why
don't you bother with them?

1786
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,000
Get on with it or I'll report you.

1787
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,000
God, he's worse than Blakey.

1788
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,800
Here, come on, we'd better show willing,

1789
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,800
let's get the bus out.
-No, wait a minute.

1790
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,000
That's another thing, we're
not on the same route any more.

1791
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,400
I'm on the 14s, you're on the number 11s.

1792
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Well, it's not my day today, is it, eh?

1793
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,000
I've lost me job, me girl
and now me best mate.

1794
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,400
Yeah, well, they say trouble
always comes in threes,

1795
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,800
so you should've had your lot by now.

1796
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,600
Well, I've had my fill.

1797
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
Ah, well, there's
always a silver lining.

1798
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,600
I tell you what,

1799
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,600
they've taken on three
smashing new clippies, look.

1800
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,200
Yeah, here, one of them
must be on with you.

1801
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,200
Go on, ask her.

1802
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,200
No, I don't like to.

1803
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,600
Go on, you're free
now. Get stuck in, boy.

1804
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,400
-Should I?
-Yeah.

1805
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,000
All right then.

1806
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,600
Hello, darlings, any one
of you on the number 11?

1807
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,200
Yeah, I am.

1808
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,000
Are you really? So am I.

1809
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,400
They said I was going out soon.

1810
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,000
So am I. We must be on the same bus.

1811
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,600
Yes, you'll like the number 11 route, yes.

1812
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,800
We get half hour's rest at the turnaround.

1813
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,200
-Sounds nice.
-Oh, it is.

1814
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,000
Ah, have you got a fella?

1815
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:37,800
No.

1816
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,000
Oh, this is the best
news I've had today.

1817
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,600
Come on, Butler, your
conductor's waiting.

1818
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,200
Yeah, I know, I've got her here.

1819
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,000
No, no, no, Butler,
not this one, that one.

1820
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Oh yeah?

1821
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,600
Blakey, no! Oh no, I can't stand it, no.

1822
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,600
Come on, darling, I'll
buy you a cup of tea.

1823
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,200
Oh, you a conductor, I
thought you got a sack?

1824
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,600
Yes, well, things
weren't going too well.

1825
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,600
They demoted me, I'm afraid.

1826
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,000
That's right, they put you on my bus.

1827
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,800
No, I'm sorry, no, oh
God, I can't take it.

1828
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,800
I thought that would make you laugh.

1829
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,200
Here, Blakey,

1830
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,800
I never thought I'd see
you become one of us.

1831
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,400
Don't worry, mate, I shall
never become one of yous.

1832
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,600
Cor blimey, a bit of a
comedown, innit?

1833
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,400
I'll show you lot how to do
this conductoring job, mate.

1834
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Oi, where are you going, where you going?

1835
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,800
We're not due out for another two minutes.

1836
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,400
Look, mate, I'm the
driver and I'm the boss

1837
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,200
and I go when I say.

1838
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,000
You'll go when I ring the bell, mate.

1839
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Well, get on and ring the bell then.

1840
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:46,000
Go on, Blakey's on the bus!

1841
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,400
Oh, I've had enough of this.

1842
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,200
No, no.

1843
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,400
Well, why can't we
get on? It's a disgrace!

1844
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,800
No, sir, no, it's not up to me.

1845
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,800
I can't let you get on
until my driver says so.

1846
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,400
Oh, God.

1847
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,600
You do love me, don't
you, you do love me?

1848
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,800
Yes, of course I do, of course I do.

1849
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,200
And you will marry me one day?

1850
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,000
Of course I'll marry
you, of course I will.

1851
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,600
Oh, darling, isn't it
marvellous? We're engaged!

1852
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,800
Yes, we're engaged.

1853
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,200
Here, just a minute.

1854
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,200
Now that you've asked me,
you can have another kiss.

1855
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,000
No, just a minute, Gloria,
you don't understand.

1856
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,800
Look, what I'm trying
to say is, I've got, oh.

1857
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,200
You don't understand what I mean, you see.

1858
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,800
Oh, Stan.

1859
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,400
I seem to remember
this happened before.

1860
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,400
Just a minute.

1861
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,400
What I'm trying to say to
you is, oh, ooh, Gloria.

1862
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,200
No, wait a minute, hang on.

1863
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,000
This is where I come in, you see.

1864
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,200
Oh, Stan.
