00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:22,179
Hi.

3
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,149
I'm Doctor Dave Robbin.

4
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:28,585
You've undoubtedly heard of me
and if not, why not?

5
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,157
And why are you watching
my Ten Steps to Nirvana?

6
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:38,795
I've won the Nobel Peace Prize
for psychiatry and psychology.

7
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,765
On top of that,
I'm a champion bodybuilder.

8
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:45,536
I once saved over a hundred
people from a sinking cruise ship

9
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:49,006
near Italy by commandeering
an army helicopter and

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,209
piloting it myself.

11
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:54,911
I've taken time out of my
busy schedule to help you.

12
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:58,349
Together, we can change your
life for the better.

13
00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:01,285
Not me... Us.

14
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:04,021
You're gonna have to do the
work, and you can.

15
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:07,591
By simply following my
Ten Steps to Nirvana programme.

16
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,361
I was once like you

17
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:12,362
an utter loser.

18
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:14,364
Poor... Degenerate.

19
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:19,302
I was hooked on everything.
Sex. Drugs. Drink.

20
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:21,405
All the good things in life.

21
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:23,406
But take a look at me now.

22
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,909
I'm the man that you want to be

23
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:29,881
and you can be, by following
the same ten steps that I did.

24
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,884
Because who's got time for
twelve?

25
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,954
All we need to get started is a
mirror.

26
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:41,391
Rule One is admission.

27
00:01:41,424 --> 00:01:44,762
You have to start by
acknowledging the problem.

28
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:46,763
Some of you will suffer with
this.

29
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:50,334
Some of you are not ready to
admit the truth.

30
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:52,403
That you are an addict.

31
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,639
Say it with me.

32
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,378
And that's it.

33
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:11,788
<i>I Am An Addict</i>

34
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:20,764
Someone's wide awake.

35
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,667
He's not the only one.

36
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:32,009
Do you love me?

37
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,978
Don't be silly.

38
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:35,945
Say it.

39
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,982
I love you.

40
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,652
Promise me you'll never
be with anyone else.

41
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:43,655
There's no-one else for me.

42
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,548
Why are you stopping?

43
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:54,158
<i>It's been months now.</i>

44
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,161
<i>John would've wanted you</i>
to move on.

45
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:01,098
<i>No, he doesn't.</i>

46
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,134
He doesn't.

47
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,002
<i>John is gone</i>

48
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:08,605
and you are here.

49
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,013
Can you just put me back on my meds?
They help.

50
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,816
<i>But you're avoiding the problem.</i>

51
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,752
Look, I want you to try
something.

52
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,756
<i>Sometimes, it helps to talk to
people</i>

53
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:28,091
<i>who have been through similar
situations.</i>

54
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:31,862
<i>And tonight, there's a group</i>
counselling session

55
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:34,798
that I would really like you to
attend.

56
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:48,044
<i>Okay Owen, could you tell your
story please?</i>

57
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:49,513
Um.

58
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:54,418
<i>I know he's in a better place
right now.</i>

59
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,924
Sorry. Sorry.

60
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:04,861
I just wish I could see him

61
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:07,497
<i>for one more time.</i>

62
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,107
Sorry.

63
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,725
<i>I only like the frosting.</i>

64
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:36,726
<i>I've never seen you here
before.</i>

65
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:38,728
Are you new?

66
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>I only come here for the free
food</i>

67
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,670
<i>and because I've got nothing
better to do</i> on Tuesdays.

68
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:53,577
Are you uh, taking anything?

69
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,846
No I'm dry.

70
00:05:56,547 --> 00:06:00,618
Well, tonight I'm feeling
pretty generous.

71
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:03,153
They say we're meant to forget
them.

72
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:05,288
Just like that.

73
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:08,725
But how can we do that if we
haven't had our chance to uh...

74
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:10,228
say our goodbyes?

75
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,501
For later.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,702
Listen closely.

77
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,672
<i>These fuckers don't last long.</i>

78
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:24,307
So make sure you say your
goodbye quickly.

79
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,276
Alright?

80
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:33,050
For later.

81
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:34,951
See you next week!

82
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:43,086
Took you long.

83
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,322
- This place is a bore.
- <i>John?!</i>

84
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,829
- Did you miss me...
- <i>Yes!</i>

85
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:24,228
Hey stranger!

86
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:25,695
<i>I need more.</i>

87
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:27,163
<i>No, no look. I told you</i>

88
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:29,233
<i>to say your goodbyes.</i>

89
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,235
Besides, this shit doesn't grow
on trees.

90
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,903
I have to blow my dealer... semi
regularly.

91
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:35,238
<i>I can pay you</i>

92
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:37,707
Keep it all. I just-

93
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,244
I like you.

94
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,911
Ok, this time

95
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,447
make sure you say your goodbyes,
okay?

96
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:47,418
Cause, this shit can kill you.

97
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:49,954
- Thank you.
- <i>Don't thank me.</i>

98
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,326
Nutter.

99
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,355
We had so many good times in
this bathtub.

100
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:01,125
John.

101
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,127
I can't do this anymore.

102
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,063
But we didn't get to finish last
time.

103
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,937
John, you're dead. You're dead.

104
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:17,007
You died, and the worst thing...

105
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:22,445
We can't do this anymore...
John.

106
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:26,283
Stop, stop, stop...

107
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,153
Why are you being like this!?

108
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,120
I'm here!

109
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,157
You miss me, I miss you.

110
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:36,526
I need to move on John.

111
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,863
Can't do this anymore.

112
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:41,431
<i>No.</i>

113
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:25,108
- No, no, no, no, look at you.
- <i>Please it's the last time.</i>

114
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,410
I need to say goodbye.
I don't have money.

115
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:29,445
You're a mess!

116
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:32,115
What you doing?
FUCK OFF!

117
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:37,047
John?

118
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:39,550
Why are you here?

119
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:42,118
<i>I didn't like the way we left
things.</i>

120
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,488
I need to say goodbye properly.

121
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:46,990
Bye.

122
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:48,993
Don't be like that.

123
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,428
I love you.

124
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,430
I still do.

125
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,567
I've moved on.

126
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,139
What do you mean you've moved
on?

127
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,311
You said you wanted to move on.

128
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:09,279
So I did that.

129
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,470
Don't leave me.

130
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:25,054
Feel better? You should.

131
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:27,223
If you've reached this point
then

132
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:30,226
you've already done the most
important stage.

133
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,361
But admitting your addictions

134
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:35,399
is only the first step on a
journey of

135
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,433
discovery and reinvention.

136
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,569
It's time for Rule Two.

137
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:41,103
Protection.

138
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:43,172
Your ego will try and crush you

139
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:44,807
and drag you back to what feeds
it.

140
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:48,211
Sex. Drugs. Drink.

141
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,480
But you can protect yourself

142
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:52,716
by stopping the destruction

143
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,683
by refusing to give in

144
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:58,187
by beating your ego at
its own game.

145
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:00,657
That's how you protect your
qualities.

146
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:32,623
<i>Trickle.</i>

147
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:34,290
<i>Trickle.</i>

148
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:36,527
<i>Trickle.</i>

149
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:06,355
<i>It all goes away, and it
feels...</i>

150
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:14,764
<i>it feels...</i>

151
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:19,135
so good.

152
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:35,886
<i>We all have to feel pleasure
from somewhere.</i>

153
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:51,467
<i>Scratches and picking</i>

154
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:53,603
<i>clutching at my flesh.</i>

155
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:56,272
<i>Hoping to feel something more.</i>

156
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:37,313
<i>But it just felt the same.</i>

157
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:40,317
<i>Over and over</i>

158
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:42,718
<i>and over again.</i>

159
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,390
<i>Bleed for you.</i>

160
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:47,691
<i>Bleed for me.</i>

161
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,560
<i>It's what I need.</i>

162
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:04,307
<i>At first...</i>

163
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:07,510
<i>I thought I just wanted to feed
on blood.</i>

164
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:19,048
<i>But where's the pain?</i>

165
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:21,351
<i>Where's the pleasure?</i>

166
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:24,288
<i>Hell, I need to be hurt.</i>

167
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,386
<i>Some pretty boys tried to help.</i>

168
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:42,632
<i>Some boys tried, but not hard
enough.</i>

169
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:44,593
<i>Some just didn't get it.</i>

170
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:13,155
<i>Some were just too scared.</i>

171
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:29,806
<i>Disappointing.</i>

172
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:37,213
<i>Joining others in their
festishes</i>

173
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:40,182
<i>certainly was an eyeopener.</i>

174
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:12,715
<i>Couldn't say I was a fan of the
leather.</i>

175
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:48,083
<i>It would be so much easier if I
were its servant.</i>

176
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:51,120
<i>Its prey.</i>

177
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,730
"Bleed For Me" <i>it would cry out.</i>

178
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,768
<i>I would most definitely oblige.</i>

179
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:07,103
<i>Till I reached the ending</i>

180
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:09,105
<i>we both need.</i>

181
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:12,642
<i>A dream.</i>

182
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:14,877
<i>A desire.</i>

183
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:17,646
<i>But just a fantasy.</i>

184
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:23,218
<i>Maybe, if I close my eyes</i>

185
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:25,788
<i>I can keep making it real.</i>

186
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:28,024
<i>Keep it coming for me.</i>

187
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:30,726
<i>My pleasure I need</i>

188
00:24:31,027 --> 00:24:33,596
<i>so badly.</i>

189
00:24:58,086 --> 00:24:59,923
<i>Bleed for me.</i>

190
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:02,424
<i>Bleed for me.</i>

191
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,365
By now, you're probably
thinking...

192
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:11,400
...why should I believe him?

193
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:13,369
Look at his production values.

194
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,372
They look shit.

195
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:19,041
But therein lies the illusion.

196
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:21,911
I chose this place for my video
seminar

197
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,047
for precisely that reason.

198
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,414
It's different.

199
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:28,051
How can you expect to change

200
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,286
if you don't change your
environment?

201
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,355
I've seen far too many of you
losers

202
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:37,126
slip back into your old habits
because you didn't change.

203
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:40,930
You stay locked in your games
room in Mummy's basement

204
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:43,231
and then the addictions return.

205
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:46,036
Because you didn't address Rule
Three.

206
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:47,936
Change Your Environment.

207
00:25:48,202 --> 00:25:50,874
It's time for change. Change is
good.

208
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,477
Get up off your fat ass and get
outside

209
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,481
and for God sake, stop playing
video games.

210
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,220
<i>Good morning Kyle
the Destroyer.</i>

211
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:07,757
<i>You have amassed thirty days of
game play.</i>

212
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,360
<i>Please choose your reward.</i>

213
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,831
<i>Your options are:</i>

214
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,231
<i>Bioweapon attack</i>

215
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:18,000
<i>chickenpox outbreak</i>

216
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,002
<i>or famine.</i>

217
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:23,173
<i>Please choose location.</i>

218
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:28,978
<i>You have selected Stockholm,
Sweden.</i>

219
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:36,219
<i>Congratulations.</i>

220
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,456
<i>Twelve people killed and fifty
injured.</i>

221
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:00,844
Oh, fuck sake.

222
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,193
<i>And now another
chemical attack?</i>

223
00:27:18,227 --> 00:27:21,864
This time in Sweden? SWEDEN?!

224
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:23,865
Come on sheeple, wake up!

225
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:26,401
It's obviously the government,
again.

226
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:29,404
<i>We all know they've been
developing weapons for years.</i>

227
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:33,576
Fluoride in the water, HARP
controlling the weather.

228
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:34,910
What next?!

229
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:38,148
Fake news.

230
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:46,422
Jesus.

231
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:48,423
You gave me a fucking heart
attack.

232
00:27:48,757 --> 00:27:50,625
- What you doing here?
- I was bored

233
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,528
Plus I wanna know the plan for
tonight.

234
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,929
What did you get Abby?

235
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:55,932
Shit.

236
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:57,933
- <i>You forgot?</i>
- Shit!

237
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:00,537
<i>You're not gonna win her back
without a gift man.</i>

238
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:04,107
A pretty fucking special one
after what happened.

239
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:08,845
I'll sort something.

240
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>Kyle the
Destroyer.</i>

241
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:33,501
<i>For one minute only</i>

242
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:36,138
<i>get the acid rain and viral loot
pack</i>

243
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:38,474
for just 11.99.

244
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:04,933
You missed three calls this
morning.

245
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:08,671
- Um, I'm sorry I was...
- <i>No let me guess...</i>

246
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,673
You were playing videogames.

247
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:13,976
You know Kyle, as a virtual
assistant

248
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:17,279
the very definition of that means
you're meant to assist me...

249
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:19,048
...virtually.

250
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,382
Whilst you're on my time

251
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:22,985
then you'll do my tasks,
understood?

252
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:26,989
<i>Welcome back, Kyle
the Destroyer.</i>

253
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:30,225
<i>You have completed fifty in-game
tasks.</i>

254
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:33,897
<i>Please select reward now.</i>

255
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:37,567
<i>Please select location.</i>

256
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:45,340
<i>Congratulations. Ten killed,
113 injured.</i>

257
00:29:51,113 --> 00:29:52,981
<i>You missed the deadline?</i>

258
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,951
I needed this one thing from you

259
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:58,288
and now I get a call saying the
client has pulled out?!

260
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:03,291
Look, I'm really sorry okay I'll
get on it right now.

261
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,193
<i>No. You won't.</i>

262
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:07,129
This is strike three.

263
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:10,399
You will disconnect that laptop
and you will ship it back to me.

264
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,367
<i>You will not be paid for today</i>

265
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:15,104
<i>and your contract is terminated.</i>

266
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:18,674
<i>Wait, no hold on. You can't do
that.</i>

267
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:22,711
You are a temp worker Kyle.

268
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,679
<i>On a zero hour contract.</i>

269
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:27,415
Now I have moved mountains for you

270
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:29,652
but you need to get your shit
together.

271
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:35,124
Just wait, one second...

272
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:36,224
KYLE!?

273
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:38,126
<i>Congratulations.</i>

274
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,263
<i>You've won a bonus
round.</i>

275
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,967
<i>Please choose your
reward.</i>

276
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:47,370
<i>Please select
location.</i>

277
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,075
- Abbie?
- <i>Kyle?</i>

278
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:54,409
<i>Are you coming tonight?</i>

279
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:56,611
- <i>I think we should talk.</i>
- Yeah.

280
00:30:56,644 --> 00:30:58,647
Erm, I want to.

281
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:01,050
It's just, I fucked up.

282
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:03,184
I can't afford to get you a
gift.

283
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:05,621
<i>Just come. I don't care about
that...</i>

284
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:10,593
Okay, erm.

285
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:14,062
So should I say your place at
like six o'clock?...

286
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:17,734
Can you, can you hear that?

287
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:24,173
Look, er, Abbie?

288
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:26,174
I'm gonna have to call you back,
okay...

289
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:28,443
Abbie?!

290
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:47,262
<i>Fourty-nine
assassinations have taken place.</i>

291
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,365
<i>Assassination
fifty...</i>

292
00:31:49,397 --> 00:31:50,499
<i>...pending.</i>

293
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:07,582
By now

294
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:10,286
you might feel as though you're
about to break.

295
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:12,355
But stay with me.

296
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:14,123
Feed off me.

297
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:16,491
Let me be your guide through
this journey.

298
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:19,728
You might feel as though you
can't do this alone

299
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,596
that you need others to help
you.

300
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,366
But how can you be successful

301
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:25,768
if you need others to help you
through?

302
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,801
Take a look at me.

303
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:28,903
Do I look like I rely on others?

304
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:31,073
No.

305
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,109
You're not gonna taint others

306
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:34,576
with your addictions, no no no
no.

307
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,877
You're not gonna use others

308
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:37,846
to fill that void.

309
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:40,582
You're gonna abide by Rule Four.

310
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:42,450
Love your alone time.

311
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:44,853
Fix yourself first.

312
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:04,633
<i>Jason?</i>

313
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:11,739
Hey Jason, it's time to sleep.

314
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:13,608
Dad, I'm watching streams.

315
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:16,077
Okay, don't stay too late.

316
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,712
Okay Dad, I love you.

317
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:18,914
Okay.

318
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:49,111
Hi everyone, my name is Valeria

319
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:50,978
and today I'm gonna show you how
I live.

320
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:53,081
Before I start it, I want

321
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:55,050
to thank everyone following me

322
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,086
and thanks for watching.

323
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:04,726
Jesus said "love thy neighbour"

324
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:06,762
Jesus never tried crack.

325
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,030
If you've made it this far

326
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:10,898
there will now be a void where
your addictions used to hide.

327
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:12,700
Losers rush to fill that void.

328
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,735
Losers find new addictions.

329
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:16,704
the most popular being sex.

330
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:19,140
Nothing takes the edge off like
a top shag.

331
00:40:19,574 --> 00:40:21,143
One things leads to another

332
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:22,944
what starts a bit of fun to calm
down

333
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:24,179
soon turns nasty.

334
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:25,813
Soon, you are knee deep in pussy

335
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,082
whatever pussy you can get.

336
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:29,050
Wive's, girlfriend's, aunt's.

337
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,052
Fun leads to pain leads to
heartbreak

338
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,086
leads to prison.

339
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,822
It's time for Rule Five.

340
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:35,824
Replace your pleasures, and it

341
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,293
is essential.

342
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:49,071
<i>Ready</i>

343
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,375
Woo!

344
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:56,946
<i>Here's one.</i>

345
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:02,750
<i>Hey!</i>

346
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:05,086
<i>Hey you!</i>

347
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,654
Um, hi?

348
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:08,356
<i>She wants to suck your dick</i>

349
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:09,190
What?

350
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,193
<i>For cash.</i>

351
00:41:17,364 --> 00:41:19,767
Becky, are you holding that
again vertically

352
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,804
you savage.

353
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,838
Our viewers want top quality.

354
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:24,940
Turn it around.

355
00:41:53,068 --> 00:41:54,637
Come on, let's go get the cash.

356
00:41:58,206 --> 00:41:58,974
Hey wait!

357
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:06,749
Go go go!

358
00:42:11,385 --> 00:42:12,186
What the fuck!

359
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,423
I didn't even get my... money
yet.

360
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:18,360
Fuck!

361
00:42:29,237 --> 00:42:31,139
Why don't you just do that
later?

362
00:42:33,775 --> 00:42:35,477
Shut up and eat your muffin
Becky.

363
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,389
You're the taxi girls, right?

364
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:51,093
We're the Titty Taxi girls
actually.

365
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,760
We give rides, but...

366
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:55,264
- with a little bit of a difference.
- <i>Oh wait, wait</i>

367
00:42:55,496 --> 00:42:57,132
Let me get that for the intro,
ready?

368
00:43:02,336 --> 00:43:04,905
We are the Titty Taxi girls, and
we give rides

369
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,708
with a little bit of a
difference.

370
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:10,144
I know your videos.

371
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:11,713
I want to fuck you.

372
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:13,215
<i>And I don't even want the cash.</i>

373
00:43:16,818 --> 00:43:18,787
Why would you do that?

374
00:43:19,186 --> 00:43:20,088
<i>My only rule.</i>

375
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:21,889
No filming.

376
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:23,825
No... her.

377
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,728
Oh, charming.

378
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:27,962
No film, no content.

379
00:43:27,996 --> 00:43:29,965
Which means it's absolutely
useless to us.

380
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,737
You've never been fucked by me.

381
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:56,491
Slut.

382
00:44:09,237 --> 00:44:10,539
Bella!?

383
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,908
<i>Bella?</i>

384
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:17,212
Bella what the fuck?!

385
00:44:17,244 --> 00:44:19,248
Go, go, RUN!

386
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:29,258
What the... fuck?

387
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:47,041
Are you okay?

388
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:55,817
Shit. Where's he gone?

389
00:45:00,688 --> 00:45:03,625
No, no, no, no.

390
00:45:16,637 --> 00:45:18,606
I'm sorry. No!

391
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:27,509
Champion bodybuilder, remember?

392
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:30,244
You too can look like... this.

393
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,148
If I can go from skag whore with
blackened teeth

394
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:35,050
to Arnold fucking Schwarzenegger

395
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,152
then, so can you.

396
00:46:37,184 --> 00:46:39,054
All it takes is patience

397
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:41,456
dedication, and following my
rules.

398
00:46:41,688 --> 00:46:43,457
Rule Number Six.

399
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,594
Get. Healthy. Stupid.

400
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,329
How can you expect to be healthy
in mind

401
00:46:48,362 --> 00:46:50,297
if you're not healthy in body,
hmm?

402
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:52,067
Get out, get nutrition

403
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:54,168
and get your fat ass to the gym.

404
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:56,271
Don't be a fucking slob.

405
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:42,416
Shouldn't take that shit home
with you.

406
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:43,718
It's not good for you.

407
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:47,456
Yeah, well I was stuck here
stupidly late last night.

408
00:47:47,822 --> 00:47:49,490
<i>It's called a living mate.</i>

409
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:51,525
Till it kills you.

410
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:27,261
Mate.

411
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:28,829
Do you have to chew so loudly?

412
00:48:30,264 --> 00:48:32,233
Whadaya mean what, look at this
shit, look.

413
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,036
That's the reason why we're sat
here hotdesking.

414
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:36,670
No it's not.

415
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,739
You chose to be here.

416
00:48:38,773 --> 00:48:40,375
- <i>No</i>
- Yeah

417
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:42,411
- No
- <i>Yeah</i>

418
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:49,884
Aww you love me.

419
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:51,752
<i>Want a crisp?</i>

420
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,334
How do you do it?

421
00:49:07,534 --> 00:49:08,135
What?

422
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:11,273
<i>Well look you should be about
fifty fucking stone.</i>

423
00:49:13,273 --> 00:49:15,409
Hmmm, dunno.

424
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:17,412
<i>Doesn't go on.</i>

425
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:19,414
It's like

426
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:22,550
Good metabolism.

427
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,586
<i>Some of us are just...</i>

428
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:27,289
I dunno. Blessed, you know.

429
00:49:27,822 --> 00:49:29,291
Body of adonis.

430
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:32,360
<i>I dunno.</i>

431
00:49:33,728 --> 00:49:35,463
Since I came back from holiday

432
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:37,298
that scuba diving trip, it's
just...

433
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:39,501
...just been hungry

434
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:41,436
<i>Mate, you should go see a
doctor.</i>

435
00:49:43,237 --> 00:49:44,739
Why would I go see a doctor?

436
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:46,540
I can eat what I want

437
00:49:46,706 --> 00:49:47,842
when I want.

438
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:50,277
And I don't have to do any
exercise, so...

439
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:52,813
...winner winner chicken dinner.

440
00:51:36,317 --> 00:51:37,552
Sorry mate.

441
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,489
Fucking hell, what happened to
you?

442
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:44,659
- <i>All that food catch up on you did it?</i>
- Don't, don't start mate.

443
00:51:46,626 --> 00:51:48,496
<i>I woke up today</i>

444
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:50,864
<i>and I looked like this.</i>

445
00:51:52,867 --> 00:51:54,436
I'm taking it easy.

446
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:56,904
<i>Detoxing.</i>

447
00:51:57,704 --> 00:52:00,007
It's all that fat and sugar in
your body.

448
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,043
It's like going cold turkey
isn't it.

449
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:06,780
I feel so sick.

450
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:10,384
So, so sick.

451
00:52:28,568 --> 00:52:30,304
Look mate.

452
00:52:30,338 --> 00:52:32,274
Maybe you should just go home,
yeah?

453
00:52:32,474 --> 00:52:33,708
No.

454
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,677
I'm okay.

455
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:39,413
Alright well I'm not gonna
torture you

456
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,615
I'm off for lunch.

457
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:42,617
Come join me for a drink if you
want.

458
00:53:00,034 --> 00:53:00,902
<i>Josh?</i>

459
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,739
<i>Look, go home mate. Just take a
day or two.</i>

460
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:11,879
Well alright, but I ain't gonna
be here this afternoon.

461
00:53:12,547 --> 00:53:14,481
I don't wanna see you when I get
back.

462
00:53:50,016 --> 00:53:50,818
Josh?

463
00:53:56,724 --> 00:53:57,926
Josh!?

464
00:53:58,259 --> 00:53:59,860
Josh, you alright mate?

465
00:54:00,161 --> 00:54:02,195
Fuckin' hell, stay here...

466
00:54:02,228 --> 00:54:04,365
- I need the, I need the loo.
- You alright? Josh!

467
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,719
I'll just wait here then.

468
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,669
Here, Josh. You alright in
there?

469
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:46,007
Josh?

470
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:05,860
Fuckin' hell Josh.

471
00:55:05,893 --> 00:55:07,661
You needed that didn't ya?

472
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:09,630
Jesus.

473
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:13,935
Oh my days.

474
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,222
Come on mate!

475
00:55:35,322 --> 00:55:36,157
Josh?

476
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:38,592
Josh?

477
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:45,532
Holy shit. Josh!?

478
00:55:45,565 --> 00:55:47,801
Josh? Josh come on!

479
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,222
Shit!

480
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:14,662
Take time for reflection.

481
00:56:15,028 --> 00:56:18,164
Every journey home requires
reflection.

482
00:56:18,197 --> 00:56:20,300
This is a time to look back and
understand

483
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,602
that every addiction is
different.

484
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:24,304
For me, it was sex

485
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:26,207
drugs and drink.

486
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,109
But you might be a freak into
one of the weird ones.

487
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:30,577
If you are

488
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,179
you must be absolutely sure of
yourself.

489
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:34,615
Take time to yourself.

490
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:37,617
Take time to reflect on the
journey so far

491
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,853
and plan for the battle ahead.

492
00:56:40,054 --> 00:56:42,222
And if you are one of those
freaks

493
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:44,692
that addicted to... weird shit

494
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:46,594
like setting fires or food

495
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,263
take time to revisit Steps 1-6

496
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:52,365
in order to be ready.

497
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:03,277
<i>The ancient greeks believed that
life</i>

498
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:05,246
<i>was made from four elements.</i>

499
00:57:06,646 --> 00:57:07,614
<i>Earth</i>

500
00:57:08,148 --> 00:57:09,584
<i>Air</i>

501
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,585
<i>Water</i>

502
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:13,588
<i>and fire.</i>

503
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,295
<i>Those who are born of Earth</i>

504
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:24,298
<i>are nurturing and stable.</i>

505
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:28,335
<i>Air. Soulful and wise.</i>

506
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:31,873
<i>Water. Emotionally pure.</i>

507
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:37,277
<i>But fire?</i>

508
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:39,246
<i>Those who are born of fire</i>

509
00:57:39,278 --> 00:57:41,715
<i>are compelled to consume</i>

510
00:57:41,748 --> 00:57:43,717
<i>and destroy.</i>

511
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:48,155
<i>It is their nature</i>

512
00:57:48,356 --> 00:57:51,159
<i>and nature cannot be overcome.</i>

513
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:03,738
<i>I was born in 1976. The year of
the dragon.</i>

514
00:58:13,746 --> 00:58:15,181
<i>But some say that dragons</i>

515
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:17,151
<i>love to watch the world burn.</i>

516
00:58:17,717 --> 00:58:20,053
<i>But they don't understand.</i>

517
00:58:20,253 --> 00:58:22,690
<i>There's no love in destruction.</i>

518
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:25,425
<i>Just as there is no love in
breathing</i>

519
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,427
<i>or in your heart beating.</i>

520
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,832
<i>It just is, or you fade from
existence.</i>

521
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:19,446
<i>When the leaves of the forest
have fallen</i>

522
00:59:20,246 --> 00:59:22,817
<i>and he says their branches have
twisted</i>

523
00:59:26,452 --> 00:59:28,722
<i>the natural order takes hold</i>

524
00:59:28,755 --> 00:59:30,757
<i>and the organism dies.</i>

525
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:34,295
<i>But its body still remains</i>

526
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:36,297
<i>taking up space.</i>

527
00:59:36,764 --> 00:59:39,099
<i>So the Lord in Heaven sent me</i>

528
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,501
<i>I am the cremator.</i>

529
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,046
<i>Hell is a fossil.</i>

530
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,048
<i>Hell does not rain fire.</i>

531
01:00:28,081 --> 01:00:29,916
<i>For that is our Lord in heaven.</i>

532
01:00:29,949 --> 01:00:33,320
<i>"Then the Lord rained down in
fire and brimstone"</i>

533
01:00:42,563 --> 01:00:45,199
<i>Ever since I was a small child</i>

534
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:47,400
<i>I was drawn to the flame.</i>

535
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:50,871
<i>Even now, decades later</i>

536
01:00:50,903 --> 01:00:54,175
<i>my commitment to my duty has
never wained.</i>

537
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,383
<i>For the red dragon</i>

538
01:01:02,648 --> 01:01:05,353
<i>they rest only upon the ashes of
the wicked.</i>

539
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:10,523
<i>Most wonder if I just live</i>

540
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:12,526
<i>to see the goddamn world burn</i>

541
01:01:12,827 --> 01:01:14,495
<i>or if I love the heat</i>

542
01:01:14,527 --> 01:01:16,096
<i>the smell of hair</i>

543
01:01:16,128 --> 01:01:19,266
<i>the smell of flesh consumed by
flame.</i>

544
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,469
<i>But I already told you</i>

545
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:23,538
<i>I have no love for it.</i>

546
01:01:28,608 --> 01:01:32,179
<i>I simply do what I was ordained
to do.</i>

547
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:35,817
<i>But my time is limited.</i>

548
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,119
<i>For I was given 37 years to
create entropy</i>

549
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:41,155
<i>and chaos.</i>

550
01:01:44,423 --> 01:01:47,427
<i>And now, my candle burns out.</i>

551
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,029
<i>For the water snake is here</i>

552
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:52,066
<i>to snuff me out.</i>

553
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,035
<i>I see it dripping</i>

554
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:57,037
<i>and seeping and creeping</i>

555
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,039
<i>and as fast as I might boil it
away</i>

556
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:00,875
<i>it returns.</i>

557
01:02:01,074 --> 01:02:03,210
<i>The water from the sky</i>

558
01:02:03,242 --> 01:02:05,246
<i>and the water from the Earth</i>

559
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:11,117
<i>"All the fountains of the great
deep"</i>

560
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,254
<i>"burst forth and the floodgates
of the heavens"</i>

561
01:02:14,288 --> 01:02:16,257
<i>"were opened"</i>

562
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:08,541
<i>"and every creature that had
moved upon"</i>

563
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:13,480
<i>"the Earth perished. Burned."</i>

564
01:03:13,512 --> 01:03:21,188
<i>"Livestock. Animals. Every
creature"</i>

565
01:03:21,221 --> 01:03:25,525
<i>"that swarms upon the Earth"</i>

566
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:29,730
<i>"and all mankind".</i>

567
01:03:49,215 --> 01:03:52,552
<i>The red dragon breathes its
final breath.</i>

568
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,532
It's time to face facts.

569
01:04:05,565 --> 01:04:08,302
The medical services are not
your friend.

570
01:04:08,335 --> 01:04:10,670
They don't sell a cure, they
sell a treatment.

571
01:04:10,704 --> 01:04:12,506
There's no money to be made in a
cure

572
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:14,641
it's just another addiction.

573
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:17,311
How do they get you off heroin?
Methadone.

574
01:04:17,344 --> 01:04:19,046
For too long you've been too
weak

575
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:20,014
and too pitiful.

576
01:04:20,047 --> 01:04:21,215
For too long you've been relying

577
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:22,750
on our services to help you.

578
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:26,119
You don't need them

579
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,722
the only system that works is

580
01:04:28,755 --> 01:04:30,791
my ten steps.

581
01:04:30,824 --> 01:04:32,291
Rule Number Eight.

582
01:04:32,324 --> 01:04:33,727
Don't get medicated.

583
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:36,230
Don't believe the hype.

584
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:58,318
Gonna be a bit late back tonight

585
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:00,621
one or two more things to do,
sorry babe.

586
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:07,495
I won't!

587
01:06:19,231 --> 01:06:21,634
You're a creepy little cunt
aren't you?

588
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,708
<i>Your call has been forwarded to
an</i>

589
01:06:28,742 --> 01:06:30,744
<i>automatic voice message system.</i>

590
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:32,278
<i>Hi, you've reached Mary</i>

591
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:33,847
<i>please leave a message.</i>

592
01:06:35,581 --> 01:06:37,416
Hey babe, just want you to know
that

593
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:38,818
I love you

594
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:40,420
and that I won't be too much
longer

595
01:06:40,452 --> 01:06:41,721
just got literally like

596
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:43,789
three more things to do.

597
01:06:43,822 --> 01:06:45,759
Then I'm coming home.

598
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:18,851
Oh, things are really moving
along now.

599
01:08:18,885 --> 01:08:20,354
Yes indeed they are.

600
01:08:20,386 --> 01:08:22,521
You can feel it can't you, the
electricity

601
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:23,757
the excitement!

602
01:08:23,789 --> 01:08:25,458
You're on a verge of a
breakthrough

603
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:27,527
and you can't afford to stop
now, no no.

604
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,429
Don't you fall for it, don't you
stop.

605
01:08:29,462 --> 01:08:30,397
Rule Number Nine is

606
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:31,498
Don't give in.

607
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,332
You've got to be prepared to
stare death in the face

608
01:08:33,365 --> 01:08:34,400
Just like I did.

609
01:08:34,434 --> 01:08:35,702
And there, and only there

610
01:08:35,734 --> 01:08:38,238
Will you truly know yourself.

611
01:08:39,872 --> 01:08:42,475
I stared death in the face...

612
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:45,012
and I decked the cunt.

613
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:24,718
Hello?

614
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:26,753
<i>It's Janet</i>

615
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:28,922
Janet... Yeah.

616
01:09:30,023 --> 01:09:31,525
I thought we were meeting up

617
01:09:31,824 --> 01:09:32,992
- In person
- <i>Nah</i>

618
01:09:33,025 --> 01:09:34,493
<i>There's police everywhere</i>

619
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:35,729
<i>I ain't risking it.</i>

620
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:37,398
<i>Look in the envelope.</i>

621
01:09:45,671 --> 01:09:48,507
<i>This girl I've got for you...
she's fresh.</i>

622
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:50,878
<i>Escaped some medical trial a few
days ago.</i>

623
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:52,813
Normal rate?

624
01:09:52,845 --> 01:09:54,480
<i>No, no.</i>

625
01:09:54,514 --> 01:09:56,083
<i>She's a rare find.</i>

626
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:58,051
<i>It's gonna cost you Jonny boy.</i>

627
01:09:58,585 --> 01:09:59,920
Well...

628
01:09:59,953 --> 01:10:03,624
You did really get me a fucked
up one this time.

629
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:06,093
What happened to her face?

630
01:10:25,177 --> 01:10:25,912
<i>Delivery.</i>

631
01:10:37,923 --> 01:10:39,560
Can I get you a water?

632
01:10:51,637 --> 01:10:52,439
<i>So...</i>

633
01:10:53,206 --> 01:10:54,742
Tell me about yourself.

634
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,977
<i>Your life and that...</i>

635
01:11:13,059 --> 01:11:14,728
<i>Quick come on!</i>

636
01:11:16,128 --> 01:11:17,597
Ray!

637
01:11:49,194 --> 01:11:50,096
Uh...

638
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:53,033
<i>I'm paying by the hour here...</i>

639
01:11:53,966 --> 01:11:55,034
So...

640
01:11:55,234 --> 01:11:57,804
the least you could do

641
01:12:00,305 --> 01:12:03,476
is try not to be a little cunt.

642
01:12:15,688 --> 01:12:16,890
Write down

643
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:18,625
three things

644
01:12:19,057 --> 01:12:20,894
that you want me to do to you.

645
01:12:23,296 --> 01:12:24,865
I need to drain the beast

646
01:12:25,998 --> 01:12:27,067
be right back.

647
01:12:39,912 --> 01:12:41,047
<i>Hello?</i>

648
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:43,484
<i>Hello?</i>

649
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:45,586
<i>I think you've got the wrong
number.</i>

650
01:12:46,219 --> 01:12:47,554
<i>Who is this?</i>

651
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:49,856
<i>Ray, is that... you?</i>

652
01:12:50,355 --> 01:12:50,889
<i>Ray?</i>

653
01:12:51,423 --> 01:12:53,025
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

654
01:12:53,059 --> 01:12:55,996
<i>Tell me where you are and I'll
come get you.</i>

655
01:13:20,353 --> 01:13:21,889
Your mouth

656
01:13:22,122 --> 01:13:24,758
isn't gonna be the only gaping
hole

657
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,293
when I'm done with you.

658
01:14:15,942 --> 01:14:16,909
<i>Ray?</i>

659
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:19,179
Oh my God.

660
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:24,650
<i>Look at you though! Look.</i>

661
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:31,658
Get off!

662
01:14:35,828 --> 01:14:37,697
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

663
01:14:37,729 --> 01:14:38,664
Come on!

664
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:47,841
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

665
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:50,310
Okay, come on.

666
01:14:58,751 --> 01:14:59,418
<i>You know</i>

667
01:14:59,685 --> 01:15:01,388
<i>I don't always get things right.</i>

668
01:15:07,426 --> 01:15:09,996
<i>And I've done lots of terrible
things.</i>

669
01:15:11,163 --> 01:15:13,132
Truly terrible things.

670
01:15:14,266 --> 01:15:16,636
But I'd like to make amends.

671
01:15:16,837 --> 01:15:17,671
<i>So...</i>

672
01:15:17,703 --> 01:15:19,872
<i>I've given you a brand new
look.</i>

673
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:23,377
You're gonna be so popular.

674
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:26,912
<i>And I've removed all
distractions.</i>

675
01:15:36,756 --> 01:15:39,292
<i>Don't use all your energy up
just yet.</i>

676
01:15:39,557 --> 01:15:41,795
I've just got a call from a
particularly

677
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,963
horny old man who's right in the
market

678
01:15:43,996 --> 01:15:45,465
for an amputee...

679
01:15:57,342 --> 01:15:58,377
It's everywhere

680
01:15:58,411 --> 01:16:00,512
temptation... addiction...

681
01:16:00,546 --> 01:16:02,148
it takes only the smallest split

682
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,116
to fall back in the cage that
you crawled out of.

683
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,286
You will need to avoid your
weaknesses

684
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:07,520
for the rest of your life.

685
01:16:07,552 --> 01:16:09,288
It will be hard but, you can do
it

686
01:16:09,322 --> 01:16:11,356
I know you can because, I have

687
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:14,427
Follow me, check the list. You
flourish.

688
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,128
It's okay to fail once or twice

689
01:16:16,162 --> 01:16:17,896
cause you know what? Even the
strongest do.

690
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:19,532
They go back, they get weirder

691
01:16:19,564 --> 01:16:21,835
their risky behaviours become
more intense

692
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:23,770
to satisfy their urges.

693
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,771
Do not become one of them, hmm?

694
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:27,774
Rule Number Ten

695
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,510
Stay sober.

696
01:16:32,511 --> 01:16:34,380
<i>Stay sober.</i>

697
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:36,482
Stay!

698
01:16:36,515 --> 01:16:38,417
Sober!

699
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:45,958
Oh yes.

700
01:16:51,329 --> 01:16:52,399
Oh yes.

701
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:01,875
Hi hun.

702
01:17:02,809 --> 01:17:05,112
Yes it's... all done.

703
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:07,313
No, I...

704
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,115
can't come straight home I've

705
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:11,484
got an appointment I must get to

706
01:17:11,516 --> 01:17:13,519
you know how it is.

707
01:17:14,186 --> 01:17:15,421
I am the world's

708
01:17:15,822 --> 01:17:17,824
foremost expert.

709
01:17:19,391 --> 01:17:22,295
I'll be in time to put them to
bed

710
01:17:22,528 --> 01:17:23,864
I promise.

711
01:17:25,096 --> 01:17:27,266
When have I lied to you babe?

712
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:29,569
Don't worry yourself about it.

713
01:17:30,936 --> 01:17:32,905
Just make sure everything's
ready for when

714
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,975
I... get... in

715
01:17:36,274 --> 01:17:37,277
Okay.

716
01:17:38,277 --> 01:17:39,880
Bye, love you too.

717
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,015
Okay, mwah.

718
01:17:42,047 --> 01:17:43,916
Bye, bye buh buh-

719
01:17:58,530 --> 01:17:59,599
Jesus...

720
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,902
wept, fuck!

721
01:18:03,903 --> 01:18:04,905
Yes!

722
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,238
That's a good...

723
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:09,074
Is that running?

724
01:18:09,108 --> 01:18:10,944
Turn that off, turn it off!
