00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:53,444
THE GREEN ROOM

2
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:14,097
The history of the green room

3
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:16,385
unfolds in
a small city in the East of France.

4
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,393
It starts 10 years after
the end of the 1st World War

5
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:21,310
which caused millions of deaths.

6
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,228
Good morning lady,
I come to see Mr. Mazet

7
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:34,055
- Gerard Mazet
- Come in, sir. Follow me, please.

8
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,771
- Gerard
- No, Julien, don't go and see her.

9
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,566
I prefer you keep
the memory of Genevieve,

10
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,896
of when she was alive,
of when she smiled.

11
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,630
I want to be with you, Gerard.

12
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:03,635
No, no, I don't want that!

13
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:08,206
Stop that! Get out of here!

14
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,645
Genevieve, Genevieve!

15
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:17,838


16
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,123
Death is only a transitory
state, my son, for the baptized.

17
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,729
Sin entered the world
through the first man, Adam,

18
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,634
and with sin, death.

19
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,101
With his death,
Jesus saved us from sin,

20
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,263
and so, saved us from death
which is the daughter of sin.

21
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,364
His wife is not dead,
my son, because she was baptized,

22
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,015
washed of original sin.

23
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,249
She has not died, she's only sleeping,

24
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,448
incorruptible.

25
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:48,211
And she'll be like that
until the end of times.

26
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,487
Until the day she wakes up and you

27
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,959
wake up with her to appear

28
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:55,385
in front of our Father and our Judge.

29
00:04:55,606 --> 00:05:00,409
In the meanwhile,
pray my son. Pray and wait.

30
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:03,160
Purify yourself,
to be worthy of reuniting with her

31
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:07,064
on the day of Resurrection
and the Glory of the Lord.

32
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,759
Reunite with her on Resurrection day.

33
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:12,358
But when will
that day arrive? When, when?

34
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:16,217
Patience, my son.
Patience and hope.

35
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,110
No! It's not possible that she died!

36
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:30,315
Genevieve!

37
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:36,379
Leave me. All of you!

38
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,581
- Gerard, don't do that!
- I want to die!

39
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:39,730
Take care of him.

40
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:43,346
It's your fault,
Mr. priest. Yes, your fault.

41
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:45,164
This woman did not die because of sin,

42
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,200
she died of pneumonia.

43
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:48,388
Your words of resignation
are of no use to her husband.

44
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:50,448
Those who weep
for their dead, it's not in 20 years,

45
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,645
nor in a thousand that they hope
to see them again, but right now.

46
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,289
All that they expect
from you is that you say:

47
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:57,482
get up and walk!
And that the dead get up.

48
00:05:57,517 --> 00:06:00,049
And if you are
incapable of resurrecting Genevieve

49
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:03,227
today, right now,
there's nothing for you to do here.

50
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,835
So get out. Out!

51
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:24,836
I promised myself
to be strong. I wanted to resist.

52
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,703
And Mazet will resist...

53
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,733
only if he doesn't have to
listen to conventional consolations.

54
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:37,739
Yes, I know what you are feeling.

55
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,668
You'd have liked to be dead in her
place, or at the same time as her,

56
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:46,028
but it depends only on you
that Genevieve stays alive.

57
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:48,629
How can you say that? How do you know?

58
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,933
Your story is exactly like mine, Mazet.

59
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,413
My wife died 11 years ago,

60
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:53,858
a few months after our marriage,

61
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,441
on a trip to Italy.

62
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,905
Like you,
I thought that I couldn't live.

63
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,146
Around me I heard
only stupid words of resignation.

64
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,697
Like you, I wanted to die.

65
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:06,935
And how did you find
the courage to continue without her?

66
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:09,038
I decided that
even if she had died for the others,

67
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:10,928
for me she will always be alive.

68
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,968
Listen Mazet,
I'll tell you something important.

69
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,137
For those who don't care,

70
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,089
Genevieve's eyes are closed.

71
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,157
But for you they will always be open.

72
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:35,246
Don't think you've lost her.

73
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,300
Think that now
you can't lose her any more.

74
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,822
Dedicate all your thoughts to her,

75
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:42,360
all your activities, all your love,

76
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:44,701
and you'll see
that the dead belong to us,

77
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,801
if we accept to belong to them.

78
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:48,529
Believe me, Gerard,

79
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,343
our dead can go on living.

80
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,334
Are you looking for something, sir?

81
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:45,827
Yes, Iâ€™d like to know

82
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,885
whether in the auction
of the day after tomorrow,

83
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,785
in the belongings
of the Vallance family,

84
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,148
there are any antique jewels.

85
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:55,500
I don't know,
the secretary can inform you.

86
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,932
Good morning, sir.

87
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,795
I think I understood
you are looking for some object.

88
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,615
Yes, I'm looking for an old ring
that belonged to the Vallance family.

89
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,833
Almost all things in here
belong to the Vallance family.

90
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:09,730
Could you describe me that ring?

91
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:13,205
It's a silver ring,
shaped like an eight,

92
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,520
with two amethysts inside of the curl.

93
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:20,663
It's not here because the jewels
will be auctioned another day.

94
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:24,522
But if I see that ring
I'll put it aside for one day,

95
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:27,978
so that you can
identify it before the auction.

96
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,905
- Thank you very much.
- No problem at all.

97
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,168
I've never seen you here.
You're not an auction regular?

98
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:37,395
No. To tell the truth,
I don't like them at all.

99
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,888
Especially if I knew
the owners of the objects on sale.

100
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:43,757
I feel like
being at some kind of pillage.

101
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,313
For instance,
this clock and these adornments,

102
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:50,196
who can guarantee us
that they will not be dispersed

103
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:52,581
If I could I wouldn't
be opposed to this kind of thing.

104
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:55,419
I understand, but
that wouldn't resurrect the dead.

105
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,503
- Do you really believe that?
- I don't know.

106
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:00,003
You can call it
professional deformation,

107
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,084
but I only like old objects

108
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,898
that have belonged to somebody.

109
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:07,100
I detest new objects,
that's why I'm working here.

110
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,458
Where can I find you if I find the ring?

111
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,622
At the Globe newspaper, I work there.

112
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,365
- The Globe still exists?
- Yes.

113
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,354
I thought that that paper
had disappeared some time ago.

114
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,016
I used to glance through
the collections in my uncle's attic.

115
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:23,464
OK, thank you.

116
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,123
Wait until I find your ring.

117
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:29,431
I know what you're thinking.

118
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:33,881
That you've seen this somewhere.
They're Napolitan marionettes.

119
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,318
They're very pretty.
Alright, thank you miss.

120
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:37,847
Good afternoon, sir.

121
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:05,214
It's him, go open the door.

122
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:12,265
Hello, Georges.

123
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,393
Sir, the boy has
repaired the projector,

124
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:28,209
but you'd better inspect it.

125
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:29,865
You are right, Mrs. Rambaud.

126
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,206
Come here Georges.

127
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,002
OK.

128
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:49,796
You've repaired it very well.
Here, take these plates.

129
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:02,428
OK Georges, turn it on.

130
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:11,103
Let's see the first plate.

131
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,046
You know the dragonfly, don't you?

132
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,652
Put another plate.

133
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,358
Yes, you're right,
it's the other way around.

134
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,081
Careful with your fingers.

135
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:36,391
Flees, big flees. They're well drawn.

136
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:38,145
Do you like it?

137
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,178
No, insects don't interest you. Wait.

138
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,108
Wait.

139
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,352
I just bought them.

140
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,887
Look, theyâ€™re very nice. You'll see.

141
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,808
They are wounded soldiers,
perhaps they are dead.

142
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,609
Yes, in the sand,
they fell to the ground.

143
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:18,770
Put this other one.

144
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:29,110
The church was bombed.

145
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,023
Yes, they brought the wounded
to the church to protect them.

146
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,704
And this one, a howitzer
probably cut off his head.

147
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,878
Look, Georges,
it's a dead soldier hanging in a tree.

148
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:04,429
He's hanging because of an explosion.

149
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:08,119
Don't you have anything else
to show him than these horrors?

150
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:09,670
They are not for his age.

151
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:12,312
You're right,
Mrs. Rimbaud. Let's have supper.

152
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,561
Really, I don't understand your denial.

153
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,662
I'm offering you a unique opportunity.

154
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,163
What's more,
you'd work in Paris with me.

155
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:34,299
I don't like Paris, I'm a provincial.

156
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:37,825
But you wouldn't like
to work for a real paper?

157
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,202
A weekly, at the heart of events.

158
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:45,837
I feel flattered that you thought of me.

159
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:49,753
But I like the Globe,
so that if you have to sell it,

160
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,997
sell me with it,
with the files and the furniture.

161
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:55,186
But what if nobody would buy The Globe.

162
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:58,293
Come here, I'll show you something.

163
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:11,509
These are the issues that are
returned in the mail every month.

164
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,311
Read it yourself. Subscriber deceased.

165
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:20,119
Return to sender.
Subscriber deceased... deceased.

166
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:24,983
It shouldn't be
for me to tell you, you are young.

167
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:28,228
All our subscribers are old.

168
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:31,272
Each of these issues
represents a dead reader.

169
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,089
Yes, I didn't know
how to explain to you before

170
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:35,827
the reasons why
I don't want to go to Paris.

171
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:37,365
You just gave them to me yourself.

172
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,640
I want to stay here, for them.

173
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:52,989
- Miss.
- Good afternoon.

174
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,892
I think we found
the ring you were looking for.

175
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,329
- Ah, great!
- I'll be with you in a minute.

176
00:15:58,364 --> 00:15:59,407
OK, thanks a lot.

177
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:04,626
- Miss, can I go?
- Sure, Gustav.

178
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:09,488
- See you, Ms. Mandel
- Bye bye, Gustav.

179
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:11,411
- Your name is Mandel?
- Yes.

180
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:13,191
Can I ask you your first name?

181
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,835
Cecilia.

182
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,035
But it's much easier
if you remember my parents.

183
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,182
Wasn't your father's name Julien?

184
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,805
Yes, he died quite a while ago,

185
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:27,393
but his name was Julien, like yours.

186
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:31,096
So, why didn't you
tell me the other day

187
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,767
that we've seen each other before.

188
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,720
I didn't want to bother you.

189
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,150
And also it's very logical
that you don't remember me.

190
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:43,832
I have good memories of our meeting.

191
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:46,513
I was a teenager, shy with people.

192
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,180
Really, everything made me afraid.

193
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,798
But you talked to me as to an adult,

194
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,857
without irony.

195
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,914
Now I remember that meeting.

196
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,936
It'll be about 11 years ago, in Rome.

197
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:02,577
There was a big storm and
we sought shelter with your father

198
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:05,873
and his friends in a ditch
opened by archaeologists.

199
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,777
It was at Caesar's palace.
You see, everything's engraved.

200
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,036
Not at all.

201
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:13,261
It wasn't in Rome, but in Naples.

202
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:16,709
I wasn't 11 years ago, but 14.

203
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,223
It's true there was
a storm, but that was in Pompeii.

204
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:23,280
And it wasn't my father,
I was with my father's brother.

205
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:26,688
- My uncle Henry.
- I mixed it all up.

206
00:17:26,723 --> 00:17:29,392
So many things have happened since then.

207
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:32,469
There's been a war,
bad and cruel things.

208
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,813
But two years after our meeting,

209
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,502
I was convinced that I'd see again

210
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,631
the man who had talked
to me like to an adult.

211
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:42,536
And I had a profound
reason for thinking that.

212
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:51,835
You're impatient to see your ring
and I will give it to you.

213
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,331
Yes, excuse me.

214
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:56,013
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

215
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:58,593
It will have to
follow the due course of the auction.

216
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:00,860
It will have
a starting price of 100 francs.

217
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:03,734
You can tell me
how high you are willing to bid.

218
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:05,776
I thought to go until 300 francs.

219
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,162
Do you think that will be sufficient?

220
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:09,601
Yes, it's very nice but
I don't think they will bid much higher.

221
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,153
I promise nothing, but I'll look
for you during the auction.

222
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:17,277
I prefer not to be
at the auction, it's painful for me.

223
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,731
I understand. So tell
the person who represents you

224
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,923
to make himself known
before the auction.

225
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,080
Mrs. Rambaud will come, my housekeeper.

226
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,244
Very well.

227
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,935
- Could I see the ring again?
- Of course.

228
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,377
- Yes sir?

229
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,170
I'm going to dictate some letters.

230
00:18:55,505 --> 00:19:02,262
Tell me, what do they
think of Davenne here?

231
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:05,279
What did you mean, sir?
What do you want to know?

232
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:07,945
Ah, at ease. I'm not
asking anything indiscreet.

233
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,956
I only asked you

234
00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:12,910
what the colleagues think of Davenne.

235
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:16,179
Mr. Davenne is a bit special.

236
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:18,665
He talks little and
nobody sees him in town.

237
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,962
They think that he
must have suffered a lot,

238
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:23,150
with the loss of
so many friends in the war,

239
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:24,928
while he himself was not even wounded.

240
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,508
I think he was in an
anti-aircraft unit, but in artillery.

241
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,930
Yes. They were
very close to the front.

242
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:32,057
They didn't kill many enemies,

243
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:36,047
but the Germans feared them
and couldn't localize them.

244
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:38,743
That's why no one of them was wounded.

245
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,482
Do you believe Davenne
blames himself because of that?

246
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:44,943
It's possible.

247
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:48,397
There are few men here
of Davenne's generation...

248
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:50,529
who still have both of their legs.

249
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,241
Anyway, he's a strange one!

250
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,046
My impression is that he voluntarily

251
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:59,389
decided to eschew
all the good things of life.

252
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,416
Some people don't like him.

253
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,409
They find him distant.

254
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:05,010
I think that he never recovered...

255
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:06,438
from the death of his wife.

256
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,369
They got engaged just before the war.

257
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:11,608
She waited 4 years for him,
and then the were newly wedded,

258
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,481
when it happened, when she died.

259
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,654
After that he was not the same any more.

260
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:18,072
But I think Mr. Davenne isn't a bad guy.

261
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:20,194
When I say he fails
in all that he embarks on,

262
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:24,497
I'm unjust, because he's
a virtuoso in the obituary columns.

263
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:26,805
When I think that in the past year

264
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:29,078
he wrote 31 articles about dead persons,

265
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:32,076
without ever using
the same expression twice.

266
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:48,630
I'm looking at you!

267
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:57,727
You still here?

268
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:02,463
Go on, go.

269
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:06,628
We start at 10 francs. 10, 20, 30...

270
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:10,302
40, 50, 60 on the left.

271
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:13,598
70, 80 on the back, 90 on the left.

272
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,609
We are at 90.

273
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,585
90 once, twice, 90 thrice.

274
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,141
Awarded for 90 francs
to the lady on the left.

275
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:25,372
OK, now we go on to the jewels.

276
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:30,672
We're auctioning this ring,
mounted with two amethysts.

277
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:35,814
The mount is silver,
and the stones are amethysts.

278
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,869
We start at 100 francs.

279
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:42,036
110 bid by the lady in the
black tulle at the back on the left.

280
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:45,206
120, 130, 130 on the left.

281
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,331
Nobody bids higher? 140, 150, 160...

282
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:54,350
180, 185, 190, a bid of 200
at the back on the right.

283
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:57,573
210, nobody more? 220.

284
00:21:57,574 --> 00:22:00,762
230, once, twice, thrice.

285
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:04,111
Awarded for 230 francs
to the lady with the tulle.

286
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:09,506
Thank you, thank you very much.

287
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,700
Listen, Mrs. Rambaud,
I'm not in, for nobody.

288
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:32,946
Yes? Ah, Mr. Davenne
is not in, he's on a trip.

289
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:10,855
I found your ring, Julie.

290
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,824
I wanted to give it to you today,
without waiting for your birthday.

291
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,001
I've not forgotten you, Julie. I don't
forget you, in spite of the years.

292
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:57,407
On the contrary,
I think about you more and more.

293
00:23:57,842 --> 00:24:00,910
This night that's starting,
we'll pass it together.

294
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:13,239
Alright, it's a
bother but we can't wait longer.

295
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:17,438
OK, I'll tell your friend Davenne
that you came to see him.

296
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:20,803
No, don't tell him,
I'd like it to be a surprise.

297
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:24,819
Understand it, he helped me
so much when my first wife died.

298
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:27,303
I thought he'd like it
if I present him Yvonne.

299
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:30,423
- Ah, it's you!
- Yes, I'm Yvonne Mazet,

300
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,289
we married last month in Paris.

301
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,260
My compliments to you both.

302
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:36,674
I went to spend some time
in the house of my cousin,

303
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:37,752
to have a change of air.

304
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:39,763
We met at the station,

305
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,740
and on arriving
at your house I got the wrong floor.

306
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:44,110
I rang the door
and it was Yvonne who opened it.

307
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:46,028
I was very lucky.

308
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,603
No, it's me, Gerard, who was lucky.

309
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:51,465
You know, this horrible war
has killed so many men,

310
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,368
that it condemned many women

311
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:54,553
to stay single.

312
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:57,414
I feel very happy that we met.

313
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,618
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

314
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:05,880
You can see the happiness in your face.
I was a pleasure to see you.

315
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,915
And, of course I'll keep the secret.

316
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,366
His wife died a few months ago
and he already replaced her.

317
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:23,392
Genevieve Mazet was blond like wheat,

318
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,385
the new Mrs. Mazet is brown like ebony.

319
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:28,018
I imagine that for him
it was just a change of hair color.

320
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:29,790
And he even had the gall
to present her to me,

321
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,909
thinking I'd like it.

322
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,252
Why keep that men from loving?

323
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,433
Why stop him rebuilding his life?

324
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:37,945
You think people can't love again?

325
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,083
- I don't know.
- You really don't know?

326
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,652
I can only tell you
that when his wife died,

327
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:46,403
the true one, not the impostress,

328
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:48,986
Mazet was in a state of
absolute despair.

329
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:51,130
If you'd seen his face, crying,

330
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,148
he even tried to commit suicide.

331
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:57,596
I stayed with him,
talked abd tried to help him.

332
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:59,898
And that woman
who dedicated her life to him,

333
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,165
he replaced as if she was a servant.

334
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,697
I can't agree with your indignation.

335
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:06,610
Why would a second Mazet

336
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:08,488
erase the memory of the dead one?

337
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:10,262
Who tells you this marriage

338
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:12,002
isn't another way of remembering?

339
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:14,215
Almost all my friends died in the war.

340
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,000
You think
other friends have replaced them?

341
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:20,913
How could the dead remain

342
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,536
if they aren't in the memory
of those who live?

343
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:26,888
A short while ago
I went back to St. Germain,

344
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:29,185
where I spent 2 years of the war.

345
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,627
The combat was so violent there,

346
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,775
that the soil is full of shells,

347
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:35,888
and the earth itself
has become arid.

348
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,217
So that
in this cruel world without pity

349
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,512
I want to have the right not to forget.

350
00:28:40,547 --> 00:28:42,753
Even if I have to be
the only one who doesn't forget.

351
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:48,425
I can't find words as easily as you.

352
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,992
But I firmly believe
that it's necessary to forget.

353
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,537
Excuse me, I've been stupid.

354
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:05,986
It's my fault,
I've spoken brutally to you.

355
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:12,998
- It's true, you're too brutal.
- Probably because of my solitude.

356
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:15,160
It's very rare I have
the opportunity to talk with somebody

357
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:17,288
in private, like we're doing right now.

358
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:21,205
So I imagine that
I've simply lost the habit of listening.

359
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:29,783
I told you before
I had a reason for remembering you.

360
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:34,491
You didn't ask me to tell you,
can I tell you now?

361
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:36,084
I'm listening to you.

362
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,272
I thought we were alike...

363
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:41,548
because we have some
important things in common.

364
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,810
For years,
when people talked about you to me,

365
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:48,301
they said you were the man whose wife

366
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,779
appeared to him
at the moment of her death,

367
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,919
even though
being thousands of miles apart.

368
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:55,207
That's right,
that's what happened to me.

369
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,842
But at times I'm sorry
that I've talked about it.

370
00:29:57,877 --> 00:29:59,646
I should have kept it a secret.

371
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:02,740
I understand.

372
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,452
At that time it was almost a fable.

373
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,441
I think the others have forgotten it,

374
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:10,099
but I remember it often,

375
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:12,464
because later the same thing
happened to me with my father...

376
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:15,279
almost the same.

377
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,059
Well, it's very long ago.

378
00:30:18,794 --> 00:30:21,100
No, I'd like you to tell it to me.

379
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:23,380
Wait, I'll stop the car.

380
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:28,565
I'm listening to you.

381
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:32,244
My mother had died 5 years before,

382
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,930
and my father had
sent me to a boarding school.

383
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,542
I only saw him at holidays.

384
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,671
One day,
9 years ago, the 17th of March,

385
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:43,900
on a school visit
to the Louvre museum,

386
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:47,669
I stayed alone in front of a painting

387
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,141
in a small exposition room.

388
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:51,393
There were only two persons present.

389
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:55,485
A guard, and a visitor,
whom I thought at first was a tourist.

390
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,811
I only noticed that he wore no hat

391
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:00,703
and that he sat on a sofa.

392
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:04,571
At the very moment
that I looked at him again,

393
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:07,289
I recognized my father.

394
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:10,215
He looked at me,

395
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:15,925
he smiled at me
and he held out his arms to me.

396
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,501
So I ran towards him, very happy

397
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:20,700
opening my arms too.

398
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:23,637
But he disappeared.

399
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:26,110
That same evening
I received a telegram

400
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:28,548
announcing his death.

401
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:30,400
It had happened at the very time

402
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:32,417
he appeared to me in the museum.

403
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:37,393
You know, somehow
that vision made my sorrow lighter.

404
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:44,068
And the image of him
I've kept is of that apparition.

405
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,354
The story they told me
about you and the death of your wife

406
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,858
made a big impression on me.

407
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:54,704
And later, always when thinking
about the death of my father,

408
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,954
my thoughts led me to you.

409
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,708
Yes, we've had the same experience.

410
00:32:00,743 --> 00:32:03,711
That's why we love the dead,
we don't want them to be forgotten.

411
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:06,593
We can't accept
that they're betrayed, we are similar.

412
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:09,122
No, we are not similar.

413
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:11,636
True, I love the dead, I respect them,

414
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:13,966
but I love the living just as well.

415
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:17,340
Listen, somebody dies,
a child comes into the world,

416
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,070
new friends can
replace those who disappeared.

417
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,921
It's the natural flow of life.

418
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:24,929
A man adores his wife and
suffers the misfortune of losing her.

419
00:32:24,964 --> 00:32:27,802
Well, I think
it's normal that he loves again.

420
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,646
It's natural.

421
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:35,187
No, if you want to talk
about Mazet you will not convince me.

422
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:38,777
I think Mazet's
conduct has been unspeakable.

423
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:40,568
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

424
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:42,324
I thought we had the same ideas.

425
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,254
I thought so too.

426
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:47,160
We don't have
the same way of loving the dead.

427
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,558
You love the dead against the living.

428
00:32:50,193 --> 00:32:52,420
I can go home now.

429
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,926
I prefer to say goodbye here.
Don't accompany me.

430
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,268
As you wish.

431
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:51,884
One moment, hang on.

432
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,966
Mr. Bishop?

433
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:04,014


434
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,315
When will it take place.

435
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:19,878
I have work for you.

436
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,773
Massigny has died.

437
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:23,188
What! Has he died?

438
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:25,793
Yes, in an accident.
In a most stupid way.

439
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:28,897
He stopped on the highway
so that his companion could get out...

440
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:33,377
and on opening the door,
a truck knocked him over.

441
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:35,201
So Massigny is dead.

442
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:37,064
Yes, they brought his body to town.

443
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,960
The burial
will be the day after tomorrow.

444
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,581
The hotels are full.
Many people arrived from Paris.

445
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:43,955
Politicians, reporters,
and not only men...

446
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,720
Massigny liked women.

447
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:50,189
Monique will give you
the documentation about him.

448
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:53,049
I don't need
documentation to write about him.

449
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:23,467
I just finished
the article on Massigny...

450
00:35:23,502 --> 00:35:26,147
but I didn't have
the courage to read it again.

451
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,404
Mr. Davenne... the Massigny file.

452
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:44,023
And what do you want me to do with it?

453
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,494
Mr. Bishop wants you
to pick a photo for the article.

454
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:50,486
This is Massigny
on an official trip to Russia.

455
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:53,261
A yes, that was in '23.

456
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:56,790
Here,
at the tomb of the unknown soldier.

457
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:02,493
Massigny
at the moment of the Tunis crisis.

458
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:05,391
I didn't know this photo.

459
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:10,072
And this is the
famous photo of the missing minister.

460
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:15,206
And here, just a portrait.
This one's already been published.

461
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:17,626
And this other one doesn't look good.

462
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:22,397
Listen, I don't want
to choose myself. You do it.

463
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,809
- OK, good afternoon Monique.
- Good afternoon sir.

464
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:39,577
Davenne, wait!

465
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,612
But, what has got into you?

466
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:45,048
You're not expecting
that we publish this?

467
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:47,628
What's wrong with it?
Is it too short, or what?

468
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,145
Did you realize
in what way you talk about him?

469
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,675
It looks like
you'd want him to die a second time.

470
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,965
Give me the article.
Ask somebody else to write it.

471
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,688
But...
I thought you two were very close.

472
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:58,849
I don't understand.

473
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,875
That's why I suggest that the article

474
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,907
be written by someone
who didn't know Massigny.

475
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:06,880
He was my best friend, and since
the day he stopped being that,

476
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:08,312
nobody has replaced him.

477
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,906
He taught me a very difficult lesson.

478
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:13,512
When you accept
that you belong to society,

479
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:16,468
you have to protect
yourself from disgust.

480
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:19,285
The truth is that you hated him?

481
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,936
No, hate is no part
in my way of looking at life.

482
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:24,784
But true, when
I think of him, I think of the man

483
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:26,995
who has done me
more damage than anybody.

484
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,142
Through him, I saw that for some

485
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:32,115
life is a ferocious competition
in which everything is permitted.

486
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,485
That's why I got out
of the race, and thanks to Massigny

487
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,669
I became a spectator of life.

488
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:42,022
You are right, he was my friend,
and the only thing I feel,

489
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:46,035
learning of his death,
is an immense relief.

490
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:00,921
Which advantages
would Massigny have obtained

491
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:03,350
of a triumphal entrance

492
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:06,502
in the City Council
of the City of Paris?

493
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,327
We ask ourselves.

494
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:11,322
Instead of
an almost humiliating failure

495
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:14,658
he shed light on the urgent necessity

496
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,798
not to improve universal suffrage

497
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:20,248
but to abolish it.

498
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:25,579
During 2 months, the incomparable
polemist that was Paul Massigny,

499
00:38:25,614 --> 00:38:29,249
confined to newspaper columns,

500
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:32,093
methodically took his distance.

501
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:35,660
And then, speaking of
the proposal for a new law

502
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:39,308
on renewing banking privileges

503
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:42,735
that risked putting almost all of

504
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,015
the national wealth
in the hands of the Rothchilds,

505
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,212
Paul Massigny
threw himself at Minister Bridoux

506
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:52,294
with such ferocity

507
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,730
that the authorities
can't stay indifferent.

508
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:58,476
Accused in court

509
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:01,187
he is condemned to
3 months imprisonment

510
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:04,253
but he breathes freely
because a breach has been opened.

511
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:08,966
So, the all pervading
injustice has marked him.

512
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:13,710
And this time
in a vital part, in the soul.

513
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:17,549
Nevertheless, Massigny
carries out his managerial duties,

514
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:20,089
once this fire has been extinguished.

515
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:24,333
The number of subscribers
triples in a few weeks.

516
00:39:24,368 --> 00:39:28,450
His team of co-workers
closes ranks with him.

517
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:33,925
During the years,
Massigny is up against grand rivals.

518
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,283
Some of whom are honoring
us today with their presence,

519
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:39,332
others have died.

520
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:43,280
But nobody had
such significance, with such force

521
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:45,639
for the renewal of social thinking.

522
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,274
Because nobody
has been insulted so patiently,

523
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,874
for so long a time.

524
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,507
They will ask themselves:

525
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:58,705
why rekindle the fire of hate again.

526
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,456
But whoever believes to see hate here

527
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:06,173
only shows his heart is mixed up.

528
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:09,974
The profound cry
emitted by the work of Massigny,

529
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:14,728
which will resonate forever,
is that of a free man.

530
00:40:57,545 --> 00:40:58,674
Quick, close the windows!

531
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,592
Go and get water!

532
00:42:02,928 --> 00:42:05,437
I have not been able
to protect you, Julie.

533
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,031
I have to think of something
to have you closer to me.

534
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:52,614
Good day, sir.

535
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:59,175
I don't know if you remember me.
I came 2 weeks ago.

536
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,675
I've come to see if my order is ready.

537
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,391
Yes, yes, it's ready.

538
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:15,253
I hope you'll feel satisfied.

539
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:28,802
No, that's not it at all.
I'm very disappointed.

540
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:30,840
But it's exactly
as on the photo you gave me.

541
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,304
No, that's impossible, that's not her.

542
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,282
I don't want to take this thing.

543
00:43:34,317 --> 00:43:36,675
But sir, impossible,
with all the work I put into it!

544
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,132
- Here, I prefer to pay you.
- No way.

545
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,560
- Take the money, sir.
- I can't accept it.

546
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:43,445
- Take this money.
- No way.

547
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,015
Take this money and
destroy this right now, in front of me.

548
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,327
I can't do it.

549
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:48,805
Destroy this thing immediately.

550
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:12,866
There is no hope for me any more, Julie.

551
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:15,671
I had the impression
of losing you again.

552
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:18,955
I beg you, Julie, don't abandon me.

553
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:42,965
Sir, before granting you an audience,

554
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,762
I have to know more
about you and your project.

555
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,810
Your letter is not very explicit.

556
00:48:47,245 --> 00:48:49,855
Moreover, why this chapel?

557
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,994
It's been damaged by the war...

558
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,525
and we are not planning
to open it for service again.

559
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,367
Our diocese has a too few priests,

560
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:03,857
and those are called
to more urgent duties.

561
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:06,377
Tell me, what do you want to
do with it?

562
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:08,255
I want to take
responsibility for that chapel.

563
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,557
To take its restoration
and maintenance upon myself.

564
00:49:10,592 --> 00:49:11,987
I've chosen it precisely

565
00:49:12,022 --> 00:49:13,742
because it's been
abandoned by the faithful.

566
00:49:13,777 --> 00:49:16,227
By dedicating it to my dead
I will not remove its original goal.

567
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:19,308
What do you mean with "your dead"?

568
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:23,022
I think of all the persons
who counted in my life,

569
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:24,317
and who are not here any more.

570
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:26,784
For a long time I thought
that the memory was sufficient.

571
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,772
Now I know that I
have to do something more.

572
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:30,598
This chapel can help me.

573
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,672
Are you planning
to found some kind of sect?

574
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,572
Not at all. I only believe

575
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:36,506
that the moment has come
to offer the dead

576
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,515
testimony of the love
to which they are entitled.

577
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,867
Do you have links with freemasonry?

578
00:49:40,902 --> 00:49:42,856
Certainly not.

579
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:49,730
Do you have a spiritual leader
who can be responsible for you?

580
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:50,855
Well...

581
00:49:57,288 --> 00:50:00,445
I don't.
You'll have to have confidence in me.

582
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,610
- There's no choice.
- Are you a catholic?

583
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:08,398
For a long time
I've asked myself whether I had faith.

584
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:11,520
But now I'm sure and proud

585
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:14,608
of not having the faith
that many would wish for.

586
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:16,103
What does that mean?

587
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,677
What shocks me is the miserable way

588
00:50:17,712 --> 00:50:19,281
in which we forget the dead.

589
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,788
I want to repair that injustice.

590
00:50:20,823 --> 00:50:22,826
They don't have
celebrations, no honor,

591
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:24,577
no shelter, no security.

592
00:50:24,612 --> 00:50:27,010
How this wish
to rescue from oblivion came about,

593
00:50:27,011 --> 00:50:29,409
I couldn't tell you,
but I've invented them a ritual.

594
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:32,642
And because you dispose of some money,

595
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:35,840
you'd like to realize that cult.

596
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:41,005
That's it. I've thought of candles.
Each dead would have his own.

597
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,656
And together they'd form
a forest of lighted flames,

598
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:44,053
day and night for their memory.

599
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,202
A forest of flames?

600
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:53,738
I don't know what to tell you.

601
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,893
The church
doesn't appreciate excesses at all.

602
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:07,596
Hello,
you didn't want to see me anymore?

603
00:52:07,631 --> 00:52:11,109
I thought it was you
who didn't want to see me.

604
00:52:11,844 --> 00:52:15,224
Sure, but the last time your goodbye

605
00:52:15,259 --> 00:52:17,392
was like an order to silence.

606
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:19,677
You haven't felt tempted
to break that order?

607
00:52:19,712 --> 00:52:23,422
No, I've been raised to be obedient.

608
00:52:23,957 --> 00:52:27,250
Me too, I know obedience.

609
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:30,351
I didn't want
to avoid you, on the contrary.

610
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:32,882
Since our last meeting
something has happened

611
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,635
that made me come closer to your ideas.

612
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,380
Our dead,

613
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:43,667
our poor dead,

614
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,636
they ask so little,
and they obtain even less.

615
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:49,791
I often find myself right here.

616
00:52:49,826 --> 00:52:52,301
I think I don't like cemeteries,

617
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,704
they're cold prisons
where they lock up the dead,

618
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,998
to get rid of them
under the frozen soil.

619
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:59,374
No, I don't think so.

620
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,715
They're at home, below the ground.

621
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,825
Do you know that
the Chinese opposed the construction

622
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,629
of the railroad for a long time?

623
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:07,121
They couldn't bear

624
00:53:07,122 --> 00:53:08,979
that the soil
of the dead would be touched.

625
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:10,944
I think that,
if so many people honored them,

626
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:12,474
it's because they feared them.

627
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:15,127
But we, we love them.

628
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:16,287
True?

629
00:53:16,322 --> 00:53:19,063
Yes, you're right, we love them.

630
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:24,360
Listen, I have a big project.

631
00:53:24,395 --> 00:53:25,863
It's still early to talk about it,

632
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:28,214
but you'll be the first
to know about it.

633
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:31,193
But please be careful.

634
00:53:31,194 --> 00:53:33,837
You worry me with you initiatives.

635
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:30,447
It's a letter from the bishop.

636
00:54:30,482 --> 00:54:33,554
I'm very happy.

637
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:38,190
We're going to repair the chapel.

638
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:44,949
There will be works, scaffoldings.

639
00:54:44,984 --> 00:54:50,441
I'll take you with me.

640
00:54:50,476 --> 00:54:54,487
There will be many painters.

641
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:59,795
We're going to work together.

642
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,706
Ah yes, very well.

643
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:22,277
Thank you, Georges.

644
00:56:28,153 --> 00:56:29,258
She's pretty, isn't she?

645
00:56:29,696 --> 00:56:31,842
Yes, Julie was very pretty.

646
00:56:31,877 --> 00:56:35,346
I understood
that Julie'd be with us always...

647
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:38,012
as long as I'd live
amidst everything that belonged to her.

648
00:56:38,047 --> 00:56:40,253
But I'm going to make more for her.

649
00:56:40,288 --> 00:56:43,296
A final refuge
where she'll shine in all her splendor.

650
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,987
An altar of light
where she will be the central flame.

651
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:53,825
Julie, eternally young,
loyal, courageous,

652
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,309
magnificent Julie.

653
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:57,010
Alright Georges, go.

654
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:59,299
If you think
I'm an old fool, you're right.

655
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,043
Bring it to the car.

656
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:17,739
Thank you, Georges.

657
00:57:22,766 --> 00:57:24,060
Thank you, madam.

658
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,292
Bye bye, see you this evening.

659
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:56,815
You see,
I told you you'd be the first to know.

660
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,549
The moment has come. Come with me

661
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,314
and excuse me
if I don't tell you anything more.

662
00:58:00,463 --> 00:58:03,146
- Do you trust me?
- Of course I trust you.

663
00:58:03,181 --> 00:58:05,829
Anyway, I find it very mysterious.

664
00:58:05,864 --> 00:58:08,532
I think you're going
to ask me to put a veil over my eyes.

665
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:09,816
No, I won't.

666
00:58:35,634 --> 00:58:39,131
Listen, I'm not ready yet.
I want you to wait for me here.

667
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:41,415
If you don't mind,
I'll come looking for you.

668
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,484
A little while more, please.

669
00:59:53,913 --> 00:59:55,010
Now we can enter.

670
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:17,093
My dead now have

671
01:01:17,154 --> 01:01:19,069
a place that is irrevocably theirs.

672
01:01:19,104 --> 01:01:22,058
And this old chapel will
no longer be a place of death,

673
01:01:22,093 --> 01:01:24,538
not a place of rest,
but a place of life.

674
01:01:24,573 --> 01:01:27,168
As long as we're alive,
you and I, these flames

675
01:01:27,203 --> 01:01:31,297
will continue to shine and breathe
to the rhythm of the human heart.

676
01:01:31,332 --> 01:01:33,558
None of them should be put out.

677
01:01:34,193 --> 01:01:36,435
But all these photos...

678
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,152
Did you know all these persons?

679
01:01:38,187 --> 01:01:39,861
Yes, they are
my friends who disappeared.

680
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,143
You are young,

681
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:42,791
but you'll see
that at a certain moment

682
01:01:42,826 --> 01:01:45,119
you know more dead people than living.

683
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:53,641
This man for example, who was he?

684
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:57,083
His name was
Simon Jardine, he was from Ireland.

685
01:01:57,118 --> 01:01:59,611
During the 30 years
he lived in our region,

686
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:01,717
the police and the justice dept.
didn't have much to do.

687
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,607
His reputation of integrity was such

688
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:06,207
that all who had disagreements

689
01:02:06,253 --> 01:02:08,510
preferred trading
to settle their conflicts.

690
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:11,812
And this couple?

691
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:14,482
They married in 1911.

692
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:16,604
For 3 years they were
always together, every day.

693
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:18,908
And when the mobilized him,

694
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:21,178
she wanted to jump out of the window.

695
01:02:21,213 --> 01:02:23,085
But the neighbors stopped her.

696
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,818
Later he deserted, because
he couldn't bear being without her.

697
01:02:25,853 --> 01:02:27,988
They managed to reach Holland...

698
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:30,123
where they died a few years ago.

699
01:02:30,158 --> 01:02:33,298
With an interval
of a few days, like Siamese twins.

700
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,431
Look at this man,
with his beautiful face.

701
01:02:39,466 --> 01:02:42,116
All his life he suffered from timidity.

702
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:44,675
I'd like to
tell you about him, but it's difficult.

703
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:46,713
You'd have to hear
the tone of his voice,

704
01:02:46,747 --> 01:02:48,449
which was extraordinary.

705
01:02:48,784 --> 01:02:52,592
This one is American.
He liked Europe so much,

706
01:02:52,607 --> 01:02:54,452
that he ended up
opting for English nationality.

707
01:02:54,487 --> 01:02:58,315
I knew him only a little,
but because of him,

708
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,915
I learned of
the importance of respect for our dead.

709
01:03:06,317 --> 01:03:07,436
And this little boy?

710
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:10,857
When I was still an adolescent,

711
01:03:10,892 --> 01:03:13,144
I saw him die, on a summer holiday.

712
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,702
He died of septicemia.

713
01:03:15,237 --> 01:03:17,883
This woman also died very young.

714
01:03:17,918 --> 01:03:20,444
But in the way
that all would like to die:

715
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:22,196
sleeping in her bed.

716
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,492
She went out
like the flame of one of these candles.

717
01:03:24,527 --> 01:03:26,930
I see that her family has written:

718
01:03:26,965 --> 01:03:28,984
remember her in your prayers.

719
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:31,503
Although this woman was
the irreverence incarnate.

720
01:03:31,538 --> 01:03:34,283
I remember her way
of halting an animated discussion.

721
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:36,271
She exclaimed: if God would exist,

722
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:38,225
I'd be the first to know about it.

723
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:43,729
And this soldier?

724
01:03:43,764 --> 01:03:46,755
Yes, it's a German soldier.

725
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,313
I'm one of his murderers,
because I was a gunner

726
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:51,039
that shot his plane down.

727
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,602
He seems to sleep.

728
01:03:52,637 --> 01:03:53,550
That's correct.

729
01:03:53,678 --> 01:03:55,759
It's the only photo we found of him.

730
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,097
Looking at this photo,

731
01:03:57,132 --> 01:04:00,156
it's difficult to consider him an enemy.

732
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:02,273
And that musician?

733
01:04:05,571 --> 01:04:06,723
Did you know him?

734
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:09,646
Yes, I had almost forgotten him.

735
01:04:09,681 --> 01:04:12,007
But one day, hearing a piece on the radio

736
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:13,479
that he had composed,

737
01:04:13,514 --> 01:04:15,669
I realized that his music,
full of quality and light,

738
01:04:15,704 --> 01:04:17,572
was the right one to accompany

739
01:04:17,573 --> 01:04:19,340
the memory of all my dead.

740
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:48,568
So they are all here.

741
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:52,668
All those you knew.

742
01:04:52,703 --> 01:04:54,726
All those who meant something to you.

743
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:56,981
Yes, they're all here.

744
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:04,902
And now I'd like to ask you something.

745
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:08,709
Can I?

746
01:05:19,738 --> 01:05:21,745
Cecilia, do you
accept to become, with me,

747
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:23,753
the guardian of this temple?

748
01:05:23,788 --> 01:05:25,754
To share its rights and duties?

749
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:30,099
Do you accept to care
for them with me, for all of them?

750
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:33,365
Don't answer me right away,
think it over if you want.

751
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,635
But let me tell you that I've waited

752
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,055
for this moment for a long time.

753
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,953
For a very long time.

754
01:05:38,504 --> 01:05:41,681
I wish that my dead be yours.

755
01:05:41,716 --> 01:05:43,812
And in turn, that yours be mine too.

756
01:05:43,847 --> 01:05:46,671
Don't think that this set is finished.

757
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:49,123
There's place for all of your dead.

758
01:05:49,158 --> 01:05:51,822
Their flames will simply
add themselves to these.

759
01:05:51,857 --> 01:05:53,974
Tell me what you wish.

760
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:56,623
What I wish?

761
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,021
Do you want to know?

762
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:02,611
I wish that all these flames mingle

763
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:08,019
to form a mountain of light,

764
01:06:08,054 --> 01:06:09,910
one big luminosity.

765
01:06:11,689 --> 01:06:13,103
Do you mean that in your life

766
01:06:13,104 --> 01:06:14,518
there's only place for one celebration?

767
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,661
Yes, one celebration.

768
01:06:16,696 --> 01:06:19,850
I want to make sure
that I understood you.

769
01:06:19,885 --> 01:06:22,128
In a way that
all your dead are only one?

770
01:06:25,655 --> 01:06:27,923
One only, yes.

771
01:06:52,953 --> 01:06:54,100
Georges!

772
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,391
What did you do
with the plates? What did you do?

773
01:07:01,081 --> 01:07:02,743
Go to bed. No supper.

774
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,437
- What did you do to him?
- I've sent him to bed.

775
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:10,012
He broke my plates.

776
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:36,300
You, come here!

777
01:08:52,246 --> 01:08:53,555
Cecilia, do you want to help me?

778
01:08:53,556 --> 01:08:55,521
The important thing is to find that boy.

779
01:08:55,556 --> 01:08:57,384
Does Georges have
family or friends around here?

780
01:08:57,419 --> 01:08:59,151
No, just Mrs. Rambaud,

781
01:08:59,152 --> 01:09:00,884
my housekeeper, who takes care of him.

782
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:03,003
Listen, on the one hand
there are the hospitals,

783
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:06,122
on the other the police.
Let's divide the task.

784
01:09:06,151 --> 01:09:08,523
- You go to the hospital.
- Yes, that's it.

785
01:09:24,475 --> 01:09:26,214
They didn't put him here,
he'll be in the other.

786
01:09:28,975 --> 01:09:29,997
Wait here, miss.

787
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:43,507
Where can that little brat be?

788
01:09:43,508 --> 01:09:45,731
Ah, here he is. Let's go, out.

789
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,506
What are you doing under there?

790
01:09:53,927 --> 01:09:57,341
Don't be afraid. I will bring you home.

791
01:09:57,925 --> 01:09:59,773
Drink, my little one.

792
01:10:05,882 --> 01:10:07,540
Sorry to hear about your money trouble.

793
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,680
But I can't help thinking

794
01:10:10,681 --> 01:10:12,141
that those conferences are a good thing.

795
01:10:12,176 --> 01:10:15,215
They are occasions
for people to know your works.

796
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,188
True, until now I lacked ambition,

797
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:20,071
probably because I was alone.

798
01:10:20,106 --> 01:10:22,547
But now there's
that chapel to maintain, so that...

799
01:10:23,782 --> 01:10:25,760
When will you leave?

800
01:10:25,795 --> 01:10:28,564
The day after tomorrow. But don't worry.

801
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:31,641
Since I have the chapel,
my dead defend me.

802
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,088
I have the impression
that they protect me.

803
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:34,326
I'm sure you understand me.

804
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:38,445
Yes, I feel almost the same as you.

805
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,596
But for you, that chapel
reconciles you with your future.

806
01:10:42,631 --> 01:10:44,297
and for me, with my past.

807
01:10:45,615 --> 01:10:47,310
Little by little I'm accepting the idea

808
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:49,005
that I'm caring for it with you.

809
01:10:50,034 --> 01:10:51,947
It feels like getting out of an illness.

810
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:53,981
To go towards the cure.

811
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:56,959
Don't know if I told you before, but

812
01:10:56,994 --> 01:11:00,225
without knowing, you've helped me a lot.

813
01:11:00,877 --> 01:11:03,895
And you're going to help me even more.

814
01:11:04,338 --> 01:11:06,881
While I'm away,
you'll be the temple's guardian.

815
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:09,949
Yes, the guardian. Here's the key.

816
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,389
Besides, another thing.

817
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,468
Cecilia, I've chosen you as the one

818
01:11:18,469 --> 01:11:20,113
who will complete the whole.

819
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:21,714
Complete the whole?

820
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:24,564
Yes, that will happen
when the last candle will be lighted,

821
01:11:24,599 --> 01:11:26,363
and I want you
to be the one who will light it.

822
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:27,318
But which one?

823
01:11:28,763 --> 01:11:31,265
Mine, Cecilia, when the moment comes.

824
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,702
Have a good trip.

825
01:11:37,889 --> 01:11:40,863
Tell me, have you thought about,
that if one day

826
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:43,837
I have to light a candle for you,

827
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:47,350
then, who will light a candle for me?

828
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:29,023
- Hello.
- Hello, come in.

829
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:35,019
- Did you come back yesterday?
- Yes. No, this morning.

830
01:13:35,054 --> 01:13:36,807
I traveled all night,
I arrived this morning.

831
01:13:38,231 --> 01:13:40,876
Anne, go on with
that part, I'll be right back.

832
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:42,917
Could you wait for a moment?

833
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,923
The lesson is almost over.

834
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:48,302
It's the first time I visited your house.

835
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:50,771
I wonder if I shouldn't take
some piano lessons.

836
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:52,124
Piano lessons?

837
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,939
Yes, if I would be your pupil
I'd have something on you.

838
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:56,704
You want to have something on me?

839
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:00,686
I'll ask you something.

840
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:03,412
What's the color of my eyes?

841
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:07,163
Wait... no... I admit that...

842
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:08,963
You see?

843
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,600
What's up? Are you going?

844
01:15:15,942 --> 01:15:17,687
I shouldn't have come here.

845
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,262
On entering that door
I've ruined everything.

846
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,000
Listen miss, give me 2215 please.

847
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:52,623
Hello Albert, it's me, Julien.

848
01:16:52,658 --> 01:16:55,540
You call me at this hour?
Whatâ€™s happened to you?

849
01:16:55,775 --> 01:16:59,160
Excuse me, it's about Massigny,
I need to know something.

850
01:16:59,195 --> 01:17:00,972
I know he was married several times, but

851
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:03,973
where did he live the last 10 years?

852
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
What were his relationships?

853
01:17:05,002 --> 01:17:06,331
I want to know the name of the person

854
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:08,092
who could best inform me
about him,

855
01:17:08,127 --> 01:17:10,992
and I need to know who
was his last lover.

856
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:13,376
Listen, I don't know what
happened between Massigny and you,

857
01:17:13,377 --> 01:17:14,851
and I don't want to know it.

858
01:17:13,886 --> 01:17:16,130


859
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,374
You're starting to bother everybody.

860
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:20,720
Within a month we stop working together.

861
01:17:20,755 --> 01:17:23,779
Allow me a piece of advice,
forget your hate of Massigny,

862
01:17:23,814 --> 01:17:25,685
it's really below your dignity.

863
01:17:39,491 --> 01:17:42,663
Even though you
might think I have no dignity, I came.

864
01:17:49,807 --> 01:17:53,442
I'm here to know. I need to know.

865
01:17:53,977 --> 01:17:56,100
One day you told me that all your dead

866
01:17:56,101 --> 01:17:57,462
were one.

867
01:17:57,497 --> 01:17:59,131
Now I know everything.

868
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:01,740
I know that
this unique dead was Paul Massigny.

869
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:07,686
Yes, it's Paul Massigny.

870
01:18:09,883 --> 01:18:10,889
Did you know him?

871
01:18:10,924 --> 01:18:14,052
Yes, he was my friend in adolescence

872
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:15,200
and during my whole youth.

873
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:17,498
But he betrayed me.

874
01:18:17,533 --> 01:18:19,293
He destroyed the faith I had in life.

875
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:20,719
He taught me suspicion.

876
01:18:22,246 --> 01:18:24,191
Me too, at times I thought I hated him.

877
01:18:25,758 --> 01:18:28,575
But when he died I realized
that I could never forget him.

878
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:31,616
He was very good
in seducing, dominating, subjugating.

879
01:18:31,651 --> 01:18:34,218
Even today,
Massigny manages to trouble my life...

880
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,251
he separates us.

881
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:38,191
Now I know there was a bond between you,

882
01:18:38,226 --> 01:18:40,607
I want to know more
and I'm ashamed of this curiosity.

883
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:45,146
And why didn't you talk to 
me about him?

884
01:18:47,373 --> 01:18:49,474
While he lived,
I had no right to talk about him.

885
01:18:50,887 --> 01:18:52,252
Anyway, I had no right at all.

886
01:18:52,287 --> 01:18:54,609
Our history did not belong to me.

887
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:57,183
When he died, remember,

888
01:18:57,184 --> 01:18:59,723
it was the time I stopped seeing you.

889
01:18:59,758 --> 01:19:02,390
It made no sense
any more to talk about him.

890
01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:04,636
Our history was finished.

891
01:19:06,931 --> 01:19:09,791
About the cemetery,
where we met by chance,

892
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:13,080
Did you never ask yourself
which tomb I was visiting?

893
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,166
Yes, but at the moment
I had the feeling

894
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,218
of opening a letter
that was not addressed to me.

895
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,754
Well, now we have
one more thing in common.

896
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:23,775
You and I have suffered by him.

897
01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:29,075
It's true
that Paul led me almost to despair.

898
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:31,101
But I've forgiven him.

899
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,767
I've also forgiven him.

900
01:19:37,768 --> 01:19:41,176
Ah, that's good.

901
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:43,199
I shouldn't have doubted you.

902
01:19:44,282 --> 01:19:46,249
This place itself is the proof

903
01:19:46,284 --> 01:19:49,029
that hate has no place in you.

904
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:51,429
No, there's no place here for hate.

905
01:19:51,464 --> 01:19:53,503
Look at these flames,
look how the shine,

906
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:55,245
how they are alive.

907
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,249
I could call each one by its name,

908
01:19:57,284 --> 01:19:58,522
I recognize each candle.

909
01:19:58,857 --> 01:20:00,870
Where is Paul's candle?

910
01:20:00,905 --> 01:20:01,881
Pardon me?

911
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:04,569
Where is the candle of Paul Massigny?

912
01:20:04,604 --> 01:20:06,554
Why do we need
a candle for Paul Massigny?

913
01:20:06,589 --> 01:20:08,897
As if he's
present for you in this splendor.

914
01:20:08,932 --> 01:20:10,958
You just told me
that you had forgiven him.

915
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:12,223
Is he not one of your dead?

916
01:20:12,662 --> 01:20:14,630
No, he's one of the dead of this world.

917
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:16,750
And now I know he's yours,
but he's not one of mine.

918
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:19,463
Those who were
mine in life, are mine in death.

919
01:20:21,118 --> 01:20:23,437
But he was your friend in life,
even if he died.

920
01:20:23,472 --> 01:20:25,076
Those we have loved should...

921
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:27,050
Those are the ones
who can do us the most damage.

922
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:29,875
It's not true!
You have not forgiven him!

923
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:31,234
Goodbye.

924
01:20:34,179 --> 01:20:36,277
Where are you going?
Will I see you again?

925
01:20:36,312 --> 01:20:38,775
Never like before. And never here.

926
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,270
Come back!

927
01:20:40,305 --> 01:20:42,441
Where is Massigny's place?

928
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:44,239
I can't!
I cannot, why don't you understand?

929
01:20:44,274 --> 01:20:46,109
I can't consider him equal to the rest.

930
01:20:46,144 --> 01:20:47,932
Even in relation to them, I can't.

931
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:51,405
So, goodbye.

932
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,372
The enchantment is broken.

933
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,053
- Good morning doctor?
- Hello Mrs. Rambaud.

934
01:21:11,088 --> 01:21:12,746
- How did he pass the night?
- Not well.

935
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,337
He didn't sleep much.

936
01:21:14,372 --> 01:21:16,502
I heard him walking around.

937
01:21:19,369 --> 01:21:20,538
No, Doctor, he's not there.

938
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:23,126
He's upstairs, in his room.

939
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:24,858
He's locked
himself in the burned room.

940
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:27,516
Alright, I'll go and see him.

941
01:21:31,045 --> 01:21:32,340
Who's there, what's happening?

942
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,809
It's me Davenne,
I come to see you, as we agreed.

943
01:21:34,844 --> 01:21:36,543
Youâ€™d better go home.

944
01:21:36,578 --> 01:21:38,595
I've asked for nothing.
I don't need a doctor.

945
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:40,225
No one is ill in this house.

946
01:21:48,515 --> 01:21:50,722
One can't treat someone
who has lost the desire to live.

947
01:21:50,723 --> 01:21:52,727
Mrs. Rambaud, I have nothing to do here.

948
01:22:28,113 --> 01:22:30,497
A young woman wants to talk with you.

949
01:22:30,532 --> 01:22:32,795
She has no appointment,
but it's about Mr. Davenne.

950
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:37,179
Ah, Davenne! How is he?

951
01:22:37,214 --> 01:22:38,494
Not very well.

952
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:40,676
I met Mrs. Rambaud, his housekeeper,

953
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:43,311
he is in despair.

954
01:22:44,297 --> 01:22:46,115
Let that young lady in.

955
01:22:51,605 --> 01:22:54,086
Mr. Bishop expects you. Come in here.

956
01:23:05,204 --> 01:23:09,002
No, he went on a trip
to Scandinavia 2 months ago.

957
01:23:09,037 --> 01:23:11,251
But now he should be here.

958
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:15,455
Monique,
for how long haven't we seen Davenne?

959
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,302
Almost a week, sir.

960
01:23:17,337 --> 01:23:19,494
We've had to
delay his article for one issue.

961
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:22,655
Yes, he was
a bit strange after his return.

962
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:24,590
Do you know him well?

963
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:28,472
You are very charming,
he should have talked to me about you.

964
01:23:28,507 --> 01:23:30,340
But really,

965
01:23:30,345 --> 01:23:32,265
he never talks about his personal life.

966
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,933
Yes, he's very secretive.

967
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:37,647
And anyway,
you surely know him better than I do.

968
01:23:37,682 --> 01:23:40,432
I met him in my adolescence,

969
01:23:40,467 --> 01:23:42,366
and then we lost sight of each other.

970
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:45,694
And we met again
last year, accidentally.

971
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,077
To tell the truth,

972
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,685
he had changed a lot recently.

973
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,123
I should've been more inquisitive.

974
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:54,662
We have avoided
each other, and now I regret

975
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:56,658
not to have urged him
to explain himself.

976
01:23:56,693 --> 01:23:59,534
At times it's difficult
to be open between colleagues.

977
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:03,413
But... you are troubled.

978
01:24:03,448 --> 01:24:05,642
You can tell me everything.

979
01:24:05,677 --> 01:24:07,791
You like him a lot?

980
01:24:08,726 --> 01:24:11,747
I've seen him several times this year.

981
01:24:11,782 --> 01:24:14,938
And I didn't think
he'd mean so much in my life.

982
01:24:14,973 --> 01:24:16,417
I don't know.

983
01:24:16,452 --> 01:24:19,603
And in his life,

984
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,303
what place do you have in it?

985
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:24,827
How to know that!

986
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:27,398
He seems to like
seeing me, talking with me.

987
01:24:27,433 --> 01:24:30,984
But I've noticed
that if I fail an appointment,

988
01:24:31,019 --> 01:24:34,939
he wouldn't try
to find me or give me a sign of life.

989
01:24:34,974 --> 01:24:37,569
We'd surely pass 10 years
without seeing each other.

990
01:24:37,604 --> 01:24:40,021
With him, you never know what to expect.

991
01:24:40,056 --> 01:24:42,450
You don't have to be a wizard to guess.

992
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:45,414
I believe that you love that man.

993
01:24:48,756 --> 01:24:50,099
Excuse me if I insist.

994
01:24:50,134 --> 01:24:54,167
Does Davenne know your feelings for him?

995
01:24:54,202 --> 01:24:56,097
Does he know you love him?

996
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:59,418
You think that would make a difference?

997
01:24:59,453 --> 01:25:01,690
Davenne is a man like any man.

998
01:25:01,725 --> 01:25:04,838
He needs to love and be loved.

999
01:25:04,873 --> 01:25:07,289
If he makes believe
that he's used to solitude,

1000
01:25:07,324 --> 01:25:09,105
he's lying to himself.

1001
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:12,708
Nobody really likes solitude.

1002
01:25:12,743 --> 01:25:15,748
Make your feelings known to him.

1003
01:25:15,783 --> 01:25:18,602
Act, don't let a misunderstanding

1004
01:25:18,603 --> 01:25:21,422
stand between you two.

1005
01:25:41,161 --> 01:25:43,489
What? You bring me food again?

1006
01:25:43,524 --> 01:25:46,426
I told you I'm not hungry.

1007
01:25:46,461 --> 01:25:50,213
It's Ms. Cecilia on the telephone.

1008
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:52,557
I don't want to talk to her.

1009
01:25:52,592 --> 01:25:55,136
I don't want to talk to anyone,
I don't need anything.

1010
01:25:55,171 --> 01:25:56,941
Myself is enough for me.

1011
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:04,492
Even though you refuse to talk
to me, you'll accept to read my letter.

1012
01:26:04,527 --> 01:26:05,952
I have to write you things

1013
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:07,778
that I never dared to tell you,

1014
01:26:07,813 --> 01:26:09,580
because you are unpredictable,

1015
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,347
and at times your reactions frighten me.

1016
01:26:11,382 --> 01:26:14,329
And because I myself
have been slow to face these things.

1017
01:26:14,364 --> 01:26:17,950
Like you, I know
it's not easy to live with the living.

1018
01:26:17,985 --> 01:26:20,334
It's easier with the dead.

1019
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:22,318
They are locked
within the transparent walls

1020
01:26:22,353 --> 01:26:24,083
of our imagination.

1021
01:26:24,118 --> 01:26:26,180
What you didn't understand,
and what I've have to tell you,

1022
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:27,812
is that I love you.

1023
01:26:27,877 --> 01:26:29,790
But I know that to be loved by you

1024
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,300
I have to be dead.

1025
01:27:17,409 --> 01:27:19,242
Cecilia...

1026
01:27:19,777 --> 01:27:21,830
I received your letter.

1027
01:27:21,956 --> 01:27:24,025
Forget that letter.

1028
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,116
- Cecilia...
- Don't say anything.

1029
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:27,707
Let me talk.

1030
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:32,717
This afternoon, by sheer luck,

1031
01:27:32,752 --> 01:27:35,692
the feeling
that separated us has left me.

1032
01:27:35,727 --> 01:27:37,587
Something has changed in me.

1033
01:27:37,622 --> 01:27:39,283
To come back here, right away,

1034
01:27:39,284 --> 01:27:40,944
that was the important thing.

1035
01:27:40,979 --> 01:27:43,529
From now on
we'll come for the same reason.

1036
01:27:43,564 --> 01:27:46,047
We are alike.

1037
01:27:52,723 --> 01:27:55,999
I'm not here to ask for anything.

1038
01:27:56,034 --> 01:27:57,929
I am here for them.

1039
01:27:57,964 --> 01:28:00,096
They are here for you.

1040
01:28:00,131 --> 01:28:03,296
This night,
they are more present than ever.

1041
01:28:03,331 --> 01:28:05,491
They say
there is a place for Paul Massigny.

1042
01:28:05,526 --> 01:28:06,881
Forget about Massigny!

1043
01:28:06,916 --> 01:28:08,461
They say there is an vacant spot.

1044
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:10,889
They say that
the whole isn't complete yet.

1045
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:14,145
Don't talk about
that vacant spot, forget about it.

1046
01:28:20,619 --> 01:28:22,513
Julien!

1047
01:28:26,094 --> 01:28:29,878
One is missing, just one.

1048
01:28:29,913 --> 01:28:32,533
Nothing is missing!

1049
01:28:32,568 --> 01:28:35,602
Only one, one more candle.

1050
01:28:35,637 --> 01:28:37,926
Then the whole will be complete.

1051
01:28:37,961 --> 01:28:40,260
Julien!

1052
01:28:40,295 --> 01:28:45,017
Cecilia, what has happened between us,

1053
01:28:45,052 --> 01:28:51,357
I know what has happened.
Nothing has happened, nothing.

1054
01:28:53,306 --> 01:28:54,510
Julien!

1055
01:30:09,346 --> 01:30:11,334
Julien Davenne.
