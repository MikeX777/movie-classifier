00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,884
<i> OFF BALANCE
(Un Delitto Poco Comune)</ i>

2
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
Sorry...

3
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,109
Can I talk to you in particular?

4
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,741
Not that I'm not happy
with your success...

5
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,177
I fear only that will separate us.

6
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,449
Susanna, your mother is right...

7
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,605
You are very regular... Want
draw them all...

8
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,975
The
say this because I think our future?

9
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,810
Leaves for London,
I do not know how and you say now!

10
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,177
What does the future hold for you?

11
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,975
To marry and to have children?

12
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,041
The all like it's a bad thing!

13
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,537
Is it bad if the only
target of our bond.

14
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,973
This is absurd, Robert.

15
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,789
But suddenly
I start to feel uncomfortable...

16
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,905
As if talking to a stranger...

17
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,361
Dad, come and see.

18
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,469
Play a concert Dominici.
Amazing!

19
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,014
Dad was worried about you.
I had your new all day.

20
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,905
Why do not you come to the concert?

21
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,129
Shortly before the
concerto became a murder...

22
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,333
- Murder?
- The victim was a woman. Terrible crime!

23
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,061
Please, Dad, my non
ruin the evening!

24
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,197
Pour always the same scent...
Do I fit...

25
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,469
This toast was
me or my music?

26
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,952
For you were!

27
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,975
Well, I thought I hated.

28
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,313
I did not know it was so obvious
...

29
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,041
Maybe it's a kind of defense...

30
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,653
- Defense?
- You know very well what I mean.

31
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,946
It was so easy to fall in love...
Something usual...

32
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,952
And what has changed?

33
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,537
- Your music influenced me!
- Maybe the champagne!

34
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,490
Maybe! And the impact continues...
Maybe start a flirt...

35
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,878
I know... One night soon,
would invite me for dinner...

36
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,633
How are you so sure?

37
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,884
It is written!

38
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,401
Do not tell me how you
predict the future!

39
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,293
Sometimes, yes.

40
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,701
Okay... I give up...

41
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,129
I'm sorry... I can not concentrate today...

42
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,975
According to the autopsy, the
death was instantaneous...

43
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,878
The blade cut the carotid artery.
Fingerprints found many.

44
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,857
- And the gun too?
- Neither the gun.

45
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,612
I knew!

46
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,558
I'm afraid I only left the deposit
candy from the first floor...

47
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,975
He says he saw a 30 year old new
coming from the building...

48
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,975
But, this can be any
...

49
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,333
I know, but the only clue we have
...

50
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000
<i> heinous crime in Perugia </ i>

51
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,170
<i> They killed young doctor
with Napoleonic sword </ i>

52
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,789
<i> Huge success
Robert Dominici </ i>

53
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,109
Okay! We're done for today.

54
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,020
Leaving already?

55
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,789
Both got this
we wanted, right?

56
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,680
What say?

57
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,810
You proved that you can 
get me from Robert.

58
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,585
And I think I can do without him.

59
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,810
Not true. From my own
perspective at least.

60
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,565
From mine, it is!

61
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,429
You go to his house?

62
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,975
Is it right to play
so with my feelings?

63
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,612
Hurts!

64
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,020
I do not like...

65
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,313
I did not understand how you felt...

66
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,837
Forget it... Go now...

67
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,500
Get...

68
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,680
Sorry...

69
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,769
= = Do you want to go to the station?

70
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,020
No thanks.

71
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,762
No, your promised. No more
ultimatums. Not a word about marriage.

72
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,449
Only when
if you so wish...

73
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,653
I just am
near you, Robert.

74
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,680
Where are you?

75
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,701
I come there... 
I love you!

76
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,361
This is yours.

77
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,041
I went out... I do not know why...

78
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,177
As if I had a premonition...

79
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,946
Current many mad at
streets nowadays...

80
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,197
When I found the...
eyes were open...

81
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,177
But I knew he was already dead...

82
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,361
I do not know what to do!

83
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,925
And what makes
me feel worse...

84
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,537
... is that we had a fight last
silly...

85
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,469
Only tonight we realized how
really love!

86
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,857
Only find this
murders, police!

87
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,789
Stop before
kill and others!

88
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,401
- Loves Susanna;
- Maybe... And what with that?

89
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,354
Slept with her, even though it was
mistress of your best friend.

90
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,975
You take what you want, and
your heartbreak for others!

91
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,975
Listen! To recline together
both have to want...

92
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,789
The Susanna came only
in my home...

93
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,975
There raped
in the middle of the road, of course!

94
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,449
Okay, okay...
I take it back.

95
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,401
You're a gentleman.
You can go now.

96
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,265
- David, how old are you?
- Twenty-four.

97
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,975
Did you, by chance, the doctor knew
Carla Pesenti;

98
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,537
You ask if I
alibi for the night that killed her?

99
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,177
- You have an alibi?
- No, I have not!

100
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,109
But the killer certainly has!

101
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,769
<I> will capture the killer </ i>

102
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,088
I can spend?

103
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,293
Now I understand...

104
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,701
On your days calling...

105
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,993
I did not want to see nor
to talk to anyone.

106
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,605
I can not stand the persons
look at me with sympathy.

107
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,633
Maybe I show myself so.

108
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,993
The grief of others
helps your own!

109
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,129
Not let you reactions
and forget.

110
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,293
How do you manage?

111
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,020
The coax...

112
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,653
You were very much in love with Susanna;

113
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,224
I do not remember anymore...

114
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,333
When I think about it, I see before me
dead...

115
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,014
Her death is the most lively
picture of me now!

116
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,701
Tormenting yourself!

117
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,293
I came to help you.

118
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,224
I'm alive.

119
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,973
Without obligation, of course.

120
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,361
It is a pity, Helene...

121
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,020
What is shame?

122
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,653
You said the right thing
at the wrong time.

123
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,810
How would like to hear these words
another time!

124
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,361
I love you, Robert...

125
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,293
And no hurry...

126
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,701
Hi, Dad! What's new

127
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,993
Do not answer! The
Your face says it all!

128
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,449
Sit down to your
prepare something now...

129
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,975
Thank you, dear.
I have not eaten anything today.

130
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,975
You know Dad...

131
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,585
often think the
mom angry...

132
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,401
... Because you never
regular working hours.

133
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,517
Well, now
I understand perfectly.

134
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,857
This is the right
job for you!

135
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,500
Hello?

136
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,500
What?

137
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,500
Dad?

138
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,500
Hello?

139
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,381
You'd think that you can catch me?

140
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,673
A month passed and you're still there
you started!

141
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,975
Do you hear me? 
Are you still there?

142
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,020
Yes, here I am.

143
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,857
Good! I will say something
will you like...

144
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,497
We will never catch me!

145
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,973
I can kill whoever I want!

146
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,293
Yes! I'll go crazy!

147
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,224
By the way...

148
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,061
Your daughter was that
picked up the phone?

149
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,837
Cute... Cute...

150
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,816
What did she say?

151
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,401
Someone was crazy... No
I made no sense...

152
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,837
Current many such!

153
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,653
Is the right job for me...

154
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,061
... but come moments
who abhor.

155
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,975
You are very smart and
confident about yourself...

156
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,946
But with an opponent who is not
falls on your traps...

157
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,837
... you have no hope!

158
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,129
Honor to lose by
an opponent like you!

159
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,952
What are you doing here?

160
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,680
Sorry...

161
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,497
I'm a little drunk.

162
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,905
I was returning here and there for hours.

163
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,585
Not even know how
finally got here!

164
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,673
Tell me where you got the whiskey.
Will be served myself.

165
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,429
You will not find ever!

166
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,673
The hide lest thy
drink your guests?

167
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,449
No, just
is a beautiful piece of furniture.

168
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,544
Robert;

169
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,605
<I> Thanks for everything... For
kindness you showed... </ i>

170
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,422
<I> I have to leave for a while, but I will
have you with me, in my heart. </ I>

171
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,041
Robert, what a pleasant surprise!

172
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,197
Not believe it when the
dwarf said he will come!

173
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,975
A joy you are! Shortly
unshaven perhaps...

174
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,401
Newbie are you?
Did you stay a few days?

175
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,401
- I'll stay a few days.
- Very glad, Robert.

176
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,905
Great! Great, my son!

177
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,156
And they also...

178
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,975
Not exactly what
I was hoping to find...

179
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,313
... but better than nothing!

180
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,265
- How about you?
- If I knew what you looking for...

181
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,585
Why would someone
kill a doctor?

182
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,313
Perhaps because he wants to hide something.

183
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,469
You're two months here and
not even touched the piano!

184
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,041
And I do not want to see anyone!

185
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,975
I understand... you claimed
death of Susanna...

186
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,857
But, we should not resign from life!

187
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,605
You lose your freshness...
You look like mature man...

188
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,585
And it makes me feel more
old...

189
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,449
What can I do
to help you?

190
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,333
There is nothing, mother.
Will pass, you see...

191
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,952
I'll leave tomorrow.

192
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,673
I know... It's hard when
start to lose...

193
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,265
You'll get used to it... I
I started very young...

194
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,789
At forty, my
youth was lost!

195
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,633
To see the bulletins.

196
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,973
You, Robert; We await you!

197
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,156
Come in, come in.

198
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,361
He means.
Seats.

199
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,020
I come immediately.

200
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,878
I will not tell lies, Robert.
When you want the truth...

201
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,197
is what we fear.
There is no doubt.

202
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,837
You're very unlucky, Robert.

203
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,381
Your case is very rare.

204
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,975
It is a disease that usually
occurs in childhood.

205
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,975
Anyway. In
conference will go in Paris...

206
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,381
... I will discuss your case
.

207
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,605
I'll be honest.
I do not think there are hopes.

208
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,946
The disease certainly
initially manifested in childhood.

209
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,741
Stayed in a latent form,
and revealed just now.

210
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,952
It's a shame...

211
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,333
A rare virus, with very
long incubation period.

212
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,857
And now that the disease
activated...

213
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,975
... definitely will
rapid evolution.

214
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,975
Warned. Maybe
affected brain cells.

215
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,975
And this will result
someone abnormal psyche.

216
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,653
There were a few similar cases.

217
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,537
You must enter
clinic for monitoring.

218
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,769
To see me die?

219
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,500
Front?

220
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,224
Helene, I'm...

221
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,313
Robert! And once
in thinking!

222
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,401
It is no coincidence... All
time to think...

223
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,497
This is wonderful...

224
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,680
How are you?

225
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,605
I want to tell you something that has
make me happy...

226
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,769
Waiting child, Robert...

227
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,224
- Really?
- Yes!

228
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,837
Your own child, Robert!

229
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,224
My own child?

230
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,769
These though are good news!

231
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,975
You can begin with this tomorrow...

232
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,975
- Goodnight.
- Okay, goodnight.

233
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,381
Hey, Helene.
Will you tomorrow.

234
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,265
- Good night, sir.
- Goodnight, Luciano.

235
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,469
Dr. Vanni, from the criminals
ture laboratory...

236
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,061
will examine for signs of
the murderer...

237
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,401
Some hair, a fiber
below the nails...

238
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,565
should be done immediately?

239
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,061
I want it too! Traces,
if there are natural...

240
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,313
... not lost!
Sorry...

241
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,088
Good morning, sir.

242
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,769
Can I ask what you say?

243
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,469
I asked the doctor if there
risk to the baby.

244
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,449
- The baby?
- Me sorry...

245
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,973
Do you know who the father is?

246
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,449
It's not
hid the Helene...

247
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,565
It's so happy!

248
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,585
Father is the
Robert Dominici.

249
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,653
The Robert Dominici...
pianist...

250
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,673
Very unfortunate as women
of Robert Dominici.

251
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,156
I knew once...

252
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,565
And this killing...

253
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,517
The great talent...
genius...

254
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,449
All women
him fall in love...

255
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,286
By laughed once, Robert
Dominici. You were very convincing.

256
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,109
But now I will not save you!

257
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,952
The Vanni was...

258
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,975
They found pieces of skin on the nails of the girl...

259
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,197
Call him and tell
to go to sleep...

260
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,975
I want the results of the examinations
tomorrow morning...

261
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,884
Go now!

262
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,088
Break the door!

263
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,975
You sure, Captain?
You will find trouble!

264
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,082
When it comes to such a
killer, no one speaks.

265
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,469
- And if not that?
- Of course he is!

266
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,177
All the evidence lead at him!

267
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,905
I do not think longer lives here.

268
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,905
If so... I'll find him!

269
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,001
I want to have a constant
surveillance of this house.

270
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,224
24 hours per 24-hour period!

271
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,741
- You look so happy?
- I have every reason to be.

272
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,975
- How is the girl?
- Better than I expected.

273
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,129
Is bouncing agency.
You can view.

274
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,401
Is one ours through...
They make the sketch.

275
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,265
- Who is this?
- The sketch of the killer.

276
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,816
Kidding?

277
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,789
It was dark... I
terrified...

278
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,265
For a moment I saw him...
Only they remember...

279
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,150
But the killer is 30 years.
We know this for sure!

280
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,401
He went on to kill
was elderly...

281
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,333
had wrinkles
and very little hair...

282
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,993
Do not weary now.
See you next time.

283
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,061
Explained it.
Saw the face of Robert.

284
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,878
Subconsciously, replaced
image to another...

285
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,857
A psychologist will explain better...

286
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,975
Your reference should be
ready before two hours.

287
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,721
'm Late because something strange happens
...

288
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,673
The killer is not new ..
is around sixty...

289
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,975
- It is not possible!
- I checked three times.

290
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,721
Then, you were wrong
all three times.

291
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,565
How is this possible?

292
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,993
Continue the investigations for the killer...

293
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,381
Already margins have narrowed
...

294
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,925
The killer
is between 50 and 60 years...

295
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,925
He demonstrated by our laboratory...

296
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,333
I want the policeman Nteti...
It is very urgent...

297
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,769
We ask the phone...

298
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,313
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

299
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,500
Hello?

300
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,109
Handsome show on TV.

301
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,565
There you say well though...

302
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,993
For months asking a
killer 30 years...

303
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,129
... And suddenly, as if it
is over 50...

304
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,109
Think twice before you speak...

305
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,265
Otherwise, everyone will understand how
fool you...

306
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,680
Okay .. .

307
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,769
Let's start from the beginning.

308
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,041
With the murder of Carla Pesenti.

309
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,975
Already interrogate all
patients doctor.

310
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,975
Even this
American doctor...

311
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,993
... that would meet
medical conference.

312
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,975
In Paris... In Robert
Hutchison Gklifornt...

313
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,537
I requested information from 
the conference secretariat.

314
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,975
Maybe tell us what
why would meet.

315
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,500
Welcome.

316
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,469
I do not know to help
it, but anyway...

317
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,585
I was afraid that they would not
were here, Laura...

318
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,837
Only friends say Laura!

319
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,361
You're my friend?

320
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,265
You're the first woman to
which I love!

321
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,565
I was 20 years old then...

322
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,449
Let me see if I remember
who you are...

323
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,721
You were twenty...
And I, how was I?

324
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,680
Nineteen.

325
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,633
Help me, please.

326
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,605
And of course I remember you! Even
and now you're handsome!

327
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,973
In your twenties you were a doll!

328
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,673
Many say this...
I'm starting to believe it myself...

329
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,748
Girls...

330
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,177
Even friends of my mother!

331
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,925
But, preferably
come to me first!

332
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,500
Good!

333
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,497
I want to kiss me...

334
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,653
You want to say something to you like you were a child
...

335
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,517
So you want and
kiss on the mouth!

336
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,701
I don't like your type!

337
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,265
Why do you want to ask
forgiveness from the Lord?

338
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,544
Father...

339
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,680
Killed...

340
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,612
killed?

341
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,313
Killed... and
kill again...

342
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,313
Listen to me! 
You have to hear me!

343
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,381
I do not know,
Father Giuliano?

344
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,925
I'm Robert... The
Robert Dominici...

345
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,088
Are you the Robert;

346
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,429
The Robert Dominici;

347
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,224
It is possible!

348
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,497
How is it possible?

349
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,177
Because you look bigger?

350
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,537
Seems like yesterday that we did
friends in the evenings...

351
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,975
I was talking about music
and women...

352
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,701
... and you to God...

353
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,975
Nice game played
thy God!

354
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,748
Look at me!

355
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,973
Playing with my desperation...

356
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,333
God you make me and rot...
Inside and out...

357
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,565
My mind rot...

358
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,769
I can not help myself .. .

359
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,653
Nobody can
to hold...

360
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,109
Nobody... except the time...

361
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,313
Every day is like one month...

362
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,837
Each month as ten years!

363
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,401
Time is running out, and
I'm not ready...

364
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,333
We will not forsake God is merciful...
...

365
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,633
This is the mercy?

366
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,975
Give me absolution!

367
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,177
At least you,
give me absolution!

368
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,973
If not as a priest, as a friend!

369
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,156
Adrea! I feel!

370
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,429
I feel very impatient!

371
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,265
Get ready!
We have many things to buy!

372
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,265
Two months left... The
little pretentious!

373
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,975
- His father knows?
- That is demanding?

374
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,517
Not... That left
only two months!

375
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,816
What is your name?

376
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,061
You at least not talk...
I hope that is...

377
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,381
course not talk...
You dog...

378
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,993
Well if it begins
and you can talk...

379
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,721
With all those idiots
you date...

380
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,565
In ever loved?

381
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,449
Boss you ever had?
Sure you had!

382
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,653
Must
were very nice dog...

383
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,265
Only
is difficult to imagine now...

384
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,129
After Jerash and your
boss drove in...

385
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,721
And I'm sure
forgive him...

386
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,293
I did not forgive...

387
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,653
I hate them all...
young and old. ..

388
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,537
Them young because they have
front their lifetime...

389
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,061
old men because they had
a lifetime...

390
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,497
We will kill them all!

391
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,973
Sir police, the phone!

392
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,429
Lower the music!

393
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,816
That's it!

394
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,001
What you become, Datti;
He long time...

395
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,973
Come... Tell me the truth...

396
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,177
I am sure that with pethymises.

397
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,673
You know... all complain
for your failure...

398
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,497
And it saddens me very much!

399
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,952
I regret very much!

400
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,061
So I decided to give you a chance.

401
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,293
I want to help.

402
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,653
But this time
I want you to grab!

403
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,381
I'm going to take a look...
All...

404
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,952
You stay here!

405
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,293
It's all ready.

406
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,333
Do not shake anyone,
if I do not signal!

407
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,061
In my opinion, the guy
us make fun.

408
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,633
I do not know what to think...

409
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,197
Come to see how
things... Go!

410
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,905
I did not bring the dog today?

411
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,500
Not...

412
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,429
Do you like dogs?

413
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,633
Well, I will bring him tomorrow.

414
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,469
All is quiet here! Yes!
Tell him not to worry!

415
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,975
The police want to make sure
I have the gun ready.

416
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,993
Is right... Is
your first business.

417
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,769
I'll take a look around.

418
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,748
Go?

419
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,673
Nothing happens here. The
Antzelis looking around.

420
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,925
See you tomorrow.
Do not forget the dog!

421
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,837
Sorry... Do you have time?

422
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,156
Yes, five.

423
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,156
Then, it's time!

424
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,952
For what?

425
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,612
For this!

426
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,082
No, no... Do not yell! And
looking to find him... Gone!

427
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,905
I want my friend Datti.

428
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,088
Come on, call him!

429
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,109
Give me the police! Hurry!

430
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,500
Hello?

431
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,517
Hey, Datti...
I am again...

432
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,952
Are you ready?

433
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,313
Now is a great
your chance!

434
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,653
Get in the car!
For Us!

435
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,653
For Us!
Get in the car!

436
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,605
What we want us? In
killer to go to catch!

437
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,975
Leave quiet their law-abiding citizens!

438
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,993
We are here for over an hour.
Is a shame!

439
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,925
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, about thirty.

440
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,721
The crippled and
two old men to leave!

441
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,429
And the kids too!

442
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,361
Okay... You! Thou!

443
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,500
You!

444
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,748
You and you!

445
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,197
You can leave! For Us!
Follow me!

446
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,313
Okay. From here please.
Come!

447
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,265
Sorry about this, Helene.
Must be transparent as possible.

448
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,816
What is?

449
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,748
I do not know...

450
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,224
looked at them again.

451
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,816
What is?

452
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,429
I do not really know!

453
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,585
Helene, I know I'm asking
many of you.

454
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,286
But, you must help me.
One of them is the killer.

455
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,946
The woman who killed
today was a little younger than you.

456
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,429
And wanted to live...

457
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,109
Sir, you ask the phone.

458
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,517
- Who is it?
- It is very urgent!

459
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,857
Do you really want to arrest me, right?

460
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,993
However, stop torturing
the Helene now...

461
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,102
As for Helene, be warned:
Do not leave unfinished business!

462
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,993
Go home.
Will be glad your daughter.

463
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,789
Sleep tonight, and
tomorrow you again...

464
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,857
How is the Gloria;
Time I see her!

465
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,156
What are you doing, Datti;

466
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,381
You ask if they record the call?

467
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,810
If you want to know where
call, I'll say so myself!

468
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,701
Down here I am, in the cafe.

469
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,177
Get down to drink a coffee together.

470
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,429
You came to the window...

471
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,905
I like your shirt!

472
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,381
Yes! You go
blues, Datu!

473
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,975
- Where is he who was calling?
- I do not know!

474
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,769
Where are you, paliompastarde?

475
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,313
I know you're here, bitch son!

476
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,517
Revealed, you bastard!
I will kill you!

477
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,701
'll Kill you! Where are you?

478
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,061
How did he escape from the park?
We caught of them.

479
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,789
I do not know! He said that
would drive me crazy...

480
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,020
And it does...

481
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,469
A, here are you? At the funeral
disappeared suddenly...

482
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,001
Yes I know... When it came time to
condolences...

483
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,469
... I did not have the courage to face
her mom.

484
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,973
I do not know if you understand me.

485
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,156
Of course, the police.

486
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,701
'll Take them with me these.

487
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,653
Send legal
books in my house.

488
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,429
They have no value.

489
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,857
But I have since I was a student
.

490
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,449
- Not in drives one!
- I know!

491
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,197
I leave myself... Is
a matter of good taste...

492
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,993
First time brew
my suitcases...

493
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,857
But, many times you
travel with me!

494
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,975
In fact, I was preparing
our suitcases.

495
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,633
Do not make me cry...

496
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,633
I know... You're hard...

497
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,857
I know someone who will 
laugh if listened to you.

498
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,975
I hate him, even
for this, Dad!

499
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,975
Why should I leave you
and go to Rome.

500
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,150
Probably you are not in danger drom 
him, but I want to be sure.

501
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,975
Dad, why do not you come with me
? I will miss very...

502
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,354
I must arrange
few things. Then I will come.

503
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,156
Thy promise.

504
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,381
Do not go out, I'm
passer.

505
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,449
Once I took
Gloria at the Station.

506
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,469
- So now you're alone.
- Yes, but not for long.

507
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,741
I will leave for Rome.
I think that would shift there.

508
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,857
You know, Rome is
room for everyone.

509
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,810
Do not you think we should proceed
slightly ahead?

510
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,993
So you see the whole
home Helene!

511
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,633
Yes, yes... You're right!

512
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,769
Sorry for peremvasi.

513
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,653
Can not
overcome the poor guy!

514
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,449
So you went your daughter
at Station!

515
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,837
The train of 4:42 for Rome!

516
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,993
By the way... The
Gloria smokes too!

517
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,789
I saw two packs of cigarettes
in the bag!

518
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,565
Bad for health!

519
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,224
I had to see me!

520
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,156
I had a crisis...

521
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,633
I thought I would die...

522
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,088
It's the end...

523
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,905
You're lucky! You know why?

524
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,449
Why do not you know that you will die...

525
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,993
But the man never thinks
death?

526
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,381
When he is old and scared...

527
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,741
I, never thought the
death all these years...

528
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,429
All these years...

529
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,429
All these years...

530
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,701
And I'm only 35 years old!

531
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,500
Hello?

532
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,429
I am the Robert.

533
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,469
Robert, my love! It is not possible!
Like Magic!

534
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,975
I hear your voice and see
the same time!

535
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,500
Good!

536
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,265
As if you're beside me!
But, what your voice is?

537
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,313
Nothing... I'm just a cold...

538
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,014
I forgot to tell you. He will
come get me the Adrea...

539
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,975
You're going on a journey for a few days...
not to mind, right?

540
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,129
Yes, Helene, mind!
We have to leave!

541
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,952
Well, why not?

542
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,837
Why turn back...
Tomorrow!

543
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,975
I thought to tell you before
write the official report.

544
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,680
Thanks.

545
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,975
There is something strange, which
I can not understand...

546
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,500
What?

547
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,975
Recognize the voice?
Is the voice of the killer?

548
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,500
Yes!

549
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,993
Are you sure you always
he telephoned?

550
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,224
Yes, I believe so.

551
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,975
It is the voice of a very old man
man.

552
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,565
No, do not do wrong!

553
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,975
We sometimes test.
The result was the same.

554
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,748
How?

555
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,975
The first witness said
that was 30 years old...

556
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,565
Histology...

557
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,975
...
pieces of skin from the clutches of the victim...

558
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,565
... showed she was 50.

559
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,878
Now tell me that the voice
corresponds to a very old man man!

560
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,975
And all these
a few months!

561
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,333
One case only...
is a rare disease...

562
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,381
Her name
early age, or progireia.

563
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,857
A few things I know about this disease.

564
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,701
Usually affects children.

565
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,837
But it is very rare.

566
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,975
Sometimes contest
and adults...

567
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,313
... but at least
visible forms.

568
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,975
Years ago I met a man who had
infected...

569
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,565
He was 40 and looked 70!

570
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,401
We only show! The body of
actually was 70 years old!

571
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,293
See! Here are...

572
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,952
"Progireia..."

573
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,789
"... or Syndrome Hutchison
and Gilford."

574
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,061
Are the two scientists who discovered
!

575
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,898
I read these names hundreds
times in calendar Pesenti...

576
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,218
Robert Hutchinson Gilford...
Medical Conference in Paris...

577
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,975
We felt that was the name
a scientist...

578
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,975
... You epeirne
part in the conference...

579
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,837
and not dealt another.

580
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,653
Well, the Hutchison
not say the Robert!

581
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,544
I know!

582
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,946
The Robert was the name of someone
patient in the calendar...

583
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,810
Someone called Robert 
had contracted the disease...

584
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,565
Robert Ntoministi!

585
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,544
Robert!

586
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,884
Can I get in?

587
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,429
Robert sent me.

588
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,898
I know yesterday called from New York. 
He said he would come tonight...

589
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,544
Well...

590
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,653
- Today coming.
- Robert came.

591
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,993
Well, I came here because
I have to tell you something.

592
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,224
Nothing happened?

593
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,748
No, no...

594
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,129
Nothing will separate you
by Robert anymore!

595
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,224
Why take long then?

596
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,701
Excuse me a moment.

597
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,224
Please, sit.

598
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,837
I'll bring something to drink.

599
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,109
How did you know where I hide the whiskey?

600
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,517
, Robert has
secrets from me!

601
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,952
I see it!

602
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,816
Who are you?

603
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,381
You captured this photo...

604
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,449
It was the party of a mutual friend
...

605
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,020
How telling him?

606
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,769
About two years ago...

607
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,061
Before
know well and love...

608
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,857
Already I was in love with Robert then!

609
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,857
And from the way he
looks at the lens...

610
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,673
... I would say that he too had
in love ever since.

611
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,925
You have almost the same
voice of Robert!

612
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,653
And the same eyes...
The same look...

613
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,857
"The eyes have
a special glow!"

614
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,952
So you say...

615
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,333
There have changed my eyes...
The same is!

616
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,088
Well, what are you talking about?

617
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,313
I am, Helene!
I'm Robert!

618
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,925
No, you are not the Robert...
You're old...

619
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,653
Difficult to understand...
I know...

620
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,993
Well, I... I have this weird
illness.

621
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,565
Within months...

622
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,497
... ended up with that!

623
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,680
Illness?

624
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,041
I would like to explain to you, but...

625
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,381
Is there anything I need to do...

626
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,680
baby...

627
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,816
My Baby?

628
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,816
Our baby!

629
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,517
I can not allow
be born...

630
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,429
I do not understand?

631
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,769
It has the same blood as me!

632
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,748
Look at me!

633
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,769
You may be like me!

634
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,381
Unable
talking seriously!

635
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,001
My baby!

636
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,361
Nightmare is!

637
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,041
You can not be the Robert!

638
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,041
I can not wait, Helene...

639
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,041
A month is a long time!

640
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,313
It's too much
for me now...

641
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,816
I...

642
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,973
I can not wait any longer...

643
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,721
Even
one months is a long time!

644
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,680
Dying...

645
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,401
I can not wait to
born our child...

646
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,401
And then will be to convince
to kill...

647
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,952
I do not have time!

648
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,565
I have to do this!

649
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,500
Helene!

650
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,748
Are you okay?

651
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,748
In mattered?

652
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,156
Datti, finally!

653
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,469
I did everything to
make me stop...

654
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,633
But, how to understand?

655
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,088
Finished now...

656
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,857
is the most cruel joke
God...

657
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,837
... and He did it to me...
