Huh, what's so interesting at the Purdue place?

370
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,740

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,380
Oh, uh

373
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,240
Something happening over there

374
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,860
I'm calling the police

375
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,420

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,920
Yeah, what your gonna do,
just bum around the country?

382
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,660
Well, guess to find something that has meaning to me.

383
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,680
and go after it.

384
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,680
That can take the rest of your life.

385
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,980
Yeah, I guess it can.

386
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,080

387
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,620
one thing I got, is patience

388
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,200
You can't wait for ever

389
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,860
Maybe not.

390
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
But till I figure out what I want

391
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,680
I don't have any way to go after it.

392
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,880
How about you?

393
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,880

Well, what's wrong with that?

404

I just didn't think your the kind of girl who
take advantage of the situation like this

555
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,960
I'm sorry uncle Carl

556
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,160

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,060
Well, it doesn't matter

563
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,140
Honey?

564
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,000
I have neighbors here, a position in the community

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,680

574
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,920

576
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,000

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,140
Come on

580
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,580
What a drag!

581
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,060
There goes all whole summer,
It's not fair

582
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,300
Yeah, He sure didn't look like an old Fuddy daddy.

583
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,140
The fact is, he's kind a cute

584
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,600
Really?

585
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,220
I'll bet if he got to know us

586
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,280
He wouldn't be so mean

587
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,820
Ducky, That's it.

588
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,940
We gonna know uncle Carl, real friendly like you know!

589
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,300
I think we can change his mind!

590
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,080
Wait a minute, wait a minute
let me get my bearings

591
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,580

00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,640
You know what is in that direction
Idiot!

593
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,060

594
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,460
Ah Ha!

599
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,080
I can say this for you!

00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,700
You got balls, like me.

601
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,160
I don't play with mine all the time.

602
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,340
Oh, Smart guy, huh?

603
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,660

We got you cold and you gonna pay

605
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,560
Huh, I wouldn't be surprised if they
lock you away for life, for this one.

606
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,300
But Captain

607
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,600
Yeah, there a lot of smart guys like you, out there.

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,000
You mean He....

00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,380
Get them out of here!

625
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,520
Mind if I come in?

626
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,620

627
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,860

Glad to meet you, I'm Sarah's Uncle, Carl Purdue

631
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,120
Glad I meet you

632
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,180
Well, if you rather be alone

633
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,660
I got something to do

634
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,940
No that's alright

635
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
Sure it"s hot in here,
Isn't it?

636
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,980
That's the whole idea.

637
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,640
You ever heard of a cold sauna?

638
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
No

639
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,420
I hope you blame Sarah too much
for the parting going on.

640
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,640
I mean it really grew.

641
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,240
I guess it's kinda out of hand now

642
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,600
She should now better,
than to let it happen

643
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,680
She should have

644
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,140
May I

645
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,140
There's nothing like.... cold water.
When you really hot

646
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
No, there's nothing like it.

647
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,300
Feel so good to sweat

648
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,460
How old are you?

649
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,140
Huh?

650
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,940
I said, How old are you?

651
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,440
Oh, well, I'm older than Sarah

652
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,320
I'm old enough to know better

653
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,680
Isn't that what they say?

654
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,240
That's what they say about me.

655
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,340
Oh, your not so old.

656
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,780
You know it's hot in here.

657
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,420
Oh, I'm really sweating now.

658
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,800
Too hot?

659
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Oh, no, I love it.

660
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,600
Okay

661
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,500
You look upset.

662
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,020
Bad bay at the office?

663
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,840
The worst

664
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,380
Let me give you a back rub.

665
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,380
No, please no, thank you.

666
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,640
I'm only trying to help.

667
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,240
What I need is a drink.

668
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,200
Okay, I get you one.

669
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,240
No no, besides whir all out

No, thanks I'm trying to quite.

672
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,720
These aren't cigarettes, they don't kill you.

673
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,000

Well all be, No I don't mess with that.

00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,880
I thought that you where cooler than that.

You did huh?

679
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,640

Well, can't let down a lady.

681
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,200
Give it up

682
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,500
Sure listen up.

683
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,120
- Well alright

684
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,080
-Well alright
- nothing would go wrong.

685
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,760
Now take a deep breath.

686
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,780
Are we doing here

687
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,780
Hold it in.

688
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,300
Deeper, that's it

689
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,740
That's it

690
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,140
Why Ginger?

691
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,000
Is he dead?

692
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,980
We better call the cops, Where's the phone book?

693
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,200
You are the cops!

694
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,720
No, He's not dead

695
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,540
He just fell asleep

696
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,320
He works a little to hard, I give him a little grass

697
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,620
So he's in dreamland

You would like it if you tried it.

705
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,400
I could show you how.

706
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,840
Yeah, I'll bet you could.

707
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,120
And you can teach me how to play the guitar.

708
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,520
I could probably show you a few things.

709
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,100
I always wanted to learn.

710
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,980

My mouth feels like the
army marched trough it.

746
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,180
We got to get these people out of here.

747
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,340
This is a zoo

748
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,420
Just the zoo

749
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240

I don't know how people can get sea sick?

791
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,240
The ocean is so romantic

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,860
Up and down

799
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,620

817
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,620

I really don't know how to repay you.

820
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,160

821
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,440
No, don't put your self down like that uncle Carl
your a wonderful guy.

822
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,760
It's to bad we had to screw things up, partying and everything

823
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,200
We didn't know you where against them.

824
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
I'm not against parties.

825
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,520
I give them all the time.

826
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,160
Maybe you'll give us a going away party!

827
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,100
Ducky, the man wants us out.

828
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,600
No party

829
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,680
I wouldn't say that.

830
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,540
You mean we can have a party?

01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,580
It isn't?

911
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,200
It is?

912
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,960
It is just a little weed.

913
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,780
Well maybe not such a little.

914
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,840
How about 6 trash bags full.

01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,660

Oh, Come on Sarah wake up,

921
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,200
Just because you don't wanna have fun, doesn't mean you have to spoil it for everyone else.

922
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,440
Why is everyone always on my case?

923
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,340
I don't mean to be mean, Sarah!

924
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,400
But just look at your self?

925
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,540
You don't want to have any fun.

926
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,800
Your a 50 year old teenager

927
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,720
You where kinda hard on her!

928
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,440

01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,440
Come on here, blue eyes.

935
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,120
Oh, well go!

936

01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,040
I'm Me!

949
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,240
50 year old teenager about to loosen up,
and enjoy life.

950
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,800
That's not you!

951
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,800
Ow, yes it is.

952
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,460
I'm gonna find out what I've been missing all the time.

953
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,640
Sarah, you haven't been missing anything.

954
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,900
Everyone around here seems to think I have been

955
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,100
What everybody else think doesn't matter.

956
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,300
Sarah, listen?

957
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,300

Oh, come on uncle Carl, you liked it last night!

Well I have to admit..

962
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,660
I haven't slept like that

963
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,240
Since I was a kid

964
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,400
