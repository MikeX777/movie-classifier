1
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,934
Interior Pedro's house, day.

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,131
The house is quiet.

3
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,538
It's 3 p.m.

4
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,932
Pedro, the IandIord, is at his work.

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,536
But his Latin American
wife, Margarita,

6
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,608
is in the room of NabiI,
their young Turkish Iodger.

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,899
As they are eating each other's face,

8
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,411
NabiI gives Margarita
what Pedro cannot.

9
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,053
Margarita shouts out NabiI's name,

10
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,535
asking for more and more.

11
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,609
But just as she gets a cIimax,
the door swings open.

12
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,491
Pedro, the husband, has returned
from his work to surprise them.

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,453
Pedro waves his gun.

14
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,732
Margarita shouts:
''No, Pedro, it's not what you think!''

15
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,137
But with a viIIain angry smiIe,
Pedro puIIs the trigger.

16
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,609
Ali!

17
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,609
Ali!

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,289
Ali!

19
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,979
Okay, okay.

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,976
-Shut up. This is London, not Tunisia.
-You're bloody late!

21
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,738
Edgware Road, here we come!

22
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,890
What's the matter with you?
Are you blind?

23
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,456
-lt's not my fault, he was drunk.
-You'll pay forthis.

24
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,891
Naief, don't be so hard on him,
l'll pay for it.

25
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,419
Just for Madam Vivienne then.

26
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,253
Do it once more and you're out!

27
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,769
Bastard.

28
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,415
-Thanks.
-l have to go now.

29
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,498
Martin is coming back
from Malaysia in an hour.

30
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,409
l'll see you on Thursday.
Don't forget your stick.

31
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,894
How could l?

32
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,818
Mama, l can't come
back to Egypt now.

33
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,012
l have a good job
and a lovely house.

34
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,532
What shall l tell your cousin?
The girl can't wait any longer.

35
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,937
Good, now she
can marry someone else.

36
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,498
Ali, do you know how much
money you will lose? You are mad.

37
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,058
This marriage was your idea.
Tell her anything you want.

38
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,298
You are just like your father was.

39
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,775
You will be a failure.

40
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,450
-AIi, it's your sister EIham.
-Hi, EIham.

41
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,450
When you come home, bring me
a dress from Marks&Spencer.

42
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,974
Pedro. What are you doing?
What's happening?

43
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,692
You stupid ass!

44
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,379
Shut up, woman!

45
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,491
You wrote in your shit story...

46
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,455
that you have seen my wife
screw this fucking Turkish bastard!

47
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,492
l made it up. lt's a story, fantasy.

48
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,611
ln my head. Okay?

49
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,970
Margarita will never
do something like that.

50
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,653
She loves you, man.

51
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,500
He's right. l love you, Pedro!

52
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,539
All right.

53
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,493
So what the hell
happened to my room?

54
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,578
lt's not your room any more, pervert!

55
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,294
Your shitty stuff is all here! Get out!

56
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,333
lt's 5 o'clock in
the morning. Where l go?

57
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,295
-No my problem. Out!
-Give me my 80 pounds deposit.

58
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,970
Get out or l'll blow up
your fucking fish!

59
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,535
You hear me? Get out! Now!

60
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,738
Hey, stop! Hey, stop, stop!

61
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,969
Shit.

62
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,616
This happen when the
man will not give up his dreams.

63
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,368
How many times you've
been kicked out?

64
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,298
Don't count.

65
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,971
Forget this writing
shit and get a real life.

66
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,297
Start Halal meat shop
ortaxi like everyone else.

67
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,457
l don't wanna be like
everyone else, Ahmed.

68
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,573
Writing is my real life
and l know l can make it here.

69
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,374
Bullshit.
You're a bloody foreigner.

70
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,220
No chance for you
here without a British passport.

71
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,617
The White marriage is the solution.

72
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,496
Here, pick one.

73
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,930
From where you get all these?
A telephone box?

74
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,299
They are my clients.

75
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,969
l'm opening an agency
for White marriages.

76
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,210
-You must be joking.
-No, l'm not.

77
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,730
You know how many
foreigners without visa...

78
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,578
there are in this country?

79
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,976
l will make a fortune.

80
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,890
Sasha, very nice and cheap.

81
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,855
-She charge only 5.000 pounds.
-Oh, shit! 5.000 pounds?

82
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,530
l can't make this money
even if l save forten years.

83
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,890
Do you have a blonde one?

84
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,491
Blondes are
more expensive, smart-arse.

85
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,614
Number 52?

86
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,935
Yes.

87
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,094
Thank you.

88
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,251
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

89
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,019
That's all right, madam.

90
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,652
You're Egyptian.

91
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,539
Yes.

92
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,215
-May l touch your face?
-Sorry?

93
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,058
May l touch your face?

94
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,531
Yeah, why not. Go ahead.

95
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,295
Oh, no.

96
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,252
That's my stop.
l have to go.

97
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,691
Your name, please?
No, stay. l must talk to you.

98
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,215
Madam, please.

99
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,173
l have spent a lot of money
on my education here.

100
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,136
All l'm asking for is 6 months
to see if l can get work as a writer.

101
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,094
l must say, Mr Radwan, for a writer,

102
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,690
your grasp of the English
language is poor frankly.

103
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,939
Please.

104
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,495
Just 6 months.

105
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,179
No.

106
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,416
You must leave the country
within 12 weeks time.

107
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,251
Under no circumstances should
you seek paid employment.

108
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,893
ls that clear?

109
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,138
No work.

110
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,049
Cut, cut.

111
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,854
Very good. Very good, guys.

112
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,018
Ten minutes
while we change the reels.

113
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,252
Mr Paul, can you give me
the money forthis session up front?

114
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,374
-Ali, you know the system.
-Yes, but l need this money urgently.

115
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,651
The answer's no. Okay?

116
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,695
Can l ask you another favour?

117
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,096
Can you give this script to the
American producer when he comes?

118
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,699
Ali, l'm not your bloody agent.

119
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,254
This is the third script
you've given me this month.

120
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,737
This one is different.
lt's full of action, sex. He will love it.

121
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,853
You may well have written
'Pulp Fiction 2' for all l know,

122
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,654
but this guy
is not gonna be interested...

123
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,010
in an unknown writer like you. Okay?

124
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,494
Hey, look.

125
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,170
Why don't you stick to what
you can do really well. Okay?

126
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,771
Just let the music
swim through your body.

127
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,932
Okay. Don't force the movement.

128
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,176
Swim. Swim.

129
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,735
Good.

130
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,818
Sing! Sing! Sing Arabic to me!

131
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,097
-Vivienne.
-Yes?

132
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,769
Can l borrow some money from you?

133
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,449
How much?

134
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,212
5.000 pounds.

135
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,732
Are you crazy or what?
l don't have this kind of money.

136
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,533
Why do you want it?

137
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,811
To get a White marriage.

138
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,656
So l lend you money
for your White wedding?

139
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,134
How romantic.

140
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,253
No, it's not
a real marriage. lt's just fake.

141
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,208
That's the only way
l can stay in this country.

142
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,138
l have only eleven weeks left.

143
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,457
Well, don't worry,
nothing will happen to you.

144
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,335
There are thousands of people
without a visa in this country.

145
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,850
They won't catch you,
mon cheri.

146
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,215
lt's getting late now.

147
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,650
Your money forthe lesson.

148
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,453
You deserve it.

149
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,015
And this is the number
of my friend, Mark.

150
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,656
He's an artist l represent.
Looking for Arab models.

151
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,329
-Why don't you give him a call?
-l will.

152
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,531
Better go now, mon cheri.

153
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,457
A script writer?

154
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,977
-Anything l've seen?
-l didn't have any luck yet.

155
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,093
But, l do voice over and
l teach belly dancing.

156
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,369
So l heard.

157
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,536
l've never come across
a male belly dancer before.

158
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,573
ls it common?

159
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,054
Some men do.

160
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,898
-Do they?
-Yes.

161
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,740
l'm sure you're terribly good at it.

162
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,217
Could you stand
in front of the desert?

163
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,138
Can you look to the right?

164
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,698
Put your sword up.

165
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,774
Just down a tiny bit. Perfect.

166
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,254
Hold it.

167
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,656
The camera adores you.

168
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,895
Does it?

169
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,535
Yeah, you're perfect.

170
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,818
Am l?

171
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,337
Vivienne tells me
you need somewhere to sleep.

172
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,409
Yeah, that's true.

173
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,493
This guy's a faggot.
He'll be after your dick.

174
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,852
Vivienne will not tell me to go
if he's this kind of man.

175
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,899
A woman who
can screw another man...

176
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,171
on her husband's floor
can do anything.

177
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,530
Listen, l'm tired of your snoring.

178
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,254
He's offering me 100 pounds
each week for modelling.

179
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,371
And a free room. How can l refuse?

180
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,299
l need to save money
for your White marriage great idea.

181
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,735
Okay, go.

182
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,296
But don't come to me
and cry when he gets your arse.

183
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,576
l love the decor.

184
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,818
lt's very... filmy.

185
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,415
-Here's your front door key.
-Thank you.

186
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,975
Make yourself at home. l'm off out.

187
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,014
lf the phone rings,
can you let it go to the machine?

188
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,697
-Unless it's for you. Obviously.
-All right, thank you.

189
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,016
Max, young and IoneIy.

190
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,450
Looking for reaI Iove.

191
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,573
You must be oId and boId.

192
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,179
Daddy type.

193
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,649
Dirty underpants for saIe.

194
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,812
Hi, it's Mark. Leave a message. Bye.

195
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,333
Mark, it's George. We met in
''Heaven''Iast week, remember?

196
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,854
Mark is gay.

197
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,974
-ls that a problem for you?
-Of course! l'm living with him.

198
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,457
And if he get excited
and try to do something with me?

199
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,208
Don't be silly,
he knows you're not gay.

200
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,288
Anyway, l thought
writers like new experiences.

201
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,140
-Hello, hello.
-Hi, Vivienne.

202
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,415
Tight bum.

203
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,213
Fancy a drink?

204
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,457
As the night faIIs,

205
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,493
Mark gets ready
for a new adventure.

206
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,489
He goes to ''The Rough AngeIs''cIub.

207
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,532
It is fiIIed with men.

208
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,937
He steps inside
with a big inviting smiIe.

209
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,175
Shit!

210
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,415
Ali!

211
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,049
Ali!

212
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,935
-What is happening?
-Sorry, l burnt my sausage.

213
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,534
-Why are you writing in here?
-My light-bulb blew up and...

214
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,051
-l'd better get you another one.
-Thank you, Mark.

215
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,136
Have we met before?

216
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,338
No, we never met.

217
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,889
l've seen your face somewhere.

218
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,374
Anyway, l'm Dick from Malta.

219
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,453
Ali from Egypt.

220
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,571
l've been to Egypt many times.

221
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,930
Always have a wonderful time.

222
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,332
l'm so sorry about that.

223
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,094
LoneIy Mark
drags Dick to his room.

224
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,053
Dick faIIs on him
with an irresistibIe smiIe.

225
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,217
As their forbidden Iove goes on,

226
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,936
their bodies melt together
on the big sweaty bed.

227
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,536
But before they reach the cIimax,

228
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,857
the rent boy, Dick,
hits Mark with the bedside Iamp.

229
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,093
Mark's face get white,
the body stop moving.

230
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,496
And suddenIy... siIent.

231
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,894
Yep?

232
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,734
l heard somebody
screaming. Are you all right?

233
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,499
l'm absolutely fine.

234
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,893
What this for?

235
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,899
You've got bags under your eyes.

236
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,375
-l haven't slept all night!
-You'll get used to it.

237
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,298
Get used to what?

238
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,574
Your new bed.

239
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,569
Look up.

240
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,859
Ali, try and look more tragic.

241
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,778
l wanna see some pain.

242
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,249
Beautiful.

243
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,538
Somebody wants
to marry your reserve fake wife.

244
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,937
l told him to wait.
How much have you saved?

245
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,172
lf we get paid today,

246
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,893
150 pounds.

247
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,938
Fuck! 150 quid?

248
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,410
l can't get you a dead
pigeon for bloody 150 quid.

249
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,497
You need to move fast.

250
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,691
How much time left on your visa?

251
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,137
-About ten weeks.
-You're in real trouble.

252
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,332
Ask this fairy you live with
to lend you some money.

253
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,690
He's a photographer,
he must be loaded.

254
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,935
Mark?

255
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,178
l wouldn't ask him
for a glass of water.

256
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,415
Maybe, you just need
to screw him first before you ask.

257
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,135
Do you think l am a bloody gigolo?

258
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,777
You said it, not me.

259
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,009
Where is this bloody script?

260
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,298
Jesus Christ!

261
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,652
No, no, wait, wait.
He's just my lodger.

262
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,250
-Your lodger?
-Yeah.

263
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,897
l'm not really into that at all.

264
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,809
Sean!

265
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,852
Sean, wait!

266
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,368
Sean!

267
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,292
What are you doing in my bedroom?

268
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,093
l...

269
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,055
Looking forthe murder weapon?

270
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,853
The murder weapon?

271
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,734
A bedside lamp,
if l remember rightly.

272
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,215
That's my script!

273
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,618
The one starring Mark,
the promiscuous gay painter.

274
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,414
Attacked by Dick from Malta,

275
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,851
and bludgeoned to death
by a bedside fucking lamp!

276
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,497
l take my material from
what's happening around me.

277
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,010
That doesn't mean
l'm writing about you personally.

278
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,337
-Means you are sick.
-What about you?

279
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,850
Every night you come
home with a different fella.

280
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,496
One night a crazy guy
will beat you or maybe kill you.

281
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,739
-You have no right to...
-The police will think it's me!

282
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,099
Why you laugh?

283
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,733
l'm serious.

284
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,411
Stupidly for a second l thought
you were worried about me.

285
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,053
Listen to me.

286
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,138
l live my life the way l choose.

287
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,453
Now, if you don't like that,
fuck off out of here.

288
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,613
Tough shit, l've lost the key.

289
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,933
When?

290
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,775
-Oh, my God!
-Your key.

291
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,414
Why didn't you tell me she was ill?

292
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,534
Come on, mate.

293
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,179
So l was right.
He tried to get your arse.

294
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,736
No, clever Dick,
he didn't like what l wrote about him.

295
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,250
l can't believe you.
When will you learn?

296
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,656
Ahmed, l'm tired, l'm wet.

297
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,771
l don't want to hear
your boring speeches.

298
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,379
Can l stay tonight or not?

299
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,938
Ali, you know you are welcome,
but as you can see l have this chick.

300
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,933
You want to join us?

301
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,610
-She's a real hot one.
-No, thank you. l had my dinner.

302
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,169
Vivienne!

303
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,209
Vivienne!

304
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,419
Can l come in?

305
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,815
Wait, wait. l'll be back.

306
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,212
What the hell are you doing?

307
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,411
Martin's upstairs.

308
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,816
Your friend Mark chucked me out.

309
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,977
-You did something wrong.
-No, l did nothing!

310
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,775
-l'll talk to him.
-No, don't. l will never go back.

311
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,415
Yeah, l'm coming.

312
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,258
You have to go, come.

313
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,771
-Please, l'm so cold.
-Go.

314
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,449
Vivienne.

315
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,970
Can you keep my fish?

316
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,768
Yes, of course.

317
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,415
Darling?

318
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,736
ls everything all right?

319
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,214
Be good. Ciao.

320
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,330
You were picked up
at two o'clock this morning...

321
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,053
with this so-called luggage.

322
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,410
You're wearing a handcuff!

323
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,418
What were you doing?

324
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,373
l have told you.

325
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,131
l was visiting some friends and they
gave me the handcuff for good luck.

326
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,850
Tell us your friends' names
and we'll call 'em.

327
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,095
l can't.

328
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,449
Why not?

329
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,135
Because l can't.

330
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,688
This is really very funny.

331
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,571
Student visa.
You're not working, are you?

332
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,772
Me? No.
l'm just enjoying London.

333
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,177
Where are you staying
till this visa runs out?

334
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,610
l was renting a room
from a guy called Mark.

335
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,892
You mean ''Mark''?
The guy in this story?

336
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,935
Yes.

337
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,817
lt's his stuff.
He's been staying with me.

338
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,819
We had an argument and he left.

339
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,453
Sign this, sir,
it'll bring matters to a close.

340
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,450
Your driving licence.
You're free to go now, sir.

341
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,578
Good night, Mark.

342
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,619
What about me?

343
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,972
Wait, l've got
to find out what Dick was up to.

344
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,089
Ali.

345
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,615
Get in.

346
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,215
Come on.

347
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,689
Thank you.

348
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,408
Thank you, too.

349
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,410
Now the whole police station knows
what Mark gets up to in his bedroom.

350
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,655
Mark,

351
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,737
l'm really sorry.

352
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,659
l shouldn't have gone in your room.

353
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,859
l shouldn't have read
your bloody script.

354
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,573
-l'm sorry about what l said.
-l know what you've said.

355
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,815
Fuck!

356
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,014
You wanker!

357
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,291
Are you all right?

358
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,533
No, l'm not.

359
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,409
My mother died tonight.

360
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,530
She's the one l talk to.

361
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,569
My father,

362
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,216
he just hates the fact
that l'm his only son,

363
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,613
and l'm gay.

364
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,138
He looks at me like he's thinking...

365
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,775
''What a sad waste of a man''.

366
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,928
l am dreading this funeral.

367
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,938
Oh God.

368
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,937
Why don't you take
a friend with you?

369
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,737
Dick from Malta?

370
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,018
Those men...

371
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,409
they are not friends, Ali.

372
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,010
Shall l come with you?

373
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,378
What, you?

374
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,888
Yeah. Me.

375
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,935
What?

376
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,378
We have entrusted our sister
Mary to God's merciful keeping.

377
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,128
We now commit
her body to the ground.

378
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,973
Earth to earth,

379
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,739
ashes to ashes,

380
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,658
dust to dust.

381
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,451
ln sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

382
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,254
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

383
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,449
who died, was buried
and rose again for us.

384
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,372
To him be the Glory,
forever and ever, amen.

385
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,055
Amen.

386
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,937
Cucumber or egg?

387
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,608
Thank you.

388
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,618
Cucumber, thank you.

389
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,012
-Would you like a cup of tea?
-All right.

390
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,530
Does you father know?

391
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,014
Know what?

392
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,256
That you and Mark...

393
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,053
are together.

394
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,729
Oh, no.

395
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,779
My father died a long time ago.

396
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,216
Good for him.

397
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,492
For rheumatism.

398
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,296
Anyway, you seem
like a decent sort of chap.

399
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,413
Pity that Mark and l never
understood each other.

400
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,692
l shall be going my self soon, too.

401
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,209
Look after him, would you?

402
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,411
He's a fine man.

403
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,573
He always did like Eastern culture.

404
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,655
Tea?

405
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,169
Thank you.

406
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,299
What was he talking about?

407
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,094
You like Eastern culture?

408
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,736
lt was nice to meet you.

409
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,612
And you, Ali.

410
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,219
Drive safely.

411
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,568
l will.

412
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,368
There we are.

413
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,176
Ah, yes. Thank you.

414
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,532
l feel free now.

415
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,415
Mark.

416
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,816
l didn't tell you before.

417
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,489
My visa is finishing in eight weeks.

418
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,170
l can't stay here
unless l do White marriage,

419
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,813
and l don't have the money.

420
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,534
-White what?
-A fake marriage.

421
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,209
You can't do that, it's deeply illegal.

422
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,819
l know, l know.

423
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,174
But what can l do?

424
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,769
l'm not gonna let you. This is absurd.

425
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,769
You'll end up in prison.
There must be another way.

426
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,258
He's asking
for another six months.

427
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,417
lt's not that big deal.

428
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,260
Sir, this country
is not a charity home.

429
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,734
Underthe present Act,

430
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,695
Mr. Radwan has no right
to demand an extension to his visa,

431
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,777
or seek employment.

432
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,494
May l ask you how
you are supporting yourself?

433
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,055
His father is terribly rich.

434
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,209
-He send me money every week.
-And sometimes twice a week.

435
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,455
Yeah.

436
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,891
This man's whole
future depends upon you.

437
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,693
Give him six months.

438
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,254
Who are you?

439
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,770
His friend.

440
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,175
Yes.

441
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,449
The White marriage
is starting to look damn attractive.

442
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,930
l need 5.000 pounds to do it.

443
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,778
l only have 500.

444
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,454
Maybe Linda could cut a deal.

445
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,413
-She's always broke.
-Linda?

446
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,329
Yeah, you know,
the model in the photographs.

447
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,174
Bloody hell! That Marylin woman?

448
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,415
Yeah.

449
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,017
Yes. Phone her now.

450
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,653
-l will.
-Yes!

451
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,289
l will.

452
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,655
Engaged.

453
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,652
Try this.

454
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,575
lt's fully charged.

455
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,012
WhiIe tearing off a game of goIf,

456
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,089
I may make a pIay forthe caddie,

457
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,259

00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,895

459
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,570
'cos my heart beIongs to daddy.

460
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,449
If I invite a boy some night,

461
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,815
to dine on my fine finnan haddy...

462
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,174
Hi, come on in. Lovely show.

463
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,418
-Does Linda work here?
-Linda?

464
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,179
The new blonde.

00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:54,056

She's on stage.

471
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,579
Wait here.

472
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,377
WhiIe tearing off a game of goIf,

473
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,333

480
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,979

weII.

487
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,730
You're the Egyptian
who wants to marry me?

488
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,217
Yeah. l mean,
that's not a real marriage.

489
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,051
-lt's just fake to get my visa.
-Mark tells me you're a screenwriter.

490
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,776
-Anything famous?
-l haven't been lucky yet.

491
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,893
-This'll bring you luck.
-l hope so.

492
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,617
My faith healer has one.
She's just crazy about Egypt.

493
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,449
-She talks about it all the time.
-Really?

494
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,697
So, l've been given it lots of thought,

495
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,251
and l've decided.

496
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,615
-l can help you.
-Yes, great! Thank you!

497
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,811
l mean, thank you.

498
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,818
But you sound a little bit American.

499
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,694
That's because l'm American, silly.

500
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,894
My mother is from New York
and my father is from England,

501
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,057
so l have a British passport.

502
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,570
l can do it for 3.000 pounds.

503
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,848
3.000!

504
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,974
-Yeah. Something the matter?
-Oh, no.

505
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,212
l have only 500.

506
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,573
500?

507
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,572
l can't marry you forthat.

508
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,533
That's only what l've saved.

509
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,539
l give you
the rest as soon as l can.

510
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,697
Please, don't say no.

511
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,375
Please.

512
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,098
Okay, l'll do it.

513
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,057
But no wedding bells
till l get the rest of it.

514
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,819
l understand.

515
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,292
And remember, this is just business.

516
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,248
Yeah, l know.

517
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,736
You're on now, Marilyn.

518
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,255
l'm coming, Tina. Okay.

519
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,533
Okay, l mean, thank you again.

520
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,449
Yes, yes!

521
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,617
She said yes!

522
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,377
She said yes!

523
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,539
She said yes!

524
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,415
Oh, man, can you believe it?
Me and Marilyn Monroe.

525
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,534
l just couldn't believe my ears...
She will marry me.

526
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,219
Okay, bastard.

527
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,100
You take my idea and not pay me.

528
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,338
How would you get
the money in 7 weeks?

529
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,896
l will work very hard
and save every penny.

530
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,539
And what about if you get caught?

531
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,172
Get caught? Why? You said it's safe.

532
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,453
l thought that, but yesterday,
the lmmigration bastards...

533
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,052
search my flat to prove
that my fake wife is living with me.

534
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,773
l'm afraid, Ali.

535
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,411
They could deport me
if they prove l make a fake marriage.

536
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,534
lt's your fault, Ahmed.
Offering your service to everyone.

537
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,812
Sometime
l wonder why we are doing this.

538
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,854
You can go back
to Tunisia and farm your father's land.

539
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,937
l wish l could, but how?

540
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,418
All my village will be waiting for
me to see how much money l made.

541
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,091
l told them l have a big villa,
two Mercedes, and three restaurants.

542
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,850
Three bloody restaurants!
How can l go now?

543
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,052
lt's marvellous exercise, l'm told.

544
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,299
-You're a very good dance teacher.
-Not really.

545
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,652
l'd love to see you,
but l travel all the time.

546
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,089
l tell you something, Ali.

547
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,896
Since Vivienne started the dance
workshop with you, she's become...

548
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,693
How shall l put it?

549
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,540
Even more lovely to come home to.

550
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,219
Merci, mon cheri.

551
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,451
Can you excuse me?

552
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,208
Very nice.

553
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,056
Let's look at that one.

554
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,298
That's a good one. Very well hung.

555
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,128
lsn't Fernando gorgeous?

556
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,772
He's just agreed
to be my next model.

557
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,619
Mark, l think l should move out.

558
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,619
We'll be really quiet, l promise.

559
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,495
No, that's not the reason, man.

560
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,819
l found out it's dangerous
not to live with my fake wife.

561
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,931
lf Linda has a room,

562
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,814
l think l should move there, no?

563
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,373
lf we get married,
we have to live together.

564
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,777
Just to convince
the lmmigration people.

565
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,776
-Like that film ''Green Card''?
-Yeah, something like that.

566
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,415
Can l get a couple of shots?

567
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,255
Thank you.

568
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,450
As a matter of fact, l've a very
nice room that's empty right now.

569
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,938
-Great! Can l move in?
-Yes, for 40 pounds a week.

570
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,134
lf we're going to get married,

571
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,934
l need the rest of the money soon.

572
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,053
Yes, l know. Very soon, l promise.

573
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,731
Good afternoon, sir.

574
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,138
Nice little room. Thanks, Linda.

575
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,296
Why you keep bothering me?

576
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,696
Linda, l love you, baby!

577
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,219
You're here.

578
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,138
l came this afternoon.
Are you all right?

579
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,138
l saw this man bothering you.

580
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,093
He's just some crazy fan
who's always following me.

581
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,850
But that's showbiz.

582
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,820
l bought some flowers for you.

583
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,692
That's so sweet.

584
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,450
-l hope it didn't cost you too much.
-Oh, no.

585
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,529
That's the rent forthe week.

586
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,048
Thanks. l'll get you a receipt.

587
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,976
So any news about
the rest of the money?

588
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,689
-l really need it fast, you know?
-l'm doing my best, l promise you.

589
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,215
Thank you.

590
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,218
Okay, goodnight.

591
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,574
Exterior MariIyn's flat, night.

592
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,012
Aziz sees a man trying to attack
his bIonde dream girl, MaryIin.

593
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,973
He rushes outside and beats him up.

594
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,537
The man runs away
and MariIyn hugs Aziz,

595
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,970
and gives him a Iong kiss.

596
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,975
Aziz is in a seven heaven.

597
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,411
Martin's away
in Bangladesh for a few days.

598
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,737
Come around tonight
and feed your little fish.

599
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,659
-She's missing you.
-l'm missing hertoo.

600
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,535
-l'm really feeling tired tonight and...
-Okay.

601
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,816
Have a nice rest then.

602
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,852
Ali! What are you doing here?

603
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,894
l finish early and l thought
we could share a cab to the flat.

604
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,775
-Maybe this fan follows you.
-That's so sweet.

605
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,736
-You don't have to worry about me.
-That's what a fake husband is for.

606
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,571
Do you have a dream, Linda?

607
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,249
Yes, to be a star.

608
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,613
To be famous.

609
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,210
Could you imagine what
it would be like to be loved forever...

610
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,219
and to always
be thought of as beautiful?

611
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,776
l'm sure you'll be a star.

612
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,370
You are very talented
and very pretty.

613
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,254
-You really think so?
-Yeah.

614
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,015
Gosh!

615
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,929
l've never been told l was pretty
before, even when l was little.

616
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,179
All little girls should be told
they're pretty, even if they're not.

617
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,770
You must have a dream too, Ali.

618
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,251
Mine is, get my visa,

619
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,053
my own place,

620
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,330
marry the girl l love,

621
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,172
and be a famous, rich screenwriter.

622
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,451
Have my name on the screen,

623
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,379
and go to Hollywood. That's all.

624
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,409
Wait.

625
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,129
Thank you.

626
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,695
Linda.

627
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,816
l want to tell you something.

628
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,055
Yes?

629
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,336
l'm writing a script about you.

630
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,137
A script about me?

631
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,014
Yeah. l mean,
it's not about you personally.

632
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,092
lt's based on your character.

633
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,935
And l hope you don't mind.

634
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,730
No, l don't mind at all.

635
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,248
A script about me?

636
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,258
This is wonderful.

637
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,176
And l hope to sell it quickly
and give you the rest of the money.

638
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,213
Yes. l'm having
a birthday party this Monday.

639
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,615
-Would you like to come?
-Yeah.

640
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,097
l could introduce you to a movie
director who might help you.

641
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,848
That's great.
l will be there, of course.

642
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,610
This could be like
you're Arthur and...

643
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,775
l'm Marilyn and maybe you could
write something like ''The Misfits''.

644
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,775
Or like ''Let's Make Love''.

645
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,016
Amanda. She sings
and dances, you know.

646
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,335
And l sing.

647
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,811
Suzy, swim. Swim more.

648
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,489
Yes, like that. Very good. Very good.

649
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,135
Yeah.

650
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,012
Maintenant, maintenant!

651
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,219
Okay, Ali. What's the matter?

652
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,373
Vivienne, listen.

653
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,491
Can we just be friends?

654
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,771
Are you fucking
that whore you live with?

655
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,857
No, l'm not and she's not a whore!

656
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,335
Sorry to insult you princess.

657
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,532
l just find it hard since
l met your husband, all right?

658
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,208
Come on, mon cheri,
he's got his own mistress too.

659
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,535
No!

660
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,334
Come on, you know l like you.

661
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,095
You're very special to me.

662
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,733
Yeah, l like you too.

663
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,738
But try to understand.

664
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,499
l feel like a gigolo.

665
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,058
And l just can't do it any more.

666
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,128
Suddenly you got a conscience?

667
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,016
-Maybe you should get one too.
-Go! Go then!

668
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,936
Happy birthday, Linda.

669
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,131
l bought this for you.

670
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,531
Oh, it's beautiful, Ali.

671
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,855
For good luck.

672
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,373
There's Sam.

673
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,936
He's the movie director.

674
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,578
Happy birthday.

675
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,771
You look gorgeous.

676
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,175
Thank you, Sam.

677
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,451
-You shouldn't have.
-My pleasure.

678
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,370
-This is Ali, the screenwriter.
-He's writing a script about you.

679
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,649
Hi.

680
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,579
This script sounds really interesting.

681
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,010
-We should meet up.
-Yeah.

682
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,972
Look, here's my mobile.

683
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,171
We could meet in 'Jerry's'.

684
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,928
-ls next Thursday cool?
-Yeah, very cool.

685
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,337
We're gonna have
a fabulous time working together.

686
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,975
Ali.

687
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,294
Good luck.

688
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,735
Ali.

689
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:20,857
l hate to say it but, gay films
were an '80s thing, done to death.

690
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,096
''My Nights with Mark'' is different.

691
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,531
lt's about the relationship between
a gay guy and a straight guy.

692
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,492
Like l say, done to death.

693
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,532
Where's your script about Linda?

694
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,251
l haven't finished it yet.

695
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,612
Look, Ali,
l like your writing, you know.

696
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,017
lt's strange, it's weird,
it breaks the rules,

697
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,894
but what about
something more personal?

698
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,250
What about
''Anthony and Cleopatra''?

699
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,571
Modern version, obviously.

700
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,096
Linda could play the lead.

701
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,409
Linda?

702
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,453
Yeah. l think
she'd make a great Cleopatra.

703
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,537
Like to have a go?

704
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,772
l will think about it.

705
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,971
l can get you 4.000.

706
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,973
4.000?

707
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,533
l will do it.

708
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,338
Leave Marilyn alone,
you black bastard!

709
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,292
She's mine. Mine!

710
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,650
She's my fiancee. l can't leave her.

711
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,374
She's your fucking fiancee?

712
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,015
Your fucking fiancee is she?

713
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,614
ls she?

714
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,250
Do you know his name?
He will not get away with this!

715
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,134
Don't talk like that.
He could have really hurt you.

716
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,058
l don't care!

717
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,616
Could you just
not talk about him any more?

718
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,619
lt's spoiling our wonderful news.

719
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,818
Ali, promise me,

720
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,651
promise me you'll write
the best script you ever wrote.

721
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,054
l promise you
l will write the best script ever.

722
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,455
Chef!

723
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,890
By the NiIe,
beneath the desert moon,

724
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,375
in the shadow
of the goIden pyramids,

725
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,448
Anthony, the victorious soIdier,
is reIaxing in the bath.

726
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,653
The door open wide and CIeopatra
appears in a Iong floaty nightie.

727
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,378
With food and wine.

728
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,537
She waIks into the water,

729
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,452
and kisses him passionateIy.

730
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,055
Well done, Ali. That's the one.

731
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,338
Apart from some tweaks
to the middle, of course.

732
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,180
l really cried
when she poisoned herself.

733
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,655
-lt's wonderful.
-Thank you.

734
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,455
-When do l get the money?
-Soon as we start filming.

735
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,890
First day of the shoot.

736
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,252
When l get the money
we must get married quickly.

737
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,452
My time is running out.
l have only 1 7 days left.

738
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,093
Yes, we'll do it, Ali.

739
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,371
But l need the money first.

740
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,455
You know, l always
wondered if l'd ever make it...

741
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,334
to the other side of the street.

742
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,895
Thank you, Ali
for making my dreams come true.

743
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,255
Hi, Lisa.

744
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,778
That's great.

745
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,971
Five minute break. Thank you.

746
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,809
Ali. Ali.

747
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,977
Congratulations.

748
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,775
The boys told me one of your scripts
is gonna be going into production.

749
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,328
Thank you, Mr Paul.

750
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,568
lf the producer needs
a dubbing supervisor,

751
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,895
will you give him my name?

752
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,454
Yes, of course.

753
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,576
Who's your director?
Do l know him?

754
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,254
Sam Smith.

755
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,338
Yeah, definitely rings a bell.

756
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,219
Well done.
l always knew you had it in you.

757
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,416
They film my script next week.

758
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,739
Your son's picture will be all over
the English newspapers.

759
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,136
God bless you, my son.

760
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,888
l always pray for you, Ali.

761
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,609
Listen, mama.

762
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,772
l'm getting married
to an English girl.

763
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,052
What did you say?
An English girl?

764
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,412
Don't get mad at me. l love her!

765
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,295
And you will like hertoo.

766
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,458
-Guess who she Iooks Iike.
-Who?

767
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,459
-MariIyn Monroe.
-Marilyn?

768
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,579
You look good.

769
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,893
Oh, he's here.

770
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,896
Hi. l'm Sam's assistant.

771
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,455
l've come to take you to the studio.

772
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,811
We can't take you with us.

773
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,135
What?

774
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,218
This is my first script to be filmed.
l have to go.

775
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,411
He's the screen writer.

776
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,019
And l'm supposed
to get paid today.

777
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,530
l'll have a word.
Maybe next week.

778
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,732
Better go or we'll fall
behind schedule.

779
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,971
Can you follow this car?

780
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,132
l knew there was a kissing scene,

781
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,369
but nobody said anything about
having sex with Anthony in a bath.

782
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,219
This is porn, Sam!

783
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,774
Real sex in films is coming back.

784
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,573
l promise you.

785
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,897
This is my first film.
Don't mess it up.

786
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,657
l can't. l can't do it.

787
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,092
No-one's ever heard of you.
This is your big break.

788
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,371
Even Marilyn started in porn.

789
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,934
Please, l'm begging you.

790
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,375
l don't think this is a good idea.

791
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,616
Get your hands of her, you bastard!

792
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,414
l can explain.

793
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,375
This is what you make me do,
what you say about my country?

794
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,888
ls this what you left me for?

795
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,811
Okay, just stop it!

796
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,099
Get off him!

797
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,612
-Who the fuck are you?
-l'm the writer, you bastard!

798
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,015
Gosh!

799
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,054
l thought it was my big break.

800
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,008
Me too.

801
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,697
Maybe Sam was right.

802
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,892
Maybe l should have
just gone through with it.

803
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,729
Linda. We must not let
that bastard get us down.

804
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,299
You are a good actress. Me and you.

805
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,011
We will do it, okay?

806
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,496
No. Ali.

807
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,335
Let's just be friends.

808
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,813
But l love you.

809
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,977
l can't hide it any more.

810
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,614
You do?

811
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,814
Yes.

812
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,410
Since the first time l saw you.

813
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,891
But you don't deserve me.

814
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,689
You deserve
a woman people respect.

815
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,732
But l do respect you.

816
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,855
No man's ever said that to me.

817
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,653
Because l love you.

818
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,933
You really do?

819
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,851
l wanna marry you.

820
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,298
l mean for real.

821
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,731
l want you to be my real wife.

822
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,809
You wanna marry me for real?

823
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,096
Yes, l do. l even told my mother.

824
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,889
l can't.

825
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,450
Did l say something wrong?

826
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,095
No.

827
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,698
l just...

828
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,452
l just wanna be
alone right now, please.

829
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,099
Could you go?

830
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,778
What's happening?

831
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,658
l can't marry you, Ali.

832
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,010
l'm already married.

833
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,858
What?

834
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,892
The crazy fan.

835
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,258
That's my husband.

836
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,692
l married him when l was nineteen.

837
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,257
l thought it was
a good idea at the time.

838
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,771
Then he started
getting really jealous with me.

839
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,579
lt got so bad...

840
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,057
that he cut someone
just fortalking to me.

841
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,332
So he got sent away
for a couple of years.

842
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:37,614
And then he left me some money
that l was supposed to take care...

843
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,015
and l took it.

844
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,972
l ran with it.

845
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,251
And he's been after me ever since.

846
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,293
And he won't divorce me
until l give him his money back.

847
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,378
That's why you agreed to marry me?

848
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,651
To give him my money?

849
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,496
But you could
never marry me in time.

850
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,736
And you always know this?

851
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,459
Are you all right?

852
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,619
l took 40 sleeping pills.

853
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,135
That was fucking rude.

854
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,614
Come on.

855
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,814
l still can't believe she's married.

856
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,408
Yesterday l have everything.

857
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,533
A beautiful wife, a film, a visa.

858
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,572
lt's all gone now.

859
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,411
l don't know what to do.

860
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,930
And l have less than two weeks.

861
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,609
Look,

862
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,088
l'll lend you the money
and you can pay me back...

863
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,495
whenever.

864
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,813
Thank you, Mark.
l will never forget your help.

865
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,819
Cut the Egyptian drama, please.

866
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,218
-How is she, miss?
-She'll survive.

867
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,974
Thank you.

868
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,010
Thank you, they're very pretty.

869
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,218
The doctor says
you can go home tomorrow.

870
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,975
Ali.

871
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,571
l'm not going home.

872
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,371
l'm going to stay
with a friend for a while.

873
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,332
l've decided...

874
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,578
that l just need to find Linda again.

875
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,295
You know?

876
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,132
l talked to my faith healer,

877
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,695
and she gave me this address,

878
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,129
where you can stay.

879
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,297
She has an empty
room in her house...

880
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,538
and she won't charge you anything.

881
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,130
l don't want another room.

882
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,612
l want you, Linda.

883
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:27,769
l love you.

884
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,376
Don't say that, Ali.

885
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:41,177
That wasn't me you loved.

886
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,010
I'm through with Iove,

887
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,939
I'II never faII again.

888
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,415
Said adieu to Iove,

889
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,055
don't ever caII again.

890
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:03,299
For I must have you or no-one.

891
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:09,935
And so I'm through with Iove.

892
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,936
I've Iocked my heart,

893
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,859
I'II keep my feeIings there.

894
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,015
I've stocked my heart,

895
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,416
with icy frigid air.

896
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:26,534
And I need to care for no-one.

897
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,529
Because I'm through with Iove.

898
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,654
Hello?

899
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,009
Hello?

900
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,099
Good evening.

901
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,255
You're Linda's friend.

902
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,132
Such a lively girl.

903
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,058
So full of dreams.

904
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,570
Let's hope she'll find her way.

905
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,253
We met before on the bus.

906
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,690
Do you remember?

907
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,131
You're very sad, aren't you?

908
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,059
l know what you've been through,

909
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,092
but time will heal it.

910
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,812
Oh good. You still have yours.

911
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,137
Welcome home, Ali.

912
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,733
-Would you like some cake?
-No.

913
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:45,093
l made some specially.
The way you like it. Come.

914
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:56,014
No, thank you. l've had enough.

915
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,772
You used to love cakes.

916
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,415
So, how is your writing going?

917
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,731
How did you know l'm a writer?

918
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,409
-Did Linda tell you that?
-Yes.

919
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,897
But let's just say
l know a lot about you anyway.

920
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,934
-l told you, that Marilyn...
-You shut up!

921
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,338
l really don't want to
talk about it any more.

922
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,775
My friend Mark
lent me 1.000 pounds.

923
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,450
So just take it
and get me a cheap fake bride.

924
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,617
l need to move fast now.

925
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,772
See l've told you, he is a good man.

926
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,177
And guess what, l saved a
beautiful Scottish bride for you.

927
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:55,657
-l give her a call now.
-Can't we use a local one?

928
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,177
From London?
For 1.000 fucking quid?

929
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,257
No way. Don't worry.

930
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,496
-HeIIo?
-HeIIo. Is this Susan MacdonaId?

931
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,374
-Aye.
-Hi, it's Ahmed, your agent.

932
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,298
-How are you?
-l'm fine.

933
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,174
Guess what l have for you?
A husband. Yes.

934
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,928
-Oh, reaIIy?
-He just sitting here with me.

935
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,892
-Is he handsome?
-Yes, yes.

936
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,217
-WouId you Iike to taIk to him?
-Okay, put him on.

937
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,691
-HeIIo?
-Hi, Susan.

938
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,857
Oh no, just black, thank you.

939
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:37,535
You used to have it with milk.

940
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,220
Why you talk to me
as if you have known me before?

941
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,252
l'm not surprised
you don't remember.

942
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,657
-lt's been a long time.
-What are you talking about?

943
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:49,655
Would you please tell
me what's going on?

944
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,460
ln 1935 when l was eight,

945
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:58,254
l moved with my family to Luxor.

946
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,895
My father was an Egyptologist.

947
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,536
We had a cook
in Luxor called Mahmoud.

948
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,209
His son was
two years olderthan me.

949
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,775
We used to play
together all the time.

950
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,178
This little boy grew up to be the
most handsome man in the world.

951
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,939
And very clever.

952
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,893
He wanted to read English
at University in London,

953
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,852
and become a playwright.

954
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,734
He wrote the most beautiful stories.

955
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,371
And he loved my cakes.

956
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,778
Everyone was very proud of him.

957
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,574
Until they found out
that he and l were in love...

958
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,897
and planned to marry as soon as
he'd finished his military service.

959
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:40,209
My father sacked our cook
and sent me back to England.

960
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,539
l was devastated.

961
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,979
But my Egyptian lover and l
wrote to each other in secret.

962
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,330
We were determined to get married.

963
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,133
Whateverthe cost.

964
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,778
He sent me this.

965
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,775
We promised each other we would
always wear one until we met again.

966
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,655
But then the '48 war started.

967
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:07,852
He was killed in
action within a few weeks.

968
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,454
l was the saddest girl on earth.

969
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,569
l went to Egypt to visit his grave.

970
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,533
And there his spirit came to me.

971
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,129
And promised me he would return.

972
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,333
Soon afterwards l was
very ill and lost my eyesight.

973
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,731
But l was never sad.

974
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,580
And l waited, and waited.

975
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,293
l'm sorry.

976
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,056
His name was Ali.

977
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,449
When l met you on the bus,
l was sure that you were him.

978
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,776
You are my Ali.

979
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:56,898
Madam, it doesn't mean because
my name is Ali that l'm your Ali.

980
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:59,489
There are millions of Alis in Egypt,

981
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,577
and half of them look like me.

982
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,930
l knew it would be
hard for you to believe,

983
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,414
but it is the truth.

984
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,329
-You are his reincarnation.
-That's impossible!

985
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,689
You're wrong, Ali.

986
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,653
Your past has made
you what you are.

987
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:18,370
This is the only
photograph of us l ever had.

988
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,852
And this is his last letter.

989
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,177
See, that's not my handwriting.

990
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,736
Handwriting often
changes during reincarnation.

991
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,975
These are all from him.

992
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,576
Read them if you want.

993
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,779
You wrote them.

994
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,775
So, where is my Scottish bride?

995
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,937
l was supposed to meet hertoday.

996
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,893
Yes, but she can't come,
one of her kids is ill.

997
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,819
But she'll be here next week.

998
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,933
-Are you sure about this woman?
-Of course.

999
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,779
She's one of the best.

1000
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,130
Don't worry, just leave it to me.

1001
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,811
What's happened...?

1002
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,059
What's happened to your hair?

1003
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,531
This is my new look.

1004
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,652
To match my new fake passport.

1005
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,692
l am Farouk Hasanien.

1006
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,813
Twenty-nine,
a ''ginger'' and beautiful.

1007
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,616
Don't show it to everybody.
Orthey will get you this time.

1008
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,496
ln their dreams.

1009
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,137
Listen,
could l stay in your place...

1010
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,729
until l find another room?

1011
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:38,729
l left my flat.
lmmigration fuckers are after me.

1012
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,137
Ahmed, l can't.
This woman is very strange.

1013
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:46,538
-l wish l could move too.
-l can't believe your sad luck.

1014
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,495
Of whole of London you
land in her house. lt's amazing.

1015
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,975
ls she after your dick yet?

1016
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,054
How I ache
to have you in my arms.

1017
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,252
If I can't hoId you soon I shaII die.

1018
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,612
I Iong for every part of you,
my dearest Sarah.

1019
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,011
I miss every inch of you.

1020
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,530
Being reunited with you in London...

1021
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:18,369
wiII give me aII I need
to become a great writer.

1022
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,979
Oh, shit, shit!

1023
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,213
Shit, shit!

1024
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:27,136
l looked this out for you.
lt's your galabia.

1025
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,856
You gave it to me before
l came to London. Remember?

1026
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,410
lt still has your smell.

1027
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,099
Listen, l read them all.

1028
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,690
-He was a very romantic man.
-Yes, you were.

1029
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,735
Okay, okay,

1030
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,614
if l said l believe in that l am him,

1031
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:47,336
and this is my galabia,
what you expect me to do?

1032
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,895
To fulfil the second
half of your promise.

1033
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,374
Which is what?

1034
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,253
To marry me.

1035
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,095
You seriously want me to marry you?

1036
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,336
Well, it's what you promised.

1037
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:05,259
-But madam, l'm...
-l'm not a madam.

1038
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,859
l've never married.

1039
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,415
And no other man
has evertouched me.

1040
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,294
l've saved myself for you.

1041
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,571
As this is my witness.

1042
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,533
That's very kind of you,

1043
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,618
but as you can see, l'm old enough
to be your grandson. lf you had one.

1044
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,210
You should have come back
40 years ago when l was young.

1045
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,535
And what your family will say?

1046
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,651
l have no family, Ali.

1047
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,578
l only have you.

1048
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:32,979
Please, Ali.

1049
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,449
l've waited all my life for you.

1050
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,734
Please, don't disappoint me now.

1051
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,536
l'm sorry, Miss Stevenson.

1052
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,096
l wish l can help you.

1053
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,012
But l can't.

1054
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,369
Hi, Mark and Fernando
are in Spain.

1055
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,616
We'II get in touch when we get back.

1056
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,255
Hi.

1057
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:11,539
Oh, Ali. You're back.
l thought you'd gone to Egypt.

1058
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:15,335
l'm sorry l haven't been in
contact with you.

1059
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:23,778
l've discovered that other men
could teach dance betterthan you,

1060
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,699
and they don't feel bad about it later.

1061
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:28,729
Mon cheri.

1062
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,378
Go, Ahmed. Go away.

1063
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,855
l have a knife in my hand.

1064
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:46,689
-Come on, don't be silly.
-Why you did that to me?

1065
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,971
l have no place to sleep.

1066
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:52,491
So she offered me to stay
at her house for four days.

1067
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,611
She's using you
to get her revenge on me!

1068
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,891
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

1069
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,569
Vivienne was right when
she said you were bloody complex.

1070
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,578
Where is my Scottish bride?

1071
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,532
Everyday you say
''tomorrow, tomorrow''.

1072
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,334
ls this bloody fake marriage
gonna happen or not?

1073
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,453
-lt will, but you must wait.
-l can't wait!

1074
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,937
Give me my money back.
l will get one myself.

1075
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:14,973
-l don't have the money.
-What?

1076
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,138
l had to use it for my fake passport.

1077
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,537
So l could stay
and organise your marriage.

1078
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,051
-You fucking spent my money?
-l will give it to you next week!

1079
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:28,776
Next week it will be too late!
l got nearly no time!

1080
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,017
l can't believe it!

1081
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,777
You have made the
declarations prescribed by law,

1082
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,416
and a solemn and
binding contract with each other,

1083
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,498
and now l pronounce
you man and wife.

1084
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,019
You may kiss the bride.

1085
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,377
No, l'm not joking.

1086
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:56,811
We have the wedding of the century.

1087
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,695
Ali.

1088
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,891
Since we have now been married,

1089
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:21,253
l believe l have the right
to ask just one more thing of you.

1090
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,616
Please, call me Sarah.

1091
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,379
l'm your wife now.

1092
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:30,972
Shame on you!

1093
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,899
Getting married without me...

1094
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:37,138
l waited forthis day all my life.

1095
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:41,054
l'm sorry, mama. lt was very quick.

1096
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:44,776
Send me the wedding pictures
to see what she's like.

1097
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:46,971
She's great. You will like her.

1098
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,579
Tell me , Ali...

1099
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,414
is she a...

1100
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,928
virgin or...?

1101
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:56,018
Yes, she's a virgin.
She was waiting for me.

1102
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,179
-Hi.
-Hi.

1103
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,333
What have you done?
Are you crazy?

1104
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:13,215
-What are you talking about?
-l'm talking about this.

1105
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:26,328
You was afraid l will take
your chick away from you.

1106
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,692
And that is why
you didn't want me to stay there.

1107
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,419
Why didn't you tell me
you fancy ancient women?

1108
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:37,898
l could find you a cheap one.
Five years younger and not blind.

1109
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,933
Fuck you, Ahmed!
What you want me to do?

1110
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,893
You spent all my money!
You use everyone!

1111
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:48,458
You're just a little shit, man!
No, you're a piece of shit!

1112
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:52,893
What about you?
You use everybody, too.

1113
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:56,650
And whatever you will get
is what you deserve!

1114
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,139
-Ahmed.
-Yes?

1115
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:01,888
-The police wants to talk to you.
-Oh, shit.

1116
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,417
-Are you Ahmed Zahoud?
-l've done nothing.

1117
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,055
You don't have to say anything.

1118
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,697
You're finished as well.

1119
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,289
l never faked any passport!

1120
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,136
This is for you, Ali.

1121
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,172
l don't want to interfere in your life,

1122
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:36,657
but you've been in
your room fortwo days now.

1123
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,852
Are you not going to work?

1124
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,812
No. l left.

1125
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,214
Was it because of me?

1126
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,819
Yes.

1127
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,569
Sarah, l'm not your Ali.

1128
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,298
l have done a bad thing.

1129
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,377
And he was a good man.

1130
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,094
He would not have done what l did.

1131
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,489
l only married you
because of my visa.

1132
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:05,210
Do you think l don't know?

1133
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,855
But that isn't the real truth, Ali.

1134
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,608
We married because that's fate.

1135
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:11,855
Our fate.

1136
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,858
Oh, look at me for a moment.

1137
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:17,499
You made me
the happiest girl in town.

1138
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,169
Have l?

1139
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,371
Yes, Ali, you have.

1140
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,891
But l did it for me.

1141
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,331
But you made me happy.

1142
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,330
You fulfilled your promise.

1143
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:33,774
You're free to go if you want to.

1144
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,288
Come in.

1145
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:57,775
-l'm very sorry for what l've done.
-lt's all right. l understand.

1146
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:05,815
Sarah.

1147
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,330
Was Ali a good writer?

1148
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,212
He was a great writer.

1149
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,378
He always wrote from his heart.

1150
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,457
You're a good writertoo.

1151
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,334
That's why God
has given you another chance.

1152
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,538
Don't lose it.

1153
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,698
Well, Mr Radwan.

1154
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,897
We can find no reason
not to give you a visa,

1155
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:43,411
since you are now
married to a British citizen.

1156
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:50,097
Congratulations
to the bride and groom.

1157
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,614
Thank you.

1158
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,013
Thank you for everything, Sarah.

1159
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,858
Thank you too, Ali.

1160
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,013
l'm so happy you came back to me.

1161
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:09,258
To your visa and our fate together.

1162
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,575
Cheers.

1163
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,578
Can you taste it?

1164
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,571
Good afternoon and weIcome.

1165
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,454
-Very good.
-Sarah, it's started!

1166
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:28,778
Our first subject is reincarnation.

1167
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:31,733
Is Iife reaIIy betterthe second time?

1168
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,853
-How do l look?
-Very beautiful.

1169
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:38,769
Sarah Radwan and
her young Egyptian husband AIi.

1170
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,290
Good afternoon to you both.

1171
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:44,890
You beIieve you met him
over 60 years ago?

1172
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:48,729
What convinced you
that AIi wouId return?

1173
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,851
-Mark.
-What?

1174
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:54,177
Mark, come in here.

1175
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:58,373
-lt's Ali on the television!
-Oh my God!

1176
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:03,976
And when AIi did return, did
you recognise him straight away?

1177
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:07,172
You don't get much for 1.000 pounds.

1178
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,610
I've been very Iucky.

1179
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,370
Meeting Sarah
changed everything for me.

1180
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,049
But that may be the one thing.

1181
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:20,049
You thought that this
was somehow aIways meant to be?

1182
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,409
Oh, yes, I...

1183
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,894
SaIut.

1184
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,174
Oh shit. Ali?

1185
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,695
-Meeting Sarah has heIped me.
-Wanker!

1186
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,295
He should be here, not me!

1187
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,253
Other boyfriends
whiIst AIi's been away?

1188
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,293
No other man
has touched me aII these years.

1189
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,491
-What?
-I waited for him.

1190
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:49,217
AIi, do you beIieve that
you are the AIi that died in 1948?

1191
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:53,857
I don't know if I beIieve
in reincarnation to be honest.

1192
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,018
But I beIieve in second chance.

1193
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:01,930
We'd aII Iike to beIieve in a second
chance in our Iife.

1194
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,770
What about going to
Luxor on a Nile cruise?

1195
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,369
And then we fly to Alexandria?

1196
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,772
-What do you think?
-Luxor.

1197
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,176
That would be wonderful.

1198
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,060
l could show you
where we used to live.

1199
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,497
Something better.

1200
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,176
Go to Cairo first...

1201
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,133
And then Luxor fortwo weeks.

1202
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,456
Sounds good too, no?

1203
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,213
Sarah?

1204
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,728
Sarah?

1205
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:41,178
Sarah?

1206
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:47,418
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy...

1207
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:52,376
to take unto Himself the soul of our
dear sister Sarah here departed.

1208
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:55,459
We therefore commit
her body to the ground,

1209
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,492
earth to earth,

1210
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:59,338
ashes to ashes,

1211
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,338
dust to dust.

1212
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:06,531
ln sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life,

1213
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:09,254
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

1214
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,776
who shall change our vile body,

1215
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,933
that it may be like
unto His glorious body.

1216
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,935
l'm getting divorced
next week. Finally.

1217
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:32,974
And then in September
l'm going to drama school.

1218
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:36,536
l always thought
l had a flare for drama.

1219
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,653
l wanna do it right this time, Ali.

1220
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,731
What about you?

1221
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,454
l've got everything
l was running after.

1222
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:50,097
A big house, a visa, a proper
commission for my next project.

1223
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:54,171
But l, l really want to go
to Egypt for a little while.

1224
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:56,690
l'm missing my family so badly.

1225
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:02,050
All the time l've been here,
l was trying to escape what l am.

1226
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,616
And Sarah,
