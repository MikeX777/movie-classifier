00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,848
<i>Welcome to Curaçao.
Welcome to Bon Bini Bungalows.</i>

2
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,886
<i>Hundred percent guaranteed.
Hundred percent vacation.</i>

3
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,924
<i>Dushi, your home away from home.</i>

4
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,728
<i>Guaranteed yours and yours alone.</i>

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,606
Nice weather, huh?
- Sorry?

6
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,485
Nice weather.
- Yes, it is.

7
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,648
Robert Florentijn.

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,690
First time on Curaçao?
- Yes, first time.

9
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,646
We're nearly there.
My partner Norbert Jan is waiting for us.

10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,651
Wait. I'll turn on the air conditioning.

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,170
I hope there's a swimming pool.
- A swimming pool?

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,611
No, I'm afraid not.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,121
Of course there's a pool.

14
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,403
And with water and everything. For free!
- Beautiful.

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,685
We're here. Say cheese.
A quick photo for the website.

16
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,769
Smile at the birdie.

17
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,530
Now the deposit and you can
go to the beach and get a nice tan.

18
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,927
But not too much of a tan
or they won't allow you back into Holland.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
Two hundred, right?
- Yes.

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,891
Five hundred.

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,126
Exchange rate. Euros, guilders.

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,209
How could you have forgotten
the passports?

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,448
Get the hell out of my house!

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,361
I thought they were gone.
- Don't think. You have to make sure.

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,451
How am I supposed to know they forgot the
passports? I'm not going to rummage around.

26
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,802
You just broke in, moron.

27
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,726
Dushi!

28
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,767
A bit of suntan lotion?

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,641
Remember, OK: Bon Bini Bungalows.

30
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,810
Bon Bini Bungalows?

31
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,601
Who wants to know?
- Eddie Velazquez.

32
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,721
What are you doing?
- Sorry, sorry.

33
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,208
That didn't go well.

34
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,041
Worked too hard and drank too little,
I think. That's dangerous.

35
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,165
Heat stroke.
- Yeah, I think so.

36
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,764
People forget they have to drink
plenty of fluids.

37
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,601
You too, I think. You look thirsty.
- Do I?

38
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,285
Noëlla.

39
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,641
They have good cocktails here.

40
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,970
Shall I get two? Because it was
sweet of you to take care of me.

41
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,606
You should get water,
that's better for you.

42
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,768
Is that better for me?

43
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,762
One cocktail and one water
coming up, Madam Noëlla.

44
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,405
Don't leave, OK?

45
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,811
Guys, that was funny.

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,083
Everyone had a barrel of laughs,
but we're done now. OK?

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,170
I don't want to get angry,
but I'm warning you:

48
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,648
if you don't take off the bag,
you have a problem. I swear.

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,969
And you know that I have
a pink and a yellow belt.

50
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,161
Well, well...

51
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,130
Robert Florentijn.
The big boss of Bon Bini Bungalows.

52
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,561
Señor Bon Bini.

53
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,763
Or should I say: Robertico Florentina?
- Did I rent you a villa?

54
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,440
I'll take care of any problems.

55
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,450
Are you not satisfied?
Didn't you get enough soap bars?

56
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,880
I can get you soap.

57
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
Weren't the towels soft enough?
I can get you towels.

58
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,845
Let me go and I'll take care of it.
- Not to me. From me.

59
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,127
Moron.

60
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,408
I arrived at my villa yesterday
and apparently there had been a party.

61
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,729
Even my children's stuffed toys
were barbecued.

62
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,809
What has that got to do with me?

63
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,970
I'll take care of it.

64
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,447
I'll come to your house and...
- No!

65
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,007
You don't touch my house,
my stuff and my children.

66
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,686
You're going to pay up.

67
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,804
200,000 guilders.
- Where am going to get that?

68
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,050
Or you'll pay in kind,
40,000...

69
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,287
...per limb.

70
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,403
But that's five limbs for 200,000.

71
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,887
I only have four limbs.

72
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,088
Eddie, come on. Let's talk.
Eddie! Come on, man.

73
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,884
Bye, Robertico.

74
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,921
Funny. Very funny.

75
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,684
You're joking, right?

76
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,011
There are no buses here!

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,403
Was that his house?!

78
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,682
I rented it to some students.

79
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,290
It was Fuik Day.

80
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,084
Of course it was Fuik Day!

81
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,807
You know what people do on Fuikday:
they drink and trash everything.

82
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,922
How am I supposed to pay him?

83
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,561
To what do I owe the honor
of his majesty of nightlife hitching a ride?

84
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,162
Dad, I need money.
- You can always get a job on my bus.

85
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,284
An honest day's work
never killed anyone.

86
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,202
How much?

87
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,407
200,000 guilders?!

88
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,884
Do you think I can just
pull that out of my pocket?

89
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,284
If I don't pay they'll chop off
my five limbs.

90
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,961
Five?

91
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,363
Good. Then you can start thinking
with your head for once.

92
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,211
Dad...

93
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,926
Stay calm. I've got an idea.
A place where you can be safe for now.

94
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,282
What do you mean? Where?

95
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,961
Fine. Send him over.

96
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,601
For the road.
- I'm in...

97
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,131
What?

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,604
<i>Kani stoba...</i>

99
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,601
<i>...saté ku batata, piska kora.</i>
- <i>Mom, I have to go.</i>

100
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,164
FC CHICKEN

101
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,364
I'd like a Crispy Chicken Super Size
Go Large Menu.

102
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,803
Crispy Chicken Go Large Menu?
Are you sure?

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,688
Wouldn't you rather have a salad,
or eggplant or pine nuts?

104
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,804
You look like a cottage cheese person.
Want cottage cheese?

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,843
Sure.
- We're out.

106
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,611
Hello.

107
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,651
Hello, sir.

108
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,647
Ma'am, are you going to help me?

109
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,690
Me help you?
Do I look like a plastic surgeon?

110
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,961
No one can help you.

111
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,891
What you need is a miracle,
because you look like a grape.

112
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,323
Can I have a Crispy Chicken
for this jungle gnome here.

113
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,045
Super Size.

114
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,768
Go Large.

115
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,608
Menu.

116
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,531
Where's Ping Ping?

117
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,281
Playing Rummikub with his mother
in a container? I don't know.

118
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,847
Chinese people are always late.
- And you're always on time?

119
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,608
Right on the dot.

120
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,242
Don't touch me, idiot.

121
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,523
New chicken burgers. Sign this.
- But, Ping Ping, that's horse meat.

122
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,850
No way. It's real chicken.
Horse chicken.

123
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,769
Not horse meat, horse chicken.

124
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,124
It runs and flies fast.
It's horse chicken. Very good chicken.

125
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,164
Noltie, I have a special suit for you.

126
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,886
You'll make a big impression
on the ladies.

127
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,844
Genuine Versace.

128
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,449
Noltie, are you sure
that suit wasn't stolen?

129
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,324
What if the police comes?
I'll be deported.

130
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,443
You'll be deported?
I'll be deported.

131
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,801
Noltie, dough.

132
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,850
Huh?
- Dough.

133
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,721
Dough!

134
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,362
Special price for you:
only 50 euros.

135
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,971
40.
- 100.

136
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,321
50.
- 150.

137
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,284
Deal!

138
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,326
Shouldn't you answer the phone?

139
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,086
Is it your phone?
Are they calling you?

140
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,089
Did your phone go ring, ring, ring?

141
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,080
Do we need those customers?
We don't, jungle gnome.

142
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,085
OK. Jungle gnome.

143
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,729
Well, if anyone here is from the jungle,
it's you, jungle bunny.

144
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,207
What did you say?

145
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,722
What did you call me?

146
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,561
Jungle bunny.

147
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,081
Jungle bunny? Your mother.

148
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,444
Hello, this is restaurant FC Chicken.

149
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,643
Judeska, there's telephone for you.
- You too, Mr. Annoying?

150
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,208
It's your nephew, Robertico.
He's waiting for you.

151
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,041
Just a moment, sir.

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,286
I'll be right back.

153
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,084
Guys, I'm off!

154
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,571
Hello, hello, hello, rude people!

155
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,001
Hello, out of my way!

156
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,522
Hello, out of my way! Move it.

157
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,926
I ONLY BRAKE FOR JOHN WILLIAMS!!

158
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,526
Welcome to Holland.

159
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,330
Auntie?
- Who did you expect? Beyoncé?

160
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,003
Get in. Go, go, go.
Chop chop, idiot.

161
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,404
Great song, auntie.

162
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,649
Great song...

163
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,640
What are you doing here anyway,
Mr. Annoying?

164
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,410
A kind of sabbatical.

165
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,604
A whattical?

166
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,246
Just a change of scenery. Vacation.

167
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,126
Listen, don't talk, don't move...

168
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,927
...and don't breathe either.
Nothing! Vacation.

169
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,966
Everyone whines about a vacation
and who has to work? Me.

170
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,803
Stupid whore! Shut up!

171
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,050
Did you kick him out again?
Don't kick him out, stab him.

172
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,481
Twice in the neck. Stab, stab, done.

173
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,411
That hassle all the time.

174
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,044
Thank you for letting me stay
in your studio.

175
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,846
Studio?
- That's what my mom said.

176
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,969
Of course. You will get a studio.

177
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,322
A nail studio, roof pigeon.

178
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,603
And here is your mat.
Bye, bye, dushi.

179
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,048
<i>I missed you, bro.</i>

180
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,884
<i>Hey, dushi.
Want some suntan lotion?</i>

181
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,286
Hurry up.

182
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,166
Get up. You're not staying here
for free, you know.

183
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,011
Where's my deposit.
Wok To Go here needs to be paid.

184
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,522
Go get a job.
I don't run a charity.

185
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,121
Hurry up, Chow Mein.

186
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,245
A job?

187
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,721
Good afternoon, ladies.
- And who might you be?

188
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,481
Can't you introduce yourself?
That's how it's done in the Netherlands.

189
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,966
A bit of decency.

190
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,243
"Hello, madam. Thank you for welfare."
Am I right?

191
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,920
My apologies. Robertico Florentina.
Nice to meet you.

192
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,485
What?

193
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,524
What's he saying?
I don't understand.

194
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,644
Nice to meet you.
- You should take Dutch lessons.

195
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,084
What are you doing here, anyway?
- I'm staying with my aunt. Down there.

196
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,847
God, another one.
"I'm staying with my aunt."

197
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,247
That's how they call it these days:
Staying.

198
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
The gentleman's staying for a week
in Holland.

199
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,010
Forever, you mean. Retard.

200
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,249
Listen, kid. I was born here, right?

201
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,841
Everyone comes here,
but no one ever leaves.

202
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,724
I just call them as I see them.

203
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,606
Ladies, I have to go. See you later.
- See you later?

204
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,122
Don't bother coming back.
But they always do. Retard.

205
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,721
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

206
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,161
I've never worked for a boss.
- Right.

207
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,170
I'm an entrepreneur,
so I seize my opportunities.

208
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,362
I'm someone who helps people.

209
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,042
Helping people. Right.
So you actually have no experience.

210
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,489
I have...
- So this isn't going to be it.

211
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,524
My sister had a family like that
move in next door.

212
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,485
The stench wasn't normal.

213
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,286
Cooking every evening. Every...
That's not normal, is it?

214
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,323
Yes, listen, here...

215
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,764
What would you do if you found
your old lady in bed with some moron?

216
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,851
Would it be so weird for you to follow
that guy through the area with a crowbar...

217
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,930
...and then smearing his brains
all over the place? Or am I crazy?

218
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,768
A crowbar?
- Crowbar?

219
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,930
You want something with a crowbar.
Crowbar, crowbar...

220
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,043
That might be difficult.

221
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,722
Why cook every evening?
Just grab something out of the freezer.

222
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,685
Microwave some normal Dutch food.
Right?

223
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,850
They must have money growing on trees,
eating all those chickens.

224
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,246
Black or white?

225
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,841
Black or...?
- How you want to get paid.

226
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,485
Black, right? In your case.

227
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,411
And then they say:
You're welcome to come and eat.

228
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,887
Well, I rang the doorbell five times
and just stood there.

229
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,651
How much do you think they pay?
- Who?

230
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,370
For those soccer players these days.
130 million a week! That's insane.

231
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,882
It's because of those Arabs.
A bit of water-piping behind the camel.

232
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,651
A bit of soccer in the sandbox.
With their Qatar.

233
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,411
I'm fed up with it.
With all those Poles...

234
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,968
...and all those Caribbeans.
Not sure where they're all from.

235
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,846
Those guys are talented, don't get me wrong,
but they lack experience.

236
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,930
I personally still have
a very good left one.

237
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,209
Ouch. Dammit.
- Anita, shut your piehole!

238
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,609
So can't help you with this one either.

239
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,330
Right, this may be something.
It's been open for a long time.

240
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,080
Are you into food?

241
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,841
Because we can't find a single retard
for this job.

242
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,045
But looking at you,
this may be tailor-made for you.

243
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,682
How do you like your first day on the job?
- Funny how you idiots call this a job.

244
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,123
Why not ask money for breathing?

245
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,846
Have the phone number of some babes?
- 911.

246
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,089
Don't call. That's the police.
They'll deport me.

247
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,001
It's just positive discrimination.
We don't need another monkey.

248
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,010
Rajhesh, he just arrived in the Netherlands.
Be nice.

249
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,567
He's a monkey?
You're a monkey.

250
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,601
Oh, ram ram.

251
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,567
What kind of get-together is this?
Are you celebrating independence Day?

252
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,525
What do you think? You're my nephew,
so you don't have to work?

253
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,484
Where's my Crispy Chicken Menu?

254
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,368
The customer is king, you know.
You can't just keep them waiting.

255
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,483
I'm off for 30 minutes.
To the bathroom.

256
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,001
Can I have the chicken wings...

257
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,565
...without the bones.

258
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,521
No, I'll have the chicken cheeseburger...

259
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,765
...without cheese.

260
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,723
What exactly don't you like
about this sandwich?

261
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,443
There is chicken on it.

262
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,847
What?

263
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,805
Everyone shits. Hello!
Beyoncé shits.

264
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,163
Maxima shits. Your mother shits.

265
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,889
Seriously, though.
Kofi, how do you keep this up?

266
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,290
This job. How do you do that?
- Come on, Robertico. Stay positive.

267
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,290
It's better than where I came from.

268
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,246
I'm a refugee from a country
full of war and misery.

269
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,125
And now I can work here every day!

270
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,127
He destroyed my house,
now it's your turn!

271
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,448
Show me the money!

272
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,369
Hurry up.

273
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,686
It's the day of the Lord!

274
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,126
Get up. It's Sunday,
the day of the Lord.

275
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,322
Hurry. Go, go, go.

276
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,807
But it's raining.
- Did Noah wait...

277
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,722
...until someone closed the tap?
We're going to church. God bless.

278
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,165
Hello, we're here. God bless.

279
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,204
There she is. Don't like her.

280
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,731
Hello, sister.

281
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,606
Her mouth smells like death. Can't stand it.
This is the spot.

282
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,725
Did your hairdresser use a hedge trimmer?
Or were you underneath a car?

283
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,968
You look like a bird, Cockatoo.

284
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,401
Don't touch me, Pavarotti.

285
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,046
You can only wish
getting a taste of me.

286
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,365
Ooh-la-la, listen to those notes.
I'm musical too, you know.

287
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,804
I can play those notes on my flute.

288
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,609
Nice, man.

289
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,962
We're in church.
Can you take it seriously?

290
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,122
You're right, sister. Some things
do need to be taken seriously.

291
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,722
I'm going to do things to her.
Nice things. Naughty things.

292
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,083
Blessed boom boom things.

293
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,441
Good to see you here, Robertico.
Spirituality will do you good.

294
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,962
The message for today,
brothers and sisters...

295
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,131
...is that it's time for a change.

296
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,448
Time for change, brothers and sisters.

297
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,041
You're in church, you know.

298
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,130
What are you talking about?
It's the Host.

299
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,651
Host ham and cheese.

300
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,571
You smell it. You want some too.
Right, Bokito?

301
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,048
You're not getting anything.
I can get you some bullets. Bam, bam.

302
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,481
Next time I'll bring chicken.

303
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,490
I just need some dip, though.

304
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,931
God bless, lady in red.

305
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,602
You know what they say about
people wearing red:

306
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,404
I don't stop.

307
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,605
It's a hassle, but you know what I mean.
Amen.

308
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,327
Amen, brothers and sisters.
Hallelujah.

309
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,122
There are only two men in my life:
Jesus and John Williams.

310
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,806
Holy shit!
- Hello, you can't curse in church.

311
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,243
<i>200,000 guilders, or you'll never
see your little island again. Eddie.</i>

312
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,924
Today we'd like to thank
our brother Ken Maduro.

313
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,251
His generous gift made it possible
for our wonderful church...

314
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,161
...to have a brand new audio system.

315
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,771
Testing!

316
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,605
Brother Maduro, stand up.
A big hand for brother Maduro.

317
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,761
Kofi, who is he?

318
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,365
Ken Maduro of Maduro Hotels.
He's very rich.

319
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,803
He's from Curaçao as well
and started out from scratch.

320
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,049
He started out from scratch?
I started out from scratch.

321
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,289
Noltie, do you have
Ping Ping's phone number?

322
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,643
Who are all those chicks?
- No one. They're family.

323
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,607
Aunt, niece... Creative therapy.
Hobby.

324
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,522
So this is where you make those suits?
- No, it's German quality. Made in China.

325
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,926
Look...

326
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,329
Child-labor-free.
- Yes!

327
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,491
What do I owe you?
- No, I'll send you an invoice.

328
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,010
Robertico, bye.

329
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,647
What are you doing in there?

330
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,287
Well, they're good at dancing,
but they're work-shy.

331
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,767
Welcome to the Royal Maduro, sir.
How may I help you?

332
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,803
I'm here to see Ken Maduro.

333
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,926
And your name is?
- Robert.

334
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,249
Robert Florentijn of Bon Bini
Business international.

335
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,482
I don't see your name here,
Mr. Florentijn.

336
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,445
It's possible I may not be
on the schedule.

337
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,440
I've been staying here for a while
and would like to compliment Mr. Maduro...

338
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,449
...on his excellent choice in staff.

339
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,969
I've stayed in hotels all over the globe...

340
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,960
...but I've never seen such pretty ladies
at reception before.

341
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,491
Gosh.

342
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,322
Mr. Maduro isn't here right now.
He'll be here tomorrow, I think.

343
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,000
He's playing golf.
- Golf?

344
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,444
Good afternoon.

345
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,809
Isn't it great? An hour out of the office?

346
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,521
Sometimes it's good for them
to just let them find it out for themselves.

347
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,564
A 100 employees and who has to
take care of things? We do!

348
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,330
Men like us.

349
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,769
Yeah, man. Tiger Woods.

350
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,203
I recognize that. Hitting things
is good therapy.

351
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,041
I told my secretary to cancel
my appointments. It's me-time.

352
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,642
I'm the boss, so I can do what I want.
I'm the boss...

353
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,330
Are you going to hit that ball?

354
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,611
Yes.

355
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,160
First time?

356
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,327
Was it that obvious?

357
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,888
I heard that if you want to do business here
you have to play golf.

358
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,049
We do it differently on Curaçao.

359
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,125
Curaçao?

360
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,850
I haven't laughed this hard
for a long time, Robert.

361
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,403
We're having people over
for dinner tonight.

362
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,967
Why don't you come?
I'd enjoy that.

363
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,885
Forget it.

364
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,686
Not again. This ain't gonna happen.

365
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,804
I don't know what you have in mind,
but this ain't gonna happen.

366
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,288
In the end, you're all the same.

367
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,689
Sorry, but I'm in rush.
- I've got news for you...

368
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,681
There's no way your Space Needle
is entering my Sherwood Forest. Retard.

369
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,602
And don't think you can open
my door through the broken window...

370
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,408
...and sneak around in my bedroom
while I'm wearing my nightgown.

371
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,047
You'd like to fool around in my tunnel,
wouldn't you? Retard.

372
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,483
For once I'm wearing a nice sweater
and everyone jumps my bones.

373
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,491
You and your money management show.

374
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,765
You can manage me anyway you want,
dushi.

375
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,888
You're too hot. If I ever were to meet you
I'd smack you down straight away.

376
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,641
What the heck are you wearing?
- Business, auntie.

377
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,287
You're going to do business
in that?

378
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,482
Hear that, John Williams?
He has business.

379
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,566
Auntie, can you drive me
to Kralingen East?

380
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,005
What is that?

381
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,361
What? My leg?
- Move it forward.

382
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,645
Like this?
- And the other one.

383
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,042
That's my other leg.
- Move that one forward.

384
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,210
Know what we call that?

385
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,847
Walking. With your grave digger face.
Idiot.

386
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,166
Huh?

387
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,487
It's Curaçao.

388
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,411
Right?

389
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,368
What are you doing here?
- I'm here for Ken Maduro.

390
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,767
Doesn't he live here?
- He does.

391
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,484
Do you work here?

392
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,967
Yes, something like that.

393
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,571
Well, well...

394
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,803
What a pleasant surprise.

395
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,609
<i>Cheri,</i> top me up, please.

396
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,290
If you go to the kitchen later.

397
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,962
The chef has a question about
the pudding, or something.

398
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,484
<i>C'est une dessert, cheri.</i>
Pudding sounds common, don't you think?

399
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,244
So you are?

400
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,369
Ken Ma... Robert Florentijn.
Nice to meet you.

401
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,121
Very nice indeed, Robbie.
I'm Sylvia Maduro.

402
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,084
So you're the wife of...
- Oh, Robbie.

403
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,169
We've known each other
for such a long time.

404
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,727
You can call me Sylvia.

405
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,049
Ah, Robert, you're here. Come in.
- Yes, nice.

406
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,560
Hey, having dinner with us?

407
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,971
Is that OK?

408
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,091
Don't you have to work?
- No.

409
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,965
At home I can usually have dinner
with the rest.

410
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,802
Mine wasn't cooked, by the way.
- It's carpaccio.

411
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,764
Noëlla Maduro.

412
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,090
Robert Florentijn.

413
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,760
Sorry about that cocktail.
Something came up.

414
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,803
Something? Or someone?

415
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,651
No. Well, there was someone,
but not someone like that.

416
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,763
What are you two talking about?

417
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,289
We've met before on Curaçao.
- Oh, that's nice.

418
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,565
I thought you had an internship there.
I didn't know your thesis was about men.

419
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,041
Ladies and gentlemen, the escargots.

420
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,011
Bon appetit.

421
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,888
I'm so sorry. I'll wipe it off.

422
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,846
Thank you.

423
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,847
So what do you do on Curaçao,
besides harassing my girlfriend?

424
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,325
I have...

425
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,081
...a company: Bon Bini Bungalows.

426
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,129
Bon Bini international.

427
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,406
We're international.

428
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,011
Interesting, a young entrepreneur.
What a coincidence.

429
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,884
So what brings you to the Netherlands?

430
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,608
Guys, let's not talk about business.
- Sylvia, let him finish.

431
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,644
What are you doing now, Robert?
- Now?

432
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,121
I'm here to increase my opportunities.
- Increase even further?

433
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,122
Is everything OK over there?
- I'll get it.

434
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,847
No, I'll get it.
- No, I will. No trouble at all.

435
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,848
Did you know that Hong Kong
is an island as well?

436
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,486
Or 235 small islands, actually.

437
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,684
They call it Nyan Kun, by the way.
Did you know that?

438
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,202
Got it.

439
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,804
But if you just say 'Hong Kong',
they understand what you mean too.

440
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,290
Robert?

441
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,448
Robert?

442
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,483
What is your next step?

443
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,411
That entrepreneurial zest is wonderful.

444
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,083
Well, I have my eye on a piece of land
I want to build on.

445
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,964
Bon Bini Bungalows. And...

446
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,171
The investors are lining up.

447
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,729
All I need now is a money injection.

448
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,811
Interesting. Let's light up a cigar later
and you can tell me all about it.

449
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,729
I love cigars!

450
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,090
There. We deserve that.

451
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,568
It's very good.

452
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,649
I'd love doing something
on Curaçao again.

453
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,411
I think we should focus
on that deal in Hong Kong.

454
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,729
Paomo industries. That's where
the opportunities are.

455
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,604
They made us a great offer.

456
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,641
Us?
- Patrick is my right hand.

457
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,842
We're working on a takeover
in Hong Kong.

458
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,170
Nice too, but this is different.
Investing on Curaçao.

459
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,971
It's as if I came full circle.
- I'm not so sure.

460
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,687
Before we look at the former colonies,
we have to do an assessment.

461
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,530
Have you even seen a CV?

462
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,282
You've got a CV, I assume.

463
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,084
Robert?

464
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,284
A CV? No, no one on Curaçao
has a CV.

465
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,084
It's too hot. Everyone has an AC.

466
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,251
Did you hear that?

467
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,405
Too hot!

468
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,009
Very funny.

469
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,484
He says the investors are lining up.
You've got a business plan, I assume?

470
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,648
Yes, I have an entire plan.

471
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,242
With business and things and...

472
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,647
We'll come by tomorrow
and you can present it.

473
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,611
Come by?
- Yes.

474
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,246
I mean, let's do it at your office.

475
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,806
You two? OK, that's fine.

476
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,722
No problem. Great.

477
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,891
Jesus.

478
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,320
Focus.

479
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,563
Come on, people!

480
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,644
I can't work like this.

481
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,803
A bit of calcium.

482
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,805
What are you looking at?
I need to top up, a bit of energy.

483
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,167
Deska, coming?

484
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,930
It's cold. I miss you.

485
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,405
I'm almost as fresh as a daisy.
I have a date with RTL Late Night.

486
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,526
Why the sour face?
- I can't find an office.

487
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,326
Office? I can get you one.
- Really?

488
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,007
I'll take care of it.
50 euros on top of your deposit.

489
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,202
PROBATION

490
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,122
Did I introduce you to my partner?
My right hand. Kofi.

491
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,926
Kofi... Anan.
- Really?

492
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,131
Any relations?
- Yes.

493
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,970
Two sisters and a brother.

494
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,286
Something to drink?

495
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,691
I'll have a cup of tea, please.
- Coffee.

496
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,521
Yes?

497
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,961
Coffee.
- Yes?

498
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,404
Yes. Coffee. Is that a problem?
- I don't have a problem.

499
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,524
You have a problem.
- Great, bro.

500
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,165
Some coffee. Something to drink.

501
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,088
An odd location for an office,
don't you think?

502
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,446
No. It was vacant, so I thought:
second chance. That's our motto.

503
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,531
Remember I said to you this afternoon:
second chance? Like a vacation.

504
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,161
A vacation is a second chance too.
You start all over. Bon Bini Bungalows.

505
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,929
All-inclusive bungalow resort
near the water.

506
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,201
So you get water at your bungalow.

507
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,529
No more walking.
So you have water, bungalow.

508
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,963
Water is your garden.

509
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,163
Dolphin in your garden.
Who has that these days?

510
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,249
And you can be part of that.
Got nearly all of the funding.

511
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,920
We need another 20%,
so 200,000 guilders.

512
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,125
That comes down to...
- 84,000 euros.

513
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,564
84,000 euros.
- Exactly. 84,000 euros.

514
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,606
You'd be crazy not to get in on it.
Right?

515
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,531
Great.

516
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,564
It's impressive, Robert.

517
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,842
I could just feel the warm sand
on my feet.

518
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,885
So you're in?
- Absolutely. It has potential.

519
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,321
Potential is my middle name.

520
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,689
So can we sign?
- Fortunately, we're not in a rush.

521
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,362
We first need to see some things.
For instance, do you have...

522
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,046
...a deed of the site?

523
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,765
Or the permits?

524
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,643
Permits...

525
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,320
Of course. Consider it done.

526
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,531
I'll hear from you, once everything is settled.
- I'll call you, Ken.

527
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,164
That looked good, Florentijn.
- Thank you.

528
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,968
Almost too good to be true.
An opportunity like that all of a sudden.

529
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,448
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were scamming us.

530
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,244
No way.

531
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,089
Me, scamming?

532
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,929
Stop that act, man.

533
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,248
Norwin, wassup?
- Tico, is that you?

534
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,887
Where are you?
- In Holland, with my aunt.

535
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,484
Eddie is looking for you
all over the island.

536
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,162
He's hopping mad.
- Bro, don't worry about Eddie.

537
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,410
Doesn't your cousin work for the city?
- Yes. Reginald.

538
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,729
Listen, go and see him and get him
to get you a copy...

539
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,968
...of the deed of a big piece of land.

540
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,846
That's what I need. Land by the beach.
And send it express.

541
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,725
What do you want with it?
- It's for Ken Maduro.

542
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,843
Ken Maduro?
- Never mind.

543
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,681
My mother has the address. Send it.
- OK, express.

544
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,211
I'll try my best, buddy.

545
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,807
Ice cream, lollipops, chips.

546
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,206
Come and get it.

547
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,243
Don't forget about me.

548
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,364
If anyone around here deserves a vacation,
it's me.

549
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,929
I can just see myself in my luxury bungalow
and my sexy lingerie.

550
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,567
Those bungalows aren't real.
- What do you mean 'not real'?

551
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,449
One Crispy Chicken Menu, please.
- Coming up, sir.

552
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,401
Is it immigration?
Are they coming to get me?

553
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,568
I don't want to go back!
- What are you doing?

554
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,563
Hey, don't you shush me.

555
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,809
Do it one more time
and I'll smack you.

556
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,524
Hello, may I order?
- Rude. Can't you see I'm busy?

557
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,405
With your ugly mug.
- Pardon?

558
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,085
I just want a Crispy Chicken Special.
- We're out.

559
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,841
Out?
- Can't you lip read? Out!

560
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,965
What a coincidence.

561
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,528
What are you doing here?
- The same thing you're doing here.

562
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,849
For the chicken.
It's better than those snails.

563
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,170
Dushi, he still lives with his mom.
- Is she talking to you?

564
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,447
No, I'm just a customer here,
with chicken.

565
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,167
He lives with his mom.
She doesn't know he lives with his mom.

566
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,246
Shall we sit down?

567
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,843
Hey, hello, who are you?
Who are you?

568
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,762
You're ugly. You're ugly too.
Let's be ugly together. OK.

569
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,924
Why were you on Curaçao,
by the way?

570
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,331
For an internship.

571
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,410
For how long were you there?
- Six months.

572
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,250
Without your boyfriend?

573
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,401
I can live without him
for six months.

574
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,002
I don't know from which cemetery
he dug this one up. Skeleton.

575
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,807
Give that girl a sandwich.
Victoria Secret.

576
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,890
If anyone is Victoria Secret,
it's me.

577
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,771
How did you like...

578
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,047
...Curaçao?
- Wonderful.

579
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,289
The weather is great
and the people are so sweet.

580
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,290
And the food.
- The food! Wonderful.

581
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,882
I miss my mom's food. She makes
the best Galina Stoba of the island.

582
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,527
No one makes it better.
- I'd love to taste it.

583
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,163
Tico, when you're done...

584
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,728
...take that girl outside
and bring the trash inside.

585
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,684
Robert!
- Good evening.

586
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,008
What are you doing here?
- I came to see Noëlla.

587
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,727
Noëlla? She isn't here.
- She isn't?

588
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,241
She went out for dinner with Patrick.

589
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,685
OK. Then I'll come back
some other time.

590
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,767
Have a nice evening.
- Same to you.

591
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,889
What do you have there, anyway?

592
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,445
I've been negotiating for months.
I've been to Hong Kong twice.

593
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,531
The deal is nearly closed and dad
can only think about Bonobo Business.

594
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,051
Bon Bini.

595
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,767
A bonobo is an ape.

596
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,964
Are you laughing at me?

597
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,560
Did you see his office?
It looks like a crack house.

598
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,286
I'm sure it's not that bad.
- He's an amateur.

599
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,767
Honey, can't you just talk to your dad?

600
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,246
About what?

601
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,647
About that deal with the Chinese.

602
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,241
It has to be closed.
That's best for both parties.

603
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,889
Can we please talk about something else?
- By now they think I'm some amateur.

604
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,927
But the professional manner in which
I managed to bag the deal is incredible.

605
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,250
I'm not just doing it for myself.
No, I'm working my ass off for dad.

606
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,920
But he suddenly doesn't care
about my Chinese anymore.

607
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,765
The crazy thing is that I used to do that.
Now it's all about the numbers.

608
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,487
"What's the capital surplus?
Do you have a zero-coupon bond?"

609
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,481
"What's the functional reconstruction value?"

610
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,089
That's what occupies me each day.
It drives me nuts.

611
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,691
Tomato.

612
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,327
Just last week I was in a meeting
and someone asked...

613
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,809
Your father doesn't listen to me anymore.
It feels like he doesn't take me seriously.

614
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,482
So I'm wondering:
Why do I work so hard?

615
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,603
That deal in Hong Kong...
- Let me guess...

616
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,962
You've been working on it for three months.
- Sorry?

617
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,242
Exactly. Sorry.

618
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,922
You've been talking about it all evening.
- Oh, Noëlla!

619
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,085
I'm going home.

620
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,605
Honey...

621
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,245
Sweetheart...

622
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,240
Don't forget to mention those Chinese
to your dad, though.

623
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,327
Business, right?
That deal will work out.

624
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,080
You have to taste this, sweetie.
Taste.

625
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,161
Is this your mother's famous chicken?

626
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,564
Better than that posh joint, right?

627
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,802
Dance with me, dushi,
dance with me.

628
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,849
What did you put in that recipe?
Haven't seen him like that in years.

629
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,087
I want that recipe.

630
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,205
<i>Changer.</i>

631
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,530
Where are you?
I've been waiting for 15 minutes.

632
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,882
Where?
- At the theater.

633
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,164
That's tonight.
- Oh, right. Completely forgot.

634
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,011
You got us the tickets.
How can you forget?

635
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,124
I'm sorry, but I can't leave now.
I have to go.

636
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,931
One moment.

637
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,888
<i>Hello? Robert?</i>

638
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,684
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Noëlla!

639
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,761
<i>How's it going?</i>
- Well, I'm freezing out here.

640
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,371
I have an extra opera ticket.

641
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,403
<i>Feel like coming?</i>

642
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,689
In the Netherlands? When?
- Now!

643
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,605
I'm going to see Oprah! Woohoo.

644
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,810
It's awesome that I can come.
I can't believe she's in the Netherlands.

645
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,162
She comes here frequently.
- What?

646
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,930
I love her music.

647
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,485
She sings?

648
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,531
Who the fuck is this?
Where's Oprah?

649
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,449
Robert...
- Where's Oprah?

650
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,449
Opera?
- Yes, Oprah.

651
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,120
This is opera.
- Her?

652
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,169
It's Tania Kross.

653
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,964
Did you know she was coming?
- Yes.

654
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,640
There's nothing underneath my chair.
Nothing!

655
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,923
I told people I'm getting a car!

656
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,210
She told me Oprah was going to be here.
And I'd be getting a car.

657
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,243
I told everyone...

658
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,920
I told everyone I'd be getting a car.

659
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,010
OK, we'll watch Tania Kross.

660
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,649
Tania, we love you!

661
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,606
We want more! We want more!

662
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,848
Nice.
- There you go.

663
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,726
Finally the promised cocktail.
- Cheers.

664
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,166
Sorry you didn't get a free car.

665
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,170
But it was kind of beautiful, though. Right?
- Kind of?

666
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,570
I've never seen anything this beautiful
in my life. The emotions, the music.

667
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,163
And at some point the drums
sounded like galloping horses and they...

668
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,169
Phenomenal!
- Yes.

669
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,001
Those high notes were incredible.
- Exactly.

670
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,567
Sorry.

671
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,761
Sorry, that wasn't my intention.

672
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,007
So what was your intention?
- It was kind of spur of the moment.

673
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,489
I lost myself in you. Suddenly.

674
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,364
I won't do it again.

675
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,168
I like spur of the moment.

676
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,971
A restaurant on the bungalow site.

677
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,562
I can just picture it.
A cute little restaurant.

678
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,288
With fresh fish on the menu
and fungi and baked banana.

679
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,290
I can also picture an old man
playing live music.

680
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,125
What's wrong?

681
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,084
You don't want a restaurant?

682
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,770
It's not that.

683
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,320
It's Bon Bini. Sometimes I'm not sure
I should do business with your dad.

684
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,364
Business and friendship...
What if it all goes wrong?

685
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,801
What if it isn't what you expected?

686
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,368
I might lose everything.
Maybe I should find another investor.

687
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,927
My father knows what he's doing.

688
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,844
He believes in you.

689
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,970
And so do I.

690
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,965
And you get a car.

691
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,767
Norwin?
- Surprise, bro!

692
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,402
Give me a hug.

693
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,484
What the fuck are you doing here?
- You said ' express'.

694
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,331
What can be more express than this?
- What?

695
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,524
You're not hustling without me, are you?
- Of course not.

696
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,566
So what do you want with Ken Maduro
and this deed?

697
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,481
OK, listen... You don't understand.
- You reeled in a big fish...

698
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,411
...but you don't want to share it with me.
Bon Bini is mine too.

699
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,523
Or did you forget, bro?

700
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,087
Hey, Robert! Nice to see you.

701
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,171
Who did you bring along?
- Pleased to meet you. Norbert Jan.

702
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,728
Loyal partner of Robert. I came here
to bring the deed myself.

703
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,321
By express.
- I can't wait.

704
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,922
Let's go upstairs.
- Ken, I wanted...

705
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,966
The best spot on the island.
- Wonderful. It couldn't have been better.

706
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,640
Only the best is good enough
for Bon Bini.

707
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,729
There's just one problem.

708
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,044
I want a majority interest.

709
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,005
I don't like having a small stake.

710
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,202
How much to buy out
the other investors?

711
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,890
One million guilders.
- Ken, please, this is going too far.

712
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,082
Why? You have no idea
how beautiful it is there.

713
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,964
This is something I need to do.

714
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,481
Ken, sorry, but Patrick is right.

715
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,206
Don't rush into things.
- Nonsense.

716
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,364
I make decisions intuitively
and my intuition tells me to do this.

717
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,608
So does mine, Ken.

718
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,041
So does mine.
- Deal.

719
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,122
I think we're ready to sign.
- Don't fall for this, man.

720
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,724
It will work out, Mr. Maduro.
We'll throw in a palm tree, if you want.

721
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,002
That's not necessary, Norbert Jan.

722
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,166
Patrick, don't forget to cancel
those Chinese.

723
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,051
Tico!

724
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,327
A million! We'll never have to work again.
- As if you ever worked.

725
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,763
What's wrong?
- You ruined everything.

726
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,281
Like always. First on Curaçao
and now here!

727
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,963
You're just jealous.
You can't stand that I fixed this.

728
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,481
Jesus, man.
- The great Robertico.

729
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,411
I'm just as great as you
and I don't need you at all.

730
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,843
I'll arrange it myself.
- Fine. Then arrange how you get home.

731
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,162
You should take the Coolsingel,
the Schiekade and the Bergweg...

732
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,931
Norbert Jan, congratulations
on your success.

733
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,407
Where's Robert?
- He was in a hurry.

734
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,571
That's too bad. I wanted to raise
a glass to the good results.

735
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,481
Really?
- You don't close a mega deal every day.

736
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,569
Shall we go to the bar?

737
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,610
Thank you.

738
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,529
Everything's about him.

739
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,486
Even though I always come up
with good ideas.

740
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,124
Bon Bini Bungalows.

741
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,766
My idea.
- Is that right?

742
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,684
What's wrong, Robertico?
You look worried.

743
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,811
Kofi, imagine that you...

744
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,685
...could go back home tomorrow.
- But there's a war over there.

745
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,769
Suppose it would be safe
and you can return.

746
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,440
That would be great.
- On one condition...

747
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,125
You have to hurt someone.

748
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,488
Wow. That's an intense moral
and spiritual dilemma.

749
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,604
You don't need to tell me.

750
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,805
Honesty lasts the longest.
My father always said that.

751
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,649
Take the situation
with my residence permit...

752
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,447
When you're honest,
it always lasts the longest.

753
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,885
I think our fathers are the same.
- Is your father from Sudan as well?

754
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,321
What?

755
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,284
What about those bungalows?

756
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,244
What about what?

757
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,250
What kind of bungalows are they?
Do they belong to you guys?

758
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,891
Have a look.

759
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,690
The customers always like
having their picture taken.

760
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,564
Hey, what's going on. Hello!

761
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,207
You said you had a date,
but I don't want this in my house.

762
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,325
I don't tolerate this kind of obscenity.
- It's not what you think it is.

763
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,411
This is Norwin.
- Even if it were John Williams!

764
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,964
Hello, madam.
- Get lost.

765
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,243
I don't want to touch you.
I don't know where your hands have been.

766
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,489
It's just for a few nights.
- Just pay that deposit.

767
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,364
And change the sheets.

768
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,166
Filthiness. Law & Ordure.

769
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,405
<i>Where are you?</i>

770
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,046
I was on my way,
but something came up.

771
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,289
Like what? We're waiting for you.

772
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,121
By the way, my dad thinks
that restaurant is a great idea too.

773
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,331
Robert?
- I...

774
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,960
Can we meet in private
somewhere else?

775
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,604
I have to tell you something.

776
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,691
OK. Do I need to be worried?

777
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,567
I'll see you by the fountain
in front of the hotel, OK?

778
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,124
Was that Robert?
- Yes, he's on his way.

779
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,883
I have a job. I'm working on it.
I save everything I earn.

780
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,844
All I need is some time.

781
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,970
Just give me some time.

782
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,767
The last person who asked me for time
got eternity.

783
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,327
So how much time do you want,
Robertico?

784
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,806
I don't need a lot of time.

785
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,810
You're not the kind of person
who's satisfied with little.

786
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,764
Just look at your girlfriend.

787
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,008
Noëlla Maduro.
- She has nothing to do with it!

788
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,091
If you want it to remain that way,
make sure I get my money. Now.

789
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,648
OK, you'll get your money.
You'll get it.

790
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,771
So what's up?

791
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,964
Oh, nothing. Shall we go in?
- But you wanted to tell me something.

792
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,284
That you look stunning again today.

793
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,324
Come on.
- Weirdo.

794
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,045
Your dad's waiting.

795
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,890
There.

796
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,567
Robert, go ahead, I'd say.

797
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,489
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Ken.
Our pal here is a common con-artist.

798
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,402
What are you talking about?
- These people can explain some things.

799
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,443
Pieter-Joost, Hermelinde.
- I hope you're not planning...

800
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,281
...to do business with that fellow.
He almost scammed us out of thousands.

801
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,804
That villa on Curaçao didn't even belong
to him. It's nothing but a scam.

802
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,081
A scam?
- Yes.

803
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,523
There's no Bon Bini Bungalows.
There's no Bon Bini Business.

804
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,691
There's only Bon Bini Bullshit.
Even his name is a lie.

805
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,171
He's called Robertico Florentina.
Well-known to the police in Willemstad.

806
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,329
Is that true, Robert?

807
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,369
Robert?
- That's not his name.

808
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,244
I wasn't asking you.

809
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,885
Is it true?

810
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,766
Is it?
- Noëlla...

811
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,327
What's between us isn't a lie.
It's real.

812
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,920
You're not being serious...

813
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,368
I think you'd better go.

814
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,447
Florentina.

815
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,367
Hey bro, am I too late?

816
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,404
I'm taking care of it now.

817
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,491
I'll go and get it.

818
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,166
What? Hide?

819
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,170
No problem.

820
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,729
You can say what you want
about those Chinese...

821
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,604
...but at least they can cook.

822
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,486
I have two coupons,
so I'm getting a container of that shit.

823
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,570
Here he is.
Are we keeping our pants on today?

824
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,490
I think I made myself perfectly clear.

825
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,048
So don't get any ideas,
or you'll be waiting till hell freezes over.

826
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,481
Who's your fecking friend?
- We won't bother you again.

827
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,251
What?
Do you understand him?

828
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,886
We're leaving.
- Really? That can't be right.

829
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,527
Finally someone who's a good example.
Back to his own country.

830
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,041
It'll be peaceful there.
The rest of them are over here.

831
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,207
Ouch! Fuck!
- Hey, keep on working.

832
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,291
If you want to stay here, work.
You too.

833
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,608
Hey, do you guys want pussy?

834
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,601
Work, work.

835
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,205
Did you hear?

836
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,643
That deal with those Chinese is on.
- Bye, Patrick.

837
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,691
Hello, time to wake up!

838
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,123
You're not sleeping here for free.
Work!

839
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,526
You call this sewing?

840
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,490
Your mother is better at it.

841
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,204
Should I call her?

842
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,084
Mommy...

843
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,564
Get back to work.

844
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,244
What's Paomo?
- Paomo's the big boss. Go and work.

845
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,161
Which boss?
- He'll be angry if you don't work.

846
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,047
Listen, Ping Ping...
- Let go of me. Relax.

847
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,322
You want to know who Paomo is?

848
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,201
Triad.
- What?

849
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,961
Cartel. Underworld.
- What?

850
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,844
Organized crime.

851
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,281
What?
- Chinese mafia!

852
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,211
The Chinese mafia owns everything.

853
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,644
The sweatshop, hotel, restaurant.
Buy, buy, sell.

854
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,604
You have to help me.
- You pay me.

855
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,531
I really need your help.
- I really need your money.

856
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,882
Fuck the money.
- Fuck you.

857
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,721
You pay me, I'll help you.
- OK, I'll pay you...

858
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,049
...but you have to help me now.
- Deal.

859
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,806
Do we have a break?
- No. Finish these pants, asshole!

860
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,881
Well, Ken...

861
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,801
it's been back and forth five times.
The interpreter checked everything.

862
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,843
So don't worry.

863
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,164
There you go.

864
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,685
Go ahead.

865
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,165
Mr. Paomo apologizes...

866
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,570
...for the interruption,
but he didn't want to miss this moment.

867
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,402
But weren't you going over there?
- I was.

868
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,126
That was the case, indeed.

869
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,405
Mr. Paomo is happy to be present.

870
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,521
Very happy.

871
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,764
May I introduce you
to my daughter Noëlla.

872
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,842
And you know Patrick, of course.

873
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,931
Right, Mr...

874
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,485
...Paomo.

875
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,126
Mr. Paomo looks different, though.

876
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,446
A lot younger.

877
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,965
Mr. Paomo thinks you look
very different as well.

878
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,969
A lot uglier.

879
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,931
He's very funny.
He likes making jokes.

880
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,846
Let's do business.

881
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,407
Good.

882
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,682
And there.

883
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,967
What's keeping him?

884
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,441
Ken, wait, wait!
- Robert?

885
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,610
Here, read this.
Read who Paomo really is.

886
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,201
You'll lose everything.
It's a fake contract.

887
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,721
You're a fake yourself,
Mr. Bon Bini Bullshit.

888
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:06,167
Please, Ken, trust me.
Don't do it.

889
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:11,210
Believe me, 'Paomo' just means 'bubble'.
It's all fake.

890
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,688
He works with the Chinese mafia.
- This is going too far.

891
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,123
Don't listen to that con-artist.
- Have your lawyers check it out.

892
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,641
Perhaps you should have it checked out.
- Yes, check.

893
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,365
Just to make sure.

894
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,325
You're taking his side too? Cunt!

895
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,124
Patrick, calm down.

896
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,406
He's done. The deal is off.
Mr. Paomo...

897
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,729
He isn't Mr. Paomo at all!

898
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,611
Anyway...

899
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,682
it doesn't matter,
because you already signed.

900
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,646
I'm going to Hong Kong right now
to close that deal.

901
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:03,201
Out of my way, slob.
- I'm a slob? You're a slob.

902
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,686
Coffee!
- Yes?

903
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,131
Stop!

904
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,291
Stop!

905
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,848
You're not thinking of running away again,
are you?

906
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:48,803
Good for you. This will teach you
not to touch other people's stuff.

907
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,445
With your grave digger face.

908
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,290
Who are you calling Shin Shin?

909
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,881
Do I look Chinese? Look at my face.

910
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,242
Ever seen a Chinese with lovely fat lips
like this?

911
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,522
You saved my company.
- I didn't do anything.

912
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,087
You should thank that nephew of mine.
- Robert?

913
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,205
His name is Robertico.
That boy is madly in love with you.

914
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,291
I don't get it, though. I look at your face
and I think: uggh.

915
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,811
Where is Robert, by the way?

916
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,129
I'll work in the mornings. Come on.
I'll work at FC Chicken.

917
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,607
I'll work in the sweatshop
or take a paper route.

918
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,007
I can do all sorts of things.
I can walk your dog.

919
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,726
Come on, let me walk your dog.
- I don't have a dog.

920
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,083
OK, your parakeet. Your grandma.
Let me walk your grandma.

921
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,762
Eddie, come on.
- How many limbs did you have again?

922
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,851
Eddie, no. Please.
- Eenie, meenie...

923
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,884
...miney...
- Hey, Mr. Rude!

924
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,409
Immigration wants me dead.

925
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,524
Dear Father, please. If you rescue me
from this situation...

926
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,690
...I'll never be aggressive again.
To no one!

927
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,000
Hare Krishna, Allah,
I don't know who you are...

928
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,441
What! You want to shoot my weave?

929
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,243
You want to shoot us?

930
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,204
Happy New Year, assholes!

931
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,362
Flying Dragon!

932
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,641
There's more shooting here
than in my own country.

933
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,047
Two more rats.

934
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,326
Drop your weapon.
- You drop your weapon.

935
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,171
You drop your weapon.
- You drop your weapon.

936
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,601
You drop your weapon.
- Drop your weapon.

937
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,486
This isn't a 'drop your weapon' game!
Drop your weapon.

938
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,285
You sneakily tried to shoot me?
Rude!

939
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:02,169
Let's solve this in a civilized manner.
- Oh, now you want to be civilized!

940
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,727
He ran out of bullets
and now he wants...

941
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,243
Just a moment, OK?

942
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:16,170
One moment. You want to solve this
in a civilized manner and hit me?

943
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,442
Kofi, hold on to my hair.

944
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,130
<i>Ni hao,</i> bitch.
With your grave digger face.

945
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,527
Bullshit. Get lost, idiot.

946
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,404
I'm going to do my nails.
I'm done.

947
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,922
I've got a headache and my period.
I don't have to put up with this.

948
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,169
I want a raise.
All that hassle all the time.

949
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,569
ONE YEAR LATER

950
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,169
Pieter-Joost and Hermelinde!

951
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,449
Two Karni Stoba.

952
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,890
Is it good, mom?

953
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:51,643
Man, you'll never believe
what just happened to me.

954
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,446
I'm at the elevator and it opens...

955
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:58,565
...and there was suddenly
a huge African in front of me.

956
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,890
Stark naked! I didn't know
where to look, it wasn't normal.

957
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,003
He looked at me, he wanted me.

958
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,761
Robertico, I have
a special offer for you.

959
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,282
A special green viagra.
Nice and hard.

960
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,767
You'll get a big horse dick.

961
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,367
I want to do things to you. Nice things...
- I don't want you.

962
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,042
...naughty things, blessed
boom boom things, sister.

963
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,730
Want to taste?
- Taste what?

964
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,729
Black coffee.

965
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,090
Yes? Did you call me?

966
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:38,810
He wanted me. I was his prey
and I said: Forget it, pal. No way.

967
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,002
I was wearing
that nice cat sweater.

968
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,771
He probably thought
I was Victoria Secret.

969
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,281
I said: I'll make you work,
but you can't.

970
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,089
Went to see a movie yesterday.

971
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,089
The one with that Jandino.

972
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:22,645
Boy-oh-boy. Well... I'm afraid
that's not going to be it either.

973
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,487
Those guys don't work?
Rahjesh doesn't work.
