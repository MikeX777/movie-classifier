1
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,007
Seek those things that are above...

2
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,813
not those things
that are upon the Earth.

3
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,777
Brothers and sisters...

4
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,149
every day I hear
a grumbling against God.

5
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,447
Times are hard.

6
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,056
The times are bad.

7
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,784
Grievous times.

8
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,395
And that they are.

9
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,168
But let us not forget...

10
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,433
the words of the Apostle
in his letter to the Romans.

11
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:35,642
"The sufferings of this present time

12
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,649
"are not to be compared
with the future glory,

13
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,148
"the glory that shall
be revealed in us."

14
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,662
Indeed, brothers and sisters,
I would go further.

15
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:56,058
I would go further and say
that this life simply has to be harsh...

16
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,104
to stop Earthly happiness
being loved.

17
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:11,778
It is essential that this life
be troubled so that the other life...

18
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,110
Right now it is still dark.

19
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,287
You cannot see God yet...

20
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,453
or hold in your hands...

21
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,422
all that he has promised you.

22
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,406
But do not despair. Trust in him.

23
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,278
Hope.

24
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,117
Hope in him.

25
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,085
You will not be disappointed.

26
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,723
Tribulation produces patience.

27
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,288
Patience passes the test.

28
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,258
Passing the test gives us hope.

29
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,130
While hope...

30
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,228
Hope does not disappoint.

31
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,275
So the other life may be light.

32
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,181
Seek those things that are above...

33
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,052
not those things
that are upon the Earth.

34
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,524
Straw, Springer...

35
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,763
look away.

36
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,472
Look away.

37
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,209
I just like to announce the moment.

38
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,612
- OK, OK.
- It's all right.

39
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:45,321
All right, Brendan, God be with you.

40
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,490
Hey!

41
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,220
What's that?

42
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,570
Robber scum skulking
in the bushes, eh?

43
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,074
- Where are the others? Up ahead?
- I'm alone!

44
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,769
- Yes!
- I'm alone!

45
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,982
Stephen!

46
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:59,691
In these times, what kind of fool
travels the road alone?

47
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm a laborer out of bond. I left
my master's land without a license.

48
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,762
He's lying.

49
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,101
Oh, God, please.

50
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,107
- Speak up.
- Please don't.

51
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,213
Or shall we loosen
your tongue with a knife?

52
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,374
Listen, let me go.
I promise I won't say what I saw.

53
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,316
What? What did you see?

54
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,484
I saw a merchant
dragged from his cart.

55
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,754
Aye, now we are the brigands.

56
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,130
Your clothes.

57
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,030
Our costumes, worn against the cold.

58
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,227
- Costumes?
- We're actors.

59
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,074
Traveling actors.

60
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,305
And here's our badge of livery.

61
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,106
We're Lord Robert Sanville's company.

62
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,272
- Martin?
- He's no brigand.

63
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,577
I saw you kill a man.

64
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:59,757
Brendan was my father,
our father and our leader.

65
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,721
He's been ill for many months.

66
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:06,122
A canker of the belly.
He begged us to end his pain.

67
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,203
The hands of a laborer?

68
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,242
I don't think so.

69
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,356
Come on. This bloody axle!

70
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,057
It's getting worse.

71
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,129
We'll find a cartwright
in the next town.

72
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,129
What do we pay him with?

73
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,563
We've not even got enough
to bury Brendan.

74
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,430
Then we'll perform.

75
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,612
Where are you headed?

76
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,119
North to Durham,
to perform for our lord's cousin.

77
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,485
That's all we are, a Christmas gift
from one noble family to another.

78
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,320
Come on!

79
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,089
- Can I come with you?
- No!

80
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,683
Hello!

81
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,124
I want to join your troupe.

82
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,764
You know you're short an actor.
I could learn.

83
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,509
No one could ever
replace Brendan. No one.

84
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,111
Well, I wouldn't try and replace him,
just plug the hole he left behind.

85
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,975
Whoa.

86
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,280
Plug the hole he left behind?

87
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,182
All right, let's see what you can do.

88
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,988
I know, be a bird.

89
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,130
- Be a what?
- A bird. Be a bird.

90
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,731
How about if we try a heron?

91
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,500
A big gangling lad like you.

92
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,273
Aye, that's it.
But now on one leg.

93
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,038
Hop. Move, move.

94
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,212
Not around in circles. Go that way.

95
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,573
Godspeed, stranger.

96
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,284
He's right. With Brendan gone,
our parts will have to change.

97
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,453
We need someone
to play the minor roles.

98
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,225
Attendant Angel, Devil's Fool.

99
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:59,495
You're the fool, Marty.
We don't even know who he is.

100
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,502
Halt.

101
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,637
- We'll vote on it.
- What?

102
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,506
As our leader, I'm calling a vote.

103
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,242
Springer?

104
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,547
Oh, well, there's a surprise.
I'm against it.

105
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,692
Need you ask?

106
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,394
Straw?

107
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,628
Well, I've never seen a heron like it.

108
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,434
I'm with you.

109
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,403
Welcome.

110
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,012
I know what you're doing.

111
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,194
Come on.

112
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,669
Where to now?

113
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,474
We head west.

114
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,010
And why not east?

115
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,538
Fenland's impassible.

116
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,581
And towards the west?

117
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,089
I don't know, Tobias,
I've never been there.

118
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,816
Hey, hey, whoa.

119
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,332
Whoa. Whoa!

120
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,033
So where is everyone?

121
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,539
Hello?

122
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,504
- There's no one here.
- We'll head up this way.

123
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,412
Get. Get.

124
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,352
Get, get, get, get, get.

125
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,032
Hey, hey, hey, come on! Come on.

126
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,728
- Yeah, yeah.
- Come on.

127
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,734
Come here. Come here, you.

128
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,701
You're useless!

129
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,647
Whoa.

130
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,211
How many can say
they've walked their roads

131
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,016
and wet their fields without fear?

132
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,687
Sleep safe in their beds at night,
their bellies full?

133
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,662
If we can, it is because
each man plays his part in it.

134
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,068
There can be no exceptions.

135
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,478
For his vigilance in this affair,

136
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:33,175
the court is beholden
to Brother Simon Damian,

137
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,719
confessor to our noble lord,
Robert de Guise...

138
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,394
from whom this court
draws the power to dispense justice

139
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,123
according to the laws of the land.

140
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:52,499
After due deliberation of the facts
and circumstances of this case,

141
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:58,472
it is our finding that the accused
is guilty as charged.

142
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,246
It is the sentence of this court
that you be hanged by the neck

143
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,114
and your body drawn
until you are dead.

144
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,124
And may God have mercy on your soul.

145
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,575
- What was her crime?
- Murder.

146
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,077
Young Thomas Wells.

147
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,115
Sixpence for this?

148
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,261
For the use of the yard, twopence
on every shilling taken at the gate.

149
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,657
Twopence?

150
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,294
It's the Feast of Saint Lazarus
tomorrow.

151
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,763
There'll be plenty other minstrels
happy to pay the price.

152
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,199
We're not some band
of minstrels. We're actors.

153
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,932
Actors, minstrels or scoundrels,
it's a share of the purse.

154
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,076
We'll take it.

155
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,440
When I think of the respect
our profession used to command...

156
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:35,105
One, two, three. Pull!

157
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,673
- Sorry, Martin.
- Straw.

158
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,270
- Come on, Straw.
- Get the head.

159
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,673
- Get it in front, Straw.
- Get it.

160
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,207
- Get the head.
- I'm trying.

161
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,009
- Keep him covered. Quickly.
- Hold him up, Straw.

162
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,742
- To the barn.
- Hold him up.

163
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,617
- That's right, hold him up.
- Which way, Martin?

164
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,654
- To the right.
- To the right.

165
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,292
He's not stiff anymore.

166
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,657
That's what happens after a day
and a night have passed.

167
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,555
Cover him up, Stephen.

168
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,169
Stephen, cover him up.

169
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,564
You know a lot about death.

170
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,275
- So does Stephen.
- Stephen was a soldier.

171
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,208
This one doesn't strike me
as a veteran of any war.

172
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,246
The first plague hit my village hard.

173
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,783
Those of us who were spared
saw to those of us who weren't.

174
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,724
He's a liar.
That fucking lad is a liar.

175
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,391
Again.

176
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,395
That's it.

177
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,670
Tobias is right, we need a cartwright.

178
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:19,726
Good people, we give you our play
of Adam and Eve.

179
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:28,340
We pray you, give your ears and eyes.
See Eden lost by Satan's lies.

180
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:35,513
How woman led her man to fall
from holy grace and with him, all.

181
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:42,317
I, God, great in majesty,

182
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:46,828
in whom no first or last can be.

183
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:54,261
Heaven and Earth are made through me.

184
00:22:54,473 --> 00:23:00,241
And at my bidding now be light.

185
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,221
With breath and body...

186
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,292
him to bless,

187
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,728
above all creatures...

188
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,531
both great and less.

189
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:34,609
The serpent came with song...

190
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:42,247
and smile, but Adam slept,
free from his wiles.

191
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,785
And while he slumbered, thus alone,

192
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,322
I drew from him a single bone...

193
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,496
and fashioned forth a human mate...

194
00:23:55,734 --> 00:24:02,037
that mankind might itself cre...

195
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,672
Create.

196
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,616
Ghostly paradise I was in.

197
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:20,014
But thence I fell,
and through my sin,

198
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,286
Earthly Paradise, my God's gift,

199
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,362
men and women dwell within.

200
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,491
I have tried my all, but in vain,

201
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:35,332
by my wiles to bring them pain.

202
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,578
By my wiles to bring them pain.

203
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,783
By my wiles to bring them pain!

204
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:50,486
Or must I say that line again?

205
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:58,051
If the world belong to thee,
lord of all things thou wouldst be.

206
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,754
If the world belonged to me,

207
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:06,163
women all would ready be
to harken to the devil!

208
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,038
I'm... I'm sorry.

209
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,040
Two measly shillings.

210
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,581
We used to make ten.

211
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,117
Not exactly a fortune, is it?

212
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,779
Well, it is enough to bury Brendan
and be on our way.

213
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,989
Oh, Brendan, Brendan.

214
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,560
Who would have thought
he would end up in this hellhole?

215
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,664
Father?

216
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,531
Father?

217
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,762
We'd like to have a word with you.

218
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,235
There's a friend of ours
we'd like to have buried.

219
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,274
Dead, I trust?

220
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:55,043
As you can see,
we're a little busy here.

221
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,118
A child's grave.

222
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,658
Thomas Wells.

223
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,523
- Come now.
- The boy murdered by the woman?

224
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:12,261
Aye. She strangled him.

225
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,995
Yeah.

226
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,105
- Six shillings.
- Six?

227
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,038
Six.

228
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,213
Six shillings.

229
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,513
Are you, by any chance,
related to the innkeeper?

230
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,553
I am not some tinker
to be bartered with.

231
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:49,574
We'll bury him in a wood out of town.

232
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,266
I promised him hallowed ground.

233
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,469
We have no choice, Martin.

234
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,782
- You understand?
- What kind of God

235
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,678
inflicts such suffering
on his loyal servant?

236
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,113
Or, indeed, his own son?

237
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,150
- Amen.
- Amen.

238
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,982
Goodbye, old friend.

239
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,624
- Nicholas, thank you.
- Thank you.

240
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,784
Thank you, Father.

241
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,668
- It's just you, a priest.
- Martin, please.

242
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,198
What did you do?

243
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,999
A priest on the road,
traveling incognito.

244
00:27:56,374 --> 00:28:00,504
- A man's secrets are his own, Tobias.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

245
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,670
I should tell.

246
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,047
I lay with a woman from my village...

247
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,576
another man's wife.

248
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,624
I thought that went with the job.

249
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,623
- Enough said, I think.
- No, no, no, no, no.

250
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,844
I want to know every
sordid little detail.

251
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:20,727
Get off. Get off of me.

252
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,968
- It's been so long.
- You're the devil, my guest.

253
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,783
Stay.

254
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,441
What are you really running from?

255
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,076
I see it in you.

256
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,976
Not the woman.

257
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,246
Some darker secret.

258
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,499
As long as you're with us...

259
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,294
you force us to carry it too.

260
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,458
Where will you go?

261
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,266
- The traveler's friend.
- Saint Christopher.

262
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:21,602
It was my mother's,
and her mother's before her.

263
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,644
Where is she now?

264
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,044
Plague.

265
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,780
- Who did you lose?
- A sister.

266
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,150
I begged to be taken with her.

267
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,618
And God had another purpose for you?

268
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,498
I think he's given up
hope on me by now.

269
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:53,371
Without you, a good man would not
have received the burial he deserved.

270
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,279
You've earned our thanks, I daresay.
Our friendship will follow.

271
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,544
It may not be much...

272
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,453
but it's more than lies out there.

273
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,124
Nicholas, would you have paid

274
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,634
good money to have seen
our play last night?

275
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,697
You're not alone.

276
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,043
No one comes to see us anymore.

277
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,747
Our purse is always empty, our stomachs rarely full.

278
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,548
In Wakefield and York
the guilds put on cycles

279
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,346
of all of the mysteries in a week,
everything from the fall of Lucifer

280
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,352
to the Day of Judgment.

281
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:42,425
In Coventry, I saw Christ
resurrected from the tomb,

282
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:46,359
hoisted up to the heavens
on a cord not visible to the eye.

283
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,726
- How can we match them?
- You can't.

284
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,795
Not unless we change our stories.

285
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,365
You can't change stories,
they're written in the Bible.

286
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,598
I'm talking about new stories.
Ask yourself:

287
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,777
What matters more
to the people of this town,

288
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,241
Eve's temptation of Adam,
or the murder of a young boy

289
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,211
who's lived among them for years?

290
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:12,144
- Feast of Saint Lazarus.
- Bad day for pigs.

291
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:17,126
- I'll settle up with the cartwright.
- Martin?

292
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,222
It's a gift.

293
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,483
That ass-faced innkeeper
and his poisonous ale,

294
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,551
I'll be glad to see
the back of both of them.

295
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,212
Bad news.
The axle can't be repaired.

296
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,291
It has to be replaced.

297
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,394
- How much?
- We must perform again.

298
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,759
I can barely stand upright,
let alone prance about a yard on stilts.

299
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,430
You may not have to.

300
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,194
I have a proposal.

301
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,662
We change our play.

302
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,270
Oh, please, please, not the Crucifixion.
All that hollering.

303
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,736
A new play.

304
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:10,070
A play about greed,
temptation and mortal sin.

305
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,739
A tale in which virtue and vice contend
for the soul of a young woman,

306
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,450
and justice prevails as she must.

307
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,013
- Thomas Wells?
- Thomas who?

308
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,248
He's the young lad
who sleeps beneath Brendan.

309
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,155
- I knew it.
- The one that girl murdered.

310
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,023
Who dares play things
that happen in this world?

311
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,664
It was just a question of time.

312
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,661
I believe this is the way plays
will be made in times to come.

313
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,196
So you've been saying for years.

314
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,531
But what did your father
think of your ideas?

315
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,773
By naming me as his successor,
I believe he was condoning them.

316
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,044
- Lies! Lies, Martin.
- Even at the last.

317
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,475
Lies, and you know it.

318
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,643
Your father'd turn in his grave
if he could hear you now.

319
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,252
I don't know about that.
It's a tight fit in there.

320
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,389
Martin, it's just a killing.

321
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,117
So was Cain and Abel,
and we've played it often.

322
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,090
Cain and Abel is in the Bible.

323
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,327
God has not revealed to us
the meaning of this story.

324
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,525
So much of God's meaning
remains hidden to us.

325
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:09,338
Why does he visit blights upon
our crops, plagues upon our people?

326
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,475
The priests spout empty words
from the pulpit,

327
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:16,977
but we can show the people
God's hand at work

328
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,116
with real stories,

329
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,114
in events that touch us directly.

330
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,311
- Why did she kill him?
- You've no voice in this.

331
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,147
But I have.

332
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,057
Greed. The boy was carrying
his father's purse at the time.

333
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,027
She lured him off the road,
then strangled him.

334
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,530
Then the road is the way of life.

335
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,361
- The path of righteousness.
- Yes.

336
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:42,572
And by turning aside for temptation,
the boy found death lurking for him.

337
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,764
Don't you see?
It's a morality play.

338
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,576
Only the figures are different.

339
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,178
So where are the words for this play?

340
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,441
We can do it in mime,

341
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,812
speak words as we think them.

342
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,619
Tobias?

343
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,491
The minds of men may change...

344
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,752
but we have no authority
from God on this.

345
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,620
- I'm still against it.
- So am I.

346
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,125
Well, why not?

347
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,701
We are stuck here till tomorrow,
like it or not.

348
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,694
Springer?

349
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,242
Three for, two against.

350
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,407
The deciding vote is yours.

351
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,379
An equal split
goes against the proposal.

352
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:31,386
Remember, you're a priest.
God hasn't given us this story to use.

353
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,288
No.

354
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,787
But he is everywhere,

355
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,393
even in this story.

356
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,693
Martin's right, it's for us to find him.

357
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,532
Just as I thought.

358
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,204
An ally to swing the vote your way.

359
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,309
We'll perform this afternoon...

360
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,006
and use the morning to find out
more of what happened.

361
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,387
- Jack Flint?
- Yeah?

362
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,554
You're the man who found
the body of Thomas Wells.

363
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,533
Are you from the castle?
Because I've already...

364
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,999
No, I'm a player. We plan to
tell the story of the killing.

365
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,746
Worse than I feared.

366
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,554
De Rougement.

367
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,247
Ampleforth, even Vilius.

368
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,458
Martin!

369
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,607
Martin?

370
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,079
- Where are you going?
- What did you find out?

371
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,455
Nothing. He wouldn't speak to me.
No one would.

372
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,214
It's a feast day.

373
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,586
They've got other things
to think about.

374
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,352
Come on.

375
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,002
- Half a shilling?
- See into her heart.

376
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,230
The heart of our play.

377
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,671
In.

378
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,744
- Did you hear?
- Who are these people?

379
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,313
Guests of Lord de Guise.
There's one who left his lands

380
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:18,114
to work for another.
Another who preached dissent!

381
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:37,071
It was he that gave me the money.
You can stay here and watch.

382
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,770
Hey.

383
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,546
Beware her touch.

384
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:47,275
They say she has the power.

385
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,589
- What power?
- Well,

386
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,555
you've paid dear for the pleasure
of hearing your own crowing.

387
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,286
She's deaf and dumb!

388
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,113
My name is Martin.

389
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,046
That's Nicholas.

390
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,278
We're players.

391
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,392
What am I doing?
She can't hear.

392
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,756
Look.

393
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,264
You can see my words?

394
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,477
We're to tell your story on our stage.

395
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,264
Why did you do it?

396
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,607
What possessed you?

397
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,081
A young boy, a child.

398
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,767
The monk saw you
near the woods at dusk.

399
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,576
He's lying. Why?

400
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:02,376
But the sheriff and his men
found the boy's purse in your house.

401
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,033
The monk. The one at the trial?

402
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,363
That... That monk?

403
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,152
Purse.

404
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,623
The monk's purse.

405
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,063
The boy's purse.

406
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,795
The monk...

407
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,163
grabbed the boy's purse...

408
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,143
and hid it under your bed.

409
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,744
You saw him do this?

410
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,316
You weren't there?

411
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,787
So the...
The monk was with them...

412
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,263
when they searched your house?

413
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,475
And they arrested you
when you returned.

414
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,808
Silence in there!

415
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,630
You didn't do it.

416
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,592
Got it.

417
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,693
She didn't do it.
She wasn't even there.

418
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,504
So she says. So would you.

419
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,098
- She wasn't there.
- What would you have us do?

420
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,403
Declare her innocent based on
a few snatches of mime?

421
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,773
You're a player, a master player.
You know how to read people.

422
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,706
Tell me she was lying.
Look at me.

423
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,018
For heaven sakes, man,
we're actors, not judges.

424
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,551
Well, that's exactly
what we have become.

425
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,155
Just tell me she was lying.

426
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,389
Look at me.

427
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,353
I'll hear no more of this.

428
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,315
&

429
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,241
Right.

430
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,146
The lad went with his family

431
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,483
to a village just near here
to sell his horse.

432
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,592
- It was a cow.
- A horse, a cow, it doesn't matter.

433
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,321
The point is, his father
went straight to the nearest alehouse

434
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,130
with the money, to drink it all away.

435
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,290
- And he would have done so...
- If his wife

436
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,993
hadn't slipped it to Thomas,
sending him home with it.

437
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,334
Which is why he was on the road.
It's why he got strangled.

438
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,590
Yes, all right, we
know the rest of it.

439
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:21,672
Good work, Springer.

440
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,208
We'll open with the alehouse.

441
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,708
Tobias, set up the table here.

442
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,577
Stephen, you play the drunken father.

443
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,780
Straw, you'll have to double.

444
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,558
You'll play both
the mother and the woman.

445
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,093
Her name is Martha.

446
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,629
And you, Nicholas,
shall be Good Counsel,

447
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,097
urging Thomas to stay on the path,

448
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,392
the way of life.

449
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,536
Right. Right, where should we
start from?

450
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,676
From over there.

451
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,312
&

452
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,984
What troubles you?

453
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,255
Ask your brother.

454
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,523
You're free to leave.

455
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,136
If I do, does my precious vote
go with me?

456
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:26,203
I will put on this play
with or without you.

457
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,441
The first are arriving.

458
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,513
Sarah.

459
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:36,085
- Well, take your place.
- Thank you.

460
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,152
Thank you.

461
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,358
Hey.

462
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,006
Thank you.

463
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,652
Tobias.

464
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,736
Good masters!

465
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,604
- We beg your patience.
- Yes, sir.

466
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,780
And also to give
good audience to our play,

467
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,053
which is also yours.

468
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,384
It's a new thing to make a play
that belongs to a town,

469
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,616
and this play does honor
to your town, for it shows

470
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,360
that wrongdoers are punished here

471
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,555
with great speed of justice.

472
00:48:56,667 --> 00:49:01,001
Gentle people, we give you our play

473
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:04,299
of Thomas Wells.

474
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,647
The family have just sold their cow.

475
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:16,343
Their purse is full.

476
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,955
They pass an alehouse.

477
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,017
He tries in vain for half a day,

478
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,383
to drink that precious purse away.

479
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,502
Are you ready?

480
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,803
- As daylight fades, so does he.
- Straw, take the purse.

481
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,681
For his wife, an opportunity.

482
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,279
Each and every man
to keep well upon...

483
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,749
Take it now, Straw.

484
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,790
The purse recovered, she must stay,

485
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,227
and so dispatches Thomas on his way.

486
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:44,640
Of Christ, Good Counsel is my name.

487
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,514
The shadows lengthen,

488
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,376
night draws ever near,

489
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:57,179
- he's tired and cold,
- Martin.

490
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,118
His young heart gripped by fear.

491
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,526
He quickens his pace,

492
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,219
still clutching his precious load,

493
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,995
- recalling the words of...
- Straw needs more time.

494
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,566
Pas de deux as best you can.

495
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,364
Use your Latin.
You never know.

496
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,569
- Go on.
- Good Counsel is my name,

497
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,572
and some call me Conscience.

498
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,577
- My task it is...
- Come on, come on, come on.

499
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,114
- Head.
- Come on.

500
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:32,582
To urge each and every man
to keep well upon the way of life.

501
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,221
Which path was opened to us

502
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:39,362
by the sufferings of Christ.

503
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:41,464
&

504
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,632
Come on, come on, come on.

505
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:49,363
Heed well my words, Thomas,
for as everyone here is aware,

506
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,666
it's in the contrary nature
of the young

507
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,106
to be drawn to the very thing

508
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:55,676
from which they are warned,

509
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,337
- convinced that their elders conspire
- It's a disaster.

510
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,982
To keep some...

511
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,780
hidden fruit that must be tasted.

512
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,814
Sin, in the beginning,
may seem full sweet,

513
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,141
but the reckoning comes,
be you never so fleet.

514
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,377
The die is cast,

515
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,772
- his fate now sealed,
- It wasn't like that!

516
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:10,985
- As Thomas to temptation yields.
- No. No.

517
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,084
- What did you say?
- My Thomas was a good boy.

518
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,452
Too young to know who holds his hand,

519
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:22,325
- I know my son, I know him.
- And draws him to the shady land.

520
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,694
He wouldn't have gone with her,
I tell you.

521
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,630
- I'm sorry.
- He wouldn't have gone with her.

522
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,038
He wouldn't have gone with her,
I tell you.

523
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,107
- I'm sorry.
- His mother should know.

524
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,274
- The Reaper,
- Martin.

525
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,416
- In a guise so sweet.
- But he must have gone with her.

526
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,076
His body was found in the woods.
She wasn't strong enough to carry him.

527
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,347
No, not strong enough
to wring his neck, neither.

528
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,084
- Well, now, he was just a boy.
- Big beyond his years, he was.

529
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,792
And strong as an ox.

530
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,310
Get me the sheriff! Now!

531
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,748
Get off the stage.
Get off. That's it.

532
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,248
Please! Quiet!

533
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,789
Quiet! Maybe she hit him
before strangling him!

534
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,094
No! There were no marks
on the body! Just his neck!

535
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,595
- Yes.
- That's what I heard from Jack Flint.

536
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,995
The man who found the body?

537
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,135
He's the only one
to have seen the boy dead.

538
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,703
Even his own mother
weren't allowed to see him!

539
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,233
Is this true?

540
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,568
A mother has a right
to see her own son.

541
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:47,014
Is this how you repay
the charity of your lord?

542
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,242
The man who gave your son
a proper burial?

543
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,210
Clear the yard!

544
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,788
Come on! Clear the yard!

545
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,590
Let's go.

546
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,217
Clear the yard.

547
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:07,191
- Get word to the Lord de Guise.
- Show us a play about the other boys.

548
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,700
- What other boys?
- Get a move on!

549
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,735
- Out of this square.
- There were other boys?

550
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:15,704
Four in a year.
Disappeared without trace.

551
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,447
Come on, come on!

552
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,730
- Never seen anything like it.
- Neither have I.

553
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,405
You wanted meaning...

554
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,711
you got chaos.

555
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,641
- He got truth.
- Gossip.

556
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,455
Sunrise finds you
on the road or in my jail.

557
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,454
The axle's broke.
It won't be ready in time.

558
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,685
Your axle, boy, was ready this morning
at first light, as well you know.

559
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:11,097
It's only by the grace of Lord de Guise
that you lot still have your freedom.

560
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,258
Sunrise.

561
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,536
You lied to us.

562
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:23,102
A broken axle,
just to put on your play.

563
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,973
Master player?

564
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,778
You're not worthy
of your father's title.

565
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:49,531
&

566
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,529
Forgive me.

567
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,099
Grave robbery.

568
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,304
That's a capital offense.

569
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,282
Help him dig.

570
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,294
That's not a boy.

571
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,197
It's a man, my lord.

572
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,372
It's a friend of ours that we
buried here just to save expense.

573
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,542
And who performed the service?

574
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,706
I did.

575
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,516
Priest...

576
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,618
turned player.

577
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,357
Take him out.

578
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,030
Well, uncover him.

579
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,464
That's why you came here,
to examine him,

580
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,832
see what his parents
were prevented from seeing, yes?

581
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,240
Do as the king's justice says.

582
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,376
The king's justice?

583
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,079
Uncover him.

584
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,492
Remove his robe.

585
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,809
Nothing.

586
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,110
Except the bruising at the neck.

587
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,424
Bite marks.

588
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,364
Yes.

589
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,084
Oh, God.

590
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,081
Oh, God.

591
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,604
- Oh, Christ!
- What? What is it?

592
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,173
A swelling, in the pit of his arm.

593
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,483
If he hadn't been killed,
the plague would have taken him.

594
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,387
It's all right, there's no danger.
He's three days dead.

595
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,294
There's no danger. Help me.

596
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,624
Help me.

597
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:09,179
You'd be wise to move on
with your friends.

598
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:10,717
Are they gonna hang her?

599
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,453
She's innocent.
No woman could have done this.

600
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,090
Are they gonna hang her?

601
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:19,627
And you, too, if you reveal
what you've done here tonight.

602
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,566
What does the king's justice
want with a dead peasant boy?

603
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,576
I'm sorry.

604
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,405
I'm sorry.

605
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:41,775
I'm sorry.

606
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,224
The sun isn't up.

607
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:57,196
They waited as long as the dead,
then they left by the north gate.

608
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,357
You might just make it.

609
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,701
Jesus!

610
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:13,373
- You mean you dug Brendan up?
- I had to, to get to the boy.

611
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,085
He'd been violated.

612
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,989
She didn't do it. She couldn't have.
We have to help.

613
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,154
- How?
- And why?

614
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:32,994
You said yourself the king's justice
has shown some interest.

615
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:37,097
Martin, you gave her hope.

616
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:40,673
You gave her hope!

617
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,807
- You can't walk away.
- Why are you doing this?

618
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,210
I got no choice!

619
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,118
I have nothing else to lose.

620
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,413
Except your life.

621
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:56,352
It's just a matter of time
before they find me and hang me.

622
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,551
What, for bedding another man's wife?

623
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,003
Martin?

624
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,535
Come back with me.

625
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,475
Oh, Christ, Martin. Come back.

626
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,213
Please.

627
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,283
How much were you paid?

628
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,016
- What?
- How much were you paid?

629
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,455
I don't know what
you're talking about!

630
01:06:35,456 --> 01:06:36,319
How much?

631
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,722
I found the boy and I brought
him back, that's all.

632
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,529
He'd been missing for two days!

633
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,724
Found him in the clearing,
by the big oak!

634
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:49,333
I thought he was asleep, resting,
and then I saw the marks on his neck!

635
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,030
- What were you doing there?
- I was collecting firewood.

636
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,209
I'm a potter, you can ask anyone!

637
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,675
And then I loaded him onto the horse,
and that wasn't easy

638
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,413
- because he was stiff as a board!
- He was what?

639
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,482
He was stiff!

640
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,709
But he'd been dead two days.

641
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:06,044
Well, so what?

642
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,425
Rigor mortis?

643
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:26,173
Come on.

644
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:29,535
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

645
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,450
Whoa.

646
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,474
I wish I were half the man
my father was...

647
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,445
and half the father you deserve.

648
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,136
I shall see you all in Durham!

649
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,729
I went to the jail to see your daughter.

650
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,271
I have no daughter.

651
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:11,713
You don't care
that she's to hang tonight?

652
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,483
It is God's will.

653
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,276
But she's innocent.

654
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,289
No one is innocent.

655
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,254
Then what's her sin?

656
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,290
For it wasn't murder.

657
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,620
Blasphemy.

658
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:33,294
She lays on hands and claims
that God himself speaks through them.

659
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:34,766
She's a healer?

660
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,638
God is the only healer.

661
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,703
Man's nature is corrupt.

662
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,372
It has been since the fall of Eden.

663
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,481
We can be redeemed,

664
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,618
but God is to be found nowhere
in ourselves

665
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:51,480
as she and her followers claim.

666
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,088
What followers?

667
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,287
Who are you that brings a message
from my daughter...

668
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:03,260
yet knows nothing of her repute
in these parts?

669
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:08,102
She's scared.

670
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,532
I warned her.

671
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:18,736
Warned her they would find a way
to bring her before the judges.

672
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,810
- They always do.
- Who?

673
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:24,210
The monk? The Benedictine?

674
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:28,421
A minister of hell, Simon Damian.

675
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,185
The lord he serves, the judge.

676
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,486
They are as one.

677
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,530
And as one,
they will face the flames...

678
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:43,661
with their hounds, their horses,
and their whores...

679
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:47,400
that they feed and clothe
from the blood we sweat.

680
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,804
You talk of divine justice.

681
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,148
What of human justice?

682
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:58,619
You're not from these parts, are you?

683
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:04,351
Else you would know,
those who seek justice...

684
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,153
fall prey to it.

685
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:49,504
&

686
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,710
Father?

687
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:10,014
There is a brother of yours
who wishes to speak with you.

688
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,490
Well, have him come in.

689
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:43,019
I know that the woman
didn't kill Thomas Wells.

690
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,420
She wasn't even there
the night he died.

691
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,296
What is that to me?

692
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:03,609
I've seen the body.

693
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,604
Wounds no woman could have inflicted.

694
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,609
No, the body is buried.

695
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,148
Was...

696
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,454
and is once more.

697
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:23,127
So this is your proof?

698
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:27,499
Evidence you dare not reveal.

699
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,470
I don't have to.

700
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:35,469
The king's justice was with me
when I dug him up.

701
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:40,345
It's only a matter of time
before you're taken.

702
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,079
Why tell me this?

703
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,688
Because I'm giving you your life.

704
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,393
Your freedom.

705
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:05,063
But in return, I want hers.

706
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:09,136
A written confession,
to be found after you're gone.

707
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:19,451
I will not confess to a crime
I didn't commit.

708
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,423
Brother Paul is leaving.

709
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,680
Have they caught him yet?

710
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,219
Is it not enough that
an innocent woman should die?

711
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,655
Must I die too?

712
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,697
There is more at stake here
than you will ever know.

713
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,972
How do you sleep?

714
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,630
You!

715
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,245
Daniel! Leave him!
Leave him! Leave him!

716
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:32,280
The monk's dead,
found hanging in his chamber.

717
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,445
Dead by his own hand.

718
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,013
Out! Out!

719
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:03,242
I'll have no gropers here! Out!

720
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,986
Gentlemen excepted, of course.

721
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,218
You went to see him. Why?

722
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:11,416
To ask for his confession,
and if you'd just...

723
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,152
- In return for his freedom?
- He wouldn't have got far.

724
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,229
His confession, if there was one,
will never be found.

725
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,764
This is his confession.
Why else take his own life?

726
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,228
He didn't. When a man is hanged,

727
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:23,462
the rope rides up
behind the jaw, the ears.

728
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,231
The weight of the body drags it up.

729
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:28,001
He was throttled.

730
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,283
Because of you, all is lost.

731
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,449
It's over.

732
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:45,991
Leave.

733
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,758
Before they hang you too.

734
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,063
No, no, no, no, no.

735
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,037
No, no, no, no, no.

736
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,679
No, no, no. No.

737
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,209
No, no.

738
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:11,983
Our horses, fetch. Saddle them.

739
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,552
How long have you known?

740
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,225
How long?

741
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:32,430
There was talk of other boys
in France

742
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:36,168
while Lord de Guise was
on campaign with King Richard.

743
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,372
We needed him then.

744
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,073
At what price?

745
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:47,080
The greater good of the nation
is a strict mistress to serve.

746
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:49,280
Oh, I'm sure she is.

747
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,787
And does she now demand
that de Guise is brought down?

748
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:56,791
Yes, if many more are not to die.

749
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,963
He's planning a rebellion
against the king.

750
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,500
They're gathered in the castle
as we speak.

751
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:10,304
So, to you, the children
were just a detail?

752
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:13,310
They were a reason to arrest him.

753
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,414
Our only hope

754
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:22,114
was to get the monk to turn
king's evidence against de Guise.

755
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,534
You see now what
your interfering has done?

756
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,136
You should have told me.

757
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,279
A player?

758
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,749
Affairs of state?

759
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:55,583
You soothe your conscience
with grand phrases.

760
01:19:56,424 --> 01:20:01,555
But it's a weak, contemptible man
who trades in the lies of others.

761
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:08,492
De Guise is beyond my reach,
and certainly beyond yours.

762
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,728
Tell the people the truth.

763
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,067
They have a right to know the truth.

764
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,608
You think they don't know?

765
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,278
Thanks to him,
they have food enough and shelter.

766
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:24,012
In these times,
how many can say the same?

767
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:29,285
Theirs is the silence of consent.

768
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,783
I'm not sure I can do this.

769
01:22:47,662 --> 01:22:50,324
We are come here
to execute the sentence

770
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:53,831
passed down by our lord's court
upon this woman,

771
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:58,136
found guilty of the murder
of Thomas Wells.

772
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,036
She is to be raised from the ground
by her neck,

773
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:04,040
and her body drawn until she be dead.

774
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,714
Let her death be a lesson to all

775
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:10,643
who would stray from the paths
of righteousness.

776
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,085
She is so brave.

777
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,161
&

778
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:25,498
God bless you!

779
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,319
Stop this!

780
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:52,319
Stop!

781
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,258
Arrest them!

782
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:09,466
We came here
in ignorance and poverty!

783
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:14,604
Poverty drove us to claim
your story as our own!

784
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:17,144
And ignorance blinded us
to its truthful telling.

785
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:20,515
For both, we beg your forgiveness

786
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:23,282
and in return we offer you...

787
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,125
the true story of Thomas Wells.

788
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:29,354
- Yeah, tell us!
- Get word to the castle!

789
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:33,157
Let us begin.

790
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:44,436
It was dark, someone was watching.

791
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,100
But it wasn't this woman
stood here before you.

792
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:52,774
It was the monk,
Brother Simon Damian.

793
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,312
Think of it.

794
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,648
Imagine it!

795
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,346
Thomas...

796
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,717
Thomas would have gone willing,

797
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:06,049
trusting that a man of God
could not possibly

798
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:09,390
have designs upon the money
he was carrying.

799
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:15,358
But a night, a day,
and another night passed...

800
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:20,441
and Thomas was dead,
with his life wrung from him.

801
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,311
He had already been missing
for two days...

802
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:33,313
when he was found at daybreak
by Jack Flint.

803
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:40,154
Flint had difficulty,
and this is important.

804
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,558
He had difficulty loading the body
onto his horse

805
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:46,700
because it was stiff with rigor mortis.

806
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:53,439
Now, he took that poor dead boy
back here to the town.

807
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,403
And bad news travels quickly.

808
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:59,171
Thomas Wells is dead.

809
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:01,041
- Thomas Wells is dead.
- You people...

810
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,707
- Thomas Wells is dead.
- You became angry.

811
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:07,054
- Thomas Wells is dead.
- And the monk...

812
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:10,481
The monk was frightened.
So he lied.

813
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:15,493
He said that he had seen
this woman, Martha Lambert,

814
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:18,154
near the woods
the night Thomas disappeared.

815
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:21,233
And his word was enough...

816
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,638
because he was a man of God.

817
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:31,073
Now, he acted swiftly,
and he, the sheriff and his men

818
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:33,179
went to Martha's house to arrest her.

819
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:37,250
But Martha wasn't there, and she
hadn't been the previous day, either.

820
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,545
Where was she?

821
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,116
She was away.

822
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:46,651
She was away healing the poor.

823
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:50,293
Giving her time to people like you.

824
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:54,801
They broke down her door.

825
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:58,695
They searched
and they ransacked her house.

826
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,735
There, down!

827
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,645
And remember,
the monk still had the purse.

828
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:09,609
And when he was alone, in her room,

829
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,580
he hid it under her bed,
where it was then discovered.

830
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:16,583
Lies!

831
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:21,418
He took this evidence
that would hang a woman with him,

832
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,291
and he placed it there, a man of God!

833
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,126
Lies, I say!

834
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,734
She killed the boy!

835
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:30,330
- How?
- With her bare hands!

836
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:32,335
- She choked the life from him!
- Why?

837
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,099
- The money he was carrying.
- When?

838
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,469
The night he disappeared.

839
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:39,135
Then why was the body still stiff when
Jack Flint found him two days later?

840
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:43,608
The rigor mortis
would have gone by then.

841
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:45,753
Speak up, then!

842
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:51,418
You have an innocent woman
standing on your scaffold.

843
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:04,502
My Lord de Guise?

844
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:10,006
Now, you all know Martha!

845
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:12,270
You know her!

846
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:17,411
She doesn't have much,
but what she has, she gave freely!

847
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:20,577
Do not let her pay for it with her life!

848
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:23,350
You can stop this!

849
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:28,422
You can stop this
because you have the truth.

850
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:32,494
And the truth has power in it.

851
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:37,535
Thomas was not killed
that first night.

852
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,104
No, he was taken away

853
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:42,037
and he was held hostage
till the following day...

854
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:45,173
during which time he was subjected

855
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:50,613
to the most brutal, unspeakable acts.

856
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,454
Unspeakable acts.

857
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:12,195
But it was not the monk
that violated and killed Thomas.

858
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:15,407
Nor did he kill himself.

859
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:19,239
He was murdered by the very man
whose hunger he only served.

860
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:22,074
The man for whom
he procured the boys.

861
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:27,078
Lord Robert de Guise!

862
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:30,383
Lord de Guise!

863
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,617
De Guise!

864
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:40,597
He killed Thomas!
And he killed your other boys!

865
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,769
De Guise!

866
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,372
Stephen!

867
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:26,269
You dare to accuse Lord de Guise?

868
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:29,109
I dare to tell the truth!
Just the truth!

869
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:32,115
You ask yourself who had Thomas
buried so quickly

870
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:33,776
not even his mother
could see the body!

871
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:36,351
Get Nicholas! Out! Get out!

872
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,185
Go!

873
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,764
They're coming!

874
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,610
Martha, quickly!

875
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:58,475
Quickly!

876
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,246
- Point the way!
- Go, go!

877
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,245
Come on!

878
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:07,780
- Quickly!
- To the church!

879
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,020
Quickly!

880
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,988
Quick!

881
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:47,183
May I ask who you are?

882
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:54,833
May I see the face of the man
who wishes to know?

883
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:10,740
I'm Nicholas de Vilance.

884
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:20,583
Of Norman blood, like myself.

885
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,196
Well, houses become
somewhat diluted over the years.

886
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:31,599
And why have you come here,
Nicholas de Vilance?

887
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,106
No reason.

888
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,749
No, fate.

889
01:33:45,753 --> 01:33:48,244
Do you believe in fate?

890
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:52,353
I believe in a fallen bridge
that drove us westward.

891
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:59,156
But that's not fate,
but poor workmanship.

892
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:04,369
We create our destiny.

893
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:08,667
Fate is the religion of the weak.

894
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:11,534
And you don't strike me as weak.

895
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:14,543
Foolish, maybe...

896
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:18,176
and headstrong, yes...

897
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:21,113
but not weak.

898
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:39,700
So it seems I'm accused by you
of unnatural acts and murder.

899
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:43,070
- Do you deny it?
- Not only deny it,

900
01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:47,646
but defy you or any other man
to prove otherwise.

901
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:52,142
Well, you know I cannot.

902
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:58,592
And therein lies your foolishness
and your ruin.

903
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:00,283
No.

904
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:03,122
No, don't threaten me.

905
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:06,197
We're protected by
the holy sanctuary of God's house.

906
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,165
Your threats mean nothing here.

907
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:15,700
Do you really believe that your God
has the power to protect you?

908
01:35:24,318 --> 01:35:25,979
No, nor the inclination.

909
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:30,453
Well, what kind of God is that?

910
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:38,362
The kind who allows
his innocent children to be murdered.

911
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:46,072
&

912
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:49,335
Well, since the beginning of time,

913
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,512
your God has had us
killing each other

914
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:54,510
under his various banners.

915
01:35:56,484 --> 01:36:01,251
So I'll ask you again,
what kind of God is that?

916
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:09,394
I don't claim to understand.

917
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,360
But I do believe.

918
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:17,063
The triumph of blind faith
over reason, huh?

919
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:21,140
But what you fail to understand...

920
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:26,273
is that between faith and reason
lies the only true god:

921
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:30,314
Power.

922
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:38,448
You mean the power of evil?

923
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:41,294
To murder without conscience?

924
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:46,194
We are taught that God
bears no responsibility for evil.

925
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,195
That evil springs not from him,

926
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:55,000
but from the freedom of choice
he has granted to us.

927
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:57,576
Well, then, that freedom
is a thankless gift

928
01:36:57,778 --> 01:37:01,270
if all the suffering in the world
is the price we must pay for it.

929
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:05,043
Sacrilege to the ears of a priest.

930
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:08,016
Sacrilege from the mouth of a priest.

931
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:10,590
No.

932
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:20,127
And what crime drove you into
the arms of traveling actors, Father?

933
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:24,263
Adultery.

934
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,472
How disappointing.

935
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,128
And murder.

936
01:37:57,438 --> 01:38:00,566
And you dare lecture me?

937
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:14,010
You and your companions
are free to leave.

938
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:18,620
You have my word
you will not be harmed.

939
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:21,086
And if we refuse?

940
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:25,588
Are you prepared to die?

941
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:27,328
Are you?

942
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,534
Thomas Wells
was taken with the plague.

943
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:41,675
It is the one consolation in all this.

944
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:45,677
He was dead before
you so much as touched him.

945
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:53,259
What did Brother Damian tell you?

946
01:38:54,028 --> 01:38:56,019
Not the truth.

947
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:02,635
He dared not tell you the truth.

948
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:07,238
That he brought you a boy
touched with the plague.

949
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:23,454
You want to know why
I did what I did?

950
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:27,126
Well...

951
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:32,094
because I wanted to.

952
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,468
And...

953
01:39:38,005 --> 01:39:39,734
because I...

954
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:43,103
could.

955
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:45,104
&

956
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:52,512
Arrest them all.

957
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:57,214
Wait.

958
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:37,353
Hold me.

959
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:03,967
Godspeed, my friend.

960
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:15,114
His death was not in vain.

961
01:44:16,016 --> 01:44:19,577
King Richard shall know
of the great service he rendered.

962
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:27,125
He didn't do it for you... or your king.

963
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:34,328
Stephen? Straw?

964
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:36,594
Load up the cart.

965
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:41,739
We have to be off... to Durham.

966
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:45,567
To perform our new play.

967
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:01,745
Let's go!
