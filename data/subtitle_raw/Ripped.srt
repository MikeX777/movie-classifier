1
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,590
Mm.

2
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,392
Mm-mm-mm.

3
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,063
Dude, this is good chili.

4
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,631
What's in this?

5
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,266
Can't tell you.

6
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,700
Mom's secret recipe.

7
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,235
Oh yeah?

8
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,706
Yo man, how many of these
seeds you think we've

9
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,142
thrown over here over the
past couple of years?

10
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,110
Huh?

11
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,545
What, a quadrillion?

12
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,713
Is that a real number?

13
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,783
I don't know if it's a
real number and a fake

14
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:28,754
word, or a fake word
and a real number.

15
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,358
It's like, how come
the weed won't grow?

16
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,163
Man, we found the only
spot in the northwest

17
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,665
where weed won't grow.

18
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,633
It's not good.

19
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,402
Come on dude, let's go.

20
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,837
We're gonna be late
picking up Debbie.

21
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,475
-Let's do this.
-Let's do it!

22
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,876
Come on.

23
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,878
Come on man!

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:03:46,959
Hey!

25
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,849
Hold up! Wait up, wait up. I
forgot my bike, hold on.

26
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,792
Hi, Mr. Sanchez.

27
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,795
I'm Harris,
Debbie's boyfriend.

28
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,865
We're here to take Debbie to
the raising hell concert.

29
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,433
Is she ready?

30
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,767
What up dude?

31
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,372
I mean sir dude.

32
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,776
You've got to
be kidding me.

33
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,545
I know, women right?

34
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,746
Never ready on time.

35
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,914
No, we'll wait.

36
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,683
Hey, by any chance you
got any munchy snacks?

37
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,719
I know you got 'em.

38
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,188
Don't you hold out on me!

39
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,732
Mm!

40
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,736
Mmm!

41
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,938
So Debbie tells
me you're not planning on

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,206
going to college.

43
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,641
No sir.

44
00:02:55,643 --> 00:05:51,284
We don't need college.

45
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,577
Reeves and I are going to
start our own business and

46
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,179
live off the grid.

47
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:00,812
That's right.

48
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:01,680
Off the what?

49
00:03:01,682 --> 00:06:03,362
Oh, well, you know.

50
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:06,685
Not get caught up in the
whole corporate rat race.

51
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,955
Corporations kill
the working man.

52
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,224
- I got this.
- -Yeah, I.

53
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,292
It's a really cool idea.

54
00:03:13,294 --> 00:06:26,586
-Are you ready?
-Mhm.

55
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:17,362
Reeves and I drive around
the country selling coffee

56
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,264
on street corners.

57
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,633
Wow!

58
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,834
-Right?
-Right?

59
00:03:22,836 --> 00:06:45,670
Yo, dude, okay.

60
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:26,471
And then sometimes we'll
just set up right in the

61
00:03:26,473 --> 00:06:52,944
middle of the street if

62
00:03:26,473 --> 00:06:52,944
-there ain't no corners!
-Yeah!

63
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,441
-You know what I mean?
-Absolutely.

64
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,442
Where the corner at?

65
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,588
You want a whip it?

66
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,322
Mm.

67
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,323
Whip it?

68
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,393
I was wrong
about you boys.

69
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,695
I want to apologize.

70
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:50,929
Oh, no need.

71
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,565
And this idea of yours
is one surefire plan for

72
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,833
success.

73
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,469
-Yes, baby, yes!
-Mhmm!

74
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,608
This should be enough to
intoxicate my daughter,

75
00:04:02,610 --> 00:08:05,218
don't you think?

76
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,677
Sir, we're, we're not
going to need that.

77
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,679
Oh yeah, sir,
no, we're fine.

78
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,014
We already have
vodka in our Van.

79
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,916
Oh.

80
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,851
-So you have a Van.
-Yeah!

81
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,519
I assume you must have a
mattress in the back

82
00:04:14,521 --> 00:08:29,040
of the Van as well.

83
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,789
-No, no!
-Ha ha, not yet, not yet!

84
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,392
There's nothing like
fornicating in the back of

85
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,827
a Van, huh?

86
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,861
Am I right?

87
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,334
Well sir we're not into
the whole fucking animals

88
00:04:29,336 --> 00:08:58,670
thing.

89
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,471
Hey, how are you
guys on condoms?

90
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,741
You know, on second
thought, it'll probably be

91
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:39,011
a lot more fun
to violate my daughter

92
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,480
without protection.

93
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,016
And you can join
in too, gordito!

94
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,053
You're not going to
let her go, are you?

95
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,589
-Why not?
-Because I don't like you boys.

96
00:04:50,591 --> 00:09:41,180
Okay?

97
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,859
You're stoners, this
concert is way too far

98
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,296
away, and Debbie
is a minor.

99
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,764
Alright, so
that's one reason.

100
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,932
And let me add
something else, okay?

101
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,802
In all my years, I have
never heard of such a

102
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,305
stupid idea
for a business.

103
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,373
Selling cups of coffee?

104
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,377
That's as dumb as trying
to sell bottles of water!

105
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,513
Alright, alright.

106
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,580
Alright.

107
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,316
I see what's going on.

108
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,084
So, sir.

109
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:24,656
What if I promise
not to fuck her?

110
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,326
-Wh-relax! We're negotiating.
-Sir.

111
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,961
Shh!

112
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,564
Can I just talk
to Debbie, please?

113
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,532
No.

114
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,533
Okay.

115
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,639
So uh, can I go upstairs
and talk to Debbie?

116
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,342
What part of "no" is
confusing to you boys?

117
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,010
I don't know about him,
but to me, between the "k"

118
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,014
and the "w" being silent,
i-it's just never made any

119
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,749
sense to me.

120
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,918
You don't need this
because I'm sure you have

121
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,720
plenty of weed
in your Van.

122
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,620
Pssh, no!

123
00:05:55,622 --> 00:11:51,242
I wish we had...

124
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:59,458
Yo, first off, I wish we
had plenty of weed in the

125
00:05:59,460 --> 00:11:58,918
back of our Van, okay?

126
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,561
We're actually about to go
pick up some weed from one

127
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,563
of my homies that we know
on the way there because

128
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,399
we running a little low,
so you don't really know

129
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,569
everything silent-k
silent-w about everything

130
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,037
that me and him have going on.

131
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,739
So y-yeah.

132
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,474
I want you boys
out of my house.

133
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,008
Vamanos! Sal afuera!

134
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,577
Out!

135
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,883
Man, I think Debbie
ratted us out.

136
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,818
How did he know
we were stoners?

137
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,389
What the!

138
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,109
Debbie!

139
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,652
Oh.

140
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,456
I guess Tommy gave
us the wrong address.

141
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,590
Um...

142
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,559
Do you know
where Joe lives?

143
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,794
I'm Joe.

144
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,028
You're here for herb?

145
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,596
You're the dealer?

146
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,699
I mean, you look like you
could be selling avon.

147
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,067
I sell that too.

148
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,804
Lip gloss or weed?

149
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,706
Make up your mind.

150
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,808
Weed.

151
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,115
Wow, she really
does sell avon.

152
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,518
Northwest division
salesperson of the year.

153
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,086
What are the odds...

154
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,122
-Oh my god!
-Oh my, what the...

155
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,657
I think you guys are cops.

156
00:07:38,659 --> 00:15:17,316
What?

157
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,992
Yo, look w-we just
changed our minds, right?

158
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:41,993
Didn't we change our mind?

159
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,628
We came her for
some lip gloss.

160
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,596
Lip gloss. You got some...

161
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,630
What's Tommy's
middle name?

162
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,598
W-we don't know!

163
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,166
I swear, I swear!

164
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,135
Uh!

165
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:53,939
I don't either.

166
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,006
I'm just fucking with you.

167
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,575
-Ha ha...
-That's...

168
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,677
That's funny.

169
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,645
Take off your clothes.

170
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,546
--What?

171
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,781
Take off your clothes...

172
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,683
Take off your clothes.

173
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,551
Do you want the
weed or not?

174
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,854
Yeah, but why would we
need to take off our clothes?

175
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,755
Do I need to get my
strap-on so we can do a

176
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:11,990
few dance numbers first?

177
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,858
No, no!

178
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,860
No strap-on at all.

179
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,261
But, this, but
you're funny though.

180
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,497
Strip, ladies.

181
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,202
Strip, bitches.

182
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,077
Um, well, you know,
probably just to like make sure

183
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,044
we're not wired
or something?

184
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,647
No, man! No! No! No!

185
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,648
I saw this!

186
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,782
I saw this in my mind!

187
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,984
I saw this happening!

188
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,852
Really? You saw this coming?

189
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,687
The dealer was going to
turn out to be an avon

190
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,724
lady who would put a gun
to our head and threaten

191
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,193
to fuck us with a
strap-on phallus.

192
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,861
Yeah? Yeah?
That was your vision?

193
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,629
Yes!

194
00:08:50,631 --> 00:17:41,260
I saw that, alright!

195
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,865
I knew that was going to
happen, but I didn't know

196
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,834
what the word "phallus"
meant until like...

197
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:56,868
Right now.

198
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,104
See?

199
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,739
We're not wired.

200
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,113
I wasn't worried
about that.

201
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,315
I just wanted to
see you naked.

202
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,252
That reminds me, i
need to buy cashews.

203
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,554
Hey...

204
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,124
Price is 200.

205
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,091
Dollars?

206
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,693
No, pesos.

207
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,864
This shit was grown in
area 51 where they keep

208
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,966
the aliens.

209
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,634
You ever heard of g-13?

210
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,602
No way.

211
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,671
No way!

212
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,306
Are you telling me
that's that, that's that

213
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,575
super-secret CIA weed?

214
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,177
This is g-14.

215
00:09:39,179 --> 00:19:18,356
Oh, what?

216
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,048
Most of the CIA can't even
get their hands on this

217
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,015
shit yet.

218
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,150
Well how'd you get it?

219
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,753
Fucked a guy
who knows a guy.

220
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,021
That's all I'm gonna say.

221
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,791
Yo, those are the kind of
stories you can't make up

222
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,092
even if you try.

223
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,027
I really think she fucked
a guy who knows a guy.

224
00:09:56,029 --> 00:19:52,560
Yeah, I know.

225
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,996
When people
say shit like that,

226
00:09:57,998 --> 00:19:55,994
they're telling the truth.

227
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,733
I think she fucked a dude
that maybe just know a dude.

228
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,335
You don't have $200!

229
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,003
Um...

230
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,172
But.. $200.

231
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,841
T-that's a lot.

232
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,147
Tell you what.

233
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,822
You go down on me, I'll
take off 10 percent.

234
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,925
Ha!

235
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,127
That's, uh, that's funny.

236
00:10:29,129 --> 00:20:58,256
That's really good.

237
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:34,299
You make me squirt,
I'll take off 20.

238
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,235
Squirt what?

239
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,146
Dude, I can't
believe we actually.

240
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,781
Mm. Mm.

241
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,750
I thought we agreed we
weren't even going to talk

242
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,786
about it.

243
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,838
Dude, are you sure
this is a shortcut?

244
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,109
I mean, I have not seen
any lights for a while now.

245
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,844
I think we should
turn around.

246
00:11:21,847 --> 00:22:43,693
Here?

247
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:26,017
No, after another 30
minutes of darkness.

248
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,996
You said here!

249
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,342
-Fuck!
-Agh!

250
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,245
-This is shit!
-Aw, dude...

251
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,481
We're stuck in a hole, man.

252
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,284
Well I'm not
licking this one.

253
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,852
Twice in one day?

254
00:12:00,854 --> 00:24:01,706
Euh.

255
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,722
Yeah, looks like we might
have to spend the night

256
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,190
here tonight.

257
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,958
Fuck!

258
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,860
We're gonna miss
the concert!

259
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,968
Oh my goodness!

260
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,904
Pledge.

261
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,909
Dude, do you, do you,
like, hear that?

262
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,349
What?

263
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:36,187
Dude, I could,
like, hear my ears

264
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,490
listening to things.

265
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,926
What?

266
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,361
Huh.

267
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,866
You mean to tell me that
you can hear your

268
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,968
your ears operating?

269
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,436
Yeah bro.

270
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,541
Yo, this CIA shit
is crazy strong, man, yo!

271
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,177
Like, I feel
like I gotta piss but

272
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,812
I don't even know.

273
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,916
Yo, fuck, I'm high.

274
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,086
Dude.

275
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,559
Dude, my hand...

276
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,096
My hand looks
like a tarantula.

277
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,267
I don't even feel
my hands anymore.

278
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,874
I'm hungry, bro.

279
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,444
I wish I had some of your
chili right now with a, a

280
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:37,849
bowl of cheese a-and
a slice of ice cream.

281
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,251
-Mm.
-Switch

282
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,859
you know what i
wish right now?

283
00:13:47,861 --> 00:27:35,720
Hm?

284
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:53,998
I wish these fingers were
just little kit-Kat bars.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,899
Then...

286
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,835
I could just...

287
00:13:56,837 --> 00:27:53,672
Break one off.

288
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:01,139
Break you off a piece,
and

289
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,073
mm!

290
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,608
They're so good!

291
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,511
You alright bro?

292
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,982
Oh my god!

293
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,985
Feels like my whole
face is in my mouth!

294
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,320
Oh!

295
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,155
Why are my balls
vibrating?

296
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,192
I can't feel my cock.

297
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,396
Oh my god.

298
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,464
What?

299
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,967
My cock is gone!

300
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,402
Fuck!

301
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,277
She stole your cock.

302
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,546
-Someone stole your cock!
-Someone stole my cock!

303
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,082
Cock thief! Cock thief!

304
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,049
Stole it right
underneath me!

305
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,584
Gimme your cock!

306
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,968
Yo, I slept like a baby.

307
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,403
Ugh, me too.

308
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,039
That weed knocked
me the fuck out.

309
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,642
Mm.

310
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,550
You look older than
a motherfucker.

311
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,456
Holy shit, you
look old as fuck!

312
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,427
Hee!

313
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,163
This must have some
hallucinogenic shit in it.

314
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,398
That's fuckin' cool.

315
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,366
We must be
halla-ducinatin' now.

316
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,634
Oh yeah.

317
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,472
Man, I feel like we've
been walking for days.

318
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,609
Ahh, I'm fuckin' hot.

319
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,978
This is the worst
hallucination ever.

320
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,495
The fuck...

321
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,598
A fuckin' space ship.

322
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,000
We're not hallucinating.

323
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,668
We're still dreaming.

324
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,637
How do you know this is
your dream and not mine?

325
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
Because I always
dream of spaceships.

326
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,009
Let's keep walking.

327
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,715
Welcome.

328
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,051
What the fuck was that?

329
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,987
It's a talking door?

330
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,589
What's happening?

331
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,158
Hello, door.

332
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,127
How are you?

333
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,595
Nice to meet you.

334
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,202
Why's everybody on
their calculator?

335
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,474
We walked all this way for
a fuckin' math convention!

336
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,276
I hate math.

337
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,379
And I gotta take a shit.

338
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,443
2016?

339
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,079
What the fuck?

340
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,615
Thank you.

341
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,783
Have a nice day.

342
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,755
What the fuck?

343
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,695
What the fuck is that?

344
00:17:45,831 --> 00:35:31,661
I'm at the gas station.

345
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,533
Oh
sweetheart, I miss you so

346
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,735
much, I can't wait to
see you my little boo.

347
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,503
I'll be here for
a couple hours.

348
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,807
Who the fuck is that?

349
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,142
The fuck?

350
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,310
Welcome.

351
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,596
Yo!

352
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,665
Check this out.

353
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,500
Government approves...

354
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,368
No, not that. Look at the date.

355
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,204
June 12, 2016.

356
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,772
It's one of those
fake news papers.

357
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,507
Uh-uh. This shit is real.

358
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,876
I went outside and saw a
dude with his car plugged in.

359
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,612
The price of gas is $5 a
gallon, and I seen a girl

360
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,848
with a thing in her hand
that she was talking to a

361
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,283
dude, and he was there,
like a video call.

362
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,419
But did you see this?

363
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,354
That's fucked up.

364
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,889
Check this out though.

365
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,390
That's proof that
this is a fake.

366
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,327
If you go by this
newspaper here, this guy

367
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,461
is black, right?

368
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,530
And his name is o-bam-a?

369
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,466
Barack Obama, and
he's the President of the

370
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,734
United States.

371
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,202
Exactly.

372
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,872
Excuse me sir.

373
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:01,839
What's the date?

374
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,441
June the 12th, man.

375
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,243
What year?

376
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,245
2016!

377
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,220
Hey, get off me
man, get off me!

378
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,756
Right, right, right right,
I'm gonna let, yeah right.

379
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,393
Who's the president?

380
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,395
Barack Obama.

381
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,796
What he look like?

382
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,665
He's black!

383
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,368
That weed we smoked
knocked us out for

384
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,702
30 years!

385
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,437
We need to get a tow
truck, get your Van out

386
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,939
the ditch, and get
the fuck on home.

387
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,174
Let's go.

388
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,408
This damn CIA.

389
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,677
First Vietnam, then
Reagan gets shot.

390
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,852
Ever heard of
a turn signal?

391
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,921
It's nobody's fuckin'
business where we're going.

392
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,466
Well, your parents definitely
don't live here anymore.

393
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,304
They really mean it when they
say you can't go home again.

394
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,874
So...

395
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,743
Our old school is
a home depot now.

396
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,247
-Mm.
-Your old house is a vacant lot.

397
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,849
And mine's a
fucking soul mart?

398
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,752
There's nothing left
from our fucking life!

399
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,889
And what the fuck
is "glutton free?"

400
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,291
I dunno but the
gluttons eat free.

401
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,960
We should act like some
gluttons and go eat.

402
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,695
I'm starving, man.

403
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,930
Nah, let's go by
Debbie's parents' house.

404
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,799
Maybe they still
live there.

405
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,667
And they'll feed us.

406
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,273
<i> Hello?</i>

407
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,574
Uh, hi Mrs. Sanchez?

408
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,775
<i> Yes?</i>

409
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,344
This is Harris.

410
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,812
Harris weber.

411
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,947
<i> Who?</i>

412
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,749
Uh, Debbie's boyfriend?

413
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,984
Her...

414
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,952
Old boyfriend, I guess?

415
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,656
Harris has been
dead for 30 years.

416
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,558
<i> This isn't funny.</i>

417
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,960
They really gonna
think this is funny.

418
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,733
<i> Go away!</i>

419
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,800
<i> Leave!</i>

420
00:21:11,637 --> 00:42:23,273
I...

421
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:15,906
I know this probably
sounds crazy but...

422
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,051
Hi, Mrs. Sanchez.

423
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,420
It's uh...

424
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,389
I know this is probably
really weird for you right

425
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,923
now but...

426
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,459
Probably didn't
expect to see us after all

427
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,560
these years.

428
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,964
Yeah.

429
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,432
This can't be...

430
00:21:43,702 --> 00:43:27,403
Debbie?

431
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,003
Where the hell
have you been!

432
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,376
Ow.

433
00:21:52,378 --> 00:43:44,754
Agh...

434
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:57,048
You guys want me to
believe that you bought

435
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,985
some super pot from a
woman named Joe who was

436
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:05,723
screwing a CIA guy who was
growing pot in area 51

437
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,658
"where they keep the
aliens," on your way to a

438
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,061
concert that you never got
to because your Van fell

439
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:12,630
into a ditch where you
slept for 30 years, and

440
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,333
all of the sudden you woke
up one day and here you are.

441
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,034
Crazy shit, right?

442
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,737
Were you in prison?

443
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,105
You were in prison,
weren't you.

444
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,474
-Like in Bolivia or something.
-If only.

445
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,509
Hey, up here.

446
00:22:25,511 --> 00:44:51,020
What happened to you guys?

447
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,412
What really happened
to you guys?

448
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,348
That is what
really happened.

449
00:22:30,350 --> 00:45:00,698
Mhmm.

450
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,853
Do you have any idea how
serious your disappearance was?

451
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,023
There were news reports, there
were missing persons reports.

452
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,392
Your parents hired
private detectives.

453
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,728
We had no idea where
you disappeared to.

454
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,965
Eventually, we just
thought you were dead.

455
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,867
Your parents held
funerals for you.

456
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,968
For closure.

457
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,903
-We had funerals?
-Yeah.

458
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,406
You're buried at the
cemetery on Madison street.

459
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,841
Was it a nice service?

460
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,042
Nice funeral.

461
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,143
Did people show up?

462
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,478
A few.

463
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,579
Was it sad?

464
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,147
Guys, is this
supposed to be funny?

465
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,882
Because it's not.

466
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,852
Look, we don't understand what
happened either, but we're

467
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:08,986
telling you what happened.

468
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,821
That doesn't mean
it's believable.

469
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,923
It just means that's
what the fuck happened.

470
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,626
I can't believe you
still live with your parents.

471
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,628
-It's my house now.
-No shit?

472
00:23:17,630 --> 00:46:35,258
-That's right.
-Wow.

473
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,065
Hey, do you know where
my parents moved to?

474
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,633
Because I can't find them.

475
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,569
Wow.

476
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,004
You don't know, do you?

477
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,841
Your parents died
like ten years ago.

478
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,744
What the fuck?

479
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,582
That's a bummer bro.

480
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,885
What about my parents?

481
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,186
Yours moved away.

482
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:45,656
Um, we have no idea
where they moved.

483
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,724
We never saw them again.

484
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:49,093
They, they moved to
the mountains.

485
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,128
My eyes are here, Reeves.

486
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,631
My father loved mountains.

487
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,799
I see what you're saying.

488
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,600
There's some good
peaks out there.

489
00:23:56,602 --> 00:47:53,202
This is crazy.

490
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,737
I don't know what
to say, I'm...

491
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:00,905
I'm a little freaked out.

492
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,473
I'm just...

493
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,775
Look, I know this is a
little crazy, us just

494
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,944
showing up after
all these years.

495
00:24:06,946 --> 00:48:13,890
Yeah.

496
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,582
Why don't we meet up again
tomorrow, to the mall or

497
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,083
something, maybe
go to the arcade.

498
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,552
Yeah, the arcade!

499
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,686
Okay.

500
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,721
So, what time you
want to hang out?

501
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,890
Oh, I don't hang
out. I go to work.

502
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,492
-So after work?
-Ditch!

503
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,860
Ditch!

504
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:23,727
After work?

505
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:24,562
Uh, sure.

506
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,030
Okay, so like two?

507
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,765
No, hon. This
is not school, it's work.

508
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,600
I'm like, seven, eight.

509
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,535
Okay, well we've got to,
at least, eight at the

510
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:34,038
latest, 'cause the food
court will close at nine.

511
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,648
Oh, Deb.

512
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,653
Hey wooly!

513
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,836
Oh my...

514
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,238
You guys slept in here?

515
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,639
Good morning.

516
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,976
Wow.

517
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,878
I can't believe you
still have this thing.

518
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,148
Look at you, all
businesswoman-like.

519
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,017
Like a professional.

520
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,185
You look great.

521
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,786
Thanks.

522
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:27,658
Um, the house is locked,
but if you want to clean

523
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,028
up, you can use the
rinse-off shower on the side.

524
00:25:31,030 --> 00:51:02,580
Good, thank you. We need that.

525
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,665
Debbie, I was in your back
yard last night, and I was

526
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,735
wondering, where'd you get this
really cool stormtrooper boot?

527
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:38,869
Man what the hell is that?

528
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,037
It's a stormtrooper boot.

529
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,639
Who stuck wheels
in an ice skate?

530
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:42,940
W-when were you
in my back yard?

531
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,808
I had to take a shit last
night and I didn't want

532
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,844
your neighbors all
in my business.

533
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,913
That's very
considerate of you.

534
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:52,049
That is a Rollerblade and
it belongs to my son.

535
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,617
We have a son?

536
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,587
No, no we, you, we don't
have a son.

537
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:57,154
No.

538
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,723
Wait...

539
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,724
How old is he?

540
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,825
He's fifteen.

541
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,561
He was at his
dad's last night.

542
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,231
Wait, you fucked
somebody else?

543
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,700
Yeah, I did.

544
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,636
Debbie's fuckin'!

545
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,172
I-i did.

546
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,807
And when am i
gonna meet him?

547
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,777
Uh, let's hold off
on that for now.

548
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,612
Why, is he ugly?
We're not going to laugh.

549
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,080
Oh my god, is he a retard?

550
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,152
Okay, it's because of
comments like that that we

551
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,153
are gonna hold off.

552
00:26:29,155 --> 00:52:58,308
And it's because
of all of this!

553
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:32,189
I mean, you know, I don't
want people in his life

554
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,291
that are not going to
be a good role model.

555
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,226
Good role model?

556
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,062
We're not good
role models?

557
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,264
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it like that.

558
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,865
-Hmm.
-Oh, hmm.

559
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,667
-Hmm!
-Well, maybe I did.

560
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,636
It's just...

561
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,372
You show up after
all these years.

562
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,609
Y-you're looking homeless,
you smell like I can't

563
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,877
even describe, and you're
sleeping in a Van.

564
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,347
Oh, but we got our
phat gold chains.

565
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,247
Shell toes.

566
00:26:57,249 --> 00:53:54,496
We good.

567
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:01,352
Brad's at a very
impressionable age right now.

568
00:27:01,354 --> 00:54:02,706
You named him Brad?

569
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:06,323
Anything that I'm saying
is just sounding terrible

570
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,758
and rude and I'm sorry.

571
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,126
I'm going to go
to work right now.

572
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,996
I'm going to go, okay?

573
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,297
I'm going to go.

574
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,069
Might be time for you guys
to start seeing other people.

575
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:22,072
Apparently she's been
seeing other people.

576
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,974
Guess what I'm seeing.

577
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,909
I thought you
finished all the weed.

578
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,144
I did.

579
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,713
But I found this on
Debbie's back porch.

580
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,856
Okay, now that we look
less homeless, what do we do?

581
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,427
Well, we're gonna stop telling
people what really happened.

582
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,130
Truck stop guy, tow
truck dude, Debbie...

583
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,331
They all said we
sounded crazy.

584
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,233
Shit, I was there and
i don't believe it.

585
00:27:49,235 --> 00:55:38,468
Here's what we do.

586
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:54,138
We drop the story, we
accept our situation, and

587
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,040
we go back to what
we were going to do.

588
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,108
You mean start
our business?

589
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,710
Sell coffee out of my Van?

590
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,045
Yeah.

591
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,946
Think about it, with
inflation, we could be

592
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,982
like making two
bucks a cup.

593
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,784
For coffee?

594
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,852
You sound crazy
as shit right now.

595
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,855
We'll call it two
buck a cuppa coffee.

596
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,757
You guys here
to fix the satellite?

597
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,159
The fuck's a satellite?

598
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,727
What are we,
fuckin' astronauts?

599
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,262
What do you mean
"satellite?"

600
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,963
Who the fuck are you?

601
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:20,998
My name's Brad.

602
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,366
I fuckin' live here.

603
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,435
We're friends of Debbie's.

604
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,403
Uh, Debbie? You mean my mother?

605
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,438
Oh shit!

606
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,073
That's Debbie's kid.

607
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,942
Debbie's been fuckin'!

608
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,378
That's her receipt!

609
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,116
Uh, yeah, listen, my mom's
friends don't smoke, so...

610
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,318
You don't know
your mom's friends.

611
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,787
That's my fuckin'
bag of joints, man!

612
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,189
What the fuck?

613
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,392
Fuck man you
smoking my weed man?

614
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,394
Jesus, guys you
smoked half my stash.

615
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,431
Oh relax, we'll
buy you more.

616
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,866
Call your dealer.

617
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,302
My dealer?

618
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,370
When's the last time
you bought weed?

619
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,372
Where do you get it from?

620
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,841
You just buy it.

621
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,043
You just walk into
7-11 and go buy weed?

622
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,078
Yeah, can me get some
chips, some soda, oh, and

623
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,246
some weed please?

624
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,318
Wait, you guys know
weed's legal now, right?

625
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,488
Wait, what?

626
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,527
I don't know why we need
this doctor to get pot

627
00:29:23,529 --> 00:58:47,056
from a store.

628
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,196
Well, if you have a
prescription, they give

629
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,397
a discount, so...

630
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,333
Ahh.

631
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,334
That's a good deal.

632
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:31,435
Part of the discount.

633
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,369
It is my birthday.

634
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,504
Happy birthday.

635
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:36,073
See, yeah. I
told you I'd hook you up.

636
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,176
Hello nurse!

637
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,978
I am not the nurse.

638
00:29:40,980 --> 00:59:21,958
I am Dr. gales.

639
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,216
Well with a body like
that, you ought to be a nurse.

640
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,185
Um, you don't have to
take your shirt off...

641
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:51,388
Well, I've taken my shirt
off for uglier girls,

642
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,323
so it's not a problem.

643
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,928
Um, I assume that you're having
trouble sleeping at night?

644
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,097
No, I sleep all
through the night.

645
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,501
You look like you're in
a lot of chronic pain.

646
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:08,105
No, but I do have an itch

647
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:12,242
you can scr-

648
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,911
-atch.

649
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,112
Mr. Cornell.

650
00:30:15,114 --> 01:00:30,226
Reeves.

651
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:18,048
I can't write you a
prescription for medical

652
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,284
marijuana unless there's
an actual need, do you

653
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,218
understand?

654
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,186
Right.

655
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,086
Mm.

656
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,924
Do you like Italian?

657
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,960
You're under a lot of
pressure aren't you?

658
00:30:29,962 --> 01:00:59,922
Right.

659
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,563
And you need something
to help calm you down.

660
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:34,298
Right!

661
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,200
Back hurts?

662
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:37,935
-Right!
-Can't sleep at night?

663
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,303
-Yeah!
-Constant migraines?

664
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,938
Yes, listen.

665
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,840
You take your shirt off,
I'm going to take my shirt

666
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,843
off, and we gonna
start fuckin'.

667
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,080
I am not a prostitute.

668
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,115
I didn't call
you a prostitute.

669
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,219
Okay.

670
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:59,122
Let's just say you gave
me a little medical

671
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,591
rubba-dub-dub.

672
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,594
You know like a medical
rub in a medical way?

673
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:08,332
Non-prostitute, but just
medically induced rub.

674
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,934
-Just a, you know...
-In a non-prostitute way?

675
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,604
In a non-prostitute
way. Just a...

676
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:17,507
-Oh? Oh?
-Yes.

677
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,575
Okay.

678
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,648
-Why didn't you say so?
-I was trying to...

679
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,316
Stand up.

680
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:30,354
Ooh.

681
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,456
Somebody's gonna be...

682
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,494
-Alright...
-Turn around.

683
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,963
Turn around!

684
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,332
Oh, no, and then stop.

685
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,334
-Oh.
-Like right there.

686
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,402
Right there.

687
00:31:45,404 --> 01:03:30,806
-And uh...
-Like this?

688
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,439
Why don't you, uh,
drop your pants, huh?

689
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,675
Oh, the old reach around.

690
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,079
-Dropping the...
-Pants...

691
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,314
Can you back that up?

692
00:31:57,316 --> 00:32:00,384
Mhmm, just gotta
help you out there.

693
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,685
Bend over.

694
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,287
Kind of rough
there, aren't you?

695
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,632
Welcome to home de-pot.

696
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,935
How can I help
medicate you.

697
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,569
We'll take it all.

698
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,538
You can't have it all.

699
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,274
What type of cannabis
are you looking for?

700
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,208
Cannabis?

701
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,478
Fuck that, we want weed!

702
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,614
At a discount...

703
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,216
Oh baby.

704
00:32:33,218 --> 01:05:06,434
Roll-a-bowls.

705
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:36,553
They are indestructible,
they are foldable, they

706
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,155
are portable.

707
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,190
Dishwasher safe.

708
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,391
Yeah?

709
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,360
-Just, we'll put that in there.
-Mhmm.

710
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:45,295
Got dick's elixirs
over there.

711
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,297
All different flavors.

712
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,100
Do these all have
weed in them?

713
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,435
Duh.

714
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:54,271
I think we're gonna
need a bigger basket.

715
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,026
It's about time
you guys showed up.

716
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,561
What are you drinking?

717
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,997
Oh, it's a mocha
vanilla latte.

718
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,032
-What?
-What's that?

719
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,700
It's coffee.

720
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,435
That's a coffee?

721
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,770
Where'd you get it?

722
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,172
From Starbucks. Hello?

723
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,044
Those Starbuck places
i see on every corner?

724
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,513
They just sell coffee?

725
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,115
Yeah.

726
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:42,085
Debbie's
dad stole our idea!

727
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,620
What the fuck are you
guys talking about?

728
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,690
God damn coffee thief!

729
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,258
I never trusted
her father.

730
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,727
I mean, I only known him
for two minutes, but them

731
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,196
two minutes, i
never trusted him.

732
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:58,535
I can't believe he stole
our business plan!

733
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,538
Took us fucking years to
come up with that shit!

734
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,708
"Like a son?"

735
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,076
What the fuck you
mean "like a son?"

736
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,711
I was your son!

737
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,451
This is so strange.

738
00:34:16,287 --> 01:08:32,573
I know.

739
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,056
I never thought I'd
live to see the day!

740
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,193
Hey!

741
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,628
It's bad to smoke
cigarettes.

742
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,097
You scared the
shit out of us.

743
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,298
It's not a cigarette.

744
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,633
It's a joint.

745
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,301
Marijuana.

746
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,237
Ganja, you know mon.

747
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,507
It's still smoking!

748
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,676
Well, it's our business,
and those are our

749
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:40,777
tombstones.

750
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,345
What are you, the
cemetery police?

751
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,847
Okay, get the fuck out of here.

752
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,715
We're grown.

753
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,517
And we're grieving.

754
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,688
What are you guys, ghosts?

755
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,861
Look here, I don't know if
you're some kind of

756
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,229
ghost whisperer.

757
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:02,766
I don't know why
you here, but...

758
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:07,337
We're here smoking weed,
minding our business.

759
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,707
If you're ghosts, how
'come I can't see through you?

760
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,743
Well, there's a simple
explanation for that.

761
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:17,781
Um, basically it's
because I'm black!

762
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,150
Now bounce, bitch!

763
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,193
Yo, I could really go for
a bowl of your chili right now.

764
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,696
Oh, yeah that
would be nice.

765
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,900
Yo, I got an idea!

766
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,437
What?

767
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,773
What's the one thing
people want when we're high.

768
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:46,276
I dunno, but I'm hungry
as a motherfucker.

769
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:48,278
Exactly!

770
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,448
We'll open up a restaurant
that sells your chili with

771
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,450
weed in it!

772
00:35:53,452 --> 01:11:46,902
That's actually brilliant!

773
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:57,521
Then when they get the
munchies, they're already there.

774
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,523
And then they eat more, and
then they have more

775
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,225
munchies, and
they keep eating.

776
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,660
They don't have
to go nowhere.

777
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,762
And even if they don't eat
that much, what do people

778
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,763
do when they're high?

779
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,198
They're messy,
they spill shit.

780
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,799
They'll spill the chili
and they'll have to buy

781
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:10,767
some more.

782
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,202
We'll be millionaires.

783
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,236
You just came
up with that?

784
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,337
Yeah.

785
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,839
No shit?

786
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,609
I mean you're some kind
of idea entrepreneur if

787
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,344
there's a word.

788
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,313
I'm an idealist.

789
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,881
Where are we gonna get
the money to open up a

790
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,184
restaurant, man?

791
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,652
The bank!

792
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,954
We'll go get a
loan from the bank!

793
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,190
No.

794
00:36:33,192 --> 01:13:06,382
Why not?

795
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:36,526
There are no other chili
restaurants in town.

796
00:36:36,528 --> 01:13:13,054
Are there?

797
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,665
It's the marijuana aspect.

798
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,367
Sir, weed is legal.

799
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,538
Yes, marijuana is
legal mister...

800
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,342
Weber, but that doesn't
mean a bank endorses it.

801
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:54,678
This bank is a
conservative organization.

802
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,615
Well I'm pretty sure there
are plenty of banks that will.

803
00:36:58,617 --> 00:36:59,349
Nope.

804
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:01,284
-Weed?
-No.

805
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,922
Leave.

806
00:37:07,758 --> 01:14:15,515
-I got an idea.
-Mhmm?

807
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,860
Let's leave out
the weed this time.

808
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:11,828
That's lying.

809
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,763
That's business.

810
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,765
I don't know.

811
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,267
You know they're
eventually going to find out.

812
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,735
Yeah, by the time they
find out we'll be paying

813
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,837
back the loan, and that's
all they really want.

814
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,272
I guess.

815
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,574
Look, you know those
restaurants that sell

816
00:37:24,576 --> 01:14:49,150
paintings?

817
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,744
You think they got a loan
for an art gallery and a

818
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,312
restaurant?

819
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,414
No, they added that later.

820
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,483
That's true.

821
00:37:33,485 --> 01:15:06,968
-But still...
-Yeah, that is true!

822
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,919
But still nothing!
This is the last bank.

823
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:39,389
Do you want this
loan or not?

824
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,991
Alright.

825
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,392
Let me fix you up.

826
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,696
Ba-bip-bam.

827
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,531
Passed you a wave, fool.

828
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,835
-Badow!
-Oh shit, let's go.

829
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,505
The restaurant
will serve chili?

830
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:56,840
That's it?

831
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:57,774
That's it.

832
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,442
Just chili.

833
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,044
Such a simple idea.

834
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:03,380
It could actually work.

835
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,949
Uh, looks like you guys
have really good credit, too.

836
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,718
Not one negative
thing pops up.

837
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,321
Why do you seem
annoyed by this?

838
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:14,357
Approving a loan means i
have a lot of paperwork in

839
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,026
front of me.

840
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,628
So, we got the loan?

841
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,630
Well, it's not
a slam dunk yet.

842
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,565
The application process
takes a few days and

843
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,067
you'll have to give a
short presentation to the

844
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,502
loan board.

845
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,003
But it looks good?

846
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,839
Unfortunately.

847
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,008
Guess I'll have to start
looking for my pen.

848
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,945
I gotcha!

849
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,451
Badass, right?

850
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,453
What the fuck is that?

851
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,954
Edm, man!

852
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,692
Electronic dance music!

853
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,660
Like skrillex, d-
are you kidding me?

854
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,495
Steve aoki? David guetta?

855
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,064
Dude, get up, get
up, get up, here.

856
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:56,533
I'll pull some of
this up on YouTube, c'mon.

857
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,503
Watch that.

858
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,740
-Yeah, what is he doing?
-He's killing it!

859
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:04,541
Doing what?

860
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:05,675
Slaying it!

861
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,043
Is he leading an
aerobics class?

862
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,446
Yeah, he's loving it up
there, he's like, woo!

863
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,815
But who's
playing the music?

864
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:12,782
What do you mean? He's djing.

865
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,718
He's uh, playing
the records.

866
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,618
The song just changed.

867
00:39:15,620 --> 01:18:31,238
Uh huh.

868
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,121
And his arms are in the
air. Is he djing with his dick?

869
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,723
Because that, to me,
would be impressive.

870
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:21,825
Yeah, that would be impressive.

871
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,593
He's a dick jockey.

872
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,064
Can I show you
how to dj please?

873
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,699
Yeah, show him
how to do it.

874
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,101
You keeping it
in your pants?

875
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,802
Yeah, I'm definitely
keeping it in my pants.

876
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,070
What am I, a priest?

877
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,672
Okay.

878
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,507
Uh, where's your turntables?

879
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,641
Go for it.

880
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,543
What the fuck is that?

881
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,045
The, yeah, like
turntables.

882
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,480
Like you scratch
them and shit.

883
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,448
No, where do you
put your records?

884
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,817
You, they're in
the computer.

885
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,119
You put all your records
in the computer?

886
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,554
No, well, I mean
the music is, yeah.

887
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,056
And then, I'm confused.

888
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,691
You just, yeah.

889
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,092
There, like,
that's the music.

890
00:39:56,094 --> 01:19:53,860
It's all there. It's...

891
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:59,429
-And then, this..
-Yeah, you search it, you find

892
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:00,130
-whatever you want.
-Mhmm.

893
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:01,865
There it is, and play.

894
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,600
-Play it here.
-Yeah.

895
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:04,667
And then...

896
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:09,873
Oop!

897
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,674
Alright, alright!

898
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,818
Here, put this shit on.

899
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,565
This is awesome!

900
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,500
This is djing!

901
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,203
Hey!

902
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,773
-H-hey!
-Hey, what's going on here?

903
00:40:43,775 --> 01:21:27,548
Hi.

904
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,910
I see you guys, uh, you
guys met each other.

905
00:40:46,912 --> 01:21:33,822
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,846
You never told me you had
such cool friends, mom.

907
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,047
Yeah. They're cool.

908
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,782
They're really cool.

909
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,851
Just teaching
him how to dj.

910
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:55,885
Uh huh, yeah.

911
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,120
He's good, he's
really good.

912
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,689
That's great,
that's... that's great.

913
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,524
I didn't think that
you'd meet them so soon.

914
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,193
I thought they'd
be gone by now.

915
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,728
Are you taking off?

916
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,763
Uh, yeah.

917
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:08,064
Uh, I don't know.

918
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,802
Hey honey, I want to talk
to them real quick, okay?

919
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,903
Can you go to your room?

920
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,038
It's old people talk.

921
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,206
It's, it's really boring.

922
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,041
Yeah, yeah! Of course.

923
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:19,809
Nice kid.

924
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,678
These guys are
really cool, mom.

925
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,613
They're super cool, yeah. Yeah.

926
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,216
Hi!

927
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,117
Ta-daa!

928
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,552
Hey!

929
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,822
What was the one
thing I told you guys?

930
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,691
You said a lot
of fucking shit. I mean...

931
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,060
I said I didn't want
you to meet my son.

932
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,628
Get it? Remember that?

933
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,597
You guys are
pissing me off here.

934
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,632
It's better to be pissed
off than pissed on.

935
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,600
You're pissed?

936
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,935
Your dad stole our idea!

937
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:46,769
What?

938
00:41:46,771 --> 01:23:33,540
Starbucks!

939
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,938
That's his
company, isn't it?

940
00:41:48,940 --> 01:23:37,878
What?

941
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:53,710
My dad has nothing
to do with Starbucks.

942
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:56,045
Listen, you're not the
guilty party in this.

943
00:41:56,047 --> 01:23:52,920
You don't have
to protect him.

944
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:58,748
Yeah, he has
nothing to do with s...

945
00:41:58,750 --> 01:23:57,498
I beg to differ.

946
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,950
I'd like to say
something to that.

947
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,252
No, no, no, that's okay.

948
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,987
Well, I'm just
going to leave.

949
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:09,292
Um, you know that ham
sandwich in the refrigerator?

950
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,861
Is that anybody's
in particular?

951
00:42:11,863 --> 01:24:23,724
Never mind.

952
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,033
So, Reeves and I are going
to open a restaurant.

953
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:17,901
Really?

954
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:19,936
Hey, good luck with that.

955
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:23,706
But, however, uh, due to
bad planning, uh, with the

956
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,210
money, uh, as you can see
we bought new clothes,

957
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,613
hence why I look like
Charlie brown, we have no

958
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:34,984
money for a motel and we
can't keep sleeping in the Van.

959
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:39,022
And Brad happened to tell
us about this great guest

960
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,089
house you have out back.

961
00:42:40,091 --> 01:25:21,800
Yeah, no. No, no.

962
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,759
You're not going to
sleep in my guest house.

963
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,227
No, no,l-just
listen, listen. Listen.

964
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,828
Let me finish.

965
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,830
In exchange for letting us
stay, we'll make dinner

966
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:50,733
for you and Brad
every night.

967
00:42:50,735 --> 01:25:41,468
No.

968
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,270
It's only going to be for
like a week or two and I

969
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,139
understand the whole thing
about role models, but

970
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:58,007
look, we no longer
look homeless.

971
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,876
That's a good start, right?

972
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:02,211
We'll be very respectful,
promise not to stay out

973
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,747
late, we won't curse.

974
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,282
Hold on. Fuckity fuck fuck fuck.

975
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:08,151
I just had to
get that out.

976
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,353
No drugs.

977
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,654
I won't stay out late.

978
00:43:11,656 --> 01:26:23,310
Did I mention that?

979
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:13,890
I may have mentioned it
twice but that's because

980
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,725
I'm not going to do it.

981
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,894
Did I tell you how pretty
your hair looks with the

982
00:43:17,896 --> 01:26:35,790
gray in it?

983
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:20,763
And I'm not just saying
that to make you feel good

984
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,864
about yourself.

985
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,767
It's very becoming.

986
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,904
Come on, help out
an old friend.

987
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:30,707
An old boyfriend?

988
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,842
A recent orphan?

989
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:33,710
That's right.

990
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,278
I'm sorry.

991
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,246
We have history.

992
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,748
I've been inside your...

993
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,316
Yeah, I'll be right
here if you need me.

994
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,251
Yeah, okay, no... boundaries!

995
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,653
I...

996
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,623
Okay, look at me.

997
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,692
My son is the most
important thing in my

998
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:52,328
life, and I'm going to
hold you to your promises.

999
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,796
I promise.

1000
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,131
Pinky promise?

1001
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,166
Please pinky
promise with me.

1002
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:57,934
Is that your pinky?

1003
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:58,835
I want a promise.

1004
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,803
Please somebody help me.

1005
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,804
You can stay.

1006
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,373
Thank you.

1007
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,174
Do you remember when we
used to hold pinkies?

1008
00:44:05,176 --> 01:28:10,350
What?

1009
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,410
-No, we never did this.
-W-we did this.

1010
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:08,945
No, that's your
other girlfriend.

1011
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,747
W-we did some other
stuff, but uh.

1012
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:11,748
That didn't invoke...

1013
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,750
I'll see ya later.

1014
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,789
So why you tell her we
don't do drugs anymore.

1015
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,391
'Cause we don't do drugs.

1016
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,226
We smoke weed.

1017
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:24,694
Weed's not a drug.

1018
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:26,162
Weed grows from the earth.

1019
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,730
This is the earth
we're smoking.

1020
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:29,666
We're giving back
to mother nature.

1021
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,201
Hello mom, welcome
to my mouth.

1022
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,110
Besides, we can
still smoke.

1023
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,980
We just can't
do it indoors.

1024
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:45,314
Gotta crack a
window or some shit.

1025
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,050
Can't let Debbie find out.

1026
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:49,285
Oh, and I told her we'd be
cooking for her and the

1027
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:50,286
kid every night.

1028
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,421
Fuck you did.

1029
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:52,755
Tonight's your night.

1030
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:53,956
I'll cook tomorrow.

1031
00:44:54,725 --> 01:29:49,449
Where you going?

1032
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:57,360
She gonna show me
the old neighborhood.

1033
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:58,861
Why can't I go?

1034
00:44:58,863 --> 01:29:57,724
'Cause you're cooking.

1035
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:03,099
Wait a minute, you're
fuckin' her so you should cook.

1036
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:05,334
Well, if I was fuckin' her
that'd be a great deal,

1037
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:07,103
but I don't think she
likes me like that anymore.

1038
00:45:07,105 --> 01:30:14,208
What ch...

1039
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:10,306
So so you say you're the
cook and I'll go fuck her.

1040
00:45:10,308 --> 01:30:20,614
You know what?

1041
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,875
That sounds like
a great plan.

1042
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,077
I'll see you
when we get back.

1043
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,311
Bye, fucker.

1044
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,347
Oh, no.

1045
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,884
Oh, yeah, that's my shit.

1046
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,252
Lisa Lisa.

1047
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:24,887
I can't believe how many
times you made me listen

1048
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,223
to can
you feel the beat!

1049
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,858
Can you
feel, can you feel,

1050
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,160
ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca.

1051
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:32,862
-Oh yeah.
-Oh man.

1052
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,097
I'm gonna make you
feel that beat.

1053
00:45:34,099 --> 01:31:09,960
Oh dear.

1054
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,834
Thank god Brad missed
this time in history.

1055
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,136
Y'know speaking of
history, what happened to

1056
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:42,905
Brad's, um, father?

1057
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,507
Oh wow, that was smooth.

1058
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:47,043
Didn't work out,
short story.

1059
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,177
Obviously it
didn't work out.

1060
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,979
What's the story story?

1061
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:50,847
How'd you meet him?

1062
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:51,748
What's his name?

1063
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,015
Who is this guy?

1064
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,786
His name's David, I met
him 14 years after you

1065
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:58,821
vanished from my life...

1066
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,158
I mean, I'm 16 years old,
the love of my life drives

1067
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,926
away, I never
see him again.

1068
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,862
You know, talk about
abandonment issues.

1069
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,197
You really screwed
me up, you know?

1070
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,501
If I knew you were dead or
that you were kidnapped it

1071
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:13,002
would make sense, but
there's always that

1072
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,505
possibility that you...

1073
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:17,106
You hated everything in
your life and you just

1074
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,842
wanted to run away.

1075
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,377
You run away from me.

1076
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,247
And every boyfriend
after that unconsciously

1077
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:26,849
I thought would
abandon me too.

1078
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,151
At least that's what my
therapist said when he

1079
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,219
broke up with me.

1080
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,057
I'm sorry.

1081
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:36,826
I don't know, it's not
like I intended for any of

1082
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,195
this to happen
either, you know?

1083
00:46:39,197 --> 01:33:18,392
It's not easy for me.

1084
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,565
I'm still trying to
comprehend what's going on.

1085
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,467
And I didn't mean to meet
Brad, it was an accident.

1086
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,169
He just came home early.

1087
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:47,970
Er-did he skip school?

1088
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,005
No, don't trip.

1089
00:46:49,007 --> 01:33:39,200
Not early like that.

1090
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,908
Like, I mean, earlier than i
thought he'd be home.

1091
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,378
I-hey, it is hard raising
a kid on your own, okay?

1092
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,113
And I worry. That's
what moms do.

1093
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:59,215
I worry that he's going to
break a bone or that he's

1094
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:01,517
going to fall into
the wrong crowd.

1095
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,586
He's not going to fall
into the wrong crowd.

1096
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,288
Well, you, you
don't know him.

1097
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:08,558
I know you, and
you're his mom.

1098
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,426
And with a mom like you
i think he's going to be

1099
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:11,494
just fine.

1100
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,064
Thanks.

1101
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,135
Oh shit, you hear that?

1102
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,837
Yeah, I do.

1103
00:47:20,839 --> 01:34:41,676
Okay, you ready?

1104
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:24,240
Yeah, no. Don't do it. Don't!

1105
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,575
I'm gonna pass you a wave.

1106
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:27,143
Don't do it!

1107
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,477
Here it comes! Catch it!

1108
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,346
If you don't release that
wave it's gonna come out

1109
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,148
in traffic!

1110
00:47:32,150 --> 01:35:04,298
Don't, please don't do it!

1111
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,383
You're gonna be making a
left turn and whoa!

1112
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:35,918
And then a u-turn.

1113
00:47:35,920 --> 01:35:11,838
You can't just have
waves floating around.

1114
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,189
Alright okay, okay. Here's my,
here's my move. Go, go, go...

1115
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,026
Hey, that's my move.

1116
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,028
I call that the
"twist and dash."

1117
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,298
Yo, are you ready?

1118
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,635
No, I'm searching for my
parents on the computer.

1119
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,370
It's called Facebook.
People list a bunch of

1120
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,905
useless information.

1121
00:47:55,907 --> 01:35:51,812
Like this guy right here.

1122
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,975
He's about to
brush his teeth.

1123
00:47:58,977 --> 00:48:00,376
Now he's done.

1124
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,545
Oh, I got a
friend request.

1125
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:03,980
Oh shit.

1126
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,249
From Nigeria?

1127
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,985
Maybe you have long lost
relatives in Nigeria.

1128
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,420
Well, he doesn't look
like anybody in my family

1129
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:12,421
alright, let's go.

1130
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:13,522
Alright.

1131
00:48:15,159 --> 01:36:30,316
Oh!

1132
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,393
Do I have the
wrong number?

1133
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,527
What is this?

1134
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,897
Do I, do I know you guys?

1135
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,499
Hey, that look like
fucking Sanchez, doesn't it?

1136
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,467
But older and uglier!

1137
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,601
- Yeah!

1138
00:48:25,603 --> 01:36:51,204
I can hear you!

1139
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:29,405
They created a game where
you can put your family in!

1140
00:48:29,407 --> 01:36:58,812
I'm not a game.

1141
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,375
That's crazy, that's
better than pac man or

1142
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:33,276
asteroids!

1143
00:48:33,278 --> 01:37:06,554
You see that?

1144
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:37,413
I'm not a game,
I'm on the Skype!

1145
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,248
He's on planet Skype!

1146
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,383
Where is this planet?

1147
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,951
Oh!

1148
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:43,286
We're on earth!

1149
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:45,321
What are your coordinates?

1150
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:46,989
Where the fuck
is my daughter?

1151
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:49,225
He's on planet Skype and
his daughter's missing!

1152
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:50,359
Oh shit!

1153
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,496
Oh my god, it's
you two idiots.

1154
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:55,197
We're businessmen now.

1155
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,198
Yep.

1156
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,500
We're opening businesses.

1157
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,035
I thought you
guys were dead.

1158
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:00,269
Anyway, good talking
to you, dirty.

1159
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,437
Do not disconnect me.

1160
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,538
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-Bye, buddy.

1161
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,006
Cabrones!

1162
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,676
And it's gonna be called
the chili pot, and we're

1163
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:08,244
just gonna serve chili.

1164
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:09,045
Yes.

1165
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,212
Just chili.

1166
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:11,414
That's gonna
pay the rent?

1167
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,316
20 bucks a bowl.

1168
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:14,417
For chili?

1169
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:17,219
Well, it has a
special ingredient.

1170
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:20,356
It has cannabis in it.

1171
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:23,960
No you're not.

1172
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,661
Oh yes we are. It's our recipe.

1173
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:28,698
You are not selling
pot in my property.

1174
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,566
Oh, no, no,
sir, it's okay.

1175
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:33,202
Marijuana is legal now.

1176
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,371
So are titty bars, but
you're not going to open

1177
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:38,307
up one of them in
my building either.

1178
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,209
Who would think thirty
years later there'd be

1179
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,111
still be racism
in America?

1180
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,346
That had nothing
to do with race.

1181
00:49:43,348 --> 01:39:26,694
Are you kidding me?

1182
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:46,315
The guy was white and
he was a landlord.

1183
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,651
Man, those confederate
types just don't like us.

1184
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,653
I don't think it had
anything to do with us.

1185
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,189
It was the weed
he didn't like.

1186
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:55,758
Look, I say this time we
try it again, just like

1187
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,362
the bank, but
leave out the weed.

1188
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:00,229
Okay.

1189
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,164
-Alright?
-Alright.

1190
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,065
Boom!

1191
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,533
Dudes!

1192
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:06,102
I don't think
we're gonna have to hide

1193
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:07,236
that part about the weed.

1194
00:50:07,238 --> 01:40:14,474
Mm.

1195
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:11,107
Hey, so, everything's
included in the kitchen,

1196
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:12,708
in the rent?

1197
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,478
'Cause it looks perfect to
make chili with weed in it.

1198
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,446
Yeah, it's all included.

1199
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,115
Chili with weed in it.

1200
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:20,583
Wow.

1201
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:23,552
Right on, you know, I once
replaced my bong water

1202
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,521
with soup.

1203
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,422
Yeah.

1204
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,060
Yeah, it was wild.

1205
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,129
You know, we'll take it.

1206
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,331
I don't know if I have
that bong anymore, man.

1207
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,466
-That was like, years ago.
-No, no, no...

1208
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:40,503
The whole place. Rent...

1209
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:42,304
Oh right, cool,
yeah, right.

1210
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,141
That'll be a
$5000 deposit.

1211
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:51,180
Hey, can you just,
hold it for us?

1212
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,082
We're just waiting on the
bank to give us the money.

1213
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,483
No, no can do.

1214
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,352
And just so you two know,
i got some other dudes

1215
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,187
coming in here tomorrow
afternoon to check out the

1216
00:50:58,189 --> 00:50:59,588
place, so you know...

1217
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,223
Peace out.

1218
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:04,593
Mm, but peace
though, really.

1219
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:06,495
No, I mean it. Peace out.

1220
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,164
I gotta get out of here.

1221
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,369
That place was great.

1222
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:15,137
You think the bank will
give us a loan while we're

1223
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:17,106
waiting on a loan?

1224
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:18,541
It's worth it.

1225
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:20,376
We could give it a shot.

1226
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:23,379
Yo, I just realized my
grandparents used to put

1227
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:26,082
away money for me every
year, and I wasn't allowed

1228
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:27,583
to touch it
until I was 21.

1229
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,118
Oh shit!

1230
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,487
You look like you
could pass for 21 now.

1231
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,255
I think so.

1232
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,391
It's gotta be like over
$4000 in that account.

1233
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:37,526
$4000?

1234
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:44,100
Bro, with the combining
interest loans

1235
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:47,736
buried in the dividends...

1236
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:49,705
That's thirty years?

1237
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:53,175
That's gotta be
like $400,000.

1238
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,311
Yeah.

1239
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,379
You just saved the day.

1240
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,186
Mmm!

1241
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,656
Guys, this is delicious.

1242
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:09,658
It's my mom's
secret recipe.

1243
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,428
What we used to do is make
it all from scratch, then

1244
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:13,796
we'd go to the store and
get some store-bought

1245
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:16,332
chili, put it in there to
add a little flavor to it.

1246
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,467
Wait, that's the
secret recipe?

1247
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,470
Yeah, was, up until now.

1248
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,672
Did you know that Clark
gable ate chili the night

1249
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:25,307
before he died?

1250
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,275
Where the hell'd
you hear that?

1251
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:27,276
On goggle.

1252
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:28,544
On.. What?

1253
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:32,448
On the computer, if you
look up, like, you can

1254
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,517
stuff words in like
"chili, goggle," and then

1255
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,318
-oh, no no, no.
-Uh, goggle...

1256
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,486
Google.

1257
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,389
Listen, I was, i
goggled last night.

1258
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,624
Yeah, goggle
sounds like a word.

1259
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,792
It's Google. Yeah, g-o-o-g-l-e.
Google.

1260
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:47,196
Well people spell tomato
different ways too.

1261
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:48,631
What the fuck is a Google?

1262
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,565
W-Google.

1263
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:50,566
It's like a search engine.

1264
00:52:50,568 --> 01:45:41,134
You search stuff in it.

1265
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:53,669
I didn't look for
a mechanic, okay?

1266
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,237
I was looking for chili.

1267
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,239
Yeah, you wear goggles,
you don't wear googles.

1268
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,675
Or you gotta wear
protective goggles, not

1269
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,544
protective googles.

1270
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,412
Y-but it, it's not
spelled "goggles."

1271
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,414
You don't get drunk and
have beer googles you have

1272
00:53:05,416 --> 01:46:10,830
beer goggles.

1273
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,683
They're not googgles. They're
not for your eyes.

1274
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,219
It's Google, like
g-o-o-g-l-e.

1275
00:53:10,221 --> 01:46:20,440
Then what is it for?

1276
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,522
-For searching for stuff!
-And what do you search with?

1277
00:53:13,524 --> 01:46:27,046
Your eyes.

1278
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,391
Checkmate, mother fucker.

1279
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,759
Agh!

1280
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,827
What's the matter?
What happened?

1281
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:22,765
Ah, I messed up my
arm at the bmx track.

1282
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:23,799
-Bmx track?
-Yeah, agh.

1283
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,235
Oh, who went?

1284
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:28,204
All of us. It was fun.

1285
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:29,572
All of you?

1286
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,973
What did I say about that?

1287
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,541
Well you said you weren't
going to take me!

1288
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,577
These guys said they
would, so I said okay.

1289
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,946
I wasn't going to take you
because it's dangerous.

1290
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:38,547
It's not dangerous,
it's bmx.

1291
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,515
It's fine.

1292
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:40,382
He got hurt!

1293
00:53:40,384 --> 01:47:20,766
He's old!

1294
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,451
Old people get hurt
doing anything.

1295
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,686
Okay, I'll be alright.

1296
00:53:43,688 --> 01:47:27,374
You're not helping.

1297
00:53:43,688 --> 01:47:27,374
Look, no it's
fine, mom. We were fine.

1298
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:48,757
We went, we had fun, we
relaxed, we were, we were

1299
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:49,792
wearing our pads
and helmets.

1300
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,260
-We were fine, right?
-Mhmm.

1301
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:52,828
If it's so safe, why do
you have to wear pads

1302
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,230
and helmets?

1303
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,232
My house, my rules.

1304
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:57,566
You never let me
do anything fun!

1305
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,935
You got, you like, keep
me cooped up in the house

1306
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,238
like I can't do anything,
like a fun-killer for

1307
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,305
crying out loud.

1308
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:04,740
Hey!

1309
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,912
What's with all the helmets
and pads nowadays anyway?

1310
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,014
Well that's what you do
now with dangerous things.

1311
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:13,682
Everyone wears
helmets and pads.

1312
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,551
Back in the day, the only
people that wore helmets

1313
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,720
and pads were retards and
women on their periods.

1314
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,658
Oh god, i-I'm raising
three children here.

1315
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,928
I think she's on her
helmet right now.

1316
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,466
Weber, correct.

1317
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:31,934
Harris.

1318
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,736
Can you just tell me
what my account is?

1319
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:37,706
Alright, thank you.

1320
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:42,478
Yo, I had $4,000
in that account.

1321
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,713
I had a quarter percent
interest over thirty years.

1322
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,515
I've got $4,400.

1323
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,817
The landlord guy
needs $5,000.

1324
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,052
We're fucked.

1325
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,954
You're gonna need
to sell the Van.

1326
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,290
I can't sell the Van, man.
That's my only Van!

1327
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,392
It was your only Van.

1328
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:57,826
Once we get the loan,
we'll buy back the Van.

1329
00:54:57,828 --> 01:49:55,654
But in the meantime,
we need the money.

1330
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:00,562
But in the meantime,

1331
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:01,563
we need the money.

1332
00:55:01,565 --> 01:50:03,128
Who the fuck is that?

1333
00:55:01,565 --> 01:50:03,128
Who the fuck is that?

1334
00:55:01,565 --> 01:50:03,128
Why are you mocking me?

1335
00:55:01,565 --> 01:50:03,128
Why are you mocking me?

1336
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:08,003
It's Brad's iPad, this
thing, it's....

1337
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,004
It's Brad's iPad...

1338
00:55:09,006 --> 01:50:19,000
It repeats
everything you say.

1339
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,874
It repeats everything you say.

1340
00:55:11,876 --> 01:50:23,750
I just said that.

1341
00:55:11,876 --> 00:55:14,343
I just said that.

1342
00:55:14,345 --> 01:50:28,688
Do you want to smoke?

1343
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:16,879
Do you want to smoke?

1344
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:18,314
Well clearly I do.

1345
00:55:18,316 --> 01:50:36,630
Well clearly I do.

1346
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:23,352
Look, blow some weed into
it, blow weed into it.

1347
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,587
-Now, now what?
-Do you feel high?

1348
00:55:25,589 --> 01:50:51,176
Are you a high-pad?

1349
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,623
Are you a high-pad?

1350
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,939
How much you get?

1351
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,474
Seven hundred bucks.

1352
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:46,842
The fuck?

1353
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,410
That's what I said.

1354
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:51,747
Apparently the guy from
the list of Craig said

1355
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:54,383
that's all he truck is
worth, because, you know,

1356
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:57,119
vintage, and, you know,
cheetos everywhere.

1357
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:59,621
I kind of trust him, too,
because Craig wouldn't put

1358
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:01,857
a list together of
people he didn't trust.

1359
00:56:01,859 --> 01:52:03,716
Who the fuck is Craig?

1360
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:06,061
Some guy, he has a list of
everybody's shit, and they

1361
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:08,063
just go to him to sell it.

1362
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,865
Where do you find this
guy, does he have a store?

1363
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,901
I dunno, Craig,
he's on the um...

1364
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:13,936
The Webber.

1365
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:15,738
The world wide web.

1366
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,039
That computer shit
we were lookin' at?

1367
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,908
Yeah, it was like
something about twitting?

1368
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,679
Apparently the people
who twit go to face...

1369
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,782
I haven't figured it out
but Craig knows everybody.

1370
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:29,852
You can get everything
from skis to a blow job.

1371
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,987
Ooh, we should've
gotten blow jobs.

1372
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,690
I gotta shit.

1373
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,693
Try to use the
toilet this time.

1374
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:38,594
Right.

1375
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,529
-Hi.
-Hey.

1376
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:42,064
Hi. Does it look like
I'm flying?

1377
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,866
It does, superman.

1378
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,535
I want to talk to you
about the other morning.

1379
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:47,803
Oh.

1380
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,037
You were fine.

1381
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,606
No, I was wrong.

1382
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:52,541
You guys have gone out of
your way to include Brad.

1383
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:53,909
And I appreciate it.

1384
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,578
And now you're letting him
help with the restaurant

1385
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,782
stuff, and,
it's very cool.

1386
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:02,451
Interesting
concept, by the way.

1387
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:03,185
Concept?

1388
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:04,153
Mhmm.

1389
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:05,654
What did he say?

1390
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:08,757
Well, you're only going
to serve chili, right?

1391
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,092
That's all he said?

1392
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,126
What else should he say?

1393
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,094
Nothing.

1394
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,629
Nope, nothing.

1395
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:14,797
Dinner tonight?

1396
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,432
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1397
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,000
You don't have to
cook dinner tonight.

1398
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:19,902
I'm going out
with the girls.

1399
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:21,203
Oh.

1400
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:22,638
Yeah.

1401
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,605
Okay.

1402
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,940
I'll see you later.

1403
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,508
No problem.

1404
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,457
You guys should take
me bungee jumping

1405
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:43,225
this weekend.

1406
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:45,861
What the fuck is
bungee jumping?

1407
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:46,795
I dunno.

1408
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,030
Is that in your underwear?

1409
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:49,665
What the fuck is
bungee jumping?

1410
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:51,700
You know, like when you
jump off a bridge with,

1411
00:57:51,702 --> 01:55:43,402
like, a bungee.

1412
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:54,670
Why do you say that like
we should know this shit?

1413
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,004
Why would you do.. Why
would the fuck you

1414
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:58,006
-jump off a bridge?
-'Cause it's fun.

1415
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,508
You know that we're
not white, right?

1416
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,210
-Yes, exactly.
-That's not shit we would do.

1417
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:04,012
Why the fuck would you
jump off a bridge?

1418
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:05,514
I got to check
with your mom.

1419
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,749
I mean, you don't
have to tell her.

1420
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,718
Uh-uh, I promised i
wouldn't let you do any

1421
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,019
fuckin' dumb shit.

1422
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:11,987
The fuck?

1423
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,088
It's bros before hoes.

1424
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,756
Thank you.

1425
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,024
Hello?

1426
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,261
Hey, it's the
best bud guy.

1427
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,128
Hey bud.

1428
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,664
Bud.

1429
00:58:22,666 --> 01:56:45,330
How old is he?

1430
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,534
What, are you hitting'
on me, pervert?

1431
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:28,537
I can't conduct business
if anyone around is underage.

1432
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,873
You're conducting
business with us, boy.

1433
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,975
Watch your god damn tone.

1434
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,580
He's 21.

1435
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:40,849
Listen here rockford
files, you take your case

1436
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,017
somewhere else.

1437
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,986
His parents are midgets.

1438
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,755
The keebler family.

1439
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:49,191
That's keebler sutherland.

1440
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,659
Keeble it to yourself.

1441
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:53,795
If you have a good
girl, she's a keebler.

1442
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:55,697
Selling chili
with weed in it?

1443
00:58:55,699 --> 01:57:51,396
That's brilliant.

1444
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:00,269
You guys are going to
need about ten flavors to start.

1445
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:06,275
I got the super skunk,
og kush, white widow,

1446
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:08,610
blueberry kush...

1447
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,680
- Which one's the best?

1448
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,549
All of this
stuff is chronic.

1449
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,184
Then we'll take all of it.

1450
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:19,121
And those free little
pens that come with it.

1451
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,924
My friend, this
is a vaporizer.

1452
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:23,292
Whoa-whoa, watch
that vaporizer.

1453
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:24,793
Whoa, hey, I don't
want to lose my friend.

1454
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:28,997
Your laser...

1455
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:31,033
The force is not with you!

1456
00:59:31,035 --> 01:59:02,680
It's not a star
trek thing, guys.

1457
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:35,571
Just push down on the
button, inhale and try it out.

1458
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,174
Oh, in my mouth.

1459
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,076
These new designs, they
let you regulate the vapor

1460
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,278
density so you get more
hits per cartridge.

1461
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,080
Mm.

1462
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,982
Oh, that's good
stuff, hold on.

1463
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,584
Smooth.

1464
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,319
Oh, hey, easy guys.

1465
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:52,087
You barely have to hit it.

1466
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,292
That's what she said.

1467
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:00,996
I'm hitting it
from the front.

1468
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,166
Great thing about these
new models, vaporization

1469
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:05,334
only happens
when you inhale.

1470
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:07,002
-So, rule of thumb...
-Mmm!

1471
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:09,104
Use about maybe half
the weed that you would

1472
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,205
smoking in a joint.

1473
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:11,707
Half?

1474
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,042
And the high is stronger.

1475
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:16,144
Mhmm.

1476
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:21,717
Better high, less money,
and completely healthy.

1477
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:25,954
I tell you what, I feel so
fucking healthy right now.

1478
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,791
Fantastically healthy.

1479
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,963
I think I'm
doing mine wrong.

1480
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:44,106
How could you be 47 and
do that without falling?

1481
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:46,742
Age ain't nothin'
but a number!

1482
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:48,210
Okay, okay.

1483
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,311
Are you ready?

1484
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,812
Well, I haven't
done this in...

1485
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,214
I haven't done
this in years, so.

1486
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:53,215
Okay...

1487
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:54,216
-Woo!
-Whoa!

1488
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:55,651
Don't trip.

1489
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:56,752
Why you trippin', fool?

1490
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:00,022
You've got it.

1491
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,759
You've got it.

1492
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,927
Pontiac or Toyota,
who was that?

1493
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,706
Hey guys.

1494
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:18,974
Hi.

1495
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:21,109
This place looks, uh...

1496
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,444
Fun.

1497
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,447
What's this the
donations jar?

1498
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:27,983
Oh that's for my
friend on Facebook.

1499
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:30,152
Oh, the one from Nigeria.

1500
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:31,453
Yes!

1501
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:33,455
Yes! How'd you know? Nasim!

1502
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:35,691
Yeah, it's a scam.

1503
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:39,227
That is exactly what
nasim said you would say.

1504
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,830
It is a scam.

1505
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:43,065
Yeah.

1506
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:44,866
'Cause he knows
it's a scam.

1507
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,036
No, he needs a
foot transplant.

1508
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,440
Anyway, this is bullshit.

1509
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:54,843
Let's get somebody to
help us paint, man.

1510
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,344
We don't have
any money left.

1511
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,013
But we have weed.

1512
01:01:58,015 --> 01:01:59,815
Weed is currency.

1513
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,220
Yo, next time we give
these guys the weed

1514
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,722
after they paint.

1515
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:08,290
Next time we
pay 'em in cash.

1516
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,192
We don't have any
more cash, remember?

1517
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:11,827
And we don't have
any more weed.

1518
01:02:11,829 --> 02:04:23,656
What?

1519
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:15,230
How the fuck are we gonna
make chili with weed in it

1520
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,299
if we don't have any weed
to put in the chili?

1521
01:02:17,301 --> 02:04:34,600
I know.

1522
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,801
That's why I called
the best bud guy.

1523
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,837
So, problem solved.

1524
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,472
Problem not solved.

1525
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:25,207
We don't have
any more money.

1526
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:26,241
What?

1527
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:28,844
What?

1528
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:30,979
You just now
telling me this?

1529
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:33,482
I just now told
you just now.

1530
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,283
Hello!

1531
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:36,785
-Oh shit!
-Shit!

1532
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,523
I have bad news.

1533
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,058
Well, just tell me
the good news first.

1534
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,526
Oh, there is no good news.

1535
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:45,961
What do you mean
there's no good news?

1536
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:48,530
Well, oh, actually
there's good news for me.

1537
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50,532
I can't give you
gentlemen the loan.

1538
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,067
But you said we
had good credit.

1539
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:54,269
I said it looks like you
have really good credit.

1540
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,872
Turns out you don't
have any credit at all.

1541
01:02:56,874 --> 02:05:53,746
Yeah, but...

1542
01:02:56,874 --> 01:03:00,008
Can't they look at it
like, we haven't missed a

1543
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,943
payment in like
three decades?

1544
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,079
They could, but they
won't, because that's not

1545
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:05,514
how it works.

1546
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,817
Banks don't give loans to
people without credit.

1547
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:12,053
So you brought your big
Wally-happy ass down here,

1548
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:15,223
granola-eatin',
folgers-coffee drinkin',

1549
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,525
to tell us this shit?

1550
01:03:16,527 --> 02:06:33,052
Well, it wasn't a problem.

1551
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:19,928
I had the afternoon free
since I didn't have to do

1552
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,296
your paperwork.

1553
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,899
Well, I'm gonna go
get some frogurt.

1554
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,400
Bye guys!

1555
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,135
What a frogin' asshole.

1556
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,003
See, I told you.

1557
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:30,238
Racism is still alive.

1558
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,273
Still alive!

1559
01:03:31,275 --> 02:07:02,548
We're fucked.

1560
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:36,878
He can't give us a loan
because we ain't got no credit.

1561
01:03:36,880 --> 02:07:13,758
Gentlemen!

1562
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,983
All I need is a signature
and a payment and we're all set.

1563
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,920
Right, um, about
the payment thing.

1564
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,525
A funny thing happened
with the, you know how

1565
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,027
business is, you know.

1566
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,163
Got the signature,
but the payment...

1567
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,366
Can I be straight?

1568
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:02,270
There's been a..
Accounting error.

1569
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:07,442
Yeah, so we're gonna
have to get this on...

1570
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:08,577
Credit?

1571
01:04:08,579 --> 02:08:17,156
Credit?

1572
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:11,613
Okay, let me explain
to you something about

1573
01:04:11,615 --> 02:08:23,228
credit, alright?

1574
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:14,516
I gave you credit in
the first delivery.

1575
01:04:14,518 --> 02:08:29,034
Still haven't gotten
payment for that.

1576
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,587
So, when I get payment for
that, you get some more weed.

1577
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:20,288
Look, man. Look around, okay?

1578
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,190
We're just about to
open this place, right?

1579
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,459
We're gonna be busy, busy,
making money, chili,

1580
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:26,328
money, chili,
weed, everything.

1581
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,096
We're gonna be successful,
we're gonna be your number

1582
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:29,598
one people.

1583
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,234
We're gonna be your...

1584
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:33,101
Thing!

1585
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,236
Economics.

1586
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:37,038
Hold on, hold on,
let me handle this.

1587
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,542
Look, you're a
businessman.

1588
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,510
I'm a businessman.

1589
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:44,512
Business is how
business is.

1590
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:46,414
That's how this
country was built.

1591
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:47,382
Capiche?

1592
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:50,318
Pilgrims helped
the Indians.

1593
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,555
The Indians helped
the pilgrims.

1594
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,258
We're just asking for the
same deal the Indians got.

1595
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,360
And not my Indians.

1596
01:04:58,362 --> 01:04:59,995
The other ones.

1597
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,329
Okay, let me explain
to you guys a little

1598
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,431
something about the
deal the Indians got.

1599
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:06,968
Pilgrims took their land,
gave 'em blankets covered

1600
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,236
in smallpox.

1601
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,271
Allegedly.

1602
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:10,205
Smallpox?

1603
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:11,072
That's free.

1604
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,474
Weed? Costs money.

1605
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:14,442
No cash, no grass.

1606
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:16,478
What are you, a
fuckin' poet now?

1607
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,616
I don't need smallpox!

1608
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,420
These people, these are
not good businesspeople.

1609
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:31,593
Did you know that Bruce
Lee was actually born in

1610
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,995
San Francisco?

1611
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:36,097
I did know this.

1612
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,233
I can't believe i
messed up on counting.

1613
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:39,434
I can, you were wasted.

1614
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,568
We're always wasted.

1615
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,437
Maybe that's our problem.

1616
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:45,640
You're gonna have to ask
Debbie for the money.

1617
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,409
Are you fucking crazy?

1618
01:05:47,411 --> 02:11:34,820
Yeah, picture that.

1619
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:50,145
"Oh hey Deb, can I borrow
a few thousand bucks so I

1620
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:51,613
can buy some weed?"

1621
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,949
Yeah. She'll lose her shit and
kick us out of her place.

1622
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:54,983
We'll end up homeless.

1623
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:56,251
Tell her it's for
something else!

1624
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,619
I can't lie to her.

1625
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,388
You been lying
this whole time!

1626
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,157
Yeah, well i
don't like it.

1627
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,060
Listen, she's
against weed.

1628
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:07,429
You don't have
a future, okay?

1629
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:09,297
She's our last hope.

1630
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,200
Roll the dice, man.

1631
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:12,734
Hey guys.

1632
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:13,969
Debbie!

1633
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,303
-Hey!
-Hey, hello.

1634
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,571
Speaking of nice shirts.

1635
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:19,407
-Hi!
-Hey!

1636
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:21,309
So, uh, what are
you doing here?

1637
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,444
I took off work early.

1638
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:23,712
Brad told me
you'd be here.

1639
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:25,080
Cool, Brad told her.

1640
01:06:25,082 --> 02:12:51,620
Look at that.

1641
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:29,184
Well, I told Brad that i
would take him skydiving.

1642
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:31,286
Alright.

1643
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:32,620
Off to the gym.

1644
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:34,289
You guys have fun.

1645
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,157
Okay, well...

1646
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,059
Look at you,
skipping work, huh?

1647
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:39,060
Sit down.

1648
01:06:39,062 --> 02:13:19,220
It's a beautiful day.

1649
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:40,562
Let's go for a walk.

1650
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:41,262
Alright.

1651
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,672
So, you just...

1652
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,173
Took the day off
work today? Just like that?

1653
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,742
Just like that.

1654
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:55,643
I mean, a few weeks ago i
would've never considered

1655
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:59,114
that, but if my
boss gets annoyed...

1656
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:00,682
So what, right?

1657
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:01,649
I guess.

1658
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,418
What changed?

1659
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,654
I dunno, I just feel like
i haven't been living my life.

1660
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:09,524
Forgot how to have fun
along the way, know what I mean?

1661
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,592
I do.

1662
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,627
I do know what you mean.

1663
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:14,029
You have a lot
do with that.

1664
01:07:14,031 --> 02:14:28,600
I do?

1665
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:16,798
I'm the reason you
played hooky today?

1666
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,702
Yes! I mean look at you, you
don't worry about anything.

1667
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,404
So you think I don't
have any worries?

1668
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,239
What do you have
to worry about?

1669
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:30,378
Oh, okay. Your secrets again.

1670
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,214
We didn't have enough
money to finish the restaurant.

1671
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,383
Can't you get a loan?

1672
01:07:35,385 --> 02:15:10,768
Well...

1673
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:38,620
Pelican point bank was
going to give us a loan,

1674
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:41,689
but then, we don't have
any credit, so no.

1675
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:43,224
Well, you know what?

1676
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,593
There are other banks.

1677
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:47,629
Well, where're you going?

1678
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:48,630
Woop, woop!

1679
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:50,398
Wait, now you
want to dance?

1680
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,766
I want to talk!

1681
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,469
You're afraid that she's
not going to accept you

1682
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:55,470
because you're a pothead,

1683
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:57,539
and in my book,
that's chicken.

1684
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:59,741
Okay, number one,
I'm not a chicken...

1685
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:02,243
Guys. I got you the loan!

1686
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:04,612
-Haaa!
-What?

1687
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,581
My friend Julie works at
the pelican point bank.

1688
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,383
She spoke with the
original loan officer, and

1689
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:10,718
he still likes your idea.

1690
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,687
No, they already said no
and we don't have any

1691
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:13,688
credit anyways.

1692
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,223
I'm gonna co-sign!

1693
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:16,624
Oh! God, no.

1694
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,226
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-No, no, no.

1695
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:19,527
Your credit is no
longer an issue.

1696
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:21,162
All you have to do is
go in, give your

1697
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:22,831
little presentation and
you're all set.

1698
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,466
I am so excited for you!

1699
01:08:24,468 --> 01:08:25,834
Me too!

1700
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:27,635
Pow!

1701
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,704
I love it when
Debbie gets excited.

1702
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,574
Well that went well.

1703
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:34,342
No the fuck it didn't!

1704
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:36,144
She thinks we're opening
up a normal restaurant.

1705
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:37,178
We are!

1706
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,146
I gotta get her to cancel.

1707
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:40,115
No! Whoa!

1708
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,484
I can't have her sign
this shit under false pretenses.

1709
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:45,420
Deb?

1710
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,323
Debbie, I...

1711
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:51,292
Hoo, I...

1712
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,193
Oh my...

1713
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:54,262
G-good god.

1714
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:56,764
Um, d... Deb.

1715
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,734
Debbie Deb Deb,
dooby dub da...

1716
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:01,903
God damn, you
look fantastic.

1717
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:03,571
I uh...

1718
01:09:06,175 --> 02:18:12,349
I.. I just gotta...

1719
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:09,711
I just want to talk to
you about something real quick.

1720
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:14,482
I t-tits, talk, toody,
tit-tot-tot-too-dot tits, talk.

1721
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,485
Jesus Christ, I wanted to
tell you your tits have

1722
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,288
dropped perfectly
over the years.

1723
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,556
I, um...

1724
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:23,725
I haven't seen, s...

1725
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:26,794
These, or anything this...

1726
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:28,429
Shade.

1727
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:32,333
I was with Reeves for a
long time, and uh, this is

1728
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,902
far better than I...

1729
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:37,172
We really need to work
on your compliments.

1730
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,617
Debbie?

1731
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:50,919
Deb?

1732
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:52,720
Debbie?

1733
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,455
Oh for fuck's sakes.

1734
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,595
Yo, where's Debbie?

1735
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:01,930
You didn't tell
her, did you?

1736
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:06,434
I tried
to, but she wanted to fuck,

1737
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:08,770
and I didn't want to be rude.

1738
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:10,939
She showed up naked and i
showed up with a boner.

1739
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:13,775
Well, she left you
a little message.

1740
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,312
Sorry I can't be at
the bank with you.

1741
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:18,646
Good luck today.

1742
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,381
Fuck.

1743
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,450
I gotta call her, dude.

1744
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:23,451
And tell her what?

1745
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,485
The truth.

1746
01:10:24,487 --> 02:20:48,972
The truth?

1747
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:26,721
Look, you gonna
sabotage us.

1748
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,256
I'm not trying to
sabotage, I mean, she put

1749
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:29,490
up too much fucking money.

1750
01:10:29,492 --> 02:20:58,982
Trust me.

1751
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,759
Let me call
her real quick.

1752
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:38,733
Fucking voicemail!

1753
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:39,867
Good.

1754
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:41,269
We gotta cancel
this meeting.

1755
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:42,570
Listen, this
is all I have.

1756
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,305
I sold my Van. I have nothing!

1757
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:45,974
I don't want to fuck her
over, and I don't want to

1758
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:47,675
fuck you over, you're
my best friend.

1759
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,677
But we gotta tell somebody
the truth somewhere.

1760
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,379
We gotta figure
something out.

1761
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:53,748
Wait a minute.

1762
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,583
I might have something.

1763
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:59,020
There's this thing on
here called powerpoint.

1764
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:03,024
With a few adjustments,
and some editing

1765
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:04,826
cut-pastes...

1766
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:05,860
Can I ask you something?

1767
01:11:05,862 --> 02:22:11,722
Hm?

1768
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,930
How the fuck'd you get
so good on the computer?

1769
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,432
Mrs. hunt's typing class.

1770
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,668
Damn, I should've
paid attention.

1771
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,803
I kept staring at
Mrs. hunt's...

1772
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:17,005
Legs.

1773
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,542
I got it.

1774
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,292
I really wish Debbie
would've called me back

1775
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:38,593
this morning.

1776
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,428
It's actually
better like this.

1777
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:43,665
Once she sees we've turned
around these stiff types,

1778
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,534
she'll be ready
to jump on board.

1779
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,002
Shall we begin
the presentation?

1780
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:50,004
Oh, we're not
ready just yet.

1781
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,975
God, this chili
is god damn...

1782
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,743
It's good!

1783
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,478
You spiked it!

1784
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,548
I put a little
product in it.

1785
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,783
How much?

1786
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:05,053
Enough to get the loan.

1787
01:12:05,055 --> 01:12:06,321
Yummy!

1788
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:07,422
Can I have some more?

1789
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:08,323
Oh, ye...

1790
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:11,025
You, here, certainly can.

1791
01:12:11,027 --> 02:24:22,520
Oh, heh, thank you.

1792
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:15,530
I-i see you gentlemen
have a loan guarantor,

1793
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:17,532
Ms. Sanchez?

1794
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:19,901
Uh, she can't be here
today, but she's ready to

1795
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:22,003
sign the papers upon
the bank's approval?

1796
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,905
Do we have any
bigger spoons?

1797
01:12:23,907 --> 01:12:27,642
Okay, time for
the presentation.

1798
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:31,045
This is our
projected income.

1799
01:12:31,047 --> 02:25:02,920
Yep.

1800
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,781
-These are beans...
-Uh, hold on. Go back a slide.

1801
01:12:33,783 --> 02:25:07,564
Hm?

1802
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:39,420
Do you have any actual numbers
for your projected profit?

1803
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:40,722
No.

1804
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,957
But it will look like
this, the money.

1805
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,959
-We'll stack it better.
-Yeah.

1806
01:12:44,961 --> 02:25:29,920
These are some of
the ingredients.

1807
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:51,032
Mainly beans, tomatoes,
this is Greg, he's a cow,

1808
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:52,700
-um, corn.
-Corn.

1809
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,502
-Onions...
-Uh, whoa whoa whoa.

1810
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:57,605
Uh, stop the clock, uh,
go back a slide or two.

1811
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,474
-Hm? Hm? The, the corn?
-No,just one more, one more.

1812
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:00,808
Greg.

1813
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,976
Forward.

1814
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:02,977
Go forward one slide.

1815
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:03,978
-Hm? Th-this one?
-Back.

1816
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:04,779
Back, back back back!

1817
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:05,780
Uh, hm...

1818
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:07,448
I'm sorry, is that...

1819
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,783
Is that marijuana?

1820
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,418
It's...

1821
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,454
Legal cannabis?

1822
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:14,655
Alright, can we get
the lights back on?

1823
01:13:14,657 --> 01:13:15,757
-No, no, no!
-Sir, sir!

1824
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:18,025
Let me understand
something here.

1825
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:23,965
You're gonna sell chili
that has marijuana in it?

1826
01:13:23,967 --> 02:26:47,932
Yes!

1827
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,702
That's why it's
called the chili pot.

1828
01:13:27,704 --> 01:13:29,404
Chili.

1829
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,005
Pot.

1830
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:32,039
Chili pot.

1831
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,808
Alright, I think
we can stop here.

1832
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:37,445
A pot restaurant is not
the sort of establishment

1833
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:40,848
that our bank can support.

1834
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,450
It would be bad
for our image.

1835
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:44,419
Actually, I was going
to address that.

1836
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:45,553
Can we continue?

1837
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:46,854
I really don't
see the point.

1838
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:47,922
Please.

1839
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,457
There's more chili.

1840
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:50,191
Huh?

1841
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:51,559
Please, there's
lots of it.

1842
01:13:51,561 --> 02:27:43,120
Okay, alright.

1843
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:53,895
Alright, go for
it, go for it.

1844
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:57,031
Just... that's
very full, alright.

1845
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,634
Weed has been a part

1846
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:02,537
of our history and our fabric.

1847
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,772
When Washington was
crossing the Delaware, do

1848
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,641
you think he was sober?

1849
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,543
I mean, who stands
up in a boat?

1850
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:09,610
A high man.

1851
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,914
George Washington,
weed smoker.

1852
01:14:12,916 --> 02:28:25,830
Ben Franklin.

1853
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:16,484
Do you think that "hey,
let's go fly a kite in the

1854
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:19,587
middle of a storm"
was a sober idea?

1855
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:22,123
That's where the term
"high as a kite" comes from.

1856
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,057
Ah!

1857
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:26,027
Ben Franklin, bong owner.

1858
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:27,862
There's his supplier.

1859
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,997
Cancer!

1860
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,499
The big c.

1861
01:14:31,501 --> 01:14:33,134
Many people in
this town have it.

1862
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,603
And are going to
die from it soon.

1863
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:38,139
Shouldn't they have access
to something that's going

1864
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:41,209
to make the time
pass slower?

1865
01:14:41,211 --> 02:29:22,420
Weed does that.

1866
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:45,079
Picture thousands of
tombstones that read:

1867
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:49,016
"My death was not quick,
thanks to pelican point bank."

1868
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:51,586
Marijuana: Gateway
drug, right?

1869
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:54,922
Wrong!

1870
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:59,994
Marijuana is a
gateway to pancakes.

1871
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,629
Cinnabon.

1872
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,031
Anything ending in -ito.

1873
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:07,969
Fritos, doritos,
cheetos, burritos.

1874
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:11,072
Hundreds of foods that may
not be palatable to the

1875
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:12,740
normal tastebud.

1876
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:15,142
But to somebody on
marijuana, delicious.

1877
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:18,145
And they go out hunting
for it night after night.

1878
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:23,084
Pelican point bank:
Economy stimulator.

1879
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:27,555
Marijuana is not only
embraced by the outcast now.

1880
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:29,223
It is mainstream.

1881
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:32,860
Some former potheads and
current are doing very

1882
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,963
well for themselves
right now.

1883
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:37,632
Woody Harrelson.

1884
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:38,900
Sean penn.

1885
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:40,535
Snoop dogg.

1886
01:15:40,537 --> 02:31:21,072
I thought you
couldn't make it.

1887
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:44,071
- My meeting got out early
-cheech & Chong.

1888
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:46,007
Merle haggard.

1889
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:47,642
Bill Clinton.

1890
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,011
You didn't tell me it was
a marijuana restaurant.

1891
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,548
What?

1892
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:58,286
Barack Obama, the
commander in chief.

1893
01:15:58,288 --> 01:16:00,021
God bless this
conference room,

1894
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:03,090
and god bless America.

1895
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,835
Debbie!

1896
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:15,770
Debbie!

1897
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:17,071
I was gonna tell you.

1898
01:16:17,073 --> 02:32:35,440
When?

1899
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,640
When were you
gonna tell me?

1900
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:21,909
After I co-signed
the loan?

1901
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,011
I, um...

1902
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:25,179
I know this looks bad.

1903
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,681
Oh my god.

1904
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:29,216
You've been lying to
me this whole time.

1905
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:32,353
I trusted you
around my son.

1906
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:33,287
I don't know what to say.

1907
01:16:33,289 --> 02:33:06,576
How about "I'm sorry.

1908
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:36,757
I'm sorry I didn't realize
how my actions would

1909
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,059
affect people."

1910
01:16:38,061 --> 02:33:17,200
How about this one?

1911
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:42,897
"I'm sorry you found weed in
Brad's backpack this morning."

1912
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:44,298
Yeah, I did.

1913
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,834
-Listen...
-No, I'm done listening to you.

1914
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,236
You're a fucking
irresponsible man-child.

1915
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,639
You suck me in, you make
me think I can live this

1916
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:54,308
carefree day-to-day life,
but you forgot to tell me

1917
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,143
the secret.

1918
01:16:56,145 --> 01:17:00,181
It only works if
you don't grow up.

1919
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:01,983
But you wouldn't
realize that.

1920
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:03,217
You didn't think that
through, because that

1921
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:05,052
takes reflection.

1922
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,691
You know what
really hurts?

1923
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:13,060
I started to
believe in us again.

1924
01:17:44,860 --> 02:35:29,719
Hey!

1925
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:47,728
-Hey.
-Did you get the loan?

1926
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,130
No.

1927
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:51,666
I left a note for
your mom inside.

1928
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:53,834
W-wait, you're leaving?

1929
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,104
Your mom found out
about the restaurant.

1930
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,940
She's pissed.

1931
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,742
Says we're bad
role models.

1932
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:02,843
She said that?

1933
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,311
She's right.

1934
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,313
We're fuckin' idiots.

1935
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:08,049
And do yourself a favor
and stop hiding your weed

1936
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:09,250
in your backpack.

1937
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:10,451
She went through my stuff?

1938
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:12,219
Are you kidding me?

1939
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:13,387
God.

1940
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:14,889
That's what the
note's about.

1941
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,290
I told her the weed was
mine, that I put

1942
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:18,392
it in there, you didn't know
anything about it.

1943
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:19,293
So you're good.

1944
01:18:19,295 --> 02:36:38,588
No, no, no, no.

1945
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:22,129
You can't say that, because,
you gotta go get that note.

1946
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:23,764
Because if you say that,
she's not gonna let you

1947
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:24,799
guys come back.

1948
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:25,800
It's too late, buddy.

1949
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:27,368
No, this is bullshit, man!

1950
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,003
I was smoking weed long
before you guys ever

1951
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:30,404
showed up, alright?

1952
01:18:30,406 --> 02:37:00,810
This is my fault.

1953
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,973
I'll take the rap, I'll
tell her the honest truth.

1954
01:18:32,975 --> 02:37:05,948
It'll be fine.

1955
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:35,376
She'll let you
guys stay, okay?

1956
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,279
Listen, when you get
older you'll understand.

1957
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:40,748
Right now, just, things
aren't as clear-cut as

1958
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,783
they seem.

1959
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:44,251
Besides, what's really
important is your mom

1960
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:46,487
believes in your innocence
rather than mine.

1961
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:49,356
Here's the key.

1962
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,804
Yo, this shit was way
easier to do 30 years ago.

1963
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,409
Woof.

1964
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:11,312
Still mad at me?

1965
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,815
Dude, I can't believe
you left me, man.

1966
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:17,852
It would've worked if you
just waited a couple of seconds.

1967
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:19,987
Look, man.

1968
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,357
I had to do something.

1969
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,227
There'll be other banks,
but there's only one Debbie.

1970
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:28,796
I had to take a shot.

1971
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:32,833
If it makes you feel any
better, I lost her too.

1972
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,773
Does make me feel
a little better.

1973
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:42,176
I didn't want to lose
my best friend as well.

1974
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,280
Just love me, man.

1975
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:48,883
-Stop.
-Won't you hug me?

1976
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:52,319
We slept together for 30
years, you won't hug me now?

1977
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:54,555
Stop! You're making a pbs
moment, man!

1978
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:56,090
I'm not inside you!

1979
01:19:57,894 --> 01:19:59,894
-Damn it.
-Holy shit!

1980
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:01,962
-What?
-Look at that!

1981
01:20:01,964 --> 02:40:03,926
What?

1982
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:04,365
Right there, where
the light is!

1983
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:06,066
You mean all that
weed by the tree?

1984
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:07,434
Oh shit!

1985
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:09,570
Weed never used to
grow there before.

1986
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:13,207
Maybe the bird droppings
have been dropping on the

1987
01:20:13,209 --> 01:20:15,209
tree acting as fertilizer.

1988
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:17,812
No, there used to
be trees there.

1989
01:20:17,814 --> 01:20:19,513
Now the sun can get
through, and it's

1990
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:22,082
reflecting off
the rock and...

1991
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:23,918
Growing takes reflection!

1992
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,386
Three times
three is eight!

1993
01:20:25,388 --> 02:40:50,774
Debbie said it to me.

1994
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:28,289
I didn't know what the
fuck she was talking about.

1995
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:30,558
I don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

1996
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,393
Because there's no trees
there, the sunlight can

1997
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:36,130
get through, it reflects off the
rock, and it feeds the weed.

1998
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:38,499
If we clear all these
trees away on the side of

1999
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,067
this hill...

2000
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,136
With all that light...

2001
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:43,504
We won't need a loan!

2002
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:44,438
Exactly.

2003
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,274
More weed! Oh shit!

2004
01:20:47,276 --> 01:20:48,609
We'll be weed farmers!

2005
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:49,977
-Ahhh!
-Ahhh!

2006
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:51,545
We gonna be rich!

2007
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:53,047
Ahh!

2008
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,635
Alright, just put
that on your table sir.

2009
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,137
We need a chili thai
kush and a Maui wow-y

2010
01:21:17,139 --> 02:42:34,276
pineapple.

2011
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:20,908
We're out of all that,
can you pass it through.

2012
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,476
Oh, okay, well...

2013
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,044
I'll let him know.

2014
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,415
Oh.

2015
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,317
-Hey.
-Hi.

2016
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,452
Yep, this is it.

2017
01:21:31,454 --> 01:21:32,653
Yes, this is it.

2018
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:34,154
This is it.

2019
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:35,289
Mm.

2020
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,491
It's... you have artwork, too.

2021
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:39,360
Yeah, it was Reeves' idea.

2022
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:42,129
Uh huh, it's uh,
it's interesting.

2023
01:21:42,131 --> 01:21:46,133
This is the, uh, the angel
covered in, angel of flies.

2024
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:47,368
Lord of the flies.

2025
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,069
Uh huh.

2026
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:52,940
'Cause he's like, brown,
just a, piece of shit, but

2027
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,341
he's covered in flies.

2028
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:57,311
Okay, so, um, can we
sit down for a minute?

2029
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:03,083
Need any avon?

2030
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,185
How's my favorite client.

2031
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,688
W-what are you doing here?

2032
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:11,458
Remember how I knew
a guy who knew a guy?

2033
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,228
Turns out he knows a guy.

2034
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,330
G-15.

2035
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:18,332
It's primo shit.

2036
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:20,267
What's your price?

2037
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:39,720
Surprised to see you here.

2038
01:22:39,722 --> 01:22:41,355
I know how much you
don't like chili.

2039
01:22:41,357 --> 01:22:42,690
Ha! Just kidding.

2040
01:22:42,692 --> 02:45:25,382
It's weed.

2041
01:22:42,692 --> 02:45:25,382
I know that you're
against weed.

2042
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:48,262
Well, you know, I just
want to keep it away from

2043
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:49,430
Brad as long as possible.

2044
01:22:49,432 --> 01:22:51,098
I want to keep
him innocent.

2045
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,733
That's what mom's do.

2046
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:59,473
Um, tomorrow night there
is an old school concert.

2047
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,275
You want to go with me?

2048
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,043
You mean you
and, you and me?

2049
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:03,711
-Yeah.
-Together?

2050
01:23:03,713 --> 01:23:05,245
Yeah.

2051
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:06,747
Uh, yeah. Please.

2052
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:10,517
Does that mean,
uh, you forgive me?

2053
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:11,585
Well...

2054
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:13,187
Baby steps.

2055
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:14,221
You know why?

2056
01:23:14,223 --> 02:46:28,444
Why?

2057
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:17,091
'Cause of what
you did for Brad.

2058
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:18,759
I know you covered up for
him about that weed in his

2059
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:21,595
backpack, and I know that
you've been helping him

2060
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,731
with his schoolwork for
the past few months, and

2061
01:23:23,733 --> 01:23:26,500
he's been doing great.

2062
01:23:26,502 --> 02:46:53,002
Thank you.

2063
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:30,170
I think you can thank
yourself a little bit too.

2064
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,406
It was a selfless act.

2065
01:23:32,408 --> 02:47:04,814
Oh.

2066
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:35,509
-I did a selfless act?
-Yes.

2067
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,444
Yeah, I know, i-i
did that on purpose.

2068
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,714
I'm really good
at being selfless.

2069
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:43,350
Here's another selfless
act I'd like to do.

2070
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,321
No, that was selfish.

2071
01:23:47,323 --> 01:23:48,689
No, it was definitely
not shellfish.

2072
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,057
That was mint.

2073
01:23:50,059 --> 01:23:52,292
Um...

2074
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:54,628
That was not selfish.
You know how I know?

2075
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,363
'Cause it made you smile.

2076
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,166
Come here.

2077
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,340
Want to get out of here?

2078
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:08,108
Uh, yes, please.

2079
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,443
Yes I do.

2080
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,147
Just let me go tell Reeves
that I'm leaving, okay?

2081
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:14,181
Okay.

2082
01:24:14,183 --> 01:24:15,783
Reeves?

2083
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:18,719
No, more, more!

2084
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:20,687
Uh, yeah, right
there! Right there!

2085
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:21,622
Joe?

2086
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:26,060
Reeves?

2087
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:29,329
Don't you stop,
don't you stop!

2088
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,834
Oh yeah.
