1
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,958
Fuck.

2
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,875
ROSENHOLM UPPER SECONDARY SCHOOL

3
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,208
Fuck.

4
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,208
Are you just going to leave?
-I'm in a terrible hurry.

5
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:43,083
That's my bike.
-Okay. Sorry.

6
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,333
Do you need help?
-You don't have to.

7
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,166
I will stick to this.
-Jep. Good.

8
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,041
Excellent.

9
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,791
Yes, well, I'm busy.

10
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:04,500
Do you always get slippery when you tip the bike over?
-Only if no one sees.

11
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:15,333
I thought you weren't coming.
Frida, now the first year begins.

12
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:20,041
Now let's drink and party
and drink and party.

13
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,500
And let's fuck all the third graders.

14
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,500
You slut.
-Thank you.

15
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,916
Here.
-Welcome.

16
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,916
Welcome to. Testing, one, two.

17
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,791
Those are the tutors.

18
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,833
The redhead on the right is Pelle Ratz.
He runs the school's Instagram.

19
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,333
He is involved in everything
with those two next to him.

20
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:13,125
Mathias Kofoed and Emil Hartman.
Pelle has a younger sister Nadja.

21
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,791
Over there. In the velour case.

22
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,958
He's very popular.
So is her friend Amalie.

23
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,250
You have to join them.
-Calm down, Selma.

24
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,666
No. It is important to spin
right from the start with the right guys.

25
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,958
I will not be a wallflower.
-You'll never be a wall rose.

26
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:39,375
Here we go.
Welcome to Rosenholm High School.

27
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:46,083
It's great to see so much
happy and hopeful young faces.

28
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,500
It goes by quickly.

29
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:57,291
Before the tutors have the floor,
I would like to emphasize... This applies to you as well.

30
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:04,416
...that school does not tolerate
bugs of any kind.

31
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,208
It is not allowed,
and will result in expulsion from school.

32
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,416
That's just how boring it is.

33
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,125
Emil, you can continue.
-Thank you.

34
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,750
Testing. Not at all.

35
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:26,250
I'm glad you're listening quietly,
when the headmaster speaks.

36
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:30,625
Surely you're making some noise?

37
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,833
Surely you're making some noise?

38
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,958
Welcome to Rosenholm!

39
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,125
Let's go.
-Me?

40
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,958
Hello.
-Hey.

41
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:16,791
I'm Selma, and this is Frida.
-Hi.

42
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:21,000
Nadja.
-Hey. Amalie.

43
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,750
What category are you in?
-1Q.

44
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:30,208
Kind of nice. We're in the same class.
-Oh yeah, well nice.

45
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,875
It will be fun.

46
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,791
What secondary school did you go to?
-Tofteskolen.

47
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,833
Wouldn't Enemark High School be closer?
-Yes.

48
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:48,416
Yes, but in Rosenholm
has better maths teaching.

49
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
That's Mathias from 3Z.
He's really good looking.

50
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:03,416
He can make me his leather jacket.
He was with Natalia in 2Q.

51
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,291
He wrote there with his tongue Natalia
Natalia's name. Natalia loved it.

52
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,208
I want him too. Now.

53
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:34,083
Our projects include
probability calculus -

54
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:38,958
calculus of proportionality, exponentiation
and symbol manipulation.

55
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:45,125
Can you explain,
what symbol manipulation means?

56
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,958
Nadja.

57
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:53,083
I can't.
Do I look like I know?

58
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:57,041
Could be. What about the others?

59
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,833
Yes?

60
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,708
Doesn't it mean different
rules about -

61
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,666
how the symbols are used
based on certain basic assumptions?

62
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,000
That's right.

63
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,291
Cool.

64
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,916
Hello. Will you come to the audition?

65
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,291
For which audition?
-To audition for the Skylark Festival.

66
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,916
To those where the sons of three
humiliate the girls of number one?

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's going to be a pigsty.
We'll fix them at this address.

68
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:48,916
Parents or teachers must not be told.
This is a secret.

69
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,041
Read the address and burn the note.

70
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:56,833
Let's say hello properly.
Emil Hartman, 3Y.

71
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,833
Frida Frimodt Hansen, 1Q.

72
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,500
Pelle Ratz, 3Y.
-Mathias Kofoed, 3Z.

73
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,750
Hello.
-I need to talk to you.

74
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,666
Like what?

75
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:16,375
When a third grader
greets number one, number one has to say hello.

76
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,250
According to whom?
-Our third graders.

77
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,958
You can do that, can't you?
-I can.

78
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:29,625
When mowing, you have to go all the way down.
-Really deep, that is.

79
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,458
We want to see,
whether you are a submissive.

80
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,750
I can certainly tell you,
as long as you bow to me first.

81
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:48,125
Ahaa. Well, that's all right.
Right, guys?

82
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,333
After you.

83
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,958
Wow.
-Your turn.

84
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,708
No need to imagine.

85
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,791
Tough chick.
-Are you coming to the audition?

86
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,875
Very unlikely.

87
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,791
Here's some tea.

88
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,083
Wonderful, Birgitte.
-Thank you.

89
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:18,208
Did you have a good first day of school?
-Oli. Everyone was really nice.

90
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:23,041
It was really fun,
but we've got a bit to do.

91
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:34,208
The maths task must be returned in two
in two weeks. Can we do it over the weekend?

92
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:39,166
You get the picture,
that high school is a real buffet?

93
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,708
What do you think of Pelle?
-Nadja's big brother?

94
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:47,416
Yes.
He seems to have it under control.

95
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,416
Let's have a look at that maths assignment
this weekend?

96
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll get Pelle.
-You don't have to.

97
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,666
No, but I would love to be a leather cat.

98
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,916
The whole leather thing is really degrading.
-How so?

99
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,875
The boys in number three just want to
hitting on pretty freshmen.

100
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,916
Just as much as I want to hit
a handsome third grader.

101
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,416
Frida, a woman has the right to have a dick.

102
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,416
If you want to get an egg,
you have to find an egg.

103
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,875
For example, from that audition.
-I don't understand why you want to go there.

104
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,166
Don't you have any limits?
-No.

105
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,375
That's why you're coming along.
-Unquote.

106
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,166
Yes, because they're at Pelle's.

107
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,500
They came to see me today.
-Who?

108
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,333
Pelle and others.
-See what?

109
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,041
And you're just now telling us. Let's hear it.
What did they say and do?

110
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:51,083
They asked if I would come
to their stupid audition.

111
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,583
Frida, you're out of your mind.

112
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,416
It's insane.
They've looked you over.

113
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,958
You have to come with us.
-Whatever they're looking at.

114
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,708
Not me.

115
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:14,166
You're coming with us. You don't have to do anything,
if you're afraid of embarrassing yourself.

116
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,041
I'm not afraid of embarrassing myself.
-Then send me along.

117
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:26,125
I'm in the mood for a kebab.
Could either of you pick one up?

118
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,041
It's not true.
You still owe me a cigarette.

119
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,833
Emil?
-I called last time.

120
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:38,833
Don't bother me.
Now look what happened. It's not funny.

121
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,416
Fuck you.

122
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,083
That Frida is quite pretty.
-Really pretty.

123
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,208
What do you think, Emil?

124
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,500
He presents the elusive.
-Just fine.

125
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:58,125
That's what it's like to be cheap.
-I only have one leather coat.

126
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, today?
-Heko heko.

127
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,916
I'll book Frida.
-You can't book them all.

128
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,750
I'll just book Frida then.
-Why would he take care of you?

129
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:12,958
Emil! Look at me now.
Look at this physical miracle.

130
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:17,000
The perfect piece of meat. And a pork butt.
Who could resist this?

131
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:21,125
Me, and I think Frida too.

132
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:27,250
Why don't you believe in Mathias' abilities?
You don't think he can hit on Frida?

133
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,250
Emil.
-Tietty.

134
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,375
Thank you.

135
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,000
Stop that.
-Let's smash the mattress room.

136
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,500
If the girls in three have one,
so do we.

137
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:44,458
It is our turn to be worshipped.
-I have always adored you, my love.

138
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:16,416
I know the weekend is coming.
Tracks 19 - 21 for Monday.

139
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,291
Frida, do you have a moment?
-Yes.

140
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,500
I let some students
make presentations for the lesson.

141
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,916
Could you elaborate on some basic concepts?
-I don't really know...

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,958
That counts as a task, of course.

143
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,250
Okay, but how will it be done?

144
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:43,500
A pair of third-grade maths students
will help you.

145
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,458
Smart students like you will be supported.

146
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,500
What do you say?

147
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,791
Yes, it's fine.
-Nice.

148
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,333
Hi, maths lovers.

149
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,833
Hello.
-I'll help you with the task.

150
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:14,250
We could agree on something more specific.
-Okay. What should we agree on?

151
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,833
Will you come to the audition?
-No.

152
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:22,791
If you come, we can work something out.
-It's a party.

153
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:27,000
You can still talk about statistical
hypotheses and probability calculations.

154
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,375
Let's agree on something right now.
-Now is not the time.

155
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,833
I need to save my bike,
before some psycho knocks it over.

156
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,125
See you tonight?

157
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,833
Okay, I'll be there tonight, but that's all,
to work something out in more detail.

158
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,375
Of course. See you later.

159
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Come on.

160
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,625
I'm glad you left.
-I'll just be here to watch you.

161
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,666
Yeah, right.

162
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,041
What are you doing?
-We have started to smoke.

163
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,791
It shows you that you need to be watched.

164
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Do they live here?
-They live above Dad's restaurant

165
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,166
Aren't you going to try?
-What?

166
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,916
What's wrong with you?
-You're weird.

167
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,291
Frida, I'm glad you came.

168
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:55,250
Welcome to. Hello. Mathias.
-Selma.

169
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,125
Hello. Welcome to.
-Thank you.

170
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:03,375
I am the father of Pelle and Nadja.
Have some rice porridge.

171
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,625
You'll get a little bit of pomp and circumstance.
Then there'll be shots and drinks.

172
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,375
Here.

173
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:17,041
A mouthwash is enough,
so you should eat some porridge.

174
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,791
Have a fun evening.

175
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,666
Take care of everything. I'm out of here.

176
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,208
You're behind.
-We must be careful not to get stuck.

177
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,375
Do you know where the toilet is?
-No.

178
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,166
Hold this.

179
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,916
You'll have to take care of me then.

180
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,166
Moi.
-Hi. You have a nice dad.

181
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,916
Let's go find the remoulade sauce.
-Jep.

182
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,166
Hi, maths lovers.

183
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,458
Glad you could make it.

184
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,125
I thought we had to agree on something.
-Right.

185
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:26,333
Would I come to you one afternoon?
-Okay.

186
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,500
It is then agreed.
Shall we go and celebrate?

187
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:41,750
No thanks. I was going to the bathroom.
-It's down the hall.

188
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:49,083
What is it?
-French 75. It goes in the head.

189
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:53,958
Do you get drunk on skins,
so they'll do what you ask?

190
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,666
Yep.

191
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,500
Okay. Give me one.

192
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,958
Cheers.

193
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,500
Shall we dance too?

194
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,875
It was a joke.

195
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,458
This is perfect.

196
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,708
They know how to make good drinks.

197
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,625
Emil, now I...

198
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,041
At least better than yours.

199
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:50,916
Are they together?
-They are. Didn't you know?

200
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
En.

201
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,125
I think Emil is the real player.
-I guess so.

202
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,166
Hello! Can you hear me?
-Now it starts.

203
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,375
Hello!

204
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,708
Welcome to
to the audition for the skunk festival.

205
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,750
Let's get things moving.
-The girls come on stage one by one.

206
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,958
Let's see how brave you are.
-And hot.

207
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:30,916
And how sexy you are. Cheers!

208
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,250
Cheers!
-Cheers!

209
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,375
Please get down on your knees.

210
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,500
Bring on the remoulade sauce.

211
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:30,375
Come closer.
-I don't like remoulade sauce.

212
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:36,083
Everybody likes it.
-I don't.

213
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,000
Clown, leave it,
if he doesn't like it.

214
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,000
Maybe you just don't have the courage.

215
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,708
I dare,
but I don't like remoulade sauce.

216
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,791
Two at the same time?
The sauce is not enough.

217
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:59,666
Okay, spoilsport. I thought that
let's have some fun, but you're boring.

218
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,083
Okay.

219
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,333
A bit harsh.
Give him a round of applause.

220
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:56,333
Frida! Let's take your picture.
-Why?

221
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,958
It is needed for selection.
-Not now.

222
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:03,041
Yes, Frida?
-Not now, I said.

223
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,208
Frida Frimodt Hansen, 1Q.

224
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:10,708
Thank you.
-You're so fucking pretty.

225
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,375
Are you leaving already?
-Yes.

226
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,166
Why?

227
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,750
It annoys me that someone is taking pictures,
when I've said no.

228
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,333
It was just a flap.
-Ai?

229
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:41,250
Sorry. Sorry,
if you didn't find it funny.

230
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:46,083
May I be excused?

231
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,166
Et.
-Can I walk you home?

232
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:57,291
Et.
-Can I even walk across the road?

233
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,916
Et.

234
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,625
Wait a minute.

235
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,375
Surely you can forgive me?
-Your behaviour is completely ridiculous.

236
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:17,000
We thought you were in on it.
I'd like you to join us.

237
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:21,708
Okay. That's a strange way to show it.

238
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:25,708
I didn't think you were that shallow.
-Do you think I'm shallow?

239
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,916
You're in on that.
-Is that superficial?

240
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,833
I see right through you.

241
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,833
Me no piss.
-Am I trying to fuck you over?

242
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:41,166
Yep. And I really don't want to
you to be my math partner.

243
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,291
What happened?

244
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,750
Leave me alone.
-I guess there's nothing else to do.

245
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:55,833
Then go.
-I'll go.

246
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:59,333
Go to your girlfriend.
-I will.

247
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,041
Why don't you go inside?
-Why don't you go?

248
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,958
I was here first.
-This is a common way.

249
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:09,458
You're really annoying.
-You're really lovely.

250
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,625
Did you have a nice evening?

251
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,708
Yes.
-Frida Frimodt, hello? Did you have fun?

252
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,916
It's nice.

253
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,791
Did you drink a lot?
-A fair amount.

254
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,791
Was it just a party?
-What do you mean?

255
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,250
Did anything exciting happen?
-No.

256
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,416
Okay.

257
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,333
What are you going to do today?
-Go for a run?

258
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,083
Hungover? Do you have to?
-Yes.

259
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,500
Hello.
-Hey.

260
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:01,958
Why did you leave yesterday?

261
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,583
I felt bad about the shots.

262
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,750
Wasn't it the remoulade sauce?
-Something like that.

263
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:16,041
Why did you come on stage?
-How come?

264
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:22,291
Then it was my turn.
-I saw you didn't like it.

265
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:25,708
It was just a game.
-Was it?

266
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:31,666
Yes. I liked it, though.
I would have said it myself, by the way.

267
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,708
You made me look like an idiot.

268
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:38,791
You ruined my moment with Pelle.

269
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:43,666
Excuse me. I just wanted to help.
-You did?

270
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,833
You seemed to enjoy the attention.
-What do you mean by that?

271
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:54,333
Why can't you just admit it?
-Because it wasn't like that.

272
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:57,375
Okay.
-I'm sorry if I spoiled your story.

273
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,875
It's OK.

274
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:08,083
What happened after I left?
-It was a crazy party.

275
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:12,958
Dancing with Pelle.

276
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:19,333
Or we were on the dance floor at the same time.
He was looking at me. Right.

277
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:24,500
Access to the skunk festival
only eight girls.

278
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:35,000
Something has been posted to Rosenholm's account.
-What?

279
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:39,875
Photos of those who make it to the party.

280
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,708
Are you involved?
-No.

281
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:49,625
But you are.
You've already gotten so many likes.

282
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,041
Like what? Show me.

283
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,416
It's true.

284
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,000
Pretty wild, isn't it?

285
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:08,250
What is it? You're quiet.
-Weekend just makes me tired.

286
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,750
Friday was a lot of fun.
-It was.

287
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,666
Frida! Frida.

288
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,833
Frida!

289
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,750
Hello.
-Hey.

290
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,958
You were chosen for the skunk party.
Congratulations.

291
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:34,875
Thank you. And thank you as well.
-You did a great job auditioning.

292
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:38,041
Rispekts.
-Thank you.

293
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:44,791
I have to go to class.
-Me too.

294
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,000
Shall we go one way?
-Yes.

295
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,958
See you later.

296
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,791
Amalie also received an invitation.
-But Selma didn't.

297
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,250
No, but that's the spirit of the game.

298
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:07,166
Will you come to my snails,
Amalie and the other girls?

299
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,416
I don't know yet if I will come at all.
-Come on.

300
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,958
Are you serious?
Do you realize how many people would want your job?

301
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:20,916
Should have red lips, tight skirt
and high heels. I don't have those.

302
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,041
Let's get it then.

303
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,875
It's a bit like being on show.
-Frida...

304
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:33,583
Think of it this way. Guys think,
they can make us do anything.

305
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:37,125
In reality, we have the power.

306
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,125
They are so easy.

307
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:44,000
All they need is a pair of heels and a miniskirt.
Let's take advantage of it.

308
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,875
We run the dogs.
It's going to be a pigsty.

309
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:54,083
Otherwise, you're really gorgeous. Let's go.

310
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:59,083
The comparability calculation has now started,
and you will solve the problem.

311
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:03,625
You can solve the task here
or go to the corridor.

312
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:08,791
What are you doing?
-I'm probably going to the hallway.

313
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:12,666
What about you?
-I'll stay here.

314
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,500
Hello.
-Hey.

315
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,083
Thank you for the last one.

316
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:40,375
You're a good kisser.

317
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,708
Forgive me.
I don't know what got into me.

318
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,166
Shall we forget the whole thing?
-Yes.

319
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:53,041
Thank you.
-Only one candidate.

320
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,416
I do not negotiate with terrorists.
-I do negotiate.

321
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,083
I want to help you with your maths assignment.

322
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:06,833
Okay, but then let's forget it,
what happened on Friday.

323
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,208
Absolutely.
-This is totally professional.

324
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:13,416
Indeed.

325
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:53,291
Hi, honey. According to this young man.
you have a math assignment together.

326
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes, it is.

327
00:35:56,083 --> 00:36:00,291
So go ahead and get started. Nice to meet you.
-Samoi.

328
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:10,375
It was hard to decide whether to bring a pizza
or remoulade sauce.

329
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,875
I chose a pizza.
I hope it's OK.

330
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:18,791
Okay. This is good.

331
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:23,208
You have a beautiful place.
Near the forest.

332
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:29,125
I love the forest.
-Samoi. I often go to the forest.

333
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,666
I run there often.

334
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:37,833
The hill is my favourite place.
-Me too. I almost always run there.

335
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,333
It's really great there.

336
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,041
Should you?
-Yes.

337
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,500
"You have to understand the rules and justify,
why they apply."

338
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:58,583
"You have to think abstractly."

339
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:03,625
You have an insane LP collection.
It's insane.

340
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:08,333
The sound sounds more authentic.
-Same opinion.

341
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:12,500
A really good album.
-It's really good.

342
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:18,833
That was also cool when you sang.
-Learn. Seriously.

343
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,083
What do you think about what I have read?

344
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:26,500
Was it badly worded?
-No. It was good.

345
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,708
Frida...
-Yes?

346
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:46,250
That Friday kiss...
-We were supposed to forget about it.

347
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:52,083
Yes, but I've thought about it a lot.
A lot.

348
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:57,041
Are you too?
-I was really drunk.

349
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,916
That's just what happened.
You're with Nadja.

350
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,666
It's a complicated thing.
-How so?

351
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:10,916
He's more vulnerable than you think.
-Okay.

352
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:19,666
Let's stop talking about it until
everything becomes even more complicated.

353
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,500
Let's call it a day.
-I just...

354
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:29,333
I didn't expect to meet you.
I know I'm dating.

355
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:32,916
But I think about you all the time.
-Learn.

356
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,083
Nadja and I have to get a divorce.
-I don't want to hurt Nadja.

357
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:40,416
I'm the one who insults him.
-Stop this.

358
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,250
I don't want to stop this.
-We don't even have anything.

359
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:49,416
It would be stupid to leave Nadja,
because I don't want you.

360
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,458
Okay. Are you sure?

361
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:02,583
I am. You could leave now.

362
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:08,875
I just want to say,
this is not complicated for me.

363
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:13,750
All that I feel,
when I'm with you is real.

364
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,583
But...
-There's nothing but for me.

365
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,291
But it is, Emil.

366
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:31,791
I don't understand how you can sit there
and I stand here...

367
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:38,375
...and I feel something between us
and you don't.

368
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,958
What do you think?
-Sounds nice.

369
00:39:56,041 --> 00:40:00,875
Would you be interested?
-Yes. Like on Monday.

370
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:03,875
Let's agree then.
-Yes.

371
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:15,083
I can think of something. There's nothing new,
if I say I'm staying over.

372
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:32,416
I'm angry that I didn't say that.
I tried.

373
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:46,250
I'm not going to give up.
See you at the hill in the woods at 18:00.

374
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,125
Frida?

375
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:58,791
I understand. It sucks for you.

376
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:11,250
Okay. What's going on?

377
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,708
Why?
-What's going on with Emil?

378
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:22,125
Nothing. I...
-Don't talk shit.

379
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:26,625
That's what I did. I'm your best friend.
Do you think I'm stupid?

380
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,833
No, but we have nothing.

381
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:36,583
Fuck!
-Are you together?

382
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:39,000
What has happened?

383
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,416
We kissed.

384
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,666
I know it sucks,
but I can't stop.

385
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,625
Think of Nadja.
That has to stop.

386
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:55,083
I think about Nadja all the time, but...
-No buts.

387
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:58,750
You will be blacklisted,
if people find out about this.

388
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,583
You pull me with you.
-You have done nothing.

389
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:07,333
No, but we were rolling together.
And I don't want to fight with Nadja.

390
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:10,708
So could you put an end to it? Right now.

391
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,083
Yes.

392
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,708
Emil asked me to meet him at six...
-You're not going.

393
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:26,375
Of course not.
-Good.

394
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:12,666
I'm going to Selma. Bye.

395
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,583
You came.
-You waited.

396
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:29,500
In our year, I think we have
more girls than others.

397
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,791
Hello.
-Hey.

398
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,750
You said you were going to Selma.
-No, I'm going to Nadja.

399
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:42,791
You said Selma.
-Said Nadja. You just don't get it.

400
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:45,416
I'm going too.

401
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,416
Sorry, I didn't know,
that you had said that.

402
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,916
I didn't know either,
that you were coming.

403
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,458
Where were you?

404
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,708
I just...

405
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,958
Were you with Emil?

406
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,500
Olin.
-Oh, hell, Frida.

407
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,000
Where were you?

408
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,041
In the forest.
-In the forest?

409
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,041
Just now?
-No. He...

410
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:29,375
Were you...?

411
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,375
Yes.

412
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,625
No shit.
-Yes.

413
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:38,875
Bloody hell.
-Yes.

414
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:47,958
Was it fun?
-Fucking great. Really fucking nice.

415
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:51,166
Naughty girl.

416
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,583
I thought you liked boy stuff.
too complicated.

417
00:47:55,666 --> 00:48:02,875
It's bloody complicated.
-I know. I just can't help it.

418
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:08,708
Emil is so sick of...
-Sick of what?

419
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:11,791
Sickly lovely?
-Yes.

420
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:15,875
He knows,
how to make girls think that way.

421
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:20,333
What do you mean?
-Emil is a player.

422
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:25,041
He brags that he has made a guarantee
you're his own leather jacket.

423
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:29,833
No. Emil wouldn't do that.

424
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:33,750
I think he will leave Nadja.

425
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:38,333
Do you really believe?
Have you seen how popular Nadja is?

426
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:44,041
Emil will not leave Nadja
and risks everything.

427
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:48,750
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
-You don't understand what's going on.

428
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:52,833
What is it about?
-Emil is taking advantage of you.

429
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:55,500
And you let them.
-What do you mean?

430
00:48:55,583 --> 00:49:00,666
That's obvious.
A skinner's feast is a competition.

431
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:05,041
You are the prize. Emil just wanted to be
with you before Mathias does.

432
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:10,583
You're drooling over Pelle.
He'd just be using you.

433
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:14,708
I'm sure you will.
The only difference is that Emil is dating.

434
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:20,916
I do it of my own choice.
You are being used.

435
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,041
Emil may well be...
-Be what? Loved you?

436
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,208
Do you know who he's in love with?
Himself.

437
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:36,750
The Frida I know is so smart,
she'd figure it out.

438
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:39,583
Selma I know
would not be so jealous.

439
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:46,083
I am not jealous.
The attention seems to go to your head.

440
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:52,208
Or you just can't stand that all
is happening to me and not to you.

441
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,958
What's wrong with you?

442
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:58,833
Or don't you just not know me anymore?

443
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:02,291
Vai...
-You really don't know me anymore.

444
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:08,291
Let's take a break.

445
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,875
Suitable for.

446
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,791
It was wonderful

447
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:25,083
I think about you all the time...

448
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:34,958
Emil, do you want a beating?

449
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,916
He's lousy
at everything except FIFA.

450
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,625
Emil, your turn.

451
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:46,500
Hello. What's that on your mobile phone?
so interested in?

452
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:49,375
Nothing.
-Come on and play.

453
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:55,333
I smell blood. Come on.
-Yeah yeah. Calm down.

454
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:00,291
Here goes.

455
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:05,416
What a good start.

456
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,375
I miss you

457
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,375
You're a complete shit too.

458
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,833
What is it now?
-What the hell are you doing?

459
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,916
Why?
-with Frida.

460
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,208
Nothing.

461
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:34,166
Were you fooling around behind my little sister's back?
-No.

462
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,500
You are lying. You're texting.
-Did you check my cell phone?

463
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,916
Oh shit.

464
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,000
So you haven't thought about leaving Nadja?
-I don't know.

465
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:51,208
I'm going to stop playing around with Frida,
or whoever it is.

466
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:56,916
I'll make sure you don't screw Nadja.
-I won't, I promise.

467
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,958
Otherwise you're screwing me too.

468
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,833
You are my best friend
and I love you very much.

469
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:06,208
But if you screw Nadja,
I can't be your friend.

470
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:12,375
You know how important Nadja is to me.
She is my little sister.

471
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:18,250
I can't bear to see him betrayed
and I can't guarantee what I'll do if you betray him.

472
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:37,125
It's going to be a great evening.
-Sickly good.

473
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:48,916
You can borrow clothes for a leather party.

474
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,375
Got enough booze for tomorrow?
-Yes, dad will arrange it.

475
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,125
Quite a luxury.

476
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:59,041
Shall we go?
-Yes.

477
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:14,000
Is something wrong?

478
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,916
Can we talk?
What has happened?

479
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:29,625
Nothing special.
There's just no time now.

480
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,166
I don't understand what this is about...?

481
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,166
Are you ready?
-Yes.

482
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:09,041
READ

483
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:18,666
This is good.
-Chilean.

484
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,125
See you later.
-When are you coming home?

485
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,958
I don't know.
-Are you going to town?

486
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,375
I don't know. Could be.

487
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:29,208
Have a nice girls' night out.

488
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,291
Take care of yourself.
-Yes.

489
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,708
Frida, you want a shot?

490
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,416
Yes.

491
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,750
You are absolutely wonderful. Cheers.
-Cheers.

492
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:08,250
I've been watching you for a long time.
I don't know if you've noticed.

493
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:12,041
En.
-Yes, I am.

494
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,500
You're in a class of your own.
-Do you think so?

495
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:20,208
I would like to kiss you.

496
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,666
What?

497
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,708
What is it now?
-Shall we go?

498
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:37,291
I'm quite serious.
You're really pretty. Sorry, I...

499
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,375
You're handsome too.
-Do you think so?

500
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:45,000
Emil and Nadja are gone.
They were so terribly fucked.

501
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:49,041
That's not possible.
It sucks, we have a mattress room.

502
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:53,750
Shall we list it?
-Yes.

503
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,583
Cheers.

504
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,625
This is getting empty.

505
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,500
You and I are going to dance now.
-Yes, ma'am.

506
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,041
YOU'RE GORGEOUS

507
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:09,666
MATHIAS WAS HERE

508
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,333
Damn, how lovely you are.

509
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:22,250
Can you really not march
into my room like that?

510
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,708
Did you have a nice party?
-I want to be alone.

511
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,375
Mom's shoes?
-I borrowed them.

512
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:30,708
They're completely ruined.

513
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:33,583
May I be alone?

514
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:37,375
Is everything OK? Were you drunk?
-Go on.

515
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,833
What is it?
-Can you go? Go on.

516
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:46,125
Okay.
You know where we are if anything comes up.

517
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,500
Close the door.

518
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,500
I've never danced so much.

519
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:54,250
Frida.

520
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:58,708
Hello. Thanks for the last one.

521
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:02,958
Thank you to yourself.

522
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,250
Is everything OK?
-Yes, it is.

523
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:12,916
I'm just busy. See you later.
-I'll see you.

524
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,125
Not eating?
-I'm not hungry.

525
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,083
I've been feeling miserable for a couple of days too.

526
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,625
Do you know why Nadja is not in school?

527
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:43,833
En.
-No word from him since the party.

528
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:46,083
I'm glad you came. Dinner will be here in a minute.
-I'm not hungry.

529
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:50,916
Is something wrong?
-No.

530
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,041
Are you sure?

531
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,250
Yeah, I'm just tired.

532
01:01:56,333 --> 01:02:01,000
Selma has not been seen for a long time.

533
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,500
Are you in a fight?
-I don't know.

534
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:08,375
Let me know if something is wrong.

535
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,875
You can tell us everything.
Everything.

536
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:23,041
I know. It's just a lot of things now.

537
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:57,333
Hello.
-Hey.

538
01:02:57,416 --> 01:03:01,875
I'm sorry for all the things I said.
-It's okay.

539
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:08,125
How are you doing?

540
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:14,041
Did you have a good party?
-You didn't miss anything.

541
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,458
I heard that it was crazy there.

542
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,000
And you were with Mathias, right?

543
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:30,708
En. I mean...
-Or you were.

544
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,916
Okay. What about Emil?

545
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,125
I hardly saw him.

546
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:48,250
I'm sorry for what happened between us.
happened between us. I thought we could...

547
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,166
You're not the one who's lazy.
-What do you mean?

548
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:56,875
First Emil, who is with Nadja.
Then Mathias, whom Amalie has a crush on.

549
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,166
Who's next?

550
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,958
Pelle perhaps?

551
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:08,333
Frida, wait. Excuse me.
-There's no need to apologise.

552
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:13,041
I think that's who you really are.

553
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:16,375
Go find your new best friend Nadja.

554
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,791
No, you can't,
because you stabbed him in the back.

555
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,958
I'm so full of you.

556
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:34,208
Are you ready?
Did something happen at the party?

557
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:38,083
Was there a hiss?
-You'd like to know.

558
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:42,000
What about you?
-No one is pretty enough for me.

559
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,708
What about you and Frida?
-What about us?

560
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:50,166
You were in the mattress room for a long time.
-Yes.

561
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,708
No?
-Yes, we were.

562
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:56,916
Did you just sleep in a spoon?

563
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,416
Maybe you told him an innocent fairy tale.
-No, we did it.

564
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:07,416
Really or just in your imagination?
-No, we did it.

565
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,958
I guess so.
-Yes.

566
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:14,041
Oh, you had sex?
-Yes.

567
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,500
I don't think so.

568
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:30,875
You are unbelievable.
-Frida is a treat.

569
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,750
Indeed.

570
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:42,125
Does he want you,
or is he just playing with your feelings?

571
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:45,625
What are you explaining?
-Will you become a couple?

572
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,583
One thing at a time. Calm down.

573
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:54,041
If you want Frida, do something,
before she moves on to the next one.

574
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:57,166
Good advice. Thank you.

575
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,916
Did you notice that Emil is back?
-I noticed.

576
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,416
Leave him alone.

577
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,333
Okay. Your turn.

578
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,750
I want you to see how wonderful you are.

579
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:35,958
I want you to see how wonderful you are.

580
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,833
Mathias.
-Hey.

581
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:55,791
Did you delete the picture?
-Yes.

582
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,000
Did you show it to anyone?
-No.

583
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:03,500
Why did you take the picture?
-Because I think you're pretty.

584
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:06,041
Remove the image.

585
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,416
Hello.

586
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,750
Hello.

587
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:32,000
Sorry I was so cold
and just left the party.

588
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:35,125
There was just a lot of everything...
-Don't think about me.

589
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:37,916
Don't run away now.

590
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:43,625
Nadja's case is a difficult one.
-I don't want to hear.

591
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:49,416
He has been really sad for his mother
since she died six months ago from cancer.

592
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:54,583
I don't want to cause more grief.
-Of course not.

593
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:58,208
I've been all over the place.

594
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:07,000
When I saw how you and Mathias
flirting at the party...

595
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:12,833
I got really jealous.
That's when I knew I had to.

596
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:15,958
Forced to what?

597
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,500
Leave it to Nadja.

598
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:27,833
But I didn't tell you,
that I have a crush on someone else.

599
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:30,000
Are you?

600
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:37,791
Okay. Who do you have a crush on?

601
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:42,500
Frida fucking Frimodt Hansen.
I'm crazy about you.

602
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,958
Emil, I'm crazy about you too.

603
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:03,625
I know we can't because of Nadja.
to be together right now.

604
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:07,500
But I hope so,
that at some point we can.

605
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:09,958
Yes.

606
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:32,208
Hello.

607
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:36,583
Are you all right, Nadja?
-Emil went ballistic on Friday.

608
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:39,791
I'm really sorry to hear that.

609
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:44,833
Life sucks.
-I'm going to get some food.

610
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:48,000
Will you be OK?
-Of course.

611
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:56,875
I asked Emil if he was in love
with someone else.

612
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,291
Okay.

613
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:05,250
Do you know something?
-Me?

614
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:08,958
I have suspected that
Frida and Emil have something going on.

615
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:16,416
I don't know anything about it.
Frida and I don't talk anymore.

616
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,750
You know something.

617
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,416
And I don't know.
-Selma...

618
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,041
Help me, please.

619
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:31,416
I think they have communicated.

620
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,833
You think?
-Yes.

621
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:37,500
Has Frida shown you any messages?

622
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:44,583
We need access to
his messages.

623
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:49,208
You probably know Frida's password.
-I know, but we can't do that.

624
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,125
Frida doesn't notice.

625
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,250
No.

626
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:59,000
If you help me,
I can help you.

627
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:02,250
In relation to what?
-Bell.

628
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:09,458
The clown?
-Yes. It's pretty obvious.

629
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:15,291
What do you mean?
-That you like him.

630
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:24,291
Pelle said to me,
he thinks you're really pretty.

631
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:28,041
No. Really?

632
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,750
Let's use my mobile phone.

633
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,916
Here.

634
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,625
I knew it. They're together.

635
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:01,458
With whom else
Frida has written?

636
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,291
Mathiaksen.

637
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,208
Like what?

638
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:18,208
Give it to me.

639
01:12:51,916 --> 01:12:55,916
Hello. Bun, please.

640
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:06,333
FUCKGIRL OF THE YEAR!

641
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:57,833
Yes.

642
01:13:57,916 --> 01:14:01,583
I thought you were with Nadja.

643
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:06,416
That you went home together.
That all you wanted from me was sex.

644
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,708
Do you think that's what I am?

645
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:21,000
I thought you were different too.

646
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,083
Emil.

647
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,708
Hello.

648
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:20,791
Selma, I'm having a party tonight. You can come, can't you?
-I need to talk to you.

649
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:33,375
What is this all about? The picture...
-Yes. It's ridiculous.

650
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:37,500
What were you thinking?
-I didn't do it.

651
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:42,250
You took a picture of Frida's profile.
-I haven't done anything.

652
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:45,875
Mathias also has the picture,
Maybe he shared it with someone.

653
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:49,083
Pelle will manage the account.
I'm sure you know the password.

654
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:55,833
Selma. Many people know the password.
Anyone could have done it.

655
01:15:57,916 --> 01:16:03,041
Remove the image.
-I have nothing to do with the picture.

656
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,458
Okay?

657
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:22,666
Okay. Can you write the name of the author?

658
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,833
Nadja, wait a minute.
-What now?

659
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:36,083
I want to talk to you.

660
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:44,291
I understand that there are
a revealing picture of a student.

661
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:47,833
Have you heard of it or seen it?

662
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:52,750
They all are.
-Right.

663
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:57,166
It is illegal to share
sexual or explicit images.

664
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,375
What does it have to do with me?

665
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:05,041
Suppose you had something
to do with the publication of the photo -

666
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:08,583
you must remove it immediately.

667
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:12,083
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't care.

668
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:17,083
I don't think so.
I don't think you care at all.

669
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:23,000
I think you posted a picture,
because you're upset.

670
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:27,666
Shall we have a chat?

671
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:32,958
Sweetheart. Come here.

672
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:36,500
About.

673
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:46,625
Mathias?
-You shouldn't come here now.

674
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:50,333
I know I'm not welcome.
-I'd like to kick your ass.

675
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:54,041
I want to talk to Mathias.

676
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:57,750
What have you gone to do?
-I didn't publish the picture.

677
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:01,375
Anyone can have a password.
-Delete photo.

678
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:03,083
I have done nothing.

679
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:08,208
Just the fact that you took the picture,
tells me what a jerk you are.

680
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:10,291
You should have taken a picture yourself.

681
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:16,000
What are you freaking out about?
-What the hell are you freaking out about?

682
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:22,750
All this shit is your fault.
-Our fault? It's your fault.

683
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:26,875
You could have said it directly,
that you have a crush on Frida.

684
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:32,083
Games with Pelle, Nadja and me
my feelings. Fuck you, Emil.

685
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:35,166
I did not publish the picture.
What do you think of me?

686
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:27,458
Thank you.

687
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:16,375
Hello.
-Hey.

688
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:23,791
I'm really sorry,
that I took that picture.

689
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:30,583
I deleted it when you told me to.
I didn't publish it.

690
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:37,625
If you need anything, a friend, for example,
I'm here.

691
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:41,916
Thank you.
-I just want to say that...

692
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:45,791
I think you are absolutely wonderful.

693
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:49,791
If I had known that you and Emil
were in love, I wouldn't have...

694
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,666
Emil is not in love with me.

695
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,291
Yes, it is. Frida.

696
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:59,416
He really is.

697
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:13,958
I have to say one thing.

698
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:23,125
I know very well,
it's all very complicated now.

699
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:30,375
But it was all because of that,
I'm really into you.

700
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:41,291
I had a crush on you too.
-But?

701
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:49,208
What else? Was that it?

702
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:56,250
Does it all make no difference now?
-No, but everything is ruined.

703
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:03,125
Everything is in pieces.
Before there was no but now there is.

704
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,875
Hello.

705
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,833
Isn't he in the picture?
-Yes.

706
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:05,083
Nadja published the picture.

707
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:08,708
What? Are you sure?

708
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,208
I am.

709
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:20,625
We visited your Instagram account
to read your posts.

710
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,250
Why?

711
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:34,458
Nadja got me into it.
I had no idea there would be that picture.

712
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:42,458
I understand if you don't want to talk anymore
to me, but I really regret what I did.

713
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:46,833
I don't understand how you could do that.

714
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:51,833
I understand very well,
if you can't forgive.

715
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:54,791
It's difficult, though.

716
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,375
But...

717
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:06,291
But?

718
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:12,791
I've done all kinds of shit myself.
So...

719
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:19,083
Maybe one day.
-But one day.

720
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:28,291
Okay, see you in the morning.

721
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:35,250
I'm here for the last day.

722
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:40,500
After the autumn break, I'm changing high schools.

723
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:43,208
Switching?
-Yes.

724
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,791
Frida,
I'm really sorry about everything.

725
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:02,916
So do I.
-Excuse me.

726
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,208
See you later.
-I'll see you.

727
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:19,000
Hello.

728
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:24,500
Hello.

729
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,666
Are you still seeing each other?

730
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,958
No, that's the end.
-All of it?

731
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:36,875
Completely.
-If so, I can forgive you.

732
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:40,791
Are you serious?
-I've missed you.

733
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,375
Likewise.

734
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:48,041
Shall we play?

735
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:51,583
Will you come tonight?
-Tietty.

736
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:57,083
No way!

737
01:25:57,166 --> 01:25:59,875
Hi, Jette.
-Hi, Frida.

738
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:06,416
Is the task already completed?
-No.

739
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,750
I just came to say that it's not going to be finished.

740
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:18,125
After the autumn break, I'm changing high schools,
so there's no point in doing an assignment.

741
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:21,833
Thank you for everything, though.
-Frida, come here.

742
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:35,625
Now it feels difficult,
but don't forget how amazing you are.

743
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:39,166
Internalize the fact that you are gorgeous.

744
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,958
I don't feel very great.
-You are, though.

745
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:51,750
If someone makes a mistake about your relationship,
show them who you really are.

746
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:54,625
It's no more complicated than that.

747
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:57,708
It's just maths.

748
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:15,250
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I borrow your mike?

749
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:20,500
Now?
-He's had enough attention already.

750
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:23,875
I will be brief.
-All right.

751
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:26,041
Thank you.

752
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,291
Hello.

753
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:48,458
Most of you probably know me from years ago
the year girl, but my name is Frida.

754
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:55,041
I know,
that I have hurt some of you.

755
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:59,500
I know I've made a mess of things.

756
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:03,041
I'm really sorry about that.

757
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:10,500
But is it fair to label me
as fuck girl of the year just because...

758
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:15,416
that I was with a boy,
who took a picture of me...

759
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:19,375
that you decided to share?
I don't think it is.

760
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,791
But you're a real fuck girl.

761
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:31,958
Yes.

762
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:36,250
Some things really are real, Pelle.

763
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:39,625
That's what one of you has taught me.

764
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:46,625
When we are together,
there's something real.

765
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:51,750
I can still feel it,
even though I'm standing here alone.

766
01:29:54,166 --> 01:30:00,958
I am happy,
that I got to experience something so real.

767
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:04,041
That's hard to find.

768
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:11,041
That's all I have. Thank you.

769
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:22,500
It's not real.
-Who does he think he is?

770
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:28,625
I'm a real fuck girl too.

771
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,208
So do I.

772
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,458
Likewise.

773
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,708
I'm a fuck girl too.

774
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:08,791
Silence, please.

775
01:31:08,875 --> 01:31:10,666
Thank you.

776
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:20,041
I want to stress that in this school
no one is called names like that.

777
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:32,833
Academic year for all year groups
has got off to a good start.

778
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:40,166
I want to tell you,
what happens after the autumn holidays.

779
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:04,458
Frida!

780
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:09,875
Excuse me.
