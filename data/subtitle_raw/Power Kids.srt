1
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,029
Retreat! Quickly!

2
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,349
Retreat! Quickly!

3
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,952
Good.

4
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,758
Turn around! Turn around!

5
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,080
Turn right!

6
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,149
Perfect! Perfect!

7
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,831
Okay.

8
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,998
Good. Do it again, again, and again.

9
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,235
A weak kick like this?
Is this Thai boxing?

10
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,560
Do a strong kick. Do a strong kick.
Use your waist and your body.

11
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,117
Master.

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,840
Again. Again.
Strong kick. Strong kick.

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,238
Master.

14
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,836
A weak kick like this?
Is this Thai boxing?

15
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,600
Strong kick!

16
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:41,952
Master.

17
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,876
Master.

18
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,316
Strong kick!

19
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,320
Master.

20
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,470
What the hell is it?

21
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,072
My dad sent me a thousand baht.
You only gave me five hundred baht.

22
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,918
You will spend it all.
Just take five hundred for now.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,716
Yes sir.

24
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:04,953
Wow!

25
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,593
It's my dad.
You think he's handsome?

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,914
My dad worked with Michael Jackson.
He dances the same.

27
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,756
Let me look.

28
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,119
I will tell you one thing.
Your mum never had a affair for sure.

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,999
Look! He looks like his dad.

30
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,116
The square face is very popular right now.

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,033
You don't understand?

32
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,000
Your dad's not just a famous country singer.
He's also a famous joker.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,199
He takes all the showbiz jobs
so others have none.

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,559
Did you know he was going to send
you to study in another country.

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,795
But still you come to be with me.

36
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,199
You say it like you make fun of me.

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,116
Was that fun?

38
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,229
Damn you! That hurt!

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,876
Wow! Is this your car Jib?
It's pretty.

40
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,757
It's the latest one.

41
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,391
This car has a camera too.
Clear picture and shockproof.

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,200
Oh! This one! Cat. Look at this one!
This is the one I want. This one.

43
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,758
Let me look.

44
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,158
Is it powerful?
Jib, can I play with it?

45
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,149
Sure. This car is the best.
I just modified it to go a bit quicker.

46
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,674
lf you boxed as well as you talk,
you'd be a Junior Champion.

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,999
Phong! Get with the times!

48
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,272
Look at Jib's car! Isn't it cool!

49
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,634
Do you like this one?

50
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,793
No, I like the other one.
Don't you remember?

51
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,239
Yes, I remember.

52
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,749
Cat, I want one of those.
Can you buy one for me?

53
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,148
I want this one.

54
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,600
This one? It's twenty baht.

55
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,033
Can you sell it for ten baht?

56
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,592
- I can't. I would lose money.
- Can you get a different one, Wun?

57
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,669
Okay.

58
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
Do you have a cheaper one?

59
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,557
Yes. This one is fifteen baht.

60
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,908
Can you sell it for eight baht?

61
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,750
Take this one then. It's five baht.

62
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,838
What is this?

63
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,793
It is a ''damn shit''.

64
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
Tsk.

65
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,995
Damn you.

66
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,910
It's locked.

67
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,954
Come this way.

68
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,116
Where's my ladder?

69
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,311
Where's it gone?
I only used it yesterday.

70
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,072
lf I find out who took my ladder,
I will kill them.

71
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,190
It was me.

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,035
- Master.
- Master.

73
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,117
Uncle.

74
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,830
Richard!

75
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,836
Good work!

76
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,309
Beer in the morning!

77
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,991
- My friend.
- Okay, okay, okay.

78
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,950
Drink coffee?

79
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,480
- You!
- Cat! Cat! It doesn't matter.

80
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,310
- Uncle!
- Okay, okay.

81
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,760
- Hey!
- Hey, Cat!

82
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,796
Were you scared yesterday?

83
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,472
Okay, okay. Sorry.

84
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,637
What are you looking at runt?
Get out of the way!

85
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,195
Go, go, go!

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,717
Master.

87
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,120
Master, yesterday l...

88
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,910
They said I couldn't,
but I wanted to.

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,037
I want to go outside sometimes.

90
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,751
I'm telling you.
lf I hit you like I hit them...

91
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,513
...you will die.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,319
Why are you crying?

93
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,189
What were you doing?
You know he has a heart problem.

94
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,310
Do you want to see him die
before me?

95
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,635
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,756
Save it and say it to your parents'
spirits at the temple.

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,030
Sorry.

98
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,710
Hey, Wun! can you just stay still?

99
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,156
I have both good news and bad news.

100
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,148
Tell us everything.
What will happen will happen.

101
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,996
Wun's cardiovascular system
is now very weak.

102
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,549
His heart rate is less than
30% of the normal rate.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,552
lf it drops more,
it will be very dangerous.

104
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,314
We must monitor him closely.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,190
He must take stimulants and
diuretics to improve his lung efficiency.

106
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,753
This must continue until
he has his operation.

107
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,276
Relax.
We do have some better news.

108
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,040
Siam lnter Hospital in Ratburee

109
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,353
tell me they have a
twelve year old patient.

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,760
He has a head injury who has
been in a coma for many months.

111
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,160
The doctors have just confirmed
he is brain dead.

112
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,951
His blood group and the size of
his heart are suitable for Wun

113
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,075
Now we wait for his parents' decision.

114
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,949
It does seem to be good news,

115
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,351
though really it is bad news.

116
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,955
Because...

117
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,713
Still a child loses their life.

118
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,517
You going to stare at it until a car
comes out from the book?

119
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,749
Phong. Can I borrow the money
that your dad sent?

120
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,991
Do you want it?
It's a lot of money.

121
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,513
I'll give it all to you.

122
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,917
What? You only have about
a hundred baht.

123
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,600
Oh! I pay for stuff sometimes.
What about your savings?

124
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,113
Still not up to two hundred.

125
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,028
Will it be enough?

126
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,117
Don't worry.
I will ask for money from the master.

127
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,593
Are you stealing uncle's money?

128
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
I want to take money to give to Wut.

129
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,440
He wants to buy a present for Wun.

130
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,750
I'm only taking one hundred,
and it's my money too.

131
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,718
One hundred is not enough.

132
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,399
Did you really get money from the master?

133
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,955
Sorry.

134
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,869
Who is master Lek?
I want to learn Thai boxing

135
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,833
- I'm a tourist, I don't know.
- Right.

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,399
Hey, Excuse me.

137
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,957
Excuse me. Where is master Lek?
I've come to learn Thai boxing.

138
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,950
To wear a band on my head
and do like this.

139
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,513
Can you speak English?

140
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,837
Yes. I want to learn Thai boxing
with Kroo Lek.

141
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,553
Can you speak Thai?

142
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,195
Where is master Lek?
I want to learn Thai boxing.

143
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,272
I know a way to get more money.

144
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,714
Hum... This is my friend.
He will teach you about Thai boxing and...

145
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,797
Go, go! Kick, kick, kick, kick!

146
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,750
He will kick.

147
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,433
Quickly.

148
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,398
Cool!

149
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,552
Kick, kick, kick.

150
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,311
Again, again.

151
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,199
- Again, again, again
- Okay, okay, okay.

152
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,637
Powerful! Powerful!

153
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,268
Sorry!

154
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,040
Don't butt with him.

155
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,031
Look out little missy.
Out of the way runts.

156
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,791
Hey! Hey!

157
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,359
Fuck you!

158
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,751
Thai boxing.

159
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
Wut. Remember uncle said:

160
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,228
Don't pick on someone bigger than you.

161
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,998
You little son of a...

162
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,951
Wut! Help me!

163
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,991
Oh shit!

164
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,358
He's coming! He's coming!

165
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,876
Okay, Phong.

166
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,879
Muay Thai!

167
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,909
Cool!

168
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,036
Go!

169
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,672
Do I teach you boxing to hurt people?

170
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,880
It's for...for harmony.
It's for protecting yourself.

171
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,080
Not to hurt people.

172
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,956
Go!

173
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,635
Are you good?

174
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,230
Will you use Thai boxing to
rob and kill people one day?

175
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,517
Do I teach you to behave like this?

176
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,755
No! Be still! Be good!

177
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,996
Today I will hit all of you.

178
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,832
What are you doing here?

179
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,114
Go home!

180
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,668
Go home!

181
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,392
Master Lek! Master Lek!

182
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,996
You're bad friends.
You don't take the beating.

183
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,877
And let me be the only
one who is hurt.

184
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,280
Because you are stupid.

185
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,033
Wun. You're making fun of me?

186
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,029
He's only young. He's only young.

187
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,870
- Master. Phong is teasing me.
- No, no! What? No,no!

188
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,554
Hey! Who's teasing him again?

189
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,349
You know he is sick.

190
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,037
You only just make trouble,
and now you do it again.

191
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,229
And Wun has a heart problem.

192
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,951
How can you scare him?

193
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,880
I must punish you. I will hit your butt
to get you to remember it.

194
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,677
- Sir. I'm so wrong.
- Are you wrong?

195
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,233
Yes. I'm wrong. So very wrong.

196
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,319
I will hit your butt, but maybe your butt
already hurts. I will hit your leg instead.

197
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,039
Oh! No,no!

198
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,955
Remember do not scare him.

199
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,997
- Do not scare him.
- No, no.

200
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,949
Two thousand five hundred baht.

201
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,638
Oh! Too fucking expensive.
Are you cheating us?

202
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,429
- You little fucking dog-mouth!
- Don't listen to him, sir.
Can you give a discount?

203
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,437
Two thousand two hundred baht.
Any cheaper and it would be free.

204
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,320
You know this car has very few extras.

205
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,114
Can you give more discount please?

206
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,589
No. Enough!

207
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,720
You again, damn it, Phong.

208
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,314
It happens every time and it happened again.

209
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,039
What can we do?

210
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,272
We only have one thousand six hundred baht.

211
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,120
I don't know either.

212
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,348
Can you just think?

213
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,389
At times like these your
damn brain doesn't work.

214
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,075
Wut. Here's the car that Wun wanted.

215
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,309
Oh! Jib my dear friend! You are like
an angel who makes everything good.

216
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,675
Hey! Damn Phong!
We are sharing the cost.

217
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,916
Oh! You are not cool!

218
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,789
Thank you Jib.

219
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,393
Hey, Jib. Now you are friends
with the temple boxers?

220
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,711
No! I just meet them by chance.

221
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,320
Being with them will drag you down.

222
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,039
You need to go to the temple and
wash the bad luck out from your life.

223
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,789
Why did you say a stupid thing like that?

224
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,593
Why? You got a problem?

225
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,956
Jack. Do we have a race tomorrow?

226
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,954
Yes. There is one tomorrow,

227
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,753
You can bring your car to join in too.

228
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,994
Wut, Phong. Go home.

229
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,396
Don't follow us. Two-faced bitch.

230
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,869
You coming with us?
I don't like to wait.

231
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,672
I'm going now.

232
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,111
Is this your new car?

233
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,198
The same as the one I want.

234
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,753
Can I play?

235
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,951
You don't need to ask me, it's yours.

236
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,952
Happy birthday Wun.

237
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,028
My car.

238
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,353
My car.

239
00:22:53,560 --> 00:23:07,679
#Happy birthday to you...#

240
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,156
Where's my money gone?

241
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,995
Hey! Hey!

242
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,430
Ho! You're good! Like a professional.

243
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,799
Really! Good enough for other
people to see?

244
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,711
Oh! You're ready to race!

245
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,550
Really!

246
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,314
Take it, take it. Come, come.

247
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,150
Thank you.

248
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,949
- You don't need to thank me. It's Wun's.
- lf it belongs to Wun,
it's the same as if it's mine.

249
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,757
It's not the same.

250
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,877
How dare you say that, Phong?

251
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,160
Happy birthday Wun. Happy birthday.

252
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,312
After you finish don't
go to bed too late. Okay?

253
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,030
Tomorrow you can take Wun to meet
your gang leader at the race course.

254
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,950
Not a good idea.
Don't get involved with them.

255
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,513
Do they have car racing tomorrow Jib?
Can I go with you?

256
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,910
Don't go! Wun. Trust me.

257
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,954
Otherwise you will get sick again.

258
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,998
But I really want to go.

259
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,795
Master has told me I must go
to stay at the hospital soon.

260
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,474
I don't know when I will be back.

261
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:45,150
Wut. Please let me go. Please,
Wut?

262
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,113
Please let me go. Please Wut?

263
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,030
Wait and see. I will get
first place for you all.

264
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,713
You're boasting!

265
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,879
What time does the racing start?

266
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,030
What racing?

267
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
The car racing.

268
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Who's racing?

269
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,200
Me.

270
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,714
Oh! Little boy! You're
gonna be in the race.

271
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,275
Where is your car?
Let me look.

272
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,798
You will see.

273
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,155
You think my racecourse is for fools?

274
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,872
I already told you not to come.

275
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,877
He just want to try to
race on a real course.

276
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,918
You didn't need to say a thing like that.

277
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,830
Yes. You didn't. And I've
modified this car for him.

278
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,637
You have?

279
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,357
Wun. Today can you just watch?

280
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,560
Oh! Cat! We left the master
to come here today.

281
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,269
Let me enter the competition.
Please Cat? Wut, please?

282
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,440
Hey! Take him away.
He's a fucking pest. So annoying.

283
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,395
Hey! Don't.

284
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,034
lf he want to race,
then let him race.

285
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,749
I will arrange it.

286
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,435
Don't let your tears
drop on my racecourse.

287
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,469
I feel a thrill of excitement!
I'm going to buy a drink.

288
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,075
Wun! Go Wun!

289
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,076
Quick Wun! Quick!

290
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,036
My car!

291
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,996
Hey! Wun!

292
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,074
Wun! Don't go in there Wun!

293
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,116
My car!

294
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,589
You die!

295
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,636
Wun!

296
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,837
Wun!

297
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,629
Hey! Follow them! Quickly!

298
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,636
You!

299
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,434
Wun! Get out! Get out!

300
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,352
Let him go please!

301
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,995
Keep your nose out of it.

302
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,117
You!

303
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,675
I have to be the hero again.

304
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,079
Quickly! Quickly!

305
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,237
Wun!

306
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,115
Go quickly!

307
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,757
Wun! Wun! Wun!

308
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,277
You cannot come in here.

309
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,999
Master. I could not get there in time.

310
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,392
Then he ran away.

311
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,598
Suddenly he fell down.

312
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,638
I could not help him master.

313
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,073
I have good news.

314
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,555
At ten o'clock today, US ambassador
Mr. Peter Ana arrives for a check-up.

315
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,310
Good morning your excellency.

316
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,440
- Welcome here.
- Thank you.

317
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,480
This is our medical team.

318
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,754
Hello. How are you

319
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,679
- Hello. How are you.
- Thank you.

320
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,439
- Please come with us
- Thank you

321
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,992
I saw just now that you had
trouble walking up the stairs.

322
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,039
Quick! Get out quickly!

323
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,637
Go!

324
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,669
On behalf of the Tealaw people.

325
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,632
The minority who try to get compassion.

326
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Who try to get territory from Thailand.

327
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,156
But never get any attention
from the Thai government.

328
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,950
Today it is time to make the
whole world look at us.

329
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,196
As we speak, a terrorist attack
has occurred in Thailand.

330
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,600
As yet, none of the renowned terrorist groups
has claimed responsibility for this act.

331
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,160
...now no group has taken responsibility....

332
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,360
...for now the request from terrorists...

333
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,990
...lately we get a report that terrorists...

334
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,000
Ha! Come on.

335
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,797
- What you're not sure.
- No. Try again.

336
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,674
No, again.

337
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,955
Don't cheat me.

338
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,988
- Damn Phong! Don't cheat.
- Okay.

339
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,149
- I just hit you softly.
- Why?

340
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,993
- Again.
- Again.

341
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,799
Hey! Hey! Loud noises.
Not in the hospital.

342
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,270
Don't you listen?

343
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,159
Haven't you heard the news yet?

344
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,350
What news doctor?

345
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,240
The terrorists have attacked
Siam lnter Hospital and taken

346
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,240
the US ambassador Mr Peter Ana
and everyone inside as hostages.

347
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,520
All five hundred people in the hospital...

348
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,397
Uncle, this is....

349
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,508
What about the heart they're
transferring to here?

350
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,150
I've sent my staff to
coordinate with them.

351
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,635
The most important thing is time.

352
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,032
Because the heart has been
taken out from the body already.

353
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,991
And the heart can only be out
from a body for four hours.

354
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,920
Four hours.

355
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,993
I'm not sure how long they
will parley with the terrorists.

356
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,600
...now the police have closed all
routes to Siam lnter Hospital,

357
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,080
but there is no progress as the terrorists
still refuse to communicate.

358
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,949
We will continue to report on
these events as they happen...

359
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,914
- Wut wait!
- Wut.

360
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,150
Phong what happened? I will take...

361
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,108
What?

362
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,680
I can take....

363
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,193
This is all your fault!

364
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,958
Wut! I'm going too. Wut!

365
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,232
Can you drive quicker?
This is as slow as a tortoise.

366
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,594
lf you didn't have me, how would
you get to Ratburee?

367
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,954
Hurry up Ood! Get a move on!

368
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,040
This car is old.
It can only go this fast.

369
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,235
You argue with me?
Now you dare to argue?

370
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,956
Sir. They want a reporter.

371
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,200
No. Don't follow us.

372
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,838
You're no use to us now.

373
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,430
Excuse me...excuse me...

374
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,029
There's a lot of people.
We can't get in. Believe me.

375
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,151
Huh! Where are you going?

376
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,389
Just coming through.
Nothing to worry about.

377
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,071
On behalf of the Tealaw Army, we want
our human rights and equality

378
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:46,637
With no tribes, no racism
and no discrimination.

379
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,674
We want equity.

380
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,836
Enough!

381
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,070
Take them out!

382
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,359
Go! Get out! Go!

383
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,035
Quick! Get out!

384
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,996
Go! Go! Go!

385
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,959
What we gonna do?
We have less than four hours.

386
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,715
Believe me.
I watch a lot of Hollywood films.

387
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,952
Everytime they get in a sewer, they
end up where they need to.

388
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,559
It's damn dirty.

389
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,989
Smells dirty too.

390
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,792
Phong! Take it off!

391
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,069
Which way?

392
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,995
l think this way.

393
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,120
You don't believe me!

394
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,792
I'm the one who got us into here.

395
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,557
Why did you come this way?
It smells bad.

396
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,229
We shouldn't go this way.
It stinks.

397
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,036
I think this way.

398
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,918
Oh! You never fucking believe me!

399
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,550
Walk quickly!

400
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,038
Go!

401
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,278
Quick!

402
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,840
Go quick!

403
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,431
Go!

404
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,990
My cigar's finished.

405
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,672
How's that?

406
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:03,993
Okay.

407
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,232
I can't. I can't.
I'm allergic to tobacco.

408
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,713
I'm out of here!

409
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,279
Where are you? Damn boy.

410
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,591
You look in that room.

411
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,388
I'll look in this room.

412
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,269
He won't escape.

413
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,433
Phong. Go quick!

414
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,115
Phong. Quick!

415
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,031
Phong. Take the rope.

416
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,277
Cat! Why didn't you ask me
before if I wanted to do this?

417
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,349
Hey! Wait!

418
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,194
They're not here!

419
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,916
Hey! Stop!

420
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,238
He's getting close to me.

421
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,679
Shut the fuck up.

422
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,632
Jib. How did you get in here?

423
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,150
- I go first.
- Wait for me!

424
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,952
Bad luck has come to me now.

425
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,439
Be quiet, damn Phong.

426
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,239
How can I be quiet? You look.

427
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,030
Where are you going?

428
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,396
Don't come.

429
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,559
Death is the best thing of life.

430
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,309
I wish only one thing...

431
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,956
that I am the last person who dies here.

432
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,591
No!

433
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,914
I'm not a terrorist.

434
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,274
Where are you going?

435
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,512
Don't go out there.
They are really dangerous.

436
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,271
I know the way out.

437
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,239
I will take you out of here.

438
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,959
I have friends with me too.

439
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,880
You wait here.

440
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,348
I will be back, I promise.

441
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,510
Excuse me.

442
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,276
Where is the doctor
responsible for Mawin?

443
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,272
- I will check for you.
- He's been gone for long time. Can you call?

444
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,988
Now we have an interesting video
from a member of the public.

445
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,599
The video seems to show some of
the hostages trying to escape.

446
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,120
How you let this happen?

447
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,509
...we will try to report the progress
as soon as we can...

448
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,472
They're little kids and you cannot stop them?

449
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,354
Go catch them!

450
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,668
Catch them alive.

451
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,312
What?

452
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,632
I don't want to make more
trouble with anybody.

453
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,869
We just want what we are due.

454
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,836
It's better to just follow my order.

455
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,917
Do what I said.

456
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,956
What? Too fucking scared?

457
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,110
Enough, enough. Don't do any more.

458
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,395
The kids won't be in here. Let's go.

459
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,836
I go now.

460
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,112
Ghosts! Ghosts!

461
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,153
Cat! Here!

462
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,840
Don't worry. Believe me.
I'm here. Don't be scared.

463
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,637
- Let's go quick.
- I don't believe this is a real man!

464
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,914
You're still scared of me?

465
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,075
What are you complaining about?

466
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,680
Doctor. Doctor.
Wake up, doctor.

467
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,829
Hey. You don't need to.

468
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,359
I can do it myself.

469
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,309
What are you doing?

470
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,275
Doctor. I'm sorry.

471
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,519
I'm sorry doctor.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm really sorry.

472
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,680
You didn't mean to hurt him,
but you put your feet in his face?

473
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,159
Look! Your footprint!

474
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,599
Can you find where they keep the heart?

475
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,989
Where is it?

476
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,600
- Are you sure it's this way?
- Sure.

477
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,229
There's only one walkway in this hospital.
How can I get it wrong.

478
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,039
Are you just guessing?

479
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,111
Organ Donation Center!
Quickly! Quickly!

480
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,791
Where is it? The room is full of boxes.

481
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,388
Yes. Full of boxes.

482
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,999
What's that? Can you turn back?

483
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,914
It's upside down. I can't read it.

484
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,878
Come here. I can do it.

485
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,630
Oh! You're damn stupid.

486
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,160
This is Wun's name.
It must be the heart for Wun.

487
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,990
Are you sure?

488
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,999
It's at the door.

489
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,111
Hey! Stop!

490
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,996
Go now!

491
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,469
Quick!

492
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,116
Don't move!

493
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,955
Catch them, quick!

494
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,400
Jib! Help me! Help me!

495
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,833
Phong! Take the rope!

496
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,035
I'm gonna pull now.

497
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,680
How are you Phong?

498
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,752
Are you trying to kill me?
I'm going to die!

499
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,075
Hey! I survived!

500
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,000
Phong hold it tight.

501
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,638
Why Jib?

502
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,319
That hurt! Damn it, Jib!

503
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,593
I should either thank you or curse you,
huh?!

504
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,231
Ouch.

505
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,275
I think better to thank you.

506
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:49,990
Take a picture quickly!

507
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,954
Go! Go!

508
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,600
I'm in front of the room
of Mawin Boonrubsrab

509
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,720
younger brother of
Nattawut Boonrubsrab

510
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,840
the boy who is in the Siam lnter
Hospital in Ratburee.

511
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,958
He has something to say to
his brave, bold brother.

512
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,235
Wut.

513
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,877
I know you are the
best in the world.

514
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,877
But I want you to come back.

515
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,073
I don't want the heart.

516
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:16,911
lf I don't have you,
I don't want anything.

517
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,272
I don't want anything.

518
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,279
Wut please come back.

519
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,434
I don't want the heart.

520
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:39,595
lf I don't have you,
I don't want anything.

521
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,993
I don't want anything.

522
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,080
So now we know who they are

523
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,039
and why they needed to
get into that hospital.

524
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,920
We know these children are brave people.

525
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,629
And we hope that they escape

526
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,319
with the heart that they need.

527
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,112
Quick!

528
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,837
Go!

529
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,711
Quick!

530
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,549
Go! Quick!

531
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,312
Go! Go!

532
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,952
Just little kids that make
our plan go wrong.

533
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,917
And make the ambassador
less important.

534
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,952
And all this is not in our plan.

535
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,955
No!

536
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,836
Now it might be easier.

537
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,955
No!

538
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,555
This way sir.

539
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,115
Quickly sir.

540
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,037
Wut. We still have another heart.

541
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,198
Yes.

542
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,235
There is another heart.

543
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,072
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

544
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,358
Doctor! Help! please!

545
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:55,754
Can your brother use a woman's heart?

546
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,037
I give it to him.

547
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,789
lf we want her heart,
we must do the operation now.

548
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,360
The attack on the Siam lnter Hospital
by the Tealaw Army

549
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,960
ended with efficient arrests
by the military.

550
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,200
The Thai military has successfully
gained control of the hospital...

551
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,200
...the Thai military have arrested
them safely...

552
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,320
...arrested safely....

553
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:39,960
Police captain Jeerapong Kripong was
hurt while disguised as a doctor.

554
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:46,229
The four children who were in the
hospital to get the heart for
their brother are all safe.

555
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:52,874
They are now on their way to take
a new heart to their brother.

556
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:09,555
It's close to exams and you all
have a lot of homework to do.

557
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,430
After you finished school,
why didn't you come home?
Where have you been?

558
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,909
To get back here to train Thai
boxing like you used to.

559
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,715
I really want to know who had this idea.

560
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,513
Do not blame him!

561
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:37,549
You're all older than him.
You cannot just do what he wants.

562
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,910
Is this wrong?

563
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,999
Jib. You must know you are wrong.

564
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,798
Go. Stand over there.

565
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,073
Because of your dad I will forgive you.

566
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:03,120
Cat. Boxing is for harmony
and to protect yourself,

567
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,315
not to hurt people. Understand?

568
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,990
I told you. It's for harmony.

569
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,952
Who's still not been punished?

570
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,118
Why do you hide from me? Why?

571
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,440
Why?

572
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,589
Softly please.

573
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,312
I cannot.

574
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,759
Again, again.
I'm your dad's best friend.

575
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:31,952
Go!

576
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,989
Wun, come here.

577
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,838
This is all your fault.

578
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,830
Why do I get punished?

579
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,069
It's all because of you making
trouble all of the time.

580
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,515
I will not forgive you.
Turn around.

581
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,951
I don't want to do it.

582
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,431
But it will be an example to them.
