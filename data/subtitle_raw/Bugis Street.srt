What do you think? I am fast worker.

5
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,253
When the rain is over.

6
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,447
When darkness comes.

7
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,583
A long the wall of unending desire.

8
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,296
The butterï¬‚ies spread their wings,
looking for true love.

9
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,189
Hi my name is Sophie!

10
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,585

00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,436
Don't let others know my secret.

20
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,580
Oh so embarrassing.

21
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,080
Give way...give way.

22
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,456

00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,863
Don't want?

32
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,255
Forget it.

33
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,443

We could even become really good friends

I might even buy you a present.

80
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,558

Bye.

92
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,111
Are you the new girl from Melaka?

93
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,621
My name is Lian.
Are you Mrs Hwee?

94
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,420
Welcome to Sin Sin Hotel.

95
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,729
It's not like this everyday!

96
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,123
Come! I'll show you around!

97
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,247
Dear Maria.

98
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,648
Now it is early December,
are you snowing now?

99
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,257
It must be beautiful to have snow.

100
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,791
Here is still hot

101
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,990
and I am in an exotic
new place called Singapore.

102
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,600
Quite unlike Melaka it's so cosmopolitan.

103
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,169
Here I work in a big hotel...

104
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,273
with lots of interesting people.

105
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,343
This morning as I arrived.
I witnessed a sad departure...

106
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:05,005
of an American gentleman
and a Chinese girl.

107
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:09,949
It was so sad, so touching but so lovely.

108
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,921
It's just like The World of Suzie Wong.

109
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,423
The future looks shining brightly for me,
but dear Maria

110
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:21,361
I still miss the simple days
I spent in Melaka

111
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,825
I have to tell you the secret.

112
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:28,865
The day I left the house my young master
actually cried for me.

113
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,434
Please keep this a secret for me.

114
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,734
Yours dearly, Lian.

115
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,133
What are you doing?

116
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,439
I am cleaning your room.

117
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,702
No need for that...

118
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,913

119
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,821
Ah! I beat you

120
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:35,070

121
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,083
Hello!

122
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,350
I brought you
your water basin and a towel.

123
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,086
Thank you.

124
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,251
You must be the new girl
who just came from Melaka yesterday.

125
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,420
My name is Lian.

126
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,826

127
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,930

128
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,037

00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,600
You've such a beautiful view here.

130
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,404
Thank you!
You know I need this balcony...

131
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,014
to make my plants grow

132
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,912
I like to see small things grow bigger?

133
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,712
You didn't catch that did you?

134
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,347
Anyway if you want to
enjoy my view longer.

135
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,960
Clean my room for a longer time OK?

136
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,221
Come let me show you
how to water my plants.

137
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,824
You take a bit of this.

138
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,265
Hi darling I've bought some durian.

139
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,961
Baby you're back.

140
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,768
Lian this is my precious boy Ming

141
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,172
I missed you.

142
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,180
Right I'm going.

143
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,684
Lian can you please bring that
durian to the kitchen?

144
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,458
Hi! Hey you're new here!

145
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,431
Yah! My name's Lian.

146
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,103

147
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,931
Thank you.

148
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:20,802

Go clean up my room now!

151
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,108
Mr. Wong from room 102.

152
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,662
He promised to marry me
and bring me back to Switzerland.

153
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,565
My dream has come true.

154
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,636
He's just a sailor boy.

155
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,468
What is it?

156
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,440
Did you see some fairy last night? Crazy!

157
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,584
What's going on?

158
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,816

By the day or by the hour please?

167
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,863
How do you charge?

168
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,664

169
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,432

If you go out at night we close the door.

176
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,855
But not lock just bring your key!

177

00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,185
May I ask you something?

186
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,624
Yes, What do you want to know?

187
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,892
If someone eats a cockroach
what should he do?

188
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,730
Well he should join the Gourmet Club.

189
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,462
And no more question thank you.

190
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,151
Wake up!

191
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,855
Give me a room!

192
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,156
By the day or by the hour!

193
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,766
Shut up! Are you new here?

194
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,995

195
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,372
Get me a bowl of noodles.

196
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,270
And send it to me in half an hours time.

197
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,877
More sesame oil understand.

198
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,710
Keep the change.

199
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,287
Cocky bitch!

200
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,721
Bless you to be a whore
for the rest of your life.

201
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,976
Did you just join the Gourmet Club?

202
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,177
Oh you are doctor Do!

203
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,278
Ding -a -ling.

204
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,177
Come in!

205
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,448
Your noodle with more sesame oil.

206
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,151
Put in down!

207
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,689
What's the big deal?

208
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,608
What is going on here?

209
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,911
Lian, what're you doing? What is it?

210
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,275
Linda.

211
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,815
What about Linda.

212
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,386
She She's a man!

213
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,155
Oh dear, She's a man? I am a man too.

214
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,347
Lian, wait Lian!...

215
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,845
Lian where you going?

216
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,582
I don't know, back to Melaka.

217
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,986
Don't go, you have to forgive them.

218
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,151
You know some people
are not the same as others.

219
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,264
And I promise they're harmless.

220
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,363
Come back with me please!

221
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,095
Are you coming?

222
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,601
You can go now!

223
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,074
Dear Maria.

224
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,180
The letter I sent you yesterday almost...

225
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,179
became my last letter in Singapore.

226
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,116
So many things happened in one night that
I couldn't even believe it myself.

227
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,618
But I will have the courage to face it

228
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,722
I tell you.

229
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,052
All the ladies in this hotel are men.

230
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,022
Don't you think I really need the courage
to face them. You'll like this place.

231
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,963
This is my home
and it will be your home too.

232
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:31,546
Don't be upset
I frightened you yesterday didn't I?

233
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,546
It's alright.

234
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,182
You know sometimes...

235
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,341
we over do it.

236
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,781
Don't be angry.

237
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,282
This is for you.

238
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,887
This is uncle Chan,

239
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,157
Uncle!

240
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,058
Give her some money for sweet treats.

241
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,660
Thank you uncle.

242
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,653
Good morning Lian.

243
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,022
Good morning.

244
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,424
How are you today?
You look so happy.

245
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,726
We got more for you to do.

246
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,326
Do it nicely please.

247
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,767
What is this strange underwear.

248
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:31,971
It's Lola's.

249
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,373
No it's Lola's boyfriend's.

250
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,039
You know how to blow?

251
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,649
Yes

252
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,786

Why you guys so fucking slow
Just play the fucking card.

261
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,229
What card you throw?

262
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,360
It's a little

263
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,766
Maggie, Maggie Maggie!

264
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,766
Tailor Fong is here.

265
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,736
Don't you know how to play

266
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,044
I'm quitting.

267
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,243
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

268
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,778
You take over Lian

269
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,158
I don't know how.

270
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,729
Never mind, I'll teach you.

271
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,532
Sit down

272
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,932
I can't play.

273
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,108
We'll teach you OK?

274
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,601
Throw this one, throw this one!

275
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,119
We'll teach you how to play

276
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,017
Maggie I can't play! Maggie.

277
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,826
Hurry! Come on Lian!

278
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,625
You've ruined my trump card.

279
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,231
Please wait

280
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:04,386
Lola, Don't do anything silly!

281
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,140
Fuck off!

282
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,011
OK I'll go I'll never come back!

283
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,426
Shit! Shut up!

284
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,258
Dear Maria

285
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,165
I tell you surprise news this time

286
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,066
Maggie gave me a gift the other night

287
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,642
I was so touched
and it was so beautiful that

288
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,336
I never wanted to open it.

289
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,239
It is my first gift in my life

290
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,710
I should treasure it always.

291
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,481
But of course, the gifts
that young master gave me doesn't count.

292
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,182
Those are the secrets between us right?

293
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,622
Well, I forgot to tell you.

294
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,994
Lola's boy friend showed his body to me.

295
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,831
It's so disgusting

296
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:25,302
I think I still prefer poet to muscle man,
do you agree?

297
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,001
Sin Sin Hotel!

298
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,809
Yes we have rooms!

299
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:39,321
I've one secret to tell you girls
about sex change.

300
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,760
After my sex change the next morning...

301
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,227
I woke up suddenly
I realized my cock's gone.

302
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,960
Oh my god, and I shout "Doctor where's
my cock I want my cock back,".

303
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,265
The doctor said
"your cock's gone,

304
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,964
gone forever!"

305
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,235
"I have one good news to tell you."

306
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,878
"You gonna have sex everyday
for the next 6 months."

307
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,644
"To keep your vagina hole open!"

308
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,685
And the most boring is I had
a big equipment. It's so long 7 inch.

309
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,883
Can't throw it away,

310
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,686
Just throw it away.

311
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,456
And my boy friend all the time had sex!
So boring.

312
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,657
Then I discover the paradise here,

313
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:33,206
right here Bugis Street
I can earn a lot of money...

314
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,472
and have sex with a lot of men.

315
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:40,577
Every nigh, every night oh so good,
so lovely.

316
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:46,017
And then I realized,
I'm still a good girl

317
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,422
I was told by the doctor to do so.

318
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,085
Now, I want to tell you
my darkest secrets

319
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,491
I want to be queen of the queens.

320
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:02,730
To be beauty pageant queen
To be a movie queen.

321
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,842
And to get married to a prince
to be a real queen.

322
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,543
It's not easy to be a queen.

323
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,980
You can't leave home with make up.

324
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,581
So no one can see your ugly face.

325
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,275
You can put a lot of jewelry.

326
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:20,253
See like mine
It's fake and nobody knows.

327
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:25,359
Every year I join beauty contest in
Bugis Street. And every year I lose

328
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,253
I'm fed up to join beauty contest.

329
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,997
But trust me,

330
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,965
one day I'll be queen of Bugis Street.

331
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,071
And I'll be queen of the queens

332
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,302
I've always admired...

333
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,107
Sophia Loren's big tits.

334
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,217
So I started to save up so that

335
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,377
I could have a pair of big tits like her

336
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,288
I went to the doctor

337
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,188
I ordered the biggest pair
of tits they have.

338
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,522
After I returned home
my friends saw me and.

339
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:06,327
They said what beautiful papayas
you got there.

340
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:11,132
Then they said shall we play mahjong?

341
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,172
Alright so we started playing mahjong.

342
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:19,179
We played and played &
I was totally excited.

343
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:23,149
Then suddenly I heard "Bam"!

344
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,751
My breast had collapsed!

345
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:29,791
And my white dress turned red

346
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,157
I looked at it and my god!

347
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,456
And the next day
I went to the doctor to have it fixed.

348
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,360
But this time I didn't want it big

349
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,796
I wanted small ones.

350
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,095
Come in!

351
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,861
More tea ladies and gentlemen?

352
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,901
Oh so beautiful.

353
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,007
Come on in.

354
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,303
Thank you.

355
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,467
What is it?

356
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,773
Oh this is a movie camera.

357
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,476
Since you are in this room you know what?
We are going to dress you up.

358
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,584

364
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,328
So many

365
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,231
I'll tell you one.

366
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,766
In Melaka, young master.

367
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:25,141
So young. So handsome.
So rich. So many women.

368
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,475
But young master's only crazy about me.

369
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,147
Other maids got jealous.

370
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,346
That's why I come here.

371
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,048
Do all your dirty laundry and underwear.

372
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,748
Oh you don't like being with us?

373
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:41,757
No! I like you all
You are very nice to me.

374
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,292
But, when young master comes

375
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,470
I'll hire all of you to be my maids.

376
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,569
And do my dirty laundry and underwear

377
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,173
I don't believe her story.

378
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,400
She can go home! She's lying.

379
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,476
Maid? No way!

380
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:02,108
Ya! Lola,
you tell me your deep secrets huh?

381
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,217
My darkest secrets?

382
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,814
I'm afraid I'd wake up one morning
and my breasts would disappear.

383
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:16,227
Just joking!

384
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:25,436
My secrets! I hate Ming

385
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,974
I hate him so much
I'm so happy he's not around!

386
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:32,945
Yes! He lies to me, he cheats me
Sometimes he beats me yeah.

387
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,749
Even goes out with other women
I'm not stupid

388
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,457
I picked him up
when I was 18 in Bugis Street

389
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,755
I was such a flower then.

390
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,296
Everyone wanted me.

391
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:55,297
You know there was this rich gentleman
from Switzerland who wanted to marry me

392
00:34:55,493 --> 00:35:00,704
I would be living in his big house
with lots of servants

393
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,107
I'd be so grand.

394
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,714
Not only did I give up
everything for Ming

395
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,512
I even educated him.

396
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,419
Yeah! I taught him
the finer things in life.

397
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,751
Everything he wears I bought him

398
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,164
I bought him jewelry, I paid his bills

399
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,459
I paid his gambling debts

400
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,034
I hate him!

401
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,609
I hate him so much
I'm so happy he's not around

402
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,349
I miss him so much

403
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,517
I forgot my sunglasses!

404
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,062
Damn your sunglasses!

405
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,410
Get away. . .get away.

406
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:57,347
Sin Sin Hotel... Yes we have rooms...
Thank you.

407
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,497
Anybody here.

408
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,508
May I help you.

409
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,437
This is my passport.

410
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,712
Don't be surprised,
the sex is male...

411
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,339
and my name is Drags.

412
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,652
And I'd like to have a room with a view.

413
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,319
By the day or by the hour.

414
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,649
It's timeless.

415
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,019
It all depends how long I will stay.

416
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,452
And by the way these are my luggage.

417
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:45,225
Do handle with care. They are from Paris.
They are Louis Vuitton.

418
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,143
You are the most well dressed
receptionist I've ever seen.

419
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,973
Especially in this kind of place.

420
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,540
Where you come from?

421
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,617
I come from a land
that you can only dream of.

422
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,819
What kind of men do you like?

423
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,077
The kind of men that I like

424
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,622
would not like someone like you.

425
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,692
By the way this is my name card.

426
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,387
There's a lot you can learn from me.

427
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,692
What a queen!

428
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,600
Sour grapes! Luggage please!

429
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,608
Oh whenever I come back to Singapore
It's the monsoon season.

430
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:42,922
Today I'm going to teach you
French cooking -Es-car-got!

431
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,658
First you have to wash the Es-car-got.

432
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,458
Make sure it's clean
so you won't have tummy upsets.

433
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,066
Listen here stop playing with food
It's very rude.

434
00:39:54,425 --> 00:40:00,569
Next you have to grind the garlic,
mix it with butler, into a rich paste.

435
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,645
And then you shovel
it into the Es-car-got.

436
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,245
It's very Parisian.

437
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,049
What?

438
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,780
Very Parisian! People from Paris.

439
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,945
And now I'm going to make mussels while

440
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,285
you wash the Es-car-got.

441
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,984
Tell me something about Paris

442
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,195
Paris!

443
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:29,397
Paris! Oh Paris, it is the end of dreams
for people like us.

444
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:36,978
There is freedom, Glamour,
Spirituality, Physicality.

445
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:42,277
And there is this big boulevard
called Champs Elysees.

446
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:48,817
And there is Arc de Triomphe
It is L'etoile.

447
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,630
The star, it shines so
brightly throughout the whole of Paris.

448
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,633
Sometimes, when I look at Bugis Street.

449
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,236
It reminds me so much of Arc de Triomphe.

450
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:07,242
Shining for people like us
Over the whole of the Universe.

451
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,638
When do you know your were like this?

452
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,247
Like what? Beautiful?

453
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,074
I was born beautiful!

454
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,845
Not everybody has the opportunity
to come out of their closet.

455
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,749
Some don't.

456
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:24,155
These days, it is sad people
don't live life for themselves.

457
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,384
Are you a lesbian, Lian.

458
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,653
Be careful!

459
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,856
Are you OK?

460
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,564
What's the problem?

461
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:52,004
I don't know!
I don't know what's the problem.

462
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:58,275
Why always must be me!
Why am I always the unlucky one?

463
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:08,614
It's so difficult to survive
It's enough,

464
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:12,325
it's enough I got enough already.

465
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,177
Girls we have all been men before!

466
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,843
We know it is so difficult
to battle the women for their men.

467
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:42,890
That is why I'm here to share
with you my beauty secrets!

468
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,460
Today it will be Beaute du Bust.

469
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,655
You are so beautiful
like my long lost sister from Africa.

470
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:55,200
And for you, your eyebrows,
they need polishing.

471
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,397
And as for these, they have potential

472
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:02,042
but with Beaute du
Bust you reach the stars.

473
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,338
As for you my child you always looks glum.

474
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,745
You are the epitome of oriental beauty.

475
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,318
What a beautiful ring!

476
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,513
But with this your exterior comes alive.

477
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,219
Girls we are all born beautiful

478
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,021
but we need beauty aids.

479
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,824
And the two of you
You are so obscene.

480
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,962
Pay attention if you want to be ladies!

481
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,934
Is it very very expensive?

482
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,835
It's never expensive to pay for beauty.

483
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,534
But if all of you are interested
I have a cheaper range.

484
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:41,843
It' Beaute du Bust Two.

485
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:47,445
It serves the same function
But it takes a long time.

486
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:52,152
You want quick results don't you girls?

487
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:56,560
That's why I recommend Beaute du Bust One.

488
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,224
In one month you get breasts like mine.

489
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,515
Do you like my perfume?...

490
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,445
Yesterday I saw a gold chain at Po Hing!

491
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,015
Want me to get it for you?

492
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:30,623
You like it?

493
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,627
Yes.

494
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,139
You like my scratches?

495
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,239
I give you more!

496
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,028
Go to the bank
I want some money.

497
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,423
Later.

498
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,697
Now!

499
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,431
You don't be naughty while I'm gone OK?

500
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,916
Remember to ask Lian to change
the light blub

501
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,731
I come to change the light bulb

502
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,330
I'm coming!

503
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:59,553
I've come to change the light bulb
I've come to change the light bulb!

504
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,482
Where's the light?

505
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,081
There!

506
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,092
Light bulb's OK,

507
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,298
Please you're leaning too close.

508
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:22,806
Do you like my body?

509
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:28,505
The lightbulb's OK I'm going.

510
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,819
What a sight!

511
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,862
What a pretty leg and ass!

512
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,467
What is doing now? Look!

513
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,528
Look at those legs

514
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:53,864
I'm gonna make them naked tonight.

515
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:54,873
It's a sin.

516
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,479
Very easy. You don't believe it?
Let me try it!

517
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,577
It doesn't work at all

518
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,921
oh so sad they're gone!

519
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:17,893
The face so handsome
The body is just right for me.

520
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,624
Ah they're gone.

521
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,928
No! they're coming back again

522
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,595
I'll make some black magic.

523
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,864
Which one do you like Sophie?

524
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,626
I am not cheap scale as you

525
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,972
I love them all.

526
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,440
Don't forget we promised to do
a lesbian show for free

527
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:07,140
I won't do it for free!

528
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,343
Please just once
and for all please Sophie?

529
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,956
I always think of your big strong arms...

530
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:30,502
wrapped around my body.

531
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,698
Your broad chest your tight butt against
my face,

532
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,274
lets go upstairs again.

533
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,207
No!

534
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,368
I want more of you!

535
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,922
Hi Lian! Hey we're going shopping
you want anything?

536
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,484
See you later!

537
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:07,338
How are you today you look beautiful!

538
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:11,276
Can you please prepare my mother's bill,
I'll pick it up later!

539
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,379
Thank you!

540
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,345
Hi! Can we take a picture with you?

541
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,075
No problem, hold this!

542
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,248
Position girls!

543
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,981
Smile, 1 ,2.

544
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:22,955
Thank you.

545
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,354
Don't you want my autograph?

546
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,050
No, next time!

547
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,161
Then next time, right?

548
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,854
Basket please!

549
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,507
Hello missie!

550
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,404
Hello it's you again,
you brought life here.

551
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,806
Yes I'm hereto see my mummy!

552
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,774
How are you?

553
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,609
How are you?

554
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,875
You look gorgeous!

555
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,884
I know! You must use Beaute du Bust.

556
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,079
It'll help you in your career.

557
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,487
Look what has done for mine!

558
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,092
What is Beaute du.

559
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,324
Beaute du Bust I'll tell you later,

560
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,525
hello mummy! Hi my dear

561
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,961
I brought you fruit!

562
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,133
Thank you.

563
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,929
And how have you been keeping.

564
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,069
Fine!

565
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,967
Have they been treating you well, mummy?

566
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,765
Yes, you look so pretty today!

567
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:18,242
- Thank you mummy it's the latest makeup.
- YSL, Yang Shiao, Ling!

568
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,937
Your so popular here my sweetheart

569
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,074
I know mummy,
each time when I come and visit you

570
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,550
they want to take pictures with me.

571
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:29,346
It makes me feel like a movie star.

572
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,316
Come in!

573
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,513
Coffee de Paris?

574
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,415
You can put my coffee on my dresser.

575
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:05,818
Come and have a look.

576
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:06,927
What's that?

577
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,324
A picture frame, my mother gave me!

578
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,862
So pretty!

579
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,762
Isn't she lovely

580
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,027
I used to hear people say...

581
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,226
she is from a wealthy family.

582
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:16,927
No!

583
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,540
I used not to believe that
Pictures don't lie, do they!

584
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,332
And your father?

585
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,068
Don't talk about him.

586
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,140
He left us when I was six,

587
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,641
such a wicked man he was.

588
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:32,479
And my poor beautiful mother,
suffered silently.

589
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,246
She just don't tell.

590
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:41,795
A lot of men came for her, many big cars,

591
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:45,296
beautiful faces in suits and hats,
she didn't want to go.

592
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,759
Silly woman! She chose to suffer.

593
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,169
But it's all for a good reason,
she gave birth to me.

594
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:55,799
She didn't mind me, for what I am,

595
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,071
she said "Mother knows best".

596
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,076
And I said.

597
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,239
"Well thank you for you."

598
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:02,913
So cute!

599
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,510
That's me, and that's my little sister.

600
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,619
Don't you think I'm prettier.

601
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,023
Let me tell you my secret.

602
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,863
When I was young
I used to like to look at men.

603
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:26,132
Men with muscles, like Hercules,
Tarzan, Steve Reeves.

604
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,637
Don't you like muscles?

605
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,441
Why not?

606
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,943
Ugly!

607
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,439
Let me tell you of my first love.

608
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:41,545
When I was 16, I fell in love.

609
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:47,952
In love not with a muscle man,
but with an old man.

610
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,164
To me it was love.

611
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:52,760
To him.

612
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:57,360
He wasn't sure that a younger
person could love an older person.

613
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,939
He said, "Go back and think about it"!

614
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:05,612
So I went back and thought about it,
and I came back and I said

615
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,509
I love you!

616
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:12,246
And after 2 months, he dumped me.

617
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,854
That much for love.

618
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,423
And that much for older balding men.

619
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,261
How do you know you're in love?

620
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:29,736
When you in love, it's like a butterï¬‚y
flying non-stop in your tummy

621
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:33,369
I don't want a butterï¬‚y in my tummy!

622
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,441
Yes you do someday!

623
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,477
And it's not everyday
you get that feeling.

624
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,582
Today, I'll show you the paradise...

625
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,786
of budding young creatures.

626
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,055
See anyone you like Lian?

627
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:02,336
I forgot, you're a real girl,
shy and demure.

628
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,734
Not like us, a little fake

629
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,433
I used to play a game, a secret game.

630
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:15,650
If you see a boy that you like,
and make a wish, count to three.

631
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,012
If he turns back and smiles at you.

632
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,449
He is yours for the taking!

633
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:33,562
Go on!

634
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:34,827
OK!

635
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:37,332
Go for it!

636
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,343
Oh come on let's go somewhere!

637
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,229
Have you ever been in love before,
little girl?

638
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,890
Is that a yes or no?

639
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,191
What kind of man do you like?

640
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,498
I used to like the romantic, poetic type.

641
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:15,606
But now I think muscle man
like Tarzan is OK too.

642
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,807
You learn fast & competition.

643
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:24,851
No! You know in Melaka my young master
is still waiting for me.

644
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,212
Very lucky girl!

645
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,819
Do you like what you've see today Lian?

646
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,325
Very interesting!

647
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,726
Hello ladies and gentlemen!

648
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,127
Hello beauties,

649
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,824
more beauty tips for you?

650
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,065
Beauty tips?

651
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:41,827
Yes!

652
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,732
What have you done to my breasts?

653
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,235
What happened to your breasts?

654
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,635
Are you going to cheat us.

655
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,138
Oh I won't dare!

656
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,969
Gimme my money back you bitch!

657
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,739
You have to be more lady
like with the girl!

658
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,979
You think you are a lady? Go away!

659
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,145
How can I be a beauty queen...

660
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,251
when my breasts...

661
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,820
are like this.

662
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,600
Oh my god, what the hell.

663
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:23,711
Mrs Hwee, Mrs Hwee, come on Mrs Hwee!

664
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,705
I am bleeding lam dying.

665
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,114
Who hit her. She did

666
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,413
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

667
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,323
Lian, Lian how old are you?

668
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,825
16!

669
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,461
Has she come before?

670
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:43,753
Whom?

671
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,558
Your big auntie!

672
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,935
I got no big auntie.

673
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:52,573
Lian,
your big auntie has just arrived today!

674
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,424
True love,

675
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:18,531
dear dear Maria,
I finally found it!

676
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:23,637
He smiles at me he talks to me,
he dates me!

677
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,405
I tell you more some other time.

678
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:30,300
This is just a shod note
to tell you I'm in love.

679
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,309
And to tell you from today onwards,

680
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:36,850
I'm a woman
But don't think anything wicked

681
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:41,318
I'm still pure as a lamb
You just have to take my word for it.

682
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,061
Come on boys come on!

683
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,784
Sisters, your friends have arrived

684
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,859
I am going to play my favorite song.

685
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,344
Lian, let me help you,

686
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:19,851
Lola, Mrs Hwee.

687
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:26,450
Mrs Hwee I am working

688
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,685
I'll give new life to your face

689
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:01,819
Rouge, mascara and luscious red lips.

690
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,263
My face!

691
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:09,430
Calm down,
I'm going to give your body a new body!

692
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,936
A new corset

693
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,168
I've got no cloths on.

694
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:21,040
Calm down! And now I'm going to
give you a new hairstyle.

695
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,946
To be like queen of Egypt, Cleopatra.

696
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,344
My head is itchy!

697
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,990
That why you have nails,

698
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,251
you can scratch it!

699
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,994
The night comes alive for you!

700
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,660
So come on little butterï¬‚y!

701
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:50,672
Quiet please, quiet please, quiet please!

702
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,679
We have something to announce.

703
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,282
Ladies and gentlemen, we present,

704
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,883
Snow White of Bugis Street.

705
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:02,321
Don't be shy! Tummy in, breasts out!

706
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,761
You don't have to be jealous
of beautiful girls Zsa Zsa.

707
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,230
She's s witch.

708
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:16,664
Yes isn't she!

709
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:20,466
Look at her,
she's such a pretty little girl.

710
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,166
Isn't she? Just like us.

711
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,639
You ought to make a lot of money
in Bugis Street.

712
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:24,836
We'll make a lot of money.

713
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,445
Come with me.

714
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,879
Remember, Cleopatra.

715
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,758
Left, right. . . left, right.

716
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:50,570
Girls girls girls,
I want to be raped tonight by six men.

717
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:52,695
Quiet! You and I have the same dream.

718
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:56,901
You say so, not true not true,
and then we'll become lesbians.

719
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,611
Naughty boys again, come let's go!

720
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,013
I'll see you later.

721
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:10,351
You guys have potential, Very good,

722
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,323
if you want to know more
about sisters of the night.

723
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,919
Look for us at Bugis Street

724
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,156
I have to go now! Bye!

725
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,540
Now you should pay me some money!

726
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,940
I'm sorry.

727
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:37,277
Come on, take a photo with Snow White
at Bugis Street.

728
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,049
How much did you make, Lian,

729
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,953
Who do you think you are?

730
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,151
Who is she?

731
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,262
She is my sister.

732
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:52,355
Go, Lian.

733
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:55,901
She is my little sister

734
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:55,552
Sophie.

735
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,687
Zsa Zsa What's happening?

736
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:01,630
Lian, my dreams come true.

737
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:18,617
How's your night?

738
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,048
Very confusing.

739
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,613
Lian!

740
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:23,919
Yes.

741
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:28,220
Well it's not finished yet!
Go up and fix Lola's lightbulb!

742
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,627
Not again!

743
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,337
No more bulbs!

744
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,641
Find one!

745
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:20,209
Oh it's you!

746
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,149
Who are you?

747
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,354
I came to change the lightbulb.

748
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:36,922
You are Lian?

749
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:44,163
Oh you look different!

750
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:53,639
May <i>I</i> help you?

751
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:54,837
No!

752
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:57,646
Give me that.

753
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,090
Please!

754
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,008
I like you in black.

755
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,515
It's real this time.

756
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,970
Why is it that every time I see you
you are always in your underwear?

757
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,545
Do you like it?

758
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,878
Like it or not it's none of your business.

759
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,433
And now, I know the rewards of make up

760
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,574
and the price I have to pay.

761
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:06,744
It gives me the courage to do the things
I've never done before.

762
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,950
Somehow, after taking off that mask

763
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,644
I am never the same simple girl anymore.

764
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,654
How strange it is to be mature,

765
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,556
and how wonderful
it is to experience new things.

766
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:26,324
But sometimes, later at night.

767
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:31,596
There are still moments when I long
for the sunny breezy days in Melaka.

768
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,675
They seem so far away now!

769
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:25,591
Dear Maria

770
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:29,696
I'm so happy to tell you
that he remains unchanged.

771
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:33,789
Enchanted, infatuated.

772
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:42,870
My true love is a hope for me to lean on
My guiding light, a way to survive.

773
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:00,716
Ma!

774
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:06,024
What happened to you?
You dressed like a man!

775
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:09,634
But I am a man, or I was a man!

776
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:13,762
Meet my fiance Lian.
This time it's a real girl!

777
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,435
How many fiancees have you had?

778
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:20,644
The kind of fiance you want to
get married to, and have children!

779
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,180
Don't tease me!

780
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,682
After so many years,
I got used to having a daughter.

781
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,345
And now I have you back as a son!

782
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,047
Oh I'm confused.

783
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,281
Don't be!

784
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,187
Sit down!

785
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:37,555
Where you from?

786
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,960
Melaka.

787
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:40,599
Isn't she a doll, mummy?

788
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,291
Yes

789
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,079
I really like your mother

790
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,814
I think she likes you tool...

791
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,885
If it wasn't for her,
I don't know where I'd be

792
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,513
I've traveled so widely,
done so many things.

793
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,521
But somehow I still feel very lost

794
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:10,720
I spent all my money
on expensive clothing and fake jewelry.

795
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,666
Not even had enough to stay
in a decent hotel.

796
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:16,564
Not that Sin Sin is bad.

797
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,433
After all, I'm just a traveling salesman.

798
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,637
Sales man!

799
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,371
It's more like a sales woman!

800
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,344
Have a look!

801
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:49,258
Are you a lesbian, Drago?

802
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:14,417
I visit Drago's mother
many times afterwards.

803
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:17,822
Sometimes with Drago,
sometimes by myself.

804
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,657
Her inner strength amazes me.

805
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,234
To bring up a child born as a daughter

806
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,336
but embodied as a son.

807
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:30,036
What courage it takes to break
all the traditional values.

808
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,844
It takes a lifetime to fight.

809
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,577
And now she's tired.

810
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,085
How we gonna do it tonight

811
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,887
I really want it rough and I want it bad

812
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:03,201
Lola! Lola!

813
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:43,042
You alright Lola?
Talk to me, Lola talk to me!

814
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,869
I want to die!

815
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:54,946
Lola, Lola clam down!
You wanna die? You wanna die!

816
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:58,547
Even I don't do things like that
How could you, how dare you!

817
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:03,794
He'll me!

818
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,192
No!

819
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:25,507
Oh Maria Dear
I don't know how to tell you this

820
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,510
I'm so curious about life,

821
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,524
but I'm so ignorant
I want to learn

822
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,821
I want to see things clearly.

823
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:38,124
But I feel a hopeless
destruction within me

824
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:42,067
I want to be good
I want to be free.

825
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:45,261
Free from all the lies I told you

826
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,230
Maria, forgive me

827
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:02,921
I've never seen a girl as pretty
as you in Singapore

828
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,115
I bet you do really clean laundry.

829
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:06,692
Will you do some for me?

830
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:07,883
Sure!

831
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:10,124
Then I'll take them off!

832
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:11,689
Don't take them off here!

833
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:14,230
Then where?

834
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:18,436
Put them back on!

835
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:20,038
So clean!

836
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:26,044
The black magic has no effect on Ming.

837
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,943
So Lola turns to Buddha instead.

838
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,718
The morning before she goes to Penang,

839
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:34,820
she prayed so beautifully

840
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,426
I'm praying for true love.

841
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,724
Do you want true love?

842
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,563
On day you'll find it too!

843
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,961
True love, what is true love?

844
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,966
She doesn't want it and I don't have it!

845
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,107
Are you leaving?

846
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,345
Come and sit down!

847
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,826
My mother wants you to have this.

848
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,630
She likes you a lot.

849
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:56,865
How is she?

850
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:07,776
She's gone!
My business here is over

851
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,574
I'm going back to Paris.

852
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:12,443
No!

853
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,047
Oh how I miss her!

854
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:26,760
I'll be alright

855
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:32,700
I'll survive. You'll survive.

856
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,068
Live goes on you know.

857
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:56,985
Can I send you off?

858
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:59,530
I think it's better that
you stay at the hotel.

859
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:01,229
What a surprise!

860
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,927
My sweetheart
I bought something for you.

861
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,126
Thank you,

862
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,236
this is Choi, Lian!

863
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,373
Hello!

864
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,667
This is Lian.

865
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,169
Here comes the bus

866
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,744
I have to go now

867
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,144
I'll write to you, and you write back.

868
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:41,907
Bye.

869
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,566
Bye!

870
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,753
That was the last time I saw Drago.

871
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,923
She's truly remarkable.

872
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,129
She can go anywhere with her...

873
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,360
Louis Vuitton and find a helping hand

874
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,560
I don't mean bad

875
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,338
I think she has love within her.

876
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,150
What's your name?

877
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,656
Lee Man Kit? You must be very rich.

878
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:33,953
You wear expensive clothes

879
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:37,096
I love your hair. It's trendy.

880
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:39,596
Look at him, he's cute.

881
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:43,395
If you are jealous you should get a man.

882
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:49,074
How did you come here?

883
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,177
Came here by boat!

884
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,608
You've eloped?

885
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,179
Lian, young master come all the way...

886
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:56,713
from Melaka to see you.

887
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:57,975
Cute!

888
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,208
He's so handsome!

889
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,614
Do you miss Lian?

890
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,618
He must be from a rich family.

891
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,950
Ah Kit, what are you doing here?

892
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:07,320
Lian, I came here to see you.

893
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,446
You go back tomorrow.

894
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,353
No, I miss you
I just want to see you

895
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:51,103
I'm OK here
Master will worry for you.

896
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:05,316
This is for you, I made it myself.

897
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,852
It's pretty.

898
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:13,818
Thank you.

899
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,426
Do you like it?

900
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,739
I got Chinese tea leaves for your father
Give it to him please.

901
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:33,344
Oh thanks.

902
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,948
These are very expensive Chinese
herb especially for your father.

903

Take care of yourself

take care yourself

921
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:47,641
take care yourself.

01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,145

924

Stay home!

925
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:02,694
I miss you! Bye Bye!

926
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,886
Bye Bye, take care!

927
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,111
Bye Bye!

928
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,741
Lian, Don't forget to prepare
some hot water for tomorrow.

929
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:09,644
Ship's coming to town.

930
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,346
Don't forget!

931
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,207
Are you OK Lian.

932
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:47,377
This is my boy friend Singh!

933
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,729
Sure you're OK?

934
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:05,427
More sesame oil!

935
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:53,071
Nobody's here!

936
01:35:17,745 --> 01:35:18,917
Dear Maria.

937
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,519
This is my last letter to you.

938
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:26,822
Because I am so sad, that writing letters
no longer has meaning

939
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:30,258
I must admit throughout our penpalship,

940
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:33,462
I created a fantasy world of my own.

941
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,535
But now I realized the only real thing...

942
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:39,974
that exists for me
is the one person I detest.

943
01:35:40,768 --> 01:35:42,543
Even he's gone.

944
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:45,283
Please forgive me again.

945
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:49,246
Come let's go! That's OK.

946
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:51,450
Morning, sister.

947
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,385
My water's boiled!

948
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:58,758
Your figure is fantastic
I'll stitch more tight.

949
01:35:58,886 --> 01:35:59,557
Really?

950
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:00,528
Really!

951
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:02,929
Thank you!

952
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:11,406
I miss him, especially his body.

953
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,840
Please, he's gone forever!

954
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:19,109
Hi Lian! Come on tell you some secrets,

955
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:21,409
Lola's lover's gone.

956
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:23,749
She is very sad inside.

957
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:26,915
By the way if you see him,
send our regards to him.

958
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:28,958
We miss him very much, OK?

959
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:30,220
Bye!

960
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,442
Come in!

961
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:57,083
Hi!

962
01:36:57,244 --> 01:36:59,190
Your water basin and the towel.

963
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:00,791
Thank you.

964
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:10,434
Lian what's wrong
Are you out of love?

965
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:15,032
Are you OK?

966
01:37:15,696 --> 01:37:17,505
It's love yeah!

967
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:20,210
Let me tell you about love.

968
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:24,214
Love is like this hotel,
people come in and out all the time.

969
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:27,410
Sometimes there's long term guest like me.

970
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:30,211
But nothing stays forever.

971
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:32,654
If your good they'll come back.

972
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:35,726
It they don't come back don't worry,
it's not because you're bad.

973
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:38,920
Sometimes they just want to try
something different.

974
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:45,235
Hey baby!
I brought you some durian.

975
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:48,134
Darling your back I missed you.

976
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:54,845
Hey Lien, come here!

977
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,473
I want you to meet Wah Jai.

978
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,640
He's got such a nice body yes!

979
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,286
Could you please bring the durian
to the kitchen?

980
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:05,113
Thank you!

981
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:29,206
I'm going to the market.

982
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:31,009
Alright don't be late!

983
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:34,510
Can I have a room for 3 days please.

984
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:39,751
Course you may!
I'll give you 103...

985
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:41,621
this is our most special room here.

986
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:42,725
Oh thank you.

987
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,225
By the way where you from

988
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:45,362
I'm from Bangkok.

989
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:49,261
Oh welcome to Sin Sin Hotel
Hope you have a good time.

990
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,971
Dear Maria.

991
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:06,278
Forget about my last letter

992
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:08,109
I have to tell you finally that...

993
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:11,188
I discover
that life is just like our hotel.

994
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,614
People come in and out all the time.

995
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,090
Sometimes you come across nice clients...

996
01:39:16,216 --> 01:39:17,786
who treat you really well.

997
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:20,026
And sometimes you have nasty ones...

998
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,528
who mess up the rooms...

999
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:23,691
and takes you hours to clean up.

1000
01:39:24,391 --> 01:39:26,029
But ups and downs,

1001
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:28,502
that is what life is promising you.
