Commissioner, he is your nephew.

21
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,386
That's shit!

22
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,653
Give me the bullet proof vest.

23
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,746
Yes Sir!

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,027
Merciful God, please give me power.

25
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,254
To let the thieves surrender
automatically.

26
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,762
I've been a negotiation expert
for quite a long time.

27
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,298
But I've done none successful case.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,267
God, please let me make one case
successfully, okay?

29
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,427
Ken!

30
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,903
Uncle!

31
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,605
Be smart! If you mess up again.

32
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,471
That Spider woman
will attack me again.

33
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,374
She is under you!
Why'd you be afraid of her?

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,606
But some female Legisco members
support her.

35
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,145
Said she is
the tight of women in police,

36
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,976

37
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,047
That's shit!

38
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,551
Commissioner Wong, the vest.

39
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,119
Your mom asked me
to take care of you before she died.

40
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,125
Wear it! You've one life only.

41
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,319
Where is mine?

42
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,622
Sorry, we've only one left.

43
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:11,858
Uncle!

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,796
You are young and smart!

45
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,558
Youth'd lake risk.

46
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,534
So as to train him to smart
and successful.

47
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,502
Are you scared?

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,400
Don't be afraid,
the God will protect you.

49
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,740
Stop! Bullet's no big deal!

50
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,248
Uncle!

51
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,644
The light of woman.

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,409
Spider woman!

53
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,579
Why you are wet in such cold weather?

54
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,650
It's small case,
since you're too old.

55
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,454
Why not take a rest at home?

56
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,428
Calm down...

57
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,829
Since she is woman!

58
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,165
Or I'll chop them out.

59
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,896
So she can't milk!

60
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,234
Asking me?

61
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,777
Where have you last night?
Why didn't you call me?

62
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,046
To play mahjong!

63
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,543
You've used 5 minutes to answer!
Cunning you!

64
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,683
Who did you play with?

65
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,447
Turtle, Bull, and chicken.

66
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,688
You answer so fast! You must
have recited it several times.

67
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,849
Win or lose?

68
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,286
I've lost $200.

69
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,392
I give you $300
as pocket money per month.

70
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,259
How can you lose $200
by the end of the month?

71
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,592
You must have kept a lot with you.

72
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,633
It's my red pocket money.

73
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,599
Well, give me $1,000 more
for saving staring from next month.

74
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,692
What?

75
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,805
You can refuse,
I can refuse to marry you too.

76
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,453
The people inside listen!

77
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,090
I'm the liaison expert
from the Police Dept.

78
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,930
I'm sincere.

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,734
I want to enter and talk to you.

80
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,063
You are surrounded by us,

81
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,434
you have no way out.

82
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,474
If you don't surrender,
you'll be dead meal.

83
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,318
Ken, save the hostages.

84
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,249
What?

85
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,150
You are nearest to them.

86
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,813
Save the hostage.
Yes Madam!

87
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,388
Miss...

88
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,920
Don't move.

89
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,031
Don't move, don't get closed.

90
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,761
Be careful of me!

91
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,801
Go in!

92
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,179
How dare you hurt my wife?

93
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,449
None of my business.

94
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,682
I can tell you are telling lies
from your eyes.

95
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,119
My eyes itch!

96
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,390
Undress!

97
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,726
You can beat me!

98
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,921
But you have no reason to rape me!

99
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,396
Bottle playing!

100
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,304
We are playing - Russian Roulette.

101
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,743
I'll shoot
whom with a pointed bottle.

102
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,381
One, two!

103
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,011
Three!

104
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,453
Let's play in 3!

105
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,544
Three?

106
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,295
May I be excused?

107
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,773
I'll add one more.

108
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,773
What?

109
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,637
You and 1, 2 men, we've 4 together.

110
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,573
No!

111
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,939
I've got one only.

112
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,375
I've 3 then.

113
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,010
Don't!

114
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,303
Are you happy?

115
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,235
No!

116
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,768
I'm painful!

117
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,132
Let's play six this time!

118
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,859
No! I've to play, I'm not satisfied!

119
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,656
Wait for me, I'll be back.

120
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,889
Wait for me!

121
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,893
Don't point at me...

122
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,698
How are you? Are you okay?

123
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,500
You kill him!

124
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,706
Uncle, mom asked you
to take care of me.

125
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,175
Sure, I'm doing what she instructed.

126
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,075
I'm not asking you
to be undercover cop.

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,441
But to be an undercover in school,
to act as teacher.

128
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,976
What should I do?
To investigate the triads?

129
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,617
The students!

130
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,288
A Taiwan kid, nicked named Doggie.

131
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,716
Raise your legs.

132
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:38,916
Yes!

133
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,024
I see! You practice
your scissors legs in this way.

134
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,188
Nosy!

135
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,230
I'll break your head!

136
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,593
The kid's dad, Blackie Ko is
an VIP in Taiwan Triad Society.

137
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,228
Recently, he promised to co-operate
with the cops.

138
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,897
To change against 2 triad heads,

139
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,170
but the evidence is taken
by his ex-wife.

140
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,244
Search his ex-wife then.

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,607
She died 3 months ago
in a car accident.

142
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,273
Maybe, his son will know it.

143
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,407
So search his son.

144
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,447
But the kid hates his dad so much.

145
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,078
He deny knowing Blackie.

146
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,918
I've found some clue that.

147
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,083
He may be a student in
St. Yoke Keung High School.

148
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,201
How he looks like?

149
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,437
His dad can't even recognize him
by that picture.

150
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,008
He was 7 when his dad last saw him.

151
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,134
Now, he is 17 years old.

152
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,639
The only thing to be recognized.

153
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,214
Is a birthmark,
a dog shape on the ass.

154
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,473
But I've got some information.

155
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,451
Taiwan triads are coming
to assassinate him.

156
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,456
So we must search Doggie first.

157
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,582
It's so difficult for me!

158
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,962
Spider woman is pushing me!

159
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,593
If you can't find him,
I'll put you in deep shit.

160
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,064
I'm afraid I'm not capable.

161
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,431
Well, I'll teach you my Kung-fu.

162
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,136
My most powerful kung-fu
is not scissors legs.

163
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,605
But Super Palms, right?

164
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,468
No! I've to play, I'm not satisfied!

165
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,238
Super finger!

166
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,644
Super finger?

167
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,264
This is no big deal.

168
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,999
You can do it.

169
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,565
My sole finger can support
my whole body.

170
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,078
If you can move the glass
with one finger.

171
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,615
You are successful!

172
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,066
To be an undercover,
I'd keep the secret.

173
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,759
But I've to report
to Hing 3 times a day.

174
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,797
You'd brush that sharp
longued woman off.

175
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,271
We've been together for 3 years!

176
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,338
3 years? Have you had sex?

177
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,407
No!

178
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,469
You can't spoil them!

179
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,909
What are you chatting?
Is my bra ready?

180
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,983
Sure! I want to Iron more
to make it softer.

181
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,345
So you'll feel more comfortable.

182
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,514
Let's separate.

183
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,186
Why do you cry?

184
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,827
It's useless, you know?

185
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,531
Calm down!

186
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,434
Why do you kneel down?

187
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,267
The passengers are looking,
are you kidding?

188
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,638
Don't pull my trousers,

189
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,768
I'll hit you, I swear!

190
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,106
Go to hell!

191
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,805
Stop it!

192
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,617
Am I cool enough?

193
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,553
You are cold blooded!

194
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,353
If I walk away right
after talking to her.

195
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,928
She'll cry terribly.

196
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,155
Please help me, watch over her.

197
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,733
I'm afraid she'd jump and suicide.

198
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,630
It's so difficult for me!

199
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,861
Okay, I know how.

200
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,634
She is coming.

201
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,671
I've something to tell you.

202
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:23,849
Go ahead!

203
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,811
Let's separate!

204
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,746
What?

205
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,753
I said... let's separate.

206
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,524
Why don't you stop it?

207
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,958
I am telling you.

208
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,587
We separate now.

209
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,224
Why?

210
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,867
It's no use for you to cry!

211
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,135
We'd keep calm.

212
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,968
I don't want to be calm.

213
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,475
No...

214
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,510
Don't leave me, don't!

215
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,673
Don't pull my legs!

216
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,541
Don't leave me!

217
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,913
Let go of me, hurry up!

218
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,986
No! I won't.

219
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,679
I'll kick you away, I swear!

220
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,312
No!

221
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,685
Get lost!

222
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,126
Don't leave me...

223
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,785
I'll die in front of you!
I'm going to die!

224
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,954
Don't! Calm down!

225
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,326
Get lost! Leave me alone!

226
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,660
Pal, don't suicide.

227
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,258
She brushed me off!

228
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,952
Since my affair is over.

229
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,885
I'd try very hard
and get success in my career.

230
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,547
I want to be a successful man.

231
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,952
I'll try very hard.

232
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,459
Work very hard.

233
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:49,000
I scare nothing.

234
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:53,035
I want to be a successful...

235
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,296
Teacher!

236
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,103
None of your business!

237
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,710
Are you the new teacher?

238
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,049
What's up?

239
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,841
Are you the teacher of his school?

240
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:06,847
I suppose to be!

241
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,851
That's great!

242
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,979
I'm new!

243
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,523
If anything wrong in the past.

244
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,489
Don't blame me!

245
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,752
That's really great!

246
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,423
I don't know how to fix it!
Please help me.

247
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,997
That's no big deal!

248
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,199
Thank you!

249
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,595
I'm new too!

250
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,297
Have you gone to a wrong place?

251
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,433
No! Am I like a teacher?

252
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,268
Yes!

253
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,812
The gov't sent us here.

254
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,246
I've my triad record clean.

255
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,441
I join the society
by the help of the gov't.

256
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,813
To work in some decent field!
Education, that's it.

257
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,782
We are ordinary citizens!

258
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,086
Yeah...

259
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,020
Which subject will you teach!

260
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,826
Look at me, I'm smart in...

261
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,491
Negotiation, oh, no.

262
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,895
I teach legal education, EPA.

263
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,534
I can't even stand
a mosquito in front of me.

264
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,631
That means,

265
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,973
I can't stand any bad student.

266
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,444
In my school.

267
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,781
Since you 2 join as teachers.

268
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,216
You're the responsibility
to fix the school discipline.

269
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,884
No problem.

270
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,252
If any of them doesn't follow
our instruction.

271
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,024
I'll beat that damn bastard.

272
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,116
Frame the damn boys and.

273
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,456
Rape the dame students.

274
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,161
Is that right?

275
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,992
Mr. Chan,

276
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,329
would you use civilized terms?

277
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:34,498
Well, if they don't follow
our instruction.

278
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,337
Let's use a bag to tie them in.

279
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,571
Teach them good lesson
with baseball bat.

280
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,815
And then, frame him, lastly.

281
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,578
We'd in order, one by one.

282
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,414
Have intercourse with them, please!

283
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,084
As it civilized enough?

284
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,953
But, in our school!

285
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,683
No one is bad student.

286
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,853
But all are bad students.

287
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,962
They are all rubbish.

288
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,666
All rotten students
are gathered here.

289
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,432
Two new teachers are here.

290
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,367
Let's enjoy another war.

291
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,666
Great!

292
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,003
Get ready!

293
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,537
In this semester,
a fierce war is going to start.

294
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,671
Listened?

295
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,077
What's the matter?

296
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,013
Damn...

297
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,312
I'm deal!

298
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,780
What did he say?

299
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,246
Why do you take an umbrella
in such sunny day?

300
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,515
This is a bridge between
the students and teachers.

301
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,422
What's is it?

302
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,024
You use the umbrella as bridge
to cross the river.

303
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,563
When you walk out,
take your umbrella, turn right here.

304
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,865
Jump after 3 steps.

305
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,210
Bend down now!

306
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,045
Why don't you warm me before hand?

307
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,983
You'll remember very well now, right?

308
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,017
You'd pay more attention.

309
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,422
Especially a boy called Ace.

310
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,060
He broke many regulations of school.

311
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,165
If he breaks any regulation,
I can kick him out.

312
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,566
When you have the roll call,
pay attention to him.

313
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,169
If he is late, we can kick him out.

314
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,541
Why Ace hasn't shown up yet?

315
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,241
We heard that Ace will be
kicked out even he's late.

316
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,151
Let's put him in deep shit!

317
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,622
Chase after him.
Okay!

318
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,572
You go there to block his way.
Yes!

319
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,399
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

320
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,568
Roll call now, AL...

321
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,999
Alex!

322
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,202
Present!

323
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,468
Ace, your school bag.

324
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,512
Thank you!

325
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,947
Let's clap to welcome our new teacher.

326
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,650
Welcome...

327
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,489
Are you Alex?

328
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,364
Yes, everyone calls me Ace.

329
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,161
This is my 1st day here.

330
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,637
My name is Hou Shui Ken.

331
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,035
Don't be cheated by my outlook,
which is.

332
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,266
Cheerful, always with smile.

333
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,606
My nature is so cruel that.

334
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,179
I'll throw anyone who wants
to mess up out this classroom.

335
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,646
I want him hold a chair with his leg,
with a table on his back.

336
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,945
Stand out of the window.

337
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,816
Until the classes are over.

338
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,684
I won't give any mercy, understand?

339
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,616
Who dare to play single with me
means a group suicide.

340
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,058
Understand?

341
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,559
Hope I didn't scare you.

342
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:41,428
Literature class now,
turn to page 42.

343
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,899
This an article written by Hung Ming.

344
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:53,217
He is also called Chu Guo Leung.

345
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,547
Where are they?

346
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,925
Headmaster...

347
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:01,685
What's up?

348
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,691
I've lost.

349
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,385
Wallet?

350
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,258
Every new teachers
lose their wallets.

351
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,956
In the ladies toilet,
you can't find it here.

352
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,555
No! I haven't lost my wallet.

353
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,998
Any new trick?

354
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,660
But my students!

355
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,503
Hurry up!

356
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,436
You mean they disappeared?

357
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,569
They did disappear!

358
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,704
Be frank!

359
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,544
Tell headmaster!

360
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,480
Shut up, Ace, tell frankly.

361
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,486
Get up and tell.

362
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,056
He wrote something on the blackboard
and he left.

363
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,319
"I've dated Amy Yip on Monday,
and Frankie Chan on Tuesday."

364
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,418
"Undress on Wednesday,
touch her thigh on Thursday".

365
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,426
"Visit Mary's home on Friday,
I've no sex impulse on Saturday".

366
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,691
"But masturbate on Sunday".

367
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,994
What's your explanation?

368
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,398
None of my business.
I don't mean the content.

369
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,630
But you'd not teach English
in a Chinese class.

370
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,896
Don't do that again.

371
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,341
Be calm, we are here.

372
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,586
Where have you gone just then?

373
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,291
If we can stay in peace in future.

374
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,120
We'll never escape again,

375
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,454
what do you think?

376
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,290
Can I choose?

377
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,822
To express our sincerity,

378
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,627
we class A
will not fool you in 3 days.

379
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,668
But classes B C D E F are dangerous.

380
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,100
We can't help you.

381
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,732
Dangerous?

382
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,935
Good morning sir.

383
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,451
Morning!

384
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:55,603
My name is Hou Shui...

385
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,537
Hou Shui Ken.

386
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,920
What's wrong with him?

387
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,760
He maybe mad!

388
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,328
Don't you know bus is always full!

389
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,407
You'd bring your own seat
in case there is any, stupid.

390
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,702
Let's go, he's mad!

391
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,376
Good-bye Sir!

392
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,203
I suffered enough!
I won't be merciful!

393
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,543
This is the naughtiest class,
class H.

394
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,217
I've heard that the most shameless
and cheapest student here.

395
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,878
Is Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Come out.

396
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,492
I don't mean you 2.

397
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,924
Sit down!

398
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,586
I'm Arnold.
I'm Schwar.

399
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:25,958
I'm Zeneggar.

400
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,029
We are Arnold Schwarzeneggar.

401
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,598
No more bad behavior from now on.

402
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:36,296
Or you'll have so miserable ending.

403
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,621
It's so seriously hurt!

404
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,287
Am I seriously hurt? Yes or no.

405
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,193
Your glasses are seriously hurt,
not you.

406
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,731
I think I can use some eder
or copper 3.

407
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,767
Mix it and fix it,

408
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,236
and use silicon copper cleaner
to clean it.

409
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,737
Am I hurt? Serious or not?

410
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,139
I only know how to repair things,
I don't know how to repair man.

411
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,840
Are you okay?

412
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,274
You're strong life!

413
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,644
I'm Hou Shui Ken.

414
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,152
I'm Lam Moon-Shang.

415
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,555
I'm a Chemistry Teacher.

416
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,415
Moon-Shang!?

417
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,686
You can call me Dreamy,
I'm a P.E. Teacher.

418
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,993
I'm a Chemistry teacher.

419
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,595
I'm a full-subject teacher.

420
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,200
I'm a Chemistry teacher, I mean it.

421
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,429
The students said I've poor memory,
actually it's rumor.

422
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,200
I know you are Miss Hou,
you are Mr. Lam.

423
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,601
Don't you think I've sound memory?

424
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,902
What's your name?

425
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,610
My name...

426
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,140
Look at the I.D. First.

427
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,542
Where is my I.D. Card?

428
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,288
I guess I've forgot to apply
after I've lost.

429
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,117
Go and ask the student's your name.

430
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,227
Which class I'm teaching?

431
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,154
I have sound memory, you're Hou.

432
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,959
You are Lam, I've to ask someone now.

433
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,829
I'm a Chemistry, teacher.

434
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,169
How can he be a teacher?

435
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,503
This is a funny school!

436
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,543
How do you hurt?

437
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,276
I was fainted being thrown
by the student's school bag.

438
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,613
The students are naughty but...

439
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,652
They have good hearts.

440
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,221
Their native is cruel.

441
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,984
Teach them with love! We've the
responsibility to teach them.

442
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,223
I've bought you coke, Miss Lam.

443
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,458
Why not you take it?

444
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,860
I've walked a long way to buy it.

445
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,064
If you are thirsty,
go and buy yourself.

446
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,465
Okay, you drink it.

447
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,506
You must be thirsty, go and buy one.

448
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,738
I'm not! Why should I buy one?

449
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,110
If you're bleeding,
do you still feel thirsty?

450
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,447
Tell me, thirsty or not?

451
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,710
Mr. Chan Wai Ha.

452
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,409
Sir!

453
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,546
Mr. Hou is hurt,
you better substitute his class.

454
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,385
Me?

455
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,887
This is a Mathematics class.

456
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,457
I saw her first, don't court her,
she's mine.

457
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,161
Have a rest!

458
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,999
Do you understand?

459
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,971
No?

460
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,947
You are all creepers!

461
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:10,084
I had a quarrel with somebody once.

462
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,083
We wanted to fight,
we take out our weapons.

463
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,790
I killed 3 up there,
and 3 down there.

464
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,222
They burnt my club.

465
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,464
I burnt his karaoke.

466
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:30,202
Eventually, I destroyed this gang.

467
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,843
We were almost to fight,

468
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,706
but were all arrested.

469
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:39,749
Just few of us escaped
and had a duel.

470
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,920
Eventually, one was stayed alive.

471
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,044
Who is that guy?

472
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,885
I'm the one! Understand?

473
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:49,816
Bravo!

474
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,628
Thank you!

475
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,858
I'm here to substitute you.

476
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,896
Dear classmates,
he is your real head.

477
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,500
They are difficult to handle,
take you turn.

478
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,471
You'd pay me personally
if I substitute you again.

479
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,011
Okay!

480
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,671
See you!

481
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:15,618
My name is Hou Shui Ken.

482
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,846
I want to be growth and
learn together with you.

483
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,582
Here are some soft drinks,
have your time.

484
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,061
If you have any complaints, tell me.

485
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,127
Thank you!

486
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,059
You are welcome!

487
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,860
Thank you!

488
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,894
My pleasure.

489
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:33,935
Thank you sir!

490
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,471
Are you sick?

491
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,675
Nothing special, go on!

492
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:38,807
How are you?

493
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,137
I want to go to toilet.

494
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,609
Let me bring you to the medical room.

495
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,540
How are you?

496
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,451
Let me have a look.

497
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,518
Face me!

498
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,156
I've caught a cold.

499
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,593
Your hair finds a cockroach!

500
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,716
Cockroach?

501
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,222
Are you Kwan Tak Hing?

502
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,831
No, I'm Ng Siu Yuen.

503
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,626
You are Kwan Tak Ming!
Why you pretend as student?

504
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,699
I'm not!

505
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,393
You are!
I'm not!

506
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,367
You are Kwan Tak Hing!

507
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,267
No!

508
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,496
How dare you deny?
I'm not!

509
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,368
Why do you deny?

510
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,202
I'm not!

511
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,505
Why do you follow me?

512
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,841
Admit you are Kwan Tak Hing.

513
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,548
My name is Ng Sin Yuan.

514
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:19,650
Are you?

515
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,686
If you want to change my name,
ask my dad first.

516
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,248
3.

517
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,481
Dad!

518
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,888
Come and help...

519
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,087
Mr. Hou said my name is Kwan.

520
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,864
Are you her dad?

521
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,697
Yes I am!

522
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,068
I'm sure you are not!

523
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,467
How do you know that?

524
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,571
I'm her dad! We are alike!

525
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,010
Are you the informer Blackie Tai?

526
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,812
Yes... No...

527
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,521
Have some fishball, okay?

528
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,592
You are student, you are workman?

529
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,627
Yeah!

530
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,195
Come out...

531
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,103
I'll shout for help
if you don't let me go.

532
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,536
1, 2, 3.

533
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,937
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

534
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,778
Mr. Lam.

535
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,851
What are you doing?
The man's toilet is over there.

536
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,515
I want to check the spelling
of the sign board.

537
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,100
Let's discuss it after school.

538
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,159
What are you starring?

539
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,567
Have you ever seen people smoking?

540
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,502
Never!

541
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,400
Never seen one smoked so secretly.

542
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,537
What are you talking about?

543
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,647
Are you new comer?

544
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,414
Don't he that cocky
when facing your big sister.

545
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,252
Are you big sister?

546
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,519
Didn't anyone tell you
when you paid the school fee?

547
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,594
I'm here to learn, but not,

548
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,256
to meet my sister or something.

549
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,599
Bitch!

550
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,767
Don't fight with me!

551
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,166
Why don't you salute to me?

552
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,900
Donate your money to me.

553
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,339
I'll kick you to the wall.

554
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,167
Cocky as you... Beat her.

555
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,951
Don't!

556
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,961
Anybody else?

557
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,110
How is it? Big sister?

558
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,711
I am the 2nd now.

559
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,345
Who is the eldest?

560
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,239
Sure you are.

561
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,183
Alright.

562
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,634
Sop that please.

563
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,034
You don't like it?

564
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,405
You don't like it either?

565
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,850
Blackie Tai!
What's up?

566
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,319
Stop pretending,

567
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,982
I'm the student of
the Super Scissors Legs.

568
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,488
If you don't tell me the truth.
I'll...

569
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:49,491
Don't!

570
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:50,754
Don't lie to me!

571
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,853
You can't burst my head
with your finger.

572
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,530
Are you sure?
No!

573
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,122
I stab...

574
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,061
Are you crazy?
You can't hurt me in this way.

575
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,738
Is Kwan Tak Hing your daughter?

576
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,669
No!

577
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,036
Are you informer Blackie Tai?

578
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,871
Yes... No!

579
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,638
I'm the dog of the aunt
of the God mother.

580
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,647
Of the admirer of the cousin
of the Queen's son.

581
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,783

582
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,443

583
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,178
Dog eats bone.

584
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,185
You lazy bone!

585
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,483
I'm the inspector of
RHKP Hou Shui Ken.

586
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,880
Me too.

587
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,290
Black Tat, informer of RHKP.

588
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,588
Why don't you
tell me the truth just now?

589
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,057
You didn't tell the code.

590
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,629
Now, you are my informer.

591
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,529
Tell me why Kwan is your daughter?

592
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,132
Because I'm her informer too.

593
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,260
So you are under us?

594
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,701
I can't help! Commissioner
send you as under-cover.

595
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,604
Spider woman sends her
as under-cover.

596
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,675
You both want to achieve something,
then I'll be shit.

597
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,745
Pai, it's the gas pipe!
Don't mess up!

598
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,443
No wonder Hing brushed me off.

599
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,776
I'll go and talk to her now.

600
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,315
She is living with me!

601
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:47,908
I'll move in.

602
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:48,781
No way!

603
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,714
Why?

604
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,755
Who do you think I am?

605
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,389
Okay, move in as soon as possible.

606
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,550
No, he can't live here.

607
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,424
He is my informer,
the gov't pays him.

608
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,791
So I've to live here.

609
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,628
You identity now is my dad.

610
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,199
How can you let him move in?

611
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,462
Now you are my mom,

612
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,128
how can you let his bitch here?

613
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,637
No problem,
one is wolf, one is bitch.

614
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,209
Perfect couple!

615
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,645
I don't care,
if he stays here tomorrow.

616
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,111
I'll use suitable force...

617
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,375
What do you mean...

618
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,780
We are working for our own boss,

619
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,781
call me Inspector Kwan.

620
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,911
PC Hou Shui Ken!

621
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,252
Why do you look at the wine?

622
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,328
I try to quit it,
his will satisfy my need.

623
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,623
I'll be natural high
if a stare at it.

624
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,597
If I can smell it,

625
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,599
I'll be drunken, at once!

626
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,031
Really?

627
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,599
It's expensive! Don't stare so much!

628
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,364
I want to-get drunk
to cure my sorrow.

629
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,171
Do you really love her?

630
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,745
Why do you ask in such a direct way?

631
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,972
My wife is even more fierce than her.

632
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,448
But I can melt her with one stance.

633
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,347
Which one?

634
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,849
I'll embrace her, and kiss her.

635
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,286
Kiss her all over and melt her.

636
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,223
On the next morning,
she is so happy to see me.

637
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,554
Does it really work?

638
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,288
Sure! Come on!

639
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,196
Inspector Chow Sing Sing
used this thing.

640
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,892
To court his better hall.

641
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,297
Make good use of it,
she is a good girl.

642
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,132
Really?

643
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,136
You mouth stink?

644
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,806
You'd not use it in this way?

645
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,441
Poor sex knowledge!

646
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,175
She hits me!

647
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,771
She like torture?

648
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,142
I'll take you my whip, Walt!

649
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,621
To noisy!

650
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,207
I can't live without you.

651
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,208
I don't know how to live
if I lose you.

652
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:08,541
I want to stay with.

653
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,871
This one!

654
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,211
I told you smell it only.

655
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,418
You deserve it!

656
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,783
Have a bowl of congee.

657
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,521
Do you want salted egg?

658
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:48,790
Okay!

659
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,420
Why do you pull it
inside the salt bottle?

660
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,659
So it is salty! Come on!

661
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,297
Do you want bad smell bean cube?

662
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,667
I love that!

663
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,841
Why do you put in inside your shoe?

664
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,244
So it'll create bad smell.

665
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,543
Come on!

666
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,845
I've got preserved bean cube?

667
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,147
Preserved bean cube?

668
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:17,982
Yes!

669
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,454
What are you doing?

670
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,490
According to your theory,
you may put it here.

671
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,424
You are crazy!

672
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,022
Eat your congee!

673
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,127
Where is Hing?

674
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,425
She went to school early
in the morning.

675
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,827
Do you feel lonely? Siu Yuen.

676
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,864
Why not go to shopping? Disco?

677
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,669
My house is big...

678
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,606
Forget these bad eggs.

679
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,871
Come to my home tonight.

680
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,412
Let's have revision together.

681
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,406
You are the...

682
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,710
Worse of all!

683
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,184
I'm kidding!

684
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,116
Beat him!

685
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,324
She seems to be Ng Siu Yuen
of F.5 she is pretty.

686
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,490
And is welcomed by boys.

687
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,431
Bitchy! What a world!

688
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,230
It's no big deal!

689
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,565
Miss Lam, Mr. Hou!

690
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,367
She is courting teenagers.

691
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,873
She is teenager too,

692
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,169
puppy love is so simple.

693
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,836
Be open minded.

694
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,711
I am!

695
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,124
Stay out of my way.

696
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,326
No!

697
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,558
No birthmark!

698
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,293
Big sister!
How is it?

699
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,095
Nothing is discovered.

700
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,230
Who else will be our target?

701
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,210
Do you still want to challenge?

702
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,142
Sure!

703
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,372
Bye!

704
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:04,890
How is it?

705
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:05,962
He is coming.

706
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:09,923
Hey, Ace.

707
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,411
What?

708
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,981
Topless.

709
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,352
The target goes down!

710
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,186
Any birthmark?

711
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,224
No.

712
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,624
Get away, I'll check myself.

713
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,994
Who is Doggie then?

714
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,040
Tell sister now.

715
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,577
Big brother, what'll we do?

716
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:58,805
They've all gone.

717
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,045
Please give back my underwear.

718
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,347
Wash it frequently!

719
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,513
Ng Shi Yuen.

720
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,887
Miss Lam.

721
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,663
Mr. Hou said your skirt is too short.

722
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,665
Make it longer, okay?

723
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:17,563
Yes!

724
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,697
Who do you think you're?
Amy Yip or Yip Yuk Hing?

725
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,034
They are taking your advantage.

726
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,733
In order to get clue, we'd scarify.

727
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,538
But no sex sacrifice.

728
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,937
We've departed! You'd not bother me.

729
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,145
So, let's search our own affair.

730
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,475
That's sound great.

731
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,252
Miss Lam, I've 2 concert tickets.

732
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,416
Let's go tonight.

733
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,255
It's not good if the students see it.

734
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,060
It's you who asked me
to be open minded.

735
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,130
Do you like concert?

736
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,237
I have no tickets at all.

737
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,749
Who is it?

738
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,520
Who is it?

739
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,759
Who is it...

740
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,100
I've twisted my neck.

741
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,328
Why are you so seared?

742
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,336
Of course!

743
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,066
There is wolf of ass.

744
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,665
Almost every men is undressed
by them to have ass checked.

745
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,435
Are you scared?

746
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,104
Sure, I've a pure ass.

747
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,714
This is done by Hing and the girls.

748
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:40,875
They went to search for Doggie.

749
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,519
Don't touch me!

750
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,247
That's line.

751
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,515
But I mind it.

752
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,419
My poor girlfriend,
she sees different asses a day.

753
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,086
With different shapes,
round, square...

754
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,131
There is hair in between the flesh.

755
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,633
Maybe, there are plies.

756
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,836
With pus coming out.

757
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,237
That maybe yellow.

758
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,307
Don't keep the stuff
inside the stomach.

759
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,534
Vomit it!

760
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,112
I agree!

761
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,444
Sorry... l'm sorry!

762
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,210
Mr. Hou.

763
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,152
Miss Lam...

764
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,315
You'd help me this time.

765
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,584
Sure, Mr. Hou will do it.

766
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,158
And you, maybe
you'd scarily a little bit.

767
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,590
You can do it.

768
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,666
No way...

769
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,235
My tape for sex education is damaged.

770
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,827
So I'd like you 2 to demonstrate it,
okay?

771
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,907
Sex education? Okay?

772
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,767
Make up is needed.

773
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,742
No problem.

774
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,477
We've Mr.,

775
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,116
Hou to demonstrate to us.

776
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,318
Welcome, Mr. Hou.

777
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,483
Mr. Hou, come this way please.

778
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,761
When a boy is 13-14.

779
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,198
His sperms
are started to be produced.

780
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,629
The quantity is over billion.

781
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,529
They do this to prepare
for the next generation.

782
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,468
The shape of each sperm,

783
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:16,034
is like Mr. Hou now, with a tail.

784
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,610
The sperms can do
one thing in its life.

785
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,706
Swimming!

786
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,913
It wish to swim towards
the female organ.

787
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,080
Search the egg.

788
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,793
I swim...

789
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:42,037
A normal girl will produce,

790
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:46,132
one egg after each period.

791
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,678
That's it.

792
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,810
Billions of sperms swim
to their target.

793
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,911
They'll surround this egg.

794
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,920
I want to enter you.

795
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,323
Inspector, I'm sorry...

796
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,759
The Headmaster is out...

797
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,490
Maybe we'll arrange some time
for your visit, okay.

798
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,358
I love sudden Inspection.

799
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,797
The arranged Inspection
can show nothing.

800
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,098
When he 1st sperm swim near the egg.

801
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,273
The egg will spread its hair.

802
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,534
I want you.

803
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:19,631
Okay!

804
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,940
It's worth swimming so hardly!
Let's go!

805
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,139
When the sperm entered the egg.

806
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,149
It becomes a fertilized the egg.

807
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,152
A baby will be born after 40 weeks.

808
00:46:58,882 --> 00:46:59,849
Hello!

809
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,885
The education Inspector
wants to ask what they are doing.

810
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,054
They are assisting me
to demonstrate sex education.

811
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,190
How can you do that?

812
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,461
I... You're too much!

813
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,199
Those kind should be scolded!

814
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,435
Once more!

815
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,149
See, you just benefit the others!

816
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,823
Luckily, I can control myself.

817
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,714
Hue Chi?

818
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,585
Our boss Mr. It wants to see you.

819
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,567
Doggie, long time no see.

820
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,869
How are you?

821
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,553
Ti Po Sham Martial Arts?

822
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,368
I haven't wasted my practice
all these years.

823
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,708
Bastard, you'd blame the God.

824
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:21,490
How dare you be the witness
to sue against me?

825
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,594
You can't go!

826
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,792
My statement is sufficient
enough to put you behind bars.

827
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,998
I've checked completely.

828
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,937
The haven't got the document
from your son yet.

829
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,805
I'll go H.K.
And kill your son tomorrow.

830
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,805
Then you'll meet your wife
and son in hell.

831
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,916
Madam, where is my uncle?

832
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,016
He is in the hospital.

833
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,948
Why?

834
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:51,918
Being too excited.

835
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:52,852
My God.

836
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:53,684
He's got a letter.

837
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,620
What is it?

838
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,953
Recommendation for
his early retirement.

839
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,128
From now on, I'm the in-charge.

840
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,161
Madam Chu...

841
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,696
Commissioner!

842
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,490
I'm busy,

843
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,930
I went to tell you a good news
and a bad one.

844
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,230
Tell me the good ones first.

845
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,037
You're done nothing after being
under-cover.

846
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,408
Now, you are dismissed
from this dangerous job.

847
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,267
Go to the Anti-vice Section now.

848
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,705
They want a wolf to trop the whores.

849
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,538
But I am busy!

850
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:22,209
Your job will be pasted
to Kwan Tak Hing.

851
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,013
Yes Madam!

852
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,984
Assisted by Blackie Tai.

853
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:24,849
Yes Madam!

854
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,048
Don't step in the school,
this is and order.

855
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,386
Doggie's dad is killed by the no.
One killer of Taiwan.

856
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,623
It Chun Tung.

857
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:38,992
I've got a clue that he is coming
to Hong Kong to kill Doggie.

858
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,626
You'd try harder to investigate.

859
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:41,897
Yes madam!

860
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,540
Madam, what's the bad news?

861
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,508
The nut, Mad Ball
whom is caught by you last month.

862
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,044
Has escaped from the hospital.

863
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,941
He wrote 14 words on the wall
before escape.

864
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,580
"I want to play
with that 4-eyes frog."

865
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,951
How about the rest?

866
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,813
The rest are lout language!

867
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,988
Are you 4-eyes frog? Take care.

868
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,257
Out!

869
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,460
Order a cup of tea and
toast before you are out.

870
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,630
You don't deserve it! Stupid!

871
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,794
I tell you, I quit now.

872
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,337
I won't give up me job
in St. Yok Keung School.

873
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,066
My identity is a teacher now.

874
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,366
I want to be a teacher.

875
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,373
So what?

876
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,303
Mr. Hou!

877
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,536
What are you doing?

878
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,143
Don't be that narrow minded!

879
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,708
I know you are suffering!

880
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:27,913
Do you treat me as friend?

881
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:28,677
Yes!

882
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:30,377
Friends should help each other.

883
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:31,454
You know?
Yes!

884
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,352
Lend me $3,000 for a whore okay?

885
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,485
Why do you hit me? Who are you?

886
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:15,397
He is our boss, Brother On.

887
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,630
Read my face carefully!

888
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,772
I'll beat you not only once.

889
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,865
I want you to come to the school
gate after school.

890
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,343
Kowtou to my brothers.

891
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,970
And join us.

892
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,115
If you don't.
I'll beat you whenever I see you.

893
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,636
You feel bored, don't you?

894
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,972
Ace hasn't attend school,
he hasn't apply for leave.

895
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,545
He must be late.

896
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:05,976
He has no more excuse!

897
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,347
He'd be kicked out of school.

898
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:09,715
Would that be any accident?

899
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,217
Never, please!

900
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,448
I hope he'd be kicked out,
that's okay!

901
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,522
I suggest, ask him to join our triad,
that's it.

902
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,751
Shut you mouth okay?

903
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:21,759
Headmaster, it's not fair
to treat Ace like that.

904
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,223
He is a small kid only.

905
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,761
You'd not talk like that.

906
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,494
We've our regulations.

907
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,197
Our head doesn't like him,

908
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,036
so he's be punished.

909
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,207
Super finger.

910
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,540
Do you want
to bend your finger again?

911
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:39,749
Headmaster...

912
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:40,780
How are you?

913
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:41,714
Stomach ache!

914
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:45,254
You are actually hurt by my finger.

915
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,489
Headmaster, give Ace one more chance.

916
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,685
At least you'd check the reason
of his late.

917
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:51,586
Once, okay?

918
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:52,821
Mr. Hou!

919
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:55,488
What's up?

920
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,566
What happened to Ace?

921
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,469
He fainted in front of the gate,
I picked him in.

922
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,504
You can tell immediately that
he was beaten.

923
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,008
I was beaten by Amold's boss.

924
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,538
I've told you to study only.

925
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,138
You'd not have been beaten
if you didn't go with the triads.

926
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,947
Ask his parents here
to stop his studentship.

927
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:19,514
I am orphan! My mom's dead.

928
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,618
There are many triad members
in this school.

929
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,557
He is a victim,
you'd not kick him out.

930
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,629
I'd set an example,
so as to remind the students.

931
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,321
Yes!

932
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,330
If I can amend
the behavior of the students.

933
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,127
Make them all be A grade students
in academic and conduct too.

934
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,292
So would you keep him here?

935
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:33,926
Your point is really good.

936
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:36,301
But don't be big month!

937
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,998
If I can not be successful.

938
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:39,640
I'll resign!

939
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,776
I'm on Mr. Hou's side.

940
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:46,609
I'm on your side, but in this case,

941
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,443
I can't help you.

942
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,549
I'll go to your side, Miss Lam.

943
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,257
We support you.

944
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,818
Okay, I'll give you one month.

945
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,590
If anyone of them can't get A grade.

946
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,166
I'll kick him out too.

947
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,127
Bravo!

948
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,002
Mr. Hou, you'd not have
treated me so good.

949
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,176
You are my student, I'll help you.

950
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,911
I'm afraid I can't live
though this evening.

951
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,411
Why?

952
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,553
On asked to stay behind after school.

953
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,487
He wants me to apologize to Arnold.

954
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,116
What? He is too cocky!

955
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,789
Don't worry, I'm here to help you.

956
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,897
I'll ask my boys to chop them.

957
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,967
You are not triad members now!

958
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,237
Yeah, what's I do?

959
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:42,697
I'll fix it!

960
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,102
You are no longer cop now,
don't be mad.

961
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,849
Uncle, I'm in the school now.

962
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,584
I'm down-graded,
don't mess up, okay?

963
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,279
I won't give up!

964
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,754
I want you to help me.

965
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,703
Boss, he asked a gang here.

966
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,884
Ace, what a good boy!

967
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:33,055
You brought so many brothers
to join my triad.

968
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,021
Kneel down and Kowtou to me now.

969
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,316
Each should pay me $3,333.

970
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,558
Are you talking to us?
Who do you think you are?

971
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,163
Turtle, mom is here.

972
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,459
Go home and dine, come on.

973
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,693
Mom, go back yourself,
I've some business to do.

974
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,730
How dare you be that cocky?
Beat his mom!

975
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,970
Don't...

976
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,070
Mom...

977
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:58,544
Don't beat her...

978
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,715
Mom, I dragged you down!

979
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,948
We've done our job.

980
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,753
Mister, don't threaten my boys
with such violence.

981
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,387
This is not legal,

982
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,988
not merciful and stupid.

983
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:20,432
Every society has it's regulation.

984
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:21,694
Do you know what you are talking?

985
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,064
Cantonese.

986
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,770
May I know your name, sir?

987
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,239
I'm 14 On!

988
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,837
Oh, Mr. Fourteen On!

989
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,414
Look at your look, is awful!

990
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,106
But I can see your kind-heart!

991
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,319
Let's settle it in peace.

992
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,914
Who hit me? Who did it?

993
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,079
There is betrayer!

994
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,919
It's me who hit you! All bull shit!

995
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,854
I'm the one responsible
for Ace's case.

996
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,598
If you feel mad,
you can light with me.

997
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,666
I won't give it a damn!

998
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,895
Bravo Mr. Chan.

999
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,604
See! The students
love Mr. Chan more than you.

1000
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:03,642
Thin and short bastard, who are you?

1001
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,107
Question me? I...

1002
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,681
You're left the triad already.

1003
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,542
I come from the YMCA, okay?

1004
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,779
How dare you to cheat me! Beat him!

1005
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:14,647
Teacher and students can fight!

1006
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,723
Who can fight them?

1007
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,122
Uncle!

1008
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,589
What's it?

1009
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,390
Super scissors legs!

1010
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,361
Help!

1011
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,201
If I save you, who'll save me?

1012
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,169
Who is a triad member?

1013
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,742
I am not!

1014
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,875
I'm a small try only!

1015
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,812
He deserves it!

1016
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,311
Ace, melt it!

1017
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,383
Go!

1018
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,820
I've said, teacher and students
can't fight.

1019
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,285
But my friends are different.

1020
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,013
I'll burst your head.

1021
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,224
Don't!

1022
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,985
Apologize or not?

1023
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,386
Okay, I'll apologize.

1024
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:57,390
Brother Ace, I deserve it!
Forgive me.

1025
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,434
Please forgive us, okay?

1026
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:00,601
Get lost now!

1027
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,861
Okay, I'll go!

1028
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,703
Bravo!

1029
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:07,769
I tell you,

1030
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,708
the real triad won't
bully common people.

1031
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:12,110
Only those rascals would
cheat students money.

1032
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,442
You'd know what to do.

1033
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,515
Yes!

1034
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,141
We'd follow you.

1035
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,218
What?

1036
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,383
We are leaving!

1037
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,113
They are the Kung Fu masters
in PC Training School.

1038
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,516
I have to go to my class.

1039
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:22,647
My super finger always fall!

1040
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,589
I know it!
I've recorded it in a tape.

1041
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,694
Listen it when you are free.

1042
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:26,886
See you!

1043
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,623
You'd practice
super finger concentrately.

1044
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,200
Concentrate your air in your abdomen.

1045
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,667
Where is it?

1046
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,838
Under your navel.

1047
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,174
Eyes look at nose, nose looks
at heart, heart looks at penis.

1048
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,276
I can look at my penis with eyes
but not heart.

1049
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:43,512
Don't answer back.

1050
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:48,049
Concentrate your air to the finger,
and point.

1051
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,814
I think you are successful now.

1052
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:20,947
Congratulation!

1053
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,450
But this tape
will explode 15 mins later.

1054
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,551
Leave now!

1055
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:25,778
Are you kidding?

1056
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,155
Damn! I can't open it!

1057
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,782
10... 9
I'm dying!

1058
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,622
8, 7...

1059
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,854
My God!

1060
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,430
6, 5...

1061
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,328
What are you doing?

1062
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,697
Don't go in! It's dangerous!

1063
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,828
Don't block my way! I'm in hurry!

1064
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,738
Explode!

1065
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:51,380
Mr. Chan!

1066
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,948
Please help me, I'm painful!

1067
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,545
Why do you wash your face here?

1068
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,126
Damn!

1069
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,844
I don't smoke, don't hit me!

1070
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,107
Are you okay?

1071
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:27,581
Continue!

1072
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,799
Someone cheats!

1073
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,668
Beat him!

1074
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,311
You can't beat in this way!

1075
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:58,537
But he cheats!

1076
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,512
Fist is no use!

1077
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,015
But use this hammer!

1078
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,085
Damn!

1079
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,151
Really?

1080
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:08,047
I dare not cheat again!

1081
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,556
Go to hell!

1082
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,593
Do you dare?

1083
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,960
Thank you!

1084
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,497
Head Master!

1085
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,496
You, this way, and you, that way.

1086
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,589
You, here.

1087
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,108
See you!

1088
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,043
Be careful!
Okay!

1089
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,779
This is your personal tape.

1090
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,185
I made it for you.

1091
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:43,750
But, nothing can be seen.

1092
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,017
You understand?

1093
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,758
I think I'd be rewarded and A.

1094
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:53,627
I've got it! How about you?

1095
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,294
Why not asking them?

1096
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,099
What do you get?

1097
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,137
Ace.

1098
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,073
And you?

1099
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,145
Thank you Headmaster.

1100
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,780
What's it?

1101
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:09,579
Ace.

1102
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,852
Turtle.

1103
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,319
Don't worry!

1104
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:16,118
Headmaster.

1105
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,554
What is it?

1106
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,304
I've got it! How about you?

1107
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,118
I decided
to keep you with our school.

1108
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,779
Thank you!

1109
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:48,883
That's good!

1110
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:54,862
Maybe, there is a chance
to be promoted.

1111
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,327
But you'd go through today.

1112
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,297
Why?

1113
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,059
Today is the last day of this month.

1114
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,398
If no students break
the school regulation.

1115
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,665
This can be effective.

1116
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,668
I can guarantee,

1117
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,469
no bad students in this school now.

1118
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,771
We'd not be afraid of
any mischievous.

1119
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,936
That's perfect.

1120
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,411
Go to classroom now.

1121
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,210
Be smart!

1122
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,916
You are really great!

1123
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,111
I feel successful!

1124
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,947
I've promised to treat you a meal,
why not today?

1125
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,354
I'll cook you a meal.

1126
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:24,391
Okay!

1127
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,987
What are you doing?

1128
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,392
No, let's dine outside.

1129
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:30,965
What are you doing?
Don't you trust me?

1130
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:31,930
No!

1131
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:36,336
I go and buy the soft drink,
do you want it?

1132
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:41,938
Hing...

1133
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,414
Hing...

1134
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,379
Don't let the Headmaster see it,
or I'll be shit.

1135
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,283
Do you agree with my suggestion?

1136
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,553
Good! Where is Mr. Hou?

1137
01:04:58,661 --> 01:04:59,593
He is inside.

1138
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,723
Shit!

1139
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,994
Miss Lam's got good idea.

1140
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:08,732
Really? What's it?

1141
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,272
We'll arrange a party to celebrate
the improvement of the students.

1142
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,032
Do you agree?

1143
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,870
Perfect!

1144
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,511
Miss Lam, you handle this.

1145
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,578
Okay, bye!

1146
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,337
Bye!

1147
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,385
Do you like sun bathing in this way?

1148
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,430
Yes, I'll get tan easily.

1149
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,032
The students are really behaved!

1150
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,533
We need no umbrella.

1151
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,364
Because of your keen leadership.

1152
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,668
What a sunny weather!

1153
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,411
You'd get tan in this way.

1154
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,952
I've told you I could easily get tan.

1155
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,988
This way is sunny tool.

1156
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,192
Try, this tomato fish.

1157
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,228
Okay!

1158
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,493
I think there is too much food.

1159
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:17,695
Eggs are nutrious and delicious!

1160
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:21,103
Those who'd never forget
the past would like this.

1161
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,336
Dad, let's eat now.

1162
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,084
I've it!

1163
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,211
Come on!
I don't like fish.

1164
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,885
Why don't you eat?

1165
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,252
You give me because no one eats.

1166
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,163
What are doing?

1167
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,031
I've skeleton in my throat.

1168
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,162
I'll fetch the vinegar.

1169
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,538
Open your month.

1170
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,646
It's too deep, I can't fetch it.

1171
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,106
Why don't you take it?

1172
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,214
Okay!

1173
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,447
How are you? Are you okay?

1174
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,649
Dad, I'm going
to eat the wontons noodle.

1175
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,087
Hing...

1176
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,092
How about the skeleton?

1177
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,958
Are you okay? That's fine.

1178
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:18,227
Someone is jealous.

1179
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:28,139
You lied to me.

1180
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:28,835
What?

1181
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,878
You love your student.

1182
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:31,604
No.

1183
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:32,840
Stop lying!

1184
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,246
Only woman understands woman.

1185
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,012
I've discovered that
you are fond of me.

1186
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:37,744
What? Really?

1187
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:40,845
Only woman understands man.

1188
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,421
As you say, woman knows everything.

1189
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,928
Don't deny, I know what you think.

1190
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,195
Yes, I've a little bit fond of you.

1191
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,364
I discovered that
you are not a real teacher.

1192
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,994
She isn't a real student.

1193
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,396
Actually, I shouldn't tell you,

1194
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:01,507
but I can trust you.

1195
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:04,941
I was a cop, but now I'm not.

1196
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,809
I hope you can keep
this secret for me.

1197
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,746
Bye!

1198
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,748
Sometimes, you'd choose.

1199
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:17,883
I know.

1200
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,389
He is a honest guy.

1201
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,989
If he know my secret what he thinks.

1202
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:41,948
Dreamy, you are the dream of all men.

1203
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:48,088
But, I always remember the past.

1204
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,428
She looks better.

1205
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:55,991
It's only dreaming.

1206
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,895
I see nothing!

1207
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,367
What's it?

1208
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,196
Nothing happened!

1209
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,499
Nothing happened.

1210
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:14,172
Fried eggs long live

1211
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:15,748
It's yours, Mr. Chan!

1212
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:16,681
Thank you!

1213
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,094
Headmaster,

1214
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:30,188
I know that the party
in the past forbided 4 steps.

1215
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,099
Because those were bad students.

1216
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,635
Tonight, you can dance what you like.

1217
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,706
What a wonderful master!

1218
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:40,400
If anyone goes against you.

1219
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,771
I'll kill him!

1220
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:45,211
I do want to dance with Miss Lam!

1221
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,349
Old wolf!

1222
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,785
This student is totally changed.

1223
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,355
How amazing!

1224
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,060
Get away!

1225
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,431
Four eyes wolf!

1226
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,971
Enjoy your chatting.

1227
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,171
Are you still angry with me?

1228
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,110
What a failure this time!
I can't find Doggie.

1229
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:27,083
But I've found that
I am suitable to be teacher.

1230
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:29,184
So, it's no big deal of
not finding Doggie.

1231
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,089
I wish to get marry.

1232
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,295
With whom?

1233
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,031
Me?

1234
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,861
No I want to marry with an Indian.

1235
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:41,331
Indian?

1236
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:44,704
Boys and girls!
Please keep quiet, please come here.

1237
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:49,907
Now we'll play a game
called arresting the terrorists.

1238
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:54,182
What are you doing?

1239
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:53,572
Sir, what's the matter? Are you...

1240
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,868
Are you hitting me?

1241
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,506
My God Gun!

1242
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:07,587
I just want you to co-operate!

1243
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,018
I want to look for
a boy called Doggie.

1244
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,122
There is a birth mark on his ass.

1245
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,922
Doggie?

1246
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:17,896
Who is the one responsible?

1247
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,433
I'm the headmaster.

1248
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:23,036
Don't hurt my students.

1249
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,031
Okay, I'll hurt you instead.

1250
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,082
Who is the one next to him.

1251
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,154
He is!

1252
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,083
He is!

1253
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,381
Come out!

1254
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,117
Go!

1255
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:51,631
Who is Doggies? Come out!

1256
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,396
I don't knows!

1257
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:56,397
Even you know it, you won't tell!

1258
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,139
You don't want me
to hurt you students?

1259
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,268
No!

1260
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,137
Why do you beat me?

1261
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,840
Oh, it's you?

1262
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:08,940
He is a cop!

1263
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,414
We are cops too!

1264
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,458
Oh, we'd not have to worry then.

1265
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,558
Martial arts master?!

1266
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,401
Ironic Stomach!

1267
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,598
It Bo Sham Martial Arts...

1268
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,038
Don't get mad.

1269
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,371
You too.

1270
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:39,614
It's you!

1271
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,482
We are just this same.

1272
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,175
But, I'm the undercover
of the opposite side.

1273
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:44,676
Good done!

1274
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,344
Miss Lam!

1275
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,226
Kill them first.

1276
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,021
Brother lt,
hand this guy to me, okay?

1277
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,259
I just promised to investigate
but not kill.

1278
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,354
You tricks me!

1279
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,211
Go now! Go!

1280
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,651
What'll we do now?

1281
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:18,549
Go up and have a look first.

1282
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:24,723
How is it?

1283
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:26,687
The lines are cut.

1284
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:28,854
Go now, we'll go out
to call the police.

1285
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,724
No! I can go!

1286
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:34,667
Don't go in, you'll be killed.

1287
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:38,238
It's too dangerous
for me to save you.

1288
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,872
I know you betrayed them for me.

1289
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,341
I appreciated so much!

1290
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,504
But I can't leave my fiancee alone.

1291
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,477
Hope you'll understand me.

1292
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,987
Where is Doggie?

1293
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:31,651
Stupid!

1294
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:57,517
Ace!

1295
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:58,551
Mr. Hou!

1296
01:15:58,654 --> 01:15:59,712
How are you?

1297
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,083
We are fine.

1298
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:02,486
How are they?

1299
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,259
The guy is mad, go now.

1300
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:14,357
I can't leave you behind!

1301
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:16,264
He's coming for me,
none of your business.

1302
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,338
Go!

1303
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,805
It's my business, I'm Doggie.

1304
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,440
That's why you asked me
to show them my ass!

1305
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:24,512
Sorry!

1306
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,614
I don't want to see my dad,
so I hide my identity.

1307
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,116
But I can't imagine
it's really a mess.

1308
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,613
So you needn't hide yourself now.

1309
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,183
You dad is killed.

1310
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,491
Go! I know how to fix him.

1311
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,123
Turtle, help me.

1312
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:46,799
How?

1313
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:47,869
I'll make them
enter the Chemistry tab.

1314
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,535
Now is 8:53,

1315
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,435
7 minutes to 9.

1316
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,200
You press the bell, okay? Remember!

1317
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:55,968
You want to cut the gas tube?

1318
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:58,603
The bell rings,
they'll be killed by explosion.

1319
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,079
How are you? Mr. Hou.

1320
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:01,977
Fortune teller said
I'll have long life, I'll be fine.

1321
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:03,016
Let's go!

1322
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,415
Let's check our watches.
Okay!

1323
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,446
I'll go and help.

1324
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,182
Help Mr. Hou!

1325
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:13,454
I'm here.

1326
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:15,825
I'll be okay!

1327
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,195
Kidding?

1328
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,695
Let's go!

1329
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:49,123
Don't shoot!

1330
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:52,826
Where can you go?

1331
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,337
Super finger! Watch out!

1332
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,404
Don't bend my finger!

1333
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:21,961
Don't! I don't like that!

1334
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,358
We haven't finished
our game last time.

1335
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,733
This time, we play in 5 bullets.

1336
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,578
Why can't you smell the gas?

1337
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,860
I can't help, it's because of you.

1338
01:18:58,934 --> 01:18:59,628
I'm sorry!

1339
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,169
Never mind!
Let's play in 6 this time.

1340
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:03,962
6?

1341
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,015
There is only 10 more seconds
to the explosion.

1342
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:29,526
Time is so limited!

1343
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,301
Chemistry lab...

1344
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:44,207
Which is chemistry lab
and which is Maths room?

1345
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,347
Just 2 seconds left. I've to risk.

1346
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,185
Not this one!

1347
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,887
Let's talk in peace okay?

1348
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,055
This one!

1349
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,168
I made it!

1350
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:20,775
Damn you Mad Ball!

1351
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:22,174
Go to hell!

1352
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,751
Eat shit now!

1353
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,889
You are really great!

1354
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,183
I don't want it actually!

1355
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:33,659
You stupid!

1356
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,127
Uncle Tai!

1357
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:41,363
Where is Hou?

1358
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:42,936
They are in the PE hall.

1359
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:43,970
Call the police!

1360
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,184
What else to you have?

1361
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,420
He knows Ti Bo Sham Martial Arts.

1362
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,892
Attack his heart and throat.

1363
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,972
Attack him together!

1364
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:24,871
American football.

1365
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:35,586
I can't jump that high!

1366
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:37,448
What'll I do now?

1367
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:40,023
Attack his penis!

1368
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,827
Hurry up!

1369
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:55,769
Why that's no use?

1370
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,039
Kidding?

1371
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:07,447
You killed my father.

1372
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,989
You are Doggie?!

1373
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,867
Don't beat him, release him.

1374
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:25,673
Kidding only!

1375
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,763
Damn!

1376
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:32,641
Let's bet our lives!

1377
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,647
Super finger is much
more powerful than scissors legs.

1378
01:22:58,573 --> 01:22:59,369
Turtle.

1379
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:00,304
Yes!

1380
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:25,123
You words would become evidence.

1381
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:25,858
Got it?

1382
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:26,592
Are you okay?

1383
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:28,860
Don't you think I'd be in trouble?

1384
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:30,134
What are you starring?

1385
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:33,902
Come and help! It's heavy!

1386
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,938
Ace, don't just play.

1387
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,208
Study hard I'll miss you.

1388
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,423
See you!

1389
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,286
I want to talk to you.

1390
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,952
But I don't know where to start.

1391
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,029
Go ahead!

1392
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,462
You are too handsome! I love you.

1393
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:59,157
Mr. Hou, in a hurry?!

1394
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:00,700
Come on!

1395
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:03,429
I'll wait!

1396
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:05,302
Madam!

1397
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:07,202
I decided to promote
you as Chief Inspector.

1398
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,400
You can resume duty now.

1399
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,943
Thank you madam.

1400
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,812
But I don't think it suits me.

1401
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,379
What'll suit you then?

1402
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,040
They'll do.

1403
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,642
I want to be teacher.

1404
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:21,483
Because I'll feel successful
if I can make them good.

1405
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,816
Sorry madam!

1406
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:28,889
I'm back!

1407
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:32,797
Bravo! Hurray!

1408
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,802
Your boyfriend is useless,
don't marry him.

1409
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:36,996
Or you'll be in deep shit.

1410
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:37,969
Open the door.

1411
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:39,140
Yes madam!

1412
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:41,336
Wait!

1413
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,908
Madam...

1414
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,151
My uncle has one thing in mind
but he's never done this.

1415
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,081
What's it?

1416
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:52,278
That's...

1417
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,411
How can you milk?
