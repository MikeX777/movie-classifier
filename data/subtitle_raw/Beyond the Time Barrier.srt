1
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Good morning.

2
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,400
- Morning, Colonel.
- Oh, hi, Bill.

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, did you make our
reservations for lunch at the club?

4
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
You and your easy living.

5
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Boy, you better cut down
on some of that weight,

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,400
- or I'm gonna ground you.
- Oh, yeah? Look who's talking.

7
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
You know, Marty,
you're just jealous.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
You're after my job,
and I know it.

9
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
You know, you may be right.

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Okay, hero, let's get you
into your flight suit.

11
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
Right.

12
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,800
The flight is divided
into three phases.

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,200
Ground to maximum altitude,

14
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
maximum speed
and con troll ability

15
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
in the upper, thin air,

16
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
and reentry.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Now, the turbo jet engine
will lose its efficiency

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,000
at around 50,000 feet.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Allison will coast on up
to 75,000 feet,

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
and then cut in
the new rocket engine.

21
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,600
He'll level off at around
500,000 feet,

22
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,400
one hundred miles above
the earth, gentlemen.

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,800
For all practical purposes,

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Major Allison will be in space.

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
Now, at this altitude,

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
he'll lower
the ventral stabilizers

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
and make his high-speed
stability flight,

28
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
progressing from position
one to 20.

29
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
Now, we know the X-80
is capable of a speed

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,600
of 5,000 miles per hour.

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,800
In the thin air
of 100 miles altitude,

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,600
with no resistance, who knows?

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,200
What we learn from this flight

34
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,400
will pretty well determine
our next step into space.

35
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
The satteloid...

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,600
A man in orbit.

37
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
You all set, Major?

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I'll join you

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,400
in Flight Control shortly.

41
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
Hello, tracking
station number two.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is Sands Flight Control.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
X-80 standing by for takeoff.

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
With your
permission, tower.

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Am I clear to roll?

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Weather clear.

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,400
You have a green light.

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,800
Good luck.

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
X-80 to Sands Control.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Approaching altitude
40,000 feet.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Airspeed 1,200,

52
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
angle of flight
85 degrees, over.

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,400
Fifty thousand feet, Colonel.

54
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
Turbo power cutting out.

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Hello, Control,
approaching 75,000 feet.

56
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Cutting in rocket engine.

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
Hello, Sands, this is X-80

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
approaching altitude
400,000 feet.

59
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, Colonel,
there's a new record for you.

60
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,800
Good work, Allison.

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
How do you feel?
How's she handling?

62
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
No, pain, no strain.
Leveling off.

63
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,600
Proceeding with
Phase Number Two, over.

64
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,200
When you're ready, kid.
When you're ready.

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
This is X-80 to Sands Control,

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
approaching Position Number One.

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Altitude 500,000,
airspeed 1,000-plus.

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
Central stabilizers in position.

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
You ready, Colonel?

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Ready any time you are.

71
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
And the Lord be with you, over.

72
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Sands Control from X-80.

73
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Position Number Four.

74
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Airspeed 2,000, 2-0-0-0.

75
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
We're going all the way.

76
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
X-80 to Sands Control,
position Number Eight.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400
Airspeed 6,000, 6-0-0-0.

78
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Position 10, airspeed 7,000.

79
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
No instrument leaks.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
- What is it, Martin?
- I'm not sure.

81
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
We've lost radio contact.

82
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,000
Colonel Martin, he's off
the tracking field!

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,400
Keep trying. Keep trying.

84
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Sands Control to X-80.
Sands Control to X-8-O.

85
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
Come in, X-80.

86
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Sands Control to X-80.

87
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Sands to X-8-O. Come in, X-80.

88
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,800
Reentry glide successful.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
This is X-80 preparing
for a landing.

90
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Are you reading me?
Come in, Sands Control.

91
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Hey! Anybody here?

92
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
Did you make our
reservations for lunch at the club?

93
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
You and your
easy living.

94
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
Boy, you better cut down
on some of that weight,

95
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
or I'm gonna ground you.

96
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Yeah, look
who's talking.

97
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
You know, Marty,
you're just jealous.

98
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
You're after my job,
and I know it.

99
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You know,
you may be right.

100
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
Okay, hero, let's get you
into your flight suit.

101
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Right.

102
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
Where is everybody?

103
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey! Anybody here?

104
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,800
Who are you? Who are you?

105
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,000
What are you doing to me?

106
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
I said what are you doing to me?

107
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Can't you hear me?
Get me out of this thing!

108
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Who... Who are you people?

109
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Where am I, in a hospital
or something?

110
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,000
Where am I?

111
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,200
What's wrong with you?
Can't you understand me?

112
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,400
Say something!

113
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I said answer me! Can't you...

114
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Let go of me!

115
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,400
Oh, I'm... Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

116
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The new prisoner has been
cleansed of radiation,

117
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
my Master.

118
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600
That is well.

119
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Let us hope we find him
more cooperative

120
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,200
than the previous prisoners.

121
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,600
I hope Trirene has learned
something from his thoughts.

122
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
We must be very careful.

123
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
He will use all the known
tricks.

124
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,200
We can depend on that.

125
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
We will proceed with
the usual caution, Captain.

126
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,800
Who are you?

127
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Major William Allison,
US Air Force.

128
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Won't you sit down Major?

129
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Sir, I'd like to ask
some questions.

130
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm very confused
about what's happened to me.

131
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
Yes, of course, Major.

132
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,000
Ask your questions.

133
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
I'd like to know where I am
and how I got here.

134
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,800
And who all you people are.

135
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,400
And the air field...
What has happened to it?

136
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,800
The air base, my Supreme.

137
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,600
Yes, I left there
at 8:00 this morning.

138
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,800
A half hour later,
it was in shambles, deserted.

139
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,200
Where are Colonel Martin
and the others?

140
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,800
I... I don't understand.

141
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,200
You are from a nation
of speaking peoples.

142
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,800
How glorious that must be.

143
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,200
Our society's less fortunate.

144
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,600
Your society?

145
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Yes, you see,

146
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
we here in our citadel,

147
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
save for my captain and myself,

148
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
are deaf-mutes.

149
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Even my own grandchild, Trirene.

150
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
Deaf-mutes?

151
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,600
You mean, everybody?

152
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,800
I don't understand.

153
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,400
There will be time
for understanding,

154
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
if you are cooperative.

155
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Now, tell us of your nation.

156
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir, I'm sorry.

157
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
You know very well
what we're talking about.

158
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,800
You're not the first spy
we've ever captured.

159
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,200
What do you mean, "Spy"?

160
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
I asked some simple questions.
I expect some simple answers.

161
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I want some answers.

162
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
What is this you're wearing?

163
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
This symbol... What is this?

164
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
New devices to deceive us,
my Master.

165
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
We have seen such guises before.

166
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
They do not fool us.

167
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,000
It would be wise to tell us
all you know.

168
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm Major William Allison,
United States Air Force, sir.

169
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,600
Serial number 03564629.

170
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,000
That's all I'm required
to tell you.

171
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,600
I will use other measures,
Supreme.

172
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
I will get to the truth.

173
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
Wait, Captain.

174
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Major, we have saved your life.

175
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,400
You could have been
captured by the mutants.

176
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Won't you cooperate with us?

177
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
With your permission, sir.

178
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
What was your purpose
in coming here?

179
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,400
I don't have any purpose.

180
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
You lie, you were spying on
our solar energy installation.

181
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,800
How did you find us?

182
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Find you? I don't even
know where I am.

183
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,600
You're searching for
Karl Kruse and Dr. Bourman.

184
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,800
You're one of them, aren't you?

185
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
I never heard of them!

186
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
Where are your people living?

187
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,800
Would you really
like to know, Captain?

188
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,600
Yes, of course I want to know!

189
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, at this very minute,
I don't know myself.

190
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Captain...

191
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He's impossible.

192
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
You're one of the scapes.
Admit it.

193
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I'm an officer of
the United States Air Force.

194
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,000
I'd like someone to tell me
something that makes some sense!

195
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Other nations, mutants...
What kind of talk is this?

196
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,800
He is very clever, my Supreme,
but I have a plan.

197
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
I can use him to our advantage.

198
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Trirene does not approve
of your plan, Captain.

199
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,200
She has found some truth
in the major's thoughts.

200
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,400
I do not trust him,
especially his thoughts.

201
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,600
Even Trirene could be deceived.

202
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Follow through with
your plan, Captain.

203
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Yes, Master.

204
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
It will be done.

205
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
Let go of me! Let me go!

206
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
What are you doing?
What are you...

207
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It appears you have more
than the usual interest

208
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
in this young Captain, Trirene.

209
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
He's very young-

210
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,800
This young man is an enemy.

211
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
We must be very careful.

212
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,800
I understand your wish, Trirene.

213
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,200
We see you, Captain!

214
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
We see you up there!

215
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
Captain is alone!

216
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Who are you?

217
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I can't see you!

218
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,600
Good Lord.

219
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,800
What's wrong with you?

220
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,600
We will kill you, Captain!

221
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
Mutants! I'm not the captain,
you understand?

222
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Who are you?

223
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
You can talk! Answer me!

224
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Yes, I... I... I will talk.

225
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
Stay back! I'll break his arm.

226
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Now... The captain and his
people are your enemies.

227
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,200
Why?

228
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,800
They are listening.

229
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,400
They are listening
and watching us!

230
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,800
I don't care,
I want some answers!

231
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
Who are these people
in the citadel?

232
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,800
They are hiding from us!

233
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
They have food.
They have everything!

234
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
But we will find them.

235
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,200
All of them!
And kill, kill, kill them!

236
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,400
Why are they hiding?

237
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
They are infected, too.

238
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
They cannot escape!

239
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Escape? Escape from what?

240
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,200
You are a scape...
Like Karl Kruse.

241
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,600
Who are the scapes?

242
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,000
You... You and Kruse,
you are scapes!

243
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,200
- We know!
- You left us to die.

244
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
You ran from the plague!

245
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,200
What plague, when?

246
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,400
Long ago... Long ago,
you left us here to die.

247
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,000
You did this to us!

248
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
We will find your hiding place

249
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,600
and we will kill all of you!

250
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I did this?

251
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Has the whole world gone mad?

252
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,600
Young man, my granddaughter
has chosen to protect you.

253
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,800
She has expressed faith
in what you've told us.

254
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,200
My captain and I will
trust her judgment.

255
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,400
Trirene has a gift
we do not possess.

256
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
She has an extrasensory power.

257
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
She's able to perceive
every thought

258
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
within our minds.

259
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,000
Go with her, young man.

260
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,800
You will have the freedom
of our citadel.

261
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
And our child will be happy.

262
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Oh, thank you.

263
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,200
Uh... Thank you.

264
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Hey... Am I starved.

265
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
That looks great.

266
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
Uh, thank you.

267
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Uh... Thank you.

268
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Oh, I...

269
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,600
I... I was just looking around.

270
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,200
I mean, uh...

271
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
Trirene, I want to thank you

272
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
for rescuing me.

273
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,800
But, you know, that captain
seems determined

274
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,200
that I'm an enemy.

275
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,800
If you could only talk.

276
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
If I could only
make you understand.

277
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
I... I'll go out of
my mind if I...

278
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
You know what I'm thinking,
don't you?

279
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,800
You know how important
it is for me to find out

280
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
exactly what happened,
and how I got here.

281
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
The City?

282
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
You and all the people here

283
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,200
once lived in this city,
is that right?

284
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
No?

285
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Hmm.

286
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Oh, your grandfather,
the Supreme.

287
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
He lived in the city?

288
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I see.

289
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,600
Your father?

290
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And your mother.

291
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,400
They came here
before you were born?

292
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,600
Then you've never lived in the
air and sunlight, have you?

293
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,000
Trirene, tell me.

294
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,400
Why did they abandon that city

295
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
and move to this
subterranean world?

296
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The mutants?

297
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,400
The plague? Was it the plague
they told me about?

298
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Trirene, try to understand this.

299
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,800
I was on an air field
this morning.

300
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
In less than an hour,
everything had changed.

301
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
All the people I knew were gone.

302
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,400
There was no plague
where I came from.

303
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,600
What happened?

304
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
What happened to your
father and mother?

305
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,600
The mutants killed them?

306
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,400
Oh, I'm...

307
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm very sorry.

308
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,800
You know my thoughts
before I express them, so...

309
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
You know I'm going to ask you
about Karl Kruse.

310
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,400
Is he here in the citadel?

311
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,800
Look, would you take me to him?

312
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
I think if I can
get to Karl Kruse,

313
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,600
he can help me
understand all this.

314
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Trirene gives me to understand

315
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,600
that you are one of us.

316
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
I don't know, I'm not sure.

317
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,000
I think you are.

318
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
How long have you been here
in the citadel?

319
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
Since this morning.

320
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,400
Well, I'm not certain.
I don't know.

321
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,200
I've lost track.

322
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Time has very little meaning
here in the citadel, I fear.

323
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
Trirene informs me
that you have been here

324
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,000
for three turns of the earth.

325
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
That is three days.

326
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
I've only been in this place
a few hours.

327
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,600
I took off from the field
at 0800 this morning.

328
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,400
I had hoped that you'd
be able to explain this...

329
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Do not excite yourself.

330
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,400
We will explain.

331
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
There'll be plenty of time.

332
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Let me introduce myself.

333
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm Karl Kruse.

334
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Used to be General Karl Kruse.

335
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,800
This is Professor Bourman.

336
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
How do you do?

337
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Major William Allison,
United States Air Force.

338
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Did you say United States
Air Force?

339
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,600
Why, yes... What's so
unusual about that?

340
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Major Allison, what year
was your flight in?

341
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,600
I told you, today...
This morning.

342
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
But what day and what year,
Major?

343
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
It is important we know.

344
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,800
March 5, 1960.

345
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
1960?

346
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,800
He's from before the plague.

347
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,400
How is this possible, Professor?

348
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,600
What is this plague
I keep hearing about?

349
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,800
You really don't know, do you?

350
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,000
No, I don't know...
I don't know where I am

351
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,600
or how I got here,
and I don't know

352
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,800
who these people are
in the citadel, either.

353
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,000
Well, Trirene has found herself
a big, good-looking playmate.

354
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
And a fiery one, too.

355
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,000
Major Allison,
this is ex-Captain Markova.

356
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,200
I don't know that I like

357
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,600
what you have on your mind,
Captain.

358
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Maybe when you find out
what she has on hers,

359
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
you'll like that better.

360
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,800
What are you driving at?

361
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,000
They've giving you the run
of this place, haven't they?

362
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yes...

363
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,200
So little Trirene here

364
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
can get busy and...

365
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,000
What kind of female are you?

366
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I had to do it.

367
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,200
Don't you understand?

368
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,400
You mean, she was
reading your thoughts?

369
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,200
Things you didn't
want her to know.

370
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
That's right.

371
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
We can talk now,
but not for long.

372
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,600
The captain will be
up here any minute

373
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,400
to see what's happened
to his gadgets.

374
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Watch out for him.

375
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,200
He rules this place
with an iron fist.

376
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Yes, so I found out.

377
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
He's determined
I'm an enemy spy,

378
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
a, uh, "Scape," he called it.

379
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,800
That's the name
they have given us...

380
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,600
We who escaped
the cosmic plague.

381
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,800
They hate us
for leaving them behind.

382
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Luckily, we convinced them
they needed us.

383
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,200
Otherwise, we'd still be down
in the pit with the mutants.

384
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,200
We keep the solar power system
operating.

385
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,400
All their skilled men
have died off.

386
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,800
Then the mutants are the ones
who did not escape the plague.

387
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,400
- Is that right?
- No, the people here,

388
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
in this citadel, didn't either.

389
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,200
They are all first-stage
mutants themselves.

390
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,000
Is that why
they're deaf and mute?

391
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,600
And sterile.

392
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
Except for Trirene, perhaps.

393
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,400
Sterile?

394
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,800
Yes... They are a dying race.

395
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
There hasn't been a new birth
in this citadel

396
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
for the past 20 years.

397
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That's where you fit
into the plan, Allison.

398
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
Make no mistake about it.

399
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,800
- What do you mean?
- Regeneration.

400
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,200
Trirene has chosen you
as her mate.

401
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
You're the last hope
of this society.

402
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,800
I don't understand it.

403
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,000
There wasn't any plague
this morning.

404
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
When did it happen?

405
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,600
Major Allison, have you any idea

406
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,800
what year this is,
right here, right now?

407
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
Well, of course I know
what year it is.

408
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
What's that got to do with it?

409
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,400
Everything...
Major, this is 2024.

410
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,000
- It's what?
- 2024.

411
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,600
Sixty-four years into
the future for you, Major.

412
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
The plague we are talking
about, it hadn't happened

413
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
in your world in 1960.

414
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
It began in 1971.

415
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
An atomic war?

416
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,800
No, no.

417
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
The feared nuclear war
never occurred.

418
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
When man set foot on the moon,

419
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
all nations started
to work together

420
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,000
to push on into space.

421
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,200
By 1970, colonies had been
established on both Mars

422
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,800
and Venus.

423
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,000
Then, if it wasn't nuclear
war, what did cause it?

424
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,200
A bombardment
of cosmic radiation

425
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,400
from outer space.

426
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,600
Bombardment from outer space?

427
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,800
Oh, now, wait a minute.

428
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
You wait...

429
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,800
Now, listen to me, Allison.

430
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,600
The people of your world
are concerned

431
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,200
about nuclear fallout.

432
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,400
Well, heh, the danger is
in the other extreme.

433
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,000
The tons of radioactive dust

434
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,600
that have mushroomed up
into the ionosphere

435
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
since the very first
A-bomb test.

436
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,800
That dust has remained up there,

437
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,600
and it's slowly destroying
the protective screen

438
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,200
that has filtered deadly
cosmic rays from space

439
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,400
since time began.

440
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
Do you understand, Major?

441
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,600
Yes.

442
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
And all the nuclear explosions

443
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,400
that have ever taken place
on Earth

444
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
have contributed to this.

445
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,600
Yes.

446
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,800
And every human being left
has become mutant...

447
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,200
Or sterile...
Or a combination of both.

448
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
If what you say is true,
then Colonel Martin

449
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
and all the others
were caught up in it.

450
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,000
What's happened to them?

451
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
How can I find out?

452
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,600
There isn't any way.

453
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,000
Let's only hope they were
amongst the lucky ones

454
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,200
who could evacuate.

455
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Evacuate?

456
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,600
Yes.

457
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,800
In 1973, the mass
evacuation began

458
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,600
to the planet colonies.

459
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,400
Only the uninfected ones
were permitted to go.

460
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000
The ones left behind
moved underground

461
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,600
as fast as possible
and started building

462
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
networks of tunnels...
Like this one.

463
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
More than half the population
of the world was wiped out

464
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
during the first year.

465
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
I see.

466
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,800
When I landed on the air base,

467
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
it was completely destroyed,
demolished.

468
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
Deserted.

469
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,400
You landed? You didn't crash?

470
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,200
The captain!

471
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
When they found you,
they destroyed your ship?

472
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
No, no... I left the air base.

473
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,000
They captured me afterwards.

474
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Then your plane is in
operating condition,

475
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,800
sitting out there
on the air base?

476
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,400
Well, I suppose so.

477
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,600
Unless the mutants
have found it.

478
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Well, Kruse, I see you've
become acquainted

479
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
with our new prisoner.

480
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,200
Yes, Captain.

481
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,800
And it is your good fortune,
as well as ours,

482
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,400
Major Allison has an excellent
technical background

483
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,000
and he's eager to help us.

484
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And, as you know, Captain,
we are in dire need

485
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
of skilled help.

486
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Well, we shall see.

487
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,400
Where's Trirene?

488
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,400
I believe she's returned
to her chambers, Captain.

489
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,200
I think she's expecting
a visitor.

490
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,600
Come along with me, Major.

491
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,400
We have some things to discuss.

492
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,400
Kruse, I'm warning you,
I'll tolerate

493
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,000
no more of your scheming.

494
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,400
If you persist, I'll see that
you're back in the dungeon.

495
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
We've got to get to the major
before they convince him

496
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,000
we're his enemies.

497
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,600
But, unfortunately, I do not
understand such things.

498
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,400
I am not a scientist.

499
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
My concern is a military one.

500
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,000
I must save the last
of my people.

501
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Then it is true...
Your society is doomed.

502
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
Major Allison, I must warn you.

503
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,200
Karl Kruse and his group
are shrewd.

504
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
They'll use you... They're
the most dangerous scapes

505
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,000
I've ever encountered.

506
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,600
It would be wise for you
not to associate with them.

507
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,800
Come, I'll show you
your chamber.

508
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Major, I must
tell you the truth.

509
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,400
Understand, it's not an easy
thing for me to do.

510
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,800
What they say about us is true.

511
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,400
We are sick and dying.

512
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,200
You cannot imagine with the
envy that I look upon you,

513
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Kruse, and Dr. Bourman.

514
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
I myself am in the first
stages of mutation.

515
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,600
You?

516
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,800
For this reason, I have no love

517
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
for you who have
escaped the plague,

518
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
but as the Supreme has told you,

519
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
we will trust
in Trirene's judgment.

520
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,800
Major Allison, I ask you,

521
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
do nothing that will
bring harm to her.

522
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
For Trirene is our only hope.

523
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,800
Trirene?

524
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,200
Trirene.

525
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Trirene...

526
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,000
I want to talk to you.

527
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,600
Look, I... I'm very sorry
about the things.

528
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Markova said to you.

529
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,400
I don't believe any of
the things they told me.

530
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
You know I'm telling
the truth, don't you?

531
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,800
You know, you're very lovely.

532
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,000
I keep forgetting
you can read my thoughts.

533
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
I wish you couldn't.

534
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
What can I say?

535
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
You're not angry?

536
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,000
You know, you have an unfair
advantage over every man.

537
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,600
What are you doing here?

538
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,200
Ah, take it easy.

539
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Don't you think I know what'll
happen to me if I'm caught?

540
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,800
You were spying on us.

541
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,600
Don't be foolish...
I couldn't care less.

542
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,200
Come here.

543
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
- I better get back.
- Wait...

544
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Kruse has to see you.
He has a plan.

545
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,800
I don't know whether I'd better
be seeing any of you or not.

546
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,200
We may be able
to get you out of this

547
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,600
and back to your own time.

548
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,800
How can I possibly go back
to my own time

549
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
if I don't know how I got here?

550
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,400
You don't, but Kruse
and Bourman do.

551
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
Look, why should it be me?

552
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,600
Why not Kruse or Bourman?

553
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,400
Or... Even you, Markova?

554
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,600
There'd be nothing to be gained
by returning to our time.

555
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,600
It's different with you.

556
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
You're from before the plague.
You may be able to...

557
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I may be able to prevent it,
is that what you mean?

558
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Of course.

559
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,000
You've got to take this chance.

560
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If you can get back to your
people and prevent the plague,

561
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,200
all this will never happen.

562
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,200
Let's go talk
to Kruse and Bourman.

563
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Come on.

564
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,600
Yes, I agree...
I have to get back

565
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,800
to my time, to 1960.

566
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Oh, we have
a very good chance, Major,

567
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,800
if we can reverse the phenomenon
that brought you here.

568
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,200
What phenomenon
did bring me here?

569
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,600
It is what we know
as a relativity paradox.

570
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,800
It's another dimension,
a fifth dimension.

571
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,400
Fifth dimension?

572
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,800
Professor Bourman's principle
of gravitation propulsion

573
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,400
brought it about.

574
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,200
By 1970, it became
the standard system

575
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,200
used to travel to the planets
at the speed of light.

576
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,600
The speed of light?

577
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,600
I thought 10,000 miles an hour
was fast.

578
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,000
Yes, but there
is a pitfall

579
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,200
in the system.

580
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,800
At speeds approaching
that of light,

581
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,600
it is possible to break
the time lock.

582
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,800
The, um, barrier
that holds all things

583
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,600
in a normal time relationship
to each other.

584
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,400
That's what
happened to all of us.

585
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,600
We have slipped out
of one time sphere

586
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
and into another.

587
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,800
Captain Markova
broke through in 1973

588
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
during her third flight.

589
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,400
She was transporting supply
from Central Europe

590
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,000
to the Venus planet.

591
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,200
The captain's men
destroyed her ship.

592
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,000
It happened to Kruse and I
years later.

593
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,800
We had returned to earth
for an observation flight

594
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,600
in 1994.

595
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,000
Our ship crashed.

596
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,800
1994?

597
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,600
But the speed I approached
in the X-80

598
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
was nowhere near
the speed of light.

599
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,800
That may be.

600
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
But it was just enough

601
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,000
to create certain
mathematical conditions.

602
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,600
Let me show you.

603
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,200
Here, these symbols
represent the earth,

604
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,600
the sun, and your ship.

605
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Now, consider these known facts.

606
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,800
The earth is rotating
at 1,000 miles per hour.

607
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,200
But it is also revolving
in orbit around the sun

608
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,800
at 66,000 miles per hour.

609
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,000
Time as we know it

610
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,200
is relative to these movements.

611
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,600
But the entire solar system,

612
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,000
together with other systems
of our galaxy,

613
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,800
are moving through space at
over six million miles per hour.

614
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
Theoretically,
you had a velocity

615
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,000
approaching the speed of light
before you ever left the ground.

616
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,800
Yes, but everything is moving
at that speed together,

617
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,200
as one unit...
The air, the earth,

618
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
according to the law of gravity.

619
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,200
Time is not affected
by the laws of gravity.

620
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
This is what happened to you.

621
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,400
At some point during
your high-speed flight,

622
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,800
you approached escape velocity,

623
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,200
Twenty-five thousand
miles per hour.

624
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,600
It was at this time that you
altered your flight angle.

625
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,200
If you hadn't, probably you
would have gone on into orbit.

626
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,000
It was this angle at a
specific altitude and velocity

627
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,800
that broke the time barrier.

628
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,600
For a fraction of a second,
you were suspended in space,

629
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,200
no longer interlocked
with the time spheres

630
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,200
of the sun and the earth.

631
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,600
Now, during this split second,
our galaxy moved onward in time

632
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,200
for what amounted to 65 years.

633
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,600
An instant later, you had
rejoined our solar system,

634
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,200
and the rest you know.

635
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Yes.

636
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,600
Then, if I repeat
the altitude, angle of flight,

637
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,800
and speed, in directly
the opposite direction,

638
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,000
I should go back into time
65 years.

639
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
Precisely.

640
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Dr. Bourman is working
on the formula.

641
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,600
The three factors must be exact.

642
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,400
Then we must locate
an escape from the citadel,

643
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
- so I can find my ship.
- Right.

644
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,200
We must obtain an early map
of the citadel

645
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
with the tunnel work.

646
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,600
Your air base surely
must be included.

647
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,800
They began construction
as early as 1972.

648
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
The maps are on file
at the Supreme's chamber.

649
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,400
There is only one way
to get them, Major.

650
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,000
You mean Trirene?

651
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,600
- That's the only way.
- No.

652
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,800
No, I won't turn her
against her own people.

653
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,200
You have to do it.

654
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,400
It's up to you, Major.

655
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,000
You haven't much time
to decide.

656
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,400
Very well...

657
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
I'll do it.

658
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,600
You stay here.

659
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,000
I'll find my way back.

660
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,200
Trirene, I've got
to have your help.

661
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,200
It's very difficult for me
to know what to do,

662
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,200
but there's something...

663
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,200
What would I do without you?

664
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,200
Trirene...

665
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,600
Tell me you know
I'm doing the right thing.

666
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,800
I've got to try and go back.

667
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,000
You do understand that,
don't you?

668
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,800
There won't have to be
any citadel.

669
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,600
You and your people can live
on the surface of the earth

670
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,800
without fear of any
cosmic plague.

671
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,600
They're waiting.

672
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,800
I made this tracing
from the original map.

673
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,600
Then Trirene returned it
to the archives.

674
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
Here, let me show you.

675
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,400
Now... Here's the citadel.

676
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,800
I remember a wooded area
and a hill.

677
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,000
The solar antenna
was atop the hill.

678
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,600
They must have hit me with
that paralyzing ray about here.

679
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,000
This outlet must be
Perimeter 22-B.

680
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,800
Here's the highway...
If I can find that,

681
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,600
I can follow it directly
to the air base.

682
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,400
We need the gun we have hidden.

683
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,800
- And your flight suit.
- Yes.

684
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,400
What about
the time lock formula?

685
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,600
I'm working on it now.

686
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,800
I'm almost finished.

687
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,400
If nothing goes wrong, Allison,

688
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,800
you can be on your way
within a few hours.

689
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,400
It should be no great problem.

690
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,600
Trirene will lead us
by the guards.

691
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Good.

692
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,000
No, it is not
the equipment, Master.

693
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,400
It's another one
of their devices

694
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,000
to prevent us
from watching them.

695
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,400
They're planning an escape,
and I know it.

696
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,000
I'll put a stop to this scheme.
Just say the word.

697
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,400
They will only try again.

698
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
Trirene is helping them.

699
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,200
I fear our future is done,
Captain.

700
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,000
We have returned to the cave

701
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,800
where men first lived on earth.

702
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,600
We have returned
to our birthplace to die.

703
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,600
Through Allison and Trirene,
there is hope, Master.

704
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,400
Perhaps it is too great a hope.

705
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,000
There may be some truth
in what they say.

706
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,600
Some chance that this young man

707
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,200
could return to a time
before the plague.

708
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,400
No, it's a trick.

709
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,800
We must not
let the major escape.

710
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,600
Do not forget, Master,
our observers

711
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,200
sighted mutant scouts
again yesterday.

712
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
This is a time
for great caution.

713
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,800
I will speak to him.

714
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,400
Perhaps I can persuade him
to accept our way.

715
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,600
Yes, my Supreme.
Let me bring him to you.

716
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,400
What's the meaning of this?

717
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,800
Don't ask me questions.

718
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,600
The Supreme and I trusted you.

719
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,400
We're aware of your scheme.

720
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,200
I could explain to you forever.

721
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,000
You'd never understand!

722
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,800
I warned you to stay away
from those three.

723
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,600
Now you'll answer
to the Supreme.

724
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,000
Then you don't
believe it's possible

725
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,600
for me to return to my own time?

726
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,800
Kruse and Bourman think
the plague can be prevented

727
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,600
if I can go back
and inform my people.

728
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,800
I truly wish I could
believe your reasoning.

729
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,400
But they are using you
for their own purpose.

730
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,200
They'll bring others.

731
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,200
They'll destroy our citadel.

732
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,600
But you don't understand.

733
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,200
I'm from a time before
any of this has ever happened.

734
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,600
I must go back.

735
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,200
Such things do not exist.

736
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,000
Kruse has created these
illusions in your mind.

737
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,400
Look... As far
as I'm concerned, it's 1960.

738
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,400
You people can believe it's
2024 or any time you please.

739
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,600
None of this is real.
It's all an illusion to me.

740
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
No, my son.

741
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,800
You're wrong.

742
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
Here, touch my hand.

743
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
Is that not real flesh?

744
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,400
And these walls...
Are they not solid stone?

745
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,000
And Trirene...
You have touched her.

746
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,800
Can you say she's not real?

747
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,600
Yes, they are all
very real things!

748
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,000
But you can't prove
that what you say is true.

749
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,200
The only proof
I can offer is the fact

750
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,400
that here we are in this room.

751
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,200
Can you prove that
you are somewhere else?

752
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,600
Supreme...

753
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,000
Trirene believes
in what I'm trying to do.

754
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,800
You have faith in
her judgment, haven't you?

755
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,600
Yes, but Trirene
has fallen in love.

756
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,200
Please, I ask you...

757
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,000
Give up this futile scheme.

758
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,800
Remain here.

759
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
You will inherit our domain.

760
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,600
I'm sorry, I

761
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
I value my freedom more than this.

762
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,800
Hear me, fellow prisoners!

763
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,000
Hear me, fellow prisoners,
you're free!

764
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,200
The citadel is yours!

765
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,600
Hear me, mutants!

766
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,000
Come out of your pit of death.

767
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,400
Our time of vengeance has come!

768
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Follow me, soldiers of revenge.

769
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,800
I'll lead you to the captain,
to food, to freedom!

770
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
So you will attempt this escape,

771
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,600
even though we'll
try and stop you?

772
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,200
Yes.

773
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
I'll try to escape,
even though the captain

774
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,800
offers all resistance.

775
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,000
You will never leave
the citadel alive.

776
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,200
Well, uh...

777
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,600
That's a chance
I'll have to take.

778
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,200
I didn't think for one minute

779
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,600
the Supreme would
change your mind.

780
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,400
Now you're my responsibility.

781
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,000
And I'm gonna take charge.

782
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,600
You're going back to the pit.

783
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,600
They'll tear them to pieces!

784
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,000
Are you out of your mind?
You set them free!

785
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,600
It's part of the plan.

786
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,800
Get to your room
for your flying suit... Move!

787
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,600
Where are Kruse and Bourman?

788
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,000
We're meeting them
at the elevator up.

789
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,800
You'd better go in
and get Trirene.

790
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,400
We don't need her anymore.

791
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,600
The citadel's in chaos. The
guards won't bother with us.

792
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,800
You don't think I'd leave her
here to face this, do you?

793
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,200
I'm taking her with me.

794
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,200
You can't, Allison, you can't
take her back with you.

795
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,600
Ru try.

796
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,000
Don't you understand?

797
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,800
You can't take her back through
the time barrier with you.

798
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,000
Your world is before
she was born.

799
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,200
I'll try anyway!

800
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,200
No.

801
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,600
From now on, it's you and me.

802
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,400
I'm going back through
the time barrier with you.

803
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,800
We're going back to my time.

804
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,200
1973.

805
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,600
The formula...

806
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,000
You're double-crossing
Kruse and Bourman.

807
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,800
Not for long!

808
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,600
Leave her, Major.
There's no time, come on.

809
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,800
We're in luck.

810
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,400
The guards are being withdrawn.

811
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,200
What did you do?

812
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
I had to do it!

813
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,800
You see?
He would have killed us all.

814
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,200
Like Markova, he wanted
to your plane, Allison.

815
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,000
I think you're lying, Bourman.

816
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,800
I think you're the one who
wanted to make that flight.

817
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,600
That will be all, Major Allison!

818
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
The Supreme was right
about you and Kruse.

819
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,000
Because we wanted
to return to 1994? Yes.

820
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But you said I could prevent
the cosmic plague

821
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,400
if I could go back.

822
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,600
You could... But your people
won't believe you.

823
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,400
This is mass murder.

824
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,000
You're letting these people die!

825
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,400
I will never break
through the barrier

826
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,600
in 2024 again.

827
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,600
I will never know
anything about it.

828
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,200
Get out of your flight suit,
Allison.

829
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,800
You'll have to take it off me.

830
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,600
Trirene...

831
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

832
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,800
We're going back to my world.

833
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,800
We're free now.

834
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,400
I... I understand.

835
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,600
I'll take you
to your grandfather.

836
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,000
Now the shadow of death

837
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,600
darkens the halls
of our citadel.

838
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,000
Our bright ray of hope is gone.

839
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,600
It is the end of us.

840
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,800
No... No, it's not the end.

841
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,600
As long as we believe,
there is always hope.

842
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,000
I'll return to my time
and my people.

843
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,600
We will prevent the plague.

844
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,200
You'll not live
in a world of darkness.

845
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,600
I pray that this you believe in

846
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,400
is not a dream.

847
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,800
No, it isn't... I promise you.

848
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,400
I believe in you.

849
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,800
I lead you safely
to the surface.

850
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,200
I believe.

851
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,200
Sands Control to X-80.
Sands to X-8-O.

852
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,600
Come in, X-80.

853
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,400
Hello, Sands,
this is X-80!

854
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,000
I'm in serious trouble!

855
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,600
Coming in for a landing.
Are you reading me?

856
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,000
Alert all crash detail
to stand by.

857
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,600
What room is he in, Sergeant?

858
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,200
Operating Room Two, sir.

859
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,600
How is he?

860
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,200
I haven't... Good Lord!

861
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,800
What's happened to him, Doctor?

862
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,200
What could have caused this?

863
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,800
I don't know.

864
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,600
I have no explanation.

865
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,400
Not one word of this to anybody.

866
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,400
Keep me informed, Doctor.

867
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,400
I'll be in my office.

868
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,600
All right, Colonel.

869
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,600
Call the duty officer, Sergeant.

870
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,400
I want a guard posted
outside this door.

871
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,800
This is now a restricted area.

872
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Yes, sir.

873
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,800
This is the office
of the Chief of Staff.

874
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,000
Connect me with Secretary
Lloyd Patterson's office.

875
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Urgent.

876
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,200
Trirene was dead.

877
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,800
The Supreme gave me her ring.

878
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,800
He showed me the way out
of the citadel.

879
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,800
I got to my plane, and...
That's all I remember.

880
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
Thirty minutes later,
Allison brought the ship in

881
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,200
for an emergency landing.

882
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,400
Now the odd thing
about it is this...

883
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,200
Right after he reported in
at, uh, Position Six...

884
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,000
Major Allison is feeling
much better.

885
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,400
Good.

886
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,200
Mr. Secretary, General,

887
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,200
as you know, Bill Allison
is our leading research pilot

888
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,000
here at the test center.

889
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,400
We've always considered him
fully competent

890
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,400
and rational.

891
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,400
Dr. Richman and I have
been with him

892
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,800
for the past eight hours.

893
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,600
Dr. Richman and I are convinced

894
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,600
that he is as mentally sound
right now

895
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,200
as any normal,
well-balanced person can be.

896
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,000
I suggest we go in.

897
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,600
Mr. Secretary, General...

898
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,400
Mr. Secretary.

899
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
Thank you.

900
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,600
How 'bout it, kid?
Feel like talking?

901
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,400
I'm ready, Colonel.

902
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,800
Now, if you feel like
you need more room,

903
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,600
just say so.

904
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,800
Yeah, okay.

905
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,400
Any questions, gentlemen?

906
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,800
Mr. Patterson?

907
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,800
No, I... I don't believe so.

908
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,600
The plague... The cosmic plague!

909
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,800
None of us should go through it.

910
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
We've got to prevent it.

911
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,200
Prevent what, son?

912
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,400
The cosmic plague!

913
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
Marty, we've got to stop it!

914
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,600
Mr. Secretary,
from Intelligence.

915
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,000
They've run a check
on Professor Bourman

916
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and Karl Kruse.

917
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,800
Kruse is enrolled
in a West German university.

918
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,400
He's a leading student
in astronautics.

919
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,200
And Bourman,
another student of physics

920
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,000
and mathematics in Amsterdam.

921
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,600
He's written papers
on new propulsion systems

922
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,200
that have astounded
the scientific world.

923
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,000
Colonel Martin...

924
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,000
This is Trirene's ring...

925
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,600
The Supreme gave me.

926
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,200
Gentlemen, we have got
a lot to think about.
