1
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,457
What happened?

2
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:45,023
Jiam... Jiam

3
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:48,935
Help... Help me

4
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,639
Jiam... Jiam

5
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,626
Jiam...

6
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:08,784
Jiam... Jiam

7
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,421
Old crocodile, you are useless

8
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:43,894
Your teeth are gone

9
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,600
You can't bite anymore

10
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,797
Go, get out of my sight

11
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:49,740
Go!

12
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,280
Go or I'll beat you

13
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:57,819
Let's go

14
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,569
Old crocodile, you are useless

15
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,969
No teeth, can't bite

16
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,864
It's getting dark, let's go home

17
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:03,641
What's going on?

18
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,716
Earthquake? Let's take a look

19
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:08,152
The riverside, let's go

20
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:12,696
Is that a crocodile?

21
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,743
Where?

22
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,916
Look, over there

23
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,181
Where? I see nothing

24
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:20,587
There, look

25
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,264
What...

26
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,328
It's a log

27
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:25,666
Just a log

28
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,140
No big deal

29
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,041
No crocodile is as big as that

30
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:32,119
Let's go home

31
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,708
Help!

32
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,713
Big Crocodile! Run

33
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:01,572
Help

34
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:09,082
Run for your life, run

35
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,608

00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:56,751

00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,996
Please, save my son

38
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,347
God! Save my son

39
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,222
Be careful

40
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:23,728
Take it easy

41
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:24,868
I feel it's somewhere near

42
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:25,875
Right

43
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:27,702
Watch your steps

44
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:28,909
Damn! It's my foot

45
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:30,686
We gonna be rich if we catch it

46
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:32,817
Look around

47
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,219
Be careful

48
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:39,370
Don't get caught by it

49
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:43,821
Help, my leg

50
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,126
What?

51
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:52,668
Help, it get my leg

52
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:54,642
I lost my leg, help

53
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,480
Damn! Fool!

54
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,924
It's just a log

55
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,497
Gutless!

56
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:08,384
Come here quick

57
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:09,416
Hurry

58
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,721
This way, quick

59
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:13,162
Where?

60
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,172
Down there

61
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,246
Be careful

62
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,322
Easy

63
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,342
What are you doing?

64
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:30,677
It's Tah Soey

65
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:32,077
You want to frighten us all?

66
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:33,347
I'm hunting for that monster

67
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,003
I've been hunting it for a long time

68
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:39,033
But I fail

69
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:49,462
Pee Jun

70
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:50,303
What?

71
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:51,941
Will they blame us for

72
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,909
sneaking away from them

73
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,778
You means those gutless assholes

74
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:57,420
Don't be so loud. They can hear us

75
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,029
They've to go in bunches because

76
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,102
They're afraid to die and that's gutless

77
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,135
If we can make it with just a few of us

78
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,812
Then we are heroes

79
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,646
Right

80
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:10,554
Frankly speaking, aren't you afraid?

81
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:12,631
Shit! Looking for troubles?

82
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,404
You find something?

83
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:29,245
Look, what is that?

84
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,585
Where? I see nothing

85
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,397
There, can't you see

86
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:55,346
Go

87
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,718
Is that a crocodile?

88
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,461
It seems not, take a closer look

89
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:03,464
There

90
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:07,009
It's no crocodile, it's a lizard

91
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:11,055
It's yours, hero

92
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:24,650
Baby

93
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:38,292
Gud, my son

94
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:40,939
Don't cry, our son will be OK

95
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:44,012
He won't die

96
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,382
It's all your fault

97
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,164
I warned you not to stay in the water

98
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,463
You didn't listen and not our son is drowned

99
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,111
Stop crying, will you?

100
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:57,081
Gud

101
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:00,561
They can save him, trust him

102
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,361
I can find Gud down there

103
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,005
We did our best, sorry

104
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:07,772
Please, try one more time

105
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:09,853
I heard he has 2 beautiful daughters

106
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,890
Pretty and rich, very attractive

107
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,192
Marry them is my goal

108
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:15,734
So I decided our next stop will be there

109
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:19,074
And to see the beauties and wealth

110
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,649
What is happening there?

111
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,319
Gud

112
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:23,956
Don't worry, he still get a chance

113
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,092
No, he's dead

114
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:26,763
He won't

115
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:28,564
Someone drowned?

116
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,404
Their son Gud

117
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:34,677
I guess he must caught by the River ghost

118
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:36,988
Plaew, hold this for me

119
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,143
Gud

120
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,643
Looks like your friend is gone too

121
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,481
Don't worry, he is Kraithong

122
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,890
He is famous around here

123
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,695
Everyone knows him because of his skill

124
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:15,604
He is the best diver, the best

125
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:18,936
Don't you worry

126
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:21,152
Really?

127
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,496
Here they are

128
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:53,973
Gud, my son

129
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:55,475
Gud, Gud

130
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:58,585
Are you alright?

131
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,173
He just swallowed too much water

132
00:13:00,298 --> 00:13:01,629
Let me share my breath with him

133
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:13,528
Gud

134
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,182
Look

135
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,712
He is alive

136
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:24,387
Gud is alive

137
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,098
Thank you

138
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,998
Gud

139
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,674
Thank you

140
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:37,091
You are marvelous, you're a hero

141
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,322
What is your name?

142
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,696
Kraithong

143
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,474
So he is Kraithong

144
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,279
The best diver in the world

145
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:45,911
Kraithong

146
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,121
I am curious about something

147
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,889
Where do you learn the Breath Sharing skill

148
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:54,029
My father taught me

149
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,807
Beside it can save somebody's life

150
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,020
It's very useful to capture a girl's heart

151
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:03,298
My father used it to win my mother

152
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,001
Kraithong, help

153
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:08,475
We need help

154
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:11,218
Let's go

155
00:14:58,857 --> 00:14:59,983
See, is he brilliant?

156
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,587
He's my partner, Kraithong

157
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:15,429
I don't believe it

158
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:18,229
How can 1 single crocodile only can

159
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:19,945
Kill all the people in a village

160
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:21,582
That is a big one

161
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,482
You'll be scared to hell if you see it

162
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:25,187
Bullshit

163
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:27,700
Wait

164
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:29,069
What?

165
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:32,002
Look

166
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,875
What is it?

167
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:34,642
Impossible! So big

168
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,689
Take a closer look

169
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:44,807
Is it dead? It doesn't move a bit

170
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,108
Dead crocodile's belly will face the sky

171
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:48,186
Let's have the answer

172
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:49,722
Am I drunk?

173
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:51,692
I never see such a big one

174
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:56,206
Who care? Let's do it

175
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,407
No

176
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:15,252
Stop it. Run if you want to live

177
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:38,823
I'll kill you

178
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:46,248
Fellows

179
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,916
Our village have a disaster recently

180
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,559
A giant crocodile kills people everywhere

181
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:55,530
To pray for peace of everyone lives here

182
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,710
I want to arrange a special ritual

183
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:01,513
By the side of the river

184
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:07,967
And ask the Holy to bless us all

185
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:10,544
You're late

186
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:15,685
What do you think about this idea?

187
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,797
It sounds good

188
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:17,805
That's a good idea

189
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:19,267
We agree

190
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:20,806
Kaew, Tong

191
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:23,108
You two as my daughter

192
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:28,160
You'll be the leaders of the ritual

193
00:17:28,203 --> 00:17:29,227
Yes, Father

194
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:31,205
What if the Monster show up in the ritual?

195
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:33,102
What shall we do?

196
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,248
That's right, it's dangerous

197
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,058
Don't worry, I've arranged everything

198
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:45,602
I've send out invitation to other villages

199
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:49,082
To ask their crocodile hunters to join us

200
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:54,889
If anyone of them can kill the monster

201
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,005
I'll reward him half of my fortunes

202
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:00,956
Very attractive

203
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:03,262
Our chief is very generous

204
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,199
I'll ask my 2 children to pick

205
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:10,108
The most beautiful virgins from our village

206
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,853
To perform the ritual

207
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,721
Do you understand?

208
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:18,662
Yes, Father

209
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,738
Let's get back to the house

210
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,538
Why are you so nervous?

211
00:18:58,785 --> 00:18:59,513
That monster crocodile

212
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:02,250
It massacre the whole North Village

213
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,190
Don't worry. The water here is too shallow

214
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,960
Crocodile don't like it

215
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:08,675
We better be careful

216
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:10,177
If I were at the North Village

217
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,816
The villagers would survive from that monster

218
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,114
You know why?

219
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:15,885
Why?

220
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,994
It's afraid of me

221
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:20,333
I'm the most notorious crocodile killer

222
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:22,204
When the crocodiles sense my smell

223
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,747
They are scared to death

224
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:26,224
If I were at the North Village

225
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:29,520
That monster is a leather handbag now

226
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:38,545
Y... o... u...

227
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,057
What's the problem?

228
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,825
Y... o... u... r h... a... n... d

229
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:52,549
God! My hand

230
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:06,056
Great, we're going to North Village

231
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,996
To attend the New Years day ritual

232
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:12,805
And to meet the 2 beautiful creatures

233
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,451
I nearly forget

234
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:16,886
Do you think we need to bring our weapons

235
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:18,958
That's for sure

236
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:20,298
Huh?

237
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:26,809
My father taught me to be cautious

238
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:30,231
He was a wonderful crocodile hunter

239
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:34,437
His words is always right to me

240
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,012
Every time I fight crocodile

241
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:40,650
I feel my father's spirit is next to me and

242
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:44,230
Protect me whenever I'm in danger

243
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,952
Let's go

244
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:27,817
They say the monster crocodile is

245
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,652
As big as an elephant

246
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,131
I want to see whether it's true

247
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:36,904
The Chief said he'll reward half of his fortune

248
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,722
To someone who can kill it

249
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:42,929
My husband is going to take it for sure

250
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,334
We're going to be rich

251
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:48,110
That's for sure

252
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,245
This is only a kid's game

253
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,317
I fear no crocodile

254
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:58,898
Even the cruelest bandit was killed by me

255
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:03,782
Look, I cut his ear after his death

256
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:05,286
And keep it as a souvenir

257
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:06,690
You like to collect ears?

258
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:07,291
Right

259
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:09,037
I have the same habit too

260
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:11,071
Really? But I get more than you

261
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:12,837
Let us see it

262
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:15,053
Is this great?

263
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,692
You must be a famous head hunter

264
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:21,196
No, I am a barber

265
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,941
Up yours

266
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:17,748
Grandma, do we have enough time?

267
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:19,494
Don't worry

268
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:23,000
Sister, the ritual will be held tomorrow

269
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,076
Are you ready?

270
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:28,477
Almost done

271
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,621
What are you staring at?

272
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:55,797
I know what is in your mind now

273
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,972
Those human will perform the ritual tomorrow

274
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:01,841
I just come to check what they'll offer

275
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:06,952
You must think I'm here because of that girl

276
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:09,327
Don't be silly

277
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,265
We can't stay out from water for too long

278
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:14,027
We'll turn back to crocodile if we do

279
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:15,913
How about...

280
00:25:32,402 --> 00:25:34,927
How about let's have some happy time

281
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,668
Pal, we are lucky

282
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:13,168
Look, the 2 beautiful creatures

283
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:16,315
Let me check them out

284
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:16,990
So that's Chief's daughter you mentioned

285
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:17,856
That's right

286
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:54,821
Are you ready?

287
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,426
I'm fine

288
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,164
Let's go

289
00:27:58,438 --> 00:28:01,669
I've been waiting for this day for a long time

290
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,504
I can't wait

291
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:06,812
Me too, I even couldn't felt asleep

292
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:08,459
Good morning

293
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,433
What's wrong?

294
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:15,377
I don't want to go

295
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,081
Why?

296
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:18,685
What's the reason?

297
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:21,292
Come on

298
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:25,935
Don't worry, we'll be alright

299
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:27,112
I don't want to

300
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:29,945
Come on Let's go

301
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:18,219
Why did you ignore me last night?

302
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:21,357
I'm a lady and I have my pride

303
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:24,157
Ignoring a stranger is a proper response

304
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,441
Your face is so beautiful

305
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:29,616
How can I resist myself from looking at it?

306
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,356
You must be one of the Chief's daughter

307
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,749
You're not only looking at my face

308
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:46,964
Your eyes seemed look into my heart

309
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:48,260
Is that true?

310
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:50,541
Lucky that you don't have that kind of eyes

311
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,749
Why?

312
00:30:55,158 --> 00:30:59,026
I'm afraid you can look into my heart

313
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:05,381
And know what is in my mind

314
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:06,283
How's that? Are you ready?

315
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,482
Fine

316
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:11,723
Then what is in your mind?

317
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:18,478
You

318
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:29,709
He must be the legendary crocodile hunter

319
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,046
Kraithong from the South

320
00:31:32,394 --> 00:31:34,919
They say he is invincible

321
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,396
Like he has God as his guardian

322
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:49,069
How about the other one?

323
00:31:52,382 --> 00:31:53,940
That's Kraithong's partner

324
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:57,387
He seems interested in you

325
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:59,958
He keeps staring at you

326
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:01,238
I'm sure about it

327
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:05,467
But I'm not interested in him

328
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:14,265
Attention everyone

329
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,673
Please come forward

330
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,749
It's about time

331
00:32:20,092 --> 00:32:22,959
The New Year's Day ritual

332
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:25,132
Is ready to begun

333
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,751
It's getting dark now

334
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,221
I'm now announce

335
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,517
The ritual begins

336
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,231
What is happening?

337
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:41,008
Come out from the water, quick

338
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:42,238
Kaew, Tong

339
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:43,213
Run

340
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,456
Kaew, Tong, run

341
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:47,194
Kaew, Tong

342
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,455
Leave it alone, run

343
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:50,660
Hurry! Tong

344
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:52,837
The ritual will fail...

345
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,377
Tong, hurry

346
00:34:00,702 --> 00:34:02,226
Tong

347
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:08,714

Tong

349
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:13,623
Tong! Tong!

350
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:14,531
Father

351
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:16,434
Tong Father

352
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,373
Tong

353
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:25,023
My child

354
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:28,966
Father

355
00:39:12,628 --> 00:39:15,119
Plaew, it's too dark down there

356
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:16,893
Get me the underwater torch

357
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:44,973
Who are you? Why do...

358
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,744
Why am I here?

359
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:49,391
What is this place?

360
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:50,994
Stay away from me

361
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:21,672
Who ever kill the monster

362
00:44:22,114 --> 00:44:24,014
will get half of my fortunes

363
00:44:24,922 --> 00:44:26,981
Also my daughter, kaew will be his wife

364
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:28,490
But...

365
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,060
I said it and I'll do it

366
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:45,938
What are you crying for?

367
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:49,042
You will be happy down here

368
00:44:54,703 --> 00:44:59,231
Chalawan, how could you do this?

369
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,215
This is my place, I can do what I want to

370
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:06,993
You already have me and Luam

371
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:08,863
Why do you get a human?

372
00:45:09,444 --> 00:45:10,877
It's doesn't matter

373
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,609
Human are our enemies

374
00:45:27,795 --> 00:45:29,262
Who are you?

375
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:31,832
How can you live underwater?

376
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,272
You get anything to do with that monster?

377
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:36,176
And who are you?

378
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:37,953
How can you find this place?

379
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,290
I am of course a human

380
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:42,599
The difference is I live on land

381
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:43,894
And you live underwater

382
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:50,073
Wrong, I can live in both

383
00:45:50,357 --> 00:45:53,417
What are you doing here?

384
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:55,728
I'm taking her away

385
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:57,539
You think you can?

386
00:45:57,777 --> 00:45:58,835
Try it

387
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:46,661
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

388
00:48:16,058 --> 00:48:18,185
You go first, I'll be right away

389
00:49:00,113 --> 00:49:02,240
You...

390
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:05,685
Don't...

391
00:49:06,296 --> 00:49:07,524
Take me to Grandpa's cave

392
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:59,996
I need to recover my strength there

393
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,144
Take it easy

394
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:23,230
They are back. Great

395
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:24,373
He's marvelous

396
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:26,772
Tong! Tong!

397
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:28,851
Are you alright?

398
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:31,986
Tong! My child!

399
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:33,798
He's really a hero

400
00:50:34,105 --> 00:50:35,732
How do you feel?

401
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,602
Don't cry

402
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,473
Talk to me, Tong

403
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:41,618
What happened?

404
00:50:41,893 --> 00:50:42,882
Say something

405
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,790
What happened to her?

406
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,934
What's going on?

407
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,339
Talk to me, my child

408
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,408
What happen to her?

409
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:54,056
She may be swallowed too much water

410
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,894
She will recover soon

411
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,767
She can talk when she gets better

412
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:01,142
That wound should finish him

413
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:08,962
But how come my knife gets rusty

414
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:16,210
I think he'll never come up again

415
00:51:17,926 --> 00:51:19,655
But who is he?

416
00:51:19,698 --> 00:51:21,689
How can he lives underwater?

417
00:51:23,374 --> 00:51:24,534
What's wrong?

418
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:26,732
There are 2 kind of people around here

419
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:28,383
Land people and underwater ones

420
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:31,257
I think that monster crocodile is

421
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:42,967
Raised by those underwater people

422
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:51,207
Now, I'm going to keep my promise

423
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:54,782
You'll have half of my fortunes

424
00:51:55,262 --> 00:52:01,326
And Kaew will be your wife tomorrow

425
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:02,277
Wait...

426
00:52:07,362 --> 00:52:08,954
But Father...

427
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,076
I'm curious about something

428
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,321
You surprise me with staying underwater

429
00:52:30,626 --> 00:52:32,457
for such a long time

430
00:52:32,865 --> 00:52:34,594
But how can Tong stay such a long time

431
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:37,534
She can't breath underwater like you

432
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,112
While we escape from underwater

433
00:52:40,387 --> 00:52:44,915
I kept sharing my breath with her

434
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:48,629
Sharing breath? How?

435
00:52:50,347 --> 00:52:51,473
Mouth to mouth

436
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,877
Really?

437
00:52:53,756 --> 00:52:58,159
I guess I have no alternatives

438
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:04,465
Both of my daughters will be your wife

439
00:53:05,355 --> 00:53:09,587
You lucky fellow, what about me!

440
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,616
But Father, is that okay?

441
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:23,423
No problem, It's hard to find such a brave

442
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:27,334
And good looking son in law

443
00:53:37,978 --> 00:53:41,914
Son, I always by your side

444
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:44,918
No one can hurt you

445
00:54:09,766 --> 00:54:11,427
How's Tong? Is she getting better?

446
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,431
She is sleeping

447
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:16,007
Don't worry about her

448
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:18,808
She'll be the bride tomorrow

449
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:22,321
I know she love you very much

450
00:54:23,904 --> 00:54:25,064
How about you?

451
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:29,809
I know your partner likes me

452
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:33,147
But he's not my kind of man

453
00:54:35,202 --> 00:54:37,602
What about me?

454
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:42,373
I'll do what my Father says

455
00:54:43,057 --> 00:54:45,582
He gave me to you

456
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:48,867
And I'm yours

457
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:21,556
I heard your father captured your mother

458
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:24,162
With that breath sharing technique

459
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:25,700
Is that true?

460
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,881
It's true. To perform breath sharing

461
00:55:31,124 --> 00:55:33,456
I can do it on land as well

462
00:55:38,778 --> 00:55:44,080
Come on, let me show you

463
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:10,220
No... I can't breath

464
00:57:51,328 --> 00:57:52,420
Where is the wedding ceremony?

465
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:53,625
Over there?

466
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,297
Thanks

467
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,616
Enjoy yourself

468
00:59:14,992 --> 00:59:18,120
They are not human. They are crocodile

469
00:59:18,668 --> 00:59:21,899
Crocodile with spiritual power

470
00:59:22,178 --> 00:59:24,305
They can transform into human

471
00:59:24,952 --> 00:59:28,251
You, crocodile hunter form the South

472
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,667
Let me warn you

473
00:59:34,077 --> 00:59:37,274
Your knife corroded because of his blood

474
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:40,055
He is a devil

475
00:59:40,094 --> 00:59:41,994
His name is Chalawan

476
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,328
What is happening?

477
00:59:56,205 --> 00:59:57,194
Who is that old man?

478
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,305
Where does he come from?

479
01:00:11,113 --> 01:00:12,876
He lives by the river bank

480
01:00:13,185 --> 01:00:14,482
His name is Ta Soey

481
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:17,350
People call him Soey the maniac

482
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:19,428
They said his wife was

483
01:00:19,804 --> 01:00:24,935
Killed by a giant crocodile

484
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:44,999
Today is my bad day

485
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,741
I never think of such a human being

486
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:48,912
Process such a strong power

487
01:00:49,352 --> 01:00:51,946
How long will you stay here?

488
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:54,284
Until I completely recover

489
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:58,102
I am going to stay in this cave from now on

490
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:00,367
And take a long rest

491
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:02,145
To regret for those human I killed

492
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:04,319
I swear I'll never kill again

493
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,218
But there's an old fellow

494
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:08,766
He keeps hunting me in the past few years

495
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,368
To revenge his wife's death

496
01:01:11,747 --> 01:01:14,113
He learns how to make the 7 metal spear

497
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:18,393
Which is the only weapon that can kill me

498
01:01:19,234 --> 01:01:23,227
If he cooperate with the man today

499
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:25,806
I'll be in danger

500
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:41,858
The time has come

501
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:57,927
I keep hunting him since that night

502
01:01:58,275 --> 01:02:00,266
I dived myself crazy for that

503
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:11,464
Don't go too far

504
01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:13,575
We'll be back soon

505
01:02:17,528 --> 01:02:19,359
I want to know how can I kill him?

506
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:23,259
Nobody's been able to wound him

507
01:02:23,846 --> 01:02:25,814
You are the only one

508
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:28,646
I proves that you're not common people

509
01:02:28,993 --> 01:02:32,258
But normal weapon can't take his life

510
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:35,304
His blood corrodes every metal

511
01:02:35,644 --> 01:02:37,134
Unless you can combine 7 metals

512
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:39,883
And use it to make a spear

513
01:02:40,558 --> 01:02:42,549
Only if Chalawan dies

514
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:47,526
Your wife can talk again

515
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:49,345
Let me show you something

516
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:10,461
Ta Soey! Ta Soey!

517
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:12,235
Ta Soey!

518
01:03:18,496 --> 01:03:20,896
Ta Soey! Watch out!

519
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,471
Ta Soey!

520
01:03:28,356 --> 01:03:29,823
It's not Chalawan

521
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:45,116
Ta Soey! Plaew, hurry

522
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:50,568
Slowly, I'm afraid

523
01:03:50,852 --> 01:03:51,978
Plaew!

524
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,393
What's happening?

525
01:03:57,738 --> 01:03:58,932
Plaew!

526
01:04:01,314 --> 01:04:04,374
Plaew, help!

527
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:14,004
Run

528
01:05:12,477 --> 01:05:19,713
Kraithong, what are you doing?

529
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:23,800
Sharpen my weapon

530
01:05:24,142 --> 01:05:26,736
I'm doing to duel with Chalawan

531
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:30,814
He must die

532
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:34,428
Chalawan process a curse on you

533
01:05:34,905 --> 01:05:36,668
That's why you can not talk

534
01:05:37,178 --> 01:05:40,614
The only way to cure you is to kill him

535
01:05:41,623 --> 01:05:45,218
Soey ask me to make the 7 metal spear

536
01:05:45,969 --> 01:05:50,770
It's the only way that can kill the monster

537
01:05:52,688 --> 01:05:54,315
It's too dangerous

538
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,593
I understand you worry about me

539
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:02,840
But for Tong, for South and North Village

540
01:06:03,116 --> 01:06:05,209
For the people who live by the river

541
01:06:05,656 --> 01:06:09,786
I must kill this devil

542
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:12,770
Otherwise they all will become his preys

543
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,619
Chalawan... Chalawan

544
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:22,370
Chalawan...

545
01:07:56,763 --> 01:07:58,230
Where have you been?

546
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:00,434
I've killed that old man already

547
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:10,555
Why did you do that?

548
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:16,501
Why don't you listen to me? If...

549
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:18,418
Go block the cave's entrance

550
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:23,663
Now we are safe

551
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:45,516
I swear I'll never kill again

552
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,429
Aren't you forget about it?

553
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:54,644
I must get Vimala back now

554
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,282
You're wounded, how can you go out?

555
01:08:58,632 --> 01:08:59,997
Let me find her

556
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:01,226
You can't go

557
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:05,906
You're still breeding

558
01:09:07,256 --> 01:09:09,417
That human can trace your blood

559
01:09:09,797 --> 01:09:11,924
And find this cave

560
01:09:12,705 --> 01:09:14,900
But if I don't bring Vimala back

561
01:09:15,312 --> 01:09:18,110
He will force her to talk

562
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,785
And find out this place

563
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:08,556
No!

564
01:11:08,825 --> 01:11:09,553
Where is Chalawan?

565
01:11:09,828 --> 01:11:10,692
I don't know

566
01:11:11,131 --> 01:11:12,962
I know you're not human

567
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:14,432
Stay away from me

568
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,289
Are you armed?

569
01:11:22,562 --> 01:11:23,620
Take a look by yourself

570
01:11:52,912 --> 01:11:54,140
I don't think you have

571
01:12:22,962 --> 01:12:25,021
No, please

572
01:12:25,302 --> 01:12:26,997
Don't hurt me

573
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,535
I won't harm you

574
01:12:30,717 --> 01:12:35,051
You're so pretty, so charming

575
01:12:37,001 --> 01:12:39,094
Please don't hurt me

576
01:12:39,441 --> 01:12:40,840
I'm afraid of blood

577
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:58,875
I swear I'll never kill again

578
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,235
Chalawan

579
01:16:17,742 --> 01:16:19,039
What is happening here?

580
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,661
Sister, tell me what's going on?

581
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:08,204
Where is Chalawan?

582
01:17:08,716 --> 01:17:10,809
Why the cave is shaking?

583
01:17:11,523 --> 01:17:13,252
It's all my fault

584
01:17:21,384 --> 01:17:24,046
Chalawan is fighting with Kraithong

585
01:17:28,136 --> 01:17:30,661
Blood... what happened to you?

586
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,400
I...

587
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,011
It looks bad

588
01:17:36,325 --> 01:17:37,883
Wait for me here

589
01:17:38,164 --> 01:17:39,859
I get Chalawan back

590
01:18:33,082 --> 01:18:35,175
Give me strength, Father

591
01:18:35,455 --> 01:18:37,821
My power is gone

592
01:18:41,304 --> 01:18:42,931
Get the 7 metal spear

593
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,576
It's next to you

594
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:51,191
Kraithong...

595
01:19:51,765 --> 01:19:52,629
What?

596
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:55,372
Sister, I can talk

597
01:19:55,676 --> 01:19:56,700
I can talk now

598
01:19:57,079 --> 01:19:57,977
Father

599
01:19:58,283 --> 01:19:59,307
I can talk now

600
01:19:59,854 --> 01:20:01,219
You can talk at last

601
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,540
Chalawan uses his last breath

602
01:20:46,984 --> 01:20:49,851
To order all the crocodile to attack human

603
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,716
You must speak out the spell I taught you

604
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:56,002
At the moment Chalawan die

605
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:59,408
Then the crocodiles will leave peacefully

606
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:23,044
Help him out of water

607
01:21:23,751 --> 01:21:26,049
Come on

608
01:21:27,295 --> 01:21:30,230
This way, my son

609
01:21:30,603 --> 01:21:32,867
You're the best, best of the best

610
01:21:33,211 --> 01:21:35,042
Stop pushing him

611
01:21:35,384 --> 01:21:40,447
Be careful

612
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,053
I never seen such a big one

613
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:56,602
So what? It's dead

614
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:00,475
It kills to many, it deserves it

615
01:22:00,954 --> 01:22:03,923
Devil

616
01:22:43,905 --> 01:22:47,636
Listen everyone

617
01:22:48,251 --> 01:22:51,311
Chalawan is dead now

618
01:22:51,627 --> 01:22:53,595
We can live in peace again

619
01:22:53,933 --> 01:22:58,768
We must thank Kraithong, my son in law

620
01:22:59,114 --> 01:23:01,207
He saves us from the devil

621
01:23:11,347 --> 01:23:13,577
After marry, Kraithong lives the old way

622
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:16,684
He stays half of his time on land

623
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:19,997
The rest, he goes underwater

624
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:54,025
Don't

625
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:01,884
How come you are bleeding?

626
01:24:07,302 --> 01:24:08,701
It's not Chalawan

627
01:24:09,675 --> 01:24:11,609
So you're the one who killed Ta Soey

628
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:20,294
Let me check your wound

629
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:22,798
Don't

630
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:33,030
Come on

631
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,966
Be gentle, don't hurt me

632
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,136
I'm afraid of blood

633
01:24:36,181 --> 01:24:37,443
Really?

634
01:28:06,996 --> 01:28:08,657
What's wrong?

635
01:28:10,405 --> 01:28:12,373
Don't cry, we are the same

636
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:14,105
We both are created by God

637
01:28:14,449 --> 01:28:16,644
We can live in peace and love

638
01:28:20,065 --> 01:28:23,796
Kraithong, you killed Chalawan

639
01:28:24,209 --> 01:28:27,269
How can you take his mistress?

640
01:28:30,025 --> 01:28:32,619
Chalawan and you are different

641
01:28:33,636 --> 01:28:35,831
He's a devil, he's blood thirsty

642
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:38,545
But you're afraid of blood, you are good

643
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,153
Even though Luam killed Ta Soey

644
01:28:44,298 --> 01:28:46,391
Only if she becomes my wife

645
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,366
Everyone will forgive her sin

646
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:50,845
What about me?

647
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:58,258
I'll love you as I love the others, trust me
