1
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,380
Greece is all ruins.

2
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,100
It's just for tourists.

3
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,180
I'm glad we came here.

4
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,700
If we combine our savings,

5
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,940
we could buy an apartment next year.

6
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,580
I might even be working out here
for about a year.

7
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,780
Here?

8
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,420
Don't you like Australia?

9
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,620
It's the biggest branch outside Japan.

10
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,140
With the experience that I'd get,

11
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,700
I should be up for promotion.

12
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,700
They like people with
international experience.

13
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,940
- Your salad, sir.
- Thank you.

14
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,140
I wonder if he's a real Greek?

15
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,940
Are you all right?

16
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,780
I'm just a little tired.

17
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,700
You don't want to go back
to Japan tomorrow, do you?

18
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,580
Hello.

19
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,100
You're still here?

20
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,820
Yes. It's our last night.

21
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,500
Have a farewell drink with us.

22
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,020
Back in Tokyo,
they would never forgive me...

23
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,820
if I didn't entertain you on your last night.

24
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,300
I'll only keep him for one drink, Mrs. Takada.

25
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,980
I won't be long.

26
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,500
This is one of our employees,
Yukio Takada.

27
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,140
How do you do?

28
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,620
Please excuse him, he's on his honeymoon.

29
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,100
Thank you for everything.

30
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,900
Enjoy yourselves tonight, won't you?

31
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,460
Midori-chan?

32
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,020
Midori-chan?

33
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,540
Midori!

34
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
<i>- You saw her leaving the lift?
- Yes, sir.</i>

35
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,420
- And she was heading towards her room?
- Yes, sir.

36
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,860
I got off on this floor to deliver a file, sir.

37
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,740
And that was the last time you saw her?

38
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,260
- We've cameras there and at the staff door.
- So that's the out?

39
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,180
Between when he left to have a drink
and when he arrived in his bedroom.

40
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,460
Kinda cute, isn't she?

41
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,220
Well, maybe she just pissed off,
couldn't stand him or something.

42
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,660
It was their honeymoon.

43
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,420
Got something. Staff entrance.

44
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,740
The hotel manager's just had a call.
It was her.

45
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,820
All she said was that she'd been kidnapped.

46
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,940
- That's all?
- Yes.

47
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,500
- And then she put the phone down.
- How much English does he understand?

48
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,700
A little.

49
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,660
Tell him that his wife has run and
all she said was that she was kidnapped.

50
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Your wife rang the hotel manager

51
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,420
and said she'd been kidnapped.

52
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,220
That was all she said.

53
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,460
Does he have any idea
why she'd be kidnapped?

54
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,500
Do you have any idea
why she was kidnapped?

55
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,060
No!

56
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,860
<i>Now, an update on the kidnapping
of the Japanese honeymooner.</i>

57
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,780
...she was gone.

58
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,260
It was the last night of our honeymoon.

59
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I don't know why she's been kidnapped.

60
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,140
If the kidnappers are watching this,

61
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,660
please give me back my wife.

62
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,220
I beg you!

63
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,660
Please, give her back to me!

64
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,140
Shit!

65
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,100
Like this.

66
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,180
So, she paid you to take her out this way?

67
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,340
I felt sorry for her.

68
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,460
Said she hated her husband,
she wanted to leave him.

69
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,780
We know where she is. Paradiso Motel.
The manager just called.

70
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
Come on, let's go!

71
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,100
Use the key this time!

72
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,700
Break it down.

73
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,940
You two, check the bathroom. Done.

74
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,580
An international code.

75
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,580
Yeah, Japan.
Same number over and over again.

76
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,940
Could have gone anywhere, Bish.

77
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,300
Hey, who's gonna pay the bill?

78
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,580
His wife rang one number in Tokyo
over and over again.

79
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,260
It was the manager of a software firm
she worked for.

80
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,940
A man by the name of Sadao Kinugasa.

81
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,340
Your wife rang one number in Tokyo
over and over.

82
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,300
It was the manager of
the company she worked for.

83
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,900
His name is Sadao Kinugasa.

84
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,620
The Japanese police spoke to him.

85
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,340
It appears his wife and Sadao
had a relationship.

86
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,940
The Japanese police spoke to him.

87
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,620
It appears your wife
and he had a relationship.

88
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,420
And she planned to leave him in Australia.

89
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,860
The manager was gonna fly out
and they'd live together.

90
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,060
But at the last moment he got cold feet.

91
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,500
She planned to leave you here in Australia.

92
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,020
The manager was going to fly out here

93
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,980
and they would live together.

94
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,260
But, at the last moment, he got cold feet.

95
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

96
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,860
- He took that well.
- You think?

97
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,820
I mean, he'll be the most publicized
cuckold in Japan.

98
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,060
I can have you back on a plane to Tokyo
in a few hours.

99
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,220
She destroyed me.

100
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,460
Go back to Japan.

101
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,460
I can't!

102
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,460
I'm a laughingstock.

103
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,140
Why don't you come and stay with me
until things settle down?

104
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,060
You can't stay here.

105
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,820
Hello?

106
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,340
"Dear Yukio,

107
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,180
How can I apologize to you
for what I've done?

108
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,060
I don't think you'll forgive me,

109
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,820
no matter what I say.

110
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,420
I have no idea what I am going to do
in the future.

111
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,020
What I've done is unforgivable.

112
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,180
I hope you never meet
another woman like me.

113
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,100
I am really, really sorry."

114
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,060
Dad.

115
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,820
This is the fella I was telling you about.

116
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,140
- You drive a car good?
- He's brilliant.

117
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,500
- You drive a car good?
- He's brilliant.

118
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,060
This is Gill Boden, my brother,
and Tony, good friend of the family.

119
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,860
Butchers don't do it right.

120
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,940
Has he done this sort of thing before?

121
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,540
No, but he's the best driver I've ever seen.

122
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,580
- What's your name?
- Colin.

123
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,700
Are you gonna help us?

124
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,220
- Well, are you?
- Yeah, all right.

125
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,740
Why are you doing this?

126
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,380
I need the money.

127
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,940
He had a crash repair business.
It went broke.

128
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,060
He owes money.

129
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,340
Now I'm gonna trust you.

130
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,940
If you let me and my sons down...

131
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,460
then I'm gonna kill you.

132
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,940
What if they let me down,
you gonna kill them?

133
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,500
I hope...

134
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,700
you drive fancy as you talk.

135
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,220
I do.

136
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,500
Here.

137
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,580
I don't need a gun, man.

138
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,620
- Take the gun.
- Hey, I'm just the chauffeur.

139
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,300
You do what we agreed. We share the risk.

140
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,620
Hey, I'm doing you a favor. You carry a gun.

141
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,420
Next.

142
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,340
Next.

143
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,180
- Teller five.
- Thank you.

144
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,940
- Can I have change?
- I have to see your passport.

145
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,100
Here.

146
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,700
Down! Get on the floor, all of you!

147
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,420
Get on the floor!

148
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,900
Everybody down!
Everybody, on the floor! On the floor!

149
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,940
- Get down!
- Move it!

150
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,260
Want some tellers here.

151
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,500
We want to know where...

152
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,260
Fill that up.

153
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,540
Shit!

154
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,740
Put the fucking screen down!

155
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,940
- Let's get on it! Let's go!
- Fucking put it down!

156
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,140
- We're out of here! Come on!
- What about him?

157
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,380
- Come on! Let's go!
- What about him?

158
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,820
- We can't leave him there!
- It's too late, mate. Too late!

159
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Come on, let's go!

160
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,900
Come on!

161
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,580
Everybody stay down, stay down!

162
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,140
Told you. Christ!

163
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,300
Let's go!

164
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,180
We've got a girl!

165
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,940
I swear, we'll shoot her!

166
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,140
Get in the car. Get in the fucking car!
Move it!

167
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,340
Shit!

168
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,140
Where'd the bloody coppers come from?
The stupid bastards!

169
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,060
- What happened to Tony?
- The fucking idiot's dead!

170
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,780
You're supposed to watch
the fucking teller...

171
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,540
- you stupid bastard!
- Shut up!

172
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,500
What are you doing? She's seen you!

173
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,060
- So fucking what?
- You fucking take care of it now.

174
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,300
Fuck!

175
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,900
Shut the fuck up!
Or I'll fucking kill you, all right?

176
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,900
- Come here!
- No!

177
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,540
- What are you doing?
- She saw us.

178
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,180
You can't just kill her.

179
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,140
She didn't do anything.

180
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,980
You stay in the car, Colin.

181
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,580
You stay in the fucking car!

182
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,740
Get down! Down!

183
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,980
Stay down!

184
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Brother!

185
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,580
Oh, Jesus.

186
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,260
Go back to the car.

187
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,020
- She didn't do anything, man.
- She! Who the fuck is she?

188
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,780
You killed my brother!

189
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,260
You stay there.

190
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,020
Stay there!

191
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,860
You fucking traitor.
I'm gonna come and get you!

192
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,660
You'll never get away with this!

193
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,020
- I'll find you!
- Get in the car!

194
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,260
You're a fucking dead man!
You're a dead man, you hear me?

195
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,740
You're gonna fucking die, man!

196
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,140
It's her, and she left these behind.

197
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,380
She dropped it during the robbery.
I had it translated. It's an apology to him.

198
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
He said, "Why is she doing this to me?"

199
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
You're on your own.

200
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,580
It's safer if you stay here.

201
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,580
He took her hostage! If he had listened
to me, he wouldn't be shot!

202
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,420
You bastard.

203
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,340
You give him the gun.

204
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,220
And he killed your brother.

205
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,660
- Hello?
- I wanna speak to Mahood.

206
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,780
It's Colin.

207
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,700
Colin.

208
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,020
You know it was an accident
with your brother, mate.

209
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,140
You said to me no one would get hurt.

210
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,380
I'm not gonna pretend I'm not angry, Colin.

211
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,340
Things just got a little out of hand.
You know?

212
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,940
What about you?

213
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,220
You okay? You need some money?

214
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,100
No, I'll manage, mate.

215
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,620
<i>Look, things got a bit messy,
didn't they, you know?</i>

216
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,980
Just thought I'd try
and do you a bit of a favor.

217
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,660
<i>Where are you, mate?</i>

218
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,900
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

219
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,860
I'll call you when I get to a town.

220
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,500
We get gasoline for the car?

221
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,940
Can you get me a hamburger?

222
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,860
Hamburger?

223
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,740
Yeah, hamburger. Just right over there.

224
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,060
- Hamburger.
- Okay.

225
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,060
- Yeah.
- Hungry?

226
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,420
Christ, I've never seen one
without a camera before.

227
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,660
Excuse me.

228
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,740
- Can I have a hamburger?
- Sure. What would you like on it?

229
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,140
A hamburger.

230
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,900
Do you want the lot?

231
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,700
- A lot?
- The lot.

232
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,140
Bacon, lettuce, cheese, tomato, sauce.

233
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,380
The lot?

234
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,260
What the hell are you doing with my truck?

235
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,740
Don't you realize that stealing is a crime?

236
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,340
You're so lucky I'm not
on Benzedrine today.

237
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,740
Otherwise, I'd be doing
a lot more than hurting you.

238
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,340
I think I'll ask what his hamburger wants.

239
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,740
Thank you.

240
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
No! Don't do that!

241
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,380
Piss off!

242
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,260
Naughty boy!

243
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,260
You let our standards slip...

244
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,020
by interbreeding with inferior races...

245
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,500
and before you know it...

246
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,100
we'll be breeding halfwits and mongrels!

247
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,060
You okay?

248
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,900
Why didn't you just tell him?

249
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,940
I was coward.

250
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,460
He was so desperate to marry me.

251
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,940
And my parents says it's a good choice.

252
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,700
I thought I could do it. But I was wrong.

253
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,460
Why don't you just give yourself up?

254
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,420
Tell them I kidnapped you
and forced you to help me.

255
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,260
No.

256
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,260
Don't you wanna get back to Japan?

257
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:31,660
Don't you wanna get back to Japan?

258
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,860
No.

259
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,500
I don't want to go back.

260
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,500
I have no future there.

261
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,820
Many people in Japan...

262
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,380
they have no true life.

263
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,580
Everybody has dream,
but they scared to make dream come true...

264
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,580
because they raised in a certain way.

265
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,620
That's why...

266
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,940
I like Sadao.

267
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,580
He was my lover.

268
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,660
He said...

269
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,500
we would live here...

270
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,620
you know?

271
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,900
We would have a future.

272
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,420
But he was too scared to leave.

273
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,900
I was stupid.

274
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,060
But I dreamt that I could have a new life.

275
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,100
It was all my fault.

276
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,300
I think I should have told Yukio
the truth from the beginning.

277
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,740
What is that?

278
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,740
It's a kookaburra.

279
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,420
Kookaburra?

280
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,700
It's a bird.

281
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,220
The bird?

282
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,660
The bird laughs?

283
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,700
This is strange country.

284
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,100
I can breathe here.

285
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,700
What do we do now?

286
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,300
- Keep on going?
- Not without money.

287
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,460
I know how to get money.

288
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,260
From a bank.

289
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,980
I've had enough of banks.

290
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,700
We can do better than your friend.

291
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,260
When we do it...

292
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,060
we can go backward.

293
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,140
- I hate people staring at me when I eat.
- Sorry, Bish.

294
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,860
Yeah, so what?

295
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,820
This morning at a country bank.

296
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,940
This morning.

297
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,220
Looks like they're a team.

298
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,140
The police think they're a team.

299
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,020
I'll kill her.

300
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,540
What'd he say?

301
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,100
He said she's a strange woman.

302
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,140
One in a million, all right.

303
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,180
Were you in on the robbery
with your brother?

304
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,420
- No.
- So he did it without your knowledge.

305
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,820
I was not my brother's keeper, all right?

306
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,980
You seemed to me
to be a pretty close-knit family.

307
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,660
He was a bad boy.

308
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,940
So it would seem.

309
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,420
Do you know who those people are?

310
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,180
No.

311
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,140
My bet is...

312
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,940
that the bloke in the balaclava
shot your son.

313
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,940
Keep an eye on them.

314
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,820
Christ, fancy living here
with that yodeling five times a day.

315
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,300
We might as well be in fucking Arabia.

316
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,940
- Can you hack into systems?
- What sort?

317
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,580
You know, American Express,
or something like that.

318
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,540
Sure, given time.

319
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,420
What about hotel or motel chains?

320
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,340
Check it out.

321
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,180
Well, he's always been wearing a balaclava.

322
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,780
So nobody knows who he is.

323
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,260
He's traveling across country.

324
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,340
He'll check into a motel.

325
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,780
And use his real name.

326
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,140
We'll check every day.

327
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,500
I will be vengeance.

328
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,060
No AIC?

329
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,980
No. Fair enough.

330
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,740
I'll give you $250 off.

331
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,140
- Indicators don't work?
- It's only a fuse.

332
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,700
Hand brake's fucked.

333
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,340
Don't park on any hills.

334
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,740
All right, $300 off. That's it.

335
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,060
- Done.
- Good.

336
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,340
We'll leave that for 30 minutes.

337
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,340
Nice hands.

338
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,300
- What?
- Nice lines.

339
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,460
Except for that one.

340
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,620
What does it mean?

341
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,060
You or somebody important to you
dies suddenly.

342
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,380
When?

343
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,180
I don't know.

344
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,620
Palms don't have dates.

345
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,260
See?

346
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,180
Follow along yours.

347
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,060
The rest of your palm's great.

348
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,260
- You got any welding gear?
- Yep.

349
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,780
- Can I use it?
- Be my guest.

350
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,940
It's $25 an hour.

351
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,740
Two hours minimum.

352
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,300
What a spunk.

353
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,820
Spunk?

354
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,620
It's when you give a blowjob
on the first date.

355
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,060
Blowjob?

356
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,460
It's something to do with whales.

357
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,060
I can breathe!

358
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,820
They robbed the bank in this town.

359
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,540
I'm going to find her.

360
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,180
But you don't know where she is.

361
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,580
I can find out.

362
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,540
There are not many Japanese
in the countryside.

363
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,940
I've read this. I'll track her down.

364
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,020
Leave it to the police.

365
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,940
But they don't want to kill her like I do.

366
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,540
Yukio, stop this! Go back to Japan!

367
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,740
Only after I've killed her.

368
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,540
I want you to get me a gun.

369
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,100
I can't do that!

370
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,780
Get me a motorbike and get me a gun,

371
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,220
and you'll never see me again.

372
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,780
I hope you don't find her.

373
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,780
All I want is to ask her
why she embarrassed me

374
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,180
in front of millions of people.

375
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,020
I went to some effort to get this,

376
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,820
and it can't be traced.

377
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,100
Is there a safety catch on this?

378
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,420
How would I know?

379
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,180
It looks like a toy...

380
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,260
I think that's enough practice for today.

381
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,460
What are you doing?

382
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,540
Changing our fate.

383
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,220
Are you okay?

384
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,580
Jeez, Japs taking over heaven, too?

385
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,140
You're lucky we didn't kill you.

386
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,140
Call that luck?
Unless you got a bottle of Scotch.

387
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,540
Where yous two heading?

388
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,340
My dad's got a farm outside Rally Town.

389
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,180
Rally Town.
I used to shear sheep down there.

390
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,220
What's his name?

391
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,540
- O'Brien.
- I know him. Did a season for him.

392
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,060
He's okay. Top man in his field.

393
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,620
Why are you out here?

394
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,540
Couple of smart bastards kidnapped me
in a pub last night.

395
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,140
Pissed as they were,
they dropped me out here.

396
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,020
- Why?
- They're fucking wankers, that's why.

397
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,700
They know nothing about classical music.

398
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,900
And nothing about accordions.

399
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,580
Maybe your mates know something
about noise pollution.

400
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,180
What the fuck you mean by that?

401
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,620
Don't you know any other tune?

402
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,580
This isn't a tune, mate.
This is a masterpiece.

403
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,540
Hey, why don't you play something
we all know?

404
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,060
What would you fucking know, pal?

405
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,620
Why don't you just stop
fucking playing, huh?

406
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,460
Fucking make me.

407
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,140
I think I fucking will.

408
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,180
All right. A bit of radio.

409
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,900
If you hang on to this,
it would be a major favor.

410
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,780
Yeah, just give it here, you fuck.

411
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,420
- Look out for yourself. Smile.
- Yeah, thanks for the lift.

412
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,780
Which way's that motel?

413
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,100
About an hour down the road,
you can't miss it. Straight ahead.

414
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,340
- Bye, Jonah.
- See you later.

415
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,620
Bye.

416
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,300
Cretins.

417
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,340
A beer!

418
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,340
- Please.
- Give us a break, Gloria.

419
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,100
Could I have a beer, please?

420
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,460
You couldn't fucking get rid of me,
could you, you pack of scumbags?

421
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,460
Jonah, stop it.

422
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,820
Get out of here. Go on, get out.

423
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,300
Now throw me out!

424
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,780
You stop that bloody racket.

425
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,220
It's not racket, it's music!

426
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,060
Hey...

427
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,860
- How long do you wanna stay?
- Just a day.

428
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,580
- Maybe two.
- Room 19.

429
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,740
Thanks.

430
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,940
Thank you very much. Okay. Bye.

431
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,700
Are you sure that's him?

432
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,980
The woman at the motel said
he's with a Japanese or Chinese girl.

433
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,860
- That's him all right.
- How long will it take us to get there?

434
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,980
We hire a light plane, three, four hours.

435
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,420
We are not hiring a plane.

436
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,980
We can be traced then.

437
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,340
It's 14 or 15 by car.

438
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,460
We are going to do it in my way.

439
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,540
Come.

440
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,660
I'm your bloke.

441
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,100
Look out.

442
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,540
Now let me get this right.

443
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,420
You're Laurel and I'm Hardy.

444
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,140
You can take the double.

445
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,220
I like this one.

446
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,980
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

447
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,220
I really like this.

448
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,020
- I feel like I'm alive.
- Good.

449
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,540
I like you very much.

450
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,420
- Do you like me?
- Yes, I do.

451
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,620
I made a mistake with my husband.

452
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,900
I didn't love him.

453
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,300
And my other mistake was my boss.

454
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,420
I thought I loved him.

455
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,780
That's okay.

456
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,420
People make mistakes.

457
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,020
Two bad, bad mistakes.

458
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,820
But you're not a mistake.

459
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,020
Thanks.

460
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,020
I really feel...

461
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,860
deep thing in my heart for you.

462
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,460
There's nothing wrong with that.

463
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,540
I don't want to hurt you.

464
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,940
I'm bad luck.

465
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,740
Bad luck for any man.

466
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,700
I have dreamt of this,
even when I was awake.

467
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,860
She's not here.

468
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,700
Where's the Jap?

469
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,580
She left me.

470
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,220
Where is she?

471
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,780
You are not going to tell us.

472
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,900
Very well.

473
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,900
We'd sooner talk to you.

474
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,180
Didn't mean to kill your son.

475
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,700
There is a hurt, here...

476
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,620
where my son should be.

477
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,060
Now I have to fix this hurt.

478
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,420
What is the saying?

479
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,100
An eye for an eye, a hand for a hand.

480
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:43,580
Well, I want a heart for a heart.

481
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

482
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,180
Are you looking for something in particular?

483
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,260
Can I have a makeup?

484
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,020
We don't have makeup. Just what you see.

485
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,500
Come here.

486
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,380
You have a beautiful face.

487
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,740
Thank you.

488
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,620
He was gonna kill an innocent woman.

489
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,860
I think that before you talk...

490
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,860
you best listen to me.

491
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,940
See these eyes?

492
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,420
They have seen a lot.

493
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,340
I have seen men naked on stone floors...

494
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,100
shitting themselves in fear.

495
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,820
I have seen men with broken backs
and torn out eyes begging to be killed.

496
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,140
I have seen men, strong man...

497
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:44,940
weeping tears of blood
when I touch electrodes to their pricks.

498
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,380
I have seen what men
are capable of doing to other men.

499
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,620
And what men go to is without boundaries.

500
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,580
In Afghanistan, where I come from...

501
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,860
I was an interrogator for the Russians
after they had invaded us.

502
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,260
People ask me,
why did I interrogate my own people.

503
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,940
The answer was simple.

504
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,300
I was good at it.

505
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,660
The important thing is to see...

506
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,780
what is happening to you.

507
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,500
Which is why mirrors are a great help.

508
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,500
- Can I buy these things?
- What things?

509
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,260
Clothes on these dolls.

510
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,620
- Oh, the store dummies.
- Yes...

511
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,420
Sure.
But you'll have to undress them yourself.

512
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,060
Yeah.

513
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,660
The other one.

514
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,620
I said the other one!

515
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,660
A hand for a hand, plus interest.

516
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,300
This is only the beginning.

517
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,780
You see my son die.

518
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,620
You will see yourself die.

519
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,020
But only with one eye.

520
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,340
This eye, or this eye?

521
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,380
Mahood, pluck out his eye.

522
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,140
Let's see if you have the guts to do it.

523
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,540
You come from a weak generation.

524
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,460
I will show you how to do it.

525
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,580
I've blinded many men.

526
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,220
But I will take only one eye from you...

527
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,300
so you can see what else happened to you.

528
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,060
Once you're dead,
I pluck out your other eye...

529
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,660
so you will be eyeless in Heaven.

530
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,980
- Hi.
- Put your hands up! Shut the door!

531
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,900
Shut the fucking door!

532
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,900
Kill her.

533
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,500
Now what was his name?

534
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,940
The name of the bloke
that booked the room?

535
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,460
Colin O'Brien.

536
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,580
- Hey, Dad.
- Long time no see.

537
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,460
This is Midori.

538
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,340
Hi. Nice to meet you.

539
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,740
Hi. What happened?

540
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,540
Bit of an accident.

541
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,660
Some accident.

542
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,060
Come on, let's get inside.

543
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,860
Fix him up properly.

544
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,540
You in trouble?

545
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,860
Nothing I can't handle.

546
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,740
'Cause if you are...

547
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,060
maybe I can help.

548
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,940
Just being here is help enough, mate.

549
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,380
You took all them?

550
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,020
I take them to prove I exist.

551
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,540
You see, sometimes I don't know.

552
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,180
Rembrandt did it. Painted himself a lot.

553
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,220
How is he?

554
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,740
He having rest.

555
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,700
They're beautiful.

556
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,900
Not really. They've eaten all the grass...

557
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,300
and they've taken the last water
from the dam.

558
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,060
- Why are they doing that?
- The drought.

559
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,660
I just sit here every day...

560
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,140
watch all my land blow away.

561
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:56,660
So, what are you and Colin doing out here?

562
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,980
Traveling, you know...

563
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,140
just traveling.

564
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,820
You didn't see Colin for a long time?

565
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,780
Years.

566
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,740
Not a very close family.

567
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,220
- That's not very good.
- I don't know.

568
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,340
Don't get in each other's pockets that way.

569
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,620
What about you?

570
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,660
Know him long?

571
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,020
No.

572
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,820
Not so long.

573
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,860
I ran away from my husband a few days ago.

574
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,620
What are you laughing at?

575
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,740
I forgot people did things like that.

576
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,540
You don't like me much, do you?

577
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,460
You think that's beautiful?

578
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,580
Well, I don't.

579
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,420
It's in the eyes of the beholder.

580
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,340
Some of the most beautiful birdcalls
are their cries...

581
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,820
of distress and terror.

582
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,660
No, I don't have the energy to hate anyone.

583
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,460
I wish I did.

584
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,580
- I thought you were asleep.
- I was just dozing.

585
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,580
Can't get my boots off.

586
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,700
- I'll help.
- No, that's all right.

587
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,580
Yeah, I'll help.

588
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:23,660
- Did you live here?
- When I was young.

589
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,900
There was grass everywhere then.

590
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,500
Every year, it got drier.

591
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,620
Mom was lonely.

592
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,300
She likes people. Dad, doesn't need them.

593
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,300
Lots of arguments.

594
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,900
One day, Mom just ran off with this guy
who was passing through.

595
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,340
Took me and my sister to the city.

596
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,660
Took me and my sister to the city.

597
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,980
Sydney first...

598
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,700
eventually, all the way up to Kent.

599
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,820
I've only seen Dad a couple times
since then.

600
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,900
Where is she now?

601
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,380
Mom? Up in Queensland.
With some new guy.

602
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,620
My sister's in the Philippines, though.

603
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,940
You think?

604
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,220
We're not a close family.

605
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,460
When you take this off...

606
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,700
you will have new lines and new fate.

607
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:15,860
Our fate brought us together.
Why would you want to change that?

608
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,980
I'll tell you what.

609
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,460
Let's go down south, to the coast.

610
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,100
We'll take Dad. There's a beach there.
It's wonderful.

611
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,180
I'd like that.

612
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,620
- The moon is calling.
- Waning.

613
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,260
The moon is waning.

614
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,220
The moon is waning.

615
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,540
Now I know what love is.

616
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,180
Real love is...

617
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,220
what I feel for you.

618
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,860
It's real love what I feel for you.

619
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,620
Good day.

620
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,900
Hi. Juice, no ice.

621
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,540
You should dye your hair blonde.

622
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,740
- Excuse me?
- Your people look good blonde.

623
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,900
Well, that was fucking embarrassing.

624
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,420
Have you seen her?

625
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,300
It was her.

626
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:32,260
A bit hard to see with chicken soup
in my eyes, but maybe.

627
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,580
Which way they went?

628
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,380
Jesus, that was some good stuff.

629
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,180
- Which way?
- Don't yell at me.

630
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,700
- Which way!
- Fuck you.

631
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,340
Stupid whore.

632
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,460
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

633
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,580
Beer.

634
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,300
- Beer?
- Yes. Beer, please.

635
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,900
Long way from home.

636
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,700
Japan.

637
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,020
Go on past me, you got plenty of room!

638
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,940
Well, get fucked!

639
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,500
All right, smile.

640
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,540
- Sure you won't come?
- No. You always liked the sea.

641
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,580
I wasn't as keen on it as your mother.

642
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,980
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you, Cam.

643
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,020
- Bye.
- Bye.

644
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:21,420
- Should be back in about a week.
- Son, I can wait for years.

645
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,780
- Thanks, mate.
- Take care.

646
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,180
Bye.

647
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,940
Thank you, Cam.

648
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,500
Thank you.

649
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,700
Hello?

650
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,580
"Beach."

651
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,220
I want information.

652
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,540
Where's beach?

653
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,940
Who are you?

654
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:32,100
Where is beach?

655
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,420
I said, who are you?

656
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:39,580
- My wife.
- I don't know where she is.

657
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,140
Where the sea? Where's the beach?

658
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,700
I said I don't know where she is.

659
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:53,740
You do!

660
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,020
You tell me!

661
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,980
I'll tell you.

662
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,340
I'll tell you something.

663
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,860
But I don't know if you'll understand me.

664
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,100
- What's your name?
- Yukio.

665
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:20,340
Well, there's a word. It's called karma.

666
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,540
Sort of means you can do bad
or evil for a long time.

667
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,020
But eventually,
eventually it'll catch up with you.

668
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,260
And you'll be destroyed.

669
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,180
When I was young...

670
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,220
I was a bit of a lad.

671
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,020
I did some bad things.

672
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:48,740
Ended up in jail
for almost killing my best friend.

673
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,380
He took my girlfriend from me.

674
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:57,900
I served my time.

675
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:03,460
It was bad karma, what I did.
He was my best friend.

676
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,460
Now, it's caught up with me.

677
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,300
Bad karma's this land.

678
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,900
There's been a drought here for 10 years.

679
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,740
And it'll continue until I die.

680
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,660
But you, Yukio...

681
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,300
Japan started the war against China...

682
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:32,620
then the world.

683
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,460
You lose the war. What happens?

684
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:41,900
You become a world economic power.
Unfair.

685
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:47,620
But your karma will change. Soon, Yukio...

686
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:52,940
your tiny country,
with its millions of tiny people...

687
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,980
will get the karma it deserves.

688
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:59,500
Earthquakes, tidal waves...

689
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,460
storms will destroy Japan.

690
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:08,500
It will sink below the waves and drown.
As if it never existed.

691
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,340
And you will die, Yukio.

692
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:15,860
You will get the karma you deserve,
you understand?

693
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,220
I understand.

694
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,140
This is your karma!

695
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,380
I understand!

696
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,100
You want a lift, man?

697
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,580
- That's cool.
- There's plenty of room.

698
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,740
Thank you.

699
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,580
Where you headed, friend?

700
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:00,140
Going this way, pal?

701
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,220
The beach.

702
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,420
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.

703
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:13,780
Think he's been out in the sun
too long, mate.

704
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,660
A bit down, eh?

705
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,060
I want to go to beach.

706
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,100
- The beach? You would like to see?
- Yes.

707
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,500
- Yes.
- Okay, cool.

708
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,020
Well, we'll drop you off in Porter.
That's on the way.

709
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,700
What do you want to go
to the beach for, anyway?

710
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,660
To talk to my wife.

711
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,060
Ain't been married long, eh?

712
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:44,460
- What's "B and S Ball"?
- It's a dance for bachelors and spinsters.

713
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,980
Is it a dance place
where you can wear good clothes?

714
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,380
Yeah. Sunday best for the B and S.

715
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,020
Hi. It's $25 each, thanks.

716
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,740
Won't be a bachelor for long.

717
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:36,060
- Last of our money.
- This is worth it.

718
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,780
Before some spinster
won't let you ask me.

719
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,860
Bachelor and spinster.

720
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,820
Two beers. Thanks, mate.

721
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,020
- May I have this dance?
- Yes.

722
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:54,180
I'm a spinster tonight.

723
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,700
Porter.

724
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,140
No man. We're not going there.

725
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,500
Porter!

726
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,060
We haven't danced yet.

727
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,940
You'd kill me?

728
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,260
I love you.

729
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,980
You don't know what love is.

730
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,340
Wait... wait...

731
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,380
I have no time.

732
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,620
Colin!

733
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,020
Why here?

734
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,820
It's the coldest place in town.

735
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:34,220
- All the witnesses saw her do it?
- Yeah. Then she and the guy headed south.

736
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,420
- And what's south?
- The ocean.

737
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,140
You'll be okay, darling.

738
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,660
- Tell me.
- Tell you?

739
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,300
Tell me about the beach.

740
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:56,620
About the beach.

741
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,460
This is the first beach I ever went to...

742
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:04,740
with my mom and dad and my sister.

743
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:13,180
I didn't know it was gonna be so big.

744
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,500
Just went on and on.

745
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:22,100
The horizon made me happy.

746
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,740
Happy?

747
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,420
It meant there are other places to go.

748
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,940
Places I didn't know anything about.

749
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,380
Beach makes things better.

750
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:50,180
Fixes things. You wait.

751
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,700
Concentrate.

752
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,220
Left.

753
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,420
I feel very cold.
