1
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,420
- Nick.
- What?

2
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,295
- Come on.
- Hold a sec.

3
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,464
Look at this.

4
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,231
Strange, isn't it?

5
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,401
- Strange, isn't it?
- Sorry, I did it accidentaly.

6
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,369
I'm so sorry.

7
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:58,417
This strange place is no longer inhabited.

8
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:03,387
Rumor said that this place was a murder scene.

9
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:09,422
Hey, how do you know?

10
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,491
The news is already widespread.

11
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,365
I don't know.

12
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,366
Shit.

13
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:30,305
Okay, okay, I relented.
This is for you.

14
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,302
What is it?

15
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,340
What do you want?

16
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,518
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't mean to.

17
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,225
Who did that?

18
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,227
- Not me.
- He said it was you.

19
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,452
Fuck.

20
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,280
Hey, don't be scared!

21
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,424
Hey, wait!

22
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,421
Don't run! Wait for me!

23
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:55,433
What will happen after that?

24
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,496
Just get there alone.

25
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,495
Sorry.

26
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:06,311
Hello? I don't have time.

27
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:14,251
It's like that, not like the others.
Okay, okay, I understand.

28
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,414
You better wait until I give the news.

29
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,395
- What does he want?
- How do I know?

30
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,293
- I know.
- Why didn't you say anything.

31
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,457
Come quick.

32
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:35,373
He always like that, always full of himself.

33
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,245
I can't stand him anymore.

34
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:45,245
If you can't stand anymore, forget it.

35
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,342
It's not that easy.

36
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,451
What you ladies know about it?

37
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:03,327
I just want to know the record goes.

38
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,431
But everything isn't according to plan.

39
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,507
You're not tired?

40
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:24,518
- Don't disturb me now.
- I disturb you?

41
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,456
- You don't like it?
- So what?

42
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:37,401
Listen, I'm so....

43
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,407
What would you say?

44
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,445
Don't, I want to go to the toilet.

45
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,247
Don't stay long.

46
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,405
What's wrong with you?

47
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,409
What?

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,248
What are you talking about?

49
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,289
Don't be like that.

50
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,337
- I don't trust you anymore.
- What else?

51
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,435
You said you'd keep your promise.
But you're not.

52
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,439
It's not like that.

53
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,430
Crazy!

54
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,350
What's that? What?

55
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,258
Hey, hey.

56
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,368
Hey, you're famous.
You are so famous.

57
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,297
- What happened?
- What did I say yesterday.

58
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,277
Hey, all thanks to my idea, isn't it?

59
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,477
Indeed, but not entirely your idea.

60
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,510
- Hey, Ghostland offers us someting.
- What?

61
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:13,482
- What offer?
- Check the offer first.

62
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,287
Indeed, it will definitely work
for us all.

63
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,266
What do you mean?

64
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,427
- About it.
- You listen to it.

65
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,499
Hello?

66
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,308
Alright.

67
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,406
Okay.

68
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,444
Yes! Yes!

69
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,447
- What is it?
- Maybe he has something.

70
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,216
Why do you look so happy?
Did you win a lottery?

71
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,491
- What If I really did?
- Don't need to be like that.

72
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,268
- There'll be a lot?
- Lots.

73
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,333
What can I do for you?

74
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:09,345
Sir, the issue is very important.

75
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:20,221
Well, if it's like that. I'll try.

76
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,260
Okay? Do your best.

77
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,427
- Okay, okay, okay.
- How?

78
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,368
- That's what I said, right?
- True.

79
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,444
Actually, not like this.

80
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,279
But it's very risky.

81
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,450
Sorry?

82
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:04,427
Actually, it is very appropriate concept.
Just not the same.

83
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,296
Honestly...

84
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,507
- Dangerous.
- What project do you mean?

85
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,449
A project. 
Hajima project.

86
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:34,266
It happened in Nagasaki.
Does anyone know where Nagasaki is?

87
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,234
Don't explain it halfway.

88
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,464
Do you want to know?

89
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,295
It exists in Japan. Do you know?

90
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,368
I've never been to Japan.

91
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,466
So what?

92
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,366
- What does it mean?
- How did you get there?

93
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,542
You need to cost a lot. Lots.

94
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,362
- Seth.
- What?

95
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:47,431
You know, we need his approval.

96
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,376
- No problem, it's an easy matter.
- Really?

97
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,374
Don't you ask for the money later?

98
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,417
I won't, this time definitely so.

99
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,285
What about you?
Will you go there?

100
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,495
We'll talk more later.

101
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:22,431
This problem can be discussed later.

102
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,439
Please think about this again. Alright.

103
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,523
- What? Are you going?
- So what?

104
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,303
You don't have to worry like that.

105
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,305
The project is very dangerous.

106
00:12:55,441 --> 00:13:00,242
But the project is far away to Japan.

107
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,305
But that's not the real problem.

108
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,252
- What is the real problem?
- What?

109
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,413
Don't you know?

110
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,524
You all know, money issues.

111
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,328
- Not a problem.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

112
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,293
Why?

113
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,366
- Tong?
- Okay, okay, okay.

114
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,231
- Yes.
- The others?

115
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:28,339
- Excellent.
- All right, we'll go.

116
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,458
- What are you doing?
- Why did you?

117
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:57,293
Actually it's not a big deal, isn't it? You can do it.

118
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,405
Actually it's not a big deal for him.

119
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,476
Hey, Ken, how about you?

120
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,275
He would agree anyway.

121
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,272
What will be approved?

122
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:18,252
You know why, you'll know.

123
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:29,460
- What are you thinking?
- What? Nothing.

124
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,305
Come on.

125
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,482
Actually... I...

126
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:51,314
- Shit, I could actually get it.
- It's all your fault.

127
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,525
Let's toast!

128
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:16,412
He want to say something to me
but he didn't dare.

129
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:23,216
- You don't need to be afraid.
- Hey, what are you talking about?

130
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,482
What is it?

131
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,327
It's okay, just a small problem.

132
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,396
Hey, you don't need to be such a smartass.

133
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,437
You'll see. I'll avenge.

134
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,340
We'll go to Japan.

135
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:50,438
That's right, in Japan,
There's a lot of fun there and Sato-san will pick you up.

136
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,375
Are you ready?

137
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:58,422
No, no, not like that.

138
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,424
Ah, this is fun.

139
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,514
- What's up?
- Good.

140
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:36,352
Hello, sir. we've arrived here safely.

141
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:42,263
You will be accompanied by Sato-san there.

142
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,494
Alright. Everyone follow me.

143
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,384
How are you all?

144
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,312
I'll be your guide here.

145
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:11,419
- Oh, you're not Japanese?
- Oh, you're not Japanese, aren't you?

146
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,266
Of course, none others.

147
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:26,274
Sato-san, how long we'll get to Hajima?

148
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:32,280
It's not far to Hajima.
only a few hours from here.

149
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:43,421
You should withstand this long trip
You shouldn't be separated from each other.

150
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:55,330
Sato. Sato-san, is it still far?

151
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,534
Yeah, how long will this last?

152
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:04,449
What's wrong with you?
Relax, chill out a bit.

153
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,280
It won't be much longer.

154
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,216
Understood, sir.

155
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,457
Listen, listen, she's like that (grumbler).

156
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,521
Alright.

157
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,502
Towards Nagasaki!

158
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,397
Excellent!

159
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,227
Sato.

160
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,522
- Where is the restroom?
- Oh. There, right there.

161
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,399
Wait a minute.

162
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,338
Don't piss carelessly.

163
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,501
I would ask people.

164
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,417
Yes, yes!

165
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,322
That's the goal. Winner.

166
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:31,454
- That was a good kick.
- Yeah, don't watch it.

167
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:36,257
I like a good team,
because they surely win.

168
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,496
- You'll see.
- Sure?

169
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,353
- Take it easy buddy, take it easy.
- Yeah.

170
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,233
Earthquake is definitely frequent here.

171
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,494
I think because it's close to the mountain.

172
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,432
Never mind.

173
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:46,303
- This is the hotel you are staying.
- Pretty good.

174
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:51,274
- Of course, a direct view to the mountain.
- Mountain?

175
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,244
What's that boat for?

176
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,376
- For the fishermen.
- Is there any nightclubs here?

177
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:04,286
No, there isn't. This is remote island.

178
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,360
This island also has many cemeteries.

179
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,428
Follow me.

180
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,457
Hey...

181
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:20,235
Why we're on vacation in a mountain full of graveyard?
It's not cool at all.

182
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,341
We'll find a pleasant place here.

183
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:28,277
- Then, see you later.
- Yes, see you later.

184
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,248
- Be careful.
- Yes, goodbye.

185
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,485
I go.

186
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,317
Come on.

187
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,380
- Excuse me.
- Welcome.

188
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,290
Come on.

189
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:50,267
- We are going to the toilet. You're coming with me.
- Yes, watch my stuff.

190
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,234
Yes.

191
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,464
Wait.
Me too.

192
00:22:54,539 --> 00:23:00,444
- I'm going to the toilet.
- Hey, don't run away.

193
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,251
This is really troublesome.

194
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,421
Look, a beautiful woman,

195
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,371
She was beautiful.

196
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,233
She's beautiful but a bit strange.

197
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,438
What is it? She's amazing.

198
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,512
I know, she's beautiful.

199
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,281
It's heavy.

200
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,246
Hold a little while.

201
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,392
Like a bad omen.

202
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:22,274
You're scaring me!

203
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,440
Sorry.

204
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,218
What are you doing?
Can I see?

205
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,345
Where did you take pictures?

206
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:36,426
Oh, beautiful. Keep on, keep on.

207
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,463
I feel something bad here.

208
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:45,470
- I don't like this palce. What do you feel?
- What I feel?

209
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,462
Something..

210
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,310
I don't feel anything.

211
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,313
Come on.

212
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,433
Stay with me.

213
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:35,241
I want you here with me forever!

214
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:43,446
You must be with me forever!
I want you! I won't let you go.

215
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,422
Never!
Let you go!

216
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:32,286
How dare you disturb me!

217
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,446
Sorry to keep you waiting.

218
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,390
- All right, let's go.
- There's no time.

219
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,394
- Yeah, come on.
- Let's go.

220
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,262
- Well, well, well.
- Hey, hey, hey.

221
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,463
You see that photo there.

222
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,411
Looks like the women we saw yesterday.

223
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:05,221
You're dreaming a lot,
it could be her daughter.

224
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,417
You must be scared.

225
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:13,294
- You must be scared. Sato-san, here.
- Don't joking around. Never mind.

226
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,229
Please, please, please!

227
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,427
Ask him who's the person in the photo there.

228
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,266
Who is it, on that photograph there?

229
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:29,279
She was the wife of the owner of this building,
died during the earthquake.

230
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:37,254
Her name is Miko-san. She was the wife of the owner
of this building who died here.

231
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:40,255
It's weird.

232
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:45,428
Sato-san, it's weird, we saw
a woman just like her here.

233
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:51,435
Only few people stay on this place. 
And there aren't many Japanese here.

234
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:58,408
Sato-san, I saw her.
I don't know.

235
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:09,216
- Miko buried here as well.
- Miko is a strong woman with a child Keiko.

236
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,256
I convince Miko to build this inn.

237
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:25,395
Miko was sick and couldn't get up from the bed.
So, she's always stay in her room.

238
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:43,311
- The sea is beautiful!
- The cruise is wonderful.

239
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:47,256
We never thought that there will be a happy beginning.

240
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:51,386
On our creepy trip.

241
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:55,398
It's for our memories.

242
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,397
Be careful.

243
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,347
Here, let me help.

244
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:30,483
Look.

245
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,430
Old buildings.

246
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,359
Come on.

247
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,232
Look at that.

248
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,512
Let's go, come here.

249
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,480
- Put all the stuff here.
- Ok.

250
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:59,280
- Hey, wait for me, I'm coming.
- Yes, I'm just around here.

251
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,451
You're here, coward.

252
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,259
This is really terrible.

253
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,372
It's a great place.

254
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:53,307
Hey guys, read it.

255
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:58,246
Read it... Sex place..
Wow this is a great place.

256
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,351
Hold a sec.

257
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,378
It was a settlement,
many people were falling from above,

258
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:40,514
When an earthquake occured, due to mass panic.

259
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:49,460
- They were encouraging each other to jump.
- Yeah, so a lot of people die here.

260
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:55,331
- Isn't it?
- No, no. Lower your voice.

261
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:00,408
- Sato, Sato, take it easy, we're just recording.
- I'm sorry.

262
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,379
Relax?

263
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,342
- Here we go again.
- Yeah, come on. 3, 2, 1.

264
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:13,288
Let him do the talking.

265
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,464
Yes, wait a minute.

266
00:38:54,532 --> 00:39:00,528
- Don't go in there.
- It's okay. Wait for us here.

267
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:05,375
Okay, time for us to investigate.

268
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,508
Hey, you.

269
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:21,222
- Is this? Is this all?
- Yes, I've been walking here.

270
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,398
What?

271
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:34,269
What is it exactly?

272
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,469
Only this?

273
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:55,385
It's very fun.

274
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,421
There's something I need to tell you?

275
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,499
But I don't know what is it.

276
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,269
And that too?

277
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,382
All of it.

278
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,380
Is that it?

279
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:50,473
Give me like that, you already understand.

280
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:43,365
I'm very mad with you.

281
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,435
- Off?
- What?

282
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,494
What are you doing?

283
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:52,364
Nothing, I just want to write my name here.

284
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,477
Are we here for that?

285
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,406
Yeah, I know.

286
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,263
Damn it all.

287
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,339
What's this?

288
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,340
Ah.

289
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:34,409
- Are you done yet?
- Yes, but we still want to go again.

290
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,420
Why they're here?

291
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,448
Alright.

292
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,456
Aren't you scared? Let's stop all of this.
Goodbye to you all.

293
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:54,235
Only this?

294
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:32,365
This place hasn't been occupied for a long time.
Sato-san said that as long as we don't disturb them then it's okay.

295
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,210
Is that so?

296
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:57,266
We men go first, you follow us from behind.

297
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,302
Yes.

298
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:06,436
So what are we gonna do?

299
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,243
So, what are "they" look like?

300
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,512
So, are we together with "them" here?

301
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,221
So, what makes you like them?

302
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,290
What's wrong?

303
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,489
So we'll run again?

304
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:29,423
So what are you doing so far?

305
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:35,464
I already feel like it.

306
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:42,471
- What do you feel?
- Nothing at all.

307
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,383
yeah, I never feel.

308
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:02,261
- What are you doing?
- I'm spining it.

309
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,337
Thank you.

310
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:15,276
- Useless.
- All right.

311
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,288
What's wrong?

312
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:50,439
I'm here, what do you want?

313
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:07,330
So, what did they say to you?

314
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:37,255
I'm scared.

315
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,298
There is...

316
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,327
Look at this.

317
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,340
It's quiet here, nothing strange.

318
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:05,276
What is it?

319
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:12,278
What happened there?

320
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:18,361
I'm so scared, hey, what is it?

321
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,487
Let's get out of here.

322
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,239
Hey.

323
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:57,231
This is all.

324
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:13,247
We've been investigating this, so what
else do we need to know?

325
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,206
I already feel like they're here.

326
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:25,284
I understand what you mean,
So what you want to say?

327
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,330
So you already found.

328
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,387
All of "them"?

329
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,398
Sato-san, do you think we're here to have fun?

330
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:02,287
Maybe when we get there, we'll meet them.

331
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,392
Hey, stick around.

332
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:27,248
Maybe if you investigate it, you'll know,
and you'll like it.

333
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,356
Are they here?

334
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,362
- Yes
- Did you break it?

335
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:21,396
- Why are you here?
- Yes, I understand.

336
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:29,507
- Careful, we don't know what happened here?
- Yeah, I know already.

337
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:36,411
How many times I told you that they're here?

338
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:47,328
Like this?

339
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:53,231
Can you walk?

340
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:59,339
So, we have to approach them?

341
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,443
What if they're approaching you?

342
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:06,408
Have you ever heard their voices?

343
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,312
What for?

344
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,441
Are we done? let's go to other places?

345
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,506
Excuse me.

346
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:49,282
So they already know we're here.

347
00:53:54,397 --> 00:54:01,428
I can't understand you anymore, I'm the worst.

348
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:06,537
Imagine if you're here, I can't imagine that.

349
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:14,509
Impossible.

350
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,491
I have no idea.

351
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,439
- Don't ever do...
- Yes, I understand.

352
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:29,481
Hurry, it's going to fall.

353
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,495
Come on, hurry!

354
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:02,316
Hey, do you want to save them?

355
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:20,275
Hey you guys...

356
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:27,472
- Hey...
- Why do you come here?

357
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,270
No!

358
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,411
Everyone, hurry!

359
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,457
I'll have the roasted crickets.

360
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,501
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

361
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,471
Bye.

362
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,245
Let's try the roasted crickets.

363
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,426
- Disgusting.
- It's crispy.

364
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,520
- You'll be hooked.
- I don't want.

365
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:33,395
- You'll get stomachache if you eat it.
- Look how cute he is.

366
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:36,300
Enjoy your meal.

367
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,504
You're crazy.

368
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,472
- How does it taste?
- Like a chicken.

369
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:50,275
Hey May, what do you think?

370
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,485
Scary place for our next trip.

371
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:02,458
- Suitable for our project.
- After all, we've come to Japan.

372
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:04,290
We have to finish it.

373
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:12,239
- What about the equipment?
- I'll fix it tomorrow.

374
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:16,369
- I don't believe that ghosts exist.
- Don't be too sure.

375
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,244
It could appear anywhere.

376
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:23,282
- How are you all?
- Nick.

377
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:27,321
- Hey, good night.
- Good night.

378
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:31,326
- Nan, are you alright?
- I'm alright.

379
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,362
Be careful, you begin to sound like crickets.

380
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:41,360
What are you talking about?

381
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:42,495
We went to the island of Hashima.

382
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,365
Hashima Island?

383
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:50,344
The place was very creepy,
you've gone mad?

384
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,216
We must work on our college project.

385
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:59,514
What college project?
Why must go to Japan?

386
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:03,425
We want to prove that ghosts exist.

387
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,487
- Proving that ghosts exist?
- True.

388
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:17,364
If that so, why do you do a project like this? 
Is there no other way?

389
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:25,238
- It's challenging.
- Challenging? It's useless if you die.

390
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:31,286
Do you know how many people died in Hashima?

391
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,347
- We know.
- Then why did you still want to go there?

392
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:45,298
You are young, now is the time to enjoy your life,
why don't you find yourself a girlfriend?

393
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:57,244
Especially you. I say to you, 
change the project.

394
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:10,484
There were many people in Hashima at first, but
because of the war, many died and the rest left.

395
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,421
We don't plan on staying there.

396
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:18,524
I thought you guys think there is a hotel there.

397
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:28,438
Hey. I heard every night, 
there's a woman crying there.

398
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,242
Anyway, let's toast.

399
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,416
Hey! Damn.

400
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:49,526
Why are you suddenly appeared,
I thought you were a ghost.

401
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:54,392
Bad luck.

402
01:02:56,272 --> 01:03:00,402
Who are you?
I decide my own destiny.

403
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,282
Isn't that scary?

404
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,352
True.

405
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:19,226
Hey waiter. More drink.

406
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,358
- Where you going?
- The toilet.

407
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,458
I hate you!

408
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:37,338
Damn, I thought she was a ghost.

409
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,246
Damn.

410
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,368
- Ouch!
- I'm sorry.

411
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,481
- Is it safe?
- It's safe.

412
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:08,286
Don't go anywhere, I 'll be right back.

413
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:25,247
Off, open the door.
Are you there Off, open the door.

414
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,325
Help me.

415
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:55,280
Show me the video.

416
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,463
Halo.

417
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:18,469
- Nick. Everything is ready?
- Yes it is. I was going to go.

418
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:26,244
- I'll go there.
- I'll be waiting, this is creepy.

419
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,424
I told you, that ghost is following me.

420
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:35,259
- Maybe it's just your feeling.
- Many strange things have happened since we went there.

421
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,391
- I know what I saw.
- Off, We can't go before we finish the project.

422
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:43,427
Let's stop all this project.

423
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:52,244
Hey. I heard a problem, 
what happened?

424
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:56,350
I want our project is stopped.

425
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,443
Why?

426
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:04,485
- That woman ghost is following me.
- Maybe we should postpone this?

427
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:34,338
You'd better stay alert, pesky star is
following you.

428
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:32,229
Well, this special event,
let's get started.

429
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,399
Let's get started.

430
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:48,481
What do I say, I've warned you
to ensure all the works.

431
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,261
This is an important event.

432
01:13:55,531 --> 01:14:00,332
I leave!

433
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:48,267
This is just a small delay,
I'll clean it up.

434
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,502
I know it.

435
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,240
Yes.

436
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,348
We'll talk about it later.

437
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:14,260
What the hell.

438
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:21,495
What the hell.

439
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:26,433
Hey, power is lost.

440
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:27,502
Quick, turn it on!

441
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,375
Quick, turn it on now!

You belong to me.

We will live together.

446
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,411
We will be together.

447
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:22,449
Stay with me.

448
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:42,493
Please don't.

449
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,331
Off, what happened?

450
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,436
Don't bother me.

451
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:32,242
I'm worried about you.

452
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,405
Don't interfere.
It's not your problem.

Why don't you tell me?

It's not your problem. You don't need to interfere.

455
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:50,330
Better mind your own problems.
This is not your problem.

456
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,264
What's wrong with you?

457
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,238
Who do you think I am?

458
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,273
- Why?
- What?

459
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:00,365
I'm worried about you.

460
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:02,467
I told you this doesn't concern you.

461
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:03,471

It's up to you.

475
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,223
Alright.

01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:35,386
- Let go of me.
- Shut up.

485
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:37,492
Off, Off.

486
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,434

01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,499
Off, Off.

Off, do you hear it?

503
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,404
I raped her.

504
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,401
You should understand.

505
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:19,299
Off, your ring is nice as well.

506
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,423
I'll take it.

507
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,462
May, what happened?

508
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,497
What is it?

509
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:35,374
May

510
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:36,465
Who did this?

511
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,379
Tell me who did this?

512
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,377
Those who did this?

513
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:47,482
Are they that did this to you, May?

514
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:49,450
- I hate you.
- May!

515
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,402
Off.

516
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:06,398
What is it?

517
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:13,413
Why don't you say something?

518
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:23,255
Off, say something!

519
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:33,290
Why don't you say something?

520
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,298
Huh?

521
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:39,370
What do you hide?

522
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:41,442
Are you a sissy?

523
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,313
You're a man right, Off?

524
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:47,311
Huh?

525
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,214
You're a man.

526
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,410
You're a man.

527
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,390
You should beat them, Off.

528
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:58,289
Huh?

529
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:05,397
Alright.

530
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:08,402
Don't say anything, Off.

531
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:15,239
Just shut up until you die.

532
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,383
Have you seen this ring?

533
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:42,262
Nope, not at all.

534
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:49,266
He sends a message.

535
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:55,366
What did he say?

536
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:58,278
