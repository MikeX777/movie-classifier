19
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:40,534
So the tap was still running
when you found her.

20
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:44,979
Calm down.
You don't have to cry.

21
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:53,223
l'm not too sure, but l heard Mari
was going out with an American soldier.

22
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:00,896
Mari from Charade's
committed suicide.

23
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:04,628
Stupid girl.
She didn't have to kill herself.

24
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,003
Maybe she's got the "clap."

25
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,398
You can't get upset over
a minor thing

26
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,704
if you're doing business
with American soldiers.

27
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:18,215
Did you hear about the suicide
at the base school last month?

28
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:21,711
There seem to be
a lot of them lately.

29
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:25,221
Apparently, everybody's really
uptight about it.

30
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:29,224
How terrible.
l hope this doesn't affect business.

31
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:33,889
It can't be helped if we're going
to make a living off the base.

32
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,423
Huh?

33
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:41,170
It can't be helped if we're going
to make a living off the base.

34
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:30,880
Aren't you Japanese?
You are not a student here, are you?

35
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,385
Did you pass through the office?

36
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,785
Hey, hold on a second!

37
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:44,222
Where is the principal's office?

38
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,092
Huh?

39
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:32,839
<i>So, this is their "dining room"then. </i>

40
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,099
Oh, you scared me.

41
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,961
What were you doing here?

42
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:58,270
Nothing. L thought l had a headache.

43
00:15:58,376 --> 00:15:59,343
But it"s gone now.

44
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:02,109
Oh. Wait!

45
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,907
Hold on a minute!

46
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:29,875
You...

47
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,381
Hey!

48
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:06,051
Hey!

49
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:09,923
Listen to me!

50
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:12,919
Listen, just forget what you just saw.

51
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:30,446
Why... What is this...
You are...

52
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:37,151
Linda wasn"t feeling well.
She was just sleeping...

53
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,619
Linda...

54
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:40,554
Linda...

55
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:04,581
What? What is this?

56
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:06,605
Linda...

57
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:52,819
Hey, Mama-san, where"s my beer?

58
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,659
Oh, l"m sorry.

59
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,265
Excuse me. L"ll be right back.

60
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:31,435
What are you doing?

61
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:32,907
Run for it!

62
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,385
Run!

63
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:51,074
Go inside.

64
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,348
What did you just do?

65
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:03,347
What are you trying to do here?

66
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:05,185
Shut up!

67
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,926
Listen! Anyone who is
marked by "them" or

68
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:21,869
anyone who has seen "their" real form,
isn"t allowed to live.

69
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:25,802
So, we"ve got to kill "them"
before "they" get us.

70
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:29,412
What are "they"?

71
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,884
Demons. They live off human blood.

72
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:56,500
Shit! Isn"t there something?

73
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:00,701
Like what?

74
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:02,005
A weapon.

75
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:07,647
Here...

76
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,244
That won"t kill them.

77
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:12,219
They won"t die

78
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:15,189
unless they lose enough blood
in one blow.

79
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:18,285
Then what is this gun for?

80
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,657
You may need it.

81
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,896
You can kill yourself as a last resort.

82
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:33,141
Don"t!

83
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:40,650
Why me?

84
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:43,817
Who are you?

85
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:50,756
Why did you help me?

86
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:56,994
You"re lucky. L can"t kill "humans."

87
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,084
Shut up!

88
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:40,867
Wait! Don"t shoot!

89
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:20,267
l can"t take this anymore.

90
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:25,575
Don"t give up!

91
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,008
Get the car!

92
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:29,647
Run the doors down!

93
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:14,576
<i>After all, </i>
<i>l never understood what l saw. </i>

94
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:21,173
<i>That girl Saya and the creatures</i>
<i>she killed all remained a mystery. </i>

95
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:25,481
<i>Only two students were noted</i>
<i>as having left for other schools. </i>

96
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:31,215
<i>Could she still be somewhere</i>
<i>around the base? </i>

97
00:43:32,462 --> 00:43:35,761
<i>Is she still fighting those creatures? </i>

98
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:40,493
<i>Just as we humans continue</i>
<i>to kill each other. </i>

99
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:45,834
<i>That beautiful, </i>
<i>yet dangerous living thing</i>
