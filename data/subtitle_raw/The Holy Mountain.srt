1
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:15,203
THE HOLY MOUNTAIN premiered
on December 17th, 1926.

2
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:19,200
The reconstruction was based
on two nitrate copies:

3
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:22,199
A tinted version from the
Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, Berlin,

4
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:26,200
and another one in black & white from
the Fondazione Cineteca Italiana, Milan.

5
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:29,199
The intertitles were -
when available -

6
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:33,200
taken from the copy of the Bundesarchiv-
Filmarchiv or corrected electronically.

7
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:36,677
Missing titles were added with the
aid of the censor's certificate...

8
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:40,203
...from December 16th, 1926 that the
Deutsche Filminstitut...  DIF provided.

9
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,882
The restoration took place in 2001
in collaboration with...

10
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:47,880
...the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, Berlin,
the Fondazione Cineteca Italiana, Milan...

11
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:50,879
and the Friedrich Wilhelm
Murnau Foundation, Wiesbaden.

12
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,879
Lab: L'Immagine Ritrovata, Bologna

13
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:56,879
Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation

14
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:00,000
Those well-known sportsmen...

15
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:04,000
...who participated in the making of
THE HOLY MOUNTAIN...

16
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:08,000
...ask the audience not to mistake their
performances for trick photography.

17
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:13,115
All shots taken outdoors were actually
made in the mountains,

18
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:18,122
in the most beautiful parts of the Alps,
over the course of one and a half years.

19
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:21,404
The big ski race
is performed by German,

20
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:25,400
Norwegian and Austrian
master skiers.

21
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:30,845
The screenplay to this motion picture
was inspired by actual events...

22
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:37,844
...that occurred during a twenty year
period in the life of the great mountains.

23
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:41,885

PRELUDE

43
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:25,645
There, where the rock falls steeply and
defiantly into the surf... is her home...

44
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:57,319
The sea is her love, wild...
boundless...

45
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:33,997
But her life... is dance...
vibrant expressions of a stormy soul.

46
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:06,877
Diotima's Dance to the Sea.
Diotima: Dancer Leni Riefenstahl

47
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,640
And so Diotima dances... dances
to satiate her longing for him...

48
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:06,642
whom she has seen in her dreams...
atop the highest mountain peak.

49
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,476
END OF PRELUDE

50
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:04,480
TWO FRIENDS FROM THE MOUNTAINS

51
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:13,803
"The Friend"
Engineer Trenker

52
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,882
Vigo
Ernst Petersen, student of medicine

53
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,156
At the entrance to the Grand Hotel

54
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,519
DIOTIMA DANCES THIS EVENING
IN THE GRAND HOTEL

55
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:56,998
And Diotima dances in the country
of her desire.

56
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,680
DANCE TO THE SEA -
DREAMBLOSSOM - DEVOTION

57
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:30,804
DREAMBLOSSOM

58
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:08,161
She seems... almost holy!

59
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,322
Were any people from
the mountains here?

60
00:17:56,407 --> 00:18:02,039
Did you see my dance?...

61
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,242
What did you enjoy most?

62
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:56,036
The friend rushes upward,

63
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:01,042
high into the mountains, to savor
his overwhelming experience.

64
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,797
DIOTIMA'S ASCENT

65
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:32,556
A jubilant spring climbs
higher up the mountain.

66
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:37,562
And a joyous Diotima
immerses herself in it.

67
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:27,682
Just then, "the Friend" begins
his lonely descent...

68
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:31,686
...from the icy brow
of the tallest peak.

69
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,525
In an alpine meadow.

70
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:34,884
The mountainside reveals nature's
ferocious power.

71
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:44,241
The imposing pinnacle of the
highest mountain rises before her.

72
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:03,402
The meeting.

73
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,198
Did you come from up there?

74
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:11,920
It must be beautiful there.

75
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,526
Beautiful... arduous... dangerous

76
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:31,675
What does one search for, up there?

77
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:39,485
One's self.

78
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:50,159
And nothing else?

79
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:58,680
And what are you searching for,
up here... in nature?

80
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:11,357
Beauty!

81
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:24,446
And nothing else?

82
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:44,887
AT HIS HOME

83
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:49,358
AT HIS HOME

84
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:26,122
Today I climb in search of the most
beautiful mountain that exists.

85
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:28,723
And tomorrow?

86
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:37,319
Tomorrow we will celebrate our engagement
together... very high up there.

87
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:47,957
You seek Gods... but it's people
you must find.

88
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:31,321
I suppose you came all this way just
to see me, not the ski race.

89
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:38,758
Look for me at the jumping contest!

90
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:18,444
He wants to go up there again...
without me.

91
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:31,525
Take me with you one time - into
your world... really high up...

92
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:38,483
At least up to the cottage.

93
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:12,121
"The Sea and the Stone
can Never Be Wed."

94
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:30,160
Winter, still draped
across his mountain.

95
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:09,484
Look... those enormous rocks
have been worn away...

96
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,479
...by the gigantic force of water,
in nature's eternal cycle.

97
00:36:54,127 --> 00:37:01,238
And all the debris left by these mighty
waters... they are our mountains.

98
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:11,759
Why is nature so beautiful to us?

99
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:20,486
Because we invest
our very souls in it.

100
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:29,480
You, too, are like nature.

101
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,160
And that's why I love you so much.

102
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:53,607
The bustle of winter sports.

103
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,440
The bustle of winter sports.

104
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,564
The mountain guide
Hannes Schneider

105
00:38:56,647 --> 00:39:00,526
Have you finished marking
the race route?

106
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:09,118
How's the competition looking?

107
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:15,557
You'll probably be beaten.

108
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,246
By whom?

109
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:23,795
Colli... the shepherd.

110
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:26,483
Never.

111
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:31,720
Colli
Friedrich Schneider

112
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:44,046
Say, if your Friend
doesn't participate,

113
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:48,040
there'll be no competition
in the long-distance run.

114
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:24,403
Take me with you!

115
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:29,880
What's wrong with you, darling?

116
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:34,401
FEAR!

117
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:44,483
I will be back in time
for your dance tonight.

118
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:57,683
Goodbye... until tonight!

119
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:08,362
The jumping event has begun.

120
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:52,356
Diotima goes to watch the ski jump.

121
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:19,316
Colli prepares for the his final jump.

122
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:07,315
In wonderful style,
Vigo determines the winner.

123
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:48,839
The young victor.

124
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:05,598
But far away from the sporting bustle,
the Friend...

125
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:10,203
...seeking the most beautiful mountain
- for tomorrow...

126
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,639
I'm not sure I can ride
such a steep hill.

127
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:22,238
Now where would my beautiful,
gentle Madonna like to go?

128
00:45:46,967 --> 00:45:50,755
Wild and fantastic,
like a gothic cathedral,

129
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:54,760
rises from its mighty foundation...

130
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,676
- the most beautiful mountain.

131
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,882
THE LONG-DISTANCE RUN

132
00:46:27,207 --> 00:46:33,043
Come back the winner,
and I'll grant you a wish.

133
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:39,999
The route is marked.

134
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:01,802
High atop his silent world.

135
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:47,164
Colli fights for the lead.

136
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:28,404
Colli leads.

137
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:21,757
75 miles per hour on skis!

138
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:36,640
Relentlessly pursuing Colli.

139
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:51,484
Vigo closes the gap!

140
00:49:56,687 --> 00:49:57,756
Overtakes!

141
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:17,526
Vigo in the lead.

142
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,563
Colli far behind.

143
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:13,117
Vigo still leads.

144
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:29,803
The others continue
the wild chase.

145
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:53,004
The two favorites find themselves
far behind.

146
00:52:05,607 --> 00:52:09,919
Don't give up, we're nearly the last!

147
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:16,720
Racing through the forest,

148
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:21,722
they no longer notice the fairy tale
beauty of the snow-covered firs.

149
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:03,876
Pushing for the lead.

150
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:41,798
Colli goes wrong

151
00:53:50,607 --> 00:53:51,960
All wrong!

152
00:53:58,087 --> 00:54:00,203
The end of the fight.

153
00:54:57,247 --> 00:54:59,920
Just before the finish.

154
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:41,200
I'll get you yet!

155
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:18,886
Vigo...  Vigo!

156
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:53,878
He begins his descent
into the valley.

157
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,800
May I have my wish now?

158
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:36,477
And what does the victor desire?

159
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:39,436
THE DREADFUL NORTH FACE

160
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:08,196
ABYSS!

161
00:59:22,887 --> 00:59:23,922
ABYSS!

162
00:59:46,807 --> 00:59:53,645
When he comes home today,
I have a surprise for him.

163
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:04,836
A new dance...
A hymn of Joy

164
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:59,558
I really think... she loves me.

165
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:26,197
Well, finally you appear!

166
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:34,319
Come with me, I need you.

167
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:41,646
We must scale
the Santo-north face.

168
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:48,363
Now?  In winter?
Are you mad?

169
01:01:51,047 --> 01:01:57,759
You're my best friend.  Come with me.
We'll be mad together.

170
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:04,925
I'll come get you.

171
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:34,719
I must go away...
with a friend of mine.

172
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:42,521
- A magnificent man,
whom you should meet sometime.

173
01:02:57,967 --> 01:03:04,566
The ski racers go to the cottage,
to celebrate the day's events.

174
01:03:28,247 --> 01:03:29,919
What has come over you?

175
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:37,604
Sorry, Vigo.  It's not you.
But please do not ask.

176
01:03:42,647 --> 01:03:44,797
To the north face of the mountain.

177
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:33,241
Before the dreadful Santo-north face.

178
01:05:03,727 --> 01:05:08,881
Are you afraid to come with me?

179
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:45,883
Look, we should turn back.
The Foehn wind is coming down.

180
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:55,483
Let it come... the stronger the better!

181
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:59,477
And let storm and avalanche roar
their wild songs with it.

182
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:23,484
The very walls come alive
with the flow of the avalanches.

183
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:25,677
It comes boiling up from the valleys
in a terrible tempest.

184
01:13:36,807 --> 01:13:38,007
TURMOIL!

185
01:13:38,007 --> 01:13:43,286
TURMOIL!

186
01:13:51,847 --> 01:13:57,763
Something must have
happened to him!

187
01:14:49,327 --> 01:14:53,684
Snap out of it!
Do you hear me?

188
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:29,282
You really are mad!
Take me back down again!

189
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:38,285
Is there something you desire...
down there... among the rabble?

190
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:47,247
A dancer...

191
01:15:52,407 --> 01:15:53,283
- Diotima

192
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:58,964
It was you!

193
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:16,123
VIGO!

194
01:16:17,927 --> 01:16:24,275
And Diotima must dance...
her hymn of joy.

195
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:56,442
I can't fasten you to anything!
It's all ice!

196
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:49,121
Vigo...  I'd never do anything
to harm you!

197
01:19:07,287 --> 01:19:12,315
I've gone with Vigo to conquer
the Santo-north face

198
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:40,003
I can dance no more!

199
01:19:48,887 --> 01:19:53,677
You cannot just walk out in
the middle of a performance.

200
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:49,358
Our ski-master and his friend Vigo...

201
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:57,006
- have not returned
from the Santo-north face.

202
01:22:08,367 --> 01:22:14,681
Are there mountaineers among you...?
Men who would climb up,

203
01:22:14,767 --> 01:22:19,682
through this night, up to Sella cottage,
to alert the skiers?

204
01:22:32,087 --> 01:22:33,964
Who among you will climb?

205
01:22:40,687 --> 01:22:41,563
For my sake?

206
01:23:31,447 --> 01:23:32,880
Was one man not enough for you?

207
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:58,880
Vigo...?  He is but a child!

208
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:14,639
They're all... children.

209
01:24:41,807 --> 01:24:48,918
I am climbing up to the cottage.
I will find the way.

210
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:17,160
But no single man has the strength
to lift a body from an overhang.

211
01:25:17,247 --> 01:25:21,160
Sacrificing the comrade -
perhaps one's self with him -

212
01:25:21,247 --> 01:25:25,160
the greatest dilemma of the mountains.

213
01:25:26,447 --> 01:25:31,521
THE DEED

214
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:37,164
We drink to the welfare
of our absent ski-master.

215
01:27:36,447 --> 01:27:37,243
Nature unleashed!

216
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:36,440
Cut me free...
I can't bear it anymore.

217
01:28:46,047 --> 01:28:47,924
At least save yourself!

218
01:29:38,447 --> 01:29:41,120
Why... why?

219
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:30,998
How to we reach Mount Santo?

220
01:30:36,567 --> 01:30:46,602
First down to the forest... then
over the bridge and up again.

221
01:33:33,687 --> 01:33:36,724
Have you found the bridge?

222
01:34:00,727 --> 01:34:02,638
Losing faith

223
01:35:01,527 --> 01:35:03,722
Why?

224
01:35:19,007 --> 01:35:22,761
HIS WORLD

225
01:38:54,927 --> 01:39:00,399
And with the last of his strength,
he holds his friend, long since frozen.

226
01:39:25,887 --> 01:39:32,804
Dawn breaks upon
his tormented soul.

227
01:41:30,007 --> 01:41:34,364
A peaceful calm settles upon the frozen
world, and upon the soul of Diotima,

228
01:41:34,447 --> 01:41:38,360
who at last learns the fate
of her beloved.

229
01:42:30,487 --> 01:42:31,556
Fallen!

230
01:42:41,807 --> 01:42:44,719
He has fallen!

231
01:42:54,887 --> 01:43:04,717
He held onto his fallen friend the whole
night, and thus sacrificed himself.

232
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:20,638
Among us, the greatest attribute...
is loyalty.

233
01:43:47,727 --> 01:43:51,037
Peace lies upon the eternal sea...
silently it spreads,

234
01:43:51,127 --> 01:43:55,040
rolling out in broad waves, to soothe
the world's suffering and strife.

235
01:44:43,007 --> 01:44:46,761
Above it all looms a Holy Mountain...

236
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:50,760
a symbol of the greatest values
than humanity can embrace...

237
01:44:52,247 --> 01:44:56,035
fidelity... truth... loyalty...  FAITH

238
01:44:59,407 --> 01:45:02,797
