00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,198
A film by Ildik¨® Enyedi

2
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:08,076
Simon the Magician

3
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,118
Music:

4
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:28,125
Director of photography:

5
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:31,516
Written and directed by:

6
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,884
I'll tell you an old story.

7
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:37,396
1998, Paris. We barely remember
what it was like.

8
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:39,876
The end of something, but not yet
the beginning of anything.

9
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,396
Like ancient Rome around 100 BC,
to where Simon Mágus arrived,

10
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,682
from some far corner of the empire...

11
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,719
Yes?

12
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,718
Shot...

13
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,198
Why me?

14
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:25,596
Okay, fine.
100 thousand franks.

15
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,597
No.
100 thousand.

16
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:46,117
No planes.
Train. I'll take the train.

17
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,596
Look at me when
I'm talking to you!

18
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,798
Take your stuff,
and piss off!

19
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:41,001
Hey, are you listening?

20
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,723
Get it?

21
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:25,719
- Are you well?
- Yes and you?

22
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry, what just happened?

23
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,119
No, believe me,
I was there the whole time.

24
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,719
I talked to the conductor too.

25
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:51,798
I have no idea.

26
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:55,602
Maybe he missed
the train and is still in Budapest,

27
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,525
having breakfast somewhere.

28
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:02,000
Why, what else
could I have done?

29
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:09,325
They didn't tell me it
would be this cold in Paris.

30
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,397
All is well,
he's arrived!

31
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,723
Good afternoon! Oh,
I'm so glad you found me.

32
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:17,641
I'm Liza,
good day!

33
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:20,446
Please get in!
I'll take you to your hotel.

34
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,922
Then we have to
go see the commissioner.

35
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:31,036
- I've already got a room.
- Oh, but this is a very elegant hotel.

36
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,715
That doesn't matter.
This will do for me.

37
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,118
My staff is leading the
investigation...

38
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:47,525
and they are very
pleased you are here.

39
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,318
They will help any way
they can.

40
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,524
The pressure is building.

41
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,122
We have to produce results.

42
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,646
Of course we have
French psychics.

43
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,116
We are in contact with
a few soothsayers.

44
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:08,921
But they haven't
gotten anywhere in the case.

45
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,722
As to confidentiality...

46
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,436
it's an issue of
professional prestige.

47
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,436
None of this is public...

48
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:27,844
so I would ask
for discretion.

49
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:36,718
That's all.

50
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:40,118
He thanks you.

51
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,558
Do you need anything?

52
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,558
The money in advance.

53
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:59,238
He'll write a check.

54
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,238
I'd like cash.

55
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,437
They say it
can be arranged.

56
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,558
Did you travel well?

57
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,143
The placement of the corpse,
points to violence...

58
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:12,038
The approximate time of death...

59
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,638
Liza dear!

60
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,161
I need to work alone.

61
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:33,446
Please understand,
the master needs to work alone.

62
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,758
Of course.

63
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,358
We are leaving.

64
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,838
And you dear?

65
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,638
I'm eating cake.

66
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,359
Really?
Put it down!

67
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,158
You're not allowed.

68
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:08,638
Right, right,
down, down.

69
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:11,038
Yes.

70
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:19,042
Would you please...
leave with the others?

71
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,038
Me?

72
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:26,884
Yes, yes.

73
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,561
I'm going.
Excuse me.

74
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:09,678
Can you hear anything?

75
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,279
- He must be concentrating.
- He better be.

76
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,881
He has about as much chance
of finding the killer,

77
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:23,561
as me finding water
with this key chain.

78
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,559
Do you have
a pack of cards?

79
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:09,566
I'll write the report
if you go to the bakery.

80
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:14,557
I'm bored to death!

81
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,078
Bring beer instead!

82
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,683
He wasn't quick
about it.

83
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,281
Liza my dear!
Tell them,

84
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:47,677
to bring a micro voltmeter
and an Oscilloscope.

85
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,759
- Okay. - Oh, and a biologist,
he'll know what he needs to do.

86
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,958
- What did he say?
- Can we go in?

87
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,078
One sec!
Come here!

88
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,281
He needs a micro voltmeter.

89
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,358
Call a biologist!

90
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,159
What's this?

91
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:16,486
With this we can measure
the energy of the plant.

92
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,805
First we put gelatine
on the leaf,

93
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:24,482
then we place the
electrode on it,

94
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,996
which we connect to
the oscilloscope,

95
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:29,806
and it shows on the monitor,

96
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:33,277
the changes in the
feelings of the plant.

97
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,398
- The plants energy?
- Exactly.

98
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:38,877
By examining the state of
the plant we can conclude,

99
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,885
what the plant felt.

100
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:54,206
- He wants to ask something.
- Go ahead!

101
00:19:56,687 --> 00:20:00,282
- He's interested in your method.
- Why? He doesn't understand?

102
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:06,882
No method.
No magic.

103
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:12,681
The plant has
been well taken care of.

104
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:19,678
It's owner must have loved it,
and it hurt the plant, to lose him.

105
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:25,231
Yes but he still doesn't understand.

106
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:28,401
If we show it the killer,
it will recognize him.

107
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,479
I'll turn on the machine.

108
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,802
Put the wire on the leaf.

109
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:36,196
The gelatine will
be the conductor.

110
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:41,281
The receiver
is on the leaf...

111
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,285
everything is ready...

112
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:49,885
Careful!
Don't touch the plant!

113
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,998
Watch the monitor.

114
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,118
I've had enough.

115
00:20:55,927 --> 00:21:00,318
- So now what do we do? - Round up
all the people who knew him.

116
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:06,201
- All of them?
- No just the left handed ones.

117
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:09,598
Hold on, I'll show
you something!

118
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:12,598
See my lighter.

119
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:20,325
I'll put the flame closer
and watch the difference!

120
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:24,121
The curves go higher.

121
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:28,522
Pull it away,
they lower.

122
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:31,201
Closer, higher.

123
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:33,318
Okay, but...

124
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:37,320
If the killer is in the room,

125
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:40,319
the curves will
change.

126
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:42,740
Is this a trustworthy method?

127
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,401
Yes. Though it's never
been used in crime solving.

128
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,918
Let's go a little closer!

129
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:25,998
Yes, that's him.

130
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,118
He's gotten older.

131
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,718
Careful, slower!

132
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:37,726
I don't want him
to see me yet.

133
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:45,398
You see, this man is
my only adversary.

134
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:48,041
If he's still in shape.

135
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:51,238
We'll see.

136
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:53,918
Put some music on.

137
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:56,842
That's good.

138
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:59,919
Now you can go closer.

139
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,318
Well... well...

140
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:13,046
Oh!
Good evening!

141
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:16,044
Get in!

142
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,524
No, no.
I'll walk.

143
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:23,641
Don't insult me! Now that
we ran into each other...

144
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,718
Let's talk!

145
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:31,237
No, no, no! I just
need a little air.

146
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:36,123
Tell me honestly: when you
saw me, did your recognise me?

147
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:40,035
- What?
- I haven't changed too much?

148
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:42,438
Sorry, I didn't hear
you well!

149
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,916
- I asked if you knew me?
- Oh, yeah of course.

150
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:49,042
Get in!
Don't make me beg!

151
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,238
That's a nice car.

152
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,124
No, no... really.

153
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,117
It looks good.

154
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:04,761
That's it?
It looks good.

155
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:10,760
This is a Bentley.
1 Bentley for every 200 Rolls-Royce's.

156
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,040
- Alright fine... - Tell me,
would you like to get a drink?

157
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:17,966
Come on, I'll take you
too a special place.

158
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,436
I'm a member there.
My treat.

159
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,962
Maybe that's too
classy for me.

160
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,242
Alright then a bar.

161
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:29,761
Well, that sounds better.

162
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,756
I don't drink anymore,
but okay.

163
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:36,442
Just get in already!
My neck is getting sore.

164
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:43,042
So that's the type of shows
I had last year.

165
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,559
- Not bad.
- Right?

166
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:49,044
- And you?
- Nothing, little things.

167
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,154
Come on...

168
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,160
You're planning something,
that's why you're so secretive.

169
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:55,841
- I guessed it?
- No.

170
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:58,438
I don't really care
about the profession.

171
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:04,358
Want to hear something surprising?
I'm going underground.

172
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:05,766
- then...
- In the metro?

173
00:25:05,847 --> 00:25:08,645
Don't joke around
I'll raise from the dead.

174
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,235
In a sense.
No tricks.

175
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,452
- Totally natural.
- I see.

176
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:16,479
Tell me honestly,
it's a big thing no?

177
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,558
Yes, yes.
Classic.

178
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:24,360
The Church is upset of course,
but that's free publicity.

179
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:26,079
- So...
- Nice, nice.

180
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,283
Isn't it?
Now it's your turn.

181
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,161
- What would you like to hear?
- You know that!

182
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,685
- I have no idea.
- You can guess.

183
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:38,084
Or you think you're
that much better than me?

184
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,757
- Well it's... possible.
- Impossible.

185
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:45,766
- Hey, hey, hey. - The truth is
I'm the best.

186
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:48,765
- Wow! - Look, I know
all your tricks...

187
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:50,081
- Cigarette?
- ... all of them.

188
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,158
No, thank you.

189
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:55,359
How deep your
telepathy goes.

190
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:59,366
I know them all
and can do them.

191
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:02,081
- You don't believe it?
- Sure you can.

192
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:06,558
Fine... hold on!
See that street lamp.

193
00:26:06,687 --> 00:26:08,757
If you want,
I can turn it off.

194
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:11,162
- Oh, god no!
- Just say the word.

195
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,796
Didn't you say
you'd take me to a bar?

196
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:18,003
This is it.
My hotel, let me out.

197
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:20,078
I was happy to see you.

198
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:22,886
No, don't stop!

199
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:25,478
Step on it!

200
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:41,478
Very good.

201
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:45,199
- Good evening!
- Good evening, sir!

202
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:46,276
Sit down!

203
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:54,282
You must be surprised
that I called you in.

204
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:55,881
No.

205
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,081
Really?

206
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,081
Well... yes.

207
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,684
What's his method?

208
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:13,204
I know he only spoke to
you. I was informed.

209
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:16,275
See, I know everything.

210
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:18,406
Really.

211
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:23,083
By the way
he solved it.

212
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:27,485
We caught the killer,
he confessed too. Did you know?

213
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:30,996
No, I didn't hear.

214
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:34,198
Surprised?

215
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:39,118
No, sir.
It doesn't.

216
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:42,118
It doesn't...

217
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:45,202
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

218
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,199
Then find him!
Fast!

219
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:41,198
There was a picture here.
Some soil plan thing.

220
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:43,921
- Looks nice.
- Nice?

221
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,921
Maybe that's
not the right word.

222
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,322
Go back an image!

223
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:56,318
- Yes, yes.
- Here it is.

224
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:57,920
- This is it.
- Here. Here.

225
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:01,121
It's a nice drawing.

226
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:03,516
I printed it.

227
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:07,205
I have it here somewhere,
let's see.

228
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:10,526
Here.

229
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:14,916
This is the pit.

230
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:18,324
This is where
they'll bury me.

231
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,523
Well you've
gone all out!

232
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,200
You're being ironic.
But you're wrong.

233
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,682
Look, I'll show you!

234
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:30,004
Wait, you just stepped in
when I was looking at this.

235
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,721
- Careful with the program...
- No, wait!

236
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,724
- Listen, I'll show you something.
- ... something got into it.

237
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:35,916
- So!
- Here.

238
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:37,241
- So?
- Yes.

239
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:38,841
- Here.
- Yes.

240
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,038
Wait!
Just wait!

241
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:45,325
- Wait... see. - I don't
think you need all this.

242
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:49,241
You can do all
this without the mouse.

243
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,521
- Okay, but...
- Let's see a test!

244
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,716
- Look at the screen!
- I see, I see.

245
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:57,244
Hey!
Move the cursor!

246
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,918
That's not such a big deal.

247
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,518
Move it again.

248
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:16,516
Voil?

249
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:20,319
That's not my style.

250
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:23,837
I know your very good,
but this isn't what I do.

251
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:29,043
I know you have some sort
of natural power,

252
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:32,437
that I don't. I
needed lots of work,

253
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:36,520
so I could perfect
what I do.

254
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:39,844
That's something too.

255
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:43,122
What's this?
Let me see!

256
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:49,441
Hold on. If you indulge me, I'll get back
to this drawing, it's interesting.

257
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:53,765
140 centimetre deep pit.
It's exactly that much,

258
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:56,839
because my chest would be
crushed under the weight.

259
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:59,356
I don't know about your chest...

260
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:02,359
- Sorry but...
- I apologise!

261
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:05,166
So.
Back to the experiment,

262
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:07,442
the three days,
I'll spend underground,

263
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,559
do you know why
its unique?

264
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:11,638
Because I'll do it
without air.

265
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:15,043
I can't tell you how,
hope you understand.

266
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:19,239
It doesn't seem
too complicated.

267
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:21,760
Really?

268
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,641
- Then tell me how it's done.
- Fine, fine, fine.

269
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,438
It wasn't an insult.

270
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:34,165
- Continue!
- Wait, I'll help.

271
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:38,840
I'm going to use the system bears
use, so my brain won't get damaged.

272
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:42,164
The brain waves of
the bear are the key.

273
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:45,445
But you won't guess
from that either.

274
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:50,557
Tell me, why is
the press chasing you?

275
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,162
I had an affair with
police.

276
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,676
Murder,
dirty deeds.

277
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:57,959
How did it go?

278
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:03,557
Rich corpse, pictures, beider,
rococo, baroque, whatever you want.

279
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:08,566
It was cold. Do they
never heat in Paris?

280
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:38,278
Master, forgive me!

281
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:42,357
The commissioner is waiting.
A car is here.

282
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,678
Come on, let's
get a drink?

283
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,159
Don't look at me like that!
Let's drink!

284
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:08,877
Then we can go on.

285
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:17,876
No, no!

286
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,158
I'd like some red wine.

287
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:33,564
Vino.
Vino.

288
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,361
Rouge.

289
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:47,357
- What's he doing?
- Can't you see? He's drinking.

290
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,358
He waved to you...

291
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,332
Cheers!

292
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:17,278
A coffee please!

293
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:28,878
This is good wine.

294
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:12,878
You're a strange guy.

295
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:17,161
Sitting here. Don't come in,
then you come in,

296
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:20,198
then you drink
the wine.

297
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:22,684
Interesting.

298
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:26,678
What should I do with you?

299
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,679
I have no idea.

300
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:34,678
Look...

301
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,996
I can see in your eyes,
that you'll come tomorrow,

302
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:41,679
and ask me if you
can be my student.

303
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:44,277
And I won't know what
to do with you.

304
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:53,276
Don't look at me like that!

305
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:55,478
Just keep sitting here?

306
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:03,478
See it's not so devilish.

307
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,998
Your buddy can wait
outside right?

308
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:11,605
Keep drinking! Hey, sir!
Two more please!

309
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:16,397
Wait, you don't know how much
I can drink. Just wait and see!

310
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:20,795
Good morning viewers!
You're watching the TV5 weather report.

311
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,878
Let's take a look,

312
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:27,285
at the December 7th
projections!

313
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,882
Clouds cover most of Europe...

314
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:53,878
Thank you, good bye!

315
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:06,477
Good day, would you answer
a few questions? About religion...

316
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:08,524
No thank you.

317
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:28,318
Would you answer
a few questions?

318
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:31,316
I only speak English.

319
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:34,925
- Would you answer
a few questions? - I'm in a hurry.

320
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,995
- About religion in France.
- No.

321
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:51,003
Sir, please!
Would you answer a few questions?

322
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:53,525
It's only five minutes.

323
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:56,120
Are you catholic?

324
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,599
- No.
- No.

325
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,196
- Protestant?
- No.

326
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,795
- Jewish?
- No.

327
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:06,718
- Buddhist?
- No.

328
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:10,198
- Atheist?
- Yes.

329
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,798
I've seen you somewhere, right?

330
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:20,404
No.

331
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,001
I was positive.
Sorry.

332
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:30,315
- Do you go to confession?
- No... yes.

333
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:31,601
- Yes?
- Yes.

334
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,516
- Sometimes?
- No.

335
00:42:35,047 --> 00:42:37,322
- Never?
- No.

336
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,315
- Everyday?
- Yes.

337
00:42:40,527 --> 00:42:44,122
Really?
That's rare.

338
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,241
Do you go to
mass once a year?

339
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:49,521
No.

340
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:52,036
- Never.
- No... yes, yes!

341
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:54,845
Are you making fun of me?

342
00:42:54,927 --> 00:42:58,522
You say you confess daily,
but you're an atheist?

343
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:04,121
And I'm sure that
I've met you before.

344
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:08,240
- A coffee?
- I didn't say that because...

345
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:14,041
Do you believe in
the use of contraception?

346
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:15,442
A coffee?

347
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,919
What are you reading?

348
00:43:46,247 --> 00:43:47,919
A cook book...

349
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:51,919
Surprised again.
Can I see?

350
00:43:59,527 --> 00:44:03,042
Wow, seems complicated,
I can't cook at all.

351
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:09,720
- Sir, what would you like?
- Coffee.

352
00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:12,918
- Two?
- Yes.

353
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:16,038
Can you cook?

354
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:22,441
Look, it's funny,
it looks like America.

355
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:25,843
This is California,
this is Texas,

356
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:28,638
and Florida,

357
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,156
and the tail is
New York. Right?

358
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,163
I heard something
about pigs.

359
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:41,361
If you would lock up all the animals
with one week's worth of food,

360
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:45,042
they would all eat the food
at once, except the pig.

361
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:48,637
The pig would
spread it out.

362
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:53,966
It proves it's the
most intelligent.

363
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,358
It's musical too.

364
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:01,557
I love music,
you must too.

365
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:07,647
They say music is man mad,
but that's not true.

366
00:45:07,982 --> 00:45:13,438
If you slow down
bird calls,

367
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:17,437
the tunes are worthy
of great composers,

368
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:20,445
and... so...
that's all I wanted...

369
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,438
- Am I boring you?
- Aha.

370
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:49,436
Tell me honestly,
why am I here?

371
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,958
Do you like me?

372
00:45:58,247 --> 00:46:00,238
No, no.

373
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:05,042
- You were bored?
- Yes.

374
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:23,038
What do you expect of me?

375
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,362
You think I'm stupid?

376
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,683
This isn't the way to woo someone.

377
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,362
But you're not wooing me.

378
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,358
Fine.

379
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,361
Thanks for the coffee.
Bye.

380
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:59,081
You think you're so
mysterious being so quiet?

381
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:19,084
I thought about what you
said about the birds.

382
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,078
You're wrong.

383
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,084
I know you like me,
why don't you admit it?

384
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:39,078
Do you want to
sleep with me?

385
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:40,961
Yes, yes.

386
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:44,276
And the rest
doesn't matter?

387
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:46,561
No.

388
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:12,959
You didn't say anything
about my experiment.

389
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,956
Tell me what you think.

390
00:50:19,367 --> 00:50:21,961
There's a draft.
Should I close the window?

391
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,452
Why won't you answer me?

392
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:28,366
The thing is I need a favour.

393
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:34,278
So! Even the big
instinctive needs help.

394
00:50:34,887 --> 00:50:37,082
At your service!

395
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:43,681
But that doesn't change the fact,
that you didn't answer me.

396
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,401
I said we should close
the damn window.

397
00:50:48,887 --> 00:50:50,878
I don't mind the draft.

398
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:55,396
I don't even mind
the smoke.

399
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,001
Even though that
disgusts me.

400
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:05,602
I counted: You smoked
47 cigarettes in my house.

401
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:11,278
It hurts me that you
don't answer my questions.

402
00:51:11,687 --> 00:51:15,680
But I'm a calm person.
It's hard to make me mad.

403
00:51:19,687 --> 00:51:23,680
Fine.
Let's not talk about the experiment.

404
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:28,198
Though I don't need to say it's a little
condescending, in fact it's insulting.

405
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:36,201
What was the favour?

406
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:39,999
Well... umm... Nothing,
it's not important.

407
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:42,598
Out with it!

408
00:51:43,807 --> 00:51:45,798
It's nothing.

409
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:48,685
I just though you could
teach me a few things.

410
00:51:49,487 --> 00:51:52,206
Oh! Well that's
another story.

411
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:55,196
That's very humbling.

412
00:51:57,207 --> 00:52:00,199
Okay, but I won't
tell you just anything. No!

413
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:02,882
You mean the
levitation right?

414
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:05,602
Or the disappearing act?.

415
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:09,919
Well, I can show you
that if you want.

416
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,918
No, of course not, no!

417
00:52:13,207 --> 00:52:18,122
I was just thinking that
that you could teach me some French.

418
00:52:18,807 --> 00:52:21,401
It can come in handy.

419
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:24,599
- What?
- That's all.

420
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:29,723
You know, you choose a
very sneaky way to insult me.

421
00:52:33,327 --> 00:52:38,196
You solve crimes. As if there
aren't enough cops in the world.

422
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:42,800
But what I'm
doing works.

423
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:47,805
You're just a show off! You can't
do all that I can.

424
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:53,200
Houdini tried. 50 years
ago to go underground.

425
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:56,205
It didn't work for him.
It will for me.

426
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,995
Right, Houdini.
Very good.

427
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:04,802
- Okay, congratulations!
- Go ahead! Can you do it!

428
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:07,999
You wouldn't dare!
You can't!

429
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:13,121
- Just admit it!
- I don't like all the hype.

430
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:16,319
Like I said, it's
all talk! Show off!

431
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,718
Do it after me, if you can!

432
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:23,921
What? You want a duel?
Fine, let's have a duel!

433
00:53:25,607 --> 00:53:28,405
It's not a bad idea.
Okay, fine.

434
00:53:28,927 --> 00:53:31,725
I'll do it.
When?

435
00:53:31,847 --> 00:53:35,522
- Are you kidding...
- No, I'm not joking.

436
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:40,041
But this is insane.

437
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:44,036
- You're not ready.
- Well... I have time.

438
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:48,441
What did you say,
tomorrow afternoon?

439
00:53:49,047 --> 00:53:50,719
Okay fine.

440
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:09,241
I have to tell you something.

441
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,919
A cop is here.

442
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:13,839
He waited all night.

443
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:19,442
So go, and I didn't see you.

444
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,126
Understand?

445
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:31,126
I'm coming.

446
00:54:32,527 --> 00:54:35,121
I'm coming.

447
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:39,837
Just because...
I'd like to clear something up.

448
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:43,525
I... I...

449
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,939
I would gladly help.

450
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:48,628
But is this
a professional conversation?

451
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:50,324
It's okay I know what he wants.

452
00:54:50,647 --> 00:54:52,444
To take me to his boss.

453
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:56,324
Master,

454
00:54:57,447 --> 00:55:01,042
I thought about last night,

455
00:55:01,527 --> 00:55:04,724
and I would like to
be your student.

456
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:08,439
He wants something else.
To be your student.

457
00:55:08,567 --> 00:55:14,563
My student?
Surprising.

458
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,837
You're prettier
as a burnet.

459
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,842
What should I tell him?

460
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:23,958
Continue!

461
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:28,555
I read a lot after work,

462
00:55:28,647 --> 00:55:31,241
but I have no one
to guide me.

463
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:33,961
I'd like to know the
meaning of life.

464
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:38,638
Sorry!

465
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:47,045
Hello?
Hello?

466
00:55:48,047 --> 00:55:52,040
Yes, I do know where he is.

467
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,763
He's right in front of me.

468
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:03,959
Yes, sir.
We're going.

469
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:06,958
They have a celebration planed.

470
00:56:07,047 --> 00:56:09,959
You might get an award.

471
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:12,038
Anyway congratulations.

472
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:15,438
Let's get a taxi.

473
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:22,364
Taxi! Taxi!
Well be on time.

474
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:25,041
No, no!
Stay, I'm going alone.

475
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:29,046
But how? If I need to
translate, and...

476
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,886
I don't have the time now,
maybe later.

477
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:42,479
- Don't take it to heart!
- I'm not.

478
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:46,958
- Good bye!
- I'll walk you.

479
00:56:48,287 --> 00:56:52,678
- I'm not bothering you?
- He's not very nice.

480
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:56,084
- Don't make that face!
- What face?

481
00:56:57,287 --> 00:57:01,166
I'd like to know
your opinion.

482
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:03,881
- Some legal issues?
- No.

483
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:06,561
You're a sensitive boy.

484
00:57:06,687 --> 00:57:10,362
How do you see me?

485
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:12,486
That's a hard question...

486
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:16,560
Forget it, don't answer!
It was a silly question.

487
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:18,678
You're very sweet.

488
00:57:20,087 --> 00:57:23,682
- No really leave it!
- Yes, yes. Just a little wired.

489
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:25,485
What do you mean wired?

490
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,556
Well let's say...
not loose enough.

491
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:38,078
Thank you.

492
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:44,365
- Where was I?
- The sprits freedom.

493
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:49,277
Right, yes. I think
the state of the body...

494
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:52,882
- The fries are good.
- So the mind and body...

495
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:55,078
Stop it!

496
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:43,076
Look!

497
01:00:46,407 --> 01:00:49,080
- Did he die?
- No, he's breathing.

498
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,598
Put it under his head!

499
01:01:01,087 --> 01:01:02,998
Careful, don't wake him.

500
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:49,998
It's him!

501
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:55,998
Yes, it's him.

502
01:05:52,287 --> 01:05:54,005
Sir,

503
01:05:54,407 --> 01:05:57,001
do something for me!

504
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:01,998
Life is so hard!

505
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,198
Please, help!

506
01:06:07,007 --> 01:06:09,680
A little sign, please.

507
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,678
It's important
for my scholarship.

508
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:18,478
You have to fill out the
papers and send them.

509
01:08:24,487 --> 01:08:26,478
Otherwise?

510
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,677
Hold on, I'll call
you back.

511
01:08:39,007 --> 01:08:43,683
Just a second! Calm down,
I'll call someone, okay?

512
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:54,883
Hello.
Good afternoon!

513
01:08:55,887 --> 01:08:58,879
I was just thinking about you.

514
01:08:59,687 --> 01:09:02,884
Sure. Of course
I'll help, any time.

515
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:08,597
Of course.
Wait, I don't understand.

516
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:12,321
- Okay, well I guess...
- Tell her to stay!

517
01:09:12,407 --> 01:09:14,716
I don't want her to leave.
Will you help?

518
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:17,126
Here she is.

519
01:09:18,127 --> 01:09:21,119
Hello?
Who am I talking to?

520
01:09:26,127 --> 01:09:28,402
I don't understand,
what's going on.

521
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,118
No, of course I'm not afraid.

522
01:09:42,207 --> 01:09:47,201
No it's not that,
it's just strange.

523
01:09:51,207 --> 01:09:53,198
My dear,

524
01:09:54,527 --> 01:09:59,726
believe me he
could really love you.

525
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:10,119
The thought never crossed
my mind that he doesn't speak French.

526
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,198
I had a conversation
with him.

527
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:16,196
Now I feel a little silly.

528
01:10:21,607 --> 01:10:23,199
Yes?

529
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:26,205
Don't let her go! Get
her to stay!

530
01:10:26,327 --> 01:10:27,919
Thank you.

531
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:39,518
No I'm not laughing at him.

532
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:44,520
Fine.

533
01:10:58,927 --> 01:11:00,918
Thank you.
Good bye.

534
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,517
Hello?
Hello?

535
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:35,918
- An autograph.
- Me too.

536
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,918
How do you feel?

537
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:46,238
Very well, thank you.

538
01:11:46,847 --> 01:11:50,012
Say a few words
to the viewers.

539
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:53,323
No, not right now.
See you in three days!

540
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:56,319
Why isn't Simon here?

541
01:11:56,447 --> 01:12:00,122
Don't detest him for it.

542
01:12:02,727 --> 01:12:05,036
It might not be that he's a coward.

543
01:12:05,127 --> 01:12:07,721
This is an extremely
dangerous experiment.

544
01:12:07,847 --> 01:12:09,838
We have no right
to judge him.

545
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,238
Why are you alone?

546
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:18,522
I'm always alone.

547
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:26,918
I think he's not coming.

548
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,319
Looks that way.

549
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:35,645
- What do we do now?
- Do you want to go? I'll walk you.

550
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:38,639
No, it's okay I want to stay.

551
01:12:39,247 --> 01:12:43,240
- I want to see what happens.
- He's right not to have come.

552
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:46,046
Maybe he just forgot.

553
01:12:46,127 --> 01:12:48,322
I'd like to know
what he's doing now.

554
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:20,524
No, sir, it's a
restricted area.

555
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:22,842
Hey, old man,
stay outside.

556
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:29,436
I illiterate again that
this is not a trick.

557
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:32,445
He's here!
He came!

558
01:13:33,047 --> 01:13:34,366
I'm coming!

559
01:13:34,447 --> 01:13:35,960
Look, it's Simon!

560
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,635
Excuse me, master,
I didn't recognise you.

561
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,158
There's no
problem right?

562
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:59,161
We we're worried,
and we're waiting for you.

563
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:06,242
Go on, go to him.

564
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,238
Can I see you?

565
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,238
Here.

566
01:14:35,367 --> 01:14:40,764
I have an exam,
but in three days.

567
01:14:42,247 --> 01:14:46,638
Ten at night? Okay?
Ten at night here?

568
01:14:53,047 --> 01:14:54,639
- Good bye!
- Good bye!

569
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:13,762
My friend, Simon!
Late again.

570
01:15:14,767 --> 01:15:17,042
Nice markers.

571
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:19,837
You'll get some too.

572
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:25,845
You know...
I thought I wouldn't see you.

573
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:28,958
I promised, no?

574
01:15:36,047 --> 01:15:38,038
But I'm here now.

575
01:15:40,087 --> 01:15:42,078
Can we start?

576
01:15:43,087 --> 01:15:45,078
Smile!

577
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:49,365
- Camera.
- We have different styles.

578
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:51,964
Don't deny it.

579
01:15:55,487 --> 01:15:57,955
This is a race.

580
01:16:33,367 --> 01:16:35,358
You smoke a lot?

581
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:43,358
Your blood pressure
is too high.

582
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:47,884
You know what? Tell him
I have stage fright.

583
01:16:58,087 --> 01:17:00,885
You don't seem like
the type.

584
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:09,880
Now he'll tell you
about suffocation.

585
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:15,878
First you feel a pressure...

586
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:19,887
then the breathing quickens...

587
01:17:19,922 --> 01:17:22,082
and the heart.

588
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:26,559
The head throbs,
the ears ring.

589
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:31,555
You begin to panic
and become afraid.

590
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:50,081
That's it!
Swats, nausea, vomiting.

591
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,961
The body shakes...

592
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:57,965
trembles,
then the pain...

593
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:23,285
Don't do it!
Don't try it!

594
01:18:24,287 --> 01:18:27,279
If you want I'll come
up with some good excuse.

595
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:30,852
This is totally, crazy...

596
01:18:30,887 --> 01:18:33,196
and the truth is,
you know it too.

597
01:18:39,207 --> 01:18:42,199
How could I go on
if something happens to you?

598
01:18:43,207 --> 01:18:45,482
What could happen?

599
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:53,005
I don't think this is what you want,
you were just dragged into it.

600
01:18:57,007 --> 01:18:59,999
I'm glad I met you doctor,
you're a good man.

601
01:19:00,687 --> 01:19:03,201
Where's the
paper I need to sign?

602
01:19:15,087 --> 01:19:17,806
Viewers! A few minuets
and the experiment will start.

603
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:22,199
In three days the graves
will open, and hopefully,

604
01:19:22,287 --> 01:19:25,802
the two magicians will
be alive.

605
01:19:29,887 --> 01:19:31,479
My friends!

606
01:19:32,407 --> 01:19:36,195
Then... in three days!

607
01:19:36,607 --> 01:19:38,802
Move the microphones.

608
01:19:43,807 --> 01:19:45,798
- On last photo!
- Me too!

609
01:20:04,487 --> 01:20:06,796
Sure you don't want it?

610
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:10,803
Thank you now.

611
01:24:10,807 --> 01:24:13,082
I feel fine.

612
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:20,078
I rested a little.

613
01:25:07,487 --> 01:25:10,081
- Something's wrong.
- Yes.

614
01:25:11,087 --> 01:25:13,203
Let me through.

615
01:25:15,327 --> 01:25:16,726
The doctor, quickly!
