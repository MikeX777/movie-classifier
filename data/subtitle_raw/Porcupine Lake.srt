1
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:43,475
Parry Sound,
Georgian Bay's biggest variety.

2
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,129
Hey Bea, wake up honey,
we're almost there.

3
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:08,634
Bea?

4
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:34,620
Hey.

5
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,922
Hey! We made it.

6
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:37,923
You did.

7
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,893
How was the drive?

8
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,861
Not too bad, actually.

9
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,696
- Hello, buttercup.
- Hi, Dad.

10
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,536
Hey, you! Come on!

11
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,803
Can I go look inside?

12
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,406
Yeah, go.

13
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,307
Good dog.

14
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,713
Here, I'll take that.

15
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,862
Everybody, this is my daughter, Bea.

16
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,896
- Hi.
- Hi, Bea.

17
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,598
- My wife, Ally.
- Hi.

18
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,799
- Hi.
- Hi.

19
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,067
Pipe, can you watch the place a minute?

20
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:22,968
Sure.

21
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,674
Can I have an ice cream?

22
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,741
Yup!

23
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,747
Oh, you want to stack them.

24
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,085
No, not in there. Eric, no.

25
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,254
Stop!

26
00:03:58,906 --> 00:03:59,738
             - Hi.

27
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,639
             - Hi.

28
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,988
- This summer's a trial,
   Scotty.

29
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,356
    Not promising anything.

30
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,192
- I know.

31
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,262
            I know.

32
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,142
- Scotty,

33
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,826
  I need my special milkshake
      with extra vanilla.

34
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,296
          - Coming up.

35
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:11,737
   Hey, what would you say to
   a hot tub in the backyard?

36
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,122
       - That'd be cool.

37
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,506
    - Mm-hm? You think your
      mom would like that?

38
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,709
        - I don't know,
     because there's germs.

39
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,512
- Yes, germs.

40
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,319
   Do you remember this place
 when your grandfather had it?

41
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,220
           - Sort of.

42
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,357
- Well, he's left it to me now.

43
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,393
Been working hard to fix it up.

44
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,394
          - I like it.

45
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,395
            - What?

46
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,229
          - I like it.

47
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,096
      - I can't hear you.

48
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:42,667
- I like it!

49
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,069
      - I love this place.

50
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,637
      I love that Scotty's
   keeping it in the family.

51
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,905
          That's good.

52
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,507
      - No, it's for sale.

53
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,443
  Joe up the road was yakking
about buying it, remember that?

54
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,595
- Yup.

55
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:55,746
- That would be a
  disaster, though.

56
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,850
   - I think a swimming pool
would be better than a hot tub.

57
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,918
          - All right.

58
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,423
  Let's build a swimming pool,
             then.

59
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,832
             - Hi.
             - Hey.

60
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,303
       What'cha reading?

61
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,939
- Catching the Big Fish.

62
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,340
- Do you like it?

63
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,143
   - Yeah. Dad gave it to me.

64
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,217
- There's lots of great kids up
           here, Bea.

65
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,118
- I know.

66
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,321
    - You just need to take
        some initiative.

67
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,794
   - I wish I was older so I
could drink special milkshakes.

68
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,563
- You don't want
   to be old.

69
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,668
  - There's a spider up there.

70
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,469
- Where?

71
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,938
   - In the corner, up there.

72
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,808
    What if it crawls in my
    mouth when I'm sleeping?

73
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,410
- It won't crawl in your mouth.

74
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,346
- Kitchen's closed for
   the night!

75
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,681
- No, no, no, no.

76
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:47,052
 - Good night bunny, love you.

77
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,453
        - Love you, too.

78
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,177
    - I'm a mechanic, right?

79
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:16,147
     I'm a good one, but I
   could be a great stripper

80
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,583
    and there's money to it.

81
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,054
         Could travel,
     make love every night.

82
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,828
  But you, you have a family.

83
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,565
That's the best, I'm jealous of
           you, man.

84
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,707
   He's not playing anymore.

85
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,242
       - Callum, come on.

86
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,845
           Good dog.

87
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,532
            - Whoa!

88
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,200
  - Was it dark enough for you
          last night?

89
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,101
             - Yes.

90
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,838
   - Morning, Pipe. Western?

91
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,407
- Uh, sure.

92
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,476
    - I hear you're thinking
    about buying this place.

93
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,980
     - I was, but the wife
    says no, so that's that.

94
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,882
- That's right.

95
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,620
- Three cones, please.

96
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,423
- Sure. What kind can I get you?

97
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,457
         - The orange.

98
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,061
        - I'll have the
       butterscotch one.

99
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:42,567
- And I'll take chocolate mint?

100
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:43,468
            - Okay.

101
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,106
    - I love those candies.
           - Me too!

102
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,140
      - They're the best.

103
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,349
         - Here you go.

104
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,685
           - Thanks.
       - You're welcome.

105
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,364
      - You didn't eat it.

106
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,265
         - Not hungry.

107
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,104
   - Hey Bea, I know you're a
little old for a lemonade stand.

108
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,272
            - Yeah.

109
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,439
   - But I did uncover a box
  of gack up in the attic that

110
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,541
       if you wanted to
        put a table out?

111
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,442
         - Okay, sure.

112
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,146
  - Make some spending money,
             good.

113
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,520
- Did you hear
 about Gillian and Rachel?

114
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,189
- Oh my gosh,
  I don't even know why.

115
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,891
       He's such a fruit.

116
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,760
- I kind of like
  him, he's pretty cool.

117
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,862
       - Are you serious?
            - Yeah.

118
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,364
       - No, just don't.
     - Sue, don't say that.

119
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,400
     Guys, my ice cream's
        really melting.

120
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,470
- Yeah.

121
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,038
- Oh, stop!

122
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,315
           - Callum!

123
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,093
        Come on, Callum!

124
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,995
         Ready? Ready?

125
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,229
    Ready to get the stick?

126
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,464
         Get the stick?

127
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,566
         Get the stick!

128
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,870
       Go get it. Go on.

129
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,939
  Come on, Callum, go get it.

130
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,928
   - Dollar is spelled wrong.

131
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,696
    It should be with an A.

132
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,198
          D-O-L-L-A-R?

133
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,702
       Want me to fix it?
            - Okay.

134
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,248
- There, have you sold any yet?

135
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,116
             - No.

136
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,853
- People around here are cheap.

137
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,026
       Is that your dog?

138
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:22,927
            - Yeah.

139
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,130
       His name's Callum.

140
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,703
    - His eyes are so cool.

141
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,707
 My mom's allergic, so I can't
           have one.

142
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,911
    Let's put them in rows.

143
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,047
     Hey, Pipe, want to buy
           something?

144
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,249
- What are you selling?

145
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,150
 - Tipis and canoes, and these
          red jewels.

146
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,019
 - The jewels aren't for sale.
             - Oh.

147
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,456
- Um, all right, I'll
   take a canoe.

148
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,624
     - You sure you don't
          want a tipi?

149
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,458
They look really good together.

150
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,993
- No.

151
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:55,894
            - Sold!

152
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,532
        Have a good day.
     - All right, you too.

153
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:03,868
          - See? Easy.

154
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,906
    You here for the summer?

155
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,508
    - Maybe, my mom doesn't
   want to make any promises.

156
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,844
       - What's her job?

157
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,445
       - She's a teacher.

158
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,546
            - Cool.

159
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,982
  - But she's not my teacher.

160
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,284
    - Yeah, that'd be weird.

161
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,184
            - Yeah.

162
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,490
  - Want to come to my house?

163
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,726
       - I'd have to ask.

164
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:29,627
             - Why?

165
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,198
      Well, go ask, then.

166
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,946
        - Just the bill.
       - Okay, hey bunny.

167
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,948
   - My friend wants to know
   if I can go to her house.

168
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,882
          - Who does?

169
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,617
          - That girl.

170
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,351
  She's helping with the gift
shop, and we just made a dollar.

171
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,455
       - You good, Betty?
           - Mm-hmm.

172
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,124
   - She's the one who bought
   that ice cream, remember?

173
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,594
You told me to take initiative.

174
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,364
   - I know, I just thought
          that maybe--

175
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,667
- Please, Mom? Can I go, please?

176
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,502
 - Let her go. It's summertime.

177
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,107
 - Okay, well, call me when you
           get there.

178
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,008
        - Okay, thanks.

179
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,681
- Scotty, please do not butt in,
             okay?

180
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,582
            - Okay.

181
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,854
- I just wanted to do something
           fun today.

182
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,823
      - I'll do something
         fun with you.

183
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,527
    - Where's your brother?

184
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,197
      - How should I know?
      - This smells moldy.

185
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,498
- Well, it's not.

186
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,637
    - Hey, tell Romeo Nick's
    having a party tonight.

187
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,206
 - Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

188
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,811
  They think they're so cool.

189
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,250
           I'm Kate.

190
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,752
           - I'm Bea.

191
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,387
      - Good to meet you.

192
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,977
     I think walkovers are
          pretty easy.

193
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,378
  I'm working on a back flip.

194
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,783
       - I know some tap.

195
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,452
      - Oh, you've got to
   teach me to tap, promise?

196
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,787
            - Okay.

197
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,623
     Yeah, I've been taking
  lessons for a long time now,

198
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,627
    and it actually takes a
     lot of ankle strength.

199
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,629
    - What's your favorite
        Popsicle flavor?

200
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:46,964
           - Banana.

201
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,332
- Banana?

202
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,434
         - Is that bad?

203
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,402
 - Well, it's, like, the worst
          flavor ever,

204
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,604
     but it won't kill you
          or anything.

205
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,107
- Well I also
  like chocolate.

206
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,775
- Yeah, chocolate's much better.

207
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,746
      Mountains or ocean?

208
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,247
       - Ocean, I think.

209
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,283
       - Paris or Hawaii?

210
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,319
    - Hawaii, Hawaii, yeah.

211
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,621
 - Um, hot chocolate or coffee?

212
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,257
        - Hot chocolate.

213
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,425
     - Walking or swimming?

214
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,427
           - Walking.

215
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,097
          - Hey, guys!

216
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,133
   - Don't look at them don't
  talk to them, keep walking.

217
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,335
- What's her problem?

218
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,304
    - Why aren't they your
        friends anymore?

219
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,705
    - Because they squealed.

220
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,674
   They made up stupid stuff
          about Romeo.

221
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:35,246
  Never, ever squeal that's a
         rule, promise?

222
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,147
          - I promise.

223
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,030
   - That's just my brother.

224
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,032
    He shoots stuff for fun.

225
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,934
   Don't be scared. Come on.

226
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:05,877
         Anybody home?

227
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,778
             Hi-ya!

228
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,482
   Romeo taught me karate for
         self-defense.

229
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:13,751
          Want a sip?

230
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,652
         - No, thanks.

231
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:26,998
    - I know what we can do.

232
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,073
    I'm thinking of being a
    hairdresser or a pilot.

233
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,178
       Don't worry, I cut
   Romeo's hair all the time.

234
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,979
   - You're not cutting it,
            are you?

235
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,048
   - No, I'm just giving it a
         little style.

236
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,487
 Do you want to go to the party
            or not?

237
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,388
             - No.

238
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,000
       Do we have to go?

239
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,203
     - Yeah, of course what
     else are we gonna do?

240
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,517
         - Whoo, warm!
     - Feisty man, feisty.

241
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,852
    - All right! It's time.

242
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,488
     Who's coming swimming?
         - Sorry, Nick.

243
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,224
          - Ah Billy?
     - It's too early, man.

244
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,225
 - You said you were coming in
           for sure!

245
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,593
            - Pass.
          - I'll come.

246
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:30,795
           - Really?

247
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,765
  Billy, you're, uh one lucky
   bastard to have this girl.

248
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:38,603
          - Oh no! No!
     - Let's go! Let's go!

249
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,771
- This way.

250
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,440
- Oh my God!

251
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,277
- You're so beautiful, Cheryl.
-  - No, I'm not.

252
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,346
- Yeah, you are.

253
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,417
         Oh, god, yes.

254
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,319
        - That's Romeo.

255
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,224
       - We should do it.
        - I don't know.

256
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,627
- Come on, trust me.

257
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,565
        It'll be great.
  - Romeo, I don't think, no.

258
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,200
              No!

259
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,501
   - What is wrong with you?
            - What?

260
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,770
- You're a cock-tease!

261
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,639
  This is bullshit. Forget it.

262
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,940
       - I wanna go home.

263
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,684
 - Cheryl is such a cock-tease!

264
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,286
             - Why?

265
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,887
  - Because she makes it seem
like she wants it all the time,

266
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,789
  but then when he wants it,
          she doesn't!

267
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,957
      - What does he want?

268
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,393
    - Jesus, Bea, don't you
         know anything?

269
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:37,461
            - Sorry.

270
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,397
          - It's okay.

271
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,099
     You can't help it that
      you're from Toronto.

272
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,404
     - What are you doing?

273
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,706
   - Kissing. Was that okay?

274
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,676
            - Yeah.

275
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:52,576
            - Cool.

276
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,601
           Wait here.

277
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,317
   You sleep with your head
          at this end,

278
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,585
    and I'll sleep this way.

279
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,155
    - I should call my mom.

280
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,624
   - No, you already called
           her twice.

281
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,525
           Lie down.

282
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,428
- I have to go to the bathroom.

283
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,329
       - Okay, hurry up.

284
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,572
     Do you ever think that
     maybe you're adopted?

285
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,208
             - No.

286
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,245
   - Sometimes I think I am.

287
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,280
    Like I don't really fit
        with my family.

288
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:40,084
   - Well, I've seen pictures
   of when I was a baby with

289
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,453
        my mom and dad,
      so I'm pretty sure.

290
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,656
      - Did you cry a lot?
        - I don't know.

291
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:51,595
   - I feel like we could be
   sisters, do you feel that?

292
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:53,931
            - Yeah.

293
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,436
           - Kiss me.

294
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,776
        You taste minty.

295
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,513
             Night.
         - Good night.

296
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,318
    - Oh, and try not to put
 your foot in my face, whoops!

297
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,455
      Turn the light off.

298
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,656
        - Jesus Christ!

299
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,729
          Who are you?

300
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,298
 - I'm Bea. I'm Kate's friend.

301
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,868
- Go back to sleep.

302
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,769
          Katie? Kate!

303
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:08,055
             - Mom?

304
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:09,539
- You left the door
unlocked again don't be stupid.

305
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,342
  - I left it open for Romeo.

306
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:15,746
   - I want you to clean that
  pool today, no more excuses.

307
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:29,360
- Hmm-mm, yeah.

308
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,327
- Live from
 the Parry Sound newsroom!

309
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,695
 - You sure you're not hungry?

310
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,264
             - No.
     - This is Moose News.

311
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,498
    - Yeah, I miss you too.

312
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,368
   So what time do you think
    you're going to be here?

313
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,704
  Luke, can you come have some
    breakfast, please, Luke!

314
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:42,723
   - Hey, you still owe me 50
             cents.

315
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:43,840
 - So are you okay for dinner?
         - No, I don't!

316
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,309
         - Yes, you do!
             - No!

317
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,444
   - Yeah, I loaned it to you
    for your stupid pinball!

318
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,246
- No, 11 is too late.
    Hey!

319
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,152
- Oh, yeah!

320
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:55,986
          - Come here.

321
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,455
 - Of course I'm disappointed.

322
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,891
    Yeah, I'm disappointed.
       This is bullshit.

323
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,693
    You're just not going to
  see your daughter this week?

324
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,597
- Make me a mix.

325
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,835
     - Bea's dad runs the
          Snack Shack.

326
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:12,803
- Cool.

327
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,738
   - We started a gift shop
           for money.

328
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,924
    - What are you selling?

329
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:19,109
- Tipis and canoes
 and stuff, they're handmade.

330
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,611
        - Who made them?

331
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,213
     - Friend of my dad's.

332
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,814
- Can you give me
 a ride to Jesse's house?

333
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,484
            - When?
             - Now.

334
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,019
- Don't do it, he owes me
   50 cents.

335
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,621
    - I can't. I'm working
          with Billy.

336
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,289
         - Can I come?
             - No.

337
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,159
        - I need coffee!
  - I'll get it for you, Mom!

338
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,461
- Thank you, love.

339
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,497
   - What's your name again?

340
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:41,365
             - Bea.

341
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:43,901
      - Let's go outside.

342
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,053
Mom's making us clean the pool.

343
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:07,524
     Come on, let's get in.

344
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,727
     - It might have germs.

345
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,628
         - Oh, my God.

346
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:12,896
   Grab that net over there.

347
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,402
    You think Romeo's cute?

348
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,303
        - I don't know.

349
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,473
   - Everybody falls in love
           with him.

350
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,274
- What happened to his
    head?

351
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,977
    - Oh, last year, he got
  into a motorcycle accident.

352
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,712
       He had to have a
        brain operation.

353
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,214
        He almost died.

354
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,983
    My mom was freaking out
 'cause she loves him the most.

355
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,153
    Why are you so serious
         all the time?

356
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,087
   You should see your face!

357
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,590
   - What did you say to Mom?
           - Nothing!

358
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,358
  - Well, she knows something.

359
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,326
    She was just screaming
         her head off.

360
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,495
     What did you tell her?
          - I didn't!

361
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,796
   - You don't know anything.

362
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,398
         Okay? Nothing.

363
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,266
          You hear me?
           - I know.

364
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,501
      - Don't stare at me.

365
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,073
       - I didn't squeal.

366
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,276
     He can't help it when
          he gets mad.

367
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,378
 It's just because of his head.

368
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,048
 It's like there's a switch in
 his brain, and it just flips.

369
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,117
   It's like, he's okay, he's
 okay, he's okay, and then bam!

370
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,352
         Bam, bam, bam!

371
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,655
      - I, I need to, I...

372
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,293
 - Are you okay? What's wrong?

373
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:49,827
    ¶ Planning your escape
          days away ¶

374
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,464
 - Here, drink some juice, you
          sleep okay?

375
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,965
            - Yeah.

376
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,767
 - What happened, did something
           scare you?

377
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,668
           - Nothing.

378
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,938
      - Bea faints easily.

379
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,606
      It's really common,
        but if you feel

380
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,375
  stressed or nervous, then--
          - Mom. Mom!

381
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,078
   - What? It's nothing to be
          ashamed of.

382
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,947
    Okay, if you feel dizzy,
       you just lay down.

383
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,281
   Stay close to the ground.
           - I know.

384
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,050
     - I think my mom might
      have the same thing.

385
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:15,018
  She's stressed all the time.

386
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,621
   - Specials, on the house.

387
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,328
 - I want you to take it easy,
             okay?

388
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,596
            - Okay.

389
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,265
   - I can keep her company,
    I've nothing else to do.

390
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:33,103
        - That's great.
        - I don't know.

391
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,390
            - What?

392
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:54,291
          - Your nose.

393
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,194
    - How'd that get there?

394
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,333
              Eat.

395
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,809
     - I'd like a special.
      - Give me a second.

396
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:12,876
          - Thank you.

397
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,113
- She's a kid.

398
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,781
She's making friends. It's good.

399
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:21,685
 - Am I doing something wrong?

400
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:22,586
             - No.

401
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,292
           - Thanks.

402
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,227
      - It was delicious.

403
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,497
- Next time, you do the dishes.

404
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,633
    Hey why don't we have a
  family night tonight, okay?

405
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,136
            - Okay.

406
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,774
        - Get some rest!
           - We will!

407
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,085
     - Family night, pfft!

408
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,508
          - Hi, Emile.

409
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,643
          - Hey, Kate.

410
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,412
      - What're you doing?

411
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,882
- I'm trying to get the battery
            to work.

412
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,069
         - That's cool.

413
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,620
    Um, my mom was wondering
   if you could fix her car.

414
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:31,455
  - Well, depends what's wrong
            with it.

415
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,056
   - That's okay, thanks bye!

416
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,726
      You did it! Come on!

417
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:56,713
      You think she's hot?

418
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,181
  - Yeah, she's really pretty.

419
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,184
    Oh, I really like her--

420
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,019
          - Her butt?

421
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:03,787
        - No, her hair.

422
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,322
- God, Luke,
 what are you doing here?

423
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,690
   - What are you doing here?

424
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:07,591
          - Something.

425
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,093
 Ah, you want to see it, you've
 got to show Bea your pee-pee.

426
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,194
    - No way. You're crazy!

427
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,162
       - Fine. Forget it.

428
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,067
 - I don't want him to show me.

429
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,335
     - You coming, or what?

430
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:30,714
        Bea, stand here.

431
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:31,480
      Luke, pull down your
    pants for three seconds.

432
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,616
- No.

433
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,152
     - Come on, what's the
    big deal, it's nothing.

434
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,587
 Pull down your pants, and you
 get this whole sexy calendar.

435
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,222
           - No way!

436
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,758
    - This is Miss May, and
      that's only a taste.

437
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,993
      Pull them down now!

438
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,034
         What no way,
     you're such a chicken!

439
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,105
      - Why'd you do that?

440
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:56,740
  - I have to teach you stuff,
              Bea.

441
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,343
You can't go through your whole
  life without seeing a penis.

442
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,578
         I'll show you.

443
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,384
This is how big it gets, and it
           gets hard.

444
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,588
    Romeo walks around with
     a boner all the time.

445
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,256
       - What's a boner?

446
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,257
       - Oh, my god, Bea!

447
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,630
   Do you wish I had a penis?

448
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:23,834
      - No, I'm glad you
      don't have a penis.

449
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:27,571
    - You're my best friend.

450
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,056
      Let's hide a secret
         in this tree,

451
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,825
  something you've never told
  anybody in your whole life.

452
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:51,495
             Ready?

453
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,599
- Ready.

454
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,071
- Parry Sound.

455
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:36,973
- Go.

456
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,621
          - Thank you!
          - Oh, sorry.

457
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:58,161
          - I'm ready.

458
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,632
    His opening shot, whoa!

459
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:07,337
   And it goes in, oh, yeah!

460
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,240
   Want to play some tennis?
            - Sure.

461
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,945
- If you had to live
 in a world of only movies

462
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,913
        or only books,
    which would you choose?

463
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:19,683
- I don't know.

464
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,184
    That's a hard question.
             - Yes.

465
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:25,956
       I'd go with books.

466
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,591
           - Really?
         - Definitely.

467
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,962
- Think I'd have to go
   with movies.

468
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,431
 Couldn't live without movies.

469
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:03,426
- Holy
   mackerel.

470
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:06,129
- Think I missed a
 big chunk of the movie there.

471
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,464
- Watching them?

472
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,966
         - Good night.

473
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,635
        - Night, bunny!
         - Night, love.

474
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:17,240
 - It still changes everything.
            - What?

475
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:19,709
- Well, you said you
   were selling,

476
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,044
    and now you're talking
       about renovating,

477
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,345
       and those are two
       different things.

478
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,314
- I don't wanna
   fight tonight.

479
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:25,415
- Okay, you know what?

480
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,515
   I think you should sleep
         on the couch.

481
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,985
- No.

482
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:29,986
- I'm serious.

483
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,688
- I'm serious too, no.

484
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,290
- Go on.

485
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,624
- No. Close the door.

486
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:10,860
           - Wake up!

487
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,896
       What do you think?

488
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,097
They're called French Midnight.

489
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:14,931
       Lola put them on.

490
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:15,832
            - Nice!

491
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:19,936
  - I have to brush my teeth.

492
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,739
   - Did you dream about me
          last night?

493
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,076
   I dreamt about you, here.

494
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,478
           A present.

495
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:31,147
          Put 'em on.

496
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,385
       - Breakfast time.

497
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,556
        You coming down?

498
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,457
         - In a minute!

499
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:47,697
    - Is Kate in there with
    you, I'm making omelets.

500
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,068
- Ooh, omelets,
 omelets sexy, sexy omelets.

501
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,373
- Bea?

502
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,407
         - I'm coming!

503
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,447
 - I wanna teach you something.

504
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,315
         Pay attention.

505
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:07,417
        Open your mouth.

506
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,586
        Open your mouth!

507
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,087
          Wider. Okay.

508
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,255
     Stick your tongue out.

509
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,292
            - Whoa.

510
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,893
       - No, it's called
        French kissing.

511
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:18,328
     Okay, I put my tongue
         in your mouth,

512
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,330
    and you put your tongue
    in my mouth, all right?

513
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:23,366
   And we kiss, okay ready,
          do it again.

514
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,267
            - Okay.

515
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,870
       - Open your mouth.

516
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:31,975
           All right.

517
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,849
  Maybe Cheryl had her period,

518
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,585
   and that's why she didn't
  want to have sex with Romeo.

519
00:38:45,257 --> 00:38:47,057
  Do you have your period yet?

520
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:47,924
             - No.

521
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,326
         - Oh, my God.

522
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,894
        It's the curse.

523
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:53,129
 Every month, a bucket of blood
           comes out.

524
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,800
 I can teach you how to wear a
 tampon, or you can wear a pad,

525
00:38:56,802 --> 00:39:01,204
 but they're gross and mostly,
  you can't get pregnant while

526
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,473
   you're on your period, but
    sometimes you still can,

527
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:07,043
     like my sister, Lola,
sometimes freaky things happen.

528
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,385
 Did you like it when I French
          kissed you?

529
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:18,588
     - Yes did you like it
     when I did it to you?

530
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,223
  - It's pretty good for your
          first time,

531
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,691
  but you'll get better at it.

532
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,795
 - How come you spit like that?

533
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,696
        - For moisture.

534
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,833
           Breakfast?

535
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:30,734
          - All right.

536
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,607
        - You guys good?
             - Yep.

537
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,044
        - There you are.
          - Thank you.

538
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,245
- More coffee
  when you get a chance?

539
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:43,146
            - Sure.

540
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,882
    Did you have breakfast?

541
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:47,951
- I can pay
  for the ice creams.

542
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,185
      - I want you to eat.

543
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,787
  - It's summer holidays, Mom.

544
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,155
   - Well, tell your dad you
     don't want his omelet,

545
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,324
  and if you faint, don't come
         crying to me.

546
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,104
- Your mom was way more mad than
           your dad.

547
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,205
     - He was sad, though.

548
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,410
 - Does he ever make spaghetti?

549
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:48,378
       - Yeah, sometimes.

550
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:51,147
  - I would be so fat if I had
           your dad.

551
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:57,854
       My dad's a loser.

552
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:05,929
  Do you think he's possessed?

553
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:07,931
             - No.

554
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:12,168
     - His eyes are freaky,
    I think he's possessed.

555
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,170
      - I don't think so.

556
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,507
 - Then why is he so happy all
           the time?

557
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,209
  - Well, my mom rescued him.

558
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:20,477
    - Well, he's not normal.

559
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:29,552
    I want to go to my house
     and make halter tops.

560
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,255
        He can't come,
       my mom hates dogs.

561
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,890
They just get everything dirty.

562
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:43,299
- Stay, Callum, you can't come.

563
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,141
          - You start.

564
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,810
           - I start?
       - Yeah, you start.

565
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:54,878
          - I'm going.

566
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,947
   - Why does it have to be
          Nick's dog?

567
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,049
   - Because he didn't pay,
            shut up.

568
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,319
    Hey, not for you, runt,
         put them back.

569
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,488
      - Can I have a beer?

570
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,526
   - You only get one if you
    play, how 'bout it, Bea?

571
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,694
    - Hey don't be a jerk,
        leave her alone.

572
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:17,200
- Okay, , it's your
   turn, go.

573
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,101
            - 'Kay.

574
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,306
- Okay, oh oh,
   my god, 'kay.

575
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:24,641
         So yesterday,
      when I was at work,

576
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,876
      this guy came in and
    completely spazzed out--

577
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:27,710
         - I like dogs.

578
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:28,912
       - Shut up, Billy.

579
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,814
- Anyway, and then he
   got back up,

580
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,183
     and oh, look at that.

581
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,954
    - Really? I lose, great.
            - Nice.

582
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,956
 - Sure you don't want to play?

583
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,424
  - No, we don't want to play.

584
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,262
        This is my room.

585
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,567
     Lola's learning how to
   make clothes for fashion.

586
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:51,935
   It's like a can-can skirt.

587
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:58,274
    - This is the same kind
     we have at the Shack.

588
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:03,179
  - Oh, yeah I took that from
  you before we were friends.

589
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,349
    Look, she made this too.

590
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,485
    It's like a halter top.

591
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:10,620
     You should try it on.

592
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:13,756
      Take off your shirt.

593
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,759
             - Hey!

594
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:17,927
           Out, now!

595
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:18,828
      - It's my room too.

596
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,763
    - Don't touch my stuff.

597
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,198
      Seriously, you guys,
     if Lisa starts to cry,

598
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,232
      I'm gonna kill you.

599
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:24,367
            - Bitch!

600
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,002
- Kate, you are
   such an idiot.

601
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:26,903
            - Hello?

602
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:29,906
             Yeah.

603
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:34,143
             Okay.

604
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,044
             Shit.

605
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:50,360
        - I feel dizzy.

606
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:53,329
- It's okay just lie
 down, like your mom said.

607
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:57,967
          Have a chip.

608
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,369
     - Okay, salt is good.

609
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,438
     - Hey, you know what
      I've been thinking?

610
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:06,609
 I've been thinking that I can
 come back to Toronto with you.

611
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:07,910
   We don't really fit here.

612
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,881
 - My mom says she doesn't fit
          here either.

613
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,350
- Are they gonna divorce?

614
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:16,786
        - I don't know.

615
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,059
 I think I should go home now.

616
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:23,960
             - No.

617
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,430
 Hey, do you wanna borrow this?

618
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,867
   I can loan it to you, and
    you can get here faster.

619
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,703
  The brakes don't really work
  that good, but that's okay.

620
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:35,405
   Never slam on the brakes.

621
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:38,441
  Otherwise, you'll go flying
  over the handlebars and die.

622
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,976
      - Kate? It's dinner.

623
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:41,944
Tell your girlfriend to go home,
             okay?

624
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:49,118
   - She acts mad, it's just
 because she's lonely, see ya!

625
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,525
   Hey! They're my favorite.

626
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:58,461
    Put them in your pocket.

627
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,362
           - Thanks.

628
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,259
       - Come on. I know.

629
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,662
 Bea, can you help me a second?

630
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:34,697
- What happened?

631
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:35,865
     - Just hold him still.

632
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,306
 - Do you think he's possessed?

633
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,908
      - No, I don't think
        he's possessed.

634
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,376
  He's got a thorn in his paw.

635
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:53,583
 - You're so brave, I love you.

636
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,787
- You're a lucky boy,
    eh?

637
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,123
     You're a lucky dog to
     be loved by this one.

638
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,599
      There you go, hey,
       who's a good dog?

639
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:32,989
     - I'm sorry for what I
   said to you this morning.

640
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:37,627
     Of course I never want
    you to faint, I'm sorry.

641
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,395
          - It's okay.

642
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,435
    - There's lots of other
    girls up here, you know?

643
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,371
  You could make more friends.

644
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,039
I don't wanna make more friends.

645
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,377
     - I just think you and
    Kate have been spending

646
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:55,211
     a lot of time together

647
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,746
    - She's my best friend.

648
00:46:56,748 --> 00:46:57,647
           - I know.

649
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,356
  If something's on my mind, I
want to feel like I can talk to

650
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,727
  you about it, and you should
 feel like you can talk to me.

651
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,529
      We're a team, right?

652
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:14,430
            - Yeah.

653
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,404
   - Well, is there anything
 you want to talk to me about?

654
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,543
 - Could Kate come back with us
          to Toronto?

655
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:29,946
            - What?

656
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:33,149
 - She feels like she's adopted
   and she doesn't fit here.

657
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,517
             - No.

658
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,985
  - Why couldn't she just come
           with us at

659
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:36,853
     the end of the summer?

660
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,287
             - No!
             - Why?

661
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:40,623
  - Because she's not adopted.

662
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,559
      Her family is here,
      and she has school.

663
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:44,961
   - She can change schools.

664
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:45,895
           - No, Bea.

665
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:48,497
 - Then what if I stayed here?

666
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,200
   - We're not staying here.

667
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,003
- Apple pie is ready!

668
00:47:57,609 --> 00:47:59,475
       - Are you and Dad
       getting a divorce?

669
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,312
             - No.

670
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:04,647
           - Promise?

671
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:08,050
- Yes, I'll bring you some pie.

672
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,386
  - Maybe could Kate come live
            with us?

673
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,287
          - We'll see.

674
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,362
- Thank you.

675
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:27,930
       - You're welcome.

676
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,601
        Can I have some?

677
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:38,407
Thank you.

678
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:39,909
     - Hey, Ally, what time
      do you want us back?

679
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,944
         - Six o'clock.
         - Sounds good.

680
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,084
    - Are we going swimming?

681
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,451
- No menus,
  fries to go, please.

682
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:50,853
            - Sure.
             - Mom?

683
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,588
  Are we still going swimming?

684
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,589
             - Yes.

685
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:54,890
            - When?
            - Soon.

686
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,911
      - You can have one,
      I'm not having any.

687
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:17,847
     - Oh, thank you, we're
      going to keep going.

688
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,015
       - Want to buy one?
             - No.

689
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:22,151
  - Mommy, you can have one,
         go, go, okay!

690
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,386
          - Hey, Bea.

691
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,021
        Oh, that's nice.

692
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:29,325
  I'll have three three tipis
    and two canoes, please.

693
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:30,960
           - Really?

694
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,594
      - Yeah, I'm going to
    make a mobile with them.

695
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:34,530
   My sister just had a baby.

696
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,364
         I'm an uncle.

697
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,432
      That's cool, right?

698
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:37,867
      - Yeah, that's cool.

699
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,435
        - Was born blue.

700
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:42,104
  The cord was wrapped around
     her neck three times,

701
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,540
 but her fists were like this.

702
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,075
      Gonna be a fighter.

703
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:48,044
My sister had to be knocked out,
            though.

704
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:52,782
   I could never be a parent,
            goodbye!

705
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:54,250
        - Thanks, Emile!

706
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,926
         I made $5.00!
          - Fantastic.

707
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,669
         - I wanna go.

708
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:51,640
- I asked my mom about
 moving to Toronto with you.

709
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:52,708
- What did she say?

710
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,909
- She said go ahead,

711
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:56,679
     but she said there's
        no way your mom

712
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:57,646
         would say yes,

713
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:02,651
     did you ask your mom?

714
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:03,552
            - Yeah.

715
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,653
      - What did she say?

716
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,489
    - She said, "We'll see."

717
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:07,923
    - She said, "We'll see?"

718
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:08,891
       That's like a yes!

719
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:10,159
 - I don't think she meant yes.

720
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:12,361
      - I'm so coming to
       Toronto with you!

721
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,665
     Could we share a room?

722
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:17,867
   - We could share my room.

723
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:18,868
    It's not that big, but--

724
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,536
- We can go to the same school!

725
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,938
  - Yeah! We'll have Mr. Grey.

726
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,307
  He picks his nose and hides
 it in his beard all the time,

727
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,709
         but he's nice.

728
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,961
  - This is my favorite place.

729
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:48,264
    You're the first person
    I've ever brought here.

730
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,292
      - Oh, it's so slimy
         on the bottom.

731
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:18,060
- Don't touch
   the bottom.

732
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,675
            Gotcha!

733
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,215
        - Oh my God, ah!

734
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:11,914
    Are there any poisonous
      snakes around here?

735
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:12,881
       - Yeah, probably.

736
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:15,084
             - Oh.

737
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:20,656
   Well, once, I went hiking
 with my dad when I was little,

738
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,759
    and one was that close.

739
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:28,330
   You could hear the rattle
  and Callum tried to save me.

740
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:32,268
  He was just a puppy, and he
 was going to bite it, but then

741
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:37,339
  my dad picked up a rock and
smashed it on the snake's head.

742
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,507
         - Did it die?

743
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,309
            - Yeah.

744
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:43,312
  - That's a really sad story.

745
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,850
 Hey, I know a secret hideout.

746
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:49,885
        - My dad says we
   shouldn't go off the path.

747
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,287
    - Do you always do what
         your dad says?

748
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,855
            Come on!

749
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:53,689
            - Kate!

750
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:55,257
      - I wanna show you!
           - Wait up!

751
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,363
            Got you!
           - Ssshht!

752
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:07,236
 - Okay, Billy, let's do this.
            - Okay.

753
00:55:07,238 --> 00:55:08,103
       Oh, shit, hold on.

754
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,271
          You got it?
       - Yeah, hurry up.

755
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:11,707
     - What are they doing?
        - We need to go.

756
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,676
     - No, we have to stay.
         - Pull it up.

757
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,044
           - Please.
           - Ssshht!

758
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:17,146
     - Okay, tie it down to
    that tree or something.

759
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,047
         - I'm scared.

760
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:19,782
    - You're always scared!

761
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,050
    Don't be such a chicken!

762
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:24,420
     - Hello, who's there?
             - Hey!

763
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,305
    Hey, what are you doing!

764
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:28,189
     - Kate, Jesus Christ!
     - Is that Nick's dog?

765
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:29,708
   - Get the hell outta here!

766
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:31,225
 - What did you do to his dog?
 - It's none of your business!

767
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,795
        - Hey, shut up!

768
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:33,896
   We have to do this, Kate.

769
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:34,981
  It's none of your business.
         - Romeo stop!

770
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:36,065
       You're hurting me!
    - You shouldn't be here!

771
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:37,333
- Bea help me!

772
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:38,167
             - No!

773
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,802
    - Get outta here, okay?

774
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:41,270
       Go home, now! Run!

775
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,773
    - Dude, we gotta bounce.
           - Ah shit!

776
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,375
        Billy, help me.

777
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,377
         Kate, come on.
          - My head...

778
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,546
- We've gotta
  get out of here, man.

779
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:51,513
- Lift her up.

780
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,059
             - Hey!

781
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:11,800
         Never squeal.

782
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:19,641
             Kate!

783
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,180
      Kate, where are you?

784
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,017
             Kate!

785
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:41,230
          Don't faint.

786
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,066
      Please do not faint.

787
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,981
       Stop being scared.

788
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:48,797
- Come on, Pipe,
  it's not that hard.

789
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,199
        You can do this.

790
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:56,371
      Bea, there you are.

791
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:58,240
       Can you help Joy
      blow some balloons?

792
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,011
 - I can't blow balloons right
           now, Mom.

793
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,480
- What? Of course
   you can.

794
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,048
   Eric, go check on Scotty.

795
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:10,452
      - I'll check on him.

796
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:12,287
            - Okay.

797
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:14,356
            Thanks.

798
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:19,127
- Come over here, baby.

799
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:20,796
       Over here, buddy.

800
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,931
  Can Mommy see your balloon?

801
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:23,966
        We can compare.

802
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:25,834
- Dad?

803
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,771
     - Hey, look at these.

804
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:30,772
  Emile did most of the work,

805
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:33,008
     but I'm the finishing
          touches guy.

806
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,976
      How's my buttercup?

807
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:38,013
  - I'm not a buttercup...Dad.

808
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,147
        - I know. Okay.

809
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,716
     I'm never calling you
          that again.

810
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:42,751
        How's Forsythia?

811
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,052
      Forsythias are cool.

812
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,193
          - Hey, Ally!
    - Hey, come on in, guys!

813
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,528
    - Do you need any help
         with anything?

814
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,263
- No, I think we're
 just finishing up here.

815
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:55,898
           - Awesome!
   - Grab yourself some beer!

816
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,367
         - What is it?
       - It looks great.

817
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,201
             - Hey!
             - Hi!

818
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,435
     - Did you go swimming?

819
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:02,321
            - Yeah.

820
00:59:02,322 --> 00:59:04,206
     - Okay, well, put your
     wet stuff in the sink.

821
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,541
          Grab a cake.

822
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,209
     - Scotty, get in here!
           - Coming.

823
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,511
       - They're coming,
        they're coming.

824
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,812
   Ssshht, okay, okay they're
      coming, go, go, go.

825
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:12,915
      The birthday girls!

826
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:16,718
- Happy birthday!

827
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:21,924
         - Party time.

828
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:24,760
- And there's cake!

829
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:28,096
        - Look at that.
            - Nice.

830
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:29,531
          - All right.
          - Beautiful.

831
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,341
- Happy birthday,
 I wanna be part of this.

832
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:42,110
   - It's not your birthday.
 - I know, it's their birthday.

833
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:55,157
- Thank you.

834
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,563
          - Thank you!
             - Hey.

835
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:58,987
- Hey.

836
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:03,191
    - I wanted to bring back
  Kate's bike and her clothes.

837
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:06,895
- Okay, thanks.

838
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:10,399
  - I really need to see her.

839
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:12,934
 - Well, she's at the hospital
          with my mom.

840
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:14,469
- Is she okay?

841
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:15,470
      - Yeah, she's fine.

842
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:17,039
 She just had a bit of a fall.

843
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:19,207
      - Is she mad at me?

844
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,976
 - Why would she be mad at you?

845
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:39,594
    Look, I think you should
      just stay away from

846
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,229
     my sister for a while.

847
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:42,130
             - Why?

848
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,933
- Because you're
 causing trouble for her.

849
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,334
  - How am I causing trouble?

850
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,976
    I brought her some candy
     they're her favorites.

851
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,312
      - Okay. Go home now.

852
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:47,863
   - I can think of something
    you haven't done before.

853
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:48,764
           - Oh yeah?

854
01:02:51,502 --> 01:02:52,467
            - Okay.

855
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:55,604
  First, there's seven cards
         all together.

856
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:57,139
 The first one is turned over.

857
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:58,540
    - Tell me, are you one?

858
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:00,575
- Are you two?

859
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:02,310
         Are you three?

860
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,045
         Are you four?

861
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:05,680
         Are you five?

862
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,415
          Are you six?

863
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,117
         Are you seven?

864
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,685
         Are you eight?

865
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:12,320
         Are you nine?

866
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,922
          Are you 10?

867
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:15,323
          Are you 11?

868
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,291
     - Okay, that's enough.

869
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,325
- Are you 12?

870
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:18,994
          Are you 13?

871
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,061
          Are you 14?

872
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,631
          Are you 15?

873
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:24,232
          Are you 16?

874
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:25,667
          Are you 17?

875
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:27,202
          Are you 18?

876
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:28,036
          Are you 19?

877
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,337
       - So she couldn't
        hold it anymore.

878
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,539
- Are you 20?

879
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,207
          Are you 21?
             - Mom?

880
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:34,509
  - Bea, where have you been?

881
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:37,312
 - I had to return Kate's bike.

882
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,647
- Aw, you missed
   the cake.

883
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,682
- It was some really good cake.

884
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:41,883
     You can use this one.
         - Are you 27?

885
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:44,119
          Are you 28?
           - Thanks.

886
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:45,453
      - So what happened?
         - Are you 29?

887
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:48,890
     - So she just pissed
         on the floor,

888
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,325
right there, in the restaurant.

889
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,460
  - Oh, that's something I've
          never done.

890
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:54,396
- Exactly see,
   I told you!

891
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:56,431
      - I'm going to bed.
         - Are you 36?

892
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,567
   - Oh, no, honey come on,
         stay with us.

893
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:04,372
 Oh lord, what is going on out
          here, whoa.

894
01:04:04,374 --> 01:04:06,508
     - I'm okay! I'm okay.

895
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,742
        No broken bones.

896
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:10,946
   I think we should slow it
   down a little bit, though,

897
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:11,913
       if you don't mind.

898
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,751
      - Where did Bea go?
        - She just left.

899
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:28,964
        - You want some?

900
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:58,360
    - How are you so happy
         all the time?

901
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:35,730
              Mom?

902
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,578
              Mom?

903
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:15,103
      Mom, what happened?

904
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:20,208
  - Tonight was good, I think.

905
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,276
          I was happy.

906
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:23,478
        Were you happy?

907
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,546
       You seemed happy.

908
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:26,815
         - Is Dad okay?

909
01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:30,819
- Wait a minute.

910
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,220
     What's going on here?

911
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:35,023
  - Well, what do you think is
   going on, Bea can see you.

912
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:39,160
      - Hmm, not an idiot.
           - Really?

913
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,962
  - Do you think I'm an idiot?

914
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:41,863
        - That's enough.

915
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,367
- Leave
   me alone.

916
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:47,902
       - Can I help you?

917
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,639
       - I'm fine, honey.

918
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,507
 Please, just go back to sleep,
             okay?

919
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:58,446
    - I just need to give me
    a little bit of credit.

920
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:02,751
     - What about me, what
    kind of credit do I get?

921
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:05,553
 - Well, it would depend on how
          much credit

922
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,056
 you think you need, 'cause it
  doesn't ever really seem to

923
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:09,257
           be enough.

924
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:12,327
     Thank you so much for
    taking the orders, Ally.

925
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:15,463
  Thank you so much for doing
    this other thing, Ally.

926
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:20,335
Bea, I'm sorry,
 can you help me, please?

927
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:25,373
No, Bea, I'll tell you, she gets it.

928
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,374
Gets what?

929
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:28,877
No, please stop!

930
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,111
Don't do that.

931
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:35,817
I'm so sorry, darling, I'm sorry.

932
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:40,989
It's this place, Scotty.

933
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:43,792
It is not this place.

934
01:07:43,794 --> 01:07:46,628
I love this place, and Bea
loves this place, right?

935
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,569
Bea gets it.

936
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,673
She cares unlike you.

937
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:00,025
That is not fair! That's not fair!

938
01:08:00,026 --> 01:08:01,376
So why don't we just
let this whole place burn?

939
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,212
  - All right, Bea, go back to
           your bed.

940
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,647
  - We should probably just...

941
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:13,021
   If you hate this place so
    much, just let it burn!

942
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:14,055
           - Shut up!

943
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:21,396
           I'm done.

944
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:36,578
       - No, you're not.

945
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,702
             - Bea.

946
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:01,569
            Wake up.

947
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:03,505
         We need to go.

948
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:04,305
- Where?

949
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,273
      - We're leaving now.

950
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:06,975
            - What?

951
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:08,476
- Get up, get dressed.

952
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,045
            Come on.

953
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:15,350
         - Where's Dad?

954
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:16,317
          - Let's go.

955
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:19,020
     - Why don't you ever
         listen to me?

956
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:20,355
       - Ssshht, not now!

957
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,725
- What about Callum?

958
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,627
- Dad needs Callum
   to stay here.

959
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,996
     - I have to see Kate.

960
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:29,230
       - Get in the car.

961
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:59,427
        - You promised.

962
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:00,495
- I didn't promise
   anything.

963
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:01,396
           - You did.

964
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:04,032
    - I've been trying, Bea.

965
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,301
  Your dad's been trying too.

966
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:10,138
        It doesn't work.

967
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,277
  He doesn't listen, and it's
  been building and building.

968
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:17,946
 I don't know what else to do.

969
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,283
              Bea!

970
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:26,187
        Bea, oh, my God!

971
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,490
      Oh, my god, hold on.

972
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:32,493
    I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

973
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,797
  It's gonna be okay, hold on.

974
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:37,632
            Scotty!

975
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:43,304
         Scotty, help!

976
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,509
   It's Bea, she jumped out
          of the car.

977
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:53,581
- What?

978
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,288
        Bea, don't move.

979
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,043
         - Hey, honey.

980
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:24,379
        - Hi, beautiful.

981
01:11:26,549 --> 01:11:29,550
- Do you need anything?

982
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:30,618
        - Is Kate here?

983
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:33,721
- I don't know.

984
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,058
            - Daddy?

985
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:39,260
          - I'm here.

986
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:46,768
    - How's everybody doing?

987
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,735
       - We're all right.

988
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:49,637
- I'm Dr. Roe.

989
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,706
Do you remember me from earlier?

990
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,141
            - Yeah.

991
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:55,576
- Do you still have
   your headache?

992
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:56,778
             - No.

993
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,929
            - Okay.

994
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,079
      I'm just gonna have
    you sit up for a moment

995
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,982
    so I can have a listen
         to your chest.

996
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:04,752
           That's it.

997
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:12,994
     And big breath and out

998
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:19,100
       and again and out.

999
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:20,001
             Great.

1000
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:25,139
    And just look over here
      with your eyes only,

1001
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:26,841
       and the other way.

1002
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:27,775
    Great, and you can lay
          back again.

1003
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:34,115
      So I've reviewed the
    CAT scan and the x-rays,

1004
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:36,751
        and thankfully,
     everything looks good.

1005
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:38,853
  That was quite a tumble you
         took, though.

1006
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:42,023
      Were you trying to
         hurt yourself?

1007
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:42,924
             - No.

1008
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,893
- Why did you jump out of
   the car?

1009
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:50,698
   - So I could be with Kate.

1010
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:53,868
- Kate is your friend?

1011
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,674
   - She thinks I'm chicken,
          but I'm not.

1012
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,243
- You're not a chicken?

1013
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,278
             - No.

1014
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:12,587
    And I don't want my mom
   and dad to fight anymore.

1015
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:16,657
          - All right.

1016
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:19,026
   I'm going to talk to your
   mom and dad for a minute.

1017
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,361
         Is that okay?
            - Okay.

1018
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:22,764
            - Okay.

1019
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:30,972
        - Be right back.

1020
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,650
    Ssshht, it's okay, okay.

1021
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:02,804
  - Well, we've been separated
     for about three months

1022
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:07,508
    me living up here, them
      living in the city.

1023
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:14,449
   - She's never talked about
    hurting herself before?

1024
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,517
   Did she show any signs of
        depression over

1025
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:20,121
     the last few months or
    the past year in school?

1026
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:24,192
     - No so we're good to
         take her home?

1027
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:31,532
- Kate?

1028
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:32,834
   - You look worse than me.

1029
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,009
 Did they bring you any Jell-O?

1030
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:42,910
- Not yet.

1031
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:49,150
- They said I could go
   home today.

1032
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:50,117
       - That's so great,

1033
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:54,689
     I'm sorry I ran away.

1034
01:14:56,426 --> 01:14:57,425
- It's okay.

1035
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,830
     - But I didn't squeal.

1036
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,132
    I didn't tell on Romeo.

1037
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:08,102
      It was really hard.

1038
01:15:12,242 --> 01:15:14,709
    - Is it true you jumped
         out of a car?

1039
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:15,610
- Yeah.

1040
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:18,446
- You're even crazier than I am.

1041
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:23,284
     I got seven stitches,
         right across.

1042
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:24,352
- Wow.

1043
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,725
- Romeo confessed about the dog.

1044
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:32,793
 The cops came and everything.

1045
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:33,694
- Really?

1046
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:36,764
- He's gonna get some help now.

1047
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,834
My mom says I'm a tough cookie.

1048
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,474
 - I wish I was a tough cookie.

1049
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:48,276
- You are.

1050
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:56,744
             - Hey.

1051
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,049
            - Kate?

1052
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,284
             - Bea!
            - Kate!

1053
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:07,455
- Wait up!

1054
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:30,144
- Kate can't go to Toronto with
           you, Bea.

1055
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:35,216
             - Mom?

1056
01:17:38,388 --> 01:17:39,286
          - I'm sorry.

1057
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:53,668
 - Can you unlock the door for
          me, please?

1058
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,568
           Thank you.

1059
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,278
      - If you're leaving,
     I wanna come with you.

1060
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,814
   - What about your family?

1061
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,187
    - Jesus, Bea! I was just
            kidding.

1062
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,089
   You should see your face,
          so serious.

1063
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:19,360
   I mean, I can't actually
        come to Toronto.

1064
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:21,595
       I know we said it
        and everything.

1065
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:23,597
   - What's in the suitcase?

1066
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:25,566
 - Oh, it's just Lola's stuff.

1067
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:27,468
She said I could sell it, so...

1068
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:33,507
You could come visit,
I want you to.

1069
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:38,379
Maybe, but I think my mom
really needs me right now...

1070
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:41,115
...to help with baby Lisa and
my brother Luke and stuff.

1071
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:46,353
I think my parents
really need me, too.

1072
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:56,063
The halter top,
it'll look really good on you.

1073
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,536
You're more than my best friend.

1074
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:04,872
I know.
