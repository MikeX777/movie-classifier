00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,632
The 15 Year Old Girl

2
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,319
Prologue: what I do it
is Thomas's desire...

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,992
Although he does not ask me to do so.

4
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,999
He has not called my mother.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,279
Or perhaps yes and he has not said
anything to me on purpose, out of jealousy

6
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,519
You can not count on him.

7
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
If we do not reserve,
we will not find a place.

8
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,679
Do not worry.

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,959
I hate to go on a trip, it worries me.

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,599
I'm afraid to let myself go.

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,159
You'll see, you may go without me.

12
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,119
I will call him to remind him.

13
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,079
Perhaps your father does not like
and his antiquated side goes out for him.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,999
No, I would have realized.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,199
Or perhaps he liked too much
and that gives me more disgust.

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,039
I'm going to see my mother.

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,315
- Are you going home to your father?
- No, I will go tomorrow.

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,759
Hello, sorry to bother you,
Is Thomas here?

19
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,759
I don't think he comes today.

20
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,638
But if you think it will happen,
you can wait for him.

21
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,479
- Sit down.
- I'd rather stand.

22
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,439
They all say that he can trust in you.

23
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,319
But you has not called my mother ...

24
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,959
I have not had time.

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,959
If you want your child
to yourself, alone ...

26
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,799
It's a mess to look after him at his age.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,995
It is just what my mother would do.

28
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,919
Do you really want to go?

29
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,673
Yes, but I will not call
not knowing where to go.

30
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,079
We could go to an island in Britain.

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,279
No, it's very cold, we can not swim.

32
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
- My father told me about Formentera.
- It was fashionable 20 years ago.

33
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,719
Yes, with the hippies,
but now it will be fine.

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,519
Surely there are only rednecks.

35
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,876
I was given directions to call.

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,557
On Saturdays there is direct flight.

37
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,399
Glad to meet you.

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,759
And me.

39
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,599
Even though I am angry with you.

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,559
But I will forget it if you call my mother.

41
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
If Thomas went without
me I could not bear it.

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,119
I do not like the words of feelings.

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,599
I can not say, "feel" or
"excite", it scares me.

44
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,159
And I cannot explain well about Thomas,

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,798
but I want to go with him.

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,039
I'm going, you can get Thomas.

47
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,314
Will not you wait?

48
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,799
Do not tell him that I came,

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,319
or that I waited, it would kill me.

50
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,673
It would not be right.

51
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,319
I want to go with Thomas
and I agree to go with you.

52
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,319
And if I insist, it is for Thomas.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,839
What I do is the desire of Thomas
but he does not ask me to do so.

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,114
Goodbye!

55
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,159
I have a comment on Friday.

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,239
Fortunately I do not know what to say.

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,159
- Do you stay the night?
- No.

58
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,071
But we can go to bed for an hour.

59
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
You have your parents
too stuck in your head.

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,596
We should be closer together.

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,238
If not, it is better to be alone.

62
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,354
Wake me if I fall asleep.

63
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,719
I call him because I thought about it.
My mother will not be able to refuse,

64
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,439
and as it's not known it
is better that I go home.

65
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,719
I will not have to stay.
In addition, she would not like it.

66
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,599
Why?

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,799
My mother is a woman of truth.

68
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,559
And then what?
After going home.

69
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,439
I will see my father.

70
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,799
I will accompany you.
You don't like it?.

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,879
Yes, sure, it is rather like a child

72
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,879
It is not a man, it's not like her.

73
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,079
She has long ceased to be a girl.

74
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,239
Never should have been.

75
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,708
Come to the address,
Sunday at two.

76
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,470
I have not eaten and I drank a little.
One glass and I'm tipsy.

77
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,799
As a child when I would not eat,
my father would try everything.

78
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,239
To distract me he would put on
a robe and a sombrero with a feather..

79
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
But I just got scared,
I hated the costumes.

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,759
I did not eat anything and on having gone
out of the school he bought me a ham slice.

81
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,359
A few days eating only lean
and others, only fat.

82
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,998
Never both together.

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,757
I am very unsociable.

84
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,919
When I love someone, I
first feel disgust, much disgust.

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,751
A monumental disgust for everything.

86
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,119
Then I often do.

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,716
Usually to get attention.
I'm afraid to go unnoticed.

88
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,559
- I worry about something.
- Not likely.

89
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,839
Do I look like a boy or a man?

90
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,599
As a boy.
I hope so!

91
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,839
If you are one, it is forever.

92
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,400
Well, it depends on people
and their ideas.

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,234
I have to run.

94
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,319
You will you call me, to see when we go?

95
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,079
Maybe before.

96
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,878
- Can I say that I've seen you?
- Yes, it was for my mother.

97
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,199
- Is it sure that she wants to come?
- Yes, apparently you did not call.

98
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,239
You could have done it.

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,958
You promised it, for mother.

100
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,239
I wanted to be sure.

101
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,915
You are never sure of anything.
What did you want to be sure?

102
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,152
- Your girlfriend worries me.
- Are you afraid?

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,599
I do not know what that will be there.

104
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,636
I ...  and you two.

105
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,235
I do not know why you're together.

106
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,999
Perhaps security.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,799
Is that what she is, security?
Furthermore, it is indiscreet.

108
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,719
I know.

109
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,110
I do not expect an answer,
I was asking myself, not you.

110
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,799
I get bored with the girls of my age.

111
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,719
She's the same.

112
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,393
Those of my age or older
only think about sex.

113
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,509
In addition, she is just like a boy.

114
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,989
But better.

115
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,399
I've said too much.

116
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,277
I'm going to smoke, I'm nervous.

117
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,599
You can, but Lucky is
smoked without a filter.

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,879
Since you'll buy them for me,

119
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,792
I'll buy Craven,
the package is nice.

120
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,959
And spare me stupid questions.

121
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,029
Sorry.

122
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,839
Do you have homework?

123
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,512
Yes, I will do it at mom's.

124
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,319
Last night I dreamed
that your father had died.

125
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,959
He was old and died,
A very strange feeling!

126
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,837
You should call him.

127
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,719
I have to tell you three things but I do
not remember the order, it was logical.

128
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,153
Let me think.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,799
You have to draw from the best of
people, what they have in mind.

130
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,279
That, first.

131
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,119
Two: if you start something, you finish it.

132
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,399
Though your not sure at first.
The end must be beautiful.

133
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,159
It is necessary.

134
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,755
It may not be clear, I have it
clear and I can not be clearer.

135
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,799
Three: I'm afraid of your father.
I do not know how to say it, but ...

136
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,189
Do not, because "you do not know how."

137
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,919
- It is also ironic.
- Sarcastic.

138
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,679
- What is the difference?
- Sarcastic is against others.

139
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,759
Regarding your dream,
I have spoken with him,

140
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,879
He seemed to be alive, would you call?

141
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,075
- Is that sarcastic?
Yes.

142
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,879
He did not call my mother for hours.

143
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,950
I saw the bills.
- All three?

144
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,598
Today this is heavy, right?

145
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,959
I'm going.

146
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,999
Do you call me?  I do not call
but he has to call my mother.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,839
- Will you swim?
- Yes.

148
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,116
- Without a swimsuit for security?
- Yes, unless there is nobody.

149
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,079
Where did you buy it?

150
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,119
I will ask my uncle, he
only thinks about clothes.

151
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,109
Do you call me?

152
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,277
- Do you call me?
Yes.

153
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,159
Day one: it is forbidden to stare at me
so. Especially if it's you.

154
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,319
The house is common but this is great.

155
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,072
It is really nice.

156
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,439
- The sea!
Yes.

157
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,439
The sea is truly magnificent.

158
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,793
Completely blue.

159
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,879
With the sun the color
changes continuously.

160
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,039
Here an exiled saint lived.

161
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,879
He founded the Carmelite missionaries.

162
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,679
Six years later, he went on missions.

163
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,959
From the inside out, Thomas. Always.

164
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,159
- Is it much distance to swim?
- 500 Meters.

165
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,479
I do not advise it, there
are very strong currents.

166
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,279
And on what was the saint living?

167
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,359
In Velra there was always
fresh water and rabbits.

168
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,959
You have to like the
rabbit and I do not like.

169
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,871
- Will it do well?
- Yes.

170
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,399
- I left the swimming pool as they asked.
- Perfect, I hate swimming pools.

171
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,919
- Is it possible to get on the terrace?
- Yes, inside.

172
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,718
Take the keys, the papers are inside.

173
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,159
My room.

174
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,668
Yours.

175
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,479
And your father.

176
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,198
And over there above, the terrace.

177
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,955
What did your father do on the plane?

178
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,836
Nothing.

179
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,710
He seemed happy to leave.

180
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,479
Was he not looking at us?

181
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,311
Not, he was looking at you.

182
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,997
Not in an insistent way,
but he was looking at you.

183
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,589
- He wasn't staring at me with insistence?
- No.

184
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,439
Furtively?

185
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,000
No, not pushy or furtively.

186
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,839
Then carefully.

187
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,513
So I saw.

188
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,270
Let him look, it happens.

189
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,910
No, no way, he was not looking at you.

190
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,599
It is disgusting to notice a filthy look.

191
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,999
It makes everything dirty.

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,275
Including us, if you do nothing.

193
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,239
It's under your supervision.

194
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,719
And what you think,
also I will think it.

195
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,551
Do not become nervous.

196
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,233
- Are we going to swim?
- Yes.

197
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,119
Not bad.

198
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,314
With one hand.

199
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
- I'll dislodge the jaw.
- Wait.

200
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,159
It's like if you did so ...

201
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,799
See?  See how easy it is.

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,959
It's great!

203
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,632
I hurt my throat!

204
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,519
I do not like dark skin,
I prefer transparent.

205
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,479
The black goes with blond streaks,
like my mother's friends.

206
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,159
Unfortunately, I tan quickly.

207
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,628
And luckily, I will soon.

208
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,595
Are you coming?

209
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,915
Are you coming?

210
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,989
We're going.

211
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,839
I know what you'll say, I disagree.

212
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,439
- I am not interested in the looks.
- He was not looking at you for you.

213
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,070
Yes, when you were looking at me you had
his look in your eyes, like a mirror.

214
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,999
It's like swimming.

215
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,959
You can do it naked
if nobody looks at you.

216
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,430
But if someone looks at you,
even in swimsuit, it's uncomfortable.

217
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,638
He is prohibited to look at me that way.
Especially, if you should see it.

218
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,751
I have to get away from his look.

219
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,275
Simply look at me, it's very clever.

220
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,439
If I leave, I'm just a wimp.

221
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,396
Too mush exaggeration,
is a pain in the ass.

222
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,479
You always want to say things as they are.

223
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,159
We say what happens.

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,239
And I try, because I admire that in you.

225
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,679
Do not approach and point,
we will be together.

226
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,239
Tomorrow we will go to the island,
nobody will look at you.

227
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,913
Spend the day without it.

228
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,919
Can you turn it down?

229
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,919
- You do not like?
- No.

230
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,753
Makes you want to mourn
Although there is no desire to.

231
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,790
When will you stop looking at me?

232
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,873
It's not you who interests me but your age.

233
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,749
And your age does not matter to me,
it is quite disagreeable.

234
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,159
I am interested in your age
from what it produces:

235
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,639
speed of execution in the phrase,

236
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,839
and as they pass the feelings to your face.

237
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,149
Very fast and very visibly.

238
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,719
But what you usually say
is not predictable.

239
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,153
As if you were younger.

240
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,030
I do not know how you can preserve
it and remain in such a state.

241
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,959
You still have a sense of joy, humor.

242
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,359
You are happier, so you're better.

243
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,319
Thomas is simpler than you

244
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,199
His aim is to make me say: " Ah, yes! "

245
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,439
Makes it impossible for him
to say, and he is content.

246
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,670
Also you say very well: " Oh, no! ".

247
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,199
With so much enthusiasm!

248
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,359
Only the end falls down with
regard to: " Ah, yes! "

249
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,429
It is very convenient.

250
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,639
I never said: "Oh, no!"

251
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,919
Since you arrived you say it your way.

252
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,319
Without pronouncing, but I hear very well.

253
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,514
Yes, really.

254
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,033
That's funny.

255
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,479
I like to read, I do not
like when you read.

256
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,114
Are you angry?

257
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,512
Do you have grounds?

258
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,833
Protect yourself or you
will feel my motives.

259
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,599
Let's play.

260
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,639
The test is to seduce the father and
to make him fall down to escape from him.

261
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,919
By day, pretend that nothing happens.

262
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,592
And at night, everything is dangerous.

263
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,274
I love you.
Neither brother nor sister, more than that.

264
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,879
Day 2: Thomas and I, we decided ...
nothing.

265
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,950
Do not do anything, annoyed with it all.

266
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,839
Room Service.

267
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,237
Room Service.

268
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,599
This morning I am attracted by
the perfection of the world.

269
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,039
I know it will not last
but I can not say otherwise.

270
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,439
You're quite right.

271
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,359
At your age, you feel good
almost every morning.

272
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,319
You do not understand the scope
of my metaphysical reflection.

273
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,959
No, not metaphysical.

274
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,439
But if you think today the
world is nice, I trust you.

275
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,279
As you do not usually
like anything, I think.

276
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,599
- But not for long, of course.
- Of course.

277
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,999
- I hope.
- Do I take you in the car up to the top?

278
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,399
No, not necessary.

279
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,755
Good luck.

280
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,159
Sure you do not want to come?

281
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,479
I do not think I'll come,
although i want to be with you..

282
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,959
It's hardly 500 meters.

283
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,518
It is too far.

284
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,839
I promise I will not leave you,
we drown together.  Come!

285
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,114
No, I'm afraid.

286
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,872
I can not resist.

287
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,111
I love you in spite of everything.
What counts is not the swimmer.

288
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,675
If you are not going, pick up my clothes.

289
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,315
Forget the picnic!

290
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,388
What?

291
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,353
I chickened out. I didn't even
expect to see him go.

292
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,319
He was so far away, I no longer saw him.

293
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,550
He was just a speck in the sea.

294
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,359
If something happens to him,
we will not be able to alert anyone.

295
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,669
No need to worry.

296
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,679
I trust him too much.

297
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,990
I have not done the right thing,
I should have stopped him.

298
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,599
And now I have fear.

299
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,273
Do not be afraid, Thomas would not like it.

300
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,232
I am going to Thomas' room.

301
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,549
Can not sleep?

302
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,559
No.

303
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,152
- Are you better?
- Not much.

304
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,916
Tell me a story about Thomas.

305
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,679
At 4 years old he asked me to take off
the training wheels on his bike.

306
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,239
I refused, I was afraid he would get hurt.

307
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,277
His mother was so insistent
that I relented.

308
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,119
He mounted it and went away, as
if his whole life he had done it.

309
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,959
I accused him of having practiced
with a friend, but no.

310
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,839
He had awakened saying
"I know cycling," and it was true.

311
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,829
He was right.

312
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,079
Kleine schlafmütze,

313
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,159
I went for Thomas, to
turn him toward the right way.

314
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,358
You've been sleeping. If you sleep
well, anything can happen.

315
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,113
Yes it is far but not too great for Thomas.

316
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,839
There is no danger.

317
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,876
There is no point staying here.

318
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,999
Yes, better to wait at home.

319
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,639
You're right, he may have arrived.

320
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,436
Yes.

321
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,759
What does it mean
"Kleine schlafmüze"?

322
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,432
The little sleeper.

323
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,074
How beautiful!

324
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,239
Thomas and I have decided something ...

325
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,231
We don't anything, annoyed with it all.

326
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,994
Then, we shall see

327
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,039
If this was like with the others,
it would be terrible.

328
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,314
But I do not believe.

329
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,229
Although I also think
I do not care.

330
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,914
If I do not love the boy,
it is sure that it does not affect me.

331
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,439
I do not like subservient guys.

332
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,752
The guys I met at 14 years
were wild and independent.

333
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,039
At 16, are no longer wild..

334
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,519
It's a difficult age.

335
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,719
They start thinking about sex and
violence, it tickles them.

336
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,914
Later, it is the same.

337
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,674
As they begin thinking about sex ...

338
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,276
When I met Thomas he was
not thinking about that.

339
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,719
Thinking without thinking.

340
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,119
I can not explain, it's much nicer.

341
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,279
He believes that he does not think
about it but yes it does it.

342
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,032
Yademás, can be jealous

343
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,759
To make a boy become jealous, it
is necessary to count up to 100.

344
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,353
Come on, he says.

345
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,799
One, two, three, four, five,

346
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,677
six, seven, eight, nine ...

347
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,359
One, two, three,

348
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,555
four, five ...

349
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,399
The island was worthless,
there was not one bird.

350
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,319
Only beer cans and so many rabbits that I
could have pulled them up by the ears,

351
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,039
as carrots.

352
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,039
I should have brought one.

353
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,039
I was only an hour because
I saw an old tower

354
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,839
that only is seen from there,
and I went up it.

355
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,239
- And it was very nice.
- And now you're hungry.

356
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,673
Yes.
Well.

357
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,076
You're a pig, a savage.

358
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,079
I missed you.

359
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,718
And I love you.

360
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,879
Do you feel that we should
not be like the others?

361
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,552
We are not like others.

362
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,876
If we start, we are ready.

363
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,273
The idea that you can be
a boy like the others ...

364
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,476
It does not have to be difficult,
if it is a test, it is absurd.

365
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,559
Today I want to sleep with you.

366
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,755
But I will sleep in your bed.

367
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,835
Get out.

368
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,399
No creeping around the house this evening?

369
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,277
No, I will not be a mouse.

370
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,559
I've bundled a fresh cigar.

371
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,199
Do you see anyone?

372
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,719
Do you believe that I need
it to make fun myself?

373
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,153
Here, for the road.

374
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,754
When we leave will we miss the house?

375
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,035
You think so?

376
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,430
- Good night.
- Good night.

377
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,999
Day Three: the pledge is to seduce
to your father so that he falls down

378
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,230
and to get rid of him ...
especially if you want.

379
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,510
I understand that he is dead but
he cannot pass the day sleeping.

380
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,479
When I was 14 years I was
in love with a girl of 15.

381
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,559
I just wanted to be in
love, I never kissed her.

382
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,993
It would have been terrible.

383
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,757
It lasted me years, and it had to last,
it was made for that.

384
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,792
I do not believe that she found out.

385
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,159
I saw her every Sunday.

386
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,675
I knew her until the registration
of  her father's car.

387
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,599
In the winter she had a red leather coat,

388
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,033
and a green scarf.

389
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,550
Their number was: Nation 5876.

390
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,757
He circled the booths
and sometimes entered.

391
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,355
He even was calling one day
for some foolishnesses.

392
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,511
The excuse was mediocre,
but then he was so happy.

393
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,351
I think I'm in love with you.

394
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,638
I think that I do not love him.

395
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,079
I understand.

396
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,752
But it is still necessary to prove it.

397
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,074
Does you stay?

398
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,155
I think I'm in love with you.

399
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,637
I think that I do not love him

400
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,192
I think I'm in love with you.

401
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,992
I think I do not love him.

402
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,030
Before we were saying everything, now,
with your father, everything is tied.

403
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,991
What, again with the looks?

404
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,239
There are looks and words.

405
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,117
And what he says when you are not around.

406
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,599
- We will have a pledge.
- What?

407
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,318
Like when you play and then lose.

408
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,880
A pledge is to get another game.

409
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,079
And although he's done something
foolish, why continue?

410
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,479
Also, what game?

411
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,156
No need to invent a pledge.

412
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,515
No I have to settle the score
with my father.

413
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,599
Last night I said:

414
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,070
" The pledge is to seduce him so that
he falls down and to get rid of him ".

415
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,792
Especially if you want.

416
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,955
You do not remember, clearly,
you were sleeping.

417
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,679
It is not something against
him, but for us to be one.

418
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,319
When we fight, we are two people.

419
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,279
- I do it so that we do not separate.
- No, it is a sordid idea.

420
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,599
I disagree.

421
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,079
You asshole!

422
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,999
I will not sleep with him,
I just want him dizzy.

423
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,355
With an entire return, not with average.

424
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,551
So we will not part.

425
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,879
And what matters is the
end, it must be beautiful.

426
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,313
I do not think of anything else.

427
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,634
I disagree.

428
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,474
What are you doing?

429
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,799
I do not know.

430
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,916
Perhaps to return to the city.

431
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,473
Want to tell me something?

432
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,235
Of course not.

433
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,598
I withdraw everything previously mentioned.

434
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,839
I have never spoken to you about love.

435
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,273
And I have never kissed you.

436
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,752
He told me he was going to the agency.

437
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,233
I'm going to try again with him.

438
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,359
Jules!

439
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,475
I'm here!

440
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,199
Now you are interested in German?

441
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,395
It's a nice language to hear.

442
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,799
What does "schlafen"?  Small?

443
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,359
No, "sleep".

444
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,554
Or "sleeper", right?

445
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,239
- And "mütze" is "small"?
- No, that's "kleine".

446
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,356
- Why?
- No, it's nothing.

447
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,437
- I can look.
- It's not worth it.

448
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,315
"Cap"!

449
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,918
If you are going to "sleep"
it means "nightcap."

450
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,870
What is this "nightcap"?

451
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,835
Did you go to ask my father for one?

452
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,679
You are gili!

453
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,999
Probably be the person who takes it.

454
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,959
Yes, it will be that.

455
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,918
I tried to look for one one.
But this one is not bad.

456
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,439
She wears a sexy red dress.

457
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,839
He glances at her.

458
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,679
"What do you think?"  She says.

459
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,069
"I have a cold."  He says ...

460
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,396
"The nights are warm."

461
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,439
"Does he want my jersey?"

462
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,159
He speaks about us.

463
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,239
He says: "They are equal,
without actually being so. "

464
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,708
" They have the same grace,
the same exterior. "

465
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,039
If she is not the obsessed
one of the beauty

466
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,508
He will not understand
nothing of what she says.

467
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,919
- The girl gets them ready for...
- The woman!

468
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,719
So that it takes her to
the house along the sea.

469
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,755
Here?

470
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,679
No.

471
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,599
He thinks he should tell

472
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,799
things from your childhood for her to fall.

473
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,631
Things a bit poetic.

474
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,559
These two are beginning
to show a bit of disgust.

475
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,391
I prefer that she does not
speak to him about us.

476
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,113
If she brings it, it is that
he has a heart of stone.

477
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,512
Do you prefer in the car
or naked on the beach?

478
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,189
I prefer silence to hear bullshit.

479
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,511
I hope that she is the
one that he undresses.

480
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,799
She runs, does not realize
the ridiculous one,

481
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,519
everything moves her to
him, not a pretty sight.

482
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,317
Even he must laugh.

483
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,199
Well, what do we do?

484
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,553
- Do we swim?
- Yes.

485
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,670
Since your father is not here, no top.

486
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,349
We're good.

487
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,479
Perfectly fine.

488
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,839
I think it's perfect.

489
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,999
As the landscape.

490
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,719
Yes.

491
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,839
I do not like those rocks.

492
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,831
If I was living here, I
would order to throw them.

493
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,677
I would live happy here
all year, with you.

494
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,639
It is too hard, it scares me.

495
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,437
It is far from perfect!

496
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,276
Only my belly button is.

497
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,039
Show it to me, with the
swimsuit it is never seen.

498
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,999
Only one sees the half, on purpose.

499
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,879
Anyway, show.

500
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,839
The beauty, I hide.

501
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,239
A belly button is not taught
to anyone.

502
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,679
I'll show you later.

503
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,239
I am not just anyone.

504
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,719
What is so special?

505
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,319
That is beautiful!

506
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,799
It looks like a tear.

507
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,719
It's nice, huh?

508
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,280
It is transparent, almost invisible.

509
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,119
I'm sure he has not been to the agency.

510
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,112
- If not, what has he gone to do?
- I do not know.

511
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,117
You want to run away from it?

512
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,473
Has he kissed her?

513
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,229
Whom should he have kissed?

514
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,031
Anyway, I hate you.

515
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,753
You believe that it is a luck
to meet someone as you?

516
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,828
Go to sleep.

517
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,039
And you, go to sleep?

518
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,879
Not right now.

519
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,559
I'm not very friendly
with the bogey-man.

520
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,439
Better.

521
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,477
I don't like the day people,
I prefer the night.

522
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,439
Day Four: I have become
a girl as like others.

523
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,476
I cannot see the difference ...
you are right.

524
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,279
You do not eat breakfast?

525
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,872
No, later.

526
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,519
Do we eat in the restaurant?

527
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,509
It costs.

528
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,199
I am not ashamed what happens to you.

529
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,191
I never behaved worse with Thomas.

530
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,479
I know you do not like
me in a dirty way.

531
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,391
I want to say, in a nice way..

532
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,751
He was also nice.

533
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,152
This is a mess for Thomas.

534
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,755
Although against him it is
not possible to do anything.

535
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,596
When we all love all...

536
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,999
Do you come to swim?

537
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,399
No, I'm staying.

538
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,990
Why didn't you come to see me this morning?

539
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,199
I thought that the pledge is a good idea.

540
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,959
You had reason with the looks and stuff.

541
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,359
If he seems to you to be
disgusting, then show no mercy.

542
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,272
Annoy him completely, no half measures.

543
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,680
Although there is danger it
cannot do anything to us.

544
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,671
No one can harm us.

545
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,678
Can you leave me alone?

546
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,399
- What's up with the agency?
- What about the agency...

547
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,674
Well.

548
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,879
What I do not like here is the fact
that it is necessary to be seated.

549
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,439
At home how standing,
it is much more practical.

550
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,318
It falls so rapidly that
you do not put on weight.

551
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,439
Also, this way we have three dishes.

552
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,759
It would be better to eat
all in the same one.

553
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,954
I agree.

554
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,039
Then see you later in house.

555
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,839
If you are honest, there is
nothing to worry about.

556
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,239
I'll be there at six o'clock.

557
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,839
When you want to tell me, tell me.

558
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,150
- Nobody can separate us.
- Tell me at six.

559
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,674
Do not speak about him, he is not like you.

560
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,919
You make it impossible to live with him.

561
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,353
You are all dangerous.

562
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,039
Without sense of beauty,
it's not worth living.

563
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,474
And your taste for perfection is morbid.

564
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,594
What time is it?

565
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,715
Four.

566
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,276
I have become
a girl like the others.

567
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,198
I do not see the difference.

568
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,709
He's right.

569
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,999
The four and ten.

570
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,639
You did well to change your
dress, I prefer this one.

571
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,839
I hate those who do not
contain their desires.

572
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,239
"To those who?"

573
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,959
So I'm not alone?

574
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,359
Do you also include yourself?

575
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,759
I do not like the lexicon of feelings.

576
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,796
Do not get into it.

577
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,799
However, you said the word "desire."

578
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,759
And it can lead to feeling.

579
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,716
And also the most animal thing.

580
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,119
But, scarcely pronounced,

581
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,159
silently articulated, the word " love. "

582
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,239
Can you say it?

583
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,239
If there is a disgusting
expression it is: "Making love".

584
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,676
'Fuck' okay, but to 'make love'
in addition, it is not done

585
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,559
Yes a forbidden word,

586
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,679
Do you get tangled in the brain
Or are you stuck in your mouth?

587
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,159
It depends for whom.

588
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,598
For me, for example?

589
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,270
Though it was true, she
would not say it to him.

590
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,116
So bad she would be with him all the same?
I am surprised.

591
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,033
I think one of his qualities is honesty.

592
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,796
Talk about feelings but
you're a seducer, a pig.

593
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,553
We are all pigs.

594
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,959
Can I do a reading to you?

595
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,959
It is not obscene:
" To do a reading?"

596
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,949
I think not.

597
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,319
Unless you think it will
last until he returns,

598
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,880
it would be necessary to raise
the level of the conversation.

599
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,031
He returns at six o'clock exactly.

600
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,835
Do not think you are important to me.

601
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,989
Do not believe it.

602
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,352
I do not believe anything.

603
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,159
I Always arranged everything
in order that they loved me.

604
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,639
I was afraid that the
boys did not love me.

605
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,879
I was thinking: " If I don't do that,
already they will not love me."

606
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,599
It scares me if they do not love me.

607
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,239
Perhaps I do not want, I do not know...

608
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,913
It amounts to a lot of fuss.

609
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,359
When they were asking me to
do it once, I was agreeing.

610
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,639
But several, no.

611
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,119
I did it in order to say
it was because them.

612
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,839
Meanwhile they loved me or they
were feigning to love me...

613
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,559
It was because of them, but I did not care.

614
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,393
At first, I was so disgusted
at the idea of fucking.

615
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,194
I then accepted, but never more than once.

616
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,559
With Thomas I was afraid that
he was going to be like the others.

617
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,639
But we decided that between us
there would be nothing unusual.

618
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,518
He does not think as a boy,
and I don't take myself as a girl.

619
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,479
The first time I did it with a guy,

620
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,319
I rejected my femininity.

621
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,239
It was not his fault.

622
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,159
I cut my hair, I wanted to be a boy.

623
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,399
It's much better to be a boy.

624
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,479
Now I know I can not change.

625
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,152
It sucks being a girl.

626
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,879
How are you?

627
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,319
And you?

628
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,439
Super great.

629
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,839
Not funny.

630
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,719
Well, what?

631
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,079
You lose the time, nothing will happen.

632
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,433
Will nothing happen any more?

633
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,959
Nothing will happen any more.

634
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,798
I am not used to that
"nothing" with you.

635
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,479
It has become more important
than I wanted, but will not last.

636
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,118
Because I hate this.

637
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,475
- But it's not his fault.
- Get off me.

638
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,799
Let me go!

639
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,679
Take me in the car.
I have to tell you something.

640
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,114
- Why in the car?
- Here I do not want.

641
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,319
How can I say?

642
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,914
How can I say "I love you" without
saying 'Thomas' In the same sentence.

643
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,999
It is terrible not to be
able to separate two things.

644
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,035
But I can not.

645
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,999
I told him you had become more
important than what I wanted.

646
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,390
- You could have told me.
- He knows perfectly.

647
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,599
I also told him that I hated this.

648
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,510
And it's true.

649
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,149
I would like to be totally
with you but I can not.

650
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,675
I do not know what joins
Thomas and me, perhaps nothing

651
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:41,638
at all, but it is difficult
for me to believe it.

652
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,359
Ours cannot last, we are under
the effect of the surprise.

653
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,635
Do not precipitate anything,
everything will only stop.

654
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,394
As soon as you stop looking
at me with interest.

655
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,079
The life in trio is a dream.

656
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,640
While among several it is the reality.

657
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,552
We'll see where it ends.

658
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,711
Let each take theirs.

659
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,039
Discard the pairs by color.

660
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,156
We avoid the jack of spades.

661
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,238
The cards have spoken.

662
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,719
Good night.

663
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,159
- We swim tomorrow morning?
- 'Good idea.

664
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:47,038
- Are you awake?
- We'll see who wakes who.

665
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,588
He does not care.

666
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,799
You do not believe what
you say, and you know it.

667
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,239
He has decided to move on.

668
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:07,232
The distinction is important
but it's not fair.

669
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,159
Since it will end up
happening, thus it's ok?

670
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,628
No, do as if you did not know him.

671
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,715
You awake.

672
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,270
If this is how you see it, so it must be.

673
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,717
You need not stay.

674
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,198
I say to you that you should
go out and you go out.

675
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,713
You do not understand
anything, do not listen.

676
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,913
I do not understand what you want.

677
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,878
If you still love me.

678
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,358
What do you think of me.

679
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:11,834
I would like to know if you
have met in Paris without me.

680
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,309
Yes.

681
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,996
So you know what I think of you.

682
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,274
I hadn't thought about it before,
but now I understand.

683
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,238
I do not want you to stay.

684
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,479
I would do what he asked, if he wanted..

685
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,039
But I should feel the desire.

686
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,315
It would be an order and
I would obey at once.

687
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,278
A desire that is an order.

688
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,792
It was not me who started,
it was you who kissed me.

689
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,039
He said he knew we met in Paris.

690
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,508
But he does not know it
was you who kissed me.

691
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,518
This night I hate him.

692
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:31,068
He's just as pretentious
as those in high school.

693
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,557
He does not understand what is
between people.

694
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,074
He does not understand that he
and I are above everything.

695
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,799
So I do not want to go to class,
not for the teachers,

696
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,639
there is always some useless one
that does not support you.

697
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,029
But we have nothing to do with them.

698
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:04,072
No, it is all these
he-men, vicious and arrogant.

699
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,151
This night, though there's reason,
they seem alike and it scares me.

700
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,599
I will stop going to school,
I will study at a distance.

701
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,599
I do not want more relations
with these little men.

702
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,431
The wars they have.

703
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,279
Thomas should not let me go with them.

704
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,314
This night has a very cold look.

705
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,477
If I was kissing him, it would ice
over the whole body.

706
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,599
He has not kissed me but I am frozen.

707
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,599
It's the same.

708
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,319
It is not cold, it is an insensitivity.

709
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,436
Sometimes, emotions just leave you.

710
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,439
You end up not feeling anything.

711
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,239
Feelings, not the emotions.

712
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,839
Feelings cause emotions.

713
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,919
Yes, but it is not a nice word.

714
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,959
It was not to use 'feeling'
to kick some ass.

715
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,679
I know you do not like.

716
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,432
Sometimes I do not care.

717
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,679
Often I pushed the emotions back
of the people who wanted.

718
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,194
Or perhaps what was rejected were mine.

719
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,156
There are days in which scarcely you
support the love of the others.

720
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,119
Thomas is very afraid of the feelings.

721
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:29,317
That does not mean that he doesn't
have, but just the opposite.

722
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,359
When I lived with him and his mother,

723
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,799
I did not like him as much as now.

724
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,597
I wasn't in love with him on a daily basis.

725
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,839
There were things about him
and moments I did not like.

726
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,559
Now I like him all the time,
whatever he does.

727
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:01,039
I love him up to a point and when he
kisses me, it is the unconscious one.

728
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,319
Yes, the two you kiss, we
are in love with the same.

729
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,912
We will be forever.

730
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:12,034
Soon I will not be able to kiss
the girl that he loves.

731
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,079
Soon I will cease to have charm.

732
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,038
That's why we like being in love
with you at the same time.

733
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,559
When tomorrow we swim together
we will think about you,

734
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,039
without saying your name
even once, Juliette.

735
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,999
You're crazy!
He will not swim with you.

736
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,239
He is going to be angry.

737
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:37,038
And he and you are not equal,
are not the same thing.

738
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,873
I already I am less cold.

739
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,079
Will you come to say good night?

740
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,956
Yes.

741
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,879
We should not.

742
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,909
Yes, like any girl.

743
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,155
Later, it will end.

744
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,754
I love him.

745
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,359
Day Five: although I have
been caught, it's not for nothing ...

746
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,839
Thomas is stronger.

747
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,959
It is not a history of
sex, not against you.

748
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,159
I did not ask anything!

749
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,999
I do not want to hear anything.

750
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,433
And much less of you.

751
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,119
When we got downstairs
I thought one thing only:

752
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,473
The head breaks.

753
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,873
I have decided to shout
whenever you approach.

754
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,359
And also, every time I go near you.

755
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,590
To shout so that he hears me
and comes at once.

756
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,199
Thomas!

757
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,159
I have a covenant of eternity with Thomas.

758
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,479
Although I have fallen, it doesn't
serve for nothing, it is stronger.

759
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,913
It is stronger than you.

760
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,718
I will go first.

761
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,390
We could be street sweepers in Venice.

762
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,193
There it would be okay.

763
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,517
We would wake up on the water.

764
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,158
That is so nice.

765
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,955
Closer to home there is a couple
that lives at the entrance of a store.

766
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,559
They are boy and girl.

767
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,595
Surely they will not be separated ever.

768
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,032
Neither will we.

769
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,999
There's no obligation to
be sad post animal sex.

770
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,514
- "Post", not "prost".
- Yes.

771
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,070
- After fucking the animal rests.
- No, after fucking he is sad.

772
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,719
We will ask him about it
when we return to Paris.

773
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,951
And he will answer:
"What do you care?"

774
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,919
Let's go.

775
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,433
This is sordid.
