00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,167
[Sniffs] Well, he was a...

173
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,338
sensitive guy.

174
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:58,426
I never found that out.
He stood me up, never showed.

175
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:02,513
It was a Friday. The following night he
committed suicide with his service revolver.

176
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:06,559
I know all about that.
I found the body Monday morning.

177
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,410
I didn't know that.

178
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,104
Well, there's a lot of things
you people don't know.

179
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,398
Well, someone talked him
out of showing up here.

180
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:15,776
Probably told him he'd be a wimp if he
admitted something was bothering him.

181
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,739
- What are you getting at?
- You tell me.

182
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:21,323
[Scoffs]

183
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,829
- Please don't slam the...
- [Door Slams]

184
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:55,691
- Hey, Harry.
- Oh, Officer Forrest.

185
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,318
- How you doing tonight?
- It's you.

186
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:59,612
They tell me you got
your picture in the paper.

187
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,363
I guess congratulations
are in order.

188
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,705
That's not such a bad picture.

189
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,625
I'll tell you what, Harry.
I'll take a dozen of 'em.

190
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,210
A dozen it is.

191
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,879
How often do I get a celebrity
around here? [Chuckles]

192
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:25,638
Okay, Harry, give me your hand.
Okay, look, this is a five, okay?

193
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:27,223
- You trust me?
- I trust you.

194
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,268
- All right. You keep the change.
- Thank you. Thank you. All right.

195
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,024
[Blade Unsheathes]

196
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,372
Okay, let's see
what they said about Terese.

197
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,749
- [Stabs]
- [Groaning]

198
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,536
- [Gasping]
- Jack! What's going on?

199
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,213
What's happening? Jack.

200
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:02,049
Talk to me. Talk to me.

201
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:04,718
Police! Police! Police!

202
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,475
Strangled like the rest.

203
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,394
All strippers.

204
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,938
Sure picks the pretty ones.

205
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,357
Lovejoy, you look sick.

206
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,517
Well, I hate being around
stiffs ever since

207
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,070
they made me kiss my
grandmother at the funeral.

208
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:28,576
Remove the sheet.

209
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,286
Could you do it, please?

210
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,837
[Sobs]

211
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:42,798
[Groans]

212
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:50,639
[Sobbing]

213
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,607
Do you have any idea what the family
wants done with the body?

214
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,985
I'll call his mother in Florida.

215
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,904
[Sniffling]

216
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:10,075
Teresa, can you think of anyone
with a motive to kill Jack?

217
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:16,749
You were at the lounge
in headquarters.

218
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:20,544
You had an argument. You got angry.
You walked out. Where did you go?

219
00:20:20,628 --> 00:20:23,172
[Sniffles]
Home.

220
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,383
You didn't wait outside the building
and try to make up with him?

221
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:29,345
I'd have no reason to kill him.
I loved him.

222
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,263
Well, maybe you loved him
too much. Huh?

223
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:34,266
Maybe you... maybe he thought
you were crackin' up.

224
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,936
He didn't wanna marry you
and you got angry.

225
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,188
[Sniffles]
This is bullshit!

226
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:43,192
Why don't you ask Commissioner Doyle
who killed Jack?

227
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,110
Look, I'm just
following procedure.

228
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:46,987
You know as well as I,
nine out of 10 times...

229
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:49,949
the prime suspects
are usually family, relatives or friends.

230
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:53,786
- That's where you find the killer.
- You bastards.

231
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:00,918
<i>[Teresa] Why don't you ask
Commissioner Doyle who killed Jack?</i>

232
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:03,295
I don't like what you're asking me
to do to Officer Mallory.

233
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:04,880
<i>You know as well as...</i>

234
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,414
We're just doing it for
the good of the department.

235
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:08,801
We don't even consider her a suspect.

236
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:11,845
It's just our way of putting her
on the defensive for a while,

237
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:15,474
keep her under control
so she doesn't go to the papers.

238
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:19,311
My time would be better spent
finding out who killed Jack.

239
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:24,066
Your time, Detective,
is to put more pressure on her!

240
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,777
That's a direct order.

241
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:31,782
[Door Opens, Closes]

242
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:35,119
Damn it.

243
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:38,414
- I don't like it either.
- You should talk.

244
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,375
Your report described her
as mentally unsound and unfit for duty.

245
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,461
How am I supposed to really judge her?
She's out there on the streets being a cop.

246
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:47,172
I sit behind my desk
like a social worker.

247
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:50,050
I just don't like people who try
and get inside other people's heads.

248
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,220
Yeah, you made that very clear to me
in my office yesterday.

249
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:55,764
Is there
any particular reason?

250
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:01,020
My wife was under the care
of a psychiatrist for over a year.

251
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,856
You know, standard problems, cop's wife.

252
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:06,358
Oh, I admit
I'm not the easiest guy to live with.

253
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:09,278
But she couldn't make a move without him.

254
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,114
Stopped communicating with me, only him.

255
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:15,367
Now she's my ex-wife.

256
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:17,453
Is that reason enough for you?

257
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:21,373
I'm sure the doctor was just doing
what he thought was best.

258

[Sighs]

259
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:27,463
I don't buy into this psychology stuff.
I think you're all full of shit.

260
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,507
So you can take your Carl Jung and
Sigmund Freud and shove 'em up your ass.

[Sighs]

262
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,179
And just to clear up matters...

263
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:41,393
I talked Joe Minelli into canceling
that appointment with you,

264
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:43,771
and I don't feel guilty about it.

265
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:46,106
How could you feel guilty?

266
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,109
- You're a cop.
- So are you.

Hey, stop! Don't do it!

Oh, for God sakes,
you already did it!

270
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:01,997
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on.
Can't we talk about this?

271
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,125
I'll move the car.
I was just coming back to move the car.

272
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,628
- I got here first.
- Yeah, but I'm here. I'm right here.

273
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:11,048
- You can't tow me away.
- Read the back of your summons.

274
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:15,803
Hey, look, you're all alone. Can't we work
this out, just between you and me, huh?

275
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:18,013
- What? You're offering me a bribe?
- Not at all.

276
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:21,266
But if you tow my car,
I won't be able to get to work tomorrow.

277
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,144
- I'll lose a whole day.
- You can afford it.

278
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,563
You enjoy this.
You son of a bitch.

279
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:29,025
You got a shitty
nothing civil service job...

280
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,567
Oh, careful of my fender with that.

281
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:33,654
This is a new paint job.
I just had the whole thing waxed.

282
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:36,031
You'll be towing fucking cars
the rest of your life. You know that?

283
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,534
You'll never be anything.
You can't even do this stupid job right.

284
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,912
I'd like to see
the piece of shit you drive.

285
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,208
You better start thinking
about getting out to Brooklyn

286
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:50,087
early tomorrow to reclaim this beauty.

287
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,132
A lot of cars
get stripped in our lot.

288
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:56,885
Stereo, the tires,
the whole engine.

289
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:00,430
That's why I wouldn't own
a car in this town.

- Here you go, Harry. Good night.
- Excuse me.

Hi. I'd like to talk to you.

299
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,890
Do I know you?

300
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:45,225
I'm from the police department.

301
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:47,477
I talked to the cops
already enough.

302
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:50,105
I'm not an investigator like the others.
I'm a psychologist.

303
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,409
I'm trying to do a profile on this killer.

304
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:53,400
I've got nothing to say.

305
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:55,444
I'm trying to make a living.

306
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,197
Maybe you could tell from his footsteps
is he a large man...

307
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,365
or perhaps he said something.

308
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:01,950
No footsteps.

309
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,913
I just heard Jack screaming and...
That's all.

310
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:09,291
Did you touch him?
Not the victim, the killer.

311
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,001
Why did you ask me that?

312
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:14,504
You did, didn't you? Tell me.

313
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,885
I lost my sight in combat in Sicily.

314
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:22,304
A German grenade
went off in my face.

315
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,974
Killed all the others
in the foxhole around me.

316
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,311
I lay there more than a day,

317
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,272
surrounded by these dead bodies,

318
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,524
buried in them.

319
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,985
At night, they froze.

320
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,368
Them being on top of me
kept me from freezing too.

321

I'd feel anything like that again.

324

Just for a second, mind you,
and I was back there again...

325
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,890
with the dead.

326
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:14,773
- Ow!
- You killed him, you son of a bitch!

327
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,068
Ow! Take it easy! Look, if he
wanted to tow my car, so what?

over bullshit like that!

I'm talking about a man
who killed your predecessor.

339
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:00,402
A man who may try to pull
the same number on you.

340
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:04,072
Then the wrong guy
died in that truck in the river?

341
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:08,160
When this leaks out, people are not gonna
want to pick up the phone and dial 911.

342
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:10,996
They're gonna want
to defend themselves.

343
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,665
We're looking at a bloodbath here.

344
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:16,168
Citizens blowing each other away
like there isn't any law.

345
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,587
Tell me the truth.
Do you think it's a cop?

346
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,173
Some officer
that's gone off the deep end?

347
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:24,134
Doesn't fit the description
of any cop I know.

348
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:26,636
Six three feet,
scars all over him.

349
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:28,722
Except one.

350
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:32,601
[Doyle]
Don't say it.

351
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:35,604
Don't even think it.

352
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,776
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

353
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:44,196
We've got
to get this killer.

354
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:47,366
Better assemble a new task force.

355
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:50,911
- Get some aid from the governor.
- Well, I got a lead.

356
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:53,413
This policewoman, Teresa Mallory.

357
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,374
Mallory?

358
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:58,627
Oh, my God. Not her again.

359
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,337
Yeah, her.

360
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,672
Killed the boyfriend.
I figure he's gonna go after her.

361
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,131
I don't get it.

362
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:07,159
He's had a lot of opportunities to kill her.
Why hasn't he killed her?

363
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:10,972
Maybe he enjoys making her afraid.

364
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:20,774
I'm beginning to think
maybe you're not so crazy.

365
00:28:20,857 --> 00:28:24,194
Great. Then you'll be out of a job too.

366
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:29,157
They've asked me to certify you unfit,
but I can't do it.

367
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,122
I read all about Cordell
and what happened to him.

368
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:37,991
Look, if you want more
information, just tune in to

369
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,543
<i>Criminals at Large</i>
television show tonight.

370
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:42,087
- Why would you go on that show?
- Why not?

371
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,423
They alert the public to wanted criminals.

372
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,592
A half dozen or so have been caught
or turned in as a direct result.

373
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:49,553
And who's gonna believe you,
the lunatic fringe?

374
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:52,472
- Will you come with me?
- I can't.

375
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,893
- What are you gonna say?
- [Horn Honking]

376
00:28:56,977 --> 00:28:58,562
There's my cab.

377
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:02,983
[Sighs] All right, I'll go with you.

378
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,402
I'll even pay for the cab.

379
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:10,657
Oh, where to, girls?

380
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,409
Mayflower Hotel.

381
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:14,077
Sounds good to me.

382
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,344
I just jumped out
to get a pack of smokes.

383
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,555
I hope you girls
weren't waiting in the cold too long.

384
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,140
No, it's okay.

385
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:38,101
When I saw the bag, I said,
“This is a run to the airport.”

386
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:40,770
[Chuckles] Guess
you can't win 'em all.

387
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:42,772
I don't see anyone following us, Teresa.

388
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:45,484
Some ex-boyfriend
giving you a hard time?

389
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,527
Yeah, sort of.

390
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,070
The shows are gonna
be letting out now.

391
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,949
Um, maybe I can beat the
crosstown traffic if I cut down this way.

392
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,118
No, no!
Stay on the busy streets.

393
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:56,745
Hey, what's going on here?

394
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,080
You ever seen one of these?

395
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:02,959
Yeah, I seen plenty of them.

396
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:05,212
And it usually means
I ain't gettin' a tip.

397
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:08,507
- [Thumping]
- Damn.

398
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,675
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

399
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,887
I think one of my tires
is going flat.

400
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,597
Driver, just stay in the car.

401
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,516
- Don't get out.
- You kidding?

402
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,143
- Drive.
- On my rim?

403
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,979
Teresa, take it easy.
Anybody can get a flat tire.

404
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:25,899
Look, cop or no cop,
I own this cab.

405
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:28,235
I'm not gonna fuck it up
for anybody.

406
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,162
Holy shit.

407
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:42,165
You're making it worse than it has to be.
Nobody's following us.

408
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:44,459
Just stay in the cab.

409
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:54,469
When you left your cab
to go for cigarettes, somebody must...

410
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,888
have messed with your tires.

411
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,640
Damn kids, I'll bet.

412
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:01,893
[Tires Squeal]
- Where the hell you goin'?

413
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:04,187
Teresa, stop it.
What are you doing?

414
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:08,149
I knew it. I never should
have let cops in my cab.

415
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,828
- What's he want?
- I don't know.

416
00:31:37,554 --> 00:31:39,639
Keep down!

417
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:57,198

418
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:06,750
Shit!

419
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,647

420
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,195

is going on?

449
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,808
All right,
easy does it.

450
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,311
We'll get you out of there.

451
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,813
Radio in for a hacksaw up here!

452
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:42,191
We got to get
these cuffs off of her!

453
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:44,777
All right,
just take it easy.

454
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:46,988
We're gonna get you
out of there. Relax.

455
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:54,245
You better lie still.
Your wrist is broken.

456
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,290
Better fix me up quickly.
I gotta be on TV in a few hours.

457
00:36:57,373 --> 00:37:00,084
I'm Detective McKinney.
I'm gonna ride inside.

458
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:03,087
You okay?

459
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:07,550
I was on my way to Teresa's apartment
when the report came over the radio.

460
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:10,303
I guess you don't have to worry
about her doing any more talking.

461
00:37:10,386 --> 00:37:13,556
[Sighs] I'm not feeling
too great about all this.

462
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,351
I doubted her in the beginning too.

463
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:18,811
But I saw him.

464
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:20,897
I saw what he did.

465
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:26,027
What'd you see? Big guy in a
bulletproof vest dressed up like a cop?

466
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:30,448
Sean, I saw Matt Cordell.

467
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:35,161
[Male Host] Tonight, <i>Criminals
at Large</i> goes after a serial killer...

468
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:37,789
who's claimed the lives
of beautiful young girls...

469
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:41,834
working as exotic dancers and strippers
in New York City.

470
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:45,296
And you, the audience,
may help us to catch him.

here in the heart of Times Square.</i>

<i>But first I would like you to meet</i>

475
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,475
<i>Deputy Commissioner
Edward Doyle of the N.Y.P.D.</i>

476
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,432
<i>[Female Bartender] Do
you want another drink?</i>

477
00:37:59,456 --> 00:37:59,944
Yeah.

00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,397
<i>[Host] Just what has your
department done about this case so far?</i>

479
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,066
<i>We've contacted and alerted
young women...</i>

480
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,111
<i>who seem to be
the killer's prime target group.</i>

481
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:10,446
We have a special late guest here.

482
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,865
Actually, she's one of your lady cops.

483
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:17,328
She's also a police psychologist,
and her name is Officer Susan Riley.

484
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:19,330
- Susan, welcome to the show.
- Thank you.

485
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:23,376
Mr. Brady, the murders of these
exotic dancers is a very tragic situation.

486
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:26,796
Now, my concern is another series of
killings going on that's being covered up.

487
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:29,590
Pardon me.
Mr. Brady, this is utterly nonsense.

488
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,052
The so-called “maniac cop”
did not drown in the river, as reported.

489
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,680
Well, Commissioner, what...
what do you have to say about this?

490
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:39,183
Well, the homicides
that Officer Riley is talking about...

491
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:42,603
were deliberately set up
to imitate the earlier killings.

492
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,313
Then tell me something,
Commissioner.

493
00:38:44,397 --> 00:38:47,316
Why is this being kept
from the public and the press? Hmm?

494
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,820
The killer craves publicity.
We're denying him that.

495
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:53,865
We hope that his behavior
will become foolhardy...

496
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,200
and he'll expose himself,
show himself.

497
00:38:56,284 --> 00:38:57,952
Then we expect to nail him.

498
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,465
Mr. Commissioner, why don't
you just admit that Matt Cordell

499
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:01,789
is responsible for these killings?

500
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,207
Cordell died in prison.

501
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,544
<i>[Susan] He was brain-dead but still
breathing when his body was released.</i>

502
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:08,713
<i>He recovered and came back
to avenge himself...</i>

503
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,834
<i>upon the police department
and the city officials</i>

504
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:12,550
<i>who railroaded him
into jail in the first place.</i>

505
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,343
<i>You know how many people
have been murdered already?</i>

506
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:16,846
<i>And yet, their replacements still
insist upon hiding the facts...</i>

507
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:19,182
<i>[Brady] We're running out of time here.

01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,298
Will you hold it down?

844
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,133
Shit.

845
01:01:28,176 --> 01:01:31,471
Get more privacy when I get back
in the motherfuckin' death house.

846
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,848
Is that where you're goin', man?
Sing Sing?

847
01:01:33,932 --> 01:01:37,185
What the fuck are you,
Barbara Walters?

848
01:01:37,268 --> 01:01:39,396
Shit, man.

849
01:01:41,689 --> 01:01:43,400
Yeah.

850
01:01:43,483 --> 01:01:45,735
Motherfuckin' mornin'.

851
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:47,404
Shit.

852
01:01:47,487 --> 01:01:51,491
I stalled them motherfuckers
for five years.

853
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,034
Yeah.

854
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:55,662
The Supreme Court, it fucked me.

855
01:01:56,704 --> 01:01:59,666
And it wasn't even safe sex.

856
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,002
It's cruel and unusual punishment.

857
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,963
No bullshit.

858
01:02:05,046 --> 01:02:09,509
Listenin' to assholes like you
is worse.

859
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,761
Hey, be nice.

860
01:02:11,845 --> 01:02:16,057
When my friend comes to break
me out, I might take you with me.

861
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,851
Yeah.

862
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,270
I will hold my breath...

863
01:02:20,353 --> 01:02:23,189
and my dick.

01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,235
Oh, hi there, pretty lady.

865
01:02:28,653 --> 01:02:31,781
Boy, don't you look great
in that uniform.

866
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:34,742
You want me to
autograph your cast?

867
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:37,412
Look, I still want
to talk to you about Cordell.

868
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:54,304
If you want to know about him,
stick around here tonight.

869
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:56,639
You might learn somethin'.

870
01:02:58,057 --> 01:02:59,934
What do you mean by that?

No.

879
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:18,948
It must be visiting hours,
'cause my friend is back!

[Laughing]

881
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,286
Make sure that roadblock is set up.

- [Man Shouting]
- What's going on?

883
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:28,291
He blew away half a dozen men
downstairs on the firing range.

884
01:05:28,374 --> 01:05:31,210
I don't know how many he killed upstairs.
We just got the hell out of his way.

885
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,004
That's a good strategy.

886
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:35,506
He's got Susan Riley as a hostage
on the cell block.

887
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,592
- Is she all right?
- I don't know.

888
01:05:37,675 --> 01:05:38,934
What are we doin' about this?

889
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:41,220
I got the tactical squad on its
way, and a couple of SWAT teams.

890
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,681
Doyle's been notified. He's on
his way over here to take charge.

891
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:47,018
- Take charge? That's a joke.
- You got any ideas?

892
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:50,355
If he comes out, don't interfere
with him. Just follow him.

893
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:52,065
He had a reason for coming here.

894
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,775
He's got a reason
for everything he does.

895
01:05:53,858 --> 01:05:57,654
Ooh, what'd you do to these cops?
Oh, I'd have loved to seen it.

896
01:05:57,737 --> 01:06:00,740
See, Blum?
I told you, treat me nice.

897
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,533
[Susan]
He's gonna get us killed.

898
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,839
Hey, lady, close your eyes.
You may see something you like.

899

[Chuckling]

900
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,928
Going home.

901
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:26,849
How come he don't talk?
It's weird.

902
01:06:28,476 --> 01:06:29,394
Weird!

903
01:06:29,477 --> 01:06:32,855
He just handed me
your transfer papers to Sing Sing.

904
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:34,524
I ain't goin' back there.

905
01:06:34,607 --> 01:06:36,651
Well, I think that's
what he's got in mind.

906
01:06:36,734 --> 01:06:38,778
Hey, man, they gonna kill me!

907
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:43,074
No, he wouldn't let that happen
to a pleasing personality like yourself.

908
01:06:43,157 --> 01:06:45,326
You've been in Sing Sing before.
What's back there for you?

909
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,913
Come on. You're a bright girl.
Haven't you got that figured out yet?

910
01:06:48,996 --> 01:06:50,707
We're goin' there...

911
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:53,376
to break out all them guys
on death row.

912
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:55,169
There's about 20 of 'em
up there on appeal.

913
01:06:55,253 --> 01:06:57,046
Real lovable types.

914
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:59,257
Yes, that's...
That's what we're gonna do.

915
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,593
'Cause we're recruitin' an army.
Aren't we?

916
01:07:03,636 --> 01:07:04,971
Sure.

917
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:08,433
See, 'cause it's, like,
your thoughts are in my mind.

918
01:07:08,516 --> 01:07:10,476
I got you figured out, man.

No, we're gettin' stronger.

Yeah!
[Chuckles]

921
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:15,398
'Cause we got ourselves a leader.

01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:18,401
Oh, I don't want no part of this.
I'm not goin' to no state pen...

We gonna bring her along?

926
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:29,036
All right, sweetheart.
Here's a jacket.

927
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,634
You lead the way.

928
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:33,708

be the first to know about it.

[Cackles]

930
01:07:43,551 --> 01:07:48,514
Terrific. She puts on a uniform and
immediately gets taken hostage. Some cop.

931
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,686
- Why is he going back there?
- Shut up and get in.

I'm bad! Whoo!

944
01:09:21,065 --> 01:09:23,818
[Cackling]
That's right, eh, Blum?

945
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:27,822
Don't change your shorts, baby,
'cause this ride's just startin'.

946
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,831
Do-si-do!

Yeah!

949
01:10:02,315 --> 01:10:04,358
What do you think
of that, little lady?

950
01:10:04,442 --> 01:10:06,360
Huh?

951
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:13,200
Going in the wrong direction.
That's the parkway up ahead.

952
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:16,412
Same route Cordell took.
I think I know where he's going.

953
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:17,955
How do you know that?

954
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:22,084
One of the escapees was scheduled for
a transfer to the death house at Sing Sing.

955
01:10:22,168 --> 01:10:24,962
Cordell's making the delivery.
He's homesick.

956
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:27,089
How come you didn't
say anything about that before?

957
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:30,301
'Cause all the cops in the world
can't stop Cordell.

Only you can.

01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:33,888

I'm getting out.

- That's an order.
- You lost the right to make orders.

- You're going with me.
- No. No, I'm not going anywhere.

962

What's the matter, Commissioner?
You finally believe in ghosts?

963
01:10:42,188 --> 01:10:43,856
You oughta.
You made him one.

964
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,859
Turn this goddamn car around.

965
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:50,738
[Chuckles]
That's a dumb fuckin' thing to do.

966
01:10:50,821 --> 01:10:52,615
Well, what do you
want me to do, huh?

967
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:54,659
Shove the gun in my own mouth?
Pull the trigger?

968
01:10:54,742 --> 01:10:56,327
That's too easy.

969
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:58,329
I want you to reopen
the Cordell case.

970
01:10:58,412 --> 01:11:02,124
Get some judge to set aside his conviction,
and then dig up his empty coffin.

971
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:03,793
- That's right. It's gonna be empty.
- Come on.

972
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:06,135
Then I want you to bury it
again with a police honor guard.

973
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:06,796
You're fuckin' crazy, you know that.

974
01:11:06,879 --> 01:11:10,174
Cordell got too close to you people
at city hall who were takin' payoffs.

975
01:11:10,257 --> 01:11:13,135
So you framed him, put him in
a fuckin' rathole and set him up.

976
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:15,638
- You murdered him.
- You're pushin' me too far, McKinney.

- Pull over!

I'm responsible.

981
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:33,155
What am I supposed to do now?

982
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:36,701
- Sign a confession.
- I can't do that. I'd be through.

983
01:11:36,784 --> 01:11:41,539
Well, you're through now. You're not gonna
see retirement. He's gonna come after you.

Deputy Commissioner Doyle wants
to speak to His Honor the mayor.

01:12:38,846 --> 01:12:41,932
It concerns the massacre
at headquarters.

993
01:13:15,049 --> 01:13:16,550

We weren't expecting
this guy till morning.

I got a tip his friends might try
to create a little detour, you know.

We're just playin' it safe.

that he'd been broken out of jail.</i>
