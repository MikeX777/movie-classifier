00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:14,040
This film contains some strong language. 

2
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,840
I haven't unpacked, so you can easily have that one if you want to. 

3
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,200
I just stayed there last night. 

4
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,640
I don't mind. 

5
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,720
Well, choose. 

6
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,320
Honestly, I really don't mind. 

7
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,360
It's your trip. 

8
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
I don't mind. I'll tell you what... 

9
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
Oh, come on. Just choose... 

10
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
- You stay in there. 
- Stop being so nice! 

11
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,840
It's fine, it's fine. I'll, erm... 

12
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,200
- Really? 
- Yeah. 

13
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,600
- Sure? 
- Yeah. 

14
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,760
OK. 

15
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
Will you be all right up there? 

16
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
Yeah. 

17
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,920
Baked apples. 

18
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,280
With the blackberries? 

19
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,480
Yeah. Mmm. 

20
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,240
I think that's a very good idea. 

21
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,920
OK. 

22
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,520
Oh, I love it when you do that. 

23
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,360
I think the... 

24
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,920
Sorry, darling. Can I just turn the oven on over here? 

25
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,760
There we are. Whoa! 

26
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,360
Not sure which one. Oh, it's this one, I think. 

27
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm just going to look after my eggs. 

28
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,520
Yeah, sorry. 

29
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,160
Remember, I used to do this when you were really small? 

30
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,680
Yeah. 

31
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,680
Mum, here's your hot water bottle. 

32
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,720
Thank you. 

33
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
There you go. 

34
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,120
Turning this one out. 

35
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
- Right. 
- OK. 

36
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,720
Night, my darlings. 

37
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,880
Night, night. Go up, Mum. 

38
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,720
Let's hope Dad's here tomorrow. 

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,080
You won't be seeing him again then, or... 

40
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
No, I will, I will. 

41
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll see him that night, that one night I've got before I go. 

42
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,840
Night, C. 

43
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,160
Night, night. 

44
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,320
Sleep well. 

45
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
And you. 

46
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,840
Mum? 

47
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,880
Darling? 

48
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,680
Night-night. 

49
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,760
Sleep well. 

50
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,120
You too. 

51
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
See you in the morning. 

52
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,240
Yeah. 

53
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,280
Must be quite a nice job, really. 

54
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,240
Coming away, family, free holiday. 

55
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,560
Nice bit of cooking. 

56
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
It's not very exacting. 

57
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,640
- Is everything all right? 
- Yes, delicious. 

58
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,440
Can I get you anything else? 

59
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,480
I think we're fine. Thank you. 

60
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,520
Good. 

61
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,760
Yeah. 

62
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,440
Have you come a long way, Rose? 

63
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,800
Erm, no. Well, sort of, Northamptonshire. 

64
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,320
Oh, that's quite far. 

65
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,160
Yeah, it's not Scotland, though. 

66
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
No. 

67
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
Yeah. 

68
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
Whereabouts in Northamptonshire? 

69
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
Erm, sort of, quite near Silverstone. 

70
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
That is quite far. That's almost up to Cambridge, isn't it? 

71
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Sort of on the way. 

72
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
On the way, yeah. 

73
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I'd say Cambridge is probably an hour or so. 

74
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,760
So did you have to leave very early in the morning? 

75
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,560
Erm, yeah, quite early. 

76
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
But it's fine. It's all part of the job. 

77
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,320
You're astonishingly ready for us. 

78
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm amazed that you've managed to get things together 

79
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,960
in such a short space of time. 

80
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,760
It's really great, thank you. 

81
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Well, it's a pleasure. It's what I'm here for. 

82
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,680
Mmm. 

83
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
It's a lovely house. 

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,560
- Yes. 
- Isn't it? 
- We love it. 

85
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,080
It's really, really nice. 

86
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,800
Have you stayed here before, or...? 

87
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
Oh, yes. For many years. 

88
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,640
Yeah, we've been here... Yeah. 

89
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,880
OK. 

90
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,480
Cynthia and I were here as children. 

91
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
Yeah, it's lovely. 

92
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
Lots of lovely memories. 

93
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,520
Did there used to be a picture on that wall, or..? 

94
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
Yes, how clever of you! 

95
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,520
I've just noticed the colour difference in the... 

96
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,240
Yes, it was rather horrible. 

97
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,360
Oh, right. 

98
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,120
And Cynthia and Edward very kindly took it down. 

99
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,760
Yep. 

100
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, I see. Right. Well, I'd better get back, but it won't be long. 

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,120
Great. 

102
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,760
Great, well, whenever you're ready. 

103
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,120
OK. 

104
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,040
- Thank you. 
- Thanks. 

105
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,720
- Do you want to finish that for me? 
- Mmm. 

106
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
You don't have to act so kind. You don't have to... 

107
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
What? 

108
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm just... 

109
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
She's used to it. She can just go in there. 

110
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,560
That's what she does all the time. 

111
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,600
Darling, I don't think we need to whisper. 

112
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
Oh, right, yeah. 

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,280
I'm a bit stiff from that walking. 

114
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,240
Yes. It's good. 

115
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,760
It's not a gap year, C. 

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,880
Mmm. 

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,320
I really want you to understand that. 

118
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,440
No, I'm... It sounds great. 

119
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
I mean, of course, it's wonderful, what you're doing, it's really great. 

120
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,840
Just... 

121
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,920
Perhaps you could have done it a few years ago, 

122
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,960
and you wouldn't be quite so out of step with your generation. 

123
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,680
Cynthia, he's doing it now. 

124
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,120
And then you could just get on with getting a job 

125
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
and working like the rest of us. 

126
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,200
He's had a job. 

127
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,480
But I'm happy for you. 

128
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,520
You know, that you can be so cavalier with your future. 

129
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,240
It's a luxury. I think you're doing... 

130
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,560
Taking a wonderful, excellent choice. 

131
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,080
Well, in Edward's defence, I'd have to say... 

132
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,000
I just think, perhaps a little bit more awareness that it is a luxury, 

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,040
rather than... 

134
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
It's not a luxury, and it's anything but cavalier. 

135
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,120
..a natural thing to do. 

136
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,720
CLUNKING > 

137
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,040
Abstraction is a reductive process, a way of simplifying. 

138
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,400
Mmm. 

139
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Distilling, really. 

140
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,880
So, there's no such thing as, really, abstraction, if you like. 

141
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,320
There's no such thing as reality, so abstraction is a way of simplifying 

142
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,600
and distilling the important information, so you get it home. 

143
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,320
You know, you get your intention clear across to the viewer. 

144
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,240
Well, actually, most people just want to paint the view, 

145
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,040
which is a starting point, but that's the way I started. 

146
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,160
As you get older, I suppose, you want to say something with it, 

147
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,400
so, it's a bit of, sort of a strange thing. 

148
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm teaching very specific-focused things to do, 

149
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,200
and yet I'm also introducing the idea of chaos, as well. 

150
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,800
And that's part of this kind of wonderful, well, journey. 

151
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,440
Like a two-horse race, galloping off into no-man's land. 

152
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,960
With these two horses, I suppose. 

153
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,120
And one sometimes gets in front of the other, 

154
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,760
but the intention is the main thing. 

155
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,560
What do I want to do? 

156
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,120
But you need the tools. 

157
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,480
I mean, I'm giving your mum, trying to give her as many tools 

158
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,080
in which to work with as she possibly can. 

159
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,200
Mmm. 

160
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
So... 

161
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
So, did we do anything else? 

162
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
Is it light all night, all day? 

163
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,520
Yeah, yeah. A couple of hours it's not, and it just goes a bit duller. 

164
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,680
Can you sleep? 

165
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,080
I slept out on the ice. 

166
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,520
- Did you? 
- Yeah. 

167
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,600
Goodness me. 

168
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,520
In a sleeping bag, which was fantastic. 

169
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,560
I woke up with all this prism of colours 

170
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,360
bouncing off all the icebergs. 

171
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
- It was just amazing. 
- Oh, wow. 

172
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,640
I just thought I wanted to, kind of, you know, a bit like you, 

173
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,760
just go somewhere which was, erm... 

174
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,560
And do something that I'd never, ever do again. 

175
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,440
- Yes, yes. 
- Or might not do again. 

176
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,360
- A real adventure. 
- Yeah. 

177
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,400
I've got two older sisters. 

178
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,800
Yeah. 

179
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,920
Three girls. 

180
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,400
And you're the youngest. 

181
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,960
I am. 

182
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,680
Yeah. 

183
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,040
Me too. 

184
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,160
Yeah, it's tough. It's tough at the bottom. 

185
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,280
Yeah, no, they, because they always used to wind me up so much 

186
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,000
when I was younger, because they're actually closer in age, 

187
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,120
and then there's a sort of gap between me and Chloe, so it's... 

188
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,240
Chloe? 

189
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,440
Yeah. 

190
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,760
My girlfriend's called Chloe. 

191
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,080
Oh, right. It's a lovely name. 

192
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,480
Yeah, so they all used to, you know, wind me up... 

193
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,000
..and I just fell for it, every time. 

194
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,240
But, yeah, so, lots of cooking. 

195
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,440
To come. 

196
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,320
- For them? 
- For them. 

197
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,040
I'll get some gruel. 

198
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,160
And your mum and dad? 

199
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,520
Erm... 

200
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,760
My, erm, my dad died last year. 

201
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
So, erm, yes, it's just my mum. 

202
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
So it's actually four girls. 

203
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,520
I'm so sorry. 

204
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,960
Yeah, no, no, it's fine. 

205
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,360
- Hi. 
- Hi, would you... 

206
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,760
- Morning. 
- Morning. 

207
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
Are you ready for breakfast? 

208
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,280
I'll be up and down, so don't worry, thank you. 

209
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,520
- OK. 
- You're not dressed. 

210
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,080
It'll only take... 

211
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,400
Mum didn't sleep well at all. She feels dreadful. 

212
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,000
She's wondering about the picnic. 

213
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
I can't bear it. 

214
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,600
Rose? 

215
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,760
Yeah? 

216
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,360
I know we talked about soup and other things, 

217
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,120
but could we just try and keep the picnic as small as possible? 

218
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,400
So, simple, just one basket. 

219
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,000
Sure. 

220
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,600
I think if there's less faff and carrying stuff, 

221
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,800
she might be persuaded. 

222
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,880
Mmm. 

223
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, can you go up, Edward? 

224
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,040
Yeah. 

225
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,080
Thank you. 

226
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,880
Rose. 

227
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,040
Yeah? 

228
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,680
Did you find both rugs? 

229
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,280
Erm, no, I've only found one. 

230
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,800
The cream one, I couldn't find it. 

231
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,680
There's a check one. Oh, right, OK. I'll come and have a look. 

232
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,080
Sorry. 

233
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,320
It's all right. 

234
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,520
Mum, you nearly ready? 

235
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,080
Hello. 

236
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
Hi. 

237
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,280
How are you? 

238
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,640
Good. 

239
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,200
You ready? 

240
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
Hi, Christopher. 

241
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,960
Just get my boots on. 

242
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,240
Hi. 

243
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,360
Hi, Cynthia. 

244
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,480
Sorry, yeah. 

245
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,760
- Hi. 
- Good day for it, isn't it? 

246
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,400
Do you need a hand with anything? 

247
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
No, I think we're all right. 

248
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,200
Ready to go. 

249
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
I think that's it. 

250
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,720
Here, Edward. Torch. 

251
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,120
Great, thanks. 

252
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,720
So that's all ready. 

253
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,960
Yep, think so. 

254
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,800
Mum! 

255
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,040
So, what have we got? 

256
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,480
Just basics, you know. Sandwiches, crisps, dips. 

257
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,640
Caviar? 

258
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Yeah, champagne! 

259
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,480
She's brushing her teeth. 

260
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,160
Ah! 

261
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,520
Hello. 

262
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,840
All right? 

263
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes. 

264
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,680
Right, let's go. 

265
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,240
On the road. 

266
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,320
I'll grab that. 

267
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,400
Morning. 

268
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,440
Hi. 

269
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,480
All right? 

270
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,720
After you. Thank you. 

271
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,760
You look lovely in that. 

272
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,560
I'm worried I've forgotten something. 

273
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,880
Let me take that. 

274
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,360
Well, if we have... 

275
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,440
You've done all the work. It's fine. 

276
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,360
Yeah, as long as you've got the wine. 

277
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,240
Yeah, but, you know, I get the blame if something goes wrong! 

278
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,840
Joking. It'll be fine. 

279
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
Look after that lunch! 

280
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,120
Ow! 

281
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,400
Ow! Wait, Edward, wait. 

282
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,640
Wait, I'm hurt. 

283
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,400
Can you give me a hand? 

284
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,720
I think I've pulled a muscle. 

285
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,560
Ow! 

286
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,960
Oh. 

287
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah. 

288
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
Ah! 

289
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,960
Right, I can't go any further. 

290
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,840
She's in the same office as me. 

291
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,920
She'll carry on working for a couple of years, 

292
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,200
and then settle down and have babies. 

293
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,040
It's all rather perfect. 

294
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,160
It depends. Some jobs are very... 

295
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,760
Do you remember, Christopher? 

296
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,800
You go to the left. 

297
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,080
To the left? 

298
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,520
Yeah, just follow this... 

299
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,560
It is, isn't it? 

300
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,600
This path? 

301
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,840
Yeah, that'll take us there. 

302
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,880
Come on. 

303
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,280
It looks like it's clearing up. 

304
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,360
Yeah. 

305
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,200
No wind, I suppose. 

306
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,480
Mmm. 

307
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,760
I never really was very good at that. 

308
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,880
Spotting patterns in figures and things. 

309
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,040
No. It's a shame, just having been given the opportunity. 

310
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
It was all pretty set up. 

311
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,320
There's an awful lot you can't do when you're doing that kind of work. 

312
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,680
Not exactly nourishing. 

313
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,240
Pity he couldn't stick at it just for a bit longer. 

314
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,360
Must be a bit embarrassing for Dad. 

315
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,680
You don't have to be embarrassed for your dad! 

316
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,400
It's not going to reflect on him. 

317
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Anyone else? 

318
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,680
Edward? 

319
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,960
- No, thank you. 
- I'm all right, actually. 

320
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,840
You look just like Dad with that on. 

321
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,400
You do! How weird. 

322
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,560
Have I got it on the wrong way round? 

323
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,000
No, it's the right way round. 

324
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,800
That's how I wear it. 

325
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,640
"I'll bally go and shoot those pheasants!" 

326
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,600
"Pull!" 

327
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,760
Fuck! 

328
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,960
There's a kind of Western fatigue about AIDS, I think, 

329
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,080
and...but it's still huge there. 

330
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,800
You know, ever since the '80s, the mid-'80s, when people 

331
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,040
understood what a big deal it was, I think now, in Africa, it's as 

332
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,240
big a deal as it ever was, but we've got a bit tired of hearing about it. 

333
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,520
And it's killing people all the time. 

334
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,680
You don't think it's a lost cause? 

335
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,480
No, of course it's not a lost cause. 

336
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,240
And you think you're going to make a difference? 

337
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,200
Yeah. 

338
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,400
If I can stop one person, one 13-year-old, 

339
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,520
if I can connect with just one person, 

340
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,280
and he understands what I'm talking about and protects himself 

341
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,040
against, you know, using safe sex, then I'll have done my job. 

342
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,560
I can't, I'm not the President of the UN, 

343
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,320
there's no policy-making, but at least I hope 

344
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,480
I'd be connecting with people, you know, on the ground. 

345
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,920
How else are you supposed to do it? 

346
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Yeah. 

347
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,680
Is everybody finished? 

348
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,120
Yeah, thanks. 

349
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,520
Yeah, I think so. 

350
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,640
Can I have this apple? 

351
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,200
Of course you can. 

352
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,360
Does anyone else want this apple? 

353
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,520
OK. 

354
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,080
No more brownies? Are you sure? 

355
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,720
I might save some for tea, later. 

356
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,880
They were that good? 

357
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,440
They were that good. 

358
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,520
I think, in this sort of situation, it's best to do just quick, 

359
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,120
spontaneous work. 

360
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,480
Yeah, OK. 

361
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,520
OK, OK. 

362
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,440
Does he like you painting? Does he appreciate that aspect? 

363
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,880
I think so. 

364
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,760
I think he thinks if I like it, it's a nice thing. 

365
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah, yeah. 

366
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,560
Yeah. 

367
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,480
It's a kind of place you can go, isn't it, 

368
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,800
you can just kind of relax and forget everything. 

369
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,400
I don't think he gets the full measure of it, though, you know. 

370
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,440
I don't think... 

371
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,920
I don't think Will's very strong on imagination. He doesn't like to... 

372
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,800
..give himself up to things like this. 

373
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,840
Yeah, yeah. 

374
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,640
Well, I suppose he's got other things to think about. 

375
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,040
Do you understand that? 

376
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,680
Hello, darling. 

377
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,560
How are you? 

378
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,320
Where are you calling from? 

379
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,560
Oh. 

380
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,760
Well, we're really looking forward to it. 

381
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,160
Yes, we really are, we really are. 

382
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,760
Marvellous being here with the children. 

383
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,080
Yes, they're well, yes. Edward's full of Africa. Erm... 

384
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,440
We've done some things, we've been out, the weather's been lovely, 

385
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,280
but it would be very nice if you were here with us. 

386
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,960
HORN BLOWS IN DISTANCE 

387
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,840
I'm not going to do much blue. 

388
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,560
So, you see, if I got rid of those blues there, 

389
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,480
then the other colours become, kind of, the blues. 

390
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,680
So, they exist in relationship to all the other colours, 

391
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,720
and they take on a blueness. 

392
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,680
It's kind of what I'm trying to do. 

393
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,760
To approach it more, sort of, at a slightly more intriguing tangent. 

394
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,800
Understatement. 

395
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,280
Yeah. 

396
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,800
I quite like that blue. 

397
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,840
Mmm. 

398
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040
It's kind of joyous. 

399
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,400
HORN BLOWS 

400
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,080
Hello, Rose. 

401
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,120
Hello. 

402
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,440
Bit of a breezy afternoon. 

403
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,920
Yeah. 

404
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,440
To say the least. 

405
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,680
Yes. 

406
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,040
Right. 

407
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,360
Oh, perfect. 

408
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,880
Delivery of lobsters. 

409
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,080
Thank you so much. 

410
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,440
Great, how much do I owe you? 

411
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,160
One of each. 

412
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,440
It's 35, please. 

413
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,600
35, OK. 

414
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,080
Male and a female there for you. 

415
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,840
Oh, really? 

416
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,640
And how do you tell the difference? 

417
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,880
Let's have a look. 

418
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,760
Here we go. 

419
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,520
I've got 40 there. Do you have any change? 

420
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,680
We'll sort the change out in a minute, don't worry. 

421
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,760
OK. 

422
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,000
See, that's a female. 

423
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,720
Turn her over. 

424
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,640
See the length of the shell covering her tail? 

425
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,080
Yeah. 

426
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,400
It protects her eggs, and carries her eggs down there, and see, 

427
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,480
they hide up under the shell, there. 

428
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,360
I see. 

429
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,120
You can carry them in here. 

430
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,080
With this male, the shell comes level with the body. 

431
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,800
That's the difference. 

432
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,520
That's the male, and that's the female. 

433
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,560
How amazing. 

434
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,600
Yes, incredible. 

435
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,480
And he seems to be a lot smaller than her, as well. 

436
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,400
Well, they're the same weight. 

437
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,520
Really? 

438
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,000
Slightly different shape. She looks bigger because... 

439
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,120
She looks wider. 

440
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,760
Well, it's slightly different shape, 

441
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,720
- because her shell is much bigger, you see, for carrying the eggs. 
- OK. 

442
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,200
That's why. But they're about the same weight. 

443
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,720
OK. 

444
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,720
Well, by the time they're cooked, they'll be bright red. 

445
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,360
They change colour. 

446
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,480
What's that noise? 

447
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,680
It's just air being released. 

448
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,880
Have you done this before? 

449
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,800
Not very many times, to be honest. 

450
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,320
I'm not that comfortable around them. 

451
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,400
Because I don't really hate much shellfish. 

452
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,480
In fact, I don't really eat it at all. 

453
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,360
I've had quite strange reactions in the past. 

454
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,120
Did you do it at Ballymaloe? 

455
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,640
Yeah, I did. 

456
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,040
Oh, God! Oh, my God! 

457
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,080
Scaring me! 

458
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,040
Sorry. 

459
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,800
Oh, my God. 

460
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,240
Yeah, we did it at Ballymaloe, and they were much worse than this. 

461
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,480
They were, you know, 

462
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,400
if we put the lid on, they'd be thrashing the lid off, and the lid 

463
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,040
would go flying across the room, and they were very, very awake. 

464
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,560
And very aggressive. 

465
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,360
Wow. These seem so sleepy. 

466
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,920
Well, you know, they've been out of water for a long time. 

467
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,280
Right. 

468
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,800
You know, in Ireland, it was literally like out the sea, 

469
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,280
two minutes down the road, they were in our kitchen. 

470
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,600
It's the same here, but it's... 

471
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,160
Did you always cook them like that? 

472
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,400
Well, this is the way that we were taught, 

473
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,520
because there's so many different ways. 

474
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,760
I mean, you know, at Ballymaloe, they were really big on, 

475
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,800
you know, killing things in the most humane way possible, obviously. 

476
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,320
Sure. 

477
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,520
And so the way that we learnt was to put them into tepid water, 

478
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,400
you know, sort of warmish, and then, as you bring the water up to a boil, 

479
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,720
or a simmer, they will automatically fall into a coma, basically. 

480
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,120
And then they'll die peacefully. 

481
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,280
Right. 

482
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,240
Rather than, you know, putting them in a thing of boiling water. 

483
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,800
Which is like gassing them. 

484
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,200
Yeah, it's like torturing them. 

485
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,240
Yeah. 

486
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,840
Which is not, you know, not fair. 

487
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,760
And none of it's fair, really, but... 

488
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,360
It's probably not a conversation you want to have, 

489
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,520
being a vegetarian. 

490
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,200
I think it'd be nice if we asked her to join us. 

491
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,960
I can't think of anything worse than eating with another family. 

492
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,760
- OK, fine. 
- Listen, if she's at the table... 

493
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,480
- She'd probably prefer to talk to her friends. 
- Yeah, yeah. 

494
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,000
- Edward, don't you have your own friends? You don't have to make friends with the cook. 
- Fine. 

495
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,880
I don't see her talking to her friends, that's all. 

496
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,640
She's doing the washing up. 

497
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,800
Yeah, on her own. 

498
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,040
Darling, it's a job. 

499
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,480
Oh, my God. 

500
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
It's a job she's taken on for two weeks. 

501
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,400
All we have to do is ask her to join us. We've got a massive table. 

502
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,720
It wouldn't be a huge thing. 

503
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,080
Well, then, go and do it. 

504
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,040
Edward, ask her to join us. Ask her, if you like to. That's fine. 

505
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,960
- She's a sweet girl. 
- It doesn't matter. 

506
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,200
She's very sweet. 

507
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,480
OK. Rose? 

508
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,800
Yeah? 

509
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,720
I think Edward's got a bit of a crush. 

510
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,760
Do you want a hand? 

511
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,400
He is so ridiculous. Burning martyr, sort of. 

512
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,640
Poor cook. 

513
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,360
Staff. 

514
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,520
He's just got too much empathy. 

515
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,680
It's so annoying, though. It's always in such a, sort of, accusatory way. 

516
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,360
Well... 

517
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,560
"Why don't we ask cook to join us?" As though we've... No, we shan't. 

518
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,440
That's just Edward. 

519
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,280
Thank you, darling. 

520
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,440
What's just Edward? 

521
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,600
Caring about people's feelings. 

522
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,960
- Right. 
- Clearing the table. 

523
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,440
Why are you...? 

524
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,000
No, I think we're all full. 

525
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,080
OK. 

526
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,120
Yes. 

527
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,680
I could have done that. That's... 

528
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
No problem. 

529
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,320
It's actually getting quite embarrassing now. I feel sorry for her. 

530
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,920
So what do I do now? 

531
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,360
We can both do it together. 

532
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,520
You're right! 

533
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,080
Would you rather I wasn't here? 

534
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,760
He's always trying to make himself... 

535
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,480
Now he's got to sort it out there, too. 

536
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,280
This is the whole point about helping. 

537
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,000
Poor girl just wants her bloody wages. 

538
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
Job's a job. It's a very straightforward thing. 

539
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,440
Go to the pub for a drink, or something. 

540
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,640
..absolutely delicious. 

541
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,160
My dad worked in motor racing. He was a racing driver, so, yeah. 

542
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,120
That's why we've ended up there, really. 

543
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:03,200
Yeah, so I think we're still very much, erm, as a family, 

544
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,640
we're, you know... 

545
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,360
I don't know. It's like we've come out of the coma. 

546
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,960
Sure. 

547
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,800
And that can be good, and it can also be bad, 

548
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,440
because it's the realisation, you know. 

549
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,880
That he's never coming back, sort of thing, and that's the... 

550
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,160
Yeah, I mean, that's the hardest thing, really. 

551
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,120
And yeah, you don't really feel anything 

552
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,880
after it happens for a long time. 

553
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,200
Because he died in an accident, so it was all very... 

554
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,680
You know. 

555
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,720
Mmm. 

556
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,760
You know. 

557
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,760
He walked out the door one day and didn't come back. 

558
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,960
Erm, so... 

559
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,120
God, yeah. 

560
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,440
Yeah. I can't imagine. 

561
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,520
Leucospermums, pincushion proteas, that sort of thing, 

562
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,480
mixed in with pelargoniums and what have you, you know, 

563
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,600
the geraniums with the very fragrant foliage from South Africa. 

564
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,120
And what we try to do is to stop things like the Christmas trees 

565
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,760
getting involved too much. 

566
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,160
Also what you get from here 

567
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,760
is you get these wonderful views out to the sea. 

568
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,280
Tops of the trees all showing through, that sort of thing. 

569
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,200
You suddenly realise, then, that you can see the sea when you come in. 

570
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,120
So everything up here has to survive through some pretty.. 

571
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,000
- Hello! 
- Hi! 

572
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,120
..harsh conditions. 

573
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,280
But then it would naturally get that in Table Mountain. 

574
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,840
Shall we do the photo? 

575
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,880
Yeah. 

576
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,080
Come and stand here. Be Dad. 

577
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,160
Right, lovely. Ready? 

578
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,920
One, two, three. 

579
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,320
Edward, your face is in the sun. 

580
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,040
Sorry. I'm squinting? 

581
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,240
OK? 

582
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,760
There we go. 

583
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,360
..all the palm trees, date palms. 

584
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,920
So they've been there since about 1900. 

585
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,280
Right. Well, they don't mind where we sit. 

586
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,760
So, what do you think? 

587
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,960
Nice, isn't it? 

588
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,240
- You're so good at this, Cynthia. 
- Sit here? 

589
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,200
Yeah? 

590
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,840
Whatever you'd like, darling. 

591
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,200
Would you like this? This is good, isn't it, the middle? 

592
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,280
Do you want to look out the window? Let's go this one. 

593
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,280
Yeah, nice to have a view, isn't it? 

594
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,840
Are you cold? 

595
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,440
It's looking a bit bleak. 

596
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,600
All right, well, where do you want to sit? 

597
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,520
Where shall we sit? Anyone? This one is good, isn't it? Five, here. Great. 

598
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,320
Mum, why don't you go at the head, 

599
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,360
and then Christopher, I'll sit here, Rose and Edward on the other side. 

600
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,800
Is that good? 

601
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,840
Great. 

602
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,920
Or shall we be more sort of boy, girl, boy, girl? 

603
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,120
Maybe we should have Christopher at the head, yeah? 

604
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,160
That's good, isn't it? Christopher at the head. 

605
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,200
I mean, no, you at the head, Christopher, Edward there. 

606
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,080
And then we can sit here. 

607
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,320
Lovely? 

608
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,360
Mm-hmm. 

609
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,720
Excellent. 

610
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,920
Thanks. 

611
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,680
You don't look convinced, Mum. What is it? 

612
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,520
Do you want to go that one? 

613
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,640
All right, OK. Come on, let's move on to that one. 

614
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,320
We've got so much choice, we might as well get it right. 

615
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,240
So, fine. 

616
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,680
All right? 

617
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,080
OK. 

618
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,080
Now the next choice. 

619
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,960
So me here? 

620
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,040
Yeah. 

621
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,760
Thank you. 

622
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,800
There we are. 

623
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,000
Thank you very much. 

624
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,120
You're welcome. 

625
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,760
There we go. 

626
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,800
Thank you. 

627
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,520
OK, enjoy. 

628
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,560
Thank you. 

629
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,480
Bon appetit. 

630
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,400
Quite an urge to start with all the drizzling. 

631
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,080
Not yet, thank you. 

632
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,600
Pepper, Mum? 

633
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,040
Thank you, darling. 

634
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,760
This isn't done properly. 

635
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,640
It's still really pink. 

636
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,680
Really? 

637
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,480
It shouldn't be like that. 

638
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,320
No, it shouldn't be like that all. 

639
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,880
Wait for 25 minutes, and then... Look. 

640
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,160
Isn't yours bad, Mum? 

641
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,400
I think mine's fine. 

642
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,160
You don't have to say it's fine if it's not. 

643
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,200
I mean, we've paid, so we can easily send it back. 

644
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,240
It's fine. 

645
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,920
Mine's definitely not fine, at all. 

646
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,840
Well, shall we get somebody over? 

647
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,400
Yeah. Because, look. 

648
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,280
That's actually quite dangerous if you eat like that, isn't it? 

649
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, well, if you're not happy with it. 

650
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,720
There's just no point in not complaining when you're in a restaurant for the one day out. 

651
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,760
Excuse me? 

652
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,160
Is everybody else's all right? 

653
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,480
Yeah, soup's good. 

654
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,880
You OK there? 

655
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,720
Hi. No, this isn't cooked properly in the middle. 

656
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,040
Oh. 

657
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,360
Yeah. 

658
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,640
Awfully sorry about that. 

659
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,800
That's all right. 

660
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,560
Would you like me to get you a new one? 

661
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,680
I think I'll just have something else, actually. 

662
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,760
Maybe I'll just have a soup. 

663
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,680
Because that's actually quite dangerous, I think, if you eat that. 

664
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,360
- Mum, don't you want to send yours back? 
- It's fine. 

665
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,440
You don't have to say it's fine. I'm sending mine back. 

666
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,960
I've eaten some. It's fine. 

667
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,920
Fine. All right. 

668
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,600
- There we are. Thank you very much. 
- Would you...? 

669
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,880
Soup, great, yeah. 

670
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,800
Do you think I could have a word with the chef? 

671
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,240
Because that's quite dangerous. 

672
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,360
Yeah, no problem. I'll just go and get him for you. 

673
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,400
Thanks. 

674
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,000
You don't have to sit quietly, and you don't have to look at me 

675
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,480
like I'm making a massive scene, how embarrassing. 

676
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,680
It's not cooked properly, it's dangerous. 

677
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,840
It would be nice 

678
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,440
if I didn't just sit here with everyone in silence around me. 

679
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,840
Anyway. 

680
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,640
Well, I think you've done the right thing. 

681
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,480
If you're not happy, you know, 

682
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,720
you have the right as the customer, so... 

683
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,800
Thanks, Rose. 

684
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,480
Unfortunately, Mum and Edward 

685
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,560
are just allergic to any kind of complaining. 

686
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,200
Well, you don't want to be ill. 

687
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,640
No. No. 

688
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,720
Mine is delicious, so thank you very much. 

689
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,760
I'm sure you've done the right thing. 

690
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,640
Right, well, thanks for that, Edward. Not a moment too soon. 

691
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,800
I hear there's a problem with the meal. 

692
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,920
It was just that it took a rather long time coming, 

693
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,120
and then when it came, I don't have if you've seen it, 

694
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,040
but it's not cooked properly in the middle. 

695
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,200
Well, guineafowl is actually served slightly pink, slightly underdone. 

696
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,280
It's not like chicken. 

697
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,720
- I wasn't told that when I ordered it though, was I? 
- OK. 

698
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,760
And also, it's not really terribly good for you. 

699
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,520
I mean, it was cold and uncooked, almost cold in the middle. 

700
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,360
It was cold, was it, as well? Oh, dear. 

701
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Are you sure yours was all right, Mum? Because you don't want to get ill. 

702
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,680
- It's fine. 
- OK. Anyway, that's it. It doesn't matter. 

703
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,960
Can I get you something else? 

704
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,800
I've asked the waitress for a bowl of soup. 

705
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,880
- Have you? 
- Yeah. 

706
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,040
OK, well, I'll sort that out. I'm sorry about that. 

707
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,120
All right, never mind. 

708
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,320
I'll have a word with them, 

709
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,400
make sure they offer it properly next time. OK? 

710
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,480
Thanks. 

711
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,960
- Thank you. 
- Thanks. 

712
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,440
It's actually rather good. 

713
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,520
You can eat your soup, Edward. You don't need to set there being moody. 

714
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,360
Oh, God. 

715
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,040
DOOR SLAMS 

716
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,760
No, I'm fine. 

717
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,520
Where are you? I thought you'd be here by now. 

718
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Oh, hurry up! 

719
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,160
Yeah. 

720
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,120
Good, fine. Fine. 

721
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,920
Yeah. 

722
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,560
She's all right. Shall I get her? 

723
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,800
OK. Bye. 

724
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,000
Mum? 

725
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,560
Mum? 

726
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,040
It's Dad. 

727
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,680
Will? 

728
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,720
Not great. 

729
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,760
Erm... 

730
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,720
Just a bit difficult. 

731
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,000
It would be much better if you were here. 

732
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,440
SHE SOBS 

733
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,000
Well, it's not real, so... 

734
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,160
Sure. 

735
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,840
Sorry. 

736
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,880
That's all right. 

737
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,480
It's not nice. 

738
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,200
Erm... 

739
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,680
Would you like cereal or toast? 

740
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,720
You don't have to make my breakfast. 

741
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,080
I'll get, I'll get... 

742
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,320
OK. That's my job. 

743
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,560
Left hand, right hand. 

744
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,720
I can do it. 

745
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,800
What are you looking for? 

746
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,280
Er, a spoon. 

747
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,840
Big one, small one. 

748
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,360
Thanks. 

749
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,640
Did you ever play the spoons? 

750
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,640
Not on a regular basis, no. 

751
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,760
So, what's the plan today? 

752
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,800
I have no idea. 

753
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,680
I'll wait and see what I'm told to do. 

754
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,440
Doesn't sound like fun. 

755
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,080
That's how it is. 

756
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,200
KNOCK AT DOOR 

757
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,760
C? 

758
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,760
Yeah. 

759
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,960
Morning. 

760
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,640
Morning. 

761
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,680
What time is it? 

762
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,160
It's about 8:30. 

763
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,400
I thought we were supposed to be on holiday. 

764
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,160
Sleep all right? 

765
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,280
Yeah. 

766
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,640
What do you want? 

767
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,840
I've brought you a cup of tea. 

768
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh. 

769
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,840
OK. 

770
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,440
Do you want to go for a bike ride later? 

771
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,480
No. 

772
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,360
I've just woken up. 

773
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,560
You don't have to decide now. 

774
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,760
It was more of a feeling than a dream. 

775
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,680
It was about Dad. 

776
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,440
And I was... 

777
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,760
And C was there, and anyway, we were in the mountains, 

778
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,200
or something, and I was late. 

779
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,280
I was late. 

780
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,440
Weird. 

781
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,080
Where was Dad? 

782
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,840
He was waiting for me. 

783
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,760
But I was late. 

784
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,440
He was so angry. 

785
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,240
Ey-up! 

786
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,560
Ay-ay-ay! 

787
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,440
Come on, you bird! Come on! 

788
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,880
Get up! 

789
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,160
Ey-up! 

790
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,520
Get up, get up, get up! 

791
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,400
Up-up, up-up! 

792
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,080
Ay-ay! 

793
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,480
Ey-up! 

794
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,480
Good boy, good boy, get on, get on. 

795
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,880
Come on! 

796
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,680
OK? 

797
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,280
OK? 

798
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,560
Ey-up! 

799
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,600
Ay-ay! 

800
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,000
Ey-up! 

801
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,040
Good boy. 

802
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,320
Ay-ay! 

803
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,600
Ey-up! 

804
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,960
Get up! 

805
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,600
Ey-up! 

806
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,120
- Good boy. 
- Ay-ay! 

807
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,600
Get up, get up. 

808
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,760
Good boy, good boy. 

809
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,040
Ey-up! 

810
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,640
Mush, mush! 

811
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,760
Ey-up! 

812
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,240
Talking, talking! 

813
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,800
Ye-ye-ye. Ay-ay! 

814
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,440
Ay-ay!

Hello? Hi! 

828
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,640
Oh, I'll just come round. One sec. 

829
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,960
Morning. 

830
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,040
Hi. 

831
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,800
- All well? 
- Hi, I'm Rose. 

832
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,120
Pleased to meet you. Steve. 

833
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,320
I'm cooking for the family. 

834
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,080
Ideal. I brought you a brace of birds from the shoot the other day. 

835
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,000
Great. I didn't know you were coming. The family have gone for a walk. 

836
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,040
- No, I've rather sprung it on you. 
- Yes, you have! 

837
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,480
So, I've brought you a nice brace. 

838
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,400
They've been hung for three or four days, 

839
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,800
- so they're ready to pluck, really, so... 
- Wow! 

840
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,840
They'll be super. 

841
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,040
OK, so, well, you might have to give me some advice, 

842
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,560
because I've never really... 

843
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,600
Right. 

844
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,200
Actually, I've plucked a duck once, 

845
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,320
but I can imagine it's quite similar. 

846
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,440
Very similar. 

847
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,880
The good thing about these, you don't have the down on them 

848
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,600
- like a duck, so it's slightly easier to pluck. 
- OK. 

849
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,840
Basically what you do is pull the tail feathers out. 

850
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,960
Yeah. 

851
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,840
Pull the primaries out, on the wing, OK? 

852
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,920
And then, basically, from there on, you just pluck it downwards. 

853
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,160
Yeah. 

854
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,760
If you pull upwards, it tends to sort of rip the skin a wee bit, 

855
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,200
so you have to be careful of that. 

856
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,080
Pull it downwards into a sack, so sit down, outside, probably, 

857
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,600
with a sack open, and just pull all the feathers into a sack. 

858
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,960
OK. 

859
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,560
And then you'd need to take the head off, 

860
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,440
take the legs off and put it in some foil, stick it in the oven. 

861
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,800
And what about the guts and everything? 

862
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,200
The guts, basically, you draw them out from the back end. 

863
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,280
OK. 

864
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,360
Take the crop off that's inside the chest, basically, you'll find it. 

865
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,000
It's a sort of lump, there. 

866
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,040
Right. 

867
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,600
- Probably be full of corn or food they've been eating. 
- Right. 

868
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,640
Pull that out, job done. 

869
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,480
That's good. 

870
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,760
Don't forget those white shapes behind the object, Patricia. 

871
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,240
Yes. 

872
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,760
Thank you. 

873
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,040
Thank you. 

874
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,520
There may come a point in the painting where you just need 

875
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,200
to let it rest, let it dry a little bit, and then get back into it. 

876
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,720
- Mmm. 
- Thanks. 

877
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,120
Mmm. 

878
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,880
It's great to get this kind of degree of chaos. 

879
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,400
Because chaos gives ideas which you may not have found out 

880
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,760
if you'd tried to control it completely. 

881
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,880
Oh, yeah. 

882
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,960
Well, that's for ever going to be the difficult part for me. 

883
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,240
Chaos, yes. 

884
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,960
- Controlling chaos. 
- Yes. 

885
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,280
That's better. 

886
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,120
Yeah, very good. 

887
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,320
- Hi. 
- Hi. 

888
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,080
How are you doing? 

889
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,800
Good, yeah. Your family are doing very well. 

890
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,280
Well, Christopher's pleased. I think that's the main thing. 

891
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,400
Well, it probably isn't the main thing, but... 

892
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,760
DOOR OPENS 

893
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,920
Hi. 

894
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,320
- Hi. 

895
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,280
- How are you? 
- Good. 

896
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,080
OK. Bold, now. 

897
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,200
Think of the whole. 

898
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,520
So do you think it's the artist in you, in a way, 

899
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:34,680
that needs more space than you would have if you had a family? 

900
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,480
Well, I don't know. 

901
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:43,040
I mean, I think it's opportunity and your own personality, 

902
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,840
and the job that I do would possibly have made it more difficult 

903
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,840
than it might otherwise have been. 

904
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,880
Mmm. 

905
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,160
I kind of regret it, 

906
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:57,640
but there's lots of children around in my life, so it's good. 

907
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,120
That's good. 

908
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,600
Yeah. Keeps me silly. 

909
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,960
Yeah! Well, that's... 

910
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,800
You've hit on something that's very important. 

911
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,640
Yeah, yeah. 

912
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,320
Yeah. I think that's one of the benefits. 

913
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,080
They keep you young, and they keep you... 

914
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,880
A bit silly. 

915
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,960
Yeah. 

916
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,120
I'm not sure Will would agree with that, 

917
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,440
but certainly from my perspective. 

918
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,960
It is such a commitment, though, isn't it? 

919
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,160
Yeah, it is. 

920
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,000
And you've got to be sure that it is something you choose, 

921
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,960
and that you can sustain it. 

922
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,760
Well, in the end, of course, you make the decision to have them, 

923
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,680
and you have them, and you hope you're doing the right thing, 

924
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,400
but then, of course, they do become young people, 

925
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,600
and then how could you not have them? 

926
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,800
Yeah. 

927
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,760
Do you see? It, sort of, has its own imperative somewhere. 

928
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Yeah, and it's your family. 

929
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,800
Yeah. 

930
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,000
Certainly wouldn't be without them. 

931
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,080
Great. Well, it looks all, sort of, coming together. 

932
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,120
Yeah. 

933
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,720
MUFFLED CHATTER 

934
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,520
Good question. Um... 

935
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,000
So, have we got pheasant? 

936
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,160
Mmm. 

937
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,160
Yeah, local pheasant. 

938
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,160
Not shot by Dad, though. 

939
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,600
Is he a good shot? 

940
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,400
Mmm. 

941
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,520
Yeah. 

942
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,800
"Bloody good shot." 

943
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,680
"Bloody best shot of the season." 

944
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,080
"Urrr!" 

945
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,680
Have you eaten yours? 

946
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,640
- Or it's sunk? 
- It's sunk, yeah. 

947
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,160
Mine's sunk, as well. 

948
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,960
Good. We're practically brothers. 

949
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,160
OK, lunch is ready, if you want to come through. > 

950
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,600
Great. 

951
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,680
OK. 

952
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,720
OK. 

953
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,040
Can you manage? 

954
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,800
There was this one instance she described of a man 

955
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,360
they called the Night Dancer, and he went round people's huts 

956
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,960
and homes, in the middle of the night, completely naked, 

957
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,720
and danced outside the front door, by the window, 

958
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,000
and would practise witchcraft on their children. 

959
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,120
And they found out who this man was, and in the light of the next day 

960
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:02,920
they pulled him into the middle of the central square and beat him. 

961
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,160
And beat him to death. 

962
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,680
Eventually, and as a volunteer, 

963
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:16,440
you can't impose any Westernised model of morality. 

964
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,880
You simply have to stand by and watch, 

965
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:26,400
because if you interfere, they will include you in his sentence. 

966
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:32,520
And it sounds absolutely horrifying. 

967
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,560
Yeah. 

968
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:40,400
What about Chloe? She must be quite worried about you going away, then. 

969
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,080
I think she is, yeah. 

970
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,240
Erm, I don't know... 

971
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,480
Is she going to visit? 

972
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,800
- No, she's not allowed to come and visit. 
- Why is that? 

973
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,080
Something to do with respect. 

974
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,960
If you're there as a Western volunteer, then you can't be seen to... 

975
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,480
You're teaching about sexual reproductive health. 

976
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:04,880
You can't be seen to then be having extra-marital sex with someone, 

977
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,000
and importing... 

978
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,400
It's a respect thing, it's something about dignity, 

979
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,560
and if you have to lead by example... 

980
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,920
I've got one, I don't know, 

981
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,680
I'm seeing her on Wednesday for one night, that's all I've got. 

982
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,120
I've got one night to see her before I go away for 11 months. 

983
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,520
I don't know what's going to happen, and... 

984
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,960
So are you going to split up? 

985
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,840
No, we're not going to split up. I don't know what we're going to do. 

986
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,240
I mean, actually, frankly, 

987
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,080
it would have been nice to have had her here, with us, now. 

988
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,880
I don't really see why she couldn't have come. 

989
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,760
She couldn't really come here, could she? 

990
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,120
Because it was like a family holiday. 

991
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,400
Well, actually, she could have come, Cynthia, 

992
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,800
and you may refer to it as a family holiday, 

993
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,800
but she actually feels like family to me, in that I'm attached to her 

994
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,160
and she's someone who's significant in my life, and she could have come. 

995
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,600
That's not really family, is it? 

996
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,800
That's just someone you're attached to, 

997
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,560
who you've been going out with for a year and a half. 

998
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,880
So you think a year and half is nothing, that, you know, 

999
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,080
I'm going away for 11 months, and a year and a half is. 

1000
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,800
Well, you obviously think so if you're going away for 11 months. 

1001
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,760
Can't be the top priority in your life, can it? 

1002
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,040
Girl's viewpoint. 

1003
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,200
I don't understand how you can say that. 

1004
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,040
I don't know what I'm doing, anyway. I have no idea what I am doing. 

1005
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,120
Am I doing the right thing? I have no idea. 

1006
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,080
I'm going away to Africa for 11 months. Why? Who knows? 

1007
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,600
Why am I qualified to teach sexual and general health? 

1008
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,520
Oh. 

1009
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,160
Oh, hell. 

1010
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,200
All right? 

1011
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,960
I've got shot in my thing. 

1012
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,120
Oh! 

1013
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,920
That really hurts. 

1014
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,240
Really, really hurts. 

1015
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,840
Darling. 

1016
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,600
So sorry, Christopher. 

1017
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,560

01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,920
I can't bear it. 

1056
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,120
Yes. 

1057
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,520
I can't bear it, William! 

1058
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,680
I really, really think I'm doing the wrong thing. 

1059
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,880
Do you? 

1060
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,920
Yeah. 

1061
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,560
Well, what's the alternatives? 

1062
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,840
Maybe I could write. I could write, maybe. 

1063
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,960
Yeah. 

1064
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,240
I write a lot. 

1065
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,440
Yeah. 

1066
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,480
Somehow. 

1067
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,840
Yeah. 

1068
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,320
It's not really what you do, 

1069
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,640
it's more the intensity by which you do it. 

1070
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,040
I mean, by the conviction of your reality that you believe in, 

1071
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,520
you'll make others believe in it. 

1072
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,360
You kind of can't make it up, really. 

1073
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,000
And then people get convinced, and even you, oneself, 

1074
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,040
gets convinced, but there's no one, kind of, hidden track, 

1075
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,920
you know, that's there, waiting for you. 

1076
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,720
It's... You've just got to step into it. 

1077
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,040
Whatever that is, and, you know, it takes, you know, 

1078
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,120
one does all sorts of things with painting. 

1079
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,360
You do all the things that are not right, 

1080
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,440
but they all contribute to the thing that will be right in the end. 

1081
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,480
It's never lost. 

1082
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,000
It's all accumulating, all building up in intensity. 

1083
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,120
But it's, it's not secure, is it? It's just not solid or anchored. 

1084
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,160
I'm just not sure. 

1085
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,560
You're quite held, aren't you? 

1086
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,600
You've got to toughen up. 

1087
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,120
DOOR SLAMS 

1088
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,240
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS 

1089
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,240
DOOR SLAMS 

1090
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,400
Ed? > 

1091
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,240
Christopher's here. > 

1092
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,960
Edward? Just came to say hello. > 

1093
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,640
All right, well... > 

1094
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,120
Would be good to meet tomorrow. > 

1095
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,360
Yeah. > 

1096
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,560
OK. Thank you so much for coming round. > 

1097
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,120
Do you want a hand? 

1098
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,920
Is it... Oh, I've cracked it, sorry. 

1099
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,560
Do you want me to put that back? 

1100
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,800
Don't put that pin in me. 

1101
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,920
All right. 

1102
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,920
Thanks. 

1103
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,720
It's almost ready. 

1104
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,720
Where are the others? 

1105
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,280
I think they're upstairs. 

1106
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,120
- Well... 
- Shall I go and... 

1107
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,360
Are you ready to eat? 

1108
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,400
Mmm, sure. 

1109
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,320
I'll go and tell them it's ready, yeah? 

1110
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,440
Yeah. 

1111
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,000
Are you going or not? 

1112
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,120
- Mmm. 
- I can do it. 

1113
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,360
No, I'll go, I'll go. 

1114
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,760
KNOCK ON DOOR 

1115
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,840
"Hello, Mummy. 

1116
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,360
"I've been a bad badger. 

1117
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,920
"I've been a bad, bad badger. 

1118
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,680
"And I'm sorry. 

1119
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,200
"Will you forgive me? 

1120
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,600
"Rrrr!" 

1121
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,520
SHE LAUGHS 

1122
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,360
"Don't worry. I'll look after you." 

1123
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,800
Rose says supper's ready. 

1124
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,160
All right, I'll come down. 

1125
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,480
You're too scared, aren't you? > 

1126
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,120
You're too scared of having to face up to your own > 

1127
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,840
than dare to look at somebody else's! > 

1128
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,280
You're so fucking selfish! > 

1129
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,640
I don't remember really going mad in London, > 

1130
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,640
bringing up children by myself. > 

1131
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,480
I am doing my best here to make sure > 

1132
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:17,240
that Edward has a wonderful trip and a wonderful send-off. > 

1133
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,720
I'm going to bed now. > 

1134
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,600
And if you don't phone Edward tomorrow to say goodbye, > 

1135
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,640
he will never forgive you either. > 

1136
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,000
And you deserve all of it! You deserve all our hatred! > 

1137
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,120
I hate you! > 

1138
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,360
(SHE HANGS UP) > 

1139
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,640
Lasagne's delicious. 

1140
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,080
Good. 

1141
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,160
All right? 

1142
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,280
Yeah. 

1143
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,840
He pulled me aside one day and said, "Christopher, I've been thinking. 

1144
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,760
"I don't think you should go to art school." 

1145
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,480
And I thought, well, what, why? 

1146
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:30,600
And he said, "I don't think you're tough enough." 

1147
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,680
Erm... 

1148
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,560
So I was completely devastated. 

1149
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,800
I was quite shy anyway, at that age, 

1150
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,480
and I just didn't know what that meant, really, 

1151
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,600
without losing my own, you know, sense of myself, 

1152
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,880
who I was, you know. 

1153
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,120
I wasn't tough, Mr, kind of, leather jacket guy. 

1154
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:55,640
I was, you know, Marks and Spencer's Hush Puppies. 

1155
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,440
But I wanted to paint. 

1156
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,720
I had something I wanted to do, I deeply wanted to do. 

1157
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,720
And I think he thought that if I went to art school, 

1158
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,280
that may be bashed out of me. 

1159
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,680
And therefore... 

1160
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,400
I should not go, 

1161
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:22,720
because that precious thing that was quite vulnerable anyway. 

1162
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,680
Well, it wasn't really vulnerable. 

1163
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,720
It was there, but it wouldn't have survived, you know, 

1164
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,000
the criticisms of others. 

1165
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,040
So... 

1166
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:37,200
I guess being tough is actually holding your course, 

1167
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,400
in some way, and... 

1168
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:45,160
Believing that thing inside of you that's really, 

1169
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,840
really important to you. 

1170
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,120
Even though it's not defined, as yet, 

1171
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:54,440
and you can't reveal it to others in its full, worldly sense. 

1172
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:13,040
But it takes a long time to... 

1173
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:19,360
In a sense, fully come to that point. 

1174
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,400
For a lot of people, it's quick. 

1175
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,840
But for me it's taken a long time. 

1176
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,160
Which I'm kind of glad, 

1177
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:28,360
because it means that I know the angles a bit more. 

1178
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:51,840
Now, if you were doing what I'm doing now, would you... 

1179
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:58,320
Would you be wanting to do, to respond to this in lots of 

1180
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:04,160
different ways at the same time, or would you stick to an idea, or a... 

1181
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,880
A theme, I suppose I mean. 

1182
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,720
Well, I guess it has a certain amount of energy, 

1183
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:15,560
so I would start with observing it in a very general sense. 

1184
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,800
Right. 

1185
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,520
Not committing to, you know, little rocks and waves, 

1186
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:27,440
but go for the overall colour sequences, really, 

1187
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:31,720
the keynotes, and then that would produce the sort of basic mood. 

1188
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,960
I mean, it's beautiful, because you've got that 

1189
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,920
sort of violety-grey clouds, and that moves into the blues and the... 

1190
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,200
And then, in opposition to that, 

1191
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:45,920
you've got a slightly orangey-violety orange, 

1192
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,360
violet coming through the orange, so there's a link there, 

1193
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:55,000
and then you've got this beautiful, sort of, Royal Doulton cup 

1194
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,520
and saucer green, you know, that sort of silvery green. 

1195
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,680
Yes, absolutely. 

1196
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:00,600
It is such a beautiful, sort of... 

1197
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,240
erm... 

1198
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:08,840
Well, it's symbolic of a place, and so... 

1199
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,880
Yeah. Yeah, it is. 

1200
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,160
That's my limit. 

1201
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,160
And when was that exhibition going to be? 

1202
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:54,400
Well, it's, I don't know. It's come from New York. 

1203
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,560
Oh, yes. 

1204
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,960
But it's early January. 

1205
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:03,840
Hi, Cynthia. Christopher's here to say goodbye. Where's Ed? 

1206
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,440
I think he's upstairs. 

1207
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,920
Edward? 

1208
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,960
Yeah? 

1209
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,520
Christopher's here to say goodbye. 

1210
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,720
Hello. 

1211
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,920
Hello, Cynthia. 

1212
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,120
- Goodbye. 
- Goodbye. 

1213
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,600
- Thank you. 
- See you soon, I hope. 

1214
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,760
Yeah. 

1215
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,360
How much longer are you here for? 

1216
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,080
Friday. 

1217
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,200
Be at my hilltop cottage. 

1218
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,240
Yeah, yeah. 

1219
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,880
Bye-bye, Ed. 

1220
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,800
This is it. Bon courage. 

1221
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,960
Thank you. 

1222
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,600
I'll write you a letter, or something. 

1223
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,800
That would be great. Bye-bye, Patricia. 

1224
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,160
- I'll see you out. 
- All right. 

1225
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,280
Have a safe journey. 

1226
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,480
- Bye. 
- Bye. 

1227
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,280
- Bye, Christopher. 
- See you. 

1228
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,960
Thank you for everything. 

1229
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,160
Keep the good work up. 

1230
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,320
Certainly will. I'll call you in a couple of weeks. 

1231
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,560
Right. 

1232
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,760
Bye. 

1233
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,680
As I can't communicate with you much, 

1234
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,400
I'm going to write little notes and put them in a little book. 

1235
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,560
And then send it to me? 

1236
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,840
Well, I was thinking of keeping it until you got back. 

1237
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,280
Why? 

1238
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:19,440
I don't know. I keep thinking I can't send anything. 

1239
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,720
But if you write it, then you can't... 

1240
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,760
Why don't you put them in the book and then send it to me? 

1241
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,840
OK. 

1242
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,280
Like a book of post-it notes. 

1243
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,280
OK. Or maybe I could just send each post-it note. 

1244
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:35,240
Yeah, OK. Yeah. Yeah. 

1245
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:40,040
What, like, "Went to this exhibition"? 

1246
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:41,200
Yeah. 

1247
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,760
"Went to the theatre". 

1248
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,040
"Went shopping". 

1249
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,320
"Bought bananas". 

1250
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:46,760
"Fed the cat". 

1251
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,840
"Fed the cat". 

1252
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,920
- OK. 
- Yeah. 

1253
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,320
- I'll do all that. 
- Right. 

1254
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,520
Yeah, be nice. 

1255
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,080
You will get them? 

1256
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,200
- At some point. 
- OK. 

1257
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:01,760
OK. 

1258
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,000
How does it look? 

1259
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,640
Is that straight? Oh, sorry, Mum. 

1260
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:31,440
Tiny bit down on the right. Tiny. 

1261
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,400
Doesn't want to, does it? 

1262
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:37,560
It's all right, though. 

1263
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,560
- It's fine. 
- It doesn't, you're right. 

1264
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,880
Feels smaller in here, with that up. 

1265
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,720
Yes, it does. 

1266
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,360
Still doesn't look straight. 

1267
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,400
The ceilings in here are wonky, though, right? 

1268
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,960
- That's right. 
- It's not just me. 

1269
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,000
No. 

1270
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,560
What are you doing, Mum? 

1271
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,480
Just gathering. 

1272
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:14,320
A few books, a few papers. Don't want to leave anything behind. 

1273
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,280
Mmm. Oh, I've got one of your books. 

1274
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,600
Oh, have you? 

1275
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,760
I'll give it back to you. 

1276
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:19,960
Which one? 

1277
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,920
The Boyd. 

1278
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,920
Oh, great. Did you enjoy it? 

1279
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,040
I've barely started it. 

1280
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,400
You can read it on the train. 

1281
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,640
Yeah. 

1282
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,120
Yeah. 

1283
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,360
OK. 

1284
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,360
Morning. Housekeeping. 

1285
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,480
Hello? 

1286
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:01,600
Hello? We'll be right down. 

1287
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,720
Right. We're kind of ready. Yes. 

1288
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:11,880
What have you got in here? 

1289
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,880
- Oh, I'm so sorry. 
- Hello? 

1290
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,480
OK, OK. 

1291
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,320
Sorry. 

1292
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,120
OK. Erm... 

1293
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,040
- Cynthia? 
- Yeah? 

1294
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,800
Could you have a check in the kitchen 

1295
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,320
for chargers and things like that? 

1296
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,560
Yeah. 

1297
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,440
OK. 

1298
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:58,440
Erm, OK. Quickly. It's for you. 

1299
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,320
All clear. 

1300
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,400
Can you make sure you put these cases to one side, 

1301
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:04,880
because they're for the boat. 

1302
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:05,920
Yeah. 

1303
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,280
- Thank you. 
- God, that's heavy. 

1304
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,880
OK. 

1305
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,240
Erm, yeah, I think that's it. 

1306
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:15,400
Thanks! 

1307
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,280
Bye! 

1308
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,640
Just grab my bag. 

1309
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:22,040
- Great. 
- Goodbye, thank you! 

1310
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:23,120
Bye, thank you! 

1311
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,240
Bye, house.
