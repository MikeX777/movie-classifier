1
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,500
Dear god in heaven,
it's me, Frankie.

2
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,302
Look, I know I probably ain't

3
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,971
One of your favorite people
down here.

4
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,840
I done some bad things
here and there,

5
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:18,010
And I know I been asking
for a lot favors lately, too,

6
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:21,013
So maybe I used
most of mine up.

7
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:22,898
I know you probably tried
to help me out

8
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,483
With this lottery thing
tonight,

9
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,735
But the way
things are going,

10
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:28,854
It doesn't look as if
it's going to work out,

11
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,224
So i'm asking
for one more favor--

12
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,043
Please don't add insult
to injury here, god.

13
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,211
Please, i'm begging you.

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,530
I don't want to win
the lottery.

15
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:39,998
I don't want to win
the lottery.

16
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,950
I don't want to win
the lottery.

17
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,335
I don't want to win
the lottery...

18
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,620
Hi. Name, please.

19
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,405
I'm Frank pesce.

20
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,325
P-e-s...

21
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,193
C-e.

22
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,363
Ok, here you are,
Frank. I'm julie.

23
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,365
Welcome
to the empire stakes.

24
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,167
Follow me.

25
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,802
I have you down for 6.

26
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,370
Where's the rest
of the family?

27
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,538
What?

28
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,806
Where's the rest
of the family?

29
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,040
It's only me.

30
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:42,728
Oh. So, what are you
going to do if you win?

31
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,096
I really don't know.

32
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:45,647
Come on,
tell me the truth.

33
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:47,099
Do you feel lucky tonight?

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,603
You have no idea.

35
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,249
Good luck, mr. Pesce.

36
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:08,921
Hey, how you doing?

37
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,923
Good luck to you, man.

38
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,674
Yeah, you, too.

39
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,881
Ladies and gentlemen,
mr. Memory lane himself--

40
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,849
Joe Franklin!

41
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:29,141
Ok. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

42
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:32,144
The big moment has arrived
at long last--

43
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:35,530
The very first
new york state lottery--

44
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,533
The empire stakes,
with some lucky person

45
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,454
Receiving $6,200,000.

46
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,290
The very first
in new york state.

47
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,577
I know the excitement
has been mounting

48
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,945
And generating
and mushrooming

49
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,246
And snowballing
and escalating

50
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,298
And skyrocketing,

51
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:55,167
And the, uh...

52
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,052
Contestants out there,

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,339
The audience--
you're kind of palpitating

54
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:01,840
And drooling
and salivating

55
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,843
And getting ready now
for the moment.

56
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,678
The moment has arrived.

57
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:13,435
And the lucky, lucky
person is...

58
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,822
Mr. Frank pesce!

You had to do this to me!

73
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:14,923
You weren't happy
leaving me alone, were you?

74
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,091
Were you?

75
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:18,977
I'll kill you!

76
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:21,730
Aah!

77
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,698
I never wanted
the damn ticket!

78
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,201
Why did you
give it to me?

79
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,236
I get up every morning!

80
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,739
I'm fine!
I'm a nice guy!

81
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,241
I know I do
some things wrong!

82
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,461
I was perfectly happy
in my life without it!

83
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,964
You couldn't leave me
alone, could you?

84
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,465
What's going on
out here?

85
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,334
What the hell
is your problem?

86
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,336
Frank, is that you?

87
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:46,088
And you!

88
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,173
What the hell
do you want?

89
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,592
Get back in
there, lowery!

90
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,094
What are you doing?

91
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,962
Don't you know
that it's christmas eve?

92
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,399
A lot of good you ever
did me, you priest!

93
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,318
A lot of good
you ever did me!

94
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,470
I'm going to call
the cops on you, Frank.

95
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,638
I'm catholic!

96
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,908
I can do whatever
the hell I want!

97
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,830
Oh, tartaglia,
the atheist is here.

98
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:13,331
Bring him in.

99
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,916
Honey, I got to go.
Merry christmas.

100
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:15,984
Yeah,
I love you, too.

101
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,152
Say hello
to the kids for me.

102
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,336
Look, sergeant, you got
to let me go, all right?

103
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:20,755
I ain't got
a lot of time here.

104
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:23,425
This priest wants
to press charges.

105
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,760
You messed up
his manger.

106
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,413
Father lowery,
i'm sorry.

107
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:30,665
All right?

108
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,667
Well, all right.

109
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,469
All right.

110
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,856
But why did you
do it, Frankie?

111
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,275
Just let me go,
all right?

112
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,277
Look, I just
can't sit here

113
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,229
And bullshit
with you guys.

114
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,781
Uncuff him.

115
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,284
Great.

116
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,787
You know, Frank, I checked
on what you said.

117
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:55,824
Your brother is
a cop with the 1-8.

118
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,325
You got no prior record.

119
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,827
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

120
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,379
You look like
a nice italian kid.

121
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,381
What the hell
are you doing

122
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,883
Throwing snowballs
at the church,

123
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,384
Scaring the priest?

124
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,887
It's christmas eve.
Don't you belong somewhere?

125
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:10,088
Anchorman on TV:
AND THE WINNER TONIGHT--

126
00:08:10,174 --> 00:08:13,208
Frank pesce
of queens, new york,

127
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,377
Who will take home
$6.2 million.

128
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,129
When his name
was called

129
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:19,881
And he failed
to come forward,

130
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,067
Ushers discovered
that mr. Pesce

131
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:24,152
Apparently had left
the drawing ceremony.

132
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:27,155
At any rate, congratulations
to Frank pesce

133
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:30,158
Of queens, new york,
wherever you are.

134
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,160
Turn it off,
will you?

135
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,662
New yorkers are crying over more
bad economic news today.

136
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,165
Some say our city
is going down--

137
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,035
That's you?

138
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,920
Same guy?

139
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,371
Yeah.

140
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,375
And then you went and broke
windows in the church?

141
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,744
What are you,
some kind of mammalucco?

142
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:54,182
Yeah, well, it's
a long story, you know?

143
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:56,685
You're not going anywhere.
Neither am i.

144
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,921
Not until you make some
kind of sense out of this.

145
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,106
I swear to god,

146
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,424
The only way I know how
to tell this story

147
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,759
Is from the beginning.

148
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,028
I got all night.

149
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,904
You see,
I got this, uh...

150
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,707
I got this curse.

151
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:23,962
I've been lucky since
the day I was born.

152
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,915
It's like my mother.

153
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,918
She used to work
at lincoln hospital,

154
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,921
So that's where
I was supposed to be born.

155
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,924
But she went into labor
at a bingo parlor

156
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,676
A couple of blocks
from where we live,

157
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,394
So they had to rush her

158
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:43,231
TO BELLEVUE HOSPITAL
ON 29th STREET INSTEAD.

159
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,234
Actually, that was
my first stroke of luck,

160
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,736
Because on that very night

161
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,739
Lincoln hospital ended up
having a huge fire,

162
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:53,742
And the place nearly
burned to the ground.

163
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,744
1-7. Vito, where you--

164
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:58,747
1-7. Hold it.
603 is the combination.

165
00:09:58,815 --> 00:09:59,914
60 cents.

166
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,416
10 cents a weigh.

167
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,918
No, the others are
straight action, shadow.

168
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:06,254
Straight action.

169
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,756
Madeline,
hey, huh, huh?

170
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,257
717 for $1.20.

171
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:11,176
Mr. Pesce?

172
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:14,095
Shadow, i'll get
right back to you.

173
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:16,965
Would you like
to see your son?

174
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,183
Come on, madeline.
Let's go see your brother.

175
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,267
Come on, come on.

176
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,435
Let's go.

177
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,980
My mom said
he always cried

178
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,983
When he saw us
for the first time--

179
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,202
My brother, my sister, me.

180
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,242
Come on!

181
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,997
We're going to be late.

182
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,165
I'm coming!

183
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,050
20 minutes from here
to radio city.

184
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,701
I got you a hot dog.
You don't want nothing?

185
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,886
I'm not hungry.

186
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:56,054
Come on, let's walk.
It's such a beautiful day.

187
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:57,222
All right, let's go.

188
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:58,223
Come on, we got
about 8 blocks, right?

189
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:59,341
Yeah, but
we're going to see

190
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,925
Student prince.
Come on.

191
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,100
When I was younger,
my dad used to always seem

192
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:10,602
Like this giant to me,

193
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,104
This guy who knew everything
about everything.

194
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,606
What are you
looking at?

195
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:15,774
That.

196
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:16,941
What's that?

197
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:18,827
What's that say?

198
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,028
Oh, that says,

199
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,164
"Today is president
eisenhower's birthday."

200
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:26,167
I want to get
my name up there.

201
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:28,670
I wouldn't want to have it
any other way, Frankie,

202
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,839
But only great people
get their names up there.

203
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,957
How can I get
my name up there?

204
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,377
You know, you got to do
something big, Frankie.

205
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,511
Big.

206
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:37,846
How big?

207
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:40,849
Very, very big,
you got to do.

208
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,016
How big?

209
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,468
Well, uh...

210
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,053
This big.

211
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:49,974
I guess every son

212
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,726
Wants to make his father
proud of him,

213
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,396
You know, so he doesn't feel
like a jerk for having you.

214
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,816
And I figured if I could get
my name up on that building,

215
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,067
At least
I could have left

216
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,335
Some kind of mark
on the world.

217
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,336
Frank, Sr.: MAYBE YOU'LL
SING LIKE MARIO LANZA.

218
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:02,804
You ever hear
of him?

219
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:03,805
Frank:
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

220
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:06,291
There were, like,
2 ways to make it.

221
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,575
One's the right way,

222
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,160
And the other way's
the fast way.

223
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:10,495
And I got to tell you,

224
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,946
The fast way looked
pretty attractive to me

225
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,131
As a kid.

226
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,467
Wow, look at that.

227
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:19,671
♪ you went away
and left me a long time ago ♪

228
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:20,839
That's louie tucci.

229
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,974
He's the biggest wise guy
in the neighborhood.

230
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,093
He's poison.
Don't even look at him.

231
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,896
Yeah, but I still
like his car.

232
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:31,266
♪ but you can't come in ♪

233
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,268
You'd be better off
walking, Frankie.

234
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,853
Come on.

235
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:38,189
♪ I hear you knockin'... ♪

236
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:40,641
My dad could always
talk circles around everybody.

237
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,143
I swear, the guy
should've run for office

238
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,312
And been a politician.

239
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,531
There was this odd thing
goin' on

240
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:47,916
Between him and louie tucci.

241
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,951
I knew my father
couldn't stand him,

242
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,286
Yet they seemed to be spending
a lot of time together,

243
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,788
Especially when my dad
lost his trucking company,

244
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,790
Which i'll get to later.

245
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:56,958
Hi, Frankie.

246
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,929
Dad, you say
don't look at the guy

247
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,430
Because he's no good,

248
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,216
Then you hang
around with him.

249
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:06,501
You mean tucci?

250
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,602
Yeah.

251
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,638
Come on, Frankie.
It's business.

252
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,474
You in business
with that guy?

253
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:16,728
Never.
You see, Frankie,

254
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,396
I don't want to be
in business with him.

255
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,031
I don't want to spend
any time

256
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,483
With a guy like that.

257
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,451
That's why
you were with him?

258
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,452
Yeah.

259
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:25,987
Because you don't
want to be?

260
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,489
That's right.

261
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,491
You mean,
you spend time with him

262
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,243
Because you don't want
to spend time with him?

263
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:33,861
That's exactly right.

264
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,246
If I spent
less time with him,

265
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,832
I'd have to spend
even more time with him.

266
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:41,002
So if you spent
no time with him...

267
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,922
Then i'd be with him
constantly.

268
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,424
I can't wait
until I grow up, pop,

269
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,311
So I can know what the hell
you're talking about.

270
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:53,147
Get out of here,
wise guy.

271
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,768
Frankie!

272
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:58,269
Don't be late.

273
00:13:58,355 --> 00:14:00,388
Mama's cooking
ciccia baste.

274
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,556
Yeah, dad.

275
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,890
Growing up didn't help.

276
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,225
I still don't know

277
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,027
What the hell
he's talking about.

278
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,749
Now, this luck thing

279
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,751
Kept on happening
time after time.

280
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,587
Like I remember one time

281
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:17,121
I was hanging out
with my friend jimmy vitello,

282
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:19,290
Whose father
was also in the mob.

283
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:22,794
In fact, he was the biggest
mobster in the tri-state area.

284
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,295
Come on.
Let's go.

285
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,597
Let's go.

286
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,434
Wow!

287
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,252
Can you believe it?

288
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,753
It was just
laying here.

289
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,940
Hey, let's take it down
to irv's and pawn it.

290
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:38,977
I'll give you $5.00.

291
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,144
$5.00?

292
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,646
Are you nuts?

293
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:42,864
Thing must be worth

294
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,649
A couple
of hundred bucks.

295
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,985
Yeah, don't be
a fucking stiff.

296
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,486
Ooh, what a mouth you got.

297
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,988
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

298
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:52,490
Where did you
get this?

299
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:53,658
Huh?

300
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,159
God left it
for us.

301
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:56,878
Oh, well, I don't want him
coming around here

302
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,162
Looking for it.

303
00:14:58,248 --> 00:14:59,614
Get it out of here.

304
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,781
Huh?

305
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,884
Irv, you know
who my father is.

306
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,969
We don't want to have
a little misunderstanding,

307
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,754
Now, do we?

308
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,256
Jeez, all right.

309
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,807
All right.

310
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,926
You're something else,
you know that?

311
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,094
Here.

312
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,562
10 bucks.

313
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,730
That's it.

314
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:16,814
Now get out of here,
little bastards.

315
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,132
Go ahead.

316
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,135
Now, to a kid,
this seemed very impressive.

317
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,637
All you had to do

318
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,138
Was mention
jimmy vitello's father,

319
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,140
And, boom, you got
whatever the hell you wanted.

320
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,110
So no matter how far
out of line jimmy got,

321
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,145
The cops never showed up
at his house.

322
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,649
However, a member
of new york's finest

323
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,150
Did end up
in our house.

324
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,003
My brother vito decided
to become a cop.

325
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:40,338
Personally,i think
it was like

326
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:41,506
Getting a wolf
to watch the chickens.

327
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:42,790
Pesce, vito.

328
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,841
But at least somebody
was doing something

329
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,961
For the family name.

330
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,468
Vallamone,
ronald.

331
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:58,339
Meanwhile I hung around
with a bunch of guys

332
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:02,360
Who were doing absolutely
nothing with their lives.

333
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,446
There was lenny nipton.

334
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,448
You know, we called him
needle nose.

335
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:08,950
This guy was
the definition

336
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,451
Of postnasal drip.

337
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,736
Hey, Frank.

338
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:14,522
You know something, Frank?
Girls love poetry.

339
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,690
Dig this.

340
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,409
Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow

341
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,412
Creeps, baby,
in its petty pace.

342
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:24,031
Then there was
dom the bomb.

343
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,801
♪ hello, Frankie,
how are you today ♪

344
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,869
♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, now ♪

345
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,256
This guy actually
thought he could sing.

346
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:33,758
What are you going to do?
I got to lose some weight.

347
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,259
I think
I got a gland problem.

348
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:37,929
Rocky sav
had a gland problem

349
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,514
Ever since the day
he was born.

350
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,015
Poor sal las benas.

351
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,651
He spit on everything in sight
whenever he talked.

352
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,653
And then there was
jimmy vitello.

353
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:48,322
Frankie boy, how you doing?
Want to make some money?

354
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,224
$10,000 cash, tax-free.

355
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,393
Frank, we had some pizza
the other night...

356
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,496
♪ and if you promise
not to run away ♪

357

While I was hanging
around in the street

364
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:08,543
Bullshitting
with my friends all day long,

365
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,411
My dad was out
breaking his ass.

366
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,912
Ever since he lost
his own company,

367
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,882
He had been working as a driver
for some other outfit.

368
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,256
So every day he had to take
the subway to penn station,

369
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,391
Then he would catch
a connecting train

This city is going

378
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,083

That's what we need.

383
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,924
You know, pop, it's funny
that you're saying that,

384
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,227
Because of what
I been thinking.

385
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,562
I can't wait
to hear this.

386
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,564
The way I got
it figured, right,

387
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,566
Is that the future
is in outer space.

388
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,802
Maybe I could
become an astronaut.

389
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,021
It's the last
frontier, pop.

390
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,573
An astronaut?

391
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,075
Well,
think about it.

392
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,693
Look, pop,
I could become

393
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,912

394
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,414
No, don't laugh.

395
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:23,367
I want to--

396
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:26,370

I never done before.

00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:27,655
Oh, I see.

398
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,657
Why don't you try

No.

451
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:31,963

452
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:33,047
So?

453
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:34,548
I'm a man of principle.

454
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:37,551

times what it's worth!

00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,126
You making a joke,
Frankie?

459
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,645

462
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,600
I heard
it's going to rain.

463
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:53,968
That ain't
what I heard.

464
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,519
What the hell did you hear?

465
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:56,520
Never mind, Frankie.

466
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:57,772
Where
did you hear rain?

467
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,573
Madeline, I heard it
on the radio.

468
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,909
The weatherman said
it's going to rain tomorrow.

469
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:02,910
Typical, vito.

470
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:03,911
You listen
to the radio.

471
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,246
They're
always wrong.

472
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,999
Hold it. Do me a favor with
the goddamn weather here.

473
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:10,201

with the rain, with mars.

Who gives a shit?

475
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:13,821
Who gives a shit
about sun and rain?

476
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:14,839
I do, pop.

477
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:16,924
You don't pay $10 to
get your hair done.

478
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,093
My hair frizzes
in the rain.

479
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,045
Vito: LISTEN, WITCH,
LEAVE YOUR BROOM AT HOME.

480
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,346
Don't go out.
Your hair won't get wet.

481
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:24,665
That was good one,
wasn't it?

482
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:25,666
Know what, vito?
I got a 2-seater,

483
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:29,720
So you can just jump
right on with me.

484
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,005
Fucking shit!

485
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,641
Who's going to marry you
with a mouth like that?

486
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,644
2 months later,
she married a sicilian guy

487
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:37,862
Named tony.

488
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:47,204
And tony didn't make too big
of a hit with the family.

489
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:09,260
Now, the vietnam war
was raging full force.

490
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,818
Guys from the neighborhood

491
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,604
Were coming home in boxes
every week.

492
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:27,278
We all got letters
in the mail

493
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:30,081
And had to go to
the draft board to sign up,

494
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:34,085
So we were about to do what
was right for our country.

495
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,586
You know,
I just developed

496
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:36,587
A theory on life.

497
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:37,755
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

498
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,256
Ok, listen, because
it's very complicated.

499
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,742
First you're born,

500
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:42,760
And you're like a baby,
a child.

501
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:45,763
And then you start
to mature a little

502
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:47,765
After you hit
your "adio-lescence."

503
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,266
Then you grow old.

504
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:50,768
And then
you grow older.

505
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,219
And then you die.

506
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,771
And that's it.

507
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,974
Rocky sav, no offense,

508
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,145
But that's the stupidest
fucking thing I ever heard.

509
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,646
Rocky:
ALL RIGHT, LAUGH,

510
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:05,649
But if you stop
and think about it,

511
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,267
It makes
a lot of sense.

512
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,906
Nearly a thousand
18-year-olds

513
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,408
From every part
of the city were there.

514
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,576
Getting a load
of these guys,

515
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,211
I figured we could win
the vietnam war

516
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,630
In about 15 minutes.

517
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,666
Quiet down!

518
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,670
Quiet down in here!

519
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,791
Hey, rocky, whoa!

520
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,310
When you going
to grow up?

521
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:35,462
Quiet down,
you shitheads!

522
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,898
Street trash
motherfuckers!

523
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:40,801
Marrone. This guy
looks tough.

524
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,803
Yeah, he looks
real tough,

525
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,972
Don't he, Frank?

526
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,140
Yeah.

527
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,808
Sergeant: ALL RIGHT!

528
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,477
As of this minute,

529
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,480
All of you here

530
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,983
Is now the property

531
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,003
Of the united states
government!

532
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:03,257
Now, if anybody here

533
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,926
Has been in jail...

534
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:09,430
Who is out on bail...

535
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:15,136
Please move to the right
side of the auditorium!

536
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:27,448
The whole fucking room
got up.

537
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,956
You got to be
shitting me.

538
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:38,876
Excuse me, sir?

539
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,628
Excuse me?

540
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,364
I really don't think
it's fair

541
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,301
That we got to take a test
that we didn't study for.

542
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:51,472
It's a goddamn
urine examination, boy!

543
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,973
I'm sorry.
I misunderstood.

544
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,975
I thought it was
something else.

545
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:57,228
What's your name, boy?

546
00:24:58,547 --> 00:24:59,647
Pesce.

547
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,398
Frank pesce, sir.

548
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:05,903
You know, pesce
means fish in italian.

549
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:09,907
I don't give a good
god damn what it means!

550
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,275
I'm sorry, sir.

551
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,778
Is there something
wrong with you, boy?

552
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:21,568
No, n-n-not that
i'm aware of, sir.

553
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,421
You got
a high school diploma?

554
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:25,422
No, sir.

555
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:29,960
You ain't got no
high school diploma?

556
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:31,595
No, sir.
No diploma.

557
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:33,130
No, sir.

558
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:42,890
I think
he likes you.

559
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:45,943
Ok,
cover your left eye

560
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:49,063
And read line 7
on the chart.

561
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:57,938
"Tagglethorp."

562
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,124
Get out of here.

563
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,493
All right.

564
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,412
Pesce!
Frank pesce!

565
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,414
Where the hell
is Frank pesce?

566
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:08,966
Pesce!

567
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,468
Frank pesce, get the
hell over here, boy!

568
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:12,720
Yes, sir?

569
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:13,954
Did I not ask you

570
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,924
If you had
a high school diploma?

571
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,726
Yes, sir,
you asked me that.

572
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,060
I remember you
asking me that.

573
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:23,180
And what
did you tell me?

574
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,234
That I didn't have one.

575
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:28,736
According to my files,

576
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:32,740
You have
a high school diploma.

577
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,742
Well, yeah, I got one...

578
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,910
Just not on me.

579
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:38,946
You get the hell up there
and see the psychiatrist.

580
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,082
Move it, boy!
Get the hell up there!

581
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:43,367
You got 4 cards
in your hand--

582
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:44,668
I don't know
what I should do.

583
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,920
It's too early
in the game.

584
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:50,674
You don't want
to build it up the back,

585
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,459
Then you wind up
in trouble.

586
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,961
You going
to tell me?

587
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,212
Here comes
general custer.

588
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:58,215
Jesus. Come here, Frank.
I want to talk to you.

589
00:26:58,301 --> 00:26:59,683
10 million guys are
tryin' to beat the draft,

590
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:00,634
And only you
can get away with it.

591
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:01,885
What do you mean?

592
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,887
You see this letter?
Know what it says?

593
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:05,389
It says the united states
government

594
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:07,391
Thinks that you are
a calculated risk.

595
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:09,393
Is that good or bad?

596
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:12,029
It means that they
think you are nuts.

597
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:13,180
So now the army knows

598
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,448
What the whole
neighborhood knows.

599
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:15,616
You're fucking crazy.

600
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,618
I'm very sorry
i'm letting you guys down

601
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,820
By not stepping
on a land mine.

602
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,355
What's so funny?

603
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,240
I'm supposed to go to all
my friends in the neighborhood

604
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:24,358
And say that
my son's nutjob--

605
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,526
That's why
he's not in the army? Huh?

606
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,879
You got to have
mental illness, right?

607
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:30,414
And i'll tell you
something else--

608
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:31,882
You're ruined!
You're ruined!

609
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:35,135
You'll never get
a city job! Never!

610
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:36,637
Oh, excuse me.

611
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:39,840
I'll just get a rope.
I'll hang myself.

612
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,176
Mentally disqualified.

613
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,561
This reflects
on the whole family.

614
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,180
Frank:
SO I GOT OUT OF THE WAR,

615
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:47,931
But I knew it
was no accident.

616
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,016
It was my lucky star.

617
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,101
All right,
wait a minute.

618
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:52,936
I'm trying to figure
out what I got here.

619
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:54,772
What do you have
to figure out?

620
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,243

And it ended up being

663

I want to make an announcement.
A family announcement here.

664
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:46,467
I'd like to congratulate
my youngest son Frankie, jr.,

665
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,970
Who bears my name,
for having been fired today.

666
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:51,838
Leave him alone.

667
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,173
What are you,
kiddin'?

668
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,176
You held that job
for what--8 months?

669
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,677
That's a record with you.

670
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,113
I'm pointing out
your progress.

671
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:01,615
Dad, I didn't
like that job anyway.

672
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:04,017
Besides, I got
a new angle on my life.

673
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,403
I can't wait
to hear this.

674
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:07,571
Yeah, me, too.

675
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:08,989
Shut up!

676
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,960
While I was
working there,

677
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:13,961
I was thinking,
you know,

678
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,963
I never had to look
at the board.

679
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,465
I always knew which
trains went where.

680
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,467
I knew every
schedule by heart.

681
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,002
You know what
that means, right?

682
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,203
Yeah.

683
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,472
You got a natural talent
for useless information.

684
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,475
No! It means I got
a good head for numbers.

685
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:30,477
Maybe I could be
an accountant or something.

686
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:31,979
That's a terrific idea,
Frankie.

687
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,981
You can't do that
on account.

688
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,482
On account of what?

689
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:37,484
On account of
you're a moron!

690
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:39,570
Oh, stop it!

691
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,056
If they make you
a detective,

692
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,058
Anything is possible,
you hard-on.

693
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,059
Hey,
don't curse.

694
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,394
Can I shoot him
for saying that?

695
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,562
Now, hold it. Hold it.

696
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,532
I got something
very serious to say here.

697
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:54,868
I've been thinking
about that lawn out there.

698
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,870
Bluegrass of kentucky--
what do you think?

699
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,422
I got a relative
in kentucky, pop.

700
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:01,091
Shut up! What
the hell is it?

701
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:03,377
It's the best
grass there is.

702
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:04,911
Grass is grass, pop.

703
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,263
You know, you don't know
a damn thing

704
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:07,848
About anything
do you?

705
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,933
Oh, marrone! Enough
with this lawn already!

706
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,134
Yeah, you're driving
everybody crazy

707
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,436
With that lawn.

708
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:13,720
Oh, yeah?

709
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,113
What happened, tony?

710
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,616
Got dressed
in a hurry tonight?

711
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:26,900
You left your shirt home?

712
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,035
Why don't you ask her?

713
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,486
She hasn't done
the wash in a week.

714
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:30,621
What?

715
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:31,822
What do you mean,
"her," "she"?

716
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,323
Her name's madeline.

717
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:35,792
And what is she,
your servant?

718
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,794
Oh, yeah, like i'm
not your servant?

719
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,795
That's different.

720
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:41,281
Ha. How's it
different?

721
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,883
It's different,
that's all.

722
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,619
Pop, could you just not
start tonight, please?

723
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,120
Ma, thanks
for the spaghetti.

724
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,338
It was great.

725
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:50,641
What is this, eat and run?
Where you going?

726
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:51,808
I'm going out.
Can't you tell?

727
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:52,959
Where you going?

728
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:54,595
I got a date.

729
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:55,929
With who?

730
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,514
With a girl.

731
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,066
Hmm. What girl?

732
00:31:59,101 --> 00:31:59,983
Vito:
MARIA.

733
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,184
Who's maria?

734
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:03,236
You know the spanish girl
from spanish harlem,

735
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,804
The one you told him
to stay away from?

736
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:05,805
3 months he's
been a detective,

737
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:06,990
And already, he's
narcing on everybody.

738
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:08,475
Hey, he's right.

739
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:11,445
Ma, you know
where my gun is?

740
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:14,147
Frankie, I told you
to stay away from her.

741
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,116
Dad, she's
a nice girl.

742
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,334
Did you see my service
revolver around?

743
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:18,452
I'm late.

744
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:20,170
Look, I don't care
how nice she is, ok?

745
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:21,755
She's spanish.
She's a puerto rican,

746
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:25,125
And historically,
puerto ricans hate italians.

747
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,961
You go up to spanish harlem,
you're gonna get hurt.

748
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,463
Where's my gun?

749
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:30,964
Enough with the gun!

750
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,433
What, do I got to do
everything around here?

751
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,668
I got to find
your gun?

752
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,436
Maybe I should ride
in the car with you?

753
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:37,638
Dad, her brother jesus

754
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,473
Loves me like a brother,
all right?

755
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,725
Do what you want.

756
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,884
Bye.

757
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:14,925
Hey, jesus,
how you doing?

758
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,929
Quit fucking
with my sister!

759
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,442
Help me.

760
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:34,077
Help me.

761
00:33:34,163 --> 00:33:35,579
Help me!

762
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:37,447
Help me!

763
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,783
Is this
a catholic hospital?

764
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:41,284
I'm a catholic.

765
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,286
If i'm going to die,

766
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:46,123
I want to die
in a catholic hospital.

767
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,926
Dr. Puccini
wants to talk to you.

768
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:51,745
It's nothing serious.
It's just a little problem.

769
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,213
He just wants to talk
to you just for a minute.

770
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,515
You all right?

771
00:33:55,584 --> 00:33:57,851
Looks good, huh?

772
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,636
How are you, Frank?

773
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:02,105
What it is? I'm going
to be ok, ain't i?

774
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:03,940
God was good to you
on this one.

775
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,358
If you hadn't
received this injury,

776
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:06,443
We would
have never caught

777
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,195
This other problem
in time.

778
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,929
What? What is it?

779
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:12,733
I'm going to be ok,
ain't i?

780
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,484
X-rays show
that you have a tumor

781
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,736
On one of your ribs,

782
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,237
Right below
your stab wound.

783
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,238
A tumor?

784
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,373
That's cancer.

785
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:22,959
I'm going to have to go
in there and remove it.

786
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:26,079
What's with his eyes?

787
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,581
Mrs. Pesce: IT'S A LITTLE
CONDITION OR SOMETHING.

788
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,782
Condition?

789
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,117
It's funny.

790
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,053
No, it ain't funny.

791
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:34,788
This guy's going
to cut me open

792
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,306
And look inside of me?

793
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:38,958
One minute, he's looking
at the air conditioner,

794
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,227
The next minute,
he's looking at me.

795
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,795
Frankie,
you got to calm down.

796
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:42,929
You got to
take it easy.

797
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,015
This surgeon
is one of the finest

798
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,800
In new york.

799
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,302
He operated
on cousin ernie's lungs.

800
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,471
Cousin ernie's dead.

801
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,972
That couldn't be helped.

802
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,808
He died
of a heart attack.

803
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,309
His lungs were clean.

804
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,944
Announcer on TV:
THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY--

805
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,580
A simple, dignified,
low-cost alternative

806
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:01,832
To the high-priced funeral,

807
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:03,917
Wants you to spend
your money on the living,

808
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:05,318
Not the undertaker...

809
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Look at that.

810
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,323
That's one of dr. Puccini's
patients up there right now.

811
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,325
What are you
laughing about?

812
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,461
It ain't funny, man.

813
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:22,769
Now, i'm out of my mind
with depression.

814
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:24,838
I go see this nun on my floor
for a little spiritual advice

815
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,022
To help me
through all of this.

816
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:27,674
You know what she says?

817
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:31,945
Whatever is god's will
is god's will, my son.

818
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,484
The truth is,
that it was cancer,

819
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:40,620
But I ended up beating it
because they caught it in time.

820
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:43,123
Needless to say,
I recovered quickly.

821
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:45,125
Even though
we lived in queens,

822
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:47,127
I WAS ALWAYS
ON 29th STREET

823
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:48,628
'cause that's where
the action was.

824
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:51,665

828
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:03,093
The club was run
by philly the nap,

829
00:36:03,178 --> 00:36:04,311
The local bookmaker

830
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:05,812
Who smelled like he was
constantly sucking

831
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,213
On a clove
of garlic.

832
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,983
Philly the Nap:
YOU DIDN'T FUCKING BET?

833
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,269
How can you get
such great cards like this

834
00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:14,187
And be so fucking stupid?

835
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,689
God protects
the dumb.

836
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,241
You got
lifetime protection.

837
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:20,026
How about this one, huh?

838
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:22,195
How does a guy get stabbed
up in spanish harlem

839
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,063
And have it turn into
the thing that saves his life?

840
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:27,066
The problem is,
you got the luck.

841
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,702
You were born with it.

842
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:29,836
The pitiful part is,

843
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:31,121
You don't know what
the hell to do with it.

844
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:32,455
Some people are born
with it,

845
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,907
And they know
what to do with it.

846
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,425
Now, if i...

847
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,960
There he
goes again.

848
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,930
Philly the nap,
a narcoleptic.

849
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:42,432
He would nod out
without warning,

850
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:45,769
And a second later,
he'd snap out of it.

851
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:49,439
How long
was I out?

852
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:51,441
3 1/2 weeks.

853
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:52,943
You're a wise guy, right?

854
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,444
And you...

855
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:56,947
Learn what to do
with the luck.

856
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:58,598
You got it.

857
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,599
Jesus, philly,

858
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,901
Take it downwind,
will you? Phew.

859
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:03,370
I don't want
that garlic.

860
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:05,488
Gloria!

861
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:07,941
What's up, baby?
How you doing?

862
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,114
Frank:
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU

863
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,617
About the right way
to make it

864
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,085
And the fast way?

865
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,922
The right way wasn't
working out too well for me,

866
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,174
So I decided
to try the fast way.

867
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:25,642
These heavyweight wise guys

868
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:26,643
Came up from mulberry street

869
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,311
To set up
a gambling operation.

870
00:37:28,397 --> 00:37:30,814
They chose
the bakery next door

871
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,148
AFTER TALKING
TO BILLY DeWOLF,

872
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:34,417
The guy who owned it.

873
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,604
Stay
the fuck out!

874
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:40,106
Man:
HEY, BILLY, HUH?

875
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:42,108
Frank:
STILL BEING A JERK-OFF,

876
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,210
I went and looked for a job
as a guy at the front door

877
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:47,113
Instead of looking
for honest employment.

878
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,250
So I talked to jimmy about
getting a job there.

879
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,919
Look,
my name's Frank.

880
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:55,171
I was told
to talk to you.

881
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:57,257
Yeah? And by who?

882
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,492
I--i can't say.

883
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,961
You know somebody?

884
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:01,962
Yeah.

885
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,330
But--but I can't say.

886
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,132
Who do you know?

887
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:09,335
I told you,
I can't--i can't say.

888
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,972
What the fuck is his name?

889
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:15,191
Jimmy vitello.

890
00:38:15,277 --> 00:38:17,343
You know, you should
never mention no names.

891
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,679
Never mention names
like that in this joint.

892
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,780
That's a bad thing to do.
Never, never, never say--

893
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:22,399
You asked me!

894
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:24,784
Am I nuts,
or did he ask me?

895
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:27,287
Frank:
ANYWAY, I GOT THE JOB,

896
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:29,289
And I had
enough money saved

897
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:30,824
To go in with vito
on a car.

898
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,325
Frank, Sr.: HO! HO! HO!

899
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,027
Who's going
to talk to the guy?

900
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,462
I'm talkin'.
This is bullshit.

901
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,663
You know what?

902
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,833
I want to order this car
before it goes out of date.

903
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:40,884
I'm going to order
the car!

904
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:42,002
Let him talk
to the guy.

905
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:44,254
Don't forget--white
with a white vinyl top,

906
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,007
A rear defroster,
am/fm stereo, tinted windows,

907
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,341
And a tilt wheel.

908
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,509
Vito, shut up,
all right?

909
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,927
FOR THE 200th TIME,

910
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:52,846
I know how
to order a car!

911
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:53,847
Just relax!

912
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,932
White with a white
vinyl top.

913
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,526
What's this?

914
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,062
This is not our car,
is it?

915
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,063
Yeah, it's the car.

916
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,281
What are you
talkin' about?

917
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:12,449
I told you
when you went in there,

918
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:13,867
White
with a white vinyl top!

919
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:14,901
The guy said--

920
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,403
I don't care
what the guy said!

921
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,405
I thought it was white.

922
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,590
We're partners on--
I don't want this.

923
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:21,741
I'm not going
to pay for it, either.

924
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:22,909
What's wrong
with it?

925
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:23,910
You stay there!
Come here.

926
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,462
Come here!
You stay over there.

927
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:26,579
Come here
for one minute.

928
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,214
Look, don't fuck around.

929
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,432
White with
a white vinyl top.

930
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:30,433
Come--

931
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,935
No. Stay there!

932
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,437
Dad, tell him
to stay there.

933
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:35,939
What is that?

934
00:39:36,024 --> 00:39:37,474
This is our car.

935
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,113
Come here.

936
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:45,832
Mungo Jerry: ♪ CHH CHH-CHH UH

00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:49,152

938
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:56,326

00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,328

Pop!

944
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,259
You know,
a man is judged

945
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,512
By the company
he keeps, Frankie.

946
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:17,814
That don't bode
to well for you, pop.

947
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,732
You're out here keeping
company with the crickets.

948
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,734
You're a smart ass, huh?

949
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,236
I'm still very capable

950
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:26,606
Of smacking the shit
out of you if I have to.

951
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,608
I mean, today you're
watching the door.

952
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,243
What are you
going to do tomorrow?

953
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:31,694
You going to hold
some guy down

954
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,113
While he hits them over
the head with a tire iron?

955
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:34,614
Dad, it's just
temporary, all right?

956
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,116
I'm saving the money up

957
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,817
So I can do
bigger things.

958
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,152
Yeah, like what?

959
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,453
I don't know.

960
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,988
Frankie, this is it.

961
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,990
This is all there is.

962
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,993
You get a job,
you make a living.

963
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,211
You meet a girl,
you get married,

964
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:50,130
And you have kids.

965
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:51,681
There's nothing else
to it.

966
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:53,183
Pop,
this can't be it.

967
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:55,501
What if I want to
do something else?

968
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,220
Like what?

969
00:40:57,305 --> 00:40:58,221
I don't know!

970
00:40:58,306 --> 00:40:59,505
Will you quit
asking me?

971
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,441
Look how miserable--
you're miserable.

972
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:02,442
You are.
You're miserable.

973
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,444
You know
what you got to do?

974
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,345
You got to
find yourself a hobby.

975
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:07,814
A hobby.

976
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,115
That's right.
You got to get something

977
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,950
That's going
to give you pleasure,

978
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,952
Like me and my lawn--

979
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:14,120
Get out!

980
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:15,655
You little bastard!

981
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,690
Have you gone
completely nuts?

982
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,192
Don't hit the cat!

983
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:22,629
The heat from his body's
burning a hole in my lawn.

984
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:25,081
Ha ha ha ha.

985
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:29,552
Isn't it a big difference?

986
00:41:29,638 --> 00:41:30,803
What?

987
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:34,007
The bluegrass of kentucky.

988
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,141
Different nothing, pop.

989
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,043
I don't notice
any difference.

990
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,145
You don't notice
no difference?

991
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:40,346
No.

992
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,899
That's because you don't
have the eye, Frankie.

993
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:44,184
The eye.

994
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,653
What eye?

995
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,571
The eye. The eye.

996
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:50,323
What eye?

997
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:51,390
If you had the eye,

998
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,326
You'd know
what I was talking about.

999
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:56,362
But obviously you don't
have the eye, Frankie.

1000
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:58,397
Well, pop, I tell you,
I wish I had this eye,

1001
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,899
Because then I would know

1002
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,567
What the hell
you were talking about.

1003
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,205
Well, i'm just listening
to a different drum, Frankie.

1004
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:07,040
So now there are drums.

1005
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,675
There's a lot of shit
happening out here,

1006
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,093
I tell you.

1007
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,262
That's right. The lottery
comes to new york. Take a look.

1008
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:14,747
Yeah, yeah, you and
20 million other people

1009
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,049
Seen that today,
all right?

1010
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,550
There's always hope, kid.

1011
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,419
Not for you, pop.
There's no hope.

1012
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:21,971
Bullshit.

1013
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,558
Hi, mom.

1014
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,859
How you doing?

1015
00:42:26,928 --> 00:42:28,061
Perfect timing.

1016
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,896
Get out of there!
What's the matter with you?

1017
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,064
Go wash your hands!

1018
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,149
You come in
bringing them germs

1019
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:34,951
And sticking them
in the sauce like that!

1020
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:37,954
Hey, out of my chair,
bub. Come on.

1021
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:40,456
Who died
and made you king?

1022
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:41,958
Just get out!

1023
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:44,460
I have
to go to work.

1024
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:45,962
I have a job,

1025
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:47,297
Not like
some people I know.

1026
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:48,381
Yeah? What are you doing,

1027
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,466
Staking out
a slumber party?

1028
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:51,968
Where's your father?

1029
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:54,470
He's outside with
the bluegrass of kentucky

1030
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:56,256
And the eye
and the drums.

1031
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:57,974
Frankie, don't give him
a hard time today.

1032
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:00,426
Why not?

1033
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:03,129
He got laid off
from work.

1034
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,630
He got laid off?

1035
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:05,982
You heard her.

1036
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,935
Would you go call
your father, huh?

1037
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:10,436
Get off your ass

1038
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,438
And go call
your father!

1039
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,940
All right, i'm going!

1040
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,441
That was serious.

1041
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,443
We were just getting by
as it was,

1042
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:18,995
And I knew that we were in
for some hard times.

1043
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,697
Now, at the same time,

1044
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:22,699
The neighborhood
was going nuts.

1045
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:24,951
Everybody had lotto fever.

1046
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:29,038
Me, I wouldn't have
anything to do with it.

1047
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:30,923
Hey, rocky,

1048
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:33,326
What you going to do
with your millions?

1049
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,828
If you don't play,
you don't win.

1050
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,046
That's original.

1051
00:43:37,132 --> 00:43:38,348
You're turning into

1052
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:40,049
A freakin' rockefeller,
rocky.

1053
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:41,834
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1054
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:44,337
My father could have
probably supported

1055
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,839
The new york state lottery
commission all by himself.

1056
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:50,443
He was going
for the big one.

1057
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:51,728
I know it ain't right,

1058
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,529
But i'd been collecting
unemployment checks

1059
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:55,031
While I was working
at the club.

1060
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:56,366
It was lucky, too,

1061
00:43:56,451 --> 00:43:58,034
Because I picked labor day
to cash that check.

1062
00:43:58,119 --> 00:43:59,869
The banks were closed.
The pawn shop

1063
00:43:59,954 --> 00:44:01,687
Was the only joint
on the block that was open.

1064
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,239
Hey, Frankie,

1065
00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:05,241
How are you?
Everything ok?

1066
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:06,576
How's the family?

1067
00:44:06,661 --> 00:44:07,794
Good.

1068
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:10,129
Your mother, your father?
Your beautiful sister?

1069
00:44:10,198 --> 00:44:12,882
Everybody's fine.

1070
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:15,034
Look, I got to cash
a check.

1071
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:17,920
You got an i.d.?

1072
00:44:18,006 --> 00:44:19,505
Irv...

1073
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:21,507
How's my sister,
how's my mother--

1074
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:22,842
You asking me
for i.d.?

1075
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,844
Frank, i'm sorry.
That's the way it is.

1076
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,430
You got to have
2 forms of identification.

1077
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:29,432
You know
who my father is?

1078
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:32,318
We don't want to have
a misunderstanding.

1079
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:33,820
Hey, hey. Well, ok.

1080
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:38,074
For you, Frankie,
i'll make an exception.

1081
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:39,659
Jeez, thanks, irv.

1082
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:43,229
But you got to buy something.
Minimum of 10 bucks.

1083
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,831
I got to buy something?

1084
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:45,832
Yeah.

1085
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,950
What am I going
to buy in this place,

1086
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:49,452
What,

1087
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:52,455
I'm no chase manhattan.
Minimum of 10 bucks.

1088
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
Irv, I swear to god,

1089
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,959
The same shit you had
here 20 years ago.

1090
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:58,294
All right, give me

1091
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,929

binoculars over there.

1092
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:01,414
Oh, yeah.

1093
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:04,517
Hey, Frank,
these are beautiful.

1094
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:05,518
Everything's beautiful.

1095
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:08,271
He wants to sell it.
What do you think?

1096
00:45:08,356 --> 00:45:10,390
9 bucks.

1097
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,358
Irv, come on!

1098
00:45:12,427 --> 00:45:14,427
I got to charge you 10.

1099
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:15,428
No.

1100
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,429
No, no.

1101
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,930
Make up
the difference.

1102
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:21,284
Give me one of them
lottery tickets.

1103
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:22,285
Beautiful.

1104
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,602
You got it, Frankie.

1105
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:24,954
You got it.

1106
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,458
Everything is a chore
with this guy.

1107
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:31,461
You got a beautiful pair
of binoculars there.

1108
00:45:31,546 --> 00:45:32,462
Yeah, beautiful.

1109
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:33,963
There you are.

1110
00:45:34,048 --> 00:45:36,282
All right.

1111
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:38,284
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

1112
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:39,618
Today, irv!
Come on!

1113
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,120
Come on, irv, huh?

1114
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,755
Come on, irv!

1115
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,458
Don't forget
the binoculars.

1116
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,927
I ain't going
to forget them.

1117
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,429
Cost me 9 bucks.

1118
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,930
Ha ha ha ha!

1119
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,465
Put it
on layaway.

1120
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:55,468
That was it. I thought
it was such a waste of money,

1121
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,021
I never told my father
I bought it.

1122
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,577
And then it happened.

1123
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:08,030
I was on the subway
sometime in november.

1124
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:26,549
Holy shit.

1125
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:29,335
Holy shit.
I don't believe it.

1126
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:30,669
I don't believe it.

1127
00:46:30,722 --> 00:46:32,939
I'm a finalist
in the lottery!

1128
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,942
Right here! I'm a finalist
in the lottery!

1129
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,443
I'm not kidding!
I'm not kidding! Look!

1130
00:46:37,512 --> 00:46:39,178
Wait, wait, wait,
look at this!

1131
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,446
Here! Here's the ticket!

1132
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,732
I got a shot
at $6.2 million!

1133
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:45,451
$6.2 million!

1134
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,239
Yay!
Yay!

1135
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,378
Mom, vito, you'll never
believe what happened!

1136
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:56,879
Mom, vito! Mom, mom!

1137
00:46:56,965 --> 00:47:00,333
I'm a finalist
in the new york state lottery!

1138
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:01,834
Are you serious?

1139
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:04,337
Yes! Right there
in the paper!

1140
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,338
Oh, Frankie!

1141
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,509
They laughed at
christopher columbus!

1142
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:11,511
They laughed at
the wright brothers!

1143
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:13,012
They laughed
at einstein!

1144
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,014
Mama, they even
laughed at me.

1145
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:16,816
But nobody's going
to laugh at me

1146
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,017
After christmas eve

1147
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,519
Because
i'm a finalist

1148
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:21,521
In the new york
state lottery,

1149
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:24,023
And i'm going to win
that $6.2 million,

1150
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,025
And i'm going
to spend it!

1151
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:27,326
And, honey, honey,

1152
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:29,028
I'm going to buy you
a beautiful home

1153
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,030
With a big lawn
for me.

1154
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:33,032
Frankie, don't worry
about a career,

1155
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,034
Not that you'll
ever get one anyway.

1156
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,702
Read it, kid.
Answer that.

1157
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:37,837
Who's on the phone?

1158
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:38,838
It's madeline.

1159
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:39,839
Madeline! Madeline!

1160
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:42,542
I'm going to buy you
a washer, a dryer,

1161
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:44,910
Every appliance
you ever hoped for.

1162
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,345
Then--

1163
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,081
She must have fainted.

1164
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,716
Celebration!

1165
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:51,717
Wine!

1166
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,719
And what about you,
detective pesce?

1167
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,721
What can I buy for you?

1168
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:57,723
Pop, can I talk to you?

1169
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:00,142
Not now. I'm busy spending
my money over here.

1170
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:01,644
Honey, listen to Frankie.

1171
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:04,146
Yes, my baby boy,
who bears my name?

1172
00:48:04,232 --> 00:48:05,648
That's exactly
the point, pop.

1173
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:06,649
Yeah? So?

1174
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:08,651
We both got
the same name.

1175
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:11,654
I know. It's my name.
I gave it to you.

1176
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:13,656
But it's my name
in the paper.

1177
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:16,158
What are you trying
to tell me, Frankie?

1178
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,660
Pop,
it's my ticket.

1179
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:19,662
What do you mean,
your ticket?

1180
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:20,830
I know. I know.

1181
00:48:20,915 --> 00:48:22,965
You don't think i'm going
to share it with you.

1182
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:24,967
Is that it,
you greedy bastard?

1183
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:28,337
It's my ticket. I'll buy you
whatever the hell you want.

1184
00:48:28,423 --> 00:48:30,840
You're a riot, kid.
You are absolutely a riot.

1185
00:48:30,925 --> 00:48:33,593
For a minute there,
you had me going.

1186
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:35,011
Salute!

1187
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:40,433
Ahh.

1188
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,741
What's going on?

1189
00:48:50,078 --> 00:48:53,579
Honey,
it's Frankie's ticket.

1190
00:48:53,648 --> 00:48:55,281
Yeah, pop.

1191
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,783
I went to irv's
to cash a check

1192
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,285
'cause the banks
were closed,

1193
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:01,203
And he made me
buy something.

1194
00:49:01,289 --> 00:49:02,622
So--so I bought

1195
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:04,256
Binoculars
and a ticket.

1196
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:08,260
You're telling me
you bought one ticket?

1197
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:10,262
I got 8 million tickets

1198
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:12,765
Sitting in
a shoe box upstairs,

1199
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,834
And you bought
one ticket.

1200
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:17,269
Yeah, well, pop,

1201
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:20,640
You know, I mean...
I'm lucky.

1202
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:39,191
Could I see
the ticket, Frankie?

1203
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:40,409
Yeah.

1204
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:01,564
You're going to win

1205
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:03,232
This miserable
fucking thing.

1206
00:50:03,317 --> 00:50:05,551
You know that,
don't you?

1207
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,553
Yeah, well, pop,
you know,

1208
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,388
What's mine
is yours.

1209
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,889
Yeah, likewise, Frankie.

1210
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:13,075
I got nothin'.

1211
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:27,623
Suddenly, everyone
was my best friend.

1212
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:28,958
Congratulations.

1213
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:31,377

Frankie pesce is a finalist
in the state lottery.

1221
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:50,479
Frank:
IT WAS REALLY RIDICULOUS.

1222
00:50:50,565 --> 00:50:52,481
I was 1 of 50 finalists.

1223
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,984
Everybody was acting like
I'd already won the thing.

1224
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,403
Would you bet on
a horse going for 50 to 1?

1225
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:58,654
I wouldn't.

1226
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,107
But my friends
were betting on me.

1227
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,326
Zippas was convinced
I could do anything.

1228
00:51:04,412 --> 00:51:06,245
So he took us down
to mulberry street

1229
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,780
To this real big
gambling joint

1230
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,381

1239
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:39,311
That's too fast,
baby.

1240
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:40,813
Place your bets!

1241
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:42,698
180 grab.

1242
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,117
A 9!

1243
00:51:49,123 --> 00:51:50,039
How you feel?

1244
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:51,657
I feel kinetic.

1245
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:54,326
Kinetic. I love that word.
I love that word.

1246
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,929
All right. We're
going to show them.

1247
00:51:56,997 --> 00:51:58,964
3 coming up.
Place your bets.

1248
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:01,100
100 says you don't
make that 9.

1249
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:02,184
Come on.

1250
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,719
All right.

1251
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,473
A 4!

1252
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,275
It's all right.
It's fine.

1253
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,442
Let's try
once again.

1254
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:12,695
400 on 9.

1255
00:52:13,614 --> 00:52:14,864
Come on,
Frankie boy.

1256
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:16,148
Take their money,
baby.

1257
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,149
Take their money.

1258
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,784
Come on! Come on!

1259
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,156
Hey, hey, hey.

1260
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:26,242
Ain't that louie tucci
over there?

1261
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:28,494
Don't offend him,
Frankie.

1262
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,963
He's got his own
graveyard in jersey.

1263
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,966
He'll cut your throat then
go out for calzone afterwards.

1264
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:35,968
He don't give a shit, man.

1265
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:37,970
Yeah, fuck him.
I have friends, too.

1266
00:52:38,038 --> 00:52:39,471
Hey, how you doing?

1267
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,973
Roll the fucking dice,
will ya?

1268
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,475
What's with this kid?
He got fucking palsy?

1269
00:52:43,544 --> 00:52:45,210
What, are you jerking
off? Let's go!

1270
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,545
Relax now,
Frankie.

1271
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,981
You can do it.
You can do it.

1272
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:50,816
All right.
Come on.

1273
00:52:50,885 --> 00:52:52,401
Ho!

1274
00:52:52,486 --> 00:52:53,402
A 9!

1275
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:54,403
Yeah!

1276
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:55,938
Right here!

1277
00:52:57,942 --> 00:52:59,892
Let him ride.

1278
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:01,393
Anybody got
any briasci?

1279
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:02,895
Fucking s.i.

1280
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,897
Fuck it up,
fat boy.

1281
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,699
Then it happened.

1282
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,200
I made history.

1283
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:10,202
I was about to do
something

1284
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:12,654
Nobody had ever seen
ever anywhere.

1285
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:15,174
Incredible.
You see this?

1286
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:17,042
Frankie, ba--

1287
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,271
Get that fucking kid
outta here.

1288
00:53:29,357 --> 00:53:31,557
Gimme an ax, i'll chop
your fucking hands off.

1289
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,525
Come on.
It's just a game.

1290
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:34,610
He was really upset.

1291
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:36,111
What are you looking at?

1292
00:53:36,197 --> 00:53:37,947
What, you think
this is a fucking joke?

1293
00:53:38,032 --> 00:53:38,948
Hey!

1294
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,532
I'm just
playing some dice.

1295
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:41,533
Come on.

1296
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:43,535
Come here,
you cock sucker.

1297
00:53:43,604 --> 00:53:44,536
Come on!

1298
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:45,537
Come here!

1299
00:53:45,606 --> 00:53:47,039
Fucking douche bag.

1300
00:53:47,107 --> 00:53:49,208
Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

1301
00:53:49,276 --> 00:53:52,544
Say good morning
to vinnie, dad.

1302
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:53,629
Ha ha ha.

1303
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:55,965
You think it's
a big joke, don't you?

1304
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:56,966
What?

1305
00:53:57,051 --> 00:53:59,835
Hanging out
with the mob guys

1306
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:01,420
And shooting dice, huh?

1307
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:02,922
What the hell are you
talking about?

1308
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:04,924
You're a legend
on mulberry street.

1309
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:07,309
Frankie fish's kid,
the man with the golden arm...

1310
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:09,428
You know, the golden arm
and head up his ass.

1311
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,597
Keep it up.
Watch what happens.

1312
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:14,132
Just relax, all right?

1313
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:15,517
I'm having fun.

1314
00:54:15,603 --> 00:54:17,019
It's just recreational.

1315
00:54:17,104 --> 00:54:18,487
Ok, sonny, ok.

1316
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,990
Don't get yourself killed
before the drawing.

1317
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:23,993
Then you can do
whatever the hell you want.

1318
00:54:24,078 --> 00:54:24,994
Great. Thank you.

1319
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:27,496
What the hell is
that smell in here?

1320
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:30,666
Smells like old gym
sneakers or something.

1321
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:36,655
It's pizza.

1322
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:38,507
That don't
look like

1323
00:54:38,592 --> 00:54:40,492
No pizza
I ever seen, pop.

1324
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:43,295
Just shut up
and have a slice.

1325
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:45,798
Did you make that?

1326
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,800
Did I make it? Do you see
your mother here?

1327
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:49,134
Yeah, I made it.

1328
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:52,137
It cost me a dollar
to make $1.00.

1329
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,355
The shit you buy--

1330
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:54,356
7 bucks.

1331
00:54:54,442 --> 00:54:56,608
Have a piece.
Come on.

1332
00:54:56,677 --> 00:54:58,360
Have a piece.

1333
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,403
The dough's a little hard.

1334
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:09,238
What's wrong?
What's the matter?

1335
00:55:09,323 --> 00:55:11,740
Pop, pop, you get
better pizza in korea.

1336
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:13,158
Who the hell made that,
michelin?

1337
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,994
Put it in the trunk
and use it as a spare.

1338
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:16,962
I'm going
to back to bed.

1339
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:18,363
That's the worst pizza

1340
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,999
I've ever had
in my life.

1341
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:23,552
The only member
of our family

1342
00:55:23,637 --> 00:55:25,054
To appreciate
my father's pizza

1343
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:26,338
Was vinnie.

1344
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,841
Obviously, my father's
not the kind of guy

1345
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,176
To sit around the house
like a normal person.

1346
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,479
The boredom
was driving him crazy.

1347
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:35,347
And remember,
the idle mind

1348
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:36,849
Is the devil's
playground,

1349
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,350
And in my father's case,

1350
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:41,653
It was about to become
an amusement park.

1351
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,776
Hey.

1352
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:51,447
Where the hell are
you three going, huh?

1353
00:55:51,532 --> 00:55:53,032
We're going bowling.

1354
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:54,867
That's right.
Bowling.

1355
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,504
Bowling, huh?

1356
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02,758
You haven't been bowling
since christ left chicago.

1357
00:56:02,843 --> 00:56:04,259
Well, maybe
we'll go bowling

1358
00:56:04,345 --> 00:56:05,761
And maybe we
won't go bowling.

1359
00:56:05,846 --> 00:56:06,962
Maybe we'll do
something else.

1360
00:56:07,048 --> 00:56:08,297
But I figured
it would be nice

1361
00:56:08,382 --> 00:56:10,299
For a father
to spend the evening

1362
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:11,934
With his sons.

1363
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:13,435
Got a problem
with that?

1364
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:16,472
You are
so full of shit.

1365
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,424
Ah, faccia due...

1366
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:20,926
I don't know.

1367
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:27,116
With dad out of work,

1368
00:56:27,201 --> 00:56:28,951
Our money situation
was getting worse and worse.

1369
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:31,070
The three of us decided
to get rid of the t-bird

1370
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:32,871
For the insurance money.

1371
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:37,576
Frankie, Frankie.

1372
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,577
What?

1373
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:40,579
Wait a minute.
Stand over there.

1374
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:41,630
What are you
talkin' about?

1375
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:42,948
Stand over there.

1376
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,883
Turn around.
Come on.

1377
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,971
Turn around.

1378
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:10,409
Let's go home.

1379
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,167
They found the car
completely untouched,

1380
00:57:18,252 --> 00:57:20,702
Except for the damage
my father had done,

1381
00:57:20,788 --> 00:57:23,505
Just where we left it
in the bronx.

1382
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:25,007
See, there are times

1383
00:57:25,092 --> 00:57:27,259
When you don't want
to be lucky,

1384
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,494
But that lucky star keeps on
shining no matter what.

1385
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,380
Bowling, huh?

1386
00:57:31,465 --> 00:57:35,434
♪ the best things
in life are free ♪

1387
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:38,503
♪ but you can give them
to the birds and bees ♪

1388
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:39,838
To make matters worse,

1389
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,340
We had a $500 deductible
on the car.

1390
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:44,342
A broken windshield
cost 380 bucks

1391
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:46,344
And 40 for the tow.

1392
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:48,346
Now we had
to pay 420 bucks

1393
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:51,650
To get the car back
in the shape it was.

1394
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:53,152
We don't--
we don't--

1395
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:56,071
We don't have $420!

1396
00:57:56,157 --> 00:57:57,489
Well, insurance
companies

1397
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,824
Are not in business
to be taken

1398
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,076
By stupid idiots
like you guys.

1399
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:02,661
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Idiots, huh?

1400
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,080
The car really did
get stolen in the bowlin' alley.

1401
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,583
I don't want
to get into it again.

1402
00:58:07,668 --> 00:58:10,335
Yeah, like
i'm 5'2" and blonde.

1403
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:13,305
The car didn't
get stolen

1404
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:14,673
Because
it's under his name.

1405
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:16,508
You know him with
that lucky curse,

1406
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,343
They'll find it no
matter where we hide it.

1407
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:19,645
This is
all your fault.

1408
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:21,563
You know what?
You're full of shit.

1409
00:58:21,649 --> 00:58:22,881
I'm full of shit?

1410
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:24,216
Where you going now?

1411
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,902
I got something
I got to do, all right?

1412
00:58:38,032 --> 00:58:40,949
I paid my cousin leo a visit
in budd lake, new jersey.

1413
00:58:41,035 --> 00:58:44,253
Together we figured out
a way to dump the car.

1414
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:47,256
Leo, you stinking crook,
get over here.

1415
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:48,757
Leo! What's the matter
with you?

1416
00:58:48,842 --> 00:58:50,759
You know, this stuff
really works.

1417
00:58:50,844 --> 00:58:52,628
Forget that shit.
Come here.

1418
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:54,880
Let me
ask you something.

1419
00:58:58,052 --> 00:58:59,184
♪ money ♪

1420
00:58:59,253 --> 00:59:00,919
♪ that's
what I want ♪

1421
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,221
♪ lots of money ♪

1422
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:03,388
Get in there!

1423
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,856
♪ that's
what I want ♪

1424
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:07,359
30 days later we were told
to go to the insurance company

1425
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:09,361
To pick up the check.

1426
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:11,530
The month had come and gone
and no one had found the car...

1427
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:13,398
As I was sure
would be the case.

1428
00:59:18,872 --> 00:59:21,790
Let's not look like 3
gaboons going in there.

1429
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,292
Who says we look
like gaboons?

1430
00:59:23,377 --> 00:59:25,744
We look like a family
gonna pick up a check.

1431
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:28,247
Look like a pack
of fucking wild dogs--

1432
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:30,249
That's what we look like.
I'm going in by myself.

1433
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:31,583
You wait out here.

1434
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,418
You don't want us
to come in?

1435
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,621
Frankie, tell him
what I said.

1436
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:39,124
I'm sorry, mr. Pesce,
but it seems

1437
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:42,511
That nobody's found
your son's car.

1438
00:59:44,732 --> 00:59:46,398
Aw, that's too bad.

1439
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:49,568
You know,
my son Frankie...

1440
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:51,937
He's been sick
for the whole month.

1441
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:54,990
You know what
he says to me?

1442
00:59:55,075 --> 00:59:59,278
He says, "daddy,
losing my car

1443
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,747
Is like losing
my brother."

1444
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:04,149
I mean, the kid's
heartbroken.

1445
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:05,317
Gee, you know,

1446
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,986
I feel terrible
about this.

1447
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,254
Listen...

1448
01:00:09,323 --> 01:00:11,156
Let me make
one more phone call.

1449
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,157
Oh, no, no--

1450
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,592
Maybe
we'll get lucky.

1451
01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:24,219
Yeah. Hi,
this is lucy sills.

1452
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:26,504
I was wondering if
there was anything

1453
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:28,673
New with case, uh...

1454
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:30,892
"102169."

1455
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:32,894
Thanks.

1456
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,529
They're checking.

1457
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:36,148
Yeah.

1458
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:39,034
What?

1459
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,987
Ivory gold mist?

1460
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,156
Uh, no, no. Aqua velva.

1461
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,240
Oh, no.

1462
01:00:45,326 --> 01:00:47,492
The car. Is it
ivory gold mist,

1463
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:49,628
A ford thunderbird,

1464
01:00:49,696 --> 01:00:51,496
License plates
"my way"?

1465
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,750
Yes. That's it.

1466
01:00:54,835 --> 01:00:56,752
Thank you.

1467
01:00:56,837 --> 01:00:57,869
Thank you.

1468
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:00,138
It seems they found
your son's car

1469
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:02,641
Over the weekend in
budd lake, new jersey.

1470
01:01:02,709 --> 01:01:06,428
Isn't that wonderful?
I'm so glad I checked.

1471
01:01:06,513 --> 01:01:08,146
Budd lake, new jersey?

1472
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:09,848
Budd lake.

1473
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,100
...bullshit me.
Automatic, my ass.

1474
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:14,152
Budd lake, new jersey?
Are you fucking crazy?

1475
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:15,604
What the hell
are you talking about?

1476
01:01:15,689 --> 01:01:16,938
They found the car

1477
01:01:17,024 --> 01:01:18,940
In budd fucking lake,
new jersey!

1478
01:01:19,026 --> 01:01:20,859
What a coincidence.
We got family there.

1479
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,327
I don't think
the insurance company's

1480
01:01:22,396 --> 01:01:24,329
Gonna put that together.
Who'd you go with,

1481
01:01:24,398 --> 01:01:26,782
Your cousin leo,
that fucking moron?

1482
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:29,167
You, come!
Drive the car!

1483
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:31,203
Drive the car!

1484
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:35,924
Shut the fuck up,
all right?

1485
01:01:36,009 --> 01:01:37,426
Get in the car!

1486
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:39,428
I'm getting
in the car.

1487
01:01:39,513 --> 01:01:42,931
I ended up selling
the car to my cousin leo.

1488
01:01:43,016 --> 01:01:45,634
2 days after the sale,
it got stolen.

1489
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:47,636
But that money
didn't last long.

1490
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:50,639
Now we were hitting
rock bottom.

1491
01:01:50,724 --> 01:01:52,474
Frankie,
give me the keys.

1492
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,476
Come on, car keys.
Give me the keys.

1493
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:55,811
I got to go out.

1494
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:56,945
Gimme the keys.
I need them.

1495
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,113
I'm going
to the garden.

1496
01:01:58,198 --> 01:01:59,281
Come on.
Come on.

1497
01:01:59,366 --> 01:02:01,032
Come. Come.
Come. Come.

1498
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:02,200
Got any money?
What?!

1499
01:02:02,269 --> 01:02:04,269
You got some money?
I need some money.

1500
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:05,270
Dad, not now.

1501
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,205
Frankie, look.
I'm way behind here.

1502
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:08,874
What do you got?

1503
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,876
I've got $400.

1504
01:02:10,944 --> 01:02:12,377
Go get it.

1505
01:02:12,446 --> 01:02:13,879
No, dad. What for?

1506
01:02:13,947 --> 01:02:15,881
Frankie, I got
a feeling tonight--

1507
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:17,299
I got a feeling

1508
01:02:17,384 --> 01:02:19,784
That I can't lose
on a fight tonight.

1509
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,303
Please.
You're my partner.

1510
01:02:21,388 --> 01:02:22,804
We'll be partners.

1511
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,306
Not again, dad.

1512
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:26,725
It's the first time
I ask for money--

1513
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:29,227
All right. I'm going
to get the money.

1514
01:02:29,296 --> 01:02:30,512
All right. Hurry up.

1515
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:32,130
Come on.

1516
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:35,016
Of course,
I got him the money.

1517
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:37,235
Frankie, it's
in the blue sock

1518
01:02:37,304 --> 01:02:40,689
On the left side
of the drawer.

1519
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:43,742
Believe it or not,

1520
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,777
My father actually
won on a fight.

1521
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:47,279
So I went down to the club

1522
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,830
To stop him before
he did any more damage.

1523
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:51,333
But philly said my father
doubled his money,

1524
01:02:51,418 --> 01:02:54,336
Took the 800 bucks,
put it on a horse.

1525
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:55,954
He got it up to 1,100

1526
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:58,006
And took off
like a bat out of hell

1527
01:02:58,091 --> 01:02:59,674
With johnny cake
and joe numbers,

1528
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,294
Saying something about
going to yonkers raceway.

1529
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:16,641
What are you doing?

1530
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:18,310
I'm waiting for you.

1531
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,062
Is your mother up?

1532
01:03:21,148 --> 01:03:22,514
Yeah. She's up.

1533
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:24,900
Aw, christ. I'm
getting out of here.

1534
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:26,568
Hey, what happened?

1535
01:03:26,653 --> 01:03:28,520
I lost 400.

1536
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:29,521
Good.

1537
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:32,824
Good. I was
really worried there.

1538
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,159
Listen, pop.

1539
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:37,879
Why don't you let me hold
the rest of the money?

1540
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:39,631
There's no money, Frank.

1541
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:42,534
I thought you said
you lost 400.

1542
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:45,637
Right. I lost
the 400 bucks.

1543
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:49,174
You had 1,100
when you left the club.

1544
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:50,675
Yeah, I did.

1545
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53,178
That means you've
got 700 on you now.

1546
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,897
No. I don't have
shit on me now.

1547
01:03:55,983 --> 01:03:58,099
How can you lose 400
out of 1,100

1548
01:03:58,185 --> 01:03:59,935
And not have anything
on you now?

1549
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,654
I lost the 400 bucks
you gave me.

1550
01:04:02,722 --> 01:04:05,323
You lost $1,100?

1551
01:04:05,392 --> 01:04:08,243
No. I lost the 400
you gave me.

1552
01:04:08,328 --> 01:04:09,744
Then where's
the other 700?

1553
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,112
It's gone.

1554
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:12,364
You lost it all.

1555
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:14,082
No.

1556
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:15,333
Yeah.

1557
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:17,285
Technically.

1558
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:18,336
Technically?

1559
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:20,255
What "technically"?

1560
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,907
You had 1,100
and now you don't have shit!

1561
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,577
That means
that you lost 1,100!

1562
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:27,245
I don't count
the other 700.

1563
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:29,080
Oh, you don't count it.
That money ain't real?

1564
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:30,582
It's no good?

1565
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:32,767
It doesn't pay the mortgage,
the gas, the electric.

1566
01:04:32,853 --> 01:04:35,270
Look, I don't count it
because it's their money.

1567
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:37,272
You see, I gambled
with their money.

1568
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:38,773
I lost your 400,

1569
01:04:38,859 --> 01:04:41,476
But their money
is their money.

1570
01:04:41,562 --> 01:04:44,896
You had their money
in your pocket, didn't you?

1571
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,115
Frankie...

1572
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,367
I'm out
of fucking work!

1573
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:53,104
What the hell
do you want from me?

1574
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:56,241
Besides, what the hell
are you worried about?

1575
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:57,609
You're going
to win the lottery

1576
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,944
And then hang out
on the street

1577
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:03,632
And be a jerk-off
for the rest of your life!

1578
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:07,636
How the hell do you know
i'm going to win that lottery?

1579
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:10,639
Even if I do, it's
not included in my plans

1580
01:05:10,724 --> 01:05:13,558
I'm going to hang out
on some street corner.

1581
01:05:13,627 --> 01:05:15,460
I'm going to do
something with my life.

1582
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:16,478
Yeah? Yeah, like what?

1583
01:05:16,563 --> 01:05:17,979
I don't know,

1584
01:05:18,065 --> 01:05:20,765
But i'm going
to get a real life.

1585
01:05:20,817 --> 01:05:22,267
And what am i?

1586
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:25,020
A fucking
cartoon character?

1587
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,490
Oh, shit.

1588
01:05:44,925 --> 01:05:47,125
F-Frank.

1589
01:05:49,296 --> 01:05:50,795
Frank.

1590
01:05:52,332 --> 01:05:56,635
I'm sorry what
I did to youse.

1591
01:05:56,687 --> 01:05:58,937
You listen to me,
Frank pesce.

1592
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:01,723
Listen to me good,
huh?

1593
01:06:01,808 --> 01:06:04,225
I don't want
to hear this shit.

1594
01:06:04,311 --> 01:06:07,228
Just don't you die
on me, you bastard.

1595
01:06:07,314 --> 01:06:09,280
That's all. Not now.

1596
01:06:09,316 --> 01:06:11,733
Ma, relax.

1597
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:14,536
You're not going
nowhere.

1598
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,872
You're going
to get well.

1599
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:20,875
You're going
to come home.

1600
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:22,627
I want the house

1601
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:24,546
To stink of them
rotten pizzas

1602
01:06:24,631 --> 01:06:25,997
You've been making.

1603
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:30,251
I want you to see
your son Frankie

1604
01:06:30,337 --> 01:06:32,671
Just make something
out of his life.

1605
01:06:32,723 --> 01:06:36,257
Do you think
I want to live till 106?

1606
01:06:36,343 --> 01:06:38,059
I'm not kidding,
Frank.

1607
01:06:38,145 --> 01:06:39,928
I'm not kidding.

1608
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:42,764
You and i,
we made a deal.

1609
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:44,899
We made a promise
to each other

1610
01:06:44,985 --> 01:06:48,319
To live together
happily ever after.

1611
01:06:48,388 --> 01:06:50,321
Antoinette?

1612
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:52,407
What?

1613
01:06:52,492 --> 01:06:54,225
Come here.

1614
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:55,527
Come here.

1615
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,373
What did he say, mama?

1616
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:12,877
He said, "keep the
cat off the lawn."

1617
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,183
Hey, pops.

1618
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:20,552
Be careful
with him, Frank.

1619
01:07:26,426 --> 01:07:28,059
You all right?

1620
01:07:31,698 --> 01:07:33,865
He looks good,
doesn't he?

1621
01:07:40,707 --> 01:07:42,624
He said
we ruined his lawn

1622
01:07:42,709 --> 01:07:44,125
While he was gone.

1623
01:07:44,211 --> 01:07:45,794
That's when I knew
he was all right.

1624
01:07:45,879 --> 01:07:48,079
He was back to
terrorizing everybody.

1625
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:52,667
I went for the first
available job I could find.

1626
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:54,169
And I got one

1627
01:07:54,254 --> 01:07:56,421
Over at sheldon toys
as a sales representative.

1628
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:58,289
Listen, i'm from
sheldon toy company.

1629
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:00,141
I got the greatest
little electric cars

1630
01:08:00,227 --> 01:08:02,560
You've ever seen.
These electric cars,

1631
01:08:02,629 --> 01:08:05,146
They're incredible.
The kids will go nuts.

1632
01:08:05,232 --> 01:08:07,131
You should order 20, 30
because the first day--

1633
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:09,317
Bang! They're out
the door. I'm serious.

1634
01:08:09,402 --> 01:08:11,569
I'm not kidding ya.
How many would you like?

1635
01:08:11,638 --> 01:08:14,155
♪ you'll look so good
that you'll be glad ♪

1636
01:08:14,241 --> 01:08:17,859
♪ you decided to smile ♪

1637
01:08:17,944 --> 01:08:21,162
♪ pick out
a pleasant outlook... ♪

1638
01:08:21,248 --> 01:08:24,833
It was the best job
I'd had yet.

1639
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:27,786
They even let me order
a company car.

1640
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:30,088
♪ slap on a happy grin ♪

1641
01:08:32,793 --> 01:08:33,792
What's this?

1642
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:35,210
It's my new car.

1643
01:08:35,295 --> 01:08:36,928
Yeah, white with
a white vinyl top?

1644
01:08:36,963 --> 01:08:38,463
It's a company car.

1645
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,465
You order a car for yourself,
you get the right color.

1646
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:42,801
Me and you go partners,
you get ivory gold fuckin' mist.

1647
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:45,103
Why not take it to budd lake
and show it to your cousin leo?

1648
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,055
Show him the car you shoulda
got the first time.

1649
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,640
This car better not be
under my fucking name

1650
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:50,141
With the insurance,
i'm warning you.

1651
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:51,509
Hey, vito...

1652
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,010
Looks good, don't it?

1653
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:55,513
Come here
and say that, you fuck.

1654
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:57,515
I'll give you
"looks good."

1655
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:59,651
Come here.

1656
01:09:01,037 --> 01:09:02,487
Then about a week ago,

1657
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:04,155
Jimmy vitello
said there was a guy

1658
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:06,524
Who was real interested
in meeting me.

1659
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,025
All jimmy would tell me

1660
01:09:08,078 --> 01:09:10,745
Was that it had something to do
with my lottery ticket.

1661
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,890
Hey, pesce!

1662
01:09:27,013 --> 01:09:28,980
Get in the car.

1663
01:09:29,048 --> 01:09:30,481
I'm going.
I'm going.

1664
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:32,183
Get in.

1665
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:35,987
Brr.

1666
01:09:36,055 --> 01:09:37,488
Ha ha ha ha.

1667
01:09:37,557 --> 01:09:38,489
You?

1668
01:09:38,558 --> 01:09:39,490
Yeah. Why,

1669
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:40,575
What's wrong
with me?

1670
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,610
Well, nothing. I mean...

1671
01:09:42,696 --> 01:09:45,496
Last time it looked like
you wanted to kill me.

1672
01:09:45,565 --> 01:09:47,498
Naw. That was
just that night.

1673
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:49,000
A lotta guys
get killed

1674
01:09:49,068 --> 01:09:51,002
Because people
are in bad moods.

1675
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:53,504
You're a legend down
on mulberry street,

1676
01:09:53,573 --> 01:09:54,622
You know that?

1677
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:56,407
What you did that night
with them dice

1678
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:57,959
And everything
else lucky

1679
01:09:58,044 --> 01:10:00,261
That's
happening to you.

1680
01:10:00,347 --> 01:10:02,580
Got the lottery
ticket on you?

1681
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:03,581
Yeah. Why?

1682
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:06,017
I might be interested
in buying it.

1683
01:10:06,085 --> 01:10:09,437
Well, it ain't
for sale, you know?

1684
01:10:09,522 --> 01:10:10,638
For 10,000?

1685
01:10:10,724 --> 01:10:13,141
You want to
give me 10 grand?

1686
01:10:13,226 --> 01:10:15,226
Ain't that
what I just said?

1687
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:16,811
Word is you got
a shot at this thing

1688
01:10:16,863 --> 01:10:17,979
With your luck
and all.

1689
01:10:18,064 --> 01:10:20,648
Maybe you do
and maybe you don't,

1690
01:10:20,734 --> 01:10:22,650
But if you want to sell
and do the right thing

1691
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:24,652
And keep it
in the family,

1692
01:10:24,738 --> 01:10:27,538
Remember, i'm with you
and you're with me,

1693
01:10:27,607 --> 01:10:29,774
And everybody's
with us, capisce?

1694
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:32,276
Hey, 2 minutes
I know you guys

1695
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,779
And already
i'm in the family.

1696
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:37,114
Well, you just
think about it.

1697
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,282
These things

1698
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,751
Have a way
of working out,

1699
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:41,970
And i'm
easy to find.

1700
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:44,722
I'm hungry.
Are you hungry?

1701
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,724
Yeah, i'm hungry.
You hungry?

1702
01:10:46,793 --> 01:10:48,125
Absolutely.
I'm hungry.

1703
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,594
Me, too.
I'm really hungry.

1704
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,846
Get the fuck
out of here.

1705
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:06,194
Frankie!

1706
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:07,195
Frankie!

1707
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,864
Frankie, come on,
wake up. Frankie!

1708
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,148
What?

1709
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:12,533
Wake up.
What?!

1710
01:11:12,619 --> 01:11:15,536
I really think i
nailed it this time.

1711
01:11:15,622 --> 01:11:18,155
Oh, no!
Get that out of here!

1712
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,657
Not this morning.

1713
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:24,161
Isn't it better,
what you're doing here--

1714
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:25,546
Staying at home,

1715
01:11:25,632 --> 01:11:27,548
Away from
these mob guys

1716
01:11:27,634 --> 01:11:29,050
And all
those hangouts?

1717
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:31,052
Watch, you'll amount
to something.

1718
01:11:31,137 --> 01:11:32,553
You keep your nose
to the grindstone,

1719
01:11:32,639 --> 01:11:33,888
And you're
gonna do better

1720
01:11:33,974 --> 01:11:35,306
Than that cop
upstairs.

1721
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:38,609
I never heard you talk
like this before, pop.

1722
01:11:38,678 --> 01:11:40,445
Sometimes it takes
something like this

1723
01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:42,113
To open your eyes.

1724
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:44,115
Frankie, I want to
ask you a question--

1725
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:45,616
When you win
the lottery,

1726
01:11:45,685 --> 01:11:47,452
You're not gonna
use that as an excuse

1727
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,786
To sit on your ass,
are ya?

1728
01:11:48,855 --> 01:11:51,622
I'll tell you
what I want to do.

1729
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:53,124
What?

1730
01:11:53,192 --> 01:11:55,209
Don't laugh,
all right?

1731
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:58,329
I'm not going
to laugh.

1732
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,167
I think i'm going
to go to college.

1733
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:04,469
How about that?

1734
01:12:04,537 --> 01:12:06,170
A college graduate
in the family.

1735
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,839
You could
be a doctor.

1736
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:10,558
Why don't you put
the cigarette out, huh?

1737
01:12:13,179 --> 01:12:14,145
She worries
about me.

1738
01:12:14,213 --> 01:12:15,646
No, no doctor.
What about a lawyer?

1739
01:12:15,715 --> 01:12:17,315
You be a lawyer.

1740
01:12:17,383 --> 01:12:19,517
Your brother can throw
everybody in jail,

1741
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,486
And you can get them all
back out in the street.

1742
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:23,354
Keep everybody busy.

1743
01:12:23,406 --> 01:12:26,074
Very funny.
Come on.

1744
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,576
First he'd have to
arrest someone.

1745
01:12:28,661 --> 01:12:31,412
If he can
find his gun.

1746
01:13:05,698 --> 01:13:05,763
That's culture, son.

1747
01:13:08,234 --> 01:13:10,118
I forgot
to tell you--

1748
01:13:10,203 --> 01:13:12,787
Jimmy vitello
called.

1749
01:13:12,872 --> 01:13:14,372
What did he want?

1750
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,374
Go down and see him.

1751
01:13:16,442 --> 01:13:19,127
Don't make him
feel bad, all right?

1752
01:13:19,212 --> 01:13:21,879
I got you, pop.
I got you.

1753
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:25,133
I'll see you, kid.
Have a good one.

1754
01:13:25,218 --> 01:13:26,801
All right,
pop.

1755
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:56,614
Get out of here.

1756
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,616
I love
you can still sing,

1757
01:13:58,668 --> 01:13:59,617
Real good.

1758
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:00,618
Come on.

1759
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,954
May I say something?

1760
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:05,957
Well, you know
I got a bad heart.

1761
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,626
I know you got
a bad heart.

1762
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,628
Well, uh,
you don't want to

1763
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,630
Break it, do you?

1764
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:14,132
Oh, Frank.

1765
01:14:14,184 --> 01:14:15,633
I would never--

1766
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:18,136
Wait a minute, now.
Wait a minute.

1767
01:14:18,188 --> 01:14:20,438
Wait, wait, wait.
Excuse me.

1768
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:23,141
You're crazy,
you know that?

1769
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:24,642
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1770
01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:26,561
Can I have
this dance?

1771
01:14:26,646 --> 01:14:28,813
It would be
my pleasure.

1772
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:33,951

To kill some time
before the drawing.

1778
01:15:07,353 --> 01:15:10,354
It was here that everything
started to fall apart.

1779
01:15:11,191 --> 01:15:12,607

01:15:46,092 --> 01:15:47,558
Where's
my hot cider?

1790
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:49,393
It's not hot yet.

1791
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:52,313
You'll let me know
before I die, huh?

1792
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:00,071
Where's Frank pesce?

1793
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:04,108
Uh-oh.

1794
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,910
Right here.

1795
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:09,630
Not you, scumbag.
Your father.

1796
01:16:09,716 --> 01:16:11,448
Hey. Hey, hey.

1797
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:12,950
Not in the club.

1798
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:15,219
Your old man owes my
uncle a lotta money.

1799
01:16:15,288 --> 01:16:16,620
I'm talking to you.
What are you, deaf?!

1800
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:18,556
What the hell are you
talkin' about? What money?

1801
01:16:18,624 --> 01:16:20,007
What money?

1802
01:16:20,093 --> 01:16:21,259
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1803
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,593
You scumbag!
Ho, ho, ho!

1804
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,129
What do you

1805
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:27,965
Your father been ducking us
for 3 fucking weeks.

1806
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,300
Not here.
Not in the club.

1807
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:30,301
You're fucking
with him,

1808
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:31,569
You're
fucking with me!

1809
01:16:31,637 --> 01:16:33,187
You don't have anything
to do with this, jimmy.

1810
01:16:33,273 --> 01:16:34,322
Bullshit, man!

1811
01:16:34,407 --> 01:16:35,823
You know why
we're here, philly.

1812
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:38,075
You want to start
a war over this?

1813
01:16:38,111 --> 01:16:40,644
You come in my club
at christmas eve

1814
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:42,646
And you start
this shit?

1815
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,081
Get out of here!

1816
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:45,700
We're coming
to your house tonight.

1817
01:16:45,785 --> 01:16:47,484
We're gonna give your
father a christmas present

1818
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:48,753
He'll never forget.

1819
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:50,871
Get the fuck
out of my club now.

1820
01:16:50,957 --> 01:16:53,841
Remember who you work for,
you fat fuck!

1821
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:55,659
Get out before I cut
your friggin' nuts off

1822
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:57,595
And have them
with my calimare!

1823
01:16:57,663 --> 01:17:00,848
What are you looking at,
you potato-nosed sucker?

1824
01:17:00,933 --> 01:17:03,467
He called me a fat fuck.

1825
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:05,469
Guys, go sit down.
Have fun.

1826
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:08,556
It's christmas eve.
Don, sing a song.

1827
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:10,691
Do you know anything
about this?

1828
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,312
Your old man's
into tucci for 10 grand.

1829
01:17:14,364 --> 01:17:15,846
10 grand?

1830
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:18,349
And he's 3 weeks
behind, all right?

1831
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:21,185
What is he, out
of his fucking mind?

1832
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:23,371
How can he be
3 weeks behind?

1833
01:17:23,456 --> 01:17:25,189
Hey, I don't sleep
with your father.

1834
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,457
How do I know?

1835
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:28,125
He's got a mortgage,
he's got bills.

1836
01:17:28,194 --> 01:17:30,461
He's losing
his ass here.

1837
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:31,962
Talk
to your old man.

1838
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,964
You got to help me.

1839
01:17:34,033 --> 01:17:35,132
I ain't getting
friggin' involved.

1840
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:37,534
I'll kill
that son of a bitch.

1841
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:39,203
Jimmy, come on,
you got to help me.

1842
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,138
Hey, I can't, Frank.

1843
01:17:41,207 --> 01:17:42,173
Why not?

1844
01:17:42,225 --> 01:17:44,058
I can't, man.

1845
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:49,847
Forget it. All right?

1846
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:50,898
Forget it.

1847
01:17:50,983 --> 01:17:52,566
Frankie, Frankie,
i--Frankie.

1848
01:17:58,557 --> 01:17:59,740
Fuck.

1849
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:26,600
Oh, thank god, Frankie.
What happened to you?

1850
01:18:26,686 --> 01:18:27,768
We're almost late.

1851
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:31,605
We got an hour and a half
to get to the garden.

1852
01:18:31,691 --> 01:18:33,641
I was scared stiff.
I thought you was hurt.

1853
01:18:33,726 --> 01:18:35,609
No. Everything's
fine, ma.

1854
01:18:35,695 --> 01:18:37,094
Where's dad?

1855
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,647
He--he's upstairs
getting dressed.

1856
01:18:39,732 --> 01:18:41,365
Something wrong?

1857
01:18:42,368 --> 01:18:43,617
No. Look...

1858
01:18:43,703 --> 01:18:45,703
I been thinking...

1859
01:18:47,206 --> 01:18:49,540
I think that I should go
to the drawing alone.

1860
01:18:49,608 --> 01:18:52,042
Are you crazy? He hears
that, he'll go nuts.

1861
01:18:52,111 --> 01:18:53,294
Frankie, we been

1862
01:18:53,379 --> 01:18:54,962
Looking forward
to tonight.

1863
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:56,297
I know, ma.

1864
01:18:56,382 --> 01:18:59,300
I bought a new dress,
for christ's sakes.

1865
01:18:59,385 --> 01:19:01,886
Frankie,
what is wrong?

1866
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:03,554
No, ma. I told you
everything's ok,

1867
01:19:03,622 --> 01:19:05,473
All right? I just been
thinkin' about it,

1868
01:19:05,558 --> 01:19:07,641
And I think I should go
to the drawing alone.

1869
01:19:07,727 --> 01:19:08,976
That's it, all right?

1870
01:19:09,061 --> 01:19:10,478
Wait a minute. Wait
a minute, wait a minute!

1871
01:19:10,563 --> 01:19:12,146
This is the biggest
night of your life,

1872
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:13,647
And you're going
to screw it up?

1873
01:19:13,733 --> 01:19:14,982
Shut the fuck up.

1874
01:19:15,067 --> 01:19:16,650
Don't tell me
to shut the fuck up!

1875
01:19:16,736 --> 01:19:20,321
Don't you guys ever
stop? What's going on?

1876
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:21,655
Frankie
don't want us

1877
01:19:21,741 --> 01:19:22,740
To go with him.

1878
01:19:22,775 --> 01:19:25,192
You don't
want us to go?

1879
01:19:25,278 --> 01:19:26,810
Just a thought I had, pop.

1880
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:28,112
Well, it's a bad thought.

1881
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:29,914
Get it out of your head.
Let's go. It's gettin' late.

1882
01:19:29,982 --> 01:19:32,116
No, pop. Forget it.
I'm going by myself.

1883
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:33,484
Come on,
Frankie.

1884
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:34,785
What is it?

1885
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:36,754
We put too much pressure
on you, am I right?

1886
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:38,956
You're afraid
if you don't win,

1887
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:41,325
We'll be disappointed in you?
Forget that shit.

1888
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:42,793
Let's just go
and enjoy ourselves.

1889
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:44,011
Whatever happens happens.

1890
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:46,630
No, pop. This is
what's going to happen.

1891
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:49,300
I'm going up to my room,
i'm getting my ticket,

1892
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:50,935
And i'm going by myself.

1893
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:53,170
Please
get out of my way.

1894
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:54,472
What's the hell's
wrong with you?

1895
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:55,973
You know what this
means to us.

1896
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:57,975
This is the most
important moment

1897
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,860
Of our lives,
for christ's sake.

1898
01:19:59,946 --> 01:20:02,363
No, pop,
it's not your moment.

1899
01:20:02,448 --> 01:20:03,864
It's my moment.

1900
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:05,366
You leave this house
without us,

1901
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:07,618
Win or lose,
don't come back.

1902
01:20:07,686 --> 01:20:09,320
With you setting
the example,

1903
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:11,322
I stand a good chance
of losing.

1904
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:12,623
What the fuck
did you say?

1905
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:13,657
You heard.

1906
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:14,658
Frank,
don't!

1907
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,877
Are you calling me
a loser?

1908
01:20:18,297 --> 01:20:19,497
I'm not a loser!

1909
01:20:19,549 --> 01:20:20,831
Have it your way, dad.

1910
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,166
I'm not a loser!

1911
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:23,534
All right!
You're a winner!

1912
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,302
Is that what you
want to hear,

1913
01:20:25,371 --> 01:20:26,470
You're a winner?

1914
01:20:26,539 --> 01:20:29,473
What the hell did you do
that was so great

1915
01:20:29,542 --> 01:20:31,425
Except gamble away
everything you ever owned,

1916
01:20:31,511 --> 01:20:33,427
Including
your own business.

1917
01:20:33,513 --> 01:20:34,595
I stayed.

1918
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,096
That's what I did.

1919
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:38,599
I stayed for 35 years.

1920
01:20:38,684 --> 01:20:42,102
I stayed and raised
a family for 35 years.

1921
01:20:42,188 --> 01:20:44,605
I did anything
I had to do

1922
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:46,857
To keep a roof
over our heads.

1923
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:49,610
That's what
the fuck I did!

1924
01:20:49,695 --> 01:20:51,111
You stayed, huh?

1925
01:20:51,197 --> 01:20:53,497
Big fucking deal.

1926
01:20:53,566 --> 01:20:55,616
You stayed? That's what
you're supposed to do.

1927
01:20:55,701 --> 01:20:57,618
It would be better
if you left

1928
01:20:57,703 --> 01:20:59,954
Rather than put up
with your shit my whole life!

1929
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:02,289
You squashed every dream I ever
had! It's not bad enough

1930
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:03,958
You pissed your own dreams
against the fuckin' wall--

1931
01:21:04,043 --> 01:21:05,759
You took me down with you!

1932
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:08,629
You don't know shit
about my dreams,

1933
01:21:08,714 --> 01:21:10,631
Not a fucking thing
about my dreams.

1934
01:21:10,716 --> 01:21:13,133
You think I gambled
my business away?

1935
01:21:13,219 --> 01:21:14,301
You don't know

1936
01:21:14,387 --> 01:21:16,136
What the fuck you're
talking about.

1937
01:21:16,222 --> 01:21:17,638
I loved my business.

1938
01:21:17,723 --> 01:21:21,141
It was the only thing
that I fucking owned!

1939
01:21:21,227 --> 01:21:23,227
I didn't gamble it away.

1940
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:25,112
They took it away!

1941
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:28,399
That's your fucking
big explanation?

1942
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:32,369
It's the same
old shit, dad.

1943
01:21:32,438 --> 01:21:34,572
You know something, son?

1944
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:37,941
We were doing
pretty damned good

1945
01:21:37,994 --> 01:21:39,443
Until you came along.

1946
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,945
You know,
I didn't want you.

1947
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:44,114
Your mother did,

1948
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:46,617
And she nearly died
having you,

1949
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:49,119
You sorry
son of a bitch,

1950
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:50,621
And I borrowed the money

1951
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:53,624
To keep you
and your mother alive.

1952
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:56,126
Keep your fucking hands
off me.

1953
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:58,629
I got down
on my fucking knees

1954
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:01,632
And begged louie tucci
to give me the money

1955
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:04,268
To pay off
the hospital bills,

1956
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,137
And when I couldn't
pay it back,

1957
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:11,775
He took control of
my company and my life!

1958
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:13,310
You get this straight,

1959
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:16,614
You ungrateful
son of a bitch,

1960
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:20,284
I am not a loser!

1961
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:23,487
You get your
fucking hands off me.

1962
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:24,988
I'm not a loser.

1963
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,257
I'm not a loser!

1964
01:22:27,326 --> 01:22:28,759
I'm not a loser!

1965
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:29,843
Oh, Frankie.

1966
01:22:29,929 --> 01:22:31,345
This ain't right,
Frank.

1967
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:34,098
I'm not a loser!

1968
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:38,135
I am not a fucking loser!

1969
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:39,970

I'm looking for tucci.
Do you know where he is?

1984
01:23:27,103 --> 01:23:28,235
No. He ain't here.

1985
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,687
Who the hell are you?

1986
01:23:29,739 --> 01:23:31,355
I work for him. Want to
see my fuckin' resume?

1987
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:33,741
I haven't got time
to screw around.

1988
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:37,077
You can't see him. Who
are you? Come over here.

1989
01:23:37,163 --> 01:23:38,579
Look, my name is Frank pesce.

1990
01:23:38,664 --> 01:23:41,248
Tucci wants to buy
a lottery ticket that I have.

1991
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:42,750
Couple weeks ago,
he offered me 10 grand.

1992
01:23:42,835 --> 01:23:44,251
Yeah, yeah, I know all
about that. Hurry up.

1993
01:23:44,336 --> 01:23:46,069
I'm freezing
my balls off.

1994
01:23:46,122 --> 01:23:47,921
I want to exchange
the ticket

1995
01:23:48,007 --> 01:23:49,590
For what
my father owes him.

1996
01:23:49,675 --> 01:23:53,677
But he's got to promise me
that he won't hurt him.

1997
01:23:55,681 --> 01:23:58,098
All right.
You wait here.

1998
01:23:58,184 --> 01:23:59,933
You wait right
here.

1999
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:30,581
All right.
It sounds fair.

2000
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:33,133
You got the ticket
on you?

2001
01:24:34,136 --> 01:24:35,803
Yeah. I got it.

2002
01:24:35,888 --> 01:24:37,838
Let's have it.

2003
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:44,645
Buon natale, kid.

2004
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:13,841
So that's that.

2005
01:25:15,494 --> 01:25:18,428
I guess tucci's
a very happy guy tonight

2006
01:25:18,497 --> 01:25:21,131
Because he won
6.2 million bucks.

2007
01:25:24,019 --> 01:25:26,136
But I saved my father.

2008
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:30,057
Hey, I had to do
what I had to do,

2009
01:25:30,142 --> 01:25:32,309
You know what I mean?

2010
01:25:35,648 --> 01:25:38,398
Then I went down
to the gordon,

2011
01:25:38,484 --> 01:25:40,150
Check the results.

2012
01:25:41,821 --> 01:25:43,904
Lucky me, huh?

2013
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:48,358
The rest you know.

2014
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:51,078
I went crazy
down at the church.

2015
01:25:51,163 --> 01:25:55,332
You guys picked me up
and you brought me here.

2016
01:25:56,669 --> 01:25:59,336
Do what you want with me.

2017
01:26:00,172 --> 01:26:02,089
I just want to go home

2018
01:26:02,174 --> 01:26:05,225
And make sure that
my father's all right.

2019
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,346
Go on home, boy.

2020
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:13,934
Let's forget
it ever happened.

2021
01:26:14,019 --> 01:26:14,935
Tolan.

2022
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,052
Yes, sir?

2023
01:26:16,105 --> 01:26:18,272
Give him a hand.
Take him home.

2024
01:26:18,357 --> 01:26:19,740
Anything else he needs.

2025
01:26:21,026 --> 01:26:22,192
Thanks, guys.

2026
01:26:25,164 --> 01:26:27,114
Frank...

2027
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,616
You're no mammalucco.

2028
01:26:29,702 --> 01:26:31,118
Thanks, sarge.

2029
01:26:31,203 --> 01:26:33,036
God bless, father lowery.

2030
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,158
Hey, Frank, want us
to walk you up?

2031
01:27:11,243 --> 01:27:13,410
No. I'll be all right.

2032
01:27:14,914 --> 01:27:16,163
Hey, Frank...

2033
01:27:16,248 --> 01:27:18,415
Merry christmas.

2034
01:27:18,467 --> 01:27:19,800
Thank you.

2035
01:28:13,939 --> 01:28:16,640
Hey, Frankie,
congratulations.

2036
01:28:16,692 --> 01:28:18,608
We heard about you
on tv.

2037
01:28:18,677 --> 01:28:20,694
This is my girlfriend
sheila.

2038
01:28:20,779 --> 01:28:23,697
She's been dying
to meet you, Frankie.

2039
01:28:23,782 --> 01:28:25,198
This is so great.

2040
01:28:25,284 --> 01:28:27,617
Oh, god bless you,
Frankie.

2041
01:28:27,686 --> 01:28:29,519
Mom, listen to me.

2042
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:31,021
Mom, we got problems.

2043
01:28:31,073 --> 01:28:33,023
I got to talk to dad.
Where is he?

2044
01:28:33,075 --> 01:28:35,042
He's in the kitchen.
He's making a pizza.

2045
01:28:35,127 --> 01:28:37,544
We're having a party.
Everybody's here.

2046
01:28:37,629 --> 01:28:38,545
Yay, Frankie!

2047
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:40,547
My hero is right here.

2048
01:28:40,632 --> 01:28:42,966
Yay!            yay!
Yay!

2049
01:28:46,872 --> 01:28:49,806
Ma, everybody's here.
Get rid of them.

2050
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:51,141
Of course they're here.

2051
01:28:51,209 --> 01:28:53,343
What's the matter
with you?

2052
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:08,158
I knew you were
gonna win!

2053
01:29:08,226 --> 01:29:11,161
The man of the hour
finally comes home!

2054
01:29:34,686 --> 01:29:36,436
Congratulations, son.

2055
01:29:37,523 --> 01:29:38,922
Yeah! All right!

2056
01:29:38,974 --> 01:29:39,923
Excuse me.

2057
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:40,924
Oh!

2058
01:29:40,976 --> 01:29:42,192
Excuse me.

2059
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,229
What the hell
are you doin' here?

2060
01:29:46,281 --> 01:29:47,697
I thought we
straightened this out.

2061
01:29:47,766 --> 01:29:48,782
I don't know

2062
01:29:48,867 --> 01:29:50,117
What the fuck you're
talking about.

2063
01:29:50,202 --> 01:29:52,619
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me here.

2064
01:29:52,704 --> 01:29:54,938
Can I say something
here, louie?

2065
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:56,773
I want everybody
to hear this.

2066
01:29:56,825 --> 01:30:00,127
Tucci, I can't borrow
money off you anymore.

2067
01:30:00,212 --> 01:30:02,462
You want to know why?

2068
01:30:02,548 --> 01:30:04,464
My son Frankie's
a millionaire,

2069
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:07,584
And he's choosy
who I borrow money from.

2070
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:10,087
There's something
I got to tell you.

2071
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:12,455
Frank, you're not going to
ruin my moment, are ya?

2072
01:30:12,508 --> 01:30:15,308
I've been waiting
my whole life for this.

2073
01:30:15,394 --> 01:30:16,843
I'd like
to say something.

2074
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,647
I said some bad things

2075
01:30:20,732 --> 01:30:23,567
To my son Frankie
earlier tonight,

2076
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:26,153
Things that
i'm sorry I said.

2077
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:29,156
Me and my kid,
we're big dreamers.

2078
01:30:29,241 --> 01:30:31,274
But my problem is

2079
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:35,195
That most of my dreams
didn't work out.

2080
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,831
And I think I stepped on
a lot of Frankie's dreams.

2081
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:39,833
You know,
you get a little older,

2082
01:30:39,918 --> 01:30:43,120
You get harder
and you get harder.

2083
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:45,672
Sometimes you forget
what's important.

2084
01:30:47,176 --> 01:30:48,675
But today...

2085
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:52,345
One of my dreams
came true.

2086
01:30:54,183 --> 01:30:58,001
I found out why my son
Frankie was born.

2087
01:30:58,053 --> 01:31:00,503
What is this,
a fucking christening?

2088
01:31:00,556 --> 01:31:02,472
Where's my money?

2089
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:03,890
Tucci...

2090
01:31:07,029 --> 01:31:09,029
You know what's in here?

2091
01:31:09,114 --> 01:31:10,530
Huh?

2092
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:13,483
$10,000.

2093
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:15,485
That's what I owe you.

2094
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:17,370
Vito, give it to tucci.

2095
01:31:17,456 --> 01:31:18,822
Give it to him. Go on.

2096
01:31:18,874 --> 01:31:20,490
No. You don't
owe him anything.

2097
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:22,876
Merry christmas,
pesce.

2098
01:31:22,961 --> 01:31:24,377
Likewise, louie.

2099
01:31:24,463 --> 01:31:25,579
What are you doing?

2100
01:31:25,664 --> 01:31:27,080
I owe him money.

2101
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:28,165
Hey, hey!

2102
01:31:28,217 --> 01:31:29,883
You can't take that!

2103
01:31:29,968 --> 01:31:31,534
I owe it to him.

2104
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:33,536
He can't take that money!

2105
01:31:33,589 --> 01:31:35,138
He can't take that money.

2106
01:31:35,207 --> 01:31:37,140
He loaned me the money.

2107
01:31:37,209 --> 01:31:39,392
I owed it to him.
I paid him.

2108
01:31:39,478 --> 01:31:40,644
Dad...

2109
01:31:42,347 --> 01:31:45,815
I heard that you
were in trouble.

2110
01:31:47,236 --> 01:31:50,187
So I gave tucci
the ticket.

2111
01:31:55,694 --> 01:31:58,028
You gave tucci
the ticket?

2112
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:01,364
I gave tucci the ticket.

2113
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:02,582
You gave him the ticket.

2114
01:32:02,668 --> 01:32:04,084
I gave him the ticket.

2115
01:32:04,169 --> 01:32:06,119
You didn't
give him the ticket.

2116
01:32:06,205 --> 01:32:08,288
Did you give him
the ticket?

2117
01:32:08,373 --> 01:32:09,789
Pop, for christ's sake,

2118
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:11,625
Don't do one of these
in front of everybody.

2119
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:14,127
I gave the ticket away
at the restaurant.

2120
01:32:14,213 --> 01:32:16,763
I gave it
to one of his goons.

2121
01:32:16,848 --> 01:32:19,766
I got a call
from philly the nap.

2122
01:32:19,851 --> 01:32:24,187
He told me what happened
at the club tonight.

2123
01:32:24,256 --> 01:32:25,639
You're my son.
I'm your father.

2124
01:32:25,724 --> 01:32:28,091
So I figured out
what you were going to do.

2125
01:32:28,143 --> 01:32:30,927
The guy you gave
the ticket to?

2126
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:32,229
Big friend of mine.

2127
01:32:32,281 --> 01:32:34,231
Frankie...

2128
01:32:36,151 --> 01:32:37,600
You gave the ticket...

2129
01:32:37,653 --> 01:32:39,869
Back to yourself.

2130
01:32:39,938 --> 01:32:41,938
What?

2131
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:43,406
We got it.

2132
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:44,908
We got it!

2133
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,109
You got the ticket?

2134
01:32:46,161 --> 01:32:47,277
We got it!

2135
01:32:47,329 --> 01:32:48,611
You got the ticket?

2136
01:32:48,664 --> 01:32:49,612
Right here!

2137
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:51,114
You got the ticket.

2138
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:53,216
He's got the ticket.

2139
01:32:59,224 --> 01:33:00,957
Where...

2140
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:02,759
Where'd you
get the money?

2141
01:33:02,811 --> 01:33:06,513
WHERE'D I GET THE MONEY,
THE 10 Gs? JIMMY V...

2142
01:33:08,066 --> 01:33:10,066
Am I good for the 10 g?

2143
01:33:10,135 --> 01:33:12,769
You got it, mr. Pesce.

2144
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:37,260
This one
you're going to love.

2145
01:33:37,329 --> 01:33:39,963
Oh, no.
I can't eat that.

2146
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:42,098
Come on.
Get in there.

2147
01:33:42,167 --> 01:33:44,100
Come on.
Have a piece.

2148
01:33:44,169 --> 01:33:45,435
No! No!

2149
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:51,107
Put her there.
God bless you.

2150
01:33:51,176 --> 01:33:53,276
Buon natale, kid.

2151
01:33:53,345 --> 01:33:54,611
You bastard.

2152
01:33:54,679 --> 01:33:58,315
What the hell did you say
to those guys in the car?

2153
01:33:58,367 --> 01:34:00,533
I wished them
a merry christmas.

2154
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:02,035
Ha ha ha!

2155
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,570
Thank you.

2156
01:34:25,811 --> 01:34:30,347
♪ peace on earth
and mercy mild ♪

2157
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:32,215
♪ god and sinners... ♪

2158
01:34:32,267 --> 01:34:33,650
Frankie.

2159
01:34:37,155 --> 01:34:39,022
Hey, pop.

2160
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:43,326
This is yours.

2161
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:49,366
Frankie...

2162
01:34:49,418 --> 01:34:52,869
Did you know the first
time I saw you,

2163
01:34:52,921 --> 01:34:54,587
You made me cry?

2164
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:01,428
What you did tonight
was great.

2165
01:35:01,513 --> 01:35:04,464
I want to thank you
for it.

2166
01:35:04,549 --> 01:35:06,466
It's just a good thing

2167
01:35:06,551 --> 01:35:08,468
That you're smarter
than me.

2168
01:35:08,553 --> 01:35:09,769
Uh-uh.

2169
01:35:09,855 --> 01:35:12,772
No, Frank, I ain't
smarter than you.

2170
01:35:12,858 --> 01:35:14,190
I'm just older.

2171
01:35:14,259 --> 01:35:16,259
You know you said

2172
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:19,562
Some beautiful things
in there tonight.

2173
01:35:24,703 --> 01:35:26,569
But would you finish...

2174
01:35:26,621 --> 01:35:30,290
Saying what you
started saying in there?

2175
01:35:30,375 --> 01:35:32,608
What?

2176
01:35:32,661 --> 01:35:34,294
You know.

2177
01:35:35,464 --> 01:35:37,914
About why I was born.

2178
01:35:47,642 --> 01:35:49,309
I don't know.

2179
01:35:50,645 --> 01:35:52,479
I don't know.

2180
01:35:52,564 --> 01:35:54,981
Why don't
you go out there

2181
01:35:55,066 --> 01:35:57,233
And find out
for yourself?

2182
01:36:06,828 --> 01:36:08,278
From time to time,

2183
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:11,281
I think back on rocky sav's
theory of life.

2184
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:15,285
You know--you're born,
you grow old, and you die.

2185
01:36:15,337 --> 01:36:18,288
Maybe that's all
there is to it,

2186
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,457
And we just keep
making it more complicated

2187
01:36:20,509 --> 01:36:22,792
Than we need to.

2188
01:36:22,844 --> 01:36:25,128
My father's gone now,

2189
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,130
But I remember
how years later

2190
01:36:27,182 --> 01:36:29,632
When we were up at
the new house on glencove,

2191
01:36:29,684 --> 01:36:32,185
Overlooking his new lawn
of kentucky bluegrass

2192
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:35,638
About half the size
of a football field,

2193
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:37,140
I said to him,

2194
01:36:37,192 --> 01:36:42,045
"I guess there's a happy
ending for us after all."

2195
01:36:42,113 --> 01:36:44,147
"Happy ending," he said.

2196
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:47,383
"I wouldn't have it
any other way."
