1
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,366
Where are they?
- They're on their way.

2
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:56,999
Hey, sweetheart.

3
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,411
If you don't like it there, just call.

4
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,788
Mom.

5
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,831
I can always come for you.

6
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,417
I'm not five anymore.

7
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,832
No.
- Maybe I won't come back at all.

8
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,826
Hey, cut it out.

9
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,707
Bye, Mommy-dear.
- Bye, sweetheart.

10
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,784
Have fun.
- Thanks.

11
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,040
Kimmie.
- Abby.

12
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,158
Sorry we're late.

13
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,656
Nice coat.

14
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,782
I slept at Casper's.
- Were you allowed to?

15
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,033
Yeah, duh, I was at Pippa's.

16
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,660
And, how was it?

17
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,659
Key to the house.
- Yes.

18
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,908
Hello. Everything okay?

19
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,282
We're taking the master bedroom.

20
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,833
Or shall I come after all?

21
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,826
No, it's a girls' weekend.

22
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,458
Plus one boy?

23
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,161
Oh-oh, that's going
to be three days of pining.

24
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,581
Feline.
- Hello.

25
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,035
Girls, I'm here.
- Pippa.

26
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,708
Party!

27
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,331
Had fun staying over
at my place?

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,333
Hey.
- Hi.

29
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,165
How cute, he's shy.

30
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,407
Okay, photo.

31
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,202
Do you have the bread?

32
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,782
Oh shit, completely forgot about that.

33
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,284
But this is grain too.

34
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,160
Sorry, Casper,
she's ours now.

35
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,655
No.

36
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,907
Sweet. He'll only think of you
for the next three days.

37
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,663
Bye.

38
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,783
Hey, is this going to work out?
- Yes.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,326
Sure? Keys?
- Yes, will you call me?

40
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,784
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

41
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,542
Rpadtrip.
- Yup.

42
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,079
Welcome at Pippa Tours.

43
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,782
Specialized in girlfriend trips
just before exam stress begins.

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,785
Don't talk about school, please.

45
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,784
With all the luxuries...
- And booze!

46
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,784
for your exam stress.

47
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,661
Our drive to the Ardennes
will take exactly...

48
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,786
♫ Tonight.

49
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,574
♫ We are young

50
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,790
♫ So let's set the world pn fire

51
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,705
♫ We can burn brighter

52
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,788
♫ Than the sun

53
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,039
♫ Tonight

54
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,448
Pippa.

55
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,450
Who's that new lover of yours?
- Hello, private.

56
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,414
Girls, put your phones away.
Let's play a game.

57
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,667
Yes, okay. I spy with my little eye
and it is...

58
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,908
the sex alphabet game.

59
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,290
Anus, boner, clitoris...

60
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,829
No, you have to mention all the boys

61
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,289
you've French-kissed or slept with.

62
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,783
Well, let's have that sex game of yours.
- Okay.

63
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,033
Well, the A of Alex.

64
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,159
And Mr. Arends, of course.

65
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,454
Is that the..

66
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,700
The hot gym teacher at my old school.

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,036
That's why I'm with you guys now.

68
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,329
Okay, I've got an Abel.

69
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,658
Achmed.
Oh, and Antoine.

70
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,825
I see. International.

71
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,578
Kim?
- I don't have an A.

72
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,954
Kim?
- Okay, B.

73
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,157
Bram.

74
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,034
Boudewijn.
- Ben.

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,031
Oh, and a Bruce.

76
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,917
Feline, you slut.
- I had no idea.

77
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,035
This all happened on vacation.
- Oh, vacation.

78
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,579
I don't have a B either.
- Casper.

79
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,333
And Cees.
- Ouch, I have a Cees as well.

80
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,705
Pippa, do you also have a Cees?

81
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,792
No, but I do have a Cornelis.

82
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,203
And I think I'm forgetting one.

83
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,952
Oh no.

84
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,330
Not Christiaansen from German.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,873
Kim?
- Christoph.

86
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,833
Did you have sex with him?
- No.

87
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:32,665
I thought you didn't want to because...
- He had a really big one.

88
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,785
A porn prick. A super schlung.

89
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,533
But seriously, Kimmy, that's beautiful.
Waiting for Mr. Right.

90
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,166
So romantic.

91
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,290
<i>Despite the calm weather,
we warn you for wintry conditions.</i>

92
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,829
<i>Especially the Ardennes will be hit</i>

93
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,331
<i>with heavy snow and wind.
Be careful if you have to drive.</i>

94
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,534
We can fill her up there.
- Oh, yes...

95
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,948
Are you sure?
- Be careful!

96
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,910
Can't you watch out?

97
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,667
Hi.

98
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,031
Ab.
- Abby, will you give me a hand?

99
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,780
I'll be right there, okay?
- Yes.

100
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,036
Shit.

101
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,913
Let's check inside.

102
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,948
Hello?

103
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,542
Be right back.

104
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,328
Fuck.

105
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,327
Feline?

106
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,908
Feline, this is not funny.

107
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,666
Cool, right?
- No.

108
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,081
You're terrible.
- This is fantastic.

109
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,790
I don't know if she agrees.
- Otherwise just pay with your credit card.

110
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,033
Very funny
- Huh?

111
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,199
The light.

112
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,410
I was out here. Come.

113
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,827
Hey, did you find it?
- Creep fest in there.

114
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
Did we pay?
- There's no one here.

115
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,417
Come.

116
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,542
Sprry.

117
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,707
Here.

118
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,789
Bully.
- Bully, here.

119
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,538
Awful man.

120
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,666
What a creep.
- Yes.

121
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,660
He wanted you to stay
and give him a good time.

122
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,916
That old geezer must be experienced.

123
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,539
Yes, and you like older men, don't you?

124
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,416
You go, Kimster.

125
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,408
To the right,
to the right!

126
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,621
What the fuck.

127
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,950
Dude, what are you doing?

128
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,161
Daan.

129
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,542
Hey, the highway hooligan.
Are you staying here as well?

130
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,414
Yes, a bit further up the road.

131
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,036
We're having a girls' weekend.

132
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,663
That's fun. All weekend?

133
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,451
Hey, do you guys have any bread?

134
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,449
Yes.

135
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:45,157
We're having cheese fondue tonight,
but we forgot the bread.

136
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,580
We can bring some bread along.
- Okay.

137
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,665
If we can join you.
- Around eight? The house down there.

138
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,788
Yes, perfect.
- But without the rifle.

139
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,326
We don't like hunting.
- Okay.

140
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,540
Wasn't it a girls' weekend?
Why invite boys over right away?

141
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,574
Is that a problem
for a man-eater like you?

142
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,208
We don't even know these guys.

143
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,030
They weren't creeps, were they?
And now we have bread.

144
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,541
Yes, and not enough cheese fondue.
- Shall I cancel them? Do you want me to?

145
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,788
Yes, this is our last trip together
before our finals.

146
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,574
We'll enjoy one evening with them
and then it'll just be the four of us.

147
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,663
And Pippa won't take such decisions
by herself anymore.

148
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:52,163
No, I solemnly swear I'll never let
any creepy boys into our home again.

149
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,577
Promise.

150
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,833
With the shutters open
it's really cozy.

151
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:30,916
Come.

152
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,038
Hello, are you coming?
- Yes.

153
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,282
Isn't the view phenomenal?

154
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,413
Ta-da!

155
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,281
Casper said something...

156
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,908
Wow, this is creepy. Look here.
- It just needs to get heated up.

157
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,081
Het moet gewoon even ppwarmen.

158
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,241
Did Casper shoot that?
- No.

159
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,657
It's mainly his father who hunts.
You know that.

160
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,955
Have you guys been here before?
- Yes, with Casper.

161
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,042
You?
- Casper used to live next door.

162
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,202
So I came along once.
- Without your parents?

163
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,825
My parents were in a sort of crisis,
so they sent me...

164
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,324
On a sleepover?
- Yes.

165
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,663
I've been there.

166
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,074
Yes, this room is super chill.

167
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,041
We're sleeping here. Come.

168
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,908
Sorry.
- Bye.

169
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,207
You want top or bottom?

170
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,538
You choose.
- Okay.

171
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,157
I was going to sleep with Kim.

172
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,954
Okay, sorry.

173
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,538
I just thought, since we'll be
travelling together...

174
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,458
It's not that I really promised her.

175
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,908
No, but I understand.
You've been friends a long time.

176
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,163
I've shared rooms with her so often...

177
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,535
Are you sure?

178
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,331
I'm so excited to stay here with you.

179
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,541
Now you have three days
to find out if I snore and stuff.

180
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,458
I'm really not sure if I can do it.

181
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,157
We always said the three of us were
going to study in Groningen together.

182
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,163
I just think it'll be great with you.

183
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,790
Who is 'Ghost'?

184
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,907
Your father.

185
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,956
Okay? I'll be right back.

186
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,538
What do you think
'no contact whatsoever' means?

187
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,698
Occupied.

188
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,033
Not all the way.
Leave it ajar.

189
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,663
Okay. Freaky.

190
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,075
Yes, but you already knew.

191
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,036
We discussed that.
Yes, we did.

192
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,284
No, not at all.

193
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,910
Yes, of course. Goddammit.

194
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,655
Pippa thinks I'm freaky
for leaving the door ajar.

195
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,783
I mean, she's really okay,
but sometimes...

196
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,663
Because she shares a room with Abby?
- She also does it with you, doesn't she?

197
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,157
In the car with those guys,
inviting them?

198
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,574
You didn't want that, did you?

199
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,163
But you all did, so...

200
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,079
I'm going to cook.

201
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,536
Fuck.

202
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,032
Kim.

203
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:33,663
I didn't dare say no.
- We had an agreement.

204
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,281
Yes, I know, sorry, I...

205
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,541
Pippa just really wanted it. It's the
first time she's coming with us, so...

206
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,535
I don't want her to feel left out.

207
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,282
The next time we'll share
a room again, okay?

208
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,952
What was it like with Casper?

209
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,660
Fantastic.

210
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,580
I expected more from it.

211
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,031
Like what?

212
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:08,530
You know, bells and whistles
and explosions and fireworks.

213
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,451
Sounds like a New Year's Eve party.

214
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,285
Yes, with Pop Tarts.

215
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,291
Fruitcake.
- You're a fruitcake.

216
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,240
Better a fruitcake than a tart.

217
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,906
Love you.

218
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,454
Sorry. For not being there for you
in the car.

219
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,453
It's okay.

220
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,157
Really.

221
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,542
Pippa is just Pippa, she always
shoots her mouth.

222
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,157
Don't take it personally.

223
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,911
Why didn't you want those boys
to come over?

224
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,541
I wanted to talk about something,
with you guys.

225
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,160
You still can, right?

226
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,164
Gee, great fun.

227
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,327
So cold.

228
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,532
Hi.
- Hi.

229
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,160
Can I join in the laughter?

230
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,041
No.
- Why not?

231
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,450
Because of you we're short
on cheese fondue.

232
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,792
Problem solved.

233
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,203
Well...

234
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,328
What?

235
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,913
Should I text Casper about the boys?

236
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,407
No, of course not. Who cares?

237
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,664
What happens in the Ardennes
stays in the Ardennes.

238
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,823
Very good.
- Exactly.

239
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,158
That's it.
- Right.

240
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,040
I'll get it.

241
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,409
Hi.
- Hi, hello.

242
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,664
Hoi.
- Hoi.

243
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,659
I said without the rifle.

244
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:23,916
Yes, sorry. That's against
Belgian serial killers.

245
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,916
Put that away.

246
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,575
Did it scare you?
- Kim is very sensitive.

247
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,324
Sorry, we thought it was funny.

248
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,958
Are you okay?
- Yes.

249
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,079
Shots?
- Yes, please.

250
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,035
Nice that you're here, guys.
- Cheers.

251
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,708
Cheers.

252
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,076
So how do you all know each other?

253
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,957
Abby and I from primary school,

254
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,291
Feline and I from hockey camp
and then also primary school.

255
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,913
That's a long time.
- Yes, very long.

256
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:18,573
And next year we're going
to Groningen together.

257
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,908
Boring. No way I'm going to university
straight away.

258
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,786
First some traveling.
Hop on a plane with my backpack and just...

259
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,913
go.

260
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:29,201
No hassle, no parents, no school.
- Exactly.

261
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,782
Right? Best way to get to know yourself.

262
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,788
Right?
- Yes, sounds cool to me too.

263
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,369
I also went straight to university.
Nothing wrong with that.

264
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,328
Cheers.
- Cheers

265
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,290
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

266
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,414
Can you manage?
- Yes.

267
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,074
I'm into football.
- Seriously?

268
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,325
What's your club?
- Ajax, of course.

269
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,824
Really? Sick.
- Mokum rules.

270
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,538
Born and raised.
- Amsterdam?

271
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,657
Yes.

272
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,203
I thought you looked familiar.

273
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,289
Didn't you go to Berlage,
with Marjolein Heemstra?

274
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,324
Doesn't ring a bell.
- She's my sister.

275
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,203
Never heard that name.

276
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,405
You were expelled, weren't you?
- She can't tell.

277
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:08,783
Because of Mr. Arends, the gym teacher.

278
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,910
You want his number, Kimmie?

279
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,331
He was a fantastic lover.
Nice for your first time.

280
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,540
That's not what I meant.

281
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,789
That girl's name was Naomi.

282
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,325
It had to do with bullying, not...

283
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,042
Sex.

284
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,792
Nice.

285
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,656
This will be my first night
sleeping here. With Pippa.

286
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,581
When I was here with Casper...

287
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,577
I had to sleep in the bunk bed
and he on the couch.

288
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,829
Then Pippa's a lucky girl.

289
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,406
You're crazy.

290
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,822
I'm lucky with a boyfriend
with such a nice place.

291
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,244
Kimmie.

292
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,332
Com on.
- I can't dance.

293
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,789
Everyone can dance.
- Really, I can't dance.

294
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,917
Kim and Daan.

295
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,916
Fuck.

296
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,910
Bitch.

297
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,708
I'll have a look.

298
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,535
Good job, tiger.

299
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,948
Alcohol.

300
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,288
Yes.

301
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,822
We've been together six months today.

302
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,040
But he hasn't texted me yet.

303
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,909
It's only 12.30, though.
- But Casper is super attentive.

304
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:25,906
Maybe he's asleep.
Or he went into town.

305
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,826
Why don't you send him a message?
- I already did.

306
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,916
Four times already.

307
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,157
I clearly need your advice.

308
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,327
Well, first of all...

309
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,160
no more texting.

310
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,948
And second?

311
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,201
Don't think so much.

312
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,699
Hello?

313
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,035
Hello?

314
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,079
Hello?

315
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,079
I'm thirsty.

316
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,280
You?

317
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,667
Abby.

318
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,577
Abby.

319
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,039
Abby.
- Kim?

320
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,292
What's the matter?
- Kim?

321
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,155
I was locked in
and there's someone outside.

322
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,621
Easy.
- There's someone outside. A man.

323
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,783
Maybe it was Daan,
he's outside.

324
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,038
I'll check.

325
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,533
I'm sure. It's a man.

326
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,451
Easy.

327
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,791
Kim, Kim...

328
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,536
There's no one there, Kim, really.

329
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,697
We're here, okay?
Calm down.

330
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:45,956
I didn't see anyone. Daan went first,
he didn't see anyone either.

331
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:50,158
Are you ready to go?
- You're not leaving already, are you?

332
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,330
Is everything okay up there?
- Pippa?

333
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,542
Yes?

334
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,456
Did you lock Kim into the bathroom?

335
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,542
You went to check up on her
and suddenly the door was locked.

336
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,202
What a sick joke.

337
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:12,917
Kim is claustrophobic and you
knew she wanted the door ajar.

338
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,790
Are you new BFFs now?

339
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,292
Or would you rather sleep
in between Abby and me tonight?

340
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,198
I don't do it with phony
hetero girls, capisce?

341
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,076
Please don't go.

342
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,536
She's in bed.
- Is she doing okay?

343
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,666
Is the party over?
- Absolutely not.

344
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,783
But maybe you can convince
those three here.

345
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,202
Cheers.
- Prosit.

346
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,823
Are you scared?

347
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,785
Feline, look.

348
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,948
Abby, do you know where Feline is?

349
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,908
Hello, we're still sleeping.

350
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,915
She's downstairs.

351
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,405
Will you let Bully out
while you're at it?

352
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,916
Be quick, Bully.

353
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,292
Feline?

354
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,583
Feline?

355
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,034
Feline?

356
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,542
Feline.

357
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,202
Bully, come.

358
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,659
Bully.

359
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,660
Bully.

360
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,202
Bully.

361
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,910
I can't find Feline.
She's gone.

362
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,791
Bully, cut it out.

363
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,034
She's gone. The door was open.
There's someone outside.

364
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,667
A creepy man?

365
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,038
Of course not.

366
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,913
Isn't she just outside?
- I looked outside.

367
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,655
We'll just call her.

368
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:46,080
I know where she is.
- No signal.

369
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,531
Duh, with those guys.

370
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:51,538
She wasn't into them at all.

371
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,032
My dear, while you were
making out with Daan,

372
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:57,160
she was comforting Stijn.

373
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,995
So you saw her leave? With Stijn?

374
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,031
I don't remember them
leaving at all. You?

375
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,531
Let's go and get her, then.
- And then?

376
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,702
I don't think she'll find it chill
if we drag her out of Stijn's bed.

377
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:17,413
She'll come back
once it stops snowing.

378
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,908
And when we have a signal again
we'll just call her.

379
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,164
It's not as if she
went out by herself.

380
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,657
We have to do something.
- Pippa's right.

381
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:29,780
Feline won't find it chill if we
pop up there all of a sudden.

382
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:51,907
Are you mad because we won't go
or because she's with Stijn?

383
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,200
Is Pippa coming to help or what?

384
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,657
What do you have against her?

385
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,576
You act weird when she's there.
- You act weird.

386
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,908
Ever since we got here.

387
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,451
What was that about in the bathroom?

388
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,706
I really thought I saw someone.

389
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,201
Is it because of the house?

390
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,456
It's possible, with all
those dead animals.

391
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,659
Pippa locked me in.

392
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,329
She's really not as cool as you think.

393
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,325
You're not as nice when she's around.

394
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:33,782
Sorry.

395
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,158
Me too.

396
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,658
Help, I'm Feline's ghost.

397
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,831
Oh, not funny, right?

398
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:53,781
Look here, croissants.
They were still in the car.

399
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:58,958
Okay, just have a seat, girls.
Momma Pippa will take care of you.

400
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,166
Would you care for a beverage?

401
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:09,036
Cappuccino, please.
And hurry up.

402
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:13,666
I'll have hot cocoa with whipped cream.
- Coming up.

403
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,791
I still have no signal. You?
- No, neither do I.

404
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:47,663
Maybe we should better go.
- Without Feline?

405
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,660
No way.

406
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,033
What if we get snowed in?

407
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,785
That SUV is a four-wheel drive.

408
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,040
You miss Casper, don't you?

409
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,915
No, I just have a mega hangover.

410
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,829
Me too.

411
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:12,331
At least you puked all over Daan.
- No, I did not.

412
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:15,915
Maybe you should have.
Gee, what a creep.

413
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,166
Come on, grannies,
let's do something fun.

414
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,406
Come, Kimmie.

415
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:30,079
A private sauna is really chill.
No Peeping Toms.

416
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,949
Centre Parcs.
- That was so terrible.

417
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:36,030
There was this hairy gorilla

418
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,200
who kept sliding onto Kim's towel.

419
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:42,405
Yuck.
- Yes, and he kept going: 'Ohh...'

420
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,033
So Kimmie, you can stand
being in a sauna.

421
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,536
While the bathroom room
must stay ajar.

422
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:58,833
Yes, the sauna's bigger.
- Does it involve exact measures?

423
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:02,705
No. It's also because you guys are here.

424
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:06,704
But the door's still closed, isn't it?
- I find it scarier by myself.

425
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,041
What a hassle.

426
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,822
Hey, are you okay?

427
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,788
Yes.

428
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:27,281
Hey, you and Casper six months today.
Awesome.

429
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:28,833
Yes, it really is.

430
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,078
Sorry.

431
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,455
That's not how I meant it.
- Maybe...

432
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:40,163
you should just stay quiet, Kim.

433
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:06,666
Abby, you can't hold her hand forever.

434
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,207
This is how it always goes.

435
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,164
You won't be there
for her next year either.

436
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,541
I feel like a selfish bitch
for abandoning her.

437
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:21,286
Kim is pretty manipulative
with that sensitivity of hers.

438
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:26,915
And I don't think you're a selfish bitch.
- But I am.

439
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,789
I kissed Jeroen.

440
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:38,910
I understand that.

441
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:42,583
Yes, there was a total zing
between you guys.

442
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,283
Still, I shouldn't have done it.

443
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:50,454
You're not a dried-up old plum.

444
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,581
And you really enjoyed it, didn't you?

445
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,409
It's not fair to Casper.

446
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,541
Except he's not calling back.

447
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,077
Maybe he can't reach us.

448
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,917
He was going to call yesterday,
when we still had service.

449
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,532
Don't let him tie you down.

450
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:21,406
Especially not if he doesn't
call back. That sucks.

451
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,409
Thank you.

452
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:31,448
I could never have told Kim,
she'd be in total shock.

453
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,660
Thanks.

454
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,655
What's the matter?
- I saw something there.

455
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,786
Are you starting as well?
- No, really, I saw something.

456
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,785
Where?

457
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,666
That's cheating.

458
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,283
I just went to take Bully out.
- Sorry.

459
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,541
For being so nasty to you before.

460
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:41,750
I'm just worried about Casper.

461
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:48,081
Where's Pippa?
- She went back into the sauna.

462
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,284
It's true.

463
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,331
Pippa's real first name is Naomi.

464
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,532
Did you go through her things?
- Yes, sorry, but just look.

465
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,783
She was expelled because of bullying.

466
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,039
You can't just go
through her things, Kim.

467
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,911
She's not who she says she is.

468
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:09,786
This is just what she said about you.

469
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,539
That you're jealous of our friendship.
- Abby.

470
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:14,285
Grow up.

471
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,160
Abby.

472
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,032
Casper?

473
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,288
Look.
- Get lost, Kim.

474
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,828
Abby.

475
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,792
Get a life.

476
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:29,958
Abby?

477
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,666
Fuck... Hello?

478
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:19,035
You bitch, what a sick joke.

479
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,578
Take it easy.
- Bitch.

480
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:23,288
I could have died in there.
Did you consider that?

481
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,663
No.
- Pippa.

482
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:27,039
What? She locked me up
in the sauna.

483
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:28,916
That can't be, we were here.

484
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,910
Oh, then who was it?
And don't start about your ghost.

485
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:34,573
It wasn't me. There's someone
here, I told you.

486
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,329
Bullshit, psycho bitch.
- You are a psycho bitch.

487
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,160
Okay, enough.

488
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,699
You're driving me insane.
Let's go home.

489
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,452
Yes, let's.

490
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,908
But I'm leaving you behind, freak.

491
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:24,792
Where's my phone?

492
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:30,781
Pippa.

493
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,163
Abby.

494
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:35,655
Feline didn't go with the boys.

495
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,198
Where's my fur coat?

496
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:43,907
Look. She wanted to tell us
she's lesbian.

497
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,164
Pippa's lying.
She's not with Stijn.

498
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,167
Why would she lie about that?
- To fuck with me.

499
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:52,041
Because I fancy Stijn.

500
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,289
Don't you see? She's been
doing that the whole time.

501
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,539
Pippa saw these pictures.
- So?

502
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,783
So she knew about Feline.

503
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,783
And she still came up
with that story.

504
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,833
Now Feline's gone
and we haven't even looked.

505
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,163
Did you lock Pippa up?

506
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:12,205
Wow, Pippa's really brainwashed you.

507
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:15,202
But that wonderful Pippa of yours,
or Naomi...

508
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,285
Pippa.

509
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:46,532
Open the door.

510
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,155
Let me in.

511
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,325
Pippa, come on.
- What are you doing?

512
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:54,828
Let me in, Pippa.

513
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:00,910
Wait.

514
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:55,790
Look what you did.
My parents will kill me.

515
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,957
I have to get out of here now.
- Let's go to the boys.

516
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:02,160
Without a car? We'll go
to the village, bitch.

517
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,167
That's too far.

518
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:08,156
Come.

519
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:35,914
He was only six months old.

520
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,077
Who would do something like that?

521
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,664
There are no wolves here, are there?

522
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,916
Left or right?

523
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:12,906
Left?

524
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,456
We must be nearly there.

525
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:32,578
Where's their car?
- Fuck.

526
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,785
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

527
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,457
Where are they?
- Duh, gone.

528
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,280
What about Feline?
- We're fucked.

529
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,913
Run, it's that man!

530
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:21,917
It's him! He killed Bully.
And Feline.

531
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,408
We have to stay together.

532
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:26,409
Can you give me a hand?

533
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:43,158
If you hadn't lied about Feline
taking off with the boys,

534
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:45,041
we'd have looked for her sooner.

535
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:48,408
We could have called the police
and wouldn't be in this mess.

536
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:53,041
I didn't lie.
- Yes, you did. You knew Feline is gay.

537
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:56,657
You saw those photos, didn't you?
She would never have gone with Stijn.

538
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:59,708
It just made sense.
- No, it didn't.

539
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:05,202
Did you really see those photos?
- No.

540
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,915
We were just really wasted.
And you thought so too.

541
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:17,781
You don't lie about such things.
- It's not all she lied about.

542
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:21,081
Shut up.
- Yeah?

543
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,576
Maybe you should tell Abby yourself.

544
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:28,039
About everything you did.
And with whom.

545
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,581
Because she won't take it from me.
- Cut it out, okay.

546
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,539
Yes, I didn't know.

547
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:46,956
But I shouldn't have said it.

548
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:06,661
Have something to eat.
- I'm not hungry.

549
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,160
I have a signal

550
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,832
Voicemail.

551
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,786
Casper, you have to come here now,
there's a...

552
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,156
Fuck.
- Bloody hell.

553
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:27,291
Disconnected.
How do I know if he'll get this?

554
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:56,409
What are you doing?

555
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:59,827
I'm going to light the fireplace.
- What about that man?

556
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:02,454
Bring it on.
We may have some fun after all.

557
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,203
Bring it on.
- Pippa.

558
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:08,156
Just let her have her way.
- It's dangerous.

559
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,917
He's here.

560
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,530
There's nothing we can do now.

561
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:41,406
Okay.

562
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:54,577
Stay here, okay? And push
that cupboard in front of the door.

563
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,031
Ok, ja.

564
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,042
Looking for these?

565
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:54,830
I knew little Kim would come out
to rescue her friend.

566
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:56,791
We thought you were...
- What?

567
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,039
Kidnapped by that scary man?

568
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:04,041
Nice try, but you killed Bully.

569
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:06,780
And you did something to Feline.
Look at your coat.

570
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,033
What? That's Bully's blood.

571
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,413
Of course.

572
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:12,083
Why would I want to hurt Feline?

573
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,325
Because you're a psycho.
- You're a psycho.

574
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:18,080
You were expelled
for bullying someone, Naomi.

575
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:24,282
True. She resembled you, by the way.
- You don't care about Abby at all.

576
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:26,699
You made out with Casper.

577
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:31,449
Abby won't believe you anyway. She thinks
you're just trying to make me the bad guy.

578
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:32,906
Oh yeah?

579
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,163
Go ahead.

580
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,405
let's see whom she believes.
You have no proof.

581
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,449
Thief.

582
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,333
Bitch.

583
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,955
Abby, it's me.

584
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:30,823
Fuck.

585
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,456
What happened?

586
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,289
Do you need help?
- Yes.

587
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:55,833
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

588
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:03,074
It was Pippa.
- What?

589
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,908
Or Naomi or whoever
the fuck she is.

590
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:10,415
She's upstairs, I tied her up.
- Why?

591
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:13,292
Because she's a psychopath,
that's why.

592
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,164
What about that man?
- There is no man.

593
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:21,665
Pippa has lost her mind.
She wants to destroy us all.

594
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,039
That can't be.

595
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,828
Pippa is nice.
- Yes, to you.

596
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:30,155
She wants you
and we're all in her way.

597
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:43,408
First Casper, then Feline...

598
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:45,708
First Casper, then Feline...

599
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,077
How could she...

600
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:54,285
Fuck.

601
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,664
There's a shotgun.
Under my bed, in a box.

602
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:30,913
Wat de fuck.
- Casper?

603
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:34,536
Fuck.
- What are you doing here?

604
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,327
What's going on here?

605
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:42,038
Fuck.

606
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:44,954
Here.
- It's okay.

607
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,034
Where is everyone?

608
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:50,415
Kim and Pippa are fighting.
- Fighting?

609
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,282
And I just heard a huge bang.

610
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,413
Calm down, calm down.

611
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,783
It's all Pippa's doing.

612
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:09,581
She shot Kim and Feline is gone.

613
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:13,783
And she has a picture of you.

614
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:18,788
Naked.

615
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,783
That's not what you think.

616
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:27,702
So what am I thinking?

617
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:30,827
She took that picture furtively
while I was sleeping.

618
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:35,451
So you knew about it?
- But nothing happened.

619
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:39,538
She just wanted to blackmail me.
Hey, really.

620
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:45,907
Where is everyone? Where's Kim?
- I don't know.

621
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:53,161
Okay, come.

622
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:00,538
Come.

623
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:44,531
Come.

624
01:19:58,042 --> 01:19:59,915
Kim, are you okay?

625
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:02,824
Where's Pippa?
- What happened?

626
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:05,406
Where's Pippa?

627
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,155
Okay, let's go.

628
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:22,203
Are you okay?

629
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,035
Casper.

630
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,328
Casper.

631
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,619
Casper.

632
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,326
Please, let's just go.

633
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,910
Shit.

634
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,788
Feline, are you alright?

635
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,156
Are you alright?

636
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:01,035
It's Casper.
What the fuck?

637
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,416
Easy, easy...

638
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,417
Go away.

639
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:19,782
What's the matter?

640
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:26,535
It's me, Kim.

641
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,408
I didn't do anything,
it was that man.

642
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:36,833
Come, come.
Let's go.

643
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,039
Casper.
- Piss off.

644
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:45,541
Casper, let me out.

645
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,576
Casper.

646
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,542
Abby.

647
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,332
Hey, Kim.

648
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,240
Untie me, Kim.

649
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:22,828
Abby?

650
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:26,283
Was I.... Have I...

651
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,410
Sorry.

652
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,533
I can't remember anything.

653
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:09,707
Abby, don't.
- Don't.

654
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:11,913
Abby.

655
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:21,292
Let me out.

656
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:29,788
Casper...

657
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:33,708
Kim will be staying with us
for a few days.

658
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,789
Will you keep an eye on her?

659
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:38,411
Are you scared?

660
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,167
Freak.
- Get a life.

661
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,031
Kim?

662
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:07,958
What's the matter with me?

663
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:13,281
Abby.

664
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:15,948
Sorry.

665
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:29,950
Why didn't you talk with us about it?

666
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:32,667
About that girl?

667
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:37,331
I just found out myself.

668
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:42,832
Are you okay?

669
01:29:45,542 --> 01:29:47,580
I just shot my friend.

670
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:53,417
Do you know what
happened here with Kim?

671
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:55,581
She's just totally psycho.

672
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:10,161
Abby.

673
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:15,911
How...

674
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:17,536
How's it going?

675
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:21,536
Did she enjoy it here with you?
Back then?

676
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,034
I don't... Yes, I think so.

677
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:31,660
Hey, about that picture.

678
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:34,324
It was at Feline's party...
and I was drunk.

679
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:36,954
And you weren't there.
- So it's actually my fault.

680
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:40,540
No, no, no. Nothing happened.
It's not what you think.

681
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,783
I just fell asleep.

682
01:30:42,958 --> 01:30:44,073
Naked?

683
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:51,916
Abby...
- So this is exactly what you think.

684
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,451
And I wasn't drunk.

685
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:58,083
Abby.

686
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,792
Hey, Abby.

687
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,747
Can I come in?
- She's stable now.

688
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:37,917
Sorry.

689
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:45,659
I was a bit confused.

690
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,042
I wasn't myself.

691
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:56,915
I don't know what happened here...

692
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:59,040
with Casper...

693
01:32:22,657 --> 01:32:24,958
<i>Unfortunately we
couldn't say goodbye.

694
01:32:25,131 --> 01:32:31,078
<i>I'd like to see you again.
Call me when you get home. Stijn.
