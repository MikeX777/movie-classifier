 (¶ "Troubled Mind" by Arko ¶)

2
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:17,049
     ¶ Oh, troubled mind ¶

3
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:22,187
        ¶ You make love
       so hard to find ¶

4
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,694
     ¶ Oh, troubled mind ¶

5
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:34,033
¶ I don't want to look behind ¶

6
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:40,305
     ¶ You may be strange ¶

7
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:43,509
  ¶ You were born and raised ¶

8
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:48,647
      ¶ By usual hands of
       need and praise ¶

9
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:55,287
   ¶ And now set your mind ¶

10
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,590
     ¶ You'll be my slave ¶

11
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:03,062
      ¶ And I'll be kind ¶

12
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:07,232
       ¶ Oh, silly mind ¶

13
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,302
      ¶ You make me feel ¶

14
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:14,106
       ¶ Drunk and fine ¶

15
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:19,244
       ¶ And stains that
        were once you ¶

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,716
    ¶ Are today only wine ¶

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,754
             ¶ Oh ¶

18
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:34,093
             ¶ Oh ¶

19
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,299
             ¶ Oh ¶

20
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,234
             ¶ Oh ¶

21
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,267
             - Mom.

22
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,805
     It's Christmas again.

23
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,409
          (soft music)

24
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,779
      - [Shivaani] Kabir?

25
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,697
- What's the point in knocking?

26
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,990
 You don't have to do all this.

27
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,441
        - You shouldn't
      eat all this stuff.

28
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,642
      - I like this stuff.

29
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,661
    - Why didn't you eat the
  food that I brought for you?

30
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:34,679
   I brought you fresh food.

31
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,584
   Because you don't like it?

32
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,220
      - I never said that.

33
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,526
        (water running)

34
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,328
Shivaani, I said don't do that.

35
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,897
  - You can't live like this.

36
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,764
          - Like what?

37
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,665
          - Like this.

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,565
    - I said I'll get to it.

39
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,556
        Just let it go.

40
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:56,545
   - [Shivaani] You know your
   mother would have never--

41
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,534
          - Shivaani.

42
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,672
        - She wouldn't.

43
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,518
        - Come help us.

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,321
    - I think you both have
      this under control.

45
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,490
   - He prefers to supervise.

46
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,592
- Except when it's time to eat.

47
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,560
     You used these dishes.

48
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,594
        Help wash them.

49
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,496
           - Uh huh.

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,583
       - Okay I'm coming.

51
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:28,367
   It's just that I am stuck

52
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,839
 in this dimensional time warp

53
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,344
     that slows down time.

54
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,345
          - Smart ass.

55
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,852
      - I am almost there.

56
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,886
  - Why don't you practice the
song you're gonna sing tonight?

57
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,289
      - But Kabir is stuck
        in a time warp.

58
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,592
   - Yes, so he has to watch
      without criticizing.

59
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,294
   - [Mom] Oh, you're right.

60
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,696
  - I can still hear you guys.

61
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,565
        ¶ Boy of mine ¶

62
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,633
        ¶ Boy of mine ¶

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,700
¶ Although my heart is aching ¶

64
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:03,756
         - Okay, okay.

65
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:04,810
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

66
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:05,864
 I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

67
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:06,918
          Stop, stop.

68
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,972
   Come on, you're not gonna
 really sing like that tonight?

69
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,542
        Are you please?

70
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,110
      - She's teasing you.

71
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,678
  - I will if you're stuck in
  a dimensional time whatever.

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,745
     - No, seriously don't
        do that. Please.

73
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,047
      - Seriously come on.

74
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,019
 - All right, what do you want?

75
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,859
     I said don't do that.

76
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,799
 - Are you going into the city?

77
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:34,800
          - Yes, I am.

78
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,802
             - And?

79
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,288
          - And what?

80
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:39,805
- What are you gonna tell them?

81
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,473
      - What we discussed.

82
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,941
    - So you're going back?

83
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,077
  - Yes, I said yes, Shivaani.

84
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,779
- What time is your appointment?

85
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,107
        - God, Shivaani.

86
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,099
       What do you want?

87
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,091
  - Seriously what do I want?

88
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:53,083
    - You know what I mean.

89
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,755
       - No, I don't know
     what you mean, Kabir.

90
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,857
  - Well then just let it go.

91
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,795
         - Look, we all
       loved your mother.

92
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,315
      - Shivaani, please.

93
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:07,766
         - You've got--
         - Got to what?

94
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,635
     - [Shivaani] Nothing.

95
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,904
- No, tell me what I need to do.

96
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,806
       I'm already going
      back to med school.

97
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,775
What more do you want me to do?

98
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,010
  - How about living together?

99
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,646
    How about being normal?

100
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,849
   - Shivaani, you're the one
   who told me to move here.

101
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,116
      - I didn't know that
      you were gonna live

102
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,618
in your mother's house forever.

103
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,936
    - It's only been a year.

104
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,253
   - It's a long time, Kabir.

105
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,570
     I seriously think you
     should start thinking

106
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:31,887
   about selling this house.

107
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,859
- Shivaani, don't you dare tell
  me to sell this house again.

108
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,205
        - Don't I dare?

109
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,550
     - Yeah okay 'cause I'm
    done talking about that.

110
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:37,895
       - [Shivaani] Where
         are you going?

111
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,131
  - [Kabir] I need some space.

112
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,887
        - Look, come to
      the party tomorrow.

113
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,955
       - I don't want to.

114
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,962
     - If not for my sake,
   then come for my parents.

115
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,735
     - What does this have
    to do with your parents?

116
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,871
      - If you don't come,
     then everybody's gonna

117
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,040
    ask them where you are.

118
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,575
   It'll put them in a spot.

119
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,111
 It's not fair to them, Kabir.

120
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,487
          Try to come.

121
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,727
   Come say hi to everybody.

122
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,728
             Okay?

123
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,566
      I'll see you later.

124
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:08,653
      (cell phone ringing)

125
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,865
     - Hey, how's it going?

126
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,833
       - [Catherine] Are
       you gonna come by?

127
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,869
      - I told you I have
      that party tonight.

128
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,538
    - You're gonna be at the
     hospital today right?

129
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,806
       - Yeah, I'm gonna
      be at the hospital.

130
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,575
      - So, come by after.

131
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,613
      - Catherine, listen.

132
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,647
       - Only for a sec.

133
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,618
I wanna give you your Christmas
  present before I leave town.

134
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,088
       - Okay all right.

135
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,690
       Only for a second.

136
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,691
           - Awesome.

137
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,660
  Text me when you're coming.

138
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,195
          - Yeah okay.

139
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,196
           All right.

140
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,976
          (soft music)

141
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:50,855
           - Hey KB.

142
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,855
      - [Kabir] Hey Paddy.

143
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,999
      - Oh, give me that.

144
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,701
    This Shivaani's cooking?

145
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,702
             - Yup.

146
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,339
      - How come you just
     give this stuff away?

147
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,644
      How you doing, man?

148
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,645
            - Okay.

149
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,014
   Paddy, that's disgusting.

150
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,351
     - No, it's delicious.

151
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,720
        - No, how could
       you eat like that?

152
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,721
          - Like this.

153
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,322
         Wanna try one?

154
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,190
           Here try.

155
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,057
           Try some.

156
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,092
          - Oh no way.

157
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,126
    - My fingers are clean.

158
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,661
        You can try one.

159
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,195
   - Paddy, I know for a fact
    your fingers are filthy.

160
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,342
            - What?

161
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:33,487
      - [Kabir] You don't
        wash your hands.

162
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,632
       - Of course I do.

163
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,967
   State law requires me to.

164
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,903
     - Paddy, I've seen you
     come of that bathroom

165
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,288
without washing your hands okay.

166
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,672
     - You get some alcohol
        on your fingers,

167
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,241
 you don't have to wash it off.

168
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,043
Why are you so squeamish anyway?

169
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,079
         - Med school.

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,247
      You don't wanna know
    the things that I know.

171
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,249
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

172
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,118
          Believe me.

173
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,090
            - What?

174
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,324
      - You're all dressed
      up and looking nice.

175
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,325
             - So?

176
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,728
     - Well, I just haven't
      seen you look like.

177
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,729
          - Like what?

178
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,298
- Look like you for a long time.

179
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,701
      What's the occasion?

180
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,005
        - I've got that
       meeting at school.

181
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,374
        - Oh, you think
     they'll let you back?

182
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,410
  - What does that even mean?

183
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,612
        - I don't know.

184
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,813
 Maybe they filled their quota
    on good looking doctors.

185
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,118
       You saw Shivaani.

186
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,088
        Any improvement?

187
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,690
       - [Kabir] In what?

188
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,291
    - Getting back together.

189
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,159
             - No.

190
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,226
         Not happening.

191
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,628
          - Seriously?

192
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,029
       Do I have to tell
       you what it means

193
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,864
 when a woman brings you food?

194
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,018
 - Yeah, tell me what it means.

195
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,235
   - It means she loves you.

196
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:47,405
    - Maybe she's doing what
  she thinks a wife would do.

197
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,841
       - No, she's doing
      it because she wants

198
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,376
 to get back together with you.

199
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,080
  - Okay Paddy, let's drop it.

200
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,081
            - Okay.

201
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,099
           All right.

202
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,116
 Hey, you coming to the party?

203
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,017
             - No.

204
00:11:59,019 --> 00:11:59,884
             - No?

205
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,208
         - [Kabir] No.

206
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,531
       - [Paddy] Why not?

207
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:03,854
     - Paddy, what were we
      just talking about?

208
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,945
       - About Shivaani.

209
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,034
     - Okay, I'm gonna go.

210
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,123
        - Hey, hey, hey,
      hey, hey, hey, hey.

211
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,180
      Just cheer up, man.

212
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,234
      It's Christmas okay.

213
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:10,288
       - I don't care if
        it's Christmas.

214
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,342
    - That was your mother's
       favorite holiday.

215
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:12,396
       - What do you know
        about my mother?

216
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,765
       - Are you serious?

217
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,132
   - Yeah you think Christmas
   was her favorite holiday.

218
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,499
     - Yeah, I know it was.

219
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,866
- Well you don't know anything.

220
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,037
  - Hey, hey, chill out, man.

221
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,938
- [Kabir] You chill out, Paddy.

222
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,905
           Fuck off.

247
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,405
      - Looks like you've
      been out for a year.

248
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,941
      You just left after
      your third semester.

249
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,678
      Do you think you're
      ready to come back?

250
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,481
         Mister Bakshi?

251
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,829
         - Sorry what?

252
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,241
       - [Administrator]
      I understand it was

253
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:22,653
   your mother who departed.

254
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,190
      - [Man] Your mother.

255
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,294
       - What about her?

256
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,296
     - [Man] She collapsed.

257
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,234
- [Administrator] Mister Bakshi?

258
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,516
  - What if I'm not ready yet?

259
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:42,428
       - Well, we usually
      don't allow students

260
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,340
    to be gone longer than a
  year, even for bereavement.

261
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,345
    We have to consider the
   impact such a long absence

262
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,980
  would have on your studies.

263
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,665
 This curriculum is designed--

264
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,349
    - Couldn't I apply for a
    longer leave of absence?

265
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,152
  - There's a lot of paperwork
      you'd have to submit

266
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,055
    and there's no guarantee
        it'd be granted.

267
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,558
      - When would I have
     to make that request?

268
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,327
     - I don't think that's
       such a good idea.

269
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,640
        Sometimes it's--

270
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:04,952
   - Ma'am, when would I have
   to apply for the request?

271
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:06,264
     - As soon as possible.

272
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,966
   Right after the holidays.

273
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,088
    - Hey, Bodhisattva. Huh?

274
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,693
 - Sorry what did you call me?

275
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,662
       - Can you help me
       ease my suffering?

276
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:44,736
         - [Kabir] Hey.

277
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,538
     Don't click somebody's
    picture without asking.

278
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,107
   - Or without paying, huh.

279
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,931
          - I'm sorry.

280
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,754
        Asking would've
       ruined the moment.

281
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,577
      - Yeah, you mean it
   would've ruined your shot?

282
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,597
          - Yeah, I--

283
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,614
    - No, you don't do that.

284
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,615
             Okay?

285
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,569
          (soft music)

286
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,644
             - Ow.

287
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,678
       - Watch where the
       fuck you're going.

288
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,712
        - Hey fuck you.

289
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,713
          - Fuck you.

290
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,647
         - [Mom] Kabir.

291
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,698
            - Ouch.

292
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:31,748
     Ow Mom, what the hell?

293
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,317
      - This is Christmas.

294
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,847
- (laughs) Look who's returned.

295
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:03,798
         - Hey listen.

296
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,748
  Did you see where she went?

297
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,150
             - Who?

298
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,086
 - The girl, the photographer.

299
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,455
             - Who?

300
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,193
    - [Kabir] Where is she?

301
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,095
      - She went that way.

302
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,096
          - That way?

303
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,736
              Hey.

304
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,105
         Hey, hey, hey.

305
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,140
             - Hey.

306
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,141
           - Listen.

307
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:34,112
     I wanted to apologize
         about earlier.

308
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,130
          - It's okay.

309
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,147
    I think it was my fault.

310
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:36,814
          - Oh no, no.

311
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,549
        It was my fault.

312
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,283
      It's Christmas and I
   should be nicer to people,

313
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,253
 especially to people visiting.

314
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,388
 I assume you're not from here.

315
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,190
       - I'm from Kenya.

316
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,458
          - Oh Kenya.

317
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,725
   Hey, you followed me here?

318
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,695
 - I had my picture taken, too.

319
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,831
    A lady's gotta eat, huh.

320
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,533
            - Here.

321
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,667
          - Thank you.

322
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,836
     - You got your money.

323
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,270
   You can go now. Thank you.

324
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,272
           - Hold on.

325
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:09,280
       There is something
    special between you two.

326
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,748
            No, no.

327
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,984
            Really.

328
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,219
     Just take a moment and
      look at each other.

329
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,188
          - We can go.

330
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,824
          - No really.

331
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,459
     Just take a moment and
      really look at her.

332
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,428
 Just look at her for a moment.

333
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,863
         You too, miss.

334
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:29,433
       Take a moment and
      really look at him.

335
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,568
       - Okay come here.

336
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,836
    - No, no, this is silly.

337
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,772
 - Come on, just take a moment.

338
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,443
          (soft music)

339
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,010
 - [Homeless Woman] That's it.

340
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,460
- Okay anyways, this is enough.

341
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,330
    - What about you, miss?

342
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,632
    Do you believe in karma?

343
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,900
            - I do.

344
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:03,901
        - Come this way.

345
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:04,769
     Just come on, come on.

346
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,636
      Thank you very much.

347
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,503
        Have a good day.

348
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,738
          Come, come.

349
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,407
   - Merry Christmas you two.

350
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,845
- Well, it was nice meeting you

351
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,949
    and I suppose she won't
   follow us around anymore.

352
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,884
    - She's a strange woman.

353
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,219
     - She's a crazy woman.

354
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,987
 - But I think she means well.

355
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,957
 - I think it's better you stay
   away from people like that

356
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:29,227
    because the city can be
  pretty dangerous sometimes.

357
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,361
  - [Kioni] What's your name?

358
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,462
      - My name is Kabir.

359
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,333
        - [Kioni] Kabir.

360
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,967
       - Well, my friends
     call me KB sometimes.

361
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,903
      - Which do you like?

362
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,238
          - Whatever.

363
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,772
        - I like Kabir.

364
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,241
         Is it Indian?

365
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,508
          - Yes it is.

366
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,710
     And what's your name?

367
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,979
            - Kioni.

368
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,380
            - Kioni?

369
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,514
      You're on vacation?

370
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,916
           - Kind of.

371
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,351
           - Kind of?

372
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,785
- I applied to film school here.

373
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,921
 I just finished my interview.

374
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,522
      - And how'd that go?

375
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,524
 - [Kioni] Pretty good I guess.

376
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,927
   - Yeah, I guess you never
really know about those things.

377
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,529
     So Kioni, do you know
      where you're going?

378
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,231
- I wanna see more of the city.

379
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,932
        I wanna see the
     Christmas decorations.

380
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,669
     - Okay, so you should
     take the train uptown

381
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:12,770
       because there's a
        lot of beautiful

382
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,939
Christmas decorations up there,

383
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,674
but you don't wanna go that way

384
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,408
   'cause you might bump into
    the homeless lady again.

385
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,779
  If you want, I can show you
    another subway entrance.

386
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,647
         - Can I walk?

387
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:23,514
          - From here?

388
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,715
        - [Kioni] Yeah.

389
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,017
     - No, that's too far.

390
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,527
            Listen.

391
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,528
     Since you're a visitor
       here, if you want,

392
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,900
      I can show you a few
      interesting places.

393
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:43,768
       - That'd be nice.

394
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,769
           Thank you.

395
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,572
         (gentle music)

396
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,483
   (camera shutter clicking)

397
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,928
    - Whoa, you really like
      all these buildings.

398
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,030
- Never seen anything like them.

399
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,515
            - Never?

400
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:15,999
     - I mean we have tall
      buildings in Kenya,

401
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,035
     but the architecture's
           different.

402
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,338
       Not where they're
     altogether like this.

403
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,391
   (camera shutter clicking)

404
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:24,875
     - But you keep taking
    pictures of all of them.

405
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,544
      - I know it's silly.

406
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,885
         (gentle music)

407
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:52,103
    - Well I've never really
  thought about the buildings.

408
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:54,839
       I mean, there are
    famous ones in New York

409
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:58,476
like the Empire State Building,
     the Flatiron Building,

410
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,511
the Chrysler Building, so many,

411
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,981
  but it's not like I thought
      about the buildings.

412
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,050
       - [Kioni] Why not?

413
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,718
       - [Kabir] They're
        just buildings.

414
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,819
     - You see a building.

415
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,421
         I see a story.

416
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,689
   - [Kabir] You see a story?

417
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:12,757
            - Sure.

418
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,658
     Each one has a story.

419
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,530
    - That reminds me of my
 first year in medical school.

420
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,664
       - You're a doctor?

421
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,033
        - A med student.

422
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,504
      During my first year
       in medical school,

423
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:29,073
 I lived in the student housing
 in a building on Park Avenue.

424
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,608
            - Nice.

425
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,675
        - No, not nice.

426
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,110
           Not nice.

427
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,544
 It was an old rundown building

428
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,113
      that must have been
    housing medical students

429
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,149
for like 200 years or something,

430
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:40,551
       but what you just
      said made me realize

431
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,019
     that all the students
      who ever lived there

432
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,689
     must have had stories
       and conversations

433
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,426
     and revelations about
       their time there.

434
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:52,430
   - And all the people made
   friends then fell in love.

435
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,932
     - And lost their minds
       in their studies,

436
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,001
        but no one would
      ever know walking by

437
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:59,069
       unless they were a
      part of that story.

438
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,573
     To everyone else it'd
   just be another building.

439
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,774
      - Or another story.

440
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,647
        ¶ Mozart's "The
     Marriage of Figaro" ¶

441
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,575
      Show me the pictures
        you took of me.

442
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,076
   Show me, show me, show me,
   show me, show me, show me.

443
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,645
      - Okay, look, look.

444
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,680
      - Thank you so much.

445
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,650
         - I'm married.

446
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,018
         - Ummm, Okay.

447
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,321
        - Sorry, I don't
     know why I said that.

448
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,056
 I don't know why I said that.

449
00:25:59,058 --> 00:25:59,924
           Forget it.

450
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,075
          - It's okay.

451
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,225
       I'm not trying to
        come on to you.

452
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,750
   - No, no, I know, I know.

453
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:05,273
       That's why I don't
     know why I said that.

454
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,796
      I-- I didn't mean to
      make it all awkward.

455
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,732
            Listen.

456
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,666
      - Really it's okay.

457
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,624
       - Listen, ummm...

458
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,143
   Okay, the thing is my wife
    and I recently separated

459
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,245
    and haven't been living
    together for some time.

460
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,013
          So, I just.

461
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,014
 - Hey we're just hanging out.

462
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,466
             Okay?

463
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,917
       You don't have to
    explain anything to me.

464
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,119
            - Okay.

465
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,763
        - You're kind of
        a dork you know.

466
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,631
           - A dork?

467
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:41,865
         - Total dork.

468
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:43,267
             - Why?

469
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,836
             What?

470
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,404
- A girl kisses you on the cheek

471
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,972
        and you get all
      flustered and blush.

472
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:50,908
    - That's not fair okay.

473
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,775
       You surprised me.

474
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,776
         - Sure, sure.

475
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:54,878
     - You wanna sit here?

476
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,287
      Do people give gifts
     in Kenya on Christmas?

477
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,757
    - Some people do but the
   focus is also on community

478
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,694
  and celebrating the birth of
 Jesus, which the churches do.

479
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:13,330
        My family had a
   tradition of eating cake.

480
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,068
     - You know, my family
       is not Christian,

481
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,639
 so for us Christmas was never
   about the birth of Jesus.

482
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:22,773
       - Are you Muslim?

483
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,308
       - No, not Muslim.

484
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,843
      Not really anything.

485
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:28,429
I mean, my parents were Hindus,

486
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,014
      but at home we never
     really spoke about it.

487
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,850
        - So what do you
        do on Christmas?

488
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,123
        - I never really
        liked Christmas.

489
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,958
  - You don't like Christmas?

490
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,426
      - You know if it was
      more about religion

491
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,795
     than about gift giving
      maybe I would but--

492
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:45,796
         - [Kioni] But?

493
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,040
   - My mom raised me alone.

494
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,875
        My dad died when
        I was very young

495
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,744
      and we never really
         had much money

496
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,914
     and so I never really
        liked Christmas.

497
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,151
       I would hate that
       after the holidays

498
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,053
       when all the kids
      came back to school,

499
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,387
      they'd show off all
       the amazing gifts

500
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:13,057
that they got from Santa Claus,

501
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,048
       and I'd just tried
        to hide the fact

502
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,038
         that the most
      amazing gifts I got

503
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,028
      from Santa were new
      underwear and socks.

504
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,698
    - Those are good gifts.

505
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,200
    - Well, I see that now.

506
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,169
     You know, that my mom
      was being practical

507
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,905
        and only got me
     things that I needed,

508
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:31,375
     but you know as a kid,
   it hurts when you realize

509
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,945
  that you got all the things
  you got because you're poor.

510
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,114
       Everything during
   Christmas revolves around

511
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,983
    how much money you have.

512
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,851
       The more you have,
       the better it is.

513
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,153
      - That's true about
  everything though, isn't it?

514
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,388
 - Yeah, but for kids it's not.

515
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,023
  They don't know any of that.

516
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:50,994
   As a child I could have a
   stick and call it a sword.

517
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,880
           You know?

518
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,765
    I could have a cardboard
   box and it'd be my castle

519
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,767
      and I'd be the kind
       and I'd be happy.

520
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,003
     - So why is Christmas
         any different?

521
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,739
    - It's different because
      one day you realize

522
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,941
      that Santa Claus is
       actually your mom

523
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,309
        and what you get
       has nothing to do

524
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,300
 with how good or bad you are,

525
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:09,290
       but about how much
         money you had,

526
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,280
    and that's when all the
   realities of life hit me.

527
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,983
 - You realized this as a kid?

528
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:19,523
  - I was 10 years old and my
 dad had been gone for sometime

529
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,792
and that particular year my mom

530
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:25,329
  got a fake plastic Christmas
  tree instead of the real one

531
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:28,198
    and I remember when that
   happened, I was so angry.

532
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,868
    I was so upset, I cried
      and I yelled at her.

533
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,005
      I mean, that moment
    ruined Christmas for me.

534
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,729
             - Why?

535
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,452
   - Because I knew we got a
  fake plastic Christmas tree

536
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:40,175
      because we couldn't
      afford the real one

537
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,313
     and all the illusions
       of Christmas came

538
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,183
  - I think we can all relate

539
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,917
        to feeling like
       money's a problem,

540
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,821
    but you look like you're
     doing pretty good now.

541
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,823
        - Don't judge a
      book by it's cover.

542
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,259
 - Let's get something to eat.

543
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,393
          I'm hungry.

544
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,296
  I wanna try New York pizza.

545
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,265
       - You haven't had
        New York pizza?

546
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,299
             - No.

547
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,101
      - Oh okay, let's go.

548
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:07,938
             Pizza?

549
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,362
         - [Kioni] Yes.

550
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:10,785
 - [Kabir] You have to try it.

551
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:12,208
  New York pizza is the best.

552
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,951
    - That was really good.

553
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:22,886
          - Told you.

554
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,362
     - The first Christmas
    movie I remember seeing

555
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,099
        was the "Miracle
        on 34th Street".

556
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,368
     The color version, not
    the black and white one.

557
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,304
- I saw the black and white one.

558
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:43,273
      It's about that old
      man who plays Santa

559
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,142
       in the department
       store and pretends

560
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,077
  to be the real Santa Claus.

561
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,413
     Wasn't there something
         about a house?

562
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,194
            - Yeah.

563
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:53,873
        The little girl
     wants her dream house

564
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:55,552
     for her family to live
       in and by the end,

565
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,855
they get it and it's a miracle.

566
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:58,989
            - Yeah.

567
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,891
    I sort of remember that.

568
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,960
 - It had a huge impact on me.

569
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:05,229
         I was orphaned
      really young and I--

570
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,681
      - You're an orphan?

571
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,132
  - Yeah, my parents died when
   I was eight but I wasn't--

572
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,336
  - I'm so sorry to hear that.

573
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:13,854
  I feel like such an asshole.

574
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:15,371
       I've been talking
        about being poor

575
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,007
   and about all my problems.

576
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,653
           So sorry.

577
00:31:18,654 --> 00:31:20,298
  - No, don't worry about it.

578
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:21,943
    I realized long ago that
     my life is my journey

579
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,581
    and it's just as amazing
  and difficult as anyone else

580
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,983
     that's on the planet.

581
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,653
       - [Kabir] When did
       you realize that?

582
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,421
         - It's kind of
    connected to that movie.

583
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,190
    To all Christmas movies.

584
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,158
   Those movies were fantasy.

585
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,495
  Like the idea that you could
  ask for whatever you wanted

586
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:43,400
and just get it, that's amazing,
   and I totally fell for it.

587
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,569
        I didn't really
    understand who Santa was

588
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,905
  until after my parents died,

589
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,107
        and so my first
    Christmas without them,

590
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:53,343
  my first in the orphanage, I
 used to write letters to Santa

591
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,479
       and I'd wish for a
       house and a family

592
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,248
        and I'd cry when
       it didn't happen.

593
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,616
      - How can you still
        like Christmas?

594
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,919
   I'd hate it if I were you.

595
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:05,122
  - All those hopes and wishes
and unanswered letters to Santa

596
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,324
      revealed to me what
        I want in life.

597
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,226
The dreams of a child are basic,

598
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:12,462
  but they're the backbone of
  who we are when we grow up.

599
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,097
    - But what if you don't
    get any of those things?

600
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,066
 - I already have those things.

601
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,135
     We have everything we
      want all our lives.

602
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,938
     We just have to change
        our perspective.

603
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:25,609
       I wanted a family
   growing up and I had one.

604
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,344
    The kids I grew up with.

605
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,313
    The women who raised me.

606
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,715
    The lady from my church
    who helped me get here.

607
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,286
       They're my family.

608
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:40,490
  And I've always had a place
 to live and food in my belly.

609
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,096
   I may not have my mom and
 dad anymore, but I have them.

610
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,097
          I'm blessed.

611
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,500
 - And you're willing to leave
 all that and come to America?

612
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,852
 You wouldn't want to stay back

613
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,203
       and help the kids
       in the orphanage?

614
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,705
         - But I will.

615
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,040
        Coming here and
    continuing my education

616
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,977
    is the best thing I can
     do to help my people.

617
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,012
       Once I'm done with
     school, I can go back

618
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,281
     and help other people
       tell their stories

619
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:07,517
     and while I'm here, I
    can meet people like you

620
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,720
   and tell them about Kenya.

621
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,624
      - Kioni, I must say
   you're a very brave girl.

622
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,194
      - If I was brave, I
   would've gone ice skating.

623
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,097
 - No, I said brave not crazy.

624
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,131
       - [Catherine] KB?

625
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:44,521
       - What time is it?

626
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,692
    - It's ten after eight.

627
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,430
       - Oh no listen...

628
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,349
           I'm late.

629
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,267
   I was supposed to be home
  by nine to sing with my mom.

630
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,136
     She's gonna be upset.

631
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,304
            - Nine?

632
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,471
     You've plenty of time.

633
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,638
Just stay a couple more minutes.

634
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,507
      - No listen, listen.

635
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,425
            I can't.

636
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:05,342
       I can't miss this.

637
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,343
            - Well.

638
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:10,047
       At least open your
      gift before you go.

639
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,716
             Here.

640
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,587
     - Wow, it's beautiful.

641
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,324
       - That is just the
     wrapping, knucklehead.

642
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,325
            Open it.

643
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,436
     - I don't know why I'm
      feeling so nervous.

644
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,137
 - What are you nervous about?

645
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,474
       - How about I open
    this when you get back?

646
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:38,341
             - No.

647
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,209
        No, open it now.

648
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,210
            Come on.

649
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,078
       - But I feel bad.

650
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,945
   I didn't get you anything.

651
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:42,812
   - Well it doesn't matter.

652
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:43,679
           Open mine.

653
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,666
      - Catherine, listen,

654
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:52,944
     how about we both open
       our gifts together

655
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:54,222
  when we see each other next?

656
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:56,226
   - KB, you are killing me.

657
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,172
           - Listen.

658
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,106
     I wanna do this right.

659
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,640
            - Yeah?

660
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,641
            - Yeah.

661
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:16,580
          Look at me.

662
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,649
     When you're back from
      the holidays, let's

663
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,819
      - Do what for real?

664
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,256
   - Be together. You and me.

665
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,194
  - And what about your wife?

666
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,707
           - No wife.

667
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,276
           - No wife?

668
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,483
      - I think it's time
       I called it quits.

669
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,784
     - You mean leave her?

670
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,195
    - Is that okay with you?

671
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,296
          - Seriously?

672
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,267
Are you sure you don't wanna...?

673
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,301
         - I want this.

674
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,337
      I wanna be with you.

675
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,207
             Okay?

676
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:18,942
            - Yeah.

677
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:27,584
             Okay.

678
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,322
             - Hi.

679
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,323
             - Hi.

680
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,326
       Hi, I'm Catherine.

681
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,594
      - Hello, I'm Kioni.

682
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,333
    - So how have you been?

683
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,269
   I haven't seen you since--

684
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,271
  - Yeah, I've been all right.

685
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,506
    - Did you leave school?

686
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,344
   - No, I've been on leave.

687
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,879
   You know the bereavement.

688
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,747
           My mother.

689
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,882
      - Your mother, yeah.

690
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,953
       - How've you been?

691
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:05,488
            - Good.

692
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,390
   I graduate next semester.

693
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,894
   We've all been going crazy
     trying to get placed.

694
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,463
     Are you a med student?

695
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,665
       - No, I've applied
        to film school.

696
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,766
      - Oh, that's great.

697
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,242
      I tried to call you
     like a million times.

698
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,811
     I was just wondering.

699
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:33,416
   I mean, I just was hoping
      that you were okay.

700
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,388
    - Yeah, I've been okay.

701
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,389
         - That's good.

702
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:40,857
         That's great.

703
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,858
         That's great.

704
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,929
   And Shivaani, she's okay?

705
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,666
      - Shivaani's great.

706
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,268
  Shivaani's been good, yeah.

707
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:57,407
       - Well, it was so
        good to see you.

708
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,809
 - It was good to see you, too.

709
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,569
     - I'm getting married.

710
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,519
        I don't know why
       I just said that.

711
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,690
         I guess I just
      wanted you to know.

712
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,696
- I'm happy for you, Catherine.

713
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:21,698
        Congratulations.

714
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,067
           - Thanks.

715
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:28,738
             Okay.

716
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,309
      So, Merry Christmas.

717
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:33,910
         - To you, too.

718
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,815
       - Merry Christmas.

719
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,486
         (gentle music)

720
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,360
    You've been pretty quiet
  since we ran into Catherine.

721
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,494
        Everything okay?

722
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,999
  - No, it's just this night.

723
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:33,403
    I mean, not this night,
    but this night last year

724
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,904
      when my mother died.

725
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:35,905
            - Yeah?

726
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,842
- I was going to leave my wife.

727
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,946
       - To be with that
       woman? Catherine?

728
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:44,781
            - Yeah.

729
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,021
   - But then your mom died.

730
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,061
            - Yeah.

731
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,966
        - What happened?

732
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,774
          (soft music)

733
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:17,814
    - Kabir, where you been?

734
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,983
 - What are you talking about?

735
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:20,984
        It's only nine.

736
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,052
         - Your mother.

737
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:25,855
       - What about her?

738
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,424
     - [Man] She collapsed.

739
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,092
       They think it was
        a heart attack.

740
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,667
   - She had a heart attack.

741
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:38,868
    - [Kioni] I'm so sorry.

742
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:44,841
     - My wife's family has
  this annual Christmas party

743
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,577
      and my mother and I
     were supposed to sing.

744
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,912
            - Sing?

745
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:49,946
         Like karaoke?

746
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,583
        - No, this song.

747
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:02,158
  But I was with Catherine at
  her house while my mother...

748
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:16,873
You know, I think I killed her.

749
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,743
      I think that killed
         her, you know.

750
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,779
   Sounds ridiculous, right?

751
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,849
       - No, it doesn't.

752
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,019
         (gentle music)

753
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,628
   [Kioni] For a long time I
 thought I'd killed my parents.

754
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,429
             - Why?

755
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,229
     What happened to them?

756
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,598
        - Car accident.

757
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,803
         (gentle music)

758
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:48,238
    - [Kabir] How could you
   think that was your fault?

759
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,073
        - I don't know.

760
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,907
    It's what people think.

761
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:53,741
 Maybe if I'd done this or done
  that, they'd still be alive.

762
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:54,878
        That's not true.

763
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,012
    It's beyond our control.

764
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,716
    The question you've got
   to answer is what's next?

765
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,285
         How do I go on
      without this person?

766
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,521
    - Easier said than done.

767
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,544
 - Why were you with Catherine

768
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:12,195
       that night instead
        of your family?

769
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,196
        - I don't know.

770
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,032
         - Yes, you do.

771
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,635
         (gentle music)

772
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,808
   - [Kabir] Making me follow
     traditions from India

773
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,377
  when I was raised in America

774
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,945
        is like having a
       split personality.

775
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,748
   It drove me crazy until I
 finally said enough is enough.

776
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,917
     - [Kioni] You mean by
     being with Catherine?

777
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,302
        - [Kabir] Yeah.

778
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,686
       - [Kioni] But when
      I kissed your cheek,

779
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,321
  you told me you're married.

780
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,273
       - [Kabir] I don't
     know why I said that.

781
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:42,224
   - [Kioni] Because in your
     heart, you're married.

782
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,695
     - [Kabir] Yeah, maybe.

783
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:49,098
         (gentle music)

784
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:27,904
  - [Kioni] What was the song?

785
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:29,126
      - [Kabir] The song?

786
00:43:29,127 --> 00:43:30,347
  - [Kioni] The song that you
 were gonna sing with your mom?

787
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:31,568
- [Kabir] You wouldn't know it.

788
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:32,789
       My mom picked it.

789
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,010
 - [Kioni] Oh, let's go there.

790
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:35,378
        Can you sing it?

791
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,513
         - [Kabir] Now?

792
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,647
    - [Kioni] Yeah, come on.

793
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,115
  - [Kabir] No, it's too cold.

794
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,252
       - Don't be a dork.

795
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:44,287
  - [Kabir] I can really sing.

796
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,305
       - [Kioni] Hold on.

797
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:46,322
     Let me take a picture.

798
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,624
         Sure you can.

799
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:48,734
        - [Kabir] I can.

800
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:49,843
 - [Kioni] Then let's hear it.

801
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:50,952
       - [Kabir] No, I've
       got a better idea.

802
00:43:50,953 --> 00:43:52,061
     - [Kioni] What's that?

803
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,029
    - [Kabir] Dyker Heights.

804
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,347
        - [Kioni] What?

805
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:55,664
      - [Kabir] Oh you're
   going to love this place.

806
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,302
         (gentle music)

807
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:33,770
- [Kioni] This place is amazing.

808
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:37,373
      - Yup, it's American
     Christmas on steroids.

809
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:41,344
     - I knew people put up
decorations, but this is unreal.

810
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:44,080
      - Like a fairytale?

811
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,817
       My mother used to
        love this place.

812
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,318
     She'd come every year.

813
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,687
      - You don't like it?

814
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,322
        - I don't know.

815
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:53,956
     It's just another way
      for some rich people

816
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,109
   to show how rich they are.

817
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,261
    - But you could also say
  it's pretty magical, right?

818
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,301
        - That's what my
      mother used to say.

819
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,937
       "It's so magical."

820
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:13,309
            Anyways.

821
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,186
         (gentle music)

822
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:03,059
     How did the people of
      Kenya react to 9/11?

823
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:06,763
  I heard the response around
  the world was very... mixed.

824
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:09,966
 - I think most people mourned.

825
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:14,036
    I was pretty young but I
   remember seeing the images

826
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,805
    and they stayed with me.

827
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:18,842
 It was the first time I'd ever

828
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,877
      really thought about
       the United States

829
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,912
       and the first time
      I ever saw New York.

830
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:25,815
    All those tall buildings
    and I remember thinking,

831
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:28,151
    who would wanna destroy
      something like that?

832
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,052
 It was very confusing for me.

833
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:40,129
        (camera beeping)

834
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,714
  - [Kabir] What's the matter?

835
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,298
   - My memory card is full.

836
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,400
         - Did you take
      that many pictures?

837
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,469
     - [Kioni] I guess so.

838
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,070
       - [Kabir] What is
     that like a thousand?

839
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:49,405
        - I don't know.

840
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,842
 I'll have to buy another one.

841
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,510
- All right, I'll give you one.

842
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,179
      I have some at home.

843
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,947
    - You're a photographer?

844
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,816
       - My mom was fond
        of photography.

845
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:11,227
  Are people racist in Kenya?

846
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:13,930
      - People are racist
      everywhere, I think.

847
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:17,066
       - I know but after
      9/11, it got worse.

848
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,067
            - Worse?

849
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,536
    - Yeah, I mean you know
     when I was growing up,

850
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,004
 there were always these jerks
   who were making fun of me

851
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,307
   because of my skin color.

852
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:25,508
        You know, brown.

853
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,011
           Whatever.

854
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,513
   But after 9/11, it seemed
    like I was the terrorist

855
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,832
      and that was really
        confusing to me

856
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:34,249
     because I had no idea
      why they were saying

857
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,518
    such mean things to me.

858
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:38,955
 - Do you resent white people?

859
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,256
  - Do I resent white people?

860
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:41,902
            - Yeah.

861
00:47:41,903 --> 00:47:43,547
   I can see how some people,

862
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:45,192
       especially in this
  country, could resent them.

863
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:49,165
    - No, I mean, I get what
     you're saying, but...

864
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,400
   If my friend Paddy doesn't
      resent white people,

865
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,169
then I see no reason why I can.

866
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:55,171
         - Who's Paddy?

867
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,207
 - Paddy's like an uncle to me.

868
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,543
      He gave my mother a
      job as a bookkeeper

869
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,911
     after my father died.

870
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:05,514
    So he's pretty much had
    a hand in supporting us

871
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:07,016
     and taking care of us.

872
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:08,184
        - Is he Indian?

873
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:10,219
- No, Paddy's African American.

874
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,422
     He was born during the
  Civil Rights movement, too.

875
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,243
    He's much older than me.

876
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:18,593
        But he's seen a
      lot of crazy stuff.

877
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,552
        - Racist stuff?

878
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:22,509
      - Yeah but you know
     even with all of that,

879
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,466
 he's remained such a positive
     person his whole life.

880
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,252
   If I had to pick, I'd say

881
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:28,036
      Paddy's the kindest
      person that I know.

882
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,378
            - What?

883
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:38,798
        - I don't know.

884
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,049
      I was a real asshole
         to him today.

885
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,050
          - To Paddy?

886
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,251
         What happened?

887
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,437
       - I actually don't
      know what happened.

888
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:46,622
      I just bit his head
       off for no reason.

889
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,291
 - But if he's kind as you say,

890
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:50,192
         he's probably
     already forgiven you.

891
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,128
         - Yeah, maybe.

892
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,131
        - But you should
        tell him though.

893
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,065
       - That I'm sorry?

894
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:56,998
     - That you're a jerk.

895
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,439
             Click.

896
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:11,213
       You have some nice
     Christmas decorations.

897
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,949
      - They're my mom's.

898
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,250
 - So they've been out for...?

899
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,618
   - Since she passed, yeah.

900
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,056
     - Can we turn them on?

901
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,624
   - The lights on the tree?

902
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,726
        - Yeah, come on.

903
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:24,727
            Come on.

904
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:29,398
         (gentle music)

905
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:40,343
    How do we turn them on?

906
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:56,225
        These are really
       nice decorations.

907
00:49:57,562 --> 00:50:00,296
      - Yeah, my mom used
       to make ornaments.

908
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,199
         Like this one.

909
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,337
     - That's really nice.

910
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,774
   - People used to gift her
     ornaments all the time

911
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:14,510
     because they knew how
   much she loved Christmas.

912
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:16,763
         Like this one.

913
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:17,780
     This one's from Paddy.

914
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,552
It's been a wonderful day today.

915
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:27,690
   - It has been really nice.

916
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:31,260
         (gentle music)

917
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,238
   [Kioni] What was her name?

918
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:44,306
          - My mom's?

919
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:45,307
            - Yeah.

920
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:47,410
            - Aasha.

921
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:50,046
  Aasha means "hope" in Hindi.

922
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,416
            - Aasha.

923
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:54,583
     That's a pretty name.

924
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,724
    Merry Christmas, Aasha.

925
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,063
    - Merry Christmas, mom.

926
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,410
            - Kabir?

927
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,393
          (Door slams)

928
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,233
          - Shivaani.

929
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,734
        Shivaani, wait.

930
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,303
       - You disgust me.

931
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,518
        - Shivaani, it's
      not what you think.

932
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:49,732
     - No, then what is it?

933
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:50,946
     - She's just a friend.

934
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:52,160
       She's from Kenya.

935
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:53,374
      - I don't care where
       she's from, Kabir.

936
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:54,543
      - [Kabir] Just come
       inside, Shivaani.

937
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,395
    It's not what you think.

938
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:58,246
 - You know, when you dishonor
   me, you dishonor yourself.

939
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,515
   You dishonor your mother.

940
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,450
 - No, you're misunderstanding.

941
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,384
     - I spend a year being
       patient with you.

942
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:05,488
    To give you space to go
    through all your stuff,

943
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,590
     but the truth is that
    you were just like this

944
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,592
        even before your
      mother passed away.

945
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:10,659
       You don't see me.

946
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:12,261
     You only see yourself.

947
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,265
        I'm done, Kabir.

948
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:17,800
            - Done?

949
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:18,734
        Done with what?

950
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,667
   Shivaani, where you going?

951
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:22,738
 Shivaani, listen to me please.

952
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,580
      - You know I didn't
       want to marry you?

953
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,350
         - You didn't?

954
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,285
      - Well, I thought it
    worked for our parents,

955
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,454
so why wouldn't it work for us?

956
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:40,156
    I mean it sounded better
    than all the dating apps

957
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,557
  and all the other nonsense.

958
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,428
     It was such a mistake.

959
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,963
             - No.

960
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,497
        No, Shivaani, it
       wasn't a mistake.

961
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,031
      - I'm not finished.

962
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:52,565
     Maybe I'm not a trophy
       but I'm not a mat

963
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,503
       that you can just
       walk all over me.

964
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,177
        I'm a strong and
     capable woman, Kabir,

965
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,712
         and I won't be
    disrespected like this.

966
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,782
        I'm done trying
       to make you happy.

967
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,686
       I'm done trying to
      make you notice me.

968
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,355
      Or to make you feel
      loved and cared for.

969
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,724
I need those things for myself.

970
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,426
      - I understand that.

971
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:18,450
    That's what I'm saying.

972
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:19,473
     This is a good start.

973
00:53:19,474 --> 00:53:20,496
   - I'm really done, Kabir.

974
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,383
      - [Kabir] Shivaani,
        I think we need

975
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:24,567
   to talk about this please.

976
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,161
           - Please.

977
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:29,917
         Let's just go
      through the holidays

978
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:30,673
      and then we'll get a
  divorce and you can go back

979
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:33,275
 to whatever... life you want.

980
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:34,743
 - No, no, no, going back okay.

981
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:35,611
      I've had a bad year.

982
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:36,979
           That's it.

983
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,346
       Just come inside.

984
00:53:38,347 --> 00:53:39,713
    - It's too late, Kabir.

985
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,351
    - Shivaani, I realize I
     have wronged you okay.

986
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,286
        I know that but
       please understand.

987
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,621
   You have to know that I--

988
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:47,856
   - You think I don't know?

989
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,228
 I don't need your confession.

990
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,502
      - Then I don't know
       what else to say.

991
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:01,971
   - That's it then I guess.

992
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:07,776
        - No, Shivaani.

993
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:08,644
      Don't go like this.

994
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:09,779
          Come inside.

995
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,913
          We can talk.
       - Goodbye, Kabir.

996
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:15,317
         (gentle music)

997
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:01,930
       - Everything okay?

998
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:06,902
         - Not really.

999
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,837
   - I feel like I should go.

1000
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:09,972
       - No, no you stay.

1001
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,757
           It's okay.

1002
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:13,541
        - I don't wanna
       cause any trouble.

1003
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:16,679
       - Any trouble that
      I'm in is my fault.

1004
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,380
   - Still I should get home.

1005
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:22,785
      Can I still get the
      memory card please?

1006
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:23,619
           - Oh yes.

1007
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:24,486
             Sorry.

1008
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:25,788
          One second.

1009
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:26,955
        I think it's...

1010
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,567
             Here.

1011
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,035
           - Thanks.

1012
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,638
    Is there anything on it?

1013
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,640
    - No, I don't think so.

1014
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,975
      - If there is, I'll
      send it to you okay.

1015
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:48,544
            - Okay.

1016
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:49,545
             Yeah.

1017
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:57,519
      Kioni, did you wanna
      grab some breakfast?

1018
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,394
          - Silly man.

1019
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,797
         (gentle music)

1020
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,503
    - Hey everybody, Mister
      bah hum bug is here.

1021
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:15,604
          - Hey Paddy.

1022
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:16,939
     Meet my friend Kioni.

1023
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:18,374
   (camera shutter clicking)

1024
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,709
        - Oh Jesus, man.

1025
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,043
      What'd you bring the
   paparazzi up in here for?

1026
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,578
- I'm an anthropologist studying

1027
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,546
      the primitive habits
        of New Yorkers.

1028
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,881
- I'll take it as a compliment.

1029
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:26,849
        Where you from?

1030
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:27,716
            - Kenya.

1031
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,386
            - Kenya?

1032
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,055
Oh, we have a Christmas special
   for folk from Kenya today.

1033
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,656
 Food and drinks on the house.

1034
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:35,791
        - On the house?

1035
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:36,725
        - [Paddy] Yeah.

1036
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,658
      - He means for free.

1037
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:39,887
         - You hungry?

1038
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:41,113
       - [Kioni] Starved.

1039
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,339
      - I'm going get you
        a Paddy special.

1040
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,565
 - Oh no, you don't want that.

1041
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,534
       - KB, you love the
      Paddy special, man.

1042
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:47,169
            Come on.

1043
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,803
- Paddy, it's not even special.

1044
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:50,437
       It's french fries,
      eggs, salsa, gravy,

1045
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,119
    and God knows what else.

1046
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,798
   - [Paddy] It's delicious.

1047
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:55,477
       - I'll try it and
        an Irish coffee.

1048
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:56,745
        - Irish coffee?

1049
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,012
     - [Kioni] Yes please.

1050
00:56:58,013 --> 00:56:59,279
       - You know that's
       got whiskey in it?

1051
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,546
 - That's the Irish part right?

1052
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,950
      - Okay, okay, okay.

1053
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,485
        She's dangerous.

1054
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,320
             Okay.

1055
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:05,154
  - Yeah, I'll have the same.

1056
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,689
     - Two Paddy specials.

1057
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:09,992
          - Thank you.

1058
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,478
             What?

1059
00:57:12,479 --> 00:57:13,862
       - Food ain't gonna
       make itself, man.

1060
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:15,697
      - Oh come on, Paddy.

1061
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,648
          Not right--

1062
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:17,598
      - But you know where
        the kitchen is.

1063
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:18,548
          Get cooking.

1064
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:19,498
            Come on.

1065
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,103
        - All right sir.

1066
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,704
      - And make it three
         Paddy specials

1067
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:24,606
 if you want one for yourself.

1068
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,074
  - [Kabir] All right captain.

1069
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:37,119
       - So when did you
     meet Mister Charming?

1070
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,554
    - Yesterday in the city.

1071
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:39,855
      He showed me around.

1072
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,380
    - What did he show you?

1073
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:44,103
     - I'm kind of obsessed
        with Christmas,

1074
00:57:44,104 --> 00:57:45,826
     so I made him show me
    all the Christmas stuff.

1075
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,463
- He showed you Christmas stuff?

1076
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:48,497
            - Yeah.

1077
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,115
      We've been all over.

1078
00:57:50,116 --> 00:57:51,732
   We even went to Brooklyn.

1079
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,318
        - Dyker Heights?

1080
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:54,902
    - Yeah, it was amazing.

1081
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,039
 - Yeah, sound like the place.

1082
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,858
  You take any pictures there?

1083
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:00,676
     - Sure, but they're on
     my other memory card.

1084
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:02,845
       I can show you the
   picture I took of you now.

1085
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:03,712
         - Even better.

1086
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:04,713
            - Okay.

1087
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,017
          (soft music)

1088
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:12,955
            - Yeah.

1089
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:13,956
         - What's this?

1090
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,124
        - What is that?

1091
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,694
 Where'd you take this picture?

1092
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,601
Hey, what's taking so long, man?

1093
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:26,268
         - It's coming.

1094
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,135
          It's coming.

1095
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:28,320
         Paddy, listen,

1096
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:29,504
      I wanna talk to you
        about yesterday.

1097
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,039
         - About what?

1098
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,527
   - I wanna apologize, okay?

1099
00:58:34,528 --> 00:58:36,545
    I didn't really mean to
     say all those things.

1100
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:37,779
     - You wash your hands?

1101
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:39,248
       - Yeah, of course.

1102
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,249
            - Liar.

1103
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,152
  Aww, man that's disgusting.

1104
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,787
      - [Kabir] It smells
     like fresh roses okay.

1105
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,723
 - You're gonna burn the food.

1106
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,207
          - I got it.

1107
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,388
        Listen, I'm just
     saying that I'm sorry.

1108
00:58:52,389 --> 00:58:53,569
      I didn't mean to say
       all those things.

1109
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,750
 I was just in a very bad mood.

1110
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:55,931
       - [Paddy] Really?

1111
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,199
            - Yeah.

1112
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,934
 - You wanna make it up to me?

1113
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:00,569
        - [Kabir] Sure.

1114
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:02,070
  - Come to the party tonight.

1115
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,071
            - Party?

1116
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:05,607
      Shivaani's parents?

1117
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:06,608
         - [Paddy] Yup.

1118
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:10,178
      - No Paddy, I don't
        know about that.

1119
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,813
   Listen, I had a fight with
     Shivaani this morning.

1120
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:14,233
      It was just a mess.

1121
00:59:14,234 --> 00:59:16,652
  - You just apologize because
you're gonna come to the party.

1122
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:20,889
- Come on, don't do this to me.

1123
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,958
- Man, but you disrespected me.

1124
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,093
   You disrespected Christmas
    which is the same thing

1125
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:27,162
   as disrespecting your mom.

1126
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:29,598
  - Okay now that's a stretch.

1127
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,166
        - You missed the
        party last year.

1128
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,668
    Don't miss it this year.

1129
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:34,836
    - That's just not fair.

1130
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:35,871
 - It's not about what's fair.

1131
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,205
    It's about what's right.

1132
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,711
             Good?

1133
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:44,947
    Hey, don't burn my food.

1134
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,915
  And don't spit in it either.

1135
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,850
     All right, I know you.

1136
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,791
         (gentle music)

1137
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:14,176
   - You wanna grab breakfast
       tomorrow morning?

1138
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:18,146
 - I'd like that but let's not
  have the Paddy special okay.

1139
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:20,666
     - You don't like that?

1140
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:21,950
       - No, not really.

1141
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,152
       - It wasn't good.

1142
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,721
       - It was horrible.

1143
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,356
        Gravy and salsa?

1144
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,124
        - I warned you.

1145
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,891
 - You should've tried harder.

1146
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:35,197
      - Listen I hope this
        isn't a goodbye.

1147
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,833
      - No, of course not.

1148
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,243
         (gentle music)

1149
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,142
      - What do you think
        about this tree?

1150
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,943
This tree's about nine, 10 feet.

1151
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:22,778
       What do you think?

1152
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,263
             Yeah?

1153
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,747
        - You know, it's
       a little too big.

1154
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:27,349
    - All right, well I got
      more trees out here.

1155
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,950
            Come on.

1156
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:29,985
   Have you been here before?

1157
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,019
         - [Kabir] No.

1158
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,214
             - No?

1159
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:33,408
   Watch your step over here.

1160
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:34,602
I know it's a little bit muddy.

1161
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:35,796
       Sorry about that.

1162
01:01:35,797 --> 01:01:36,990
       So what size tree
        you looking for?

1163
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:37,859
         - Don't know.

1164
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:38,981
         - Don't know?

1165
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:40,102
  So I'll give you an example.

1166
01:01:40,103 --> 01:01:41,223
 Like for this tree right here,

1167
01:01:41,224 --> 01:01:42,344
       if you wanna know
        the size of it,

1168
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:43,465
 it's right here at the bottom.

1169
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:44,767
          Take a look.

1170
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,068
    It says five, six foot.

1171
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,369
       Is that something
      you're looking for?

1172
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,104
 It's a little bit much larger.

1173
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,709
       - That's the one.

1174
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,010
    - That's a good choice.

1175
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:56,044
        I'll take it to
       the front for you.

1176
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:56,962
            - Yeah.

1177
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:57,879
     - Tie it on your car?

1178
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,796
       - Thank you, yes.

1179
01:01:58,797 --> 01:01:59,713
          - Let's go.

1180
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:09,858
             Okay.

1181
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,741

1183

             ¶ Oh ¶

1185

           ¶ Oh, oh ¶

1193
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:14,216
      - You would've loved
        this tree, Mom.

1194
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:25,126
       (soft piano music)

1195
01:04:56,627 --> 01:04:58,126
    - [Shivaani] You shaved.

1196
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:01,563
            - Yeah.

1197
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:08,503
    I wanted to talk to you
  about what happened earlier.

1198
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:10,972
   - It's okay, I understand.

1199
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:13,575
       - You understand?

1200
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,142
       - Paddy explained
      the situation to me.

1201
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:17,279
     He told me about your
       friend from Kenya.

1202
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:26,121
   - You know, you're right.
  About what you said earlier.

1203
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:29,925
   I don't know what's next.

1204
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:32,460
    - We don't have to talk
      about it right now.

1205
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,461
            - Just.

1206
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:36,364
            Please.

1207
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:41,403
            - Okay.

1208
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:50,245
     - I don't know what's
       next but I do know

1209
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,481
      that letting you go
     without trying harder

1210
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:57,619
    or doing something about
   it would be a big mistake.

1211
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:03,391
         Shivaani, you
      deserve to be happy.

1212
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:06,261
   And if being apart is what
  makes you happy, then okay,

1213
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:09,965
        but I'm not sure
      that's what I want.

1214
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:13,635
  You said I only see myself.

1215
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:18,039
      And I hate to admit
       it but it's true,

1216
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:24,479
      but I swear Shivaani
     I wanna see you, too.

1217
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:27,248
  I really wanna see you, too.

1218
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:30,418
           - Thanks.

1219
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:36,558
   Thank you for saying this.

1220
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:45,133
      But I can't give you
      an answer right now.

1221
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:49,471
        - Yeah, I know.

1222
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:55,610
  - Maybe after the holidays.

1223
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:03,618
            - Okay.

1224
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:08,556
             - Hey.

1225
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:12,761
       I'm glad you came.

1226
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:19,434
           - Me too.

1227
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:31,679
       (soft piano music)

1228
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:57,772
              Hey.

1229
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:58,740
          I thought--

1230
01:07:58,742 --> 01:07:59,774
    What are you doing here?

1231
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,309
      - Paddy invited me.

1232
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:03,795
       - Oh he did, huh?

1233
01:08:03,796 --> 01:08:05,479
       - He said there's
     going to be something.

1234
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,033
          - Some what?

1235
01:08:08,034 --> 01:08:09,417
      - He just said that
       I should be here.

1236
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,655
  - [Paddy] Hey, is everybody
      having a good time?

1237
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:14,722
  Are you having a good time?

1238
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:15,957
         - [Crowd] Yes.

1239
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,191
     - That's more like it.

1240
01:08:17,192 --> 01:08:18,425
  Listen, can you all join me
 in this room over here please?

1241
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,561
        This next room.

1242
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:20,695
   Come on, come on, come on.

1243
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:21,829
        I like the walk.

1244
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:22,963
        I like the walk.

1245
01:08:22,964 --> 01:08:24,097
   That's good, that's good.

1246
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:31,606
         Hey everybody.

1247
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,575
   Last year as you all know
     we lost a dear friend.

1248
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,112
             Aasha.

1249
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,898
         Aasha Bakshi.

1250
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:42,683
  And if you recall last year,
  she sang this beautiful song

1251
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:45,520
       and we thought in
      honor of her memory.

1252
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:48,323
Well just watch for yourselves.

1253
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:49,524
     All right that's good,
   that's good, that's good.

1254
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:50,659
        Okay we're good?

1255
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,793
   Okay Aasha, take it away.

1256
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:56,498
  - Merry Christmas everyone.

1257
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,301
    This is a beautiful song
   that my son really loves.

1258
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,271
  We were supposed to sing it
   together as duet tonight,

1259
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:04,906
    but since he's not here,

1260
01:09:04,908 --> 01:09:06,908
       he will just have
      to watch the video.

1261
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,377
           - Come on.

       ¶ I seemed to know
    that you'd want to go ¶

1272
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:55,924
¶ Pride in your manhood waking ¶

1273
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:00,728
        ¶ I'll be here ¶

1274

        ¶ Waiting here ¶

1275

1282
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:42,904

   ¶ There's no place to go ¶

1288
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:14,435

1289
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:18,940
        ¶ Mom of mine ¶

        ¶ Mom of mine ¶

1291
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:41,629
     Merry Christmas, Mom.

1292
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:56,744
     You are a tricky man.

1293
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,314
      - Hey, it wasn't me.

1294
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:00,315
          It was her.

1295
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:02,583
            - Kioni?

1296
01:12:02,585 --> 01:12:04,052
 - [Paddy] It was all her idea.

1297
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:06,287
      - But how did you--

1298
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:07,721
     - It was on the memory
       card you gave me.

1299
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:12,727
  - I don't know what to say.

1300
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:13,728
           Thank you.

1301
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:21,002
  Thank you, Paddy, and thank
    you, Kioni, again. Okay?

1302
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:22,454
            - Sure.

1303
01:12:22,455 --> 01:12:23,905
    - And now I want you to
   meet some of these guests.

1304
01:12:23,907 --> 01:12:25,206
       All right come on.

1305
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:26,506
       After both of you.

1306
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,765
         (bright music)

1307
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,715
  - You look different today.

1308
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,567
        - Why different?

1309
01:13:09,568 --> 01:13:11,418
 - There's a saying in Swahili
 (speaks in foreign language).

1310
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:17,492
     - What does that mean?

1311
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:20,862
  - The letter from the heart
    can be read on the face.

1312
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,566
    - Is that what you see?

1313
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,068
    A letter from my heart?

1314
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,103
       - I see your heart
        is happy again.

1315
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,143
        - It really is.

1316
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:43,918
     - A gift... Because we
   know each other's secrets.

1317
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:57,632
   - I will grab your luggage
  now and thank you for this.

1318
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:28,496
     So I hope we see each
     other again some time.

1319
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:29,197
           - We will.

1320
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,198
        I'm sure of it.

1321
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:34,735
       - And I wish I had
      a gift to give you.

1322
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:45,480
   (camera shutter clicking)

1323
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,482
       - This is enough.

1324
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:48,483
            - Sweet.

1325
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:52,186
         You take care.

1326
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:53,187
             - Bye.

1327
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,824
         (gentle music)

1328
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,799
        You're blushing.

1329
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:05,666
         - No, I'm not.

1330
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:06,667
            - Dork.

1331
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:10,171
         (gentle music)

1332
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,814
 - And Merry Christmas, Kioni.

1333
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:21,182
       - Merry Christmas.

1334
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:28,256
         (gentle music)
