Lallie, this is John.

Wow, Lallie. I've never heard
that name before.

Well, it's really Lauren...

Okay, nice to meet you, Lallie.

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,762
JOHN: Happy birthday.
Oh, why thank you.

726
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,230

Hey, man.
Really nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

I'm actually very good
at making s'mores,

740
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,514
because when my parents
got divorced,

741
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,582
my dad didn't know
what else to do with us,

742
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,384
so he took us
on all these camping trips,

743
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,220
to like, teach us how to be men
or something.

744
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,320
Hmm.

745
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,422
So...

746
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,556
...great times.

747

Yeah.
[chuckles]

750
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,165
In the same year,
I went through puberty,

751
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,601
my parents got divorced,
and 9/11 happened.

752
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:11,702
Oh...
So...

753
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,236
That is rough.
[sighs]

754
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:14,771
It's fine.

755
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,941
Hmm.

756
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,442
When my parents got divorced,

757
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,313
it was like...

758
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:26,517
Try it in a haiku.

759
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,785
Ooh, amazing idea. Okay.

760
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,425
There was an affair.

761
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,726
Same.

762
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:36,761
Really?
Yeah.

763
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,296
Oh, my god.

Oh, okay.

Um...

767
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:47,738
I played a lot
of internet Scrabble.

Oh, no!

769
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,542
That is so sad.

770
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,944
Yeah, I did like a...
JOHN: That is...

771
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:55,746
Scrabble chat room
that I would do,

772
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,748
instead of homework.
No.

773
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,584
But yeah, it hit the spot.

774
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:01,252
I bet it did.

775
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,954
Okay.
Um...

776
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,754
That's too many syllables. Okay.

777
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,490
There was an affair.

778
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,494
Internet Scrabble saved me.

Right?

lengthy, heated conversation</i>

1062
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:03,593
<i>that I can't remember at all,
because I was in shock.</i>

1063
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,729

1064
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,329
<i>"This is it."</i>

1065
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:12,134

This is the same situation.

1069
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:23,146
He loves me and he just
doesn't know it, yet.

1070
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:24,681
We're just
gonna keep hanging out

1071
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:27,350

Hi.

1084
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,117
I am so sorry.

It's fine.

ANN: <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1089
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:08,825
This is inexcusable.

1090
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:11,328
Um, how did it go?
How did it go?

1091
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:14,498
It was great.
Um, actually, I have to go.

1092
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:16,533
I'm just glad you're okay.

1093

Okay, well.

Hey.

How are you?
JOHN: Good, how are you?

1106
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:57,807
What did you do today?
I just got back.

1107
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:00,025
I had to get out of this...

1108
00:53:00,026 --> 00:53:02,245
Kind of a huge secret
I've never told anyone before.

1109
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:04,214
Okay, so, whisper it.

1110

JOHN: I wanna try
doing stand-up.

[thuds]
Are you kidding?

1112
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,720
I have been writing a bit
in my head,

1113
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:12,322
for months.
Wait, can we like,

1114
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:14,191
actually do this?
Yes, okay.

1115
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,725
When are you free?
Let's plan it out right now.

You go.

00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,198
Fuck! Okay.

[John chuckles]
Um...

1121
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,267
No, can you go first?

1122
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:25,801
JOHN: No, you got this.

1123
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,337
ANN: Can we just watch
another stand-up special?

1124
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,005
No. Go!

1125
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:30,674
ANN: Okay.
JOHN: I still can't believe

1126
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,992
we did that.
ANN: I know!

1127
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:35,312
JOHN: It felt so good
to feel, like, nervous again

1128
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,513
and scared.
We are the coolest people

1129
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:37,747
I know.
We are.

1130
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,126
[John groans]
Okay, so,

1131
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:40,505
what are we gonna do next?

1132
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:41,885
Hmm.
I always wanted to do like,

1133
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,386
a modern,
expressionist dance class.

1134
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,656
Wait, I just took one,
last week.

1135
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,458
Weird.

1136
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,794

as friends.</i>

ANN: <i>We never kissed again,
we never hooked up again.</i>

1143
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:25,761

pretty fucked up in my head.</i>

[sighs deeply]

1145
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:33,736
What?

1146
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:36,740
Nothing.

1147
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,540
[phone chimes]

1148
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,915
So, uh...

1149
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,984
John asked me to do a project
with him, last night.

1150
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:52,922
Which I think
is a really good sign because...

1151
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:55,291
But then it's like,
"What does that mean?"

1152
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,310
Can I...
And then there was

1153
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:58,761
this other moment, I'm sorry.

1154
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,212
Okay.
There's this other moment

1155
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,665
last night, where his foot
was touching my leg,

1156
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,633
and he was seal flipper-ing me.

1157
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,436
Like just his foot
was just grazing my leg,

1158
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,638
and of course,
I wasn't gonna make a move,

1159
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,807
and neither was he.

1160
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,978
'Cause, I think he's scared
of his own feelings, you know?

1161
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,479
Why do you
still hang out with him?

1162
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,718
Because I like hanging out
with him.

1163
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,387
Don't you think
it's a little masochistic?

1164
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:27,857
No, I fully have accepted
and understand

1165
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,327
that he doesn't want to be
in a relationship right now.

1166
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:32,928
And that's fine,
because we're friends.

1167
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:34,964
For now.

1168
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,749
Mm.
And anyway,

1169
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,534
like you're always with Scott.
So, it's like.

1170
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,469
[exhales sharply]

1171
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,245
Where is everyone?

1172
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,914
They said it was too far
to come into Manhattan.

1173
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:52,716
Ha!

1174
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:53,883
MARQUITA: So, Ann.

1175
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,518
What's up with you?

1176
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,754
I'm starting
a project with John.

1177
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:58,954
[clears throat loudly]

1178
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:01,757
He has this idea

1179
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,892
and, um, I thought it was cool,
so I said yes.

1180
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:05,895
MARQUITA: Wait.

1181
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,897
You're still hanging out
with John?

1182
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:09,099
Thank you.

Baby girl.
[chuckles]

1185
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,438
No, no, no. I don't think
this is a good idea.

1186
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:16,873
Why not?

1187
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,442
Because you still like him.

1188
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,744
ANN: Yeah, but it's not
like that, we're just...

1189
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,948
working on a project together.
MARQUITA: Ann.

1190
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,448
Ann.

1191
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,650
Think about it.

So, Lallie, tell us.

1200
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,019
What is Ann's problem?

1201
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,888
Andy, we've been over this.

1202
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,690
It's that she's
repulsively naive.

1203
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,426

Repulsive.

1206
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,767
I don't believe you.
No, seriously.

I don't ever, truly,
honestly never watched porn.

1208
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,706
I don't.
JOHN: Wait, so.

Truly, honestly,
how do you like?

I kind of just think about like,
what it's like to be in love.

1212
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,722
Oh. Interesting.

1213
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:40,989
Goddamn it, Ann.

Yeah. Um...

1215
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:47,864
Tiffany, what do you think
the problem is?

1216
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:50,133
She pours out all of her power
to fill him up.

1217
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,801
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1218
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,470
Would you mind
doing me a huge favor?

1219

Yeah, anything. What's up?
