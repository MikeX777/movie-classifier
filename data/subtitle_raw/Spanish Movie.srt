1
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,886
<i>She's here.</i>

2
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,246
<i>She's arrived.</i>

3
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:30,356
<i>She's watching us.</i>

4
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,400
Who are you?

5
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:54,647
Ramira, reporting for work.

6
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:57,486
The agency sent me
to look after the children.

7
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:00,327
Touchy, touchy!
Like she pisses <i>perfume....</i>

8
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:12,118
Don't you worry, ma'am.
I'm fine!

9
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,122
Damn!

10
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:19,524
You scared the shit out of me.

11
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,718
- You must be Simeon.
- Yes.

12
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:24,605
- The son, right?
- Yes.

13
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,201
Is that how you welcome me?
I almost broke

14
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,482
my neck.

15
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,285
It wasn't me.
It was probably my sister.

16
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:34,520
Right. You look very pale.
Did you eat spoiled yogurt

17
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,918
or something?
Come here, show me your tongue.

18
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,406
Open your mouth.

19
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,886
Stick it out.

20
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:42,960
I can't see a damn thing.

21
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,076
Simeon?

22
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,677
<i>Don't open the windows.</i>

23
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:53,121
Simeon!

24
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:56,876
<i>It hurts, it really hurts...</i>

25
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,162
Where is he?

26
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:59,596
Right fucking here!

27
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,521
Why are you hiding in there?

28
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:05,362
I'm photosensitive.
I can't be exposed to sunlight.

29
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:06,357
Photo what?

30
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:07,755
Photosensitive!

31
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,679
You're just run down.

32
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:11,599
You could use some sunshine.

33
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,839
You need to get out more.
Let's go outside.

34
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:18,238
No! You don't understand!
Not the sun!

35
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,602
Don't, please! The sun!

36
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,123
Give me a break!
On the double, Barney Rubble!

37
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,806
You need some fresh air!

38
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:29,404
No!

39
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:39,366
I can't believe it!
Am I cured?

40
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,442
Mommy, Mommy! I'm cured!

41
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:50,840
Open up! Open up!

42
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,678
I have such a way with kids.

43
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:02,964
What an angel.
I won him over on my first day.

44
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:13,957
Simeon?

45
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:37,285
SUNSTOP

46
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,480
Simeon, it's time for your medicine!

47
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,316
Simeon?

48
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,559
What's the game, son?

49
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,560
What have you done?

50
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,039
This one?

51
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:30,720
Which fucking one is it?

52
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:32,477
Right.

53
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:39,804
How silly of me!
It was open.

54
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,404
Roberta, have you seen my son?

55
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:45,156
Simeon? No.

56
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,126
Let's get a few things straight,
Raimunda.

57
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,925
- Ramira.
- Ramona.

58
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,157
In this house we have rules,
understand?

59
00:05:58,327 --> 00:05:59,203
Yes, ma'am.

60
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,359
Never open a door without
first closing the previous one.

61
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,997
We open windows on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays.

62
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:08,518
If you want to open the fridge,

63
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,123
you have to fill out this form
and fax it to me.

64
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,206
These precautions are for my son.
He's photosensitive.

65
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,642
The tiniest ray of light
could make him

66
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,559
severely ill. Is that clear?

67
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,435
It's a bit chilly in here,
isn't it?

68
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,041
The heating doesn't work.
We have old-fashioned heating.

69
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:30,038
How does that work?

70
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:34,682
Isn't there a man around
to fix the?

71
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,200
A man?

72
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:37,722
I wish.

73
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:41,484
- But alas, my husband is at war.
- What war?

74
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,956
I'm alone, Bernarda, all alone.

75
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,682
So alone I could crap myself.

76
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,279
Well, I do have my children.
My precious children.

77
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,446
But I also need
the warmth of a man.

78
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:56,879
His strong arms around me,

79
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:00,599
that feeling of masculinity...

80
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,236
That's Ofendia, my daughter.
Forgive her, she's not very smart.

81
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,318
But she's exquisitely sensitive.

82
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:11,686
Oh, Diego.

83
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:14,645
Your strong arms around me,

84
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,838
pearls of sweat on your chest,

85
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,567
your firm hands stroking my body,

86
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:22,241
protecting me from this chill
in my bones

87
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,079
that suffocates me.

88
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:26,635
You said you were cold...

89
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,367
Right. By the way,
have you seen my son around?

90
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:31,802
Who? No. A boy? What's that?

91
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:35,277
Did you hear that?
Footsteps... upstairs.

92
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:48,756
Up there!

93
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,565
- What is that?
- A handle.

94
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,877
They're used for opening doors.

95
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,120
Open the damn door!

96
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,681
Yes, of course.

97
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,839
Hi. Is something wrong?

98
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,158
What was that noise?
What were you doing?

99
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,636
Sorry, I must have been
doing aerobics!

100
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,037
Palmira, this is my brother,
Pedro San Anton.

101
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:55,958
Don't be fooled. He says he can't
move, but I'm convinced he's lying.

102
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,640
He's just lazy.

103
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:02,684
<i>Like a wave,</i>
<i>your love came into my life.</i>

104
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,959
<i>Like a wave,</i>
<i>with uncanny force,</i>

105
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:11,159
<i>white foam and the sound</i>

106
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:12,442
<i>of seashells.</i>

107
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:15,485
<i>Like a wave.</i>

108
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:17,796
San Anton!

109
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:21,038
Have you seen Simeon?
I can't find him anywhere.

110
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:22,879
No, I haven't seen him...
Ramira.

111
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:24,400
Please don't go.
If you don't mind,

112
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,558
- I'd like to paint you.
- Me?

113
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:27,876
How sweet!

114
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:28,957
Okay.

115
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,875
- Now I'd like to paint your portrait.
- Of course.

116
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,002
Don't be long.

117
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:42,046
There are a lot of things to do
around the house.

118
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:11,081
It's ready.

119
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,920
Amazing!
You're a real artist!

120
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:20,282
No, no, no!

121
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:23,524
Everything I paint is crap!

122
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:26,042
There's an Irishman
who paints with his left foot

123
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,925
and a guy in Japan
who does landscapes

124
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,681
with the brush
on the end of his dick.

125
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,400
See? That was my life

126
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,159
before the accident.

127
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:38,446
How I miss adventure,
climbing mountains, sailing,

128
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,359
using the crosswalk.

129
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,440
I can't anymore. I'm paralyzed
from the double chin down.

130
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:47,156
You mean you really can't move?

131
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:49,238
You're not just being lazy
like Mom says?

132
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,806
Ofendia, hiding in my underwear

133
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,686
- drawer again?
- So you can't feel this?

134
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,322
No, sweetie.

135
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:57,806
What about this?

136
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,802
Nothing at all.
Kids!

137
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,082
Do you have children, Ramira?

138
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,566
No, not yet.

139
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,877
Are you single?
I might have a chance.

140
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm sorry, you're too late.
I'm married.

141
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:14,005
You see? I can't do anything right.
My life is crap.

142
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,237
- Don't exaggerate.
- Look at me.

143
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,124
A woman like you comes into my life
and I haven't got a chance.

144
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,198
- Please, bring my pills.
- Your pills?

145
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,039
They're in my sister's room.
Bring all you can.

146
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,358
Ofelia, I told you
I can't feel anything.

147
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,881
A fairy!

148
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,203
I'll go and get your pills.

149
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:36,722
The ones with the skull
on the bottle.

150
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,522
You're beautiful.
Who are you?

151
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm a fairy, dear child.

152
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:54,879
Great! Why are you here?

153
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,562
I'm on an important mission
from a wonderful fantasy world.

154
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,365
Do you want to help me?

155
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,683
No.

156
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:08,796
Fucking bitch!

157
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,320
Monster!

158
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:10,964
Fuck!

159
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,316
Come here.

160
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:27,681
Now I'm going to introduce you
to your roommates.

161
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:33,245
Do whatever she says.
She's a fucking wacko.

162
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:40,361
Really, Pedro...

163
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,597
What an interesting life
you've had.

164
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,280
And there's plenty more to come.

165
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,838
Pedro, say something.
You were so talkative

166
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:49,759
only a minute ago.

167
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,282
Pedro.

168
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,356
Pedro.

169
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:55,482
Pedro!

170
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:58,002
Another one went and died on me!

171
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:58,917
Raimunda?

172
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,442
I can't find Simeon anywhere.

173
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,518
I'm starting to worry.

174
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:06,995
Rigoberta?

175
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:13,523
Segismunda,

176
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:14,881
open the door!

177
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:21,720
Don't die on me!
My schedule is already full today!

178
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,480
Get up!

179
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:25,806
Open the door!

180
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:34,837
Filomena,

181
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:36,122
open the door!

182
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,562
What's going on?
What is this, a nightclub?

183
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:48,560
You're alive!
Thank God.

184
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,842
Holy shit!

185
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:51,725
I mean... jeepers.

186
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:55,280
I almost made it. I saw the light
in the tunnel and everything.

187
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,961
- What's going on here?
- He tried to kill himself!

188
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,879
Not that nonsense again!

189
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,045
Ignore him, he's a fraud.

190
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:05,397
Come on,

191
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,717
let's look for the boy.

192
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:22,962
<i>If my heart...</i>

193
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,081
<i>If my heart...</i>

194
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:28,681
<i>... ever beats again.</i>

195
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,156
<i>... ever beats again.</i>

196
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:34,319
<i>I promise that it will...</i>

197
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:37,759
<i>You can count on it.</i>

198
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:43,565
<i>... with you.</i>

199
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:49,801
Okay, listen up.

200
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:53,516
Your voice is better than yesterday.
But you, fairy.

201
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,917
Your choreography is awful.
Even so,

202
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,362
you touched my heart.
So I'll only fry

203
00:14:58,527 --> 00:14:59,277
one of you.

204
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,318
Salutations, small mortal.

205
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,523
I see you've met my fairy.

206
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,359
Damn, you're ugly.

207
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:11,041
Watch out, master!
Beware! This girl is...

208
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,037
Who are you?

209
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,277
I have many names.
Old names.

210
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:21,644
Some call me Faun, others Pan,
others Goatpussy...

211
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:25,641
You look like a cross
between a shepherd and a goat.

212
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,006
- I need your help...
- Those noises.

213
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,395
Is that with your mouth?

214
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:30,716
Noises? What noises?

215
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:32,919
I have a message
from the future for...

216
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,442
That shake is cool.
Do it again.

217
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,244
Take me to Pedro San...

218
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:39,726
The shake. Do it again!

219
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,836
Let's stay focused,
nasty little one.

220
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,965
You have to take me
to Pedro San Anton...

221
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,202
What's that?

222
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,925
A talking goat.
Can I keep it?

223
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,998
If it doesn't crap on the floor.

224
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,477
Have you seen your brother around?
I can't find him anywhere.

225
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,160
Did you look in that little door?

226
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,238
He can't be far.
He'll turn up.

227
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,523
- Back off, fat ass!
- Ofendia!

228
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:08,722
Pay her no mind.

229
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:10,240
Your rear end is...

230
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,925
larger than a moment ago?

231
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,078
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:18,959
It's a very serious disease.

233
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:22,642
I've had several biographies done on me
and they say it's degenerative.

234
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:25,607
Your ass starts to swell

235
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,241
until it bursts.

236
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,761
Great.

237
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,161
And you die.

238
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,362
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,600
Holy shit, how lucky!

240
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,962
- I mean... jeepers.
- It's no big deal.

241
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,321
We're all dead anyway.

242
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,159
I told you not to say those things.

243
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:43,718
Mom, none of this is real.
We're all dead. You, me, Simeon...

244
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:45,639
Nobody here is dead,
especially your brother.

245
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,286
Well, he might be, right?

246
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:48,323
Who knows?

247
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:51,684
Maybe he just burst into flames
for no reason.

248
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:55,840
It happens. Plenty of people
die like that. Why don't you

249
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:57,326
- take a valium?
- Why don't you shut up?

250
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:59,240
- I don't know.
- And find my son.

251
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:00,999
It's his bedtime.

252
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,442
Okay.

253
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,920
Filthy mutt!

254
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:34,402
<i>Antonio!</i>

255
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,641
Hi.

256
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,877
Are you lounging on the sofa
as usual?

257
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:43,199
No, I'm just walking in the door.

258
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,404
I was out looking
for really hard work.

259
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,843
Liar! I'm watching you
on the split screen.

260
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:52,717
Look at me when I talk to you,
damn it!

261
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,880
Where are you?

262
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:57,242
Here, Antonio!

263
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,725
Honey, I'm in big trouble

264
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:05,321
and I need your help
or I'll get fired.

265
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:09,196
Call Jose and offer him
50 euros for a job.

266
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,161
Okay.

267
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:18,245
You really hammered me.
Did you break my horn?

268
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:21,319
- No, your horn is fine.
- Who am I again?

269
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,639
Jeeves. I'm the princess
and you're Jeeves, my butler.

270
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,719
I recall something about a mission
and being a faun...

271
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,959
Exactly. Your mission is to do
anything I say.

272
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,719
Next time you must address me

273
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:36,084
as your royal Highness
and bow at my feet.

274
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,556
I don't know if I can remember
all that.

275
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,683
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

276
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,995
Thank you, Jose.
You're a lifesaver.

277
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,886
Now lie down
and pretend you're asleep.

278
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,002
Did you find Simeon?

279
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:55,723
Yes, yes.

280
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,525
What an angel.
I just tucked him in.

281
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,006
Good. I'll say good night.

282
00:18:59,167 --> 00:18:59,644
No!

283
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,200
No, leave him alone.

284
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,997
I mean, boys his age...

285
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:08,397
need a little more intimacy.

286
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,558
Intimacy?
How revolting!

287
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:14,482
At times like these
I miss my husband the most...

288
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,877
But he's not here.
So I'll have to talk to him myself.

289
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,483
Would you please step aside?

290
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,321
Simeon?

291
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,801
Simeon, sweetheart.
What are you doing?

292
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:38,682
Simeon.

293
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:42,524
Have I ever told you
about the birds and the bees?

294
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:43,961
It's a beautiful story.

295
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,477
Like when you were conceived.

296
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:49,122
It was so lovely, so beautiful.

297
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:52,367
Your father and I met
in a roadside bar.

298
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,563
I'd had a few cocktails.

299
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:58,403
Only fifteen or twenty.
And your father got a little

300
00:19:58,567 --> 00:19:59,716
naughty.

301
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,922
I felt dizzy
and went to the bathroom.

302
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,761
He followed me
and grabbed me from behind,

303
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:09,920
propped me up against the wall
and wham, bam!

304
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:11,679
He humped my brains out.

305
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:15,522
But it was very tender,
very sweet.

306
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,286
Then he did me doggie-style

307
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,435
while he fondled my perky breasts.

308
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,757
Wham, bam!

309
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:27,637
In and out, on top, from behind...
And without lubricant!

310
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:35,238
And the result
of that night's <i>love....</i>

311
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:36,875
you.

312
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,646
Look at you now.

313
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,158
You remind me so much
of your father.

314
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:44,799
With that... scratchy beard.

315
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:47,444
What are you hiding in there?

316
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,682
What is this?

317
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:51,958
Playing with the flashlight again?

318
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,120
Oh my God!

319
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:57,086
Have I ever told you the story...

320
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,600
....about the old lighthouse?

321
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:14,198
It hasn't worked for years,
but you want to hear a secret?

322
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,927
They say it has an invisible light
that protects us all.

323
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,883
Now say your prayers
and go to sleep.

324
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:25,520
Ouch!

325
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:45,002
Make yourself at home.

326
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,200
Is this how poor people live?

327
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,517
We can't all have a mansion
like your mom's.

328
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:51,120
Why not move in with us?

329
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,396
Silly girl.

330
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:56,282
I can't. Who would take care
of my Antonio?

331
00:22:56,447 --> 00:23:00,599
- Has he got your number?
- My number? No, no.

332
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:04,203
We're too poor.
I don't have a cell phone.

333
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,517
No, I mean like you
and my uncle San Anton.

334
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,882
You like each other.
I can tell.

335
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:11,286
What are you?

336
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:16,444
I love my husband, that's why
I married him. "Till death do us part."

337
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:20,395
That's how we'll do it then.
Till death does you part.

338
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:28,841
<i>Where is my man?</i>

339
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:32,601
<i>My brave swordsman.</i>

340
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:38,237
<i>I'm waiting for you,</i>
<i>you're a sex machine.</i>

341
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:42,877
Hello.

342
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:46,000
Can I help you, ma'am?

343
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:49,318
Of course you can help me.
I'm...

344
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:52,086
Excuse me.

345
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:58,316
No, I said quicklime. Quicklime.
Thank you.

346
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:03,759
Maligna Escobero,
from the Department of <i>Rare....</i>

347
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,282
Diseases.

348
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:07,958
How may I be of service?

349
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:11,756
Where's Simeon?
May I please see him?

350
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:14,158
I don't know.
Playing somewhere, I guess.

351
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,566
"Playing <i>somewhere.''</i>

352
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:17,876
<i>Negligent fucking putz.</i>

353
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,639
Why do you want to see Simeon?

354
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:21,638
It's all right, I'll serve myself.

355
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:25,164
We've found out that there may be
a cure for his rare...

356
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:28,125
disease. And I have to ask him
these questions. For example:

357
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,396
Do you think the boy
would fit in this sack?

358
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,159
Does Simeon scream a lot?

359
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:35,479
Hold your cup closer, dear.

360
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:39,881
Children

361
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,275
are so naive,

362
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,516
so easy to deceive.

363
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:45,042

00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:48,797

His disease makes him especially

365
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:51,083

00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,604

369
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:02,517
His soft skin slowly sizzling,
with tiny bubbles of pus bursting,

370
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,962
screaming in pain...

371
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:07,555
Who are you?

372
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,396
Leave this house this instant
or I'm calling the police.

373
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,241
I...

374
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:15,082

00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,362
Hello?

379
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:31,521

00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:21,435

Another Spanish movie!
Is Antonio getting home soon?

405
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:01,405
I don't think so. He's looking for
work, the poor thing.

406
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,559
He's a sweetheart. You'll see when
you meet him. Such a hard worker.

407

That's enough, okay, Antonio?
That's enough.

00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,241
That's enough!

415
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:58,565
Ofendia, I lied.
My husband is a bum.

416
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,524
He's a couch potato.

417
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,359
He moves less than
your uncle San Anton.

418
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,164
What a temper!

419
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:08,558
I let her talk and shout

420
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:11,480
to get it out of her system,
you know?

421
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:15,962
Because I'm the one who wears
the pants in this family.

422
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:18,358
Oh, yeah?
You don't look like it.

423
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:19,996
You want proof?

424
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,316
Yeah, because I don't believe it.

425
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:30,162
Ramira!

426
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:33,356
My lunch!

427
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:36,041
Right now, I'm hungry!

428
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:41,324
You call that wearing the pants?

429
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:43,201
Ramira...

430
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:44,961
This is bullshit.

431
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:49,367
I'm the boss around here.

432
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:54,078
Either make me another plate
of spaghetti like this one...

433
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:57,598
or I'll...

434
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:01,157
or I'll smack you upside the head!

435
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:12,204
Ramira, I quit!
That house gives me the creeps!

436
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:17,882
Good! Now you and my uncle San Anton
can get married.

00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:07,403
Pedro!

450
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:08,966
What is it, Ramira?

451
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:10,799
- I killed my husband.
- Then why?

452
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,195
Actually, I'm not sure.

453
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,880
Then why won't you kill me?

454
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,560
Squeeze tighter.

455
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:20,799
Squeeze, that's it.

456
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,601
I can hardly breathe.
That's it, tighter...

457
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,200
Holy shit!
I mean... jeepers.

458
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,436
I can't do it.

459
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,282
Why not? You're going to jail
anyway. What's another cadaver?

460
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:34,325
I can't do this to you.
You're the person I trust most.

461
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:38,520
Does that mean I might have a chance
with you? Since you're <i>free....</i>

462
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:42,926
- What's going on here?
- Ma'am, I've done something horrible.

463
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:46,921
I know, I was eavesdropping
behind the door. Paca,

464
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,562
you have our support.
We'll even turn you in

465
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:53,436
to the police if you want.
I'll pay for the call myself.

466
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:54,835
What are you talking about?

467
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:57,475
Ramira has to hide here with us
until things calm down.

468
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:01,526
And if she feels homicidal again,
great. She's like one of the family.

469
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:04,440
I hadn't considered

470
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,916
staying but since you asked...

471
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:08,645
That's very kind of you.

472
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:11,241
I'll treat the girl
like my own daughter.

473
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:12,123
And the boy?

474
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:15,403
Of course, and the boy too.

475
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:19,082
Get ready. Today's his birthday
and we're having a party later.

476
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:20,726
It's the boy's birthday?

477
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:23,876
That's great!

478
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:32,681
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIMEON

479
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,486
Isn't this great?

480
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,036
This is the best birthday party
I've ever been to.

481
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:45,605
I'll start cleaning up.

482
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:48,201
What? My son hasn't
even shown up yet.

483
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,403
Where could he be?

484
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,886
I'm starting to worry.

485
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:55,596
Mom, can I keep the presents
if Simeon doesn't show?

486
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,803
Those presents
belong to your brother!

487
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,879
Look at this suit I got him

488
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:02,163
for UVA protection.

489
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:06,241
Go find him and tell him
to get in here.

490
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,118
I could swear I saw him earlier
eating potato chips.

491
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:11,800
Chips? What chips?

492
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,366
There aren't any left.

493
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:15,165
Where? I looked and couldn't...

494
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:17,716
Shut up! I heard a noise.

495
00:32:18,007 --> 00:32:18,757
Simeon?

496
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:21,315
Simeon, is that you?

497
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,922
Poor thing, you made yourself
a shabby little suit

498
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:28,679
for sun protection.

499
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,598
Here, put this one on.
It's much nicer.

500
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:34,482
Simeon?

501
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:36,956
Simeon...

502
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:50,082
Simeon?

503
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:52,795
Simeon, I heard you.
Where are you?

504
00:32:57,287 --> 00:32:58,402
Simeon?

505
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:02,076
Simeon?

506
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:04,761
You don't like the suit
I got you?

507
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:07,760
It cost a fortune,
but we can exchange it.

508
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:09,042
I think I have the receipt.

509
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,247
Poor thing. What's wrong?

510
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:14,678
What?

511
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:52,366
We're recording!

512
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:55,438
Angela. Angela, damn it!

513
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:56,562
What?

514
00:33:57,047 --> 00:33:58,799
- There's something hanging...
- What?

515
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:01,043
- You have something.
- My hair? Okay?

516
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,720
- Right, your hair.
- Okay.

517
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,565
- Ready?
- Okay.

518
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:07,717
Good evening. This is Angela Vidal,

519
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:11,243
reporting from outside the bathroom door
where a woman has apparently...

520
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:15,879
- Holy shit!
- She's a zombie!

521
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,759
Living dead, a freak of nature!

522
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:19,724
- Keep recording!
- Run!

523
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:28,527
Get this on fucking tape!

524
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,798
I swear I saw him.

525
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:38,604
I saw him.

526
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:39,597
- You did?
- Yes.

527
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,479
He had a sack over his head
and he did this:

528
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:48,123
My little Santiago
means the world to me.

529
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,363
Simeon.

530
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:52,724
Right, Simeon. My darling...

531
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:05,805
I was wondering, maybe...

532
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:09,204
somebody new might
have entered the house,

533
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,119
someone who didn't know
about his illness,

534
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:14,245
and by mistake
and with the best intentions,

535
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:18,400
even trying to do the kid a favor,
because he looked as pale as a ghost,

536
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,478
taken the boy outside
without knowing.

537
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:24,481
Yeah? Who? Who would commit
such an atrocity?

538
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:27,605
Who could be so sick, so degenerate,

539
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:28,597
- so inhumane...
- Me?

540
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,281
I got it!
Maligna Escobero.

541
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:33,524
A very suspicious woman.

542
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,121
So suspicious I could crap myself.

543
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:37,959
She came around yesterday
asking about Sergio.

544
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:39,845
- Simeon.
- Right, Simeon.

545
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:43,756
My prince. It was her, I know it.
I can feel it.

546
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:45,242
I can smell it.

547
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:47,159
Sorry. That was me.

548
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:49,480
Wherever you are,

549
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,322
I'll search sky and land,
cross valleys and mountains...

550
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,239
- What is it?
- That's not Simeon.

551
00:35:57,287 --> 00:35:59,642
We always kept the house so dark...

552
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:04,640
This is all my fault.

553
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:05,922
Ramira.

554
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,279
Look what the little brat
did to my hand. Help me out.

555
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:12,918
Oh, Pedro.
You're such a good listener.

556
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:15,436
Of course I am.
Since I can't go anywhere...

557
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,679
- I've done an awful thing.
- We all do awful things.

558
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:21,566
You don't understand.
There's something you don't know.

559
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:24,287
I don't want to know.
It's better to forget some things.

560
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,597
Take me, for example.
The past did this to me.

561
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,362
I'm sure it's a nice story.
But what I meant to say is

562
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,916
- what actually happened to Simeon...
- Yes, it is a nice story.

563
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:36,364
Between nice and shitty.
I'll tell you in a flashback,

564
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,721
it's better.

565
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:45,276
I was young, handsome
and had a great head of hair.

566
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:49,845
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

567
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,838
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

568
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:57,284
<i>I was cruel and ruthless,</i>
<i>obsessed with my perfect body.</i>

569
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:58,886
<i>I didn't like what I saw</i>

570
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,765
<i>in the mirror every morning.</i>

571
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:08,046
<i>Did I mention I had great hair?</i>
<i>It's worth remembering.</i>

572
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:10,319
<i>Lord have mercy, did I ever.</i>

573
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:15,561
<i>My life was a series of atrocities.</i>

574
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,606
<i>Violence, pain...</i>

575
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:27,236
<i>So I hit the street,</i>
<i>ready to do my job.</i>

576
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,157
<i>It wasn't very pleasant.</i>

577
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:42,602
<i>Primarily because</i>
<i>I was a homicidal psychopath.</i>

578
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:48,964
<i>There was something strange</i>
<i>in the air that day.</i>

579
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,246
<i>Where was everyone?</i>

580
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,438
<i>I walked the streets</i>
<i>like anybody else.</i>

581
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,883
<i>Nobody, absolutely nobody</i>
<i>knew how cruel I was.</i>

582
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:01,925
<i>But that day my instinct told me</i>

583
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:03,236
<i>something wasn't right.</i>

584
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,163
<i>I was engulfed with rage</i>

585
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,282
<i>and I lost control.</i>

586
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:26,636
<i>And, well, those were the last steps</i>
<i>I ever took.</i>

587
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,798
Where are you? Where?

588
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,959
I swear I'll find you
and I'll kill you all!

589
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,077
I said left!
Traffic light! Pedestrian!

590
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:40,807
- We're fucked, Luis!
- Start the car, Carlos!

591
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:44,446
I've been confined to this bed
ever since.

592
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:48,004
Well, Pedro. I hope things
don't get any worse.

593
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:50,602
I'm here to love
and care for you.

594
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,917
Thanks, Ramira.
But you know what I want.

595
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:55,362
Oh, Pedro.
I've had enough killing.

596
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:58,325
Don't worry, I'll help you get
your zest for life back.

597
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:00,637
I have happiness in my jeans!

598
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:04,760
Marrying you would sure bring back
my zest for life.

599
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:16,363
Sorry, I woke up starving.

600
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,082
It's coming from over there,
from the window.

601
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:28,002
It's outside. It's him.

602
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,123
He's in the fog!

603
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:38,364
Serafin!
Mommy's coming for you!

604
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:43,197
Serafin! Santiago! Sergio!

605
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,476
Little boy!

606
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:06,960
Hey, how much are you charging
for those pills?

607
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:12,245
Shit, Danny. I already took thirty.
I'm sleepy already.

608
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:14,997
- I'm outta here.
- Juani, so soon?

609
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,486
I'm coming with you!

610
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:22,721
Who's there?

611
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:26,521
Is it you, Diego?

612
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,641
My hero?

613
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:40,076
Diego! What has the war
done to you?

614
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:41,601
It fucked me up.

615
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,246
I don't care.

616
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:46,041
I'm so glad you're alive.
I thought I'd never

617
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:47,481
touch you again...

618
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:48,796
or hold you or feel

619
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:49,956
your touch.

620
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,682
Take it easy, baby.
Let me rest.

621
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:54,166
You'll get yours later.

622
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:56,636
Bullshit! Heat me up, Diego!
Now!

623
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:58,566
We'll make love for hours.

624
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,160
Come on, take me!

625
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,962
Come on! <i>Fuck me! Fuck me!</i>
Faster!

626
00:42:04,447 --> 00:42:06,199
I was at war, not playing bingo!

627
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:09,962
I'm already lubricated!
You're all skin and bones!

628
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,925
I don't know if I can find it
with all this fog.

629
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:15,476
Come on, big boy!
Faster!

630
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:16,841
Faster!

631
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:20,359
Careful, you'll wake the children.

632
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:22,120
Diego, my head!

633
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:38,115
Holy shit! Is this a hat
or a fucking boomerang?

634
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:39,997
Yes!

635
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:45,115
- My love warrior!
- No comment.

636
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:53,637
There's so much I have to tell you.

637
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:55,399
Me too.

638
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,763
- Our son, Siegfried...
- Simeon.

639
00:42:57,927 --> 00:43:00,680
Right. The boy has disappeared.

640
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:03,884
And I can't take it anymore.
Because our son

641
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:07,323
isn't the brightest of the bunch.
Are you listening to me,

642
00:43:07,487 --> 00:43:08,442
Diego?

643
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:11,440
Girl, the war made me do things
I ain't proud of.

644
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:13,884
I've been through it all.

645
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:16,203
Let me start from the beginning.

646
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:20,323
It was the year 1625.

647
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:23,565
The Count-Duke of Olivares
commanded the men of Flanders

648
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:26,195
and I was given a dangerous mission:

649
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:28,676
To challenge a mysterious
swordsman to a duel.

650
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:31,725
He had a beard.
He was a real sweetheart.

651
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:36,156
I killed him, but he had
powerful friends in the shadows...

652
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:40,036
So there I was with Quevedo, who by
the way is fatter than <i>ever....</i>

653
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:42,721
And another mysterious swordsman
comes after me.

654
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:45,999
Hey, I'm talking to you!

655
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,239
Yeah, right. The swordsman.
Unbelievable.

656
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:53,326
You're here, that's all that matters.
I'll never let you leave again.

657
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:55,045
Actually, that's what I wanted

658
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:56,560
- to talk to you about.
- No.

659
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:58,519
Don't you see how long
I've been

660
00:43:58,687 --> 00:44:01,918
alone? Every night I prayed
that you were okay,

661
00:44:02,087 --> 00:44:03,725
that you'd come back.

662
00:44:03,887 --> 00:44:06,640
By the way, you look awful,
but I love you anyway.

663
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:08,081
And now that you're here...

664
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:10,602
<i>I live for your kisses,</i>

665
00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:12,918
<i>your thankless smile.</i>

666
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:15,766
<i>Your beautiful caresses,</i>

667
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:18,521
<i>the joy you bring me.</i>

668
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:21,162
<i>That you won't let me down,</i>

669
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:24,399
<i>that you'll never leave me.</i>

670
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:26,603
<i>Lying here in bed,</i>

671
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:29,804
<i>I've never needed you more.</i>

672
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,117
<i>I'm the one waiting for you.</i>

673
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:34,801
<i>I'm the one weeping for you.</i>

674
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,401
<i>I'm the one longing for you.</i>

675
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:40,001
<i>Every minute, every hour.</i>

676
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,965
<i>I'm dying to kiss you,</i>

677
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:45,561
<i>to kiss you all night long.</i>

678
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:48,287
<i>I'm dying to tell you</i>

679
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:50,915
<i>that the world is wrong.</i>

680
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:53,681
<i>I'm dying to kiss you,</i>

681
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:56,202
<i>to kiss you all night long.</i>

682
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:59,086
<i>I'm dying to tell you</i>

683
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:01,761
<i>that the world is wrong.</i>

684
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:04,839
<i>The world is wrong!</i>

685
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:10,523
<i>The world is wrong!</i>

686
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:24,240
That song was pretty fucking cheesy!

687
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,081
At least the lyrics were true,

688
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:28,726
- unlike yours.
- What?

689
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:31,355
"I'm 7 times as strong as you? "
Bullshit.

690
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,165
- I was.
- Oh, yeah?

691
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:36,239
You were 7 times stronger
than a guy who weighed 200 pounds?

692
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:38,518
- In proportion.
- Oh, in proportion!

693
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,836
You should have said so!

694
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:43,602
<i>"I'm 7 times as strong as you, in</i>
<i>proportion."</i> Then you're not lying.

695
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:46,122
Get off my case!
Picky, picky!

696
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:49,480
That cap of yours is a disgrace.

697
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:50,875
"We're Smurfs! "

698
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:53,481
Give yourselves a last name!
Jerk!

699
00:45:53,647 --> 00:45:56,844
Well, well.
How's that for grumpy?

700
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,246
Diego.

701
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,761
Diego...

702
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,242
Diego?

703
00:46:15,967 --> 00:46:18,845
<i>Girl, I'm leaving you.</i>
<i>I'm in bad shape.</i>

704
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:22,165
<i>The war was a lonely place</i>
<i>for a man...</i>

705
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,598
<i>I made friends with</i>
<i>Alfrodo and Samti,</i>

706
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,759
<i>two really friendly midgets</i>
<i>with hairy legs.</i>

707
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:32,761
<i>They told me about the ring's power</i>
<i>and one thing led to another...</i>

708
00:46:32,927 --> 00:46:33,916
That's impossible!

709
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:35,315
<i>Yes, it is possible.</i>

710
00:46:35,487 --> 00:46:38,081
<i>Amazingly, what's in the photo</i>
<i>can be done.</i>

711
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,520
<i>Hobbits are incredibly flexible.</i>

712
00:46:52,967 --> 00:46:54,446
I have something important
to tell you.

713
00:46:54,607 --> 00:46:56,563
- Did you kill someone else?
- Yes.

714
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,922
I mean, no.
No, for God's sake.

715
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:00,315
It's something else.

716
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,405
I want you to know how grateful I am
you took me in.

717
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:05,398
Will you do anything for me?

718
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:07,159
Of course.

719
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,806
Then marry me.
Or kill me.

720
00:47:09,487 --> 00:47:10,715
Here we go again!

721
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:13,082
- Pedro, why?
- You know why, Ramira.

722
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,124
Look at my hand.

723
00:47:15,287 --> 00:47:17,881
Only inches away from yours.

724
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:19,675
Well, not now.

725
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,315
Okay, there.

726
00:47:21,607 --> 00:47:25,316
For me, this is an impossible
distance. A chimera.

727
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:27,682
You see?

728
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:29,879
She was right. You can move.

729
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:33,798
- She said she saw you sleepwalking.
- I don't believe that.

730
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:37,916
If it were true,
you and I could leave tonight,

731
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:39,202
together,

732
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:41,363
galloping naked on a lively steed,

733
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:45,440
our bodies rubbing against each other
as we penetrate the Galician steppe,

734
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:48,561
your breasts and the horse
bouncing in unison...

735
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:56,795
But I can't leave my sister
at a time like this,

736
00:47:56,967 --> 00:47:59,686
destroyed by Simeon's disappearance.
Little Simeon.

737
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:01,956
That's right.

738
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:04,318
Maybe I could help find him.

739
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:06,525
- You? How?
- My mom knows

740
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:09,155
a woman with powers in my village.

741
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:12,637
She predicts stuff, sees dead people,
opens walnuts with her ass...

742
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,763
- Can she contact missing people?
- Yeah.

743
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:16,645
She talks to Joan the Mad

744
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:18,001
- on the Ouija board.
- We must find her.

745
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,600
It's impossible.

746
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:22,156
Her husband was Philip the Handsome.
He died centuries ago.

747
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:25,397
No, I mean the woman
who contacts missing people.

748
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:27,956
Oh, her. Of course.

749
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:31,599
Tomorrow we'll go to my village
and fix this whole mess.

750
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,519
We'll find Simeon, you'll see.

751
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:35,799
Alive, dead,

752
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:38,318
in chunks of charred flesh...

753
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:48,157
TYPICAL ALMODOVARIAN VILLAGE

754
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:02,361
<i>To return...</i>

755
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,077
<i>wrinkled by age,</i>

756
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:12,478
<i>my face made silver</i>
<i>by the snows of time.</i>

757
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,722
<i>To feel...</i>

758
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,683
<i>life is but a gasp,</i>

759
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:22,124
<i>20 years is nothing,</i>

760
00:49:22,287 --> 00:49:26,758
<i>a feverish gaze, wandering the</i>
<i>shadows, calling out your name.</i>

761
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:28,799
<i>To live...</i>

762
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:32,084
<i>clutching your soul...</i>

763
00:49:32,247 --> 00:49:33,646
Hands off, father!

764
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:46,482
That woman!

765
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:48,315
It's her!

766
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,443
It's Maligna!

767
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:52,603
Maligna!

768
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:00,526
No!

769
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:16,675
No!

770
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:26,958
<i>Hit the brakes, damn it!</i>
<i>We hit an old lady! I said left!</i>

771
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:30,085
- <i>My left or your left?</i>
- <i>You're clueless! Let me out!</i>

772
00:50:32,807 --> 00:50:34,240
Please, step back!

773
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:37,080
Step back, please!

774
00:50:38,447 --> 00:50:39,766
Okay, where's the marble?

775
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,642
You're looking confused.
Lady, please.

776
00:50:43,447 --> 00:50:45,881
Excuse me, did you see
an old woman get run over?

777
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:47,845
Yeah, over there.

778
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,163
The lady likes to gamble.

779
00:50:57,887 --> 00:50:59,320
Is there a doctor in the house?

780
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:01,205
Help me!

781
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:03,318
- Help me!
- A doctor?

782
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:07,960
Is there a doctor in the house?

783
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:10,641
Is there a doctor in the house?

784
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:12,885
You! You're a doctor!

785
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:14,639
What makes you say that?

786
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:16,320
Please hurry!

787
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:20,602
Do something, please!

788
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:25,286
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
They say I'm a doctor.

789
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:33,959
Anybody got a defibrillator?

790
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:56,246
Excuse me, sorry.

791
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:04,275
I think she's dead.

792
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:14,962
Oh my God!

793
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,484
Girlfriend, look who's here!
Make yourselves comfortable.

794
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:43,400
Not you, you're stiffer
than Stonehenge!

795
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:47,403
Forgive the mess,
my cleaning lady hasn't come.

796
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:49,155
Because she drinks.

797
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:50,721
Out of the closet?

798
00:52:50,887 --> 00:52:52,684
Try out of the minibar!

799
00:52:53,447 --> 00:52:55,119
What was I going to tell you?

800
00:52:55,287 --> 00:52:58,359
Oh, yeah. You were right.

801
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,005
Maligna Escobero was dangerous.

802
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:05,319
We'd been after her for a while.
We searched her house

803
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:07,364
and look what we found.

804
00:53:08,847 --> 00:53:10,200
- God!
- You said it.

805
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:15,524
Back in the 80's she was a
celebrity. An icon.

806
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:19,446
Take a look at her record.

807
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:24,281
Maligna was Horace Hedgehog.

808
00:53:24,927 --> 00:53:26,121
Apparently

809
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:30,326
she got sick of the monotony and decided
to go with a more modern look.

810
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:33,763
But the kids
didn't accept the change

811
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:36,236
and her show got cancelled.

812
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:38,518
She went downhill from there.

813
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,838
She did her best to find work,

814
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:46,724
but the city can be especially hard
on a seven-foot hedgehog.

815
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:49,481
Eventually, insane and drunk,

816
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,599
she decided to kidnap children

817
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,086
for revenge.

818
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:54,600
Oh my God!
My poor Samuel!

819
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:55,438
Simeon.

820
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,596
- Right.
- But no.

821
00:53:57,687 --> 00:54:00,201
Maligna didn't kidnap your son.

822
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:02,444
The day he disappeared

823
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:04,525
there was a bank robbery.

824
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:10,518
We'd lost her trail since then,
until today.

825
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,681
We can all celebrate.
She's dead.

826
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:16,805
How about a cocktail, sunshine?

827
00:54:17,807 --> 00:54:19,399
Is my son alive or dead?

828
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:20,443
Dead.

829
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:23,365
I'm just kidding, silly!

830
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't know and I don't care.

831
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:27,203
That's out of my jurisdiction.

832
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:30,882
Ramira, let's find that friend of
your mother's. That's all we can do.

833
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:35,276
Who taped "Cockeye the Sailor"?

834
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:54,367
This isn't for kicks,
it's for my disease.

835
00:54:58,327 --> 00:54:59,203
Agustica,

836
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:00,277
will Mom be long?

837
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:02,523
I don't think so.
She usually appears

838
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:03,676
at this hour!

839
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:09,602
Act like you can't see her.
She thinks she's a ghost.

840
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:17,596
Somebody farted.

841
00:55:19,087 --> 00:55:21,282
Mother!
Ramira has come to ask you

842
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:22,766
about your medium.

843
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:26,442
Incredible!

844
00:55:26,607 --> 00:55:27,722
A flying glass.

845
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:29,240
Is that you, Mom?

846
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:32,646
Yes, Ramira, my daughter.

847
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:35,116
- I'm your mother.
- Hi, Mom.

848
00:55:35,287 --> 00:55:37,482
Why have you come home?

849
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:40,320
I need your medium's phone number.

850
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:46,276
Fuck!

851
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:57,085
This is all so paranormal.

852
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:01,477
I need you to help me
find my son.

853
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,876
This is her number.

854
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,244
Damn, this pen doesn't work.

855
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:14,762
Another one.

856
00:56:15,207 --> 00:56:17,198
Here it is.

857
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:18,881
Okay, catch you later.

858
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:21,123
Goodbye!

859
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:33,482
I feel a pwesence...

860
00:56:33,687 --> 00:56:34,961
What did she say?

861
00:56:35,927 --> 00:56:37,997
A vewy stwong pwesence.

862
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:39,886
We brought the wrong presents.

863
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:44,127
Babalan, tuwn on the stwobe light.

864
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,282
The what light?

865
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:48,642
The stwobe light, damn it!

866
00:56:48,807 --> 00:56:50,763
Oh, the disco light.

867
00:57:02,727 --> 00:57:03,955
In order to recreate

868
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:07,358
the spiritual ambience,
I will need absolute silence,

869
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,237
some pork grinds and a beer.

870
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:20,515
This lullaby will put Gerarda
in a trance

871
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,247
to enter into contact
with the missing.

872
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:34,200
I think that's it.

873
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:37,600
Gerarda.

874
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,639
Are you asleep?

875
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,075
Let's continue.

876
00:57:49,647 --> 00:57:53,356
If there is a presence
in this house,

877
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:54,961
let it appear...

878
00:57:56,447 --> 00:57:57,675
now.

879
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:09,921
It's moving by itself!

880
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:17,605
Has that ever happened before?

881
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:21,196
My husband
used to do the same thing.

882
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:22,720
There is clearly

883
00:58:22,887 --> 00:58:24,878
a very strong presence here.

884
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:35,846
And raunchy too.

885
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:39,241
Gerarda, you can open your eyes now.

886
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:43,246
<i>I feel a presence around me.</i>

887
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,841
She's in the corridor...

888
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:01,762
Heading for that door.

889
00:59:02,687 --> 00:59:04,405
Ask her if she sees my son.

890
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:06,961
<i>There's something here.</i>

891
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:09,162
<i>Screams.</i>

892
00:59:10,487 --> 00:59:11,966
<i>Suffering.</i>

893
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:33,997
Gerarda.

894
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:36,123
Gerarda!

895
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,679
I think we've lost contact.

896
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:40,759
This doesn't seem to be working.

897
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:49,123
You can't just leave like this!
Gerarda, what can I do?

898
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:52,359
When awful things happen,
sometimes they leave a print.

899
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:55,883
Like an echo that wants to be heard.

900
00:59:56,447 --> 00:59:57,436
I don't understand.

901
00:59:59,727 --> 01:00:01,365
You hear but you do not listen.

902
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:02,960
Hear what?
Listen to what?

903
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:07,803
It's not seeing is believing, it's
believing is smelling. No, wait.

904
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,725
You must believe what you see.

905
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:12,115
No, wait.

906
01:00:12,287 --> 01:00:15,245
I see, I believe, I listen,
I look...

907
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:16,563
Can I touch too?

908
01:00:18,607 --> 01:00:19,722
I got it!

909
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:21,764
Not believing is seeing,

910
01:00:21,927 --> 01:00:24,521
but knowing is growing.

911
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,120
Maybe it's the other way around.

912
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:28,164
Women believe anything.

913
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:30,124
Stuff like "rejuvenating cream"

914
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:31,640
and "just the tip"...

915
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:34,164
For now just believe
and later we'll see.

916
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:38,764
Come on, Babalan.
Let's get out of here.

917
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,121
What a pain!

918
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:41,800
Hey, wait a minute!

919
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:44,276
I'm stuck!

920
01:00:45,287 --> 01:00:47,801
- No, no...
- Yes!

921
01:00:48,247 --> 01:00:50,317
- What's the problem?
- I'm sorry, Pedro. I can't.

922
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:53,999
Sure you can, it's easy.
It could have been over by now.

923
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,362
- Killing is like riding a bicycle.
- No!

924
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,757
- You said you'd help me.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

925
01:01:00,607 --> 01:01:02,563
If you can't make me happy
by loving me,

926
01:01:02,887 --> 01:01:04,320
do it by killing me.

927
01:01:04,487 --> 01:01:05,636
No way.

928
01:01:05,807 --> 01:01:08,241
I have everything ready.
All I need is a video camera.

929
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:16,564
Okay, look. I have a friend
who might be able to help.

930
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,003
My name is Pedro San Anton
and I'm about to die.

931
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:22,805
No! Cut! That was crap!

932
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:25,003
- Isn't that the line?
- Do it again!

933
01:01:29,047 --> 01:01:31,038
Final sequence, take one.

934
01:01:34,087 --> 01:01:36,555
- My name is <i>Pedro....</i>
- No, no! Cut!

935
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:39,520
It's too gloomy.
Let's spice it up a little.

936
01:01:40,487 --> 01:01:42,443
Are you recording this?

937
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:44,438
Okay, my name is Pedro San Anton...

938
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:47,600
Excuse me, could you speak up
a little bit?

939
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:51,077
We can't understand you.
Be natural, but shout.

940
01:01:51,247 --> 01:01:52,396
Okay? Let's go.

941
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:53,956
Okay.

942
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:57,358
My name is Pedro San Anton

943
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,995
and I'm going to kill myself
because my life sucks...

944
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:03,239
Cut! That was fucking crap!
Let's break for lunch.

945
01:02:08,927 --> 01:02:10,440
I want to <i>believe....</i>

946
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,446
and <i>see....</i>

947
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:15,197
and smell and touch and <i>sing....</i>

948
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:24,846
Son? Is that you?

949
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:47,437
Are you trying to tell me
something?

950
01:02:58,087 --> 01:02:59,600
- Take it easy.
- No, you take it easy.

951
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:01,280
- No, you take it easy.
- No, you take it easy.

952
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:03,642
- Who are you looking for?
- My son Simon. And you?

953
01:03:03,807 --> 01:03:06,879
My son Sergio... Siegfried...
My son too.

954
01:03:07,127 --> 01:03:09,243
- Good luck.
- You too.

955
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:13,436
PORN OUI

956
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:16,960
A pipe...

957
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:22,202
My gun. But where?

958
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:27,276
A pick?

959
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:31,085
What's a pick doing here?

960
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,164
Okay, boys. Thanks.

961
01:03:33,327 --> 01:03:35,795
I think our little show
kept him distracted.

962
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:39,243
By the way, the glass was great.
It looked like real cyanide.

963
01:03:39,407 --> 01:03:40,920
- What was it?
- Cyanide.

964
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:42,202
What?

965
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:53,961
Hey, handsome.

966
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:56,163
Help me and I'll do
anything you want.

967
01:03:58,487 --> 01:03:59,681
Pedro!

968
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:01,161
Pedro, no!

969
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:04,519
Thanks!
You saved my life!

970
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:09,804
I can't right now.
I have to find my master, the faun.

971
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,600
Shit! I can't fly!

972
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,602
Thanks, sugar.
We'll do it again sometime.

973
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:41,567
Though I couldn't find your...

974
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:55,401
Faster!
There's my master!

975
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:57,364
I'm not that kind of goat!

976
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:00,398
Master, please!
Try to remember!

977
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:01,522
I'm your fairy!

978
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:03,082
We have to continue

979
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:04,123
our mission!

980
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:08,159
Knock yourselves out!

981
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,117
Pedro, wait!

982
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:21,960
Keep it down, honey.

983
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:23,756
Pedro,

984
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:26,316
it's time for you
to abandon this world.

985
01:05:26,487 --> 01:05:27,966
- Great! When, now?
- Yes,

986
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:29,082
- now.
- It's about time.

987
01:05:29,247 --> 01:05:30,566
That's right, it's time.

988
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:31,603
Right now?

989
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:33,280
When your time is up,
it's up.

990
01:05:33,447 --> 01:05:35,165
- Then his time is up.
- Knock it off!

991
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:39,406
You have to go back
to the real world.

992
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:40,682
The real world?

993
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:42,599
You're imagining all this.

994
01:05:42,767 --> 01:05:45,042
- Then who am I?
- A hologram with tits.

995
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:48,838
But allow me to explain
in more appropriate surroundings.

996
01:05:53,207 --> 01:05:56,404
What's going on here?
Will somebody tell me the truth?

997
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:58,956
Holy shit!
I mean... jeepers.

998
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:00,680
The truth?

999
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:02,923
You can't handle the truth.

1000
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:07,602
This is all in your mind.
We're actually

1001
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:09,200
in the year 3028.

1002
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:11,961
The 20th century started out fine
but later got shitty.

1003
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:14,197
You had an accident
and decided to freeze yourself.

1004
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:15,322
You're in a coma now.

1005
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:17,478
But in the future we gave you new
arms, legs and buttocks.

1006
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:18,477
New hair?

1007
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:21,037
No, but if you want hair,
that's fine.

1008
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:22,686
Make it curly, please.

1009
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:27,206
We do straight hair better, but
fine. But you have to wake up.

1010
01:06:28,327 --> 01:06:29,476
I don't understand.

1011
01:06:29,647 --> 01:06:30,682
You must leave

1012
01:06:30,847 --> 01:06:32,360
this space-time
to return to the future.

1013
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:34,438
- I'm bored. I don't get it.
- Okay.

1014
01:06:34,607 --> 01:06:35,801
Pay attention.

1015
01:06:35,967 --> 01:06:38,117
This is the present.
We are here.

1016
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:39,925
- I'm lost.
- Just do as I say.

1017
01:06:40,087 --> 01:06:42,806
Jump off the building, kill yourself,
the coma is broken and you're all set.

1018
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:46,164
In the future you can run, dance,
moonwalk... and you have great hair.

1019
01:06:46,327 --> 01:06:48,397
Hold on, I was thinking...

1020
01:06:48,727 --> 01:06:51,241
If this is a dream,
this fucking sucks!

1021
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,160
I should be on a yacht
surrounded by chicks in bikinis.

1022
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:55,442
No, look.

1023
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:58,121
You chose the basic package.
It says so right here.

1024
01:06:58,287 --> 01:06:59,879
That's why you could move!

1025
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:01,720
I can't move.

1026
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:03,320
The cheaper package
can have errors.

1027
01:07:04,207 --> 01:07:07,005
Then everything
I've experienced here?

1028
01:07:08,447 --> 01:07:09,800
What about Ramira?

1029
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:15,038
You'll have to choose between Ramira
and that great head of hair.

1030
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:23,758
Curly hair.

1031
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:32,682
What is this?
What is this?

1032
01:07:33,847 --> 01:07:37,806
Mom, we all have problems.
I lost my butler Jeeves.

1033
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:40,925
They're mocking me.
They're playing with me.

1034
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:45,399
Think, Mom. Maybe this is what
Simeon wants. To play. What's that for?

1035
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:48,036
This? Take...

1036
01:07:48,687 --> 01:07:49,722
your pick?

1037
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:53,435
One, two, three, take your pick.

1038
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:05,238
One, two, three, take your pick.

1039
01:08:07,727 --> 01:08:09,718
Movies for three euros!

1040
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:13,925
One, two, three,
knock down the wall.

1041
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:21,961
One, two, three,
knock down the wall.

1042
01:08:28,927 --> 01:08:31,282
Simeon? Is that you?

1043
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,396
What do you mean?

1044
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:41,521
I don't understand.

1045
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:48,682
What? You want to play
movie charades?

1046
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,242
Two words?

1047
01:08:53,487 --> 01:08:54,966
Columbus!
Christopher Columbus!

1048
01:08:57,127 --> 01:08:58,321
Robot. A robot?

1049
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:03,363
A traffic cop?

1050
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:04,841
Dance...

1051
01:09:08,287 --> 01:09:11,120
What do you mean? I don't
understand. Give me a hint.

1052
01:09:15,287 --> 01:09:16,276
Where are you going?

1053
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:18,960
Where does this lead?

1054
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:39,043
Take this with you, Pedro.

1055
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:41,001
To remember me by.

1056
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:42,316
My egg.

1057
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:53,042
I don't mean to rush you, but...
How's that suicide coming?

1058
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:55,399
I'm not going to jump.

1059
01:09:55,967 --> 01:10:00,199
Ramira, I may never walk again,
but I've met someone wonderful here.

1060
01:10:01,247 --> 01:10:04,239
Ramira, I'm staying with you.
I love you!

1061
01:10:07,367 --> 01:10:10,200
Okay, one little thing,
before I forget.

1062
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:12,404
- You look great in blue.
- Thanks.

1063
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:15,845
You have to jump! We only get paid
if the customer wakes up!

1064
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:17,961
<i>Oh my God.</i>

1065
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:21,319
What's that music?
Do you hear it too?

1066
01:10:25,247 --> 01:10:28,045
It's like totally possessing me.

1067
01:10:50,127 --> 01:10:53,642
Faun!

1068
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,636
Ramira!

1069
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:58,281
Pedro!

1070
01:10:58,647 --> 01:11:00,558
You'd rather stay here with me?

1071
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:04,119
That's very sweet of you,

1072
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:05,800
but this is all a dream.
It isn't real.

1073
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:09,159
Fuck the real world!

1074
01:12:06,727 --> 01:12:07,762
Ofendia?

1075
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:12,526
Yes, Mom. It was me.
I've been leaving you clues

1076
01:12:12,687 --> 01:12:13,802
so you'd find Simeon.

1077
01:12:13,967 --> 01:12:15,286
He's here, don't you see?

1078
01:12:20,327 --> 01:12:22,557
Son!
I've finally found you!

1079
01:12:23,207 --> 01:12:25,402
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1080
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:26,682
Can't you see he's dead?

1081
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:30,686
You're so tan!

1082
01:12:31,207 --> 01:12:32,765
What's wrong?
Answer Mommy.

1083
01:12:32,967 --> 01:12:34,241
Answer Mommy.

1084
01:12:38,007 --> 01:12:39,156
No!

1085
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:57,162
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1086
01:12:57,327 --> 01:13:01,639
<i>If all this is in my head,</i>
<i>then I can control it.</i>

1087
01:13:01,887 --> 01:13:02,876
<i>Concentrate.</i>

1088
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:04,842
<i>Concentrate.</i>

1089
01:13:05,367 --> 01:13:06,402
<i>Concentrate.</i>

1090
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:08,162
<i>Concentrate.</i>

1091
01:13:52,607 --> 01:13:53,642
Pedro!

1092
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:57,243
Ramira, I can do anything I want
now. I can have any body

1093
01:13:57,407 --> 01:13:59,841
- you want!
- I like you as you are.

1094
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:01,486
Nobody's perfect.

1095
01:15:07,567 --> 01:15:09,285
LAXATIVE
EXTRA STRONG

1096
01:15:11,847 --> 01:15:12,597
No!

1097
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:14,326
What have you done?

1098
01:15:14,487 --> 01:15:15,920
I need to take a crap!

1099
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:18,237
No, listen. This is all a dream.
It's not real.

1100
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:19,999
Yes, it is, trust me.

1101
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:23,523
This is a dream and in dreams
your wishes can come true.

1102
01:15:23,927 --> 01:15:27,283
If you concentrate, if you believe,
Simeon can come back.

1103
01:15:27,527 --> 01:15:29,324
Concentrate. Concentrate.

1104
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,282
Mommy.

1105
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:45,320
No, not him.
Remember, believing is...

1106
01:15:46,327 --> 01:15:48,124
Concentrate, damn it!

1107
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:58,156
Hi, Mommy.

1108
01:16:01,327 --> 01:16:02,362
Son!

1109
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:04,322
My son!

1110
01:16:05,447 --> 01:16:06,800
It stinks.

1111
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:09,836
My love.

1112
01:16:11,407 --> 01:16:12,396
My precious.

1113
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:14,641
My son.

1114
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:17,880
Look, you have nothing to fear.

1115
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:19,841
Look.

1116
01:16:26,087 --> 01:16:27,725
I'll be right back!

1117
01:16:37,407 --> 01:16:38,681
Come with me, Simeon.

1118
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:41,407
I'll show you the world
your disease wouldn't let you see.

1119
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:42,761
Would you like that?

1120
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:46,007
I don't know.
I don't trust you one bit.

1121
01:16:58,007 --> 01:16:59,645
You needn't fear the sun anymore.

1122
01:17:18,287 --> 01:17:20,403
I'll always be here for you,
Simeon...

1123
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:24,403
Oops!

1124
01:17:32,207 --> 01:17:33,276
Oh my God.

1125
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:39,521
Get it all on fucking tape!

1126
01:17:40,647 --> 01:17:42,922
Weird things are happening
in this house.

1127
01:17:43,087 --> 01:17:45,726
Live and in color,
a horde of zombies.

1128
01:17:46,247 --> 01:17:47,726
What the hell is this?

1129
01:17:47,887 --> 01:17:49,559
What are you doing here?

1130
01:17:49,727 --> 01:17:51,046
Stupid intern!

1131
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:14,561
Not the sun!

1132
01:18:14,967 --> 01:18:15,956
No!

1133
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,637
A little champagne, sunshine?

1134
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,240
Ouch!

1135
01:18:38,207 --> 01:18:41,916
We're here, surrounded by zombies,
on live television.

1136
01:18:42,087 --> 01:18:45,204
Completely covered in human blood...

1137
01:18:45,407 --> 01:18:47,238
and naked, yes, naked.

1138
01:18:47,487 --> 01:18:48,806
Coming right up.

1139
01:18:49,447 --> 01:18:52,166
Here goes. That makes... 507.

1140
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,238
Here, your tapa.

1141
01:18:57,887 --> 01:19:00,401
Keep your eyes on the marble,
ladies.

1142
01:19:00,807 --> 01:19:01,762
Where is it?

1143
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,363
Living <i>dead....</i>

1144
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:25,041
That fucking hurt!

1145
01:19:41,647 --> 01:19:45,686
We're professionals and we'll do
anything to bring you the news!

1146
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,758
If she gets eaten, too bad.

1147
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:51,317
The audience wants to know
what's going on!

1148
01:19:51,527 --> 01:19:53,836
What it's like to be devoured alive!

1149
01:19:55,247 --> 01:19:59,365
The zombies are throwing
things at us!

1150
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:00,523
We're going to die!

1151
01:20:11,527 --> 01:20:13,006
This sucks!

1152
01:20:16,127 --> 01:20:18,083
I've done things you don't...

1153
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:19,362
I don't want to know.

1154
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:25,798
- I tried, okay?
- Cut.

1155
01:20:26,967 --> 01:20:28,400
No, no!

1156
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:32,116
It's closed.

1157
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:35,396
What's wrong with you guys?

1158
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:39,201
Since we always keep the house
so dark...

1159
01:20:39,687 --> 01:20:42,406
Sorry. Did I hit you in the nuts?

1160
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:44,199
I can't feel anything.

1161
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:46,483
You're all skin and bones!

1162
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:49,844
When I gain some weight
I'll hump your brains out.

1163
01:20:58,687 --> 01:20:59,563
It's ready.

1164
01:21:08,247 --> 01:21:11,125
PORN OUI

1165
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:13,721
Mine, mine!

1166
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:15,037
And Ramira?

1167
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:19,718
You'll have to choose between
Ramira or that great head of hair.

1168
01:21:20,247 --> 01:21:22,044
I'll take the hair.
See you later.

1169
01:21:22,807 --> 01:21:23,762
Cut!

1170
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:25,396
You were recording?

1171
01:21:28,767 --> 01:21:30,359
Who locked the door?

1172
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:42,485
What do you mean you won't jump?
We only get paid...

1173
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:44,762
Want me to say it?

1174
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:00,280
Robot. A robot.

1175
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:01,643
A robot?

1176
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:04,003
A drummer boy. A drummer boy.

1177
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:05,236
No, Jesus.

1178
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,564
Rabbit. A little rabbit.

1179
01:22:08,847 --> 01:22:11,202
Like this. Flying.

1180
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:12,999
Jesus. Goodbye.

1181
01:22:20,487 --> 01:22:23,081
Crazy? I'm not crazy.

1182
01:22:28,287 --> 01:22:30,403
Dance, dance!

1183
01:22:30,727 --> 01:22:34,117
Dance, my son.
Oh, your hair has grown!

1184
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:35,800
Sebastian!

1185
01:22:49,407 --> 01:22:50,840
Good to see you.
