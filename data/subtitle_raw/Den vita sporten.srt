00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,499
A film by:

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,580
with contributions by
Bo Jonsson and Staffan Lamm.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,472
On 3 May 1968, a Davis Cup tennis
match was set to be played in Båstad

4
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:26,315
between Sweden and Rhodesia.
This match never took place.

5
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,674
The following film covers the
circumstances surrounding this...

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,103
Why did you want to stop
the match in Båstad?

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
I think that politics and sports
really belong together,

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
that sport has a real
political function,

9
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:54,510
that politics permeates
all aspects of society

10
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,843
and thus also permeates sports.

11
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,961
I feel there is a tendency
in our society to consider

12
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:06,686
politics the preserve of professional
politicians, government, party officials.

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,880
And that the man on the street

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,402
is somehow incapable
or unqualified to take

15
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,880
a position on political issues.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,777
But with channels of information
available in Sweden today

17
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:21,790
through mass media,
we can actually inform ourselves

18
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,580
well enough to be able to adopt
a political position.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,183
This tendency causes many people,

20
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:30,734
under the pretext of so-called
objectivity, to become passive,

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to become apolitical.

22
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:37,830
And I think that’s absurd,
because that means

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,450
they renounce a democratic
opportunity to change society.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,720
I want to change society,

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,070
that’s why I feel it’s so important
to protest against this match.

26
00:01:58,445 --> 00:02:02,649
Our neutrality policy does not
condemn us to silence.

27
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,738
Silence can be the ally of injustice.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,909
Silence can be seen
as supporting reaction.

29
00:02:11,227 --> 00:02:18,270
We must have the right to assert
the ideals of universal freedom

30
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,510
and fellowship
of solidarity and justice.

31
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,702
Let our opponents on the right beware:

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,490
don’t try to use neutrality as a cover

33
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:38,999
to muzzle the Swedish
labour movement.

34
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,000
You will never succeed.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
OLAF PALME
Minister of Education

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,118
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
What do I think?
They should cancel the match.

37
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:52,782
But whether the sports association
decides to do that is another question.

38
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:56,880
But what are you going to do about it?
- Well, what can one do about it?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,287
I mean, why should I
do something about it?

40
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:04,966
That’s my attitude regarding
the sports association.

41
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,679
If they were to ask me,
I’d tell them what I think.

42
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:13,000
Then it’s up to them
what they do about it.

43
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:15,911
ENGINE DRIVER
No, I don't like it.

44
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:19,703
Are you going to do anything about it?
- No, I’m not.

45
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,556
That’s up to the ones who…
I mean… I have no...

46
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:30,290
I’m not going to personally
do anything about all this.

47
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,622
But I am of the opinion that
the match shouldn’t be played.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,880
Why?

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,880
Because I feel that the racial policy
in Rhodesia isn't what it ought to be.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,563
CEMENT WORKER AND HIS WIFE
It should be stopped, of course.

51
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:44,661
How?

52
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:48,404
How? Just see to it that they stop,
don’t let them play.

53
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,633
Who is supposed to see
that they don't play?

54
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:55,351
Well, I suppose it’s up to the Sports…
what’s it called now…

55
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:01,235
the Sports Association to see to that.

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,880
Who’s supposed to see to it that
the Sports Association does that?

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,630
Yeah, well, that’s just it, isn’t it?

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,880
Can you do anything?
- No, we can't do anything, no.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,250
Why not?

60
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,250
We aren't powerful enough.

61
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:29,340
Well, there are some talented
tennis players who, it seems,

62
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:33,330
are as bad at politics
as I am at tennis.

63
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:37,266
And what does that mean, Minister?

64
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:40,501
Well, that's my position
regarding this match.

65
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,321
And those attempts that will be
made to stop this match,

66
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:45,179
how should they be viewed?

67
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:49,181
I don't want to comment on that
because I know too little about it.

68
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:51,999
Above all it is the responsibility

69
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,880
of the Tennis Association to say

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,780
what they think is
the decent thing to do.

71
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,780
Is it not possible for someone higher up to?

72
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,880
We live in a free country,
so we don’t interfere in sports

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,430
in such a way as to recommend
that they do one thing or the other,

74
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:13,466
With the Olympics, it’s a question
of money, but that’s not the case here.

75
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:14,999
DISTRICT CHAIRMAN
SWEDISH DEMOCRATIC
YOUTH LEAGUE (SSU)

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,058
Peter Wallenberg’s dealings in
Rhodesia are a separate chapter.

77
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:22,380
It’s his company, his company is
investing in Rhodesia

78
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,399
Atlas Copco, we know for certain,

79
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,000
and he is also the one keeping the
Tennis Association afloat.

80
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:31,767
He’s more or less financing it,

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,637
and he’s also a partner
in the tennis stadium here.

82
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:41,999
That means that our protest
against the Smith regime

83
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:47,377
must also be directed
at those industrialists in Sweden

84
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:50,380
and the rest of the world
who, through their economic ties

85
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
with Smith, support this racist,
fascist regime.

86
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,999
HERMAN KLING, MINISTER OF JUSTICE

87
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:59,419
It is not for me,
as Minister of Justice,

88
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,500
to comment on the policy
of Swedish sports associations.

89
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:09,000
The Swedish government’s policy
is another matter entirely,

90
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,000
and there is no doubt as to its position
with regard to Rhodesia.

91
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,499
TEAM CAPTAIN, SWEDISH
TENNIS ASSOCIATION

92
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,110
I feel a little resentful
at the prospect

93
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,886
of there being demonstrations
that violate the law.

94
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:25,457
As long as the demonstrations
adhere to the law, then I accept them.

95
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:28,326
I think it’s quite acceptable,

96
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:31,329
but if they violate the law,
then that has to be wrong.

97
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:34,030
Are you afraid of that happening?
- No, I am not.

98
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,375
There’s been a fair bit in the press
about activist groups.

99
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:40,000
You’re not afraid that such
elements are going to...?

100
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,802
I’m not afraid,
but I think it would be a shame

101
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:46,942
if they were allowed to break the law.

102
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:48,500
I see.

103
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,380
You are aware that a broad swath
of public opinion in Sweden

104
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,380
feels that the Tennis Association
has subjected the country,

105
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,648
has put Sweden in an untenable position...

106
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,880
I wouldn’t call it a broad swath.

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,287
You don’t think it’s broad?
- Well, I mean, we don’t know that.

108
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,500
Do we?

109
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Do we? I mean, you tell me...

110
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,499
RUNE JOHANSSON
Foreign Minister

111
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,499
They clearly have another point

112
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,499
of departure for their assessment,

113
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
namely that of sports as an activity that

114
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
bridges differences between countries.

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,999
But in this case,

116
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,499
I feel that they ought to have shown

117
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,999
more respect for the official position

118
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,999
toward the country
that the players come from

119
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,999
and the public opinion that exists here

120
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,999
that sympathizes with the plight

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,500
of colored groups

122
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,999
and the difficulties they face.

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Those feelings are very strong here.

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,999
Do you feel that the Swedish government

125
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,750
has done what it could to prevent it?

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Officially, there’s nothing more
we could have done.…

127
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So you feel that you’ve made your
views clear on this issue?

128
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,499
Yes, the sports organizations cannot
be unaware of them.

129
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
They’re not unaware of them?

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,500
No. But I don’t think there’s been any

131
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,999
official intervention to influence matters.

132
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They’re independent organizations.

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,799
POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENT

134
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,499
You’re part of the group heading
to Båstad tomorrow?

135
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
M-hm.

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why are you going?

137
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,999
We feel that it’s necessary to protest

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,999
against white oppression in Rhodesia,
and to really be serious about it.

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,999
I don’t mean just walking around with a sign

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,999
or expressing our views,

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,499
but really trying to stop the match

142
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,999
precisely the difference between
a protest movement

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,899
and the resistance movement that

144
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,799
Stokley Carmichel and others spoke about.

145
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,999
When you're in a resistance movement,

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,999
you mean what you say,
and you resist actively.

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That’s what we should try
to do with this match.

148
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,999
How far do you think you should go

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,500
in order to put a stop to the match?

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,499
First of all, these methods

151
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,499
aren't something we're just talking about.

152
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,999
We really intend to stop the match.

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,499
Then whatever disturbances

154
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,499
end up taking place, is up to the police.

155
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,000
The most important thing
is just to be able to stop the match.

156
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,999
What’s your take on it?

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,499
I’m going down there because

158
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,499
I feel that this is a way to expose

159
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,999
the political stance
that the Tennis Association

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,499
is in fact adopting
by organizing this match

161
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,999
with representatives of this

162
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,500
oppressive regime in Rhodesia.

163
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,999
Furthermore,
I feel it is important

164
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,499
to make it clear to
the Swedish people

165
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,499
that the political reality
permeates everything,

166
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,000
that it’s integrated into
everything we say and do.

167
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,999
It’s that great myth that society
is divided into sectors,

168
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,999
that there’s just a little part of society

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,999
that has anything to do with politics –

170
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
with elections every four years
or something like that.

171
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,499
What I mean is that

172
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
politics permeates everything.

173
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,000
Everything has a political relevance.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And in that sense, this match
is most definitely a political issue.

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,999
These are representatives of a white,

176
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
completely illegal, oppressive,
fascist regime

177
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,000
that are coming here
and we can’t tolerate that.

178
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
PRESSURE MOUNTING

YOUTH ASSOCIATIONS DEFY BAN
ON DEMONSTRATIONS IN BÅSTAD

180
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
BÅSTAD MATCH:
POLICE PREPARED FOR WAR

181
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,499
MUNICIPAL WORKER

182
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,600
We don’t have much to do with it,
those of us who just work.

183
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,100
That’s more for the rich,

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,500
who can sort of do
more as they please.

185
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,499
We don’t have much chance
of making it into those circles,

186
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
where they play tennis.

187
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,999
So you think it’s a rich man’s sport?

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, it is.

189
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,749
Do you feel that
the Tennis Association

190
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,000
was wrong to bring
the match here to Båstad?

191
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,750
Well they’ve gone against the others…

192
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,000
against ordinary people...

193
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,000
that’s why there’s going
to be demonstrations.

194
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,499
My lady, gentlemen,
I bid you all a warm welcome

195
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,000
to the Båstad Tennis Stadium
and the drawing for the first round

196
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
of the Davis Cup match between
Sweden and Rhodesia.

197
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The matches are scheduled for Friday, 2.00 pm,

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
Saturday, 2.00 pm and Sunday 1.00 p.m..

199
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,500
I am now going to hand
the floor over to Sven Davidson,

200
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,500
who is going to act as referee
and who will be in charge of the drawing.

201
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,000
After which,
we, along with the two teams,

202
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
will be at your disposal to answer
any questions you might have.

203
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,500
Go ahead, Sven!

204
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,000
The two captains have
submitted their teams.

205
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,999
Adrian Bay,
captain of the Rhodesian team,

206
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,999
has nominated Frank Salamon

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
and himself for the single matches.

208
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,499
The captain of the Swedish team,

209
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Birger Folke, has nominated

210
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,499
Ove Bengtsson as number one

211
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
and Hans Nerell as number two.

212
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,500
I have here four slips of paper.

213
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,000
I think we should let Åke Eriksson
draw this time.

214
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,500
This will be his 35th consecutive year at Båstad.

215
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
He first came here in 1934.

216
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,499
We now have the two slips of paper

217
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,499
with the Swedish players’ names in here,

218
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
and the Rhodesian players’ names in here.

219
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,999
Could I ask Åke Eriksson

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to draw one slip from each of them.

221
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,499
The two names that Åke draws are going

222
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,499
to face each other in the first single’s match.

223
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
Please go ahead.

224
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,000
Adrian Bay, for Rhodesia.

225
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Ove Bengtsson, for Sweden.

226
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,500
Would you please verify.

227
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,000
Go by bus from…
how long do you think it’ll take?

228
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,500
Ten…
It’s about 500km from here…

229
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
That depends; ten, twelve hours maybe.

230
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,500
Ten hours?

231
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,000
From Stockholm to Båstad?

232
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,000
No, each person will have
to bring their own food.

233
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,500
That can’t be organized.

234
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,749
Maybe we can come up with
some collective solution

235
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,000
for everyone down there,
that I don’t know…

236
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,500
Thirty? That depends…
forty crowns at the most.

237
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No more than forty,
no less than thirty-five.

238
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
The reason we’re going to Båstad is

239
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
because we feel that this tennis match

240
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,000
between Rhodesia and Sweden

241
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,999
serves as a form of recognition

242
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,500
for the government in Rhodesia,

243
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,499
which we are trying to boycott and topple

244
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,000
through the UN and by other means.

245
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,999
And we feel that the decision that

246
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,250
was taken to hold this match

247
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,000
was taken above the heads
of the people, of public opinion.

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,999
The Swedish Tennis Association’s
Board of Directors comprises

249
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,999
representatives from
Wallenberg companies,

250
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
from Enskilda Banken, and companies

251
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,999
such as Atlas Copco and Alfa Laval

252
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
who are doing business with Rhodesia,

253
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,000
even though the UN passed a formal
resolution boycotting Rhodesia.

254
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,999
That is why we feel this decision to hold

255
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
this match in Sweden to be undemocratic.

256
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,499
How many are coming from Stockholm

257
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
and how are they going to get down there?

258
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,000
There will be about a hundred of us,

259
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
and we’ll be driving down
in busses and in private cars.

260
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,499
We’re setting off from here on
Thursday evening

261
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
and will arrive
in Båstad Friday morning

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,999
and will meet up
with our comrades-in-arms

263
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,500
from other areas of the country,

264
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
particularly Lund, Gothenburg and
Uppsala.

265
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,500
You’re going to Båstad tomorrow
to try and stop the tennis match?

266
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, that’s right.

267
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,999
Has this initiative been taken
in consultation

268
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
with any organization here in Lund?

269
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Or is it also in part a
private initiative?

270
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There are several organizations
here in Lund that are planning to go.

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,750
And also people outside
those organizations,

272
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,499
but above all
it’s the South Africa Committee

273
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,000
and the Vietnam Committee
here in Lund,

274
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,999
and then the Ecumenical
Development Group,

275
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to which I belong, is also going.

276
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Many of us anyway.

277
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,499
According to reports,
the police are preparing

278
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,000
to do all they can
to stop the demonstration.

279
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,250
How far are you yourself
prepared to go in order

280
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,200
to push through your
and the others’ decision?

281
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,999
Well, as far as possible,
that is until we’ve got what we…

282
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,999
until our demands have been met, that is.

283
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That might involve breaking the law.

284
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,000
Are you prepared to break the law?

285
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
You’re going to Båstad tomorrow?

286
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,250
Yes.

287
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,000
What do you want to do there?

288
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Demonstrate against the
match that’s going to be played.

289
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,250
The decision was made
yesterday to ban demonstrations.

290
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,199
Yes, before six o’clock,

291
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
but I consider that to be a provocation
on the part of the police,

292
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,999
since they knew very well

293
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that there were going to be
many demonstrators.

294
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,599
Are you going to demonstrate any way,

295
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,250
even if it means breaking the law?

296
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

297
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Why is it important?

298
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In order to mobilize public opinion

299
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,200
against the regime in Rhodesia.

300
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
You’re going to Båstad tomorrow to stop

301
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,000
the match against Rhodesia?

302
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,250
Why?

303
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Because... I consider it to be my
duty as a Christian

304
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,500
to stand on the side of the oppressed,

305
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,999
and against the oppressors.

306
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,200
What do you want to
achieve by this action?

307
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
To stop the match for one thing,

308
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,000
but also to disseminate information

309
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,500
about the situation in Rhodesia,

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,999
and to demonstrate
that there is public opinion

311
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,250
that is opposed to
the regime in Rhodesia.

312
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
How many are going to
be there, approximately?

313
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
From Lund,
approximately two hundred.

314
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,200
Do you think you'll succeed
in stopping it?

315
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,500
Yes, I do.

316
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,199
It’s strange that a little
community like Båstad

317
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
can find itself at the centre
of world events like this,

318
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,600
all because we've got a few
tennis players coming here.

319
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,000
I can’t believe that it serves

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
any reasonable purpose

321
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
to pour it on like this;

322
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,250
it’s always the innocent people

323
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,500
who get caught in the middle

324
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,499
and these players that

325
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,000
Rhodesia is sending here,

326
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,500
they haven’t had any influence

327
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,000
on the regime in their country,

328
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,750
and aren’t in a position to bring about

329
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
a change in that regime.

330
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
It's often said that you shouldn't

331
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,000
mix sports with politics;

332
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,999
and I’d say that’s something

333
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,999
worth bearing in mind.

334
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,499
You agree with that?

335
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,250
Yes; it's not appropriate.

336
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
TEAM CAPTAIN
RHODESIA

337
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,999
DENTAL STUDENT
This Davis Cup match

338
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
is a competition between
the countries of Sweden and Rhodesia;

339
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,400
the Rhodesian players are not playing

340
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,100
as private individuals,

341
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,000
but as representatives
of the Rhodesian nation.

342
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,200
All of them are white.

343
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The whites in Rhodesia make up

344
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
10% of the country's population.

345
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,500
The white minority is engaged

346
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,999
in the systematic oppression

347
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,999
and exploitation

348
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,500
of the black population.

349
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If we allow these white players

350
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
to represent Rhodesia

351
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,250
in a national competition,

352
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
then I can’t see it as anything
other

353
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,000
than a recognition
of the Smith regime,

354
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,900
and I don’t want that.

355
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,199
Båstad, which is usually rather empty
and quiet around this time,

356
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,199
is currently in the midst
of intense preparations

357
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,499
that, according to
local residents,

358
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,499
far exceeds those leading up

359
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,000
to the big invasion every summer
and the tennis tournaments.

360
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,000
Close to a hundred journalists

361
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,500
and photographers
from local papers

362
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,499
and international
news agencies

363
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,000
have gathered here,

364
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,999
and the three permanently
stationed police officers

365
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
at the little stationhouse

366
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
have been reinforced
by several hundred colleagues

367
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,000
from the whole of southern Sweden.

368
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,199
But so far there has been no sign

369
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,199
of the reportedly thousands

370
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,199
of demonstrating youths

371
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
for whom everyone is waiting

372
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
for in anxious anticipation.

373
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,999
Kristianstad’s County Police
Commissioner, Hans Fjellner,

374
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
thinks that it’s going to be

375
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,000
a calm tennis tournament, after all.

376
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
<i>(Vietnamese national anthem, in Swedish)

377
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,500
It’s the race problems
that are responsible for all of this.

378
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
The race policies in Rhodesia?

379
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes, that's right.

380
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,999
Do you think that they’re  right
to demonstrate

381
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,100
against it here in Sweden?
How do you feel about it?

382
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes, I support that point of view…

383
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,000
that they should demonstrate.

384
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,700
That they should be allowed
to demonstrate?

385
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,500
So you hope that
they are met with restraint?

386
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,749
Of course I also hope

387
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,000
that the demonstrators show restraint.

388
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That they conduct themselves
in a dignified manner?

389
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,499
Do you think
that the tennis association

390
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,000
should have handled
this differently

391
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,000
and moved the match,
or simply not played against Rhodesia?

392
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,900
I don’t think they should have played.

393
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You don’t think so?

394
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,499
It’s the same as if you were to

395
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,499
be given an assignment

396
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,000
to carry out by your employer;
you’d have to do it.

397
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,500
We don’t want the match

398
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,500
hindered in any way;

399
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,750
we just want everything

400
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,700
to progress in good order.

401
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,000
So you think it’s in order

402
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,000
that they go ahead with the match?

403
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,100
This isn’t about what we think,

404
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
but the duty that our employer
has charged us with.

405
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,000
Would you be relieved if

406
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
the Swedish Tennis Association
cancelled the match?

407
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,999
My own personal take on this –

408
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,199
not as a police officer,

409
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,000
but completely my
own personal view –

410
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
is that riots must be avoided.

411
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,999
Then, those measures

412
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,500
ought to have been taken.

413
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,249
That is my own personal view.

414
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,249
As a police officer I am obliged

415
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:21,999
to follow the laws and regulations,

416
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,999
and the command
structure that we have.

417
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,749
But your personal point of view is -

418
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,500
Completely personal.

419
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,500
That...

420
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
That it ought to be cancelled.

421
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They should cancel the match?
- Yes.

422
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,999
In order to avoid the risk of riots?

423
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,600
Yes.

424
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,499
Thank you.

425
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,000
I don’t like blood.

426
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,249
You cannot separate

427
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,000
economics from politics, period,

428
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,000
or view any sector of society as apolitical.

429
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,000
You can look at examples
from history,

430
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,000
such as the Nazi regime in Germany,

431
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,999
they had a very high-profile Olympics,

432
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,999
which of course became a great

433
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
propaganda coup for that regime.

434
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,500
In that case there were
no great protests,

435
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,000
but one can imagine that

436
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,000
if some effective action

437
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,999
had been taken against the Olympic bid,

438
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,999
that more people would
have been roused in time

439
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,499
and seen the danger of what
was going on in Germany,

440
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
and I think it’s just as
important that we now

441
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
focus public opinion on
what is going on in Africa,

442
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,499
how the same kind of
fascist regime

443
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,250
is being strengthened there.

444
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,999
1500 PREPARED FOR ROUGH
RECEPTION IN BÅSTAD

445
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,999
COUNTY POLICE COMMISSIONER:

446
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,999
POLICE DEPT EXPECTS DEMO TO
BE CONDUCTED IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER

447
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,999
THUS, WE DO NOT HAVE
PLANS FOR FORCEFUL ACTION

448
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,999
ANY TALK OF WATER CANNONS
IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS

449
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,999
MASS PROTEST

450
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
TO BÅSTAD PARTICIPANTS:
DO NOT ESCALATE

451
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
NERVES ON EDGE
AHEAD OF MATCH

452
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,999
You mentioned a pair of scissors.

453
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,099
Yes, that's what we need.

454
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,500
For what?

455
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,200
To give these long-haired individuals
a haircut.

456
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,200
You'd cut off their hair?

457
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,999
Yes, they need it!

458
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,999
What do you think about
what they’re doing?

459
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,999
Well, it's all very childish...

460
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,500
It's childish?

461
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,100
Yes, it is.

462
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,600
You think that they’re ruining Båstad?

463
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,149
I think they should stay at home.

464
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,200
What business to they
have coming down here?

465
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,899
They’re demonstrating
against this tennis match.

466
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,100
Well, it won’t get them anywhere.

467
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,250
It won't do any good?

468
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,500
No. Four unfortunate players come here
and they have to suffer for it.

469
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
How do we play against other nations?

470
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,999
Spain was here playing
football yesterday, right?

471
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,499
It’s the same situation there as in…

472
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,499
What do you think
would have been

473
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,999
the wisest thing to do right now?

474
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,999
Well, nothing. Just let them play.

475
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Is that what you think?

476
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,999
You don’t think it would have

477
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
been wise to cancel the match?

478
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,999
No, since the whole thing was
decided by lot,

479
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,500
it doesn’t matter who…

480
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Then it has to run its course.

481
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Absolutely! That’s only fair.

482
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,500
Sweden shouldn't have to suffer for it.

483
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,999
JOURNALIST, KVÄLLSPOSTEN

484
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It’s interesting
that people are coming here,

485
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,999
and it’s sure
to be a very interesting day,

486
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that afterwards there will be
every reason

487
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
to shed light on in peace and quiet,

488
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
in an objective debate.

489
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,000
Yes, that's quite right.

490
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,100
I have nothing against
the demonstrations as such.

491
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,999
I'm just afraid it doesn't

492
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,500
do much to help the black man.

493
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,999
But rather, when all this is over,

494
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,999
everyone will go home,

495
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and the black man will be
just as badly off.

496
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,500
So, for my part, I’ve suggested
that each demonstrator

497
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,499
should carry a collection box

498
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:20,999
into which they put ten crowns
and see to it

499
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,999
that another forty crowns
make it in there.

500
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,499
then we could easily collect, together,

501
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
the sum of a hundred thousand crowns.

502
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,500
And that we could use
to bring over

503
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,499
colored children,

504
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,000
orphaned colored children.

505
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,000
That’s what demonstrators
are doing in the case of Vietnam.

506
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,999
It’s a good idea,
and it would have been great

507
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
if they had done that here, too.

508
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
But at the same time,
I’ve suggested

509
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,499
that the Tennis Association,
as an incentive

510
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,499
for the demonstrators
to take part in it,

511
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,999
make an initial contribution
of 20 to 30,000 crowns to such a fund.

512
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,999
But it was dismissed,

513
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,499
both by the representatives

514
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,999
of the Tennis Association

515
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,500
and from the other side.

516
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But I have nothing
against their demonstrating,

517
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,750
so long as it takes place
in a dignified manner.

518
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,050
If they start fighting,
that I don’t like.

519
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,999
The right to demonstrate

520
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,499
is something we
should safeguard,

521
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,999
especially when it’s been so well

522
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
looked after over the years,

523
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,000
especially earlier on

524
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,000
by the Social Democrats.

525
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,999
If you consider
that the Tennis Assocation,

526
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,500
which followed the National
Sports Confederation’s directives

527
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,999
that we are allowed
to compete against any

528
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,999
internationally approved
sports association –

529
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,999
a directive that was reviewed

530
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
by the government
just six years ago.

531
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,000
If they had granted a walkover

532
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,000
and Rhodesia
had gone to Spain instead,

533
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,999
then we wouldn't have been given
the chance to speak our minds

534
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,499
to say we don't like apartheid.

535
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,499
By holding the match,

536
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,499
we have been given the opportunity

537
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
to say what we think about apartheid.

538
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,500
Just so long as we do it
in an objective manner.

539
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,000
Can you stop this
match with non-violence?

540
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,500
As far as possible..

541
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Is that really realistic?

542
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,000
We’ll have to see.

543
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,100
It’s very important to the outward

544
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,999
objectives of this action,

545
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
that it be conducted
in a dignified manner.

546
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
We are very, very aware of that,

547
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,999
and have also worked according
to those principles.

548
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,999
But not to the extent

549
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,900
that we’ll compromise on our goal.

550
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Of stopping the match.

551
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,200
Do you think the match will be stopped?

552
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,999
I have a hard time seeing how it

553
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
can be done, but it’s possible.

554
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It all depends on what tactics they use.

555
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,250
I am absolutely convinced
that we will succeed.

556
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,249
Are you sure
that you can sort of control

557
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,000
any elements that might
get a bit violent?

558
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,999
As regards those people

559
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,999
we’ve been in touch with, we’re sure of it.

560
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And we also have some tools to
help us in that respect,

561
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Such as our slogan:

562
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,999
We remain calm when the police attack-

563
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,499
in order to strengthen our unity,

564
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
to ensure that any provocations fail.

565
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Whether on the part of the police,

566
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
or those who identify themselves

567
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,000
with the Rhodesian regime

568
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
or the actions of the Tennis Association.

569
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,499
Of course, but then in this context

570
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,000
they ought to have blocked

571
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,000
Rhodesia's application
to the Davis Cup.

572
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,000
Isn't it a little crazy when Rhodesia's

573
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
application has been accepted...

574
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,000
Surely "the show must go on",
as they say.

575
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
No, I don’t think "the show must go on".

576
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
most definitely
"the show must be stopped."

577
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,500
We are not the ones
who accepted Rhodesia’s application.

578
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,999
No, it was the International
Tennis Association.

579
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,500
Yes, that's right.

580
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,500
And then we have to play by our rules.

581
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,500
What are your rules?

582
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,499
Well, we’re going to hold
a demonstration here

583
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
in calm and dignified order.

584
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,999
We're going to walk three

585
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
abreast down to the courts.

586
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We’re going to stand
outside by the main entrance.

587
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,499
Then we’ll stand there until two o’clock

588
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,999
when the match begins.

589
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,999
If it does end up getting started.

590
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,249
Then there will be people who have

591
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,999
made it inside by buying tickets,

592
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,749
made it onto the court,
but they’ll have to…

593
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,000
what they get up to
is their own business, right?

594
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,000
The students from Lund and others
who are going to march with us,

595
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,999
they'll have to play by our rules.

596
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Who’s "us" then?

597
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,500
The Youth League of
the People's Party

598
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and the Swedish Social
Democratic Youth League..

599
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,999
I’ll call up the leaders for Stockholm,
Gothenburg, Uppsala and so on.

600
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Everyone except Lund – Malmö.

601
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,999
Lund - Malmö will go to one entrance,

602
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,499
Stockholm and the others

603
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,499
will go to the other entrance.

604
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,999
And it’s important that we
keep these groups together,

605
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
that we follow these leaders,

606
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,999
and don’t take any personal initiatives.

607
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,500
Just do whatever they initiate.

608
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,999
Is that understood?

609
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,500
Yes.

610
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:52,999
So are you going to join our procession?

611
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,499
Yes.

612
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,000
WHITES PLAY BALL
BLACKS DON'T MATTER

613
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,299
Three abreast.

614
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,250
You can’t be more than three abreast,

615
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,950
Those of you in charge,

616
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,250
make sure that there
are only three abreast.

617
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,250
You'll be marching three by three!

618
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,999
FREEDOM FOR ZIMBABWE

619
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
LET THE STANDS BE EMPTY

620
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
TENNIS STINKS

621
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,900
Our ability to express
ourselves has been sharply curtailed.

622
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
There are very few channels through
which we can express our views.

623
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We rarely get to be heard in
the mass media, in TV and radio,

624
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,000
and on those few occasions
when we do,

625
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,499
the radio management makes
a conscious attempt

626
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,000
to neutralize what we say
by commenting on what we've said after

627
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
assuming the role of interpreter
for what we really mean,

628
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
as if we were incapable
of communicating that ourselves.

629
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,000
Then regarding newspapers:

630
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,000
Our time is marked by the
shutting down of newspapers,

631
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,000
which of course leads to a
monopolizing of the print industry.

632
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,999
We’re having a very hard time

633
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
getting articles onto the main pages

634
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,999
of the newspapers,
in the cultural pages.

635
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,999
Celebrity personalities like
Jan Myrdal and Sara Lidman

636
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,999
are really the only ones who

637
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,500
make it onto the cultural pages.

638
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,999
At best we might be able

639
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,500
to get is articles in the
letter-to-the-editors column.

640
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,499
And those articles that we

641
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,499
on occasion manage to get in there

642
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,499
are drastically edited,

643
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,500
certain sentences removed,

644
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,500
thus changing the entire meaning,

645
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,999
so that everything we say is skewed,

646
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
and thereby used against us.

647
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,500
There is no right to demonstrate

648
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,500
written into the Swedish constitution,

649
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,000
nor is there any right of assembly.

650
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,000
That right is written into the
constitutions of many other countries.

651
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Instead, in Sweden we apply a praxis

652
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
where it is up to the police to decide

653
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
on demonstrations.

654
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,499
A police force is not

655
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,000
a democratically elected authority.

656
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,500
Its makeup does not in any way

657
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
reflect the political composition

658
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,000
of Swedish public opinion,

659
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,999
and therefore it is completely

660
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,499
wrong for the police to decide when,

661
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,000
where, and how we should be

662
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,000
allowed to demonstrate.

663
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
This forces us to use other channels,

664
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and this forces us
out into the streets.

665
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,999
We print flyers that
we hand out,

666
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,500
we print our own newspapers

667
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
that we sell and try
to distribute in various ways,

668
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and we demonstrate.

669
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,000
Sold out! Sold out! Sorry!

670
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
There is no match! It’s closed there now.

671
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,000
Next time. Salisbury, Rhodesia,
next year.

672
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,250
What business do
you have coming here?!

673
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,000
They’re boycotted by the UN...

674
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,000
it was a proper drawing!

675
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,450
But it wasn't...

676
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You dirty bastards..

677
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,500
What do you mean by that?

678
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,000
Are we the ones you're calling intellectuals?

679
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,500
Well, isn’t that what you are?

680
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:01,999
We never said that.

681
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Are you Swedish?

682
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,999
Yes.

683
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,249
Then why don’t you try to solve

684
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,250
the Swedish race problems first

685
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,000
and give the Gypsies a chance?

686
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:13,000
Try to solve that
before starting trying to solve..

687
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,999
We came to see a tennis match,

688
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and you go and stop it.

689
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,500
Did you buy tickets, too?

690
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That's exactly what I did.

691
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,499
I've been coming here to watch
the Davis Cup for years,

692
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,499
and that’s just what I want
to do now, too.

693
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,499
Then a bunch of bloody
shitheads come along

694
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,000
and stops the whole thing.

695
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Do you think that the
death sentences in Rhodesia..

696
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
What’s right and wrong, huh?

697
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,499
What the hell do you think is
going to happen

698
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,999
if they get into power down there?

699
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
There won't be any more
death sentences.

700
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Oh no? Kiss my ass.

701
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,000
Who do you mean by
"they", anyway?

702
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,500
We should just keep our traps shut
here in Sweden.

703
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,500
Let me try and explain Swedish
neutrality to you.

704
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,000
Like hell you're explaining anything!

705
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,750
Here I’ve been working
and paying taxes

706
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,999
since the age of twelve,
then you bastards run up in here -

707
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,500
the ones we've been paying for, huh?

708
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,500
Given half the chance
I'd love to punch you out, the lot of you...

709
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,999
The Tennis Association

710
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,999
has asked me to inform everyone

711
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,999
that there will be
no tennis match in Båstad…

712
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,499
Louder!

713
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:21,999
Shut up so we can hear!!

714
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,500
As we just announced,

715
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:27,500
or as County Police
Commissioner Fjellner announced…

716
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,999
Louder! Louder!

717
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,500
This is a genuine decision
on our part –

718
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,999
we are not going to play

719
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,999
the match here in Båstad.

720
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,600
I hope that you trust us on this.

721
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,499
So there is no reason
for you to stay.

722
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,499
We are not going to sneak off

723
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,499
and play here tomorrow morning

724
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,500
or anything like that.

725
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I ask that you take me at my word.

726
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
We've won here today and
now we can leave.

727
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,999
We’ll proceed up to the church hall,

728
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
where we started this morning.

729
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,999
What do you think was the most

730
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,500
important thing about what
happened here?

731
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,499
Well, I think the most important thing

732
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,499
was that we succeeded
in stopping the match,

733
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,499
that the match was really stopped,
that we succeeded in doing that.

734
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,999
That it wasn't just a public protest,

735
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,999
I mean we actually achieved

736
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
concrete results, here.
I think that was most important.

737
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
What do you think
you've gained through your action?

738
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,250
We stopped the match here

739
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,249
and we got the word out,

740
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,500
it's going to be on TV, on the radio,
in newspapers...

741
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,499
We've managed to tell a lot of people

742
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,999
that the policies being pursued
in South Rhodesia are wrong.

743
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It's a way of disseminating information.

744
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Many feel that you
shouldn't mix sports and politics.

745
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:43,500
You obviously don't feel that way.

746
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,500
Would you care to
explain that a little bit?

747
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
There is no aspect of human intercourse

748
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,499
that is without political consequences,

749
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,250
political overtones.

750
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Even in sports, politics is involved.

751
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
That’s how it is in South Africa,
in Rhodesia,

752
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,999
that even within sports,

753
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,500
this segregation exists,

754
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
so sports and politics
are in no way separate.

755
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,899
What was your experience?

756
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,999
Do you feel your action
was a success?

757
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,600
Yes, I think it was a success,

758
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,700
but it was rather disorganized.

759
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,800
The fact that it went as well as it did,

760
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,000
for our section, Stockholm-Gothenburg,

761
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,000
probably comes down to the fact

762
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:31,900
the police were even less prepared
and more disorganized than we were.

763
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,999
Do you have any comments

764
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
about the actions of the police?

765
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah, typical Swedish political police.

766
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,200
How so?

767
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,400
They always block things

768
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,999
almost always,
when it's leftist groups,

769
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,999
or when it's against racism,

770
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,500
they'll use the most brutal methods,

771
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
pulling people by the hair
and kicking them, hitting them.

772
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,900
I think they’re showing definite tendencies

773
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
towards what the Germans
did in Berlin last Easter.

774
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,999
Would you like to comment

775
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
on what took place here today?

776
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,999
No, I wouldn't.

777
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
You’ll have to ask our superiors,
they’re the ones who should comment.

778
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
We are not prepared to comment.

779
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:02,999
Not even a personal point of view

780
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,500
on how the demonstration
was conducted?

781
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,500
As a police officer I’m not
allowed to offer personal comments.

782
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,499
You weren't part of the group

783
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,999
that made it through the gates, then?

784
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,500
No, no...

785
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,000
That was only down at the lower gates.

786
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,499
But what the news wire service

787
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,500
is saying is that we were armed,
with cobblestones and iron bars..

788
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
The thing is,
if we had wanted to stop you,

789
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,000
we would have stationed four horses
and four dogs at each entrance.

790
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,000
Then nobody would have...

791
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,000
The police weren't much better
than dogs.

792
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That's a pretty positive assessment, then.

793
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,999
When a police officer

794
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,999
punches a girl with his fist,

795
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
that means something is wrong.

796
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,000
That's enough exposition on this;

797
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Let's just call it a day.

798
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,000
Yes, but there's likely to be repercussions.

799
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:57,900
Let's hope so.

800
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,200
I mean, it's illegal.

801
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
If we wanted four horses
and four dogs at each entrance,

802
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
No power on earth
could have gotten near us.

803
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I mean, we have the means.
If we want to.

804
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,000
So you didn't want to?

805
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,750
That's enough,
let's not discuss it any further.

806
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,550
You can become a war criminal

807
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
by alway following the rules...

808
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,000
THE BATTLE FOR BÅSTAD

809
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
HYDROCHLORIC ACID IMAGES

810
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,000
EXPRESSEN HAS THE PHOTOS
THAT <i>WEREN’T</i> ON TV

811
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,999
RIOTS PUT A STOP TO BÅSTAD GAMES
THE MOB ”WON” IN BÅSTAD

812
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
EGGS, OIL ON THE COURT IN BÅSTAD

813
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
INFERNO
FORMALIN

814
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,999
'THE WORST SINCE 1909'

815
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It was mob-like behavior,

816
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
something you would not expect

817
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:50,500
to see here in Sweden.

818
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,499
And the ones in the action groups

819
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,499
that howled and rampaged and

820
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
defied the police and others,

821
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,999
they least of all achieved the effect

822
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
they may think they did.

823
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,999
Of course they think they’ve

824
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,999
they’re smug and cocky and brave.

825
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,500
But the only thing the police were doing,

826
01:13:17,505 --> 01:13:20,000
was protecting them.

827
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,999
The rest of us who were standing

828
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,999
not so far away from this mob,

829
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
were hardly free to walk around,

830
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,000
we didn’t know what would happen to us.

831
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Well, I mean, it’s a shame isn’t it

832
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:32,900
Excuse me?

833
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
...It's a shame.

834
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,000
You think so?

835
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,499
I mean, all this violence and fighting –

836
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,000
it’s a shame, isn’t it.

837
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,999
Yes, of course it is,

838
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,500
but the background
in Rhodesia is also a shame.

839
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,999
Of course it is,

840
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,999
I mean no one likes

841
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,500
oppression and violence, but…

842
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
You think it’s a shame that the

843
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:55,000
demonstrators were so aggressive?

844
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I think it’s a shame

845
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,499
that people are oppressed.

846
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,499
I think it's a shame

847
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,250
that there’s fighting and violence.

848
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,000
I think people should get along.

849
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,500
Yes, it’s a nice thought.

850
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Then, I feel, that it’s difficult to

851
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,000
take a position, either for or against.

852
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,000
I see, but the fact that the tennis match
didn’t take place,

853
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,999
do you think that’s also a shame?

854
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,500
I don’t think I know enough
about it to say yes or no.

855
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,500
Fine; thank you.

856
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I was actually involved,

857
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,000
on the tennis side of it.

858
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,499
Hired for the competition

859
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,000
as an umpire.

860
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,000
As far as I’m concerned it was terrible.

861
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,000
It was a shock to see that people

862
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,500
could behave the way they did.

863
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,250
You’re talking primarily about
the demonstrators?

864
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,000
Yes, that’s right,
the unofficial demonstrators,

865
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,000
or whatever you want to call them.

866
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,000
How about the other demonstrators?

867
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,499
Well, I think they behaved

868
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,499
absolutely properly, so there was nothing wrong there.

869
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,499
Do you also feel that you can’t

870
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,000
separate sports and politics?

871
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,199
Well, I’ve been involved

872
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,000
in sports my entire life.

873
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,000
So I’d certainly like
to keep them separate.

874
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,999
Do you feel that that’s the right thing to do

875
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,999
to do in the case of Rhodesia,

876
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
where black people
don’t have access to tennis?

877
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,199
I can’t personally know what it’s like.

878
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,499
There are bad things

879
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,499
going on in various countries,

880
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,500
that’s what we all feel,

881
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,999
Oppression on one side and the other.

882
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
We even do it here in Sweden.

883
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
We oppress the gypsies.

884
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,000
So I don’t want to pass
judgment in this case.

885
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,999
if you’re from a country where
they behave that way then…

886
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Well, it's awful.

887
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,000
Have you read the paper today?

888
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,100
I certainly have.
I’m going to read a few more.

889
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,199
And do you think the description

890
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,500
of the whole thing
was correct and relevant?

891
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,500
I do. But of course
they do have differing views.

892
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
Political opinions and views.

893
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,750
Yes, they vary,

894
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,500
They vary considerably, I think, actually.

895
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,200
They're saying it's the worst
since 1909.

896
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I didn’t read that newspaper,
but I saw the headline,

897
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,900
Do you also feel that way?

898
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I've never experienced
anything this bad.

899
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,000
I met Sven Jerring yesterday.

900
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,250
He said he had experienced
the Russian Revolution.

901
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,000
and that was the worst thing

902
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,000
he’d ever experienced,
so far that is.

903
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,500
but it was pretty close.

904
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,500
This wasn't that bad, he said,

905
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,500
We were certainly shocked.

906
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,250
You think so?

907
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,750
Absolutely. Many of us.

908
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,000
What did you think of
the demonstration?

909
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Didn't care for it.

910
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
Not the least bit.

911
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,999
Why do you think one
shouldn’t mix sports with politics?

912
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,500
I think they’re two
completely separate things.

913
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,700
Why’s that?

914
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,500
Well...

915
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,700
In what way?

916
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,200
I don't know how to put it,

917
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,000
Sports is one thing
and politics another.

918
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,500
That's what I think, anyway.

919
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,999
If the demonstrators felt

920
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,499
that stopping the match

921
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,499
would help the Rhodesian blacks,

922
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,000
do you think it was the right

923
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,499
thing to do in that case,

924
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,500
if they were firmly convinced of it?

925
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Is it right then to fight for it?

926
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,499
Of course, if they hold
a proper demonstration.

927
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,000
But this was more like a riot,
you might say.

928
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,500
Were you down there
yourself to look at it?

929
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
No, I wasn’t.

930
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,250
No.

931
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,499
It's disgusting that they

932
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:14,999
should be allowed

933
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
to behave that way down in Båstad,

934
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,999
that they should be allowed to

935
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
come here and spoil things.

936
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,500
All the disturbance
they caused out there.

937
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,500
Well, that’s how we feel about it,

938
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
how most people around here feel,
I guess.

939
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,999
The local residents have been upset

940
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,500
by their presence down here,

941
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,000
their shameless behavior and all.

942
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,999
They say that a number of Båstad residents

943
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,999
went up to teach those

944
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,999
demonstrators a lesson? Is that true?

945
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I don’t know anything about that.

946
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,499
There are a whole lot of cars here.

947
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,000
Do you know why that is?

948
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,499
Well, they're curious.

949
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,000
There was a bit of a brawl
happening here.

950
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,500
There still is.

951
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,750
What kind of a brawl?

952
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,500
The youths of Båstad
are trying to get hold

953
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:07,000
of the students,
to teach them a lesson.

954
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,500
Teach them a lesson?
In what way?

955
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
They don't like them..

956
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,999
And want to have it out with them.

957
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Make life unpleasant for them.

958
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Did anything happen yesterday?

959
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Yeah, from what I heard

960
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,000
there was a bit of a brawl last night.

961
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,500
A brawl? What happened?

962
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,499
They used ladders to try and get up to

963
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,000
where they were staying

964
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,000
to get them out.
At the station, too.

965
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
They threw rocks at the Båstad kids,

966
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
tried to hit their cars and that.

967
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,999
There were a hundred and fifty men

968
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,500
who tried to head over to the building,

969
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,999
and then one of their leaders
showed up

970
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,999
and drove them down there by car

971
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
which got pelted by rocks.

972
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,700
A hundred and fifty, who were they?

973
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,000
They were from Båstad
and all around here.

974
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,000
What did they do?

975
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,499
They wanted to go up there
and get them all out

976
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,200
Who?

977
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
The students.

978
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,500
What were they going to do with them?

979
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,000
I don't know, but the parking lot here
was full of cars.

980
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,000
Did you hear anything about it?

981
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,499
I heard they were out here

982
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,500
trying to get them out of the building

983
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
so they could beat them up.

984
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,000
Beat them up?

985
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,600
How many were they?

986
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I have no idea how many they were.

987
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Like... twenty-five cars.

988
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,000
Police cars?

989
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:33,000
No. Ordinary, private cars.

990
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,500
Where did those cars come from?

991
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,000
From around here, around Båstad.

992
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,000
So what else happened?

993
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,550
Well, they went up there,
but they were gone.

994
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,999
There had been a police car
up there earlier

995
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,999
to pick up a few of them, they thought,

996
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
but when they got up there,

997
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
the lights were switched off,
they couldn't see anybody.

998
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Were you here yourself?

999
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,750
And saw everything?

1000
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,999
Would you like to tell us
what you're doing here, today?

1001
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,900
Now?

1002
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:08,000
Well, we came to see what…
…if there are any students.

1003
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,500
If there are any students?

1004
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,999
They say that there were

1005
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,499
students demonstrating here in Båstad

1006
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,000
against the match.

1007
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Do you have any comments on that?

1008
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I don’t think they should
drag politics into sports.

1009
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Why not, do you think?

1010
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,200
Well, they don't belong together.

1011
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I feel the same way.

1012
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,999
They say that the demonstrators’ bus
was destroyed yesterday.

1013
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,500
How do you feel about that?

1014
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I think it's good.

1015
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,000
Why?

1016
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,999
Well, they deserve to get a taste
of their own medicine,

1017
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,500
for destroying the tennis courts.

1018
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,999
They say that the demonstrators’ bus
was destroyed;

1019
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,750
is that true?

1020
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,550
Yes.

1021
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,200
How do you feel about that?

1022
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,750
That's good.

1023
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,450
Why do you think that's good?

1024
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,999
When they come down here

1025
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,449
to demonstrate against a match,

1026
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:58,000
then they should get
some payback, I think.

1027
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:59,549
Come down here
all the way from Stockholm

1028
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:00,499
just to demonstrate
against something like that,

1029
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,300
it's idiotic. Ridiculous.

1030
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,500
Why do you think
they were demonstrating?

1031
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,000
For the rights of the blacks.

1032
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,700
Excuse me?

1033
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,500
For the rights of the blacks.

1034
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
No, look,
I have nothing against blacks.

1035
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,999
I think that in the US, for example,

1036
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,500
there the blacks should have their rights,
as they should everywhere.

1037
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,000
But I mean, they can't do anything.

1038
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
If the UN can't, they can't.

1039
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
They managed to stop the match anyway.

1040
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
Sure, but it doesn't make
any difference.

1041
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I mean, they're going to play anyway.

1042
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,200
It's a tradition.
It's ruined in that sense.

1043
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,500
You saw the demonstration yesterday.

1044
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
What did you think was wrong about it?

1045
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I did not see it.

1046
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,499
I was only there for a short while,

1047
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,740
then I drove home again.

1048
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
If they had to demonstrate,

1049
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,000
then they could have done it
peacefully.

1050
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And not gotten so violent.

1051
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,749
What do you think about
the demonstration

1052
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,500
yesterday, here in Båstad?

1053
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It was awful.

1054
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,250
It sure was; bloody awful.

1055
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,500
It was ridiculous.

1056
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,500
It was so childish,
like nothing I've ever seen before.

1057
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,500
Why’s that, do you think?

1058
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,500
Well, I’ll tell you; because it’s
absolutely unnecessary

1059
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
to demonstrate like that.
I don't understand why.

1060
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:16,999
You think it was unneccesary?

1061
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Of course it was unnecessary.

1062
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,000
What do you think
of the demonstration yesterday?

1063
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:23,999
I didn't like it.

1064
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
You shouldn’t mix politics with sports.

1065
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Those kids should have stayed home.

1066
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,499
Should politics and
sports be kept separate?

1067
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,000
Yes, definitely.

1068
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:32,999
Why?

1069
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Well, because if you
can't keep it out of sports,

1070
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,000
you can't keep it out
of anything.

1071
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,500
I feel the same.

1072
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Politics, sports, separate.

1073
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,000
Why have so many people
gathered here today?

1074
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,999
Well, I'll tell you

1075
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,999
we followed you here.

1076
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
We thought you belonged to
that group, see.

1077
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,999
We spotted you along the way,

1078
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,500
And saw that you were headed
up to Ekmans,

1079
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,499
so we drove into town

1080
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,000
and gathered some people together.

1081
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,700
You were going to beat us up?

1082
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:03,599
No, not beat you up,

1083
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,999
but if that gang had been up at Ekmans,

1084
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,999
then we would have stood there

1085
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
and stopped them from leaving.

1086
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,999
But unfortunately they ran off

1087
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
last night or this afternoon.

1088
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I agree with the lady here,
that’s absolutely true.

1089
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,999
We think they should

1090
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
have been forced to stay on,

1091
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,000
for at least one more night.

1092
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,499
What for?

1093
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,999
They ought to suffer

1094
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
some kind of punishment.

1095
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,499
I think they must have

1096
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,500
been very scared up there.

1097
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,499
Why else would they have run

1098
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,500
outside and hidden in the bushes?

1099
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,999
As soon as the people came up there,

1100
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,999
they ran off, out into the bushes,

1101
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,999
and they were huddled out there
until we left again.

1102
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,499
And that's how they've
been carrying on all night.

1103
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,500
We were up there with flashlights.

1104
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,999
They were afraid.
Just terribly afraid.

1105
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,999
Did something happen yesterday?

1106
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,499
I wasn’t here in the evening,
so I don’t know.

1107
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,000
But there were a lot of cars
driving around here

1108
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
People were aggressive.

1109
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,500
Very aggressive.

1110
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,000
Why do you think
they demonstrated?

1111
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,500
They don’t know what they’re doing.

1112
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,800
Just a bunch of idiots.

1113
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:05,500
Brats. Cowards.

1114
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:07,750
Why do you say that?

1115
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Why they're cowards?

1116
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,200
If they weren't cowards
they would have stayed.

1117
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,999
They’re all well-off,
too, most of them.

1118
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,999
They live here in the summer.

1119
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,250
They ought to behave themselves.

1120
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,400
Why shouldn't one mix
sports with politics?

1121
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,500
They’re two different things,
completely different.

1122
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:27,200
In what way?

1123
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,999
Well, you shouldn’t…
I can’t explain it,

1124
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
but they shouldn't mix
sports and politics.

1125
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,000
Do you know why
they were demonstrating?

1126
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,499
The thing is,
they should go down there

1127
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,500
instead of demonstrating here.

1128
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
They’ve only got two players
down here, after all.

1129
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
They shouldn’t demonstrate against them;

1130
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,000
in that case they should take up politics,

1131
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,999
not against the players down here.

1132
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,499
They can take it up to the government

1133
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,999
in Stockholm and talk about it
up there instead.

1134
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,999
And then we’re going to vote
for the right party down here,

1135
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,500
so we don’t have
any of those demonstrations.

1136
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,500
Which party is the right one?

1137
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,499
Well, the Conservatives are,
for me anyway.

1138
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,000
I'm not afraid to admit it.

1139
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,499
You’re trying to get ahold

1140
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,499
of the demonstrators?

1141
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,500
Sure, why not shut them up
in there for a while?

1142
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
What do the police have to
say about that?

1143
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,999
I don't care.

1144
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,999
We're not going to do anything to them.

1145
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,750
Absolutely nothing.

1146
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,749
We can show them how to
demonstrate properly;

1147
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,000
calmly and peacefully, not like they did -

1148
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,999
coming at the police with iron bars

1149
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,999
and rocks and what have you.

1150
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They got off scot-free.

1151
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,999
We had every opportunity last night

1152
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,999
to destroy that building up there,

1153
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
but we didn’t do anything.

1154
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,000
We didn’t even touch a single
blade of grass up there,

1155
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,999
Have the police been here?

1156
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,500
Yes, there’s been plenty of police.

1157
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,999
What did they want?

1158
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
They just looked around.

1159
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,000
Was that wrong?

1160
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,500
No, it wasn't wrong...

1161
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Everyone has a right to protection.

1162
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,499
How far do you think
the police should go?

1163
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,250
Should they shoot?

1164
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,199
No,
but there are excellent water cannons,

1165
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,200
stuff like that they can use.

1166
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,900
Did you see the demonstration?

1167
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,000
No, I didn’t unfortunately.

1168
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
…they were going to ruin

1169
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,000
the whole damn tennis court down there.

1170
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,399
And they were going to ruin things for
the white devil.

1171
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,000
There was a black guy here
declaring that.

1172
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,500
So there's proof of that.

1173
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:12,900
Why do you think he thought that?

1174
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,550
Well, I don't know.

1175
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,499
But that guy was going to university

1176
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,000
in Stockholm or in Uppsala,

1177
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,500
he had money from the Swedish state

1178
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
to go to school here,
and have his living costs paid for.

1179
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,499
And he comes down here

1180
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,500
and ruins things for us,

1181
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
comparing us to Ian Smith and all them.

1182
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,000
I don’t think that’s fair to us…

1183
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,999
And for people like that
to act like hooligans…

1184
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,499
why, that just ruins things
for all young people.

1185
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:45,000
The clique that gets seen,
they’re the ones that ruin things.

1186
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Then it’s the decent kids
that get blamed for it.

1187
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,499
We’ve been over to see Henry Swaving

1188
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,999
and signed a list that he's going

1189
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,999
to send the government,

1190
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,249
that the police should be given
greater authority

1191
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,000
when it comes to these
kinds of demonstrations.

1192
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,250
"Greater authority" -
what does that mean?

1193
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,999
Well, to be able to respond
with a firmer hand,

1194
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:03,999
when it's really necessary.

1195
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,499
And it is necessary sometimes,

1196
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,200
as we just saw.

1197
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:07,200
Do the rest of you feel that way, too?

1198
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,000
Y E S!

1199
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,000
You’ve drawn up a petition
to the government.

1200
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,199
What does it say?

1201
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,200
HENRY SWAVING,
GOLD MERCHANT

1202
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,000
Here's what it says.

1203
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,999
Due to the chaos that took place,

1204
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,750
and I am in no way a leader

1205
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
of the Båstad residents.

1206
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,000
I am just a citizen
who wants to help other citizens.

1207
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,500
This petition consists of the following:

1208
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,500
We, the undersigned
residents of Båstad,

1209
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,499
have looked on in dismay at the events

1210
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,000
that took place in our town

1211
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
in conjunction with the demonstrations

1212
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
that were held here on 2 May 1968,

1213
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,499
when Sweden was supposed

1214
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,000
to meet Rhodesia in a tennis match.

1215
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
The police made worthy
attempts to keep order.

1216
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,999
Unfortunately,
they lacked the authority

1217
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,500
to use the necessary means
that could have

1218
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
effectively put a stop to the hooliganism.

1219
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,500
Therefore,
we petition the government forthwith

1220
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,000
to provide the police command

1221
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,000
with such authority.
If this does not happen,

1222
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,000
we fear for what we might experience

1223
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,000
in our town in the future.

1224
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,000
How far do you feel the police should go?

1225
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,000
How much authority should they have,
do you think?

1226
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,499
I can't comment on what authority

1227
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,000
the police should be given

1228
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,000
if hooligans attack a community;

1229
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
That's for the government to comment on.

1230
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,500
Even if it means being armed?

1231
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,999
Then the government should

1232
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,999
make absolutely sure

1233
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,999
no such elements

1234
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
are allowed into the country,

1235
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,200
so it doesn't lead to armed conflict.

1236
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,499
Because Sweden hasn't gone

1237
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,000
completely communist yet,
I hope.

1238
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,499
There’s quite a brisk flow of traffic

1239
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,500
out to an area over by Hovs Hallar,

1240
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,499
where some demonstrators are

1241
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,499
supposed to be holed up.

1242
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,500
Do you know anything about that?

1243
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yes, some of them were still there.

1244
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,500
These black groups,
that belong to the FNL,

1245
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,499
who were very aggressive at the gates.

1246
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,000
Båstad residents got wind of this

1247
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
and really wanted to get ahold
of those... types.

1248
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,499
Yesterday there were at least

1249
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,000
a hundred youths there.

1250
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,000
Then I went over there myself

1251
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,000
with the editor of the Kvällsposten,

1252
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,000
Buhre, his name is.

1253
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Birger Buhr. Then, after a
five or six minute discussion

1254
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,000
between Birger Buhr
and this demonstrator,

1255
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,499
it looked like it was

1256
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,000
really going to turn into a lynching.

1257
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,499
Then one of the police officers

1258
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,499
asked if I wouldn’t get involved,

1259
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,000
to try and calm the whole thing down.

1260
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,000
So I showed a bit of aggressiveness,

1261
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,999
and told off a few of

1262
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
those stupid demonstrators

1263
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:06,000
and finally I said:
Come on, people of Båstad,

1264
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,000
let's not be as disorderly

1265
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,000
as these rowdy people.

1266
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,999
Let’s go home and I’ll treat
everyone to some refreshment.

1267
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,900
And with that,
everyone came along quietly.

1268
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,499
KLING: NOW WE REALLY
HAVE TO STOP AND THINK

1269
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,000
Has the police commissioner
been informed about what happened?

1270
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,499
It was through him
that I got the information I have,

1271
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,500
beyond what I learned through the

1272
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
southern Swedish press.

1273
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,500
And may I ask you then whether

1274
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,500
he has changed your view

1275
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,000
of how similar incidents should be handled?

1276
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,499
The police commissioner

1277
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,500
has clearly stated that from his point of view,

1278
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
a greater commitment of personnel

1279
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,499
could have prevented any violence

1280
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,500
from breaking out altogether.

1281
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,999
In the press the following day

1282
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,999
it was intimated
that the police are going

1283
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,999
to be given greater authority.

1284
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Would you care to comment on that?

1285
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,000
It was Kling who said it,

1286
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,999
that the National Police Board

1287
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,499
would be given greater authority.

1288
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,499
I find it pretty shameful

1289
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,499
that that's the first thing
Kling has to say

1290
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,000
about this whole business
with Rhodesia.

1291
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,899
One would expect that he,

1292
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,100
as the government's expert
on legal issues,

1293
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,000
ought to be able
to comment on the fact

1294
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,499
that we have signed up to a boycott

1295
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,500
against Rhodesia in the UN,

1296
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,500
about the breaking of the pledge we made

1297
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,500
to Rhodesia's colored population,

1298
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
not to support the Smith regime,

1299
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,999
and about the crime that allowing
a tennis match against Rhodesia

1300
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
within Sweden entails.

1301
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,499
Everything else,

1302
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,999
the confrontations that broke out here

1303
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,500
before the match,

1304
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,999
are seocndary in comparison

1305
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
to the moral treachery that it involves

1306
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:59,000
to formally allow the Smith regime

1307
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,000
to gain recognition by playing
a national match against Rhodesia.

1308
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,500
And that’s where I think

1309
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,999
Kling should have been upset,

1310
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
instead of coming along

1311
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,999
afterwards and being upset
about secondary consequences.

1312
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:12,999
If the police were to use

1313
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,500
harsher methods in the future,

1314
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,250
what do you think that would mean?

1315
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,500
It's a very alarming development.

1316
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,999
But it seems as if things
are headed in that direction.

1317
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,500
You can see it in a lot
of different areas,

1318
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
if you look at the subway
in Stockholm now,

1319
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,999
and the new city centre

1320
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
that's been built for banks and cars,

1321
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,999
not for people.

1322
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,999
That causes anxiety,

1323
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,250
because people want to
have somewhere to go.

1324
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,250
But then instead of grappling
with the root causes,

1325
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,049
they just try to crush

1326
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:42,999
any expressions of discontent

1327
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,950
through TV coverage

1328
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
and tougher police action.

1329
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,999
I think we face a period of difficult

1330
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
re-evaluation in this country,

1331
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,000
and throughout the West,

1332
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
and that it could be the beginning

1333
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,000
of a very unpleasant development,

1334
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,999
instead of facing up

1335
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
to the new situation,

1336
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
they try to crush
expressions of dissatisfaction.

1337
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,500
KLING ON THE RIOTS:
STOP THE HOOLIGANS

1338
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,999
I heard now
that justice minister Kling

1339
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
made a statement

1340
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,000
in Svenska Dagladet,

1341
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,000
where he called us
a bunch of hooligans.

1342
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,000
I find this to be a very
worrying situation and tendency,

1343
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,000
because it reveals the enormous lack

1344
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,500
of information that the public and press,

1345
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,999
and everyone else has

1346
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
about who the demonstrators are.

1347
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,499
I think it’s really awful

1348
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,000
to see the role of the press
in this respect,

1349
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
how they continue
to fan these prejudices,

1350
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,999
how they’re engaging
in a persecution propaganda

1351
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
against the demonstrators.

1352
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,250
The combination of increased police authority,

1353
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
increased police violence,

1354
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,999
and increased politicization
of the police

1355
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
is what I find to be
the most frightening.

1356
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,000
When you can see
Sven Davidson,

1357
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:56,500
who is just beneath Wallenberg,

1358
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,999
giving orders to the police,

1359
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:58,999
who they should attack,

1360
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,999
where they should be put in,

1361
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,999
and at the same time the police
just say

1362
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,999
they have no opinion on this,

1363
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,500
but are controlled
by a political force,

1364
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,499
then I think it's dangerous

1365
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,000
to give them more authority.

1366
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Instead they ought to examine

1367
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,499
what exactly the police
are supposed to defend,

1368
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,499
what role they should have,

1369
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,250
and not just let them

1370
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
be politicized freely.

1371
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,000
That’s what Kling should be doing.

1372
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,999
The Swedish Tennis Association
issued a communiqué

1373
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
that read more or less as follows:

1374
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
We will not reveal where
the Rhodesia match

1375
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,499
is going to be played
until after it has been played.

1376
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,000
Do you feel that to be an
especially appropriate formulation?

1377
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
No, it certainly isn’t.

1378
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,000
Because ... ?

1379
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Well, if you really feel compelled to play,

1380
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,499
what I would consider

1381
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,500
a rather superfluous tournament,

1382
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
then surely you ought to at least

1383
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,500
do it in such a way that people can
see it, if they want to.

1384
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,500
No, I don’t want to speak
at length on this,

1385
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,499
other than to describe
the formal situation,

1386
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:41,000
and where we stand on principle.

1387
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,000
But like I said,
they can enter the country

1388
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,500
and organizations are allowed
to organize events.

1389
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,999
Without the Swedish government

1390
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,499
being able to stop it?

1391
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,000
Yes.

1392
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Okay. Thank you.

1393
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,499
The match was ultimately played
in Bandole, France.

1394
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,000
Final result:
Sweden-Rhodesia, 3-2.
