1
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,739
This is X100 to Golden Rod.

2
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,860
X100 to Golden Rod.
Do you read me? Over.

3
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,480
Normal descent on instruments...
Normal descent on instruments.

4
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,540
Altitude 90,000 feet.

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,620
Approaching critical velocity.

6
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,660
Something's wrong,
I'm falling too fast!

7
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,140
Golden Rod, I'm in trouble!
The jets don't break my speed!

8
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm releasing the drag chute!

9
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,040
The ship feels five hundred
pounds heavier!

10
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,380
There's no drag and I'm getting
too close to the Earth!

11
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,300
There's nothing more I can do now.

12
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,060
Estimate impact radius

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,700
ten miles northeast your location.

14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,780
In case recorder's damaged,
get this...

15
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,180
Velocity 6,700 miles.

16
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,460
Weight ratio 187.

17
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,280
Thrust 220 tons.

18
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,540
I'll, uh...

19
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,300
I'll tell the others.

20
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,880
Golden Rod Baker to
Golden Rod Abel.

21
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,840
Golden Rod Baker to
Golden Rod Abel.

22
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,880
Golden Rod Baker to
Golden Rod Abel.

23
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,440
Golden Rod Baker to
Golden Rod Abel.

24
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,619
Did you find it? Came down about

25
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,700
three miles east of Walker's Pass,

26
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,680
area 116 and 117 on your map.

27
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,520
How bad is he?

28
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,780
He bought it all the way.

29
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,220
You're certain?

30
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
No respiration, no heartbeat,
no pulse.

31
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,000
Came down pretty hard.

32
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,240
The rocket unit's
still in one piece and

33
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,020
most of the control section.

34
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,740
Everything else is scattered
around for about half a mile.

35
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,179
Tell Donna to cover
the entire area.

36
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,540
Canaveral will want all the
visual data we can give them.

37
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,180
Oh, and,

38
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,880
don't move anything
till we get there.

39
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,680
Golden Rod Baker, out.

40
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm terribly sorry, Julie.

41
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,600
I understand how you feel.

42
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,740
But we can't let that interfere
with the work we have to do.

43
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,920
You both knew it was
a calculated risk.

44
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,960
I'll be all right, Doctor.

45
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,080
Well, let's get going.

46
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,900
Dave...

47
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,380
Look at the composition
of this mud.

48
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,079
Dr. Wyman wants you
to get full coverage

49
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,320
on the entire area.

50
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,959
This is your first project
under Dr. Wyman,

51
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,160
wasn't it?

52
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Yeah.

53
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,800
I helped to design the
Jettison Unit that didn't work.

54
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,999
On a project like this
there's always a

55
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,060
margin for error, you expect it.

56
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Sure.

57
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,839
Then when it comes,
you find you really

58
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,200
didn't expect it after all.

59
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,499
You think Julie expected it,

60
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,260
with his engagement
ring on her finger?

61
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,419
John Corcoran was the
first man to be sent

62
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,500
up in a satellite and
ejected back to Earth.

63
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
Only he was supposed
to come back alive.

64
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,620
Let's check the rest of it.

65
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,460
Look, Dave...

66
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,300
Look...

67
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,060
Don't blame yourself.

68
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,100
The answer lies in this wreckage.

69
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's recheck the crash pattern.

70
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,980
Well, that's funny. What's that?

71
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,500
This rip was smaller when
we first got here.

72
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,799
Would the stress of
settling into the ground

73
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,940
have widened it?

74
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,359
How could that be,
the entire hull

75
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,000
is made of magneuridium alloy?

76
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,680
I'd like to examine the body
before we bring it out.

77
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,120
All right.

78
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,160
Watch you don't cut yourself, Doctor.

79
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,619
Dr. Benson, come here quickly!

80
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,980
Bring my bag!

81
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,740
I want you see this.

82
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,100
How long would you
say he's been dead?

83
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,840
It's been at least
three hours since the crash.

84
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,280
Over three hours and no sign
of body rigidity.

85
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,980
No skin discoloration.

86
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,080
Temperature feels normal.

87
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,560
No dilation whatsoever.

88
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,800
The cause of death must be
due to an internal rupture.

89
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,179
I've never seen an
internally damaged body

90
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,500
with no sign of rigor mortis
after so long.

91
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,359
Let's get him back to the lab

92
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,060
so we can continue the examination.

93
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,700
Help Dr. Wyman.

94
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
He wants to take John
back to the lab.

95
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,714
Right.

96
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
Dave, get a blanket.

97
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,139
Hello Everglade, hello Everglade,

98
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,999
this is Golden Rod,
this is Golden Rod.

99
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,280
How do you receive? Over.

100
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,700
Aren't they receiving it?

101
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,700
That's not the question.

102
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,440
Are we transmitting?

103
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,039
They don't receive
anything from us they

104
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,759
won't try and reach us
until the frequency check

105
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,920
at nine o'clock.

106
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,440
By all medical standards,
this man is dead.

107
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,860
No heartbeat, no respiration.

108
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,060
Yet his tissues refuse to dissipate.

109
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,519
Well is it possible
he could be in a

110
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,340
kind of catatonic state?

111
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,940
Could he still be alive?

112
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,700
Perhaps a form of hypometabolism?

113
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,160
That's impossible.

114
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,840
His heart has stopped,
there's no circulation.

115
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,579
You know as well as
I do that when this

116
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,159
process stops the brain
starts to

117
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,780
deteriorate almost at once.

118
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,100
Within a matter of
three minutes it dies.

119
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,639
Hello Everglade, hello Everglade,

120
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,079
this is Golden Rod,
this is Golden Rod.

121
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,460
How do you receive? Over.

122
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,939
Maybe after this long
a radio silence

123
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,000
they'll switch over to
an emergency channel.

124
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,060
I've already tried that.

125
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,280
How about the Air Force?

126
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,179
Hello Air Force Emergency,

127
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,980
this is special CQD
Golden Rod station.

128
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,500
How do you receive? Over.

129
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,539
Everything's all fouled up here.

130
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,780
I couldn't receive the spot
weather report on this thing.

131
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, but are you
sure it's not your set?

132
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,900
No, I've already checked everything.

133
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,619
Will you go out and ask Steve

134
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,860
to come in here minute? Sure.

135
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,299
Hello Everglade, hello Everglade,

136
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,079
this is Golden Rod,
this is Golden Rod.

137
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
Do you receive? Over.

138
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,180
Nothing, Doctor.

139
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,040
Doctor!

140
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
What is it?

141
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,740
It's not a lesion.

142
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,079
It's more like something
had been forced

143
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,100
through the tissue at a high pressure.

144
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
Steve...

145
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,720
The radio still won't work.

146
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,000
Dave wants to see you.

147
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,400
Okay.

148
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,860
I'll bet they're going
nuts at the Cape.

149
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,180
Get that radio working, Steve.

150
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,640
We're going to need assistance.

151
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,860
What's the trouble?

152
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,260
I can't transmit across
the room with this thing.

153
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,780
It sounds like a magnetic disturbance.

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,940
Yeah. Could be the power
line's fouled up outside.

155
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,480
What's happening in there?

156
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,260
I don't know.

157
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
Somehow we've got to get
through to the Cape.

158
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,919
Five hours overdue now.

159
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,240
I bet half the brass in the
State of Florida is up in arms.

160
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,579
I hope not, if enough
people find out

161
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,640
about this we'll have
everybody up here.

162
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,019
I'll check the tower.

163
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,159
You stay here and keep
trying to get through,

164
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,600
will you? Yeah.

165
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,580
Look, if you pick up anything,
give a yell.

166
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,680
Right.

167
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,820
Blood pressure 120 over 80.

168
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,980
Normal for a living man.

169
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,416
That's impossible, Doctor,
you must have a mistake.

170
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,380
But Doctor, I checked it twice.

171
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,040
This man does have normal pressure.

172
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,380
That's impossible.

173
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,320
Take a blood sample,
I'll make a radiation count.

174
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,720
Golden Rod to Everglade.

175
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,820
Golden Rod to Everglade.

176
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,840
Come in Everglade, over.

177
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,039
Golden Rod to Everglade,
come in Everglade.

178
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,340
This is an emergency!

179
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,340
Steve?

180
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,540
Are you okay, Dave? Yeah...

181
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,020
What happened?

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,140
Something hit me.

183
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,800
It was big, like a bear.

184
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,539
It came from out of
the darkness and was

185
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,720
heading for the lab.

186
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,700
I know I put a couple of shots
in it before I went down.

187
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,240
A wounded animal at
large isn't good.

188
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,920
How well are we armed?

189
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,380
Well, besides these pistols
we've got a couple of rifles.

190
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,516
I think it headed toward the
back of the building.

191
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,579
Dave...

192
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,140
Are you sure you're all right?

193
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,920
Yeah, yeah, he just clipped me.

194
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,320
Inside!

195
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,200
It's in the medical room!
Wait a minute.

196
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,980
At the windows!

197
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,640
Donna, get the other lanterns.

198
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,040
Did it get to him?

199
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
No...

200
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,180
What do you think it was?

201
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,179
Well this didn't come off any bear.

202
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,780
Bring the light over here,
will you?

203
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,900
No fur, no blood.

204
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,760
Very much like leather.

205
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,820
Is the power out completely?

206
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,639
Yes, it is.

207
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
You have any idea what caused it?

208
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,900
It could be a break
in the cable at the dam, or

209
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,960
a short circuit in one of the transformers.

210
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,340
Dave, are you sure the building
was thoroughly checked?

211
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,260
Are the wiring and fuses all right?

212
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,859
I went over everything thoroughly,

213
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,040
I checked everything.

214
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
I'll check again.

215
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,240
Nothing's wrong here.

216
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,039
Like I said, it's probably the

217
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,320
disturbance up at the dam.

218
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,440
Well Steve need some
help boarding the window.

219
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,440
All right.

220
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,960
Well, at least we won't freeze.

221
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,339
You'd think a place
like this would be

222
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,580
equipped with heating.

223
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,359
Up until a few months
ago this was

224
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,900
a radar monitoring station.

225
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,419
Most of the ultra sensitive instruments

226
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,220
respond better to the cooler atmosphere.

227
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,680
Systolic was 140.

228
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll have a blood sample for
you in a few minutes.

229
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,399
How long do you think it'll
take Canaveral to realize

230
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,380
we're incommunicado and send aid?

231
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,839
Well, with a security
operation as tight as this,

232
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,300
maybe another twelve hours.

233
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,660
That could mean we could
be here another day.

234
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,800
Doctor... Doctor!

235
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,320
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

236
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,640
Notice the way it's
fighting the others.

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Seven hours and his
blood is still alive.

238
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,519
One of us will have to drive
to the nearest telephone

239
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,640
and call the Cape.

240
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Every minute counts. What is it?

241
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,439
I've seen amoebic dominance
of a cell

242
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,620
structure before, but

243
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,740
this is completely out of proportion.

244
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,400
Well what are they,
what do they mean?

245
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,780
Well, normal blood
has two basic cells.

246
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,899
The red carry oxygen

247
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,400
and the white fight infection.

248
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,540
But this blood has three,

249
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,520
the third cell.. That big one..

250
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Well,

251
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
that's completely foreign
to any blood structure.

252
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,260
If that bacterioid is contagious,

253
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,159
then we've all been exposed.

254
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,780
I doubt if it's communicable.

255
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,820
We'd better get to
the nearest town, fast.

256
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,779
I imagine that'd be Desert City.

257
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,640
But that's over thirty miles,
isn't there anything closer?

258
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,240
There's nothing on the map.

259
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Steve,

260
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
call the Cape from Desert City.

261
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,160
Get in touch with Dr. Zimmerman.

262
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,940
Don't go into detail.

263
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,539
Just tell him to get
here as quickly as he can.

264
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,900
Well what about equipment?

265
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,840
Well, we'll need a new power supply,

266
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,300
and a refrigerated truck or an
ambulance to transport the body.

267
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,300
Oh, and

268
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,419
tell him to request priority clearance

269
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,196
directly to Walter Reed
Hospital in Washington.

270
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,940
Right. I'll be back
as soon as I can.

271
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,900
Keep checking the blood
pressure, Doctor.

272
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,120
The last count was 140 over 80.

273
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,240
Well, that's all we can
do at the present.

274
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,780
Any luck with the Jeep?

275
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,940
I can't figure it out.

276
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,139
The cars, and both
the truck and the Jeep,

277
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,300
are burned out.

278
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,440
It stopped.
They're both stopped.

279
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,580
Take a look.

280
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,540
We're in a magnetic force field.
A what?

281
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,880
A net of static electricity is
surrounding the entire area.

282
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,520
That's why our power's dead.

283
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Well, we're not going
anywhere tonight.

284
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,740
The truck and the Jeep are
burned out electrically.

285
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,840
What would cause a thing like that?

286
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,139
There's a very powerful
magnetic source

287
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,300
somewhere nearby.

288
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,580
It's reversing all positive
electrical power.

289
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,480
Dr. Wyman, how close is the
satellite compartment?

290
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,619
Two, maybe three miles.

291
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,079
I was just thinking,
is it possible that

292
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,699
the compartment could be bombarded

293
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,100
with electron particles?

294
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,899
Well it could be,
it's happened before

295
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,020
on some of the earlier
Snark firings at the Cape.

296
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,039
When the missiles came back
to Earth

297
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,880
they were pretty heavily magnetized.

298
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,540
But there's a mountain range
between us and the compartment.

299
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,739
Yeah, well there doesn't seem
to be

300
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,240
any logic behind any of this.

301
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,160
Well here's something to
complicate things even more.

302
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,659
This was a shot I took
when Dave and I

303
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,879
first got out there.

304
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,260
Look at it closely.

305
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,619
Dave, remember I mentioned
the strange mud?

306
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,700
Yes.

307
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,680
Well this was the last shot taken.

308
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,100
Most of the mud has disappeared
and the opening is larger.

309
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,839
Yes, I remember that when we took

310
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,120
John out of the compartment.

311
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,320
But at the time it
didn't seem important.

312
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,600
Well someone or something
must have been there.

313
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,581
There's an explanation,
and a good one, for all of this.

314
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,260
There must be.

315
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,479
Some of the things that
have occurred today

316
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,780
are without precedent.

317
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,480
A man in there alive
that should be dead,

318
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,620
something that's never
happened before.

319
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,479
Well, we've never sent
a man so far

320
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,760
into space before.

321
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,540
Well, we're all tired,

322
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,140
disappointed,

323
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,380
and under a terrible strain.

324
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,639
After this long the Cape

325
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,179
has probably contacted the Pentagon,

326
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,320
it's just a matter of time.

327
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,780
What if they can't get through?

328
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,180
The magnetic force field
works both ways.

329
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,499
Well, in the morning one
of us will have to

330
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,620
hike down and meet them.

331
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,139
As a precautionary measure
I suggest we all

332
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,660
stay in this room tonight.

333
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,500
Steve and Dave and I will
take turns watching Corcoran.

334
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Right.

335
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,620
Julie, Julie...

336
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,020
I'm sorry, Doctor.

337
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,600
I just can't hold it back any longer.

338
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,880
I know.

339
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,500
I wish there was something
I could say.

340
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,640
I'll listen, if you like.

341
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,540
It's bad enough losing
someone you love.

342
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,240
But this?

343
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,400
The unknown.

344
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm being held here.

345
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,800
Alex, I don't...

346
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,920
Julie...

347
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,300
Julie,

348
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,060
he alone stood on the
threshold of our future.

349
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,980
From what happened
to him today we may

350
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,900
learn more than we've ever known.

351
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
Maybe I should just listen.

352
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,060
It's so incongruous.

353
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,140
He's dead.

354
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,280
But is he dead?

355
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,879
As scientists, the more we learn,

356
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,600
the more we realize there is
to learn.

357
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,820
Life itself is the greatest miracle.

358
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Well,

359
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,519
when we get him to the
hospital tomorrow,

360
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,760
maybe we'll know.

361
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,520
Good night, Doctor.

362
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,880
Good night, Julie.

363
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
Dave! What is it?

364
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,460
I think I hear something in there.

365
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,680
The light's out.

366
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
Dr. Wyman.

367
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,160
Half his head's gone.

368
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,640
Dr. Wyman!

369
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,500
There's nothing you can do!

370
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,560
It must have taken the body.

371
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,960
Whatever it is, it works fast.

372
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,440
Let's take him down.

373
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,840
Steve...

374
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,820
Help him to the table.

375
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,000
Johnny...

376
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,860
Johnny, you're all right!

377
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,900
Oh, Julie...

378
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,000
I don't know.

379
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,220
I think so.

380
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,000
Where's Dr. Wyman?

381
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,920
What happened?

382
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,060
Suppose you tell us what happened?

383
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,200
Julie, what happened to Dr. Wyman?

384
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,260
He's dead.

385
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,600
Why are you staring at me?

386
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,899
You don't think that I had
anything to do with it?

387
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,980
John...

388
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,439
We're just as confused as you are.

389
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,720
Did you see anything?

390
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,359
Was there anybody in the room

391
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,800
with you and Dr. Wyman?

392
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,060
I don't know!

393
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,180
Last thing I remember,

394
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,540
I was making my descent.

395
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,099
The jets didn't take hold, when
I finally released the drag chute

396
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,420
it didn't hold.

397
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,160
I was too close to the ground.

398
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,500
You crashed.

399
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,160
We brought you here.

400
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,560
You don't remember?

401
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,440
I seemed to be floating,

402
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,080
in a warm,

403
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,460
black mist.

404
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,840
Oh, my head!

405
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,300
My neck!

406
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,420
Oh no...

407
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,040
Look at that.

408
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,580
The same mark.

409
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,060
What's this?

410
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,520
Tell me what's happening.

411
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,860
Johnny...

412
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,240
You don't understand.

413
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
We thought you were dead.

414
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,400
Dead?

415
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,980
What do you mean, dead?

416
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,259
When we pulled you
out of the compartment,

417
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,980
your body had completely
ceased to function.

418
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,200
A hypometabolistic state.

419
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,360
A type of suspended animation,

420
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,220
brought on by the contraction
of the mesentery blood vessels

421
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,460
in the pressure change of landing.

422
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,019
That kind of terminology,
I'd expect it from Dr. Wyman,

423
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,320
not from you.

424
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,380
Well it seemed like
the natural diagnosis.

425
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,200
From Dr. Wyman, yes.

426
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,060
In some way I think Dr. Wyman

427
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,960
is influencing me.

428
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,100
I think he may be a part of
me now.

429
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,160
I don't understand!

430
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,660
You've got to help me!

431
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,240
Help me!

432
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,919
It's fantastic, it's unbelievable,

433
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,320
things like this just don't happen.

434
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,080
But it has happened.

435
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,360
I'm not afraid.

436
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,120
I'm not afraid.

437
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,420
It didn't come here to destroy!

438
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,640
Johnny...

439
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,380
Try to tell us.

440
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,900
What didn't come here to
destroy us?

441
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,880
Is he all right?

442
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,080
Yes. They're gone.

443
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,100
What are you talking about?

444
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,020
Come see for yourself.

445
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,380
That's what your
blood looks like now,

446
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,600
normal in every respect.

447
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,399
Four hours ago it was
populated with alien,

448
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,300
amorphic cell structures.

449
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,680
I think we should see what I look
like under the fluoroscope.

450
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,800
How will it work with the
power out?

451
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,360
It operates on a radium
cathode tube.

452
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,040
What are they?

453
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,520
The amorphic cell structures
have expanded to...

454
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,480
They're using his body
for a breeding ground.

455
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,259
You're not gonna harm them,
are you?

456
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,600
What do you mean?

457
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,540
We don't even know what they are.

458
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,639
The one thing we do
know is that they're

459
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,200
alien to the human body.

460
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,319
Somehow they must have come down

461
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,720
with you in the compartment.

462
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,100
Only a few hours ago they
were microscopic.

463
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,719
We've got to do something.

464
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,340
If you destroy them,

465
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,240
you destroy me.

466
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,320
You can't destroy them.

467
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,220
But why not?

468
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,540
That's why not...

469
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,660
Steve! Don't shoot,
it won't hurt you!

470
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,980
Steve, don't shoot!

471
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,500
Don't shoot, it won't hurt you!

472
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,120
It's burned, but it got away,
didn't it?

473
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,340
It didn't go very far.
It's gone!

474
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,819
It was burnt pretty bad.

475
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,619
I think we outta track it down
and make sure it's dead.

476
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,759
No, let's wait for help,
we can't possibly

477
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,399
combat that thing by ourselves.

478
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,939
Look, nobody has
gotten to us and no one

479
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,640
probably will until it's destroyed.

480
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,440
Why does it have to be killed?

481
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,660
Why are we always so quick to destroy?

482
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,180
It's an alien, it's the first of
its kind of come to the Earth.

483
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,899
John you know what it's done
to you,

484
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,179
breeding its young in your body,

485
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,579
you saw what it did to Dr. Wyman,

486
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,820
isn't that reason enough?

487
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,340
It has to be killed!

488
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,840
You don't understand,
it didn't come in malice.

489
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,519
It could have killed
all of you earlier,

490
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
but it was me it was after.

491
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,740
It had to come back to me to...

492
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,200
To nourish its young.

493
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,080
All the more reason to
destroy it!

494
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,660
Suppose it is still alive?
Bullets don't harm it.

495
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,420
But fire seems to.

496
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,659
What about a very pistol?
It has an engulfing flame,

497
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,040
plus a delayed explosion.

498
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,640
That's better than a lantern.

499
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,059
Very pistol?

500
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,340
A flare gun, at short range
it'll chop down anything.

501
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,359
There's some in the cabinet
in the hall, I'll get 'em.

502
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,539
No! Dave, you can't!

503
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,079
Listen, you can't kill
a living creature

504
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,140
without giving it a
chance to justify itself!

505
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,900
Let's put him in there.

506
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,020
Can give him something
to keep him quiet?

507
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,080
Sodium amytal.

508
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,800
Good.

509
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,939
I'll leave you here to watch him.

510
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,299
Donna will come with us,

511
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,960
we're gonna need photographic coverage.

512
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,980
Will that really keep him
out until we get back?

513
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,500
I don't know.

514
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,359
Under normal circumstances,
this should render him

515
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,419
unconscious for at least
twelve hours.

516
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,040
But this isn't a normal person.

517
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,979
What you and he were to each other,

518
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,920
has no bearing on
what he is now, Julie.

519
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,780
I'm not worried.

520
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,440
He's not dangerous.

521
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,400
Not to me, anyway.

522
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,959
Well we can't take any chances.

523
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,040
If that creature eludes us
and comes back here,

524
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,560
or he gives you a bad time,

525
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,380
you'd better know how
to use a very pistol.

526
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,639
Believe me, Julie,

527
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,560
he's not the same man
you were engaged to.

528
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,220
Thanks. Let me have
one for Julie, will you?

529
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,560
Now don't worry.

530
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,140
If we run any trouble,

531
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,080
we're not gonna be heroes.

532
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,440
Just pull the hammer back.

533
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,280
Just be back as soon as you can.

534
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,920
If it got this far,
it's a lot healthier than I am.

535
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,000
You know, I think it's leading
us back to the compartment.

536
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,920
Yeah, it looks that way.

537
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,800
How long do you think we've
been out?

538
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,480
Well look,
my watch is running again!

539
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
Mine too.

540
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,880
That means that magnetic
field must be broken.

541
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,760
It must be dead.

542
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,480
We'd better make certain.

543
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,880
Well, it seems like the most
likely place for it to go.

544
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,080
Yeah, I don't see anything.

545
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,679
Maybe it's on the inside.

546
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,800
Yeah.

547
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,100
Donna, you stay here until
we're sure it's safe.

548
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,899
Dave, you circle to the left,

549
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,340
and I'll go to the right. Check.

550
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,320
Nothing could possibly
live through that!

551
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,620
Look, it stopped again!

552
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,140
Hey Steve!

553
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,399
I'd better get some pictures before

554
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,340
there's nothing left to shoot!

555
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,459
Hold it!

556
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,800
It's gonna kill her!
Fire over its head!

557
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,339
Are you hurt? No.

558
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,820
I don't think so.

559
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,800
It could have killed me.

560
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,859
But it didn't.

561
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,700
Probably would have
if we hadn't chased it off.

562
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,340
Might have wound up like Wyman.

563
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,899
We'd better get back.

564
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,059
Julie's all alone
and the monster may

565
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,679
try and contact Corcoran again.

566
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,080
Yeah, let's go.

567
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,240
Don't be afraid, Julie.

568
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,660
I'm not going to hurt you.

569
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,940
That wasn't meant for you.

570
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,280
That was for the creature
or whatever it is.

571
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,560
Don't stare at me, Julie.

572
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,680
I'm sorry, John.

573
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,240
If what you say is true
and I've been dead,

574
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,460
I don't know what
this means for us,

575
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,340
but I haven't changed in my feeling.

576
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,659
Julie, we're all afraid
of the unknown.

577
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,680
You don't understand what's
happened to me and

578
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,060
because there's an unknown being

579
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,379
you want to destroy it.

580
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,419
But isn't it possible
that what's taking place

581
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,940
is for a purpose?

582
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,259
Why not let the creature have
a chance

583
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,840
to tell us why it's here?

584
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,060
But it broke in and attacked us.

585
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,000
It killed Dr. Wyman and
it's done this to you.

586
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,759
We had to do something.

587
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,220
Now the others have gone
to make sure it's dead.

588
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,379
It's not dead.

589
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,920
And they won't be
able to find it.

590
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,120
How do you know?

591
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,340
Julie, I'm the one who's had
the most contact with it.

592
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,760
Something foreign is inside
of me.

593
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,260
Alive.

594
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,800
If there was any cause for fear,

595
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,980
wouldn't I know it?

596
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,960
But I'm not afraid.
This creature is intelligent.

597
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,639
It wants something.

598
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,080
We've got to give it a chance
to communicate with us.

599
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,020
I see the sedative didn't work.

600
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,760
My bodily reactions aren't
those of a normal person.

601
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,460
What happened to the creature?

602
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,420
Got away. Then it's alive!

603
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,980
He told me it would be.

604
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,640
Somehow he knew.

605
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,199
He seemed so sure that it's
not evil.

606
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,999
This isn't a battle between
men and an unreasoning being.

607
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,500
Can't you see it doesn't want
to kill for the sake of killing?

608
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,336
It could have done away with all
of us earlier if it wanted to.

609
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,499
Until we discovered its fear

610
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,260
of fire. Listen!

611
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,299
When you were out checking
the power lines last night,

612
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,419
all you had with you was a pistol,
which you fired at it

613
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,700
with no effect.

614
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,579
If it had been a wild animal
it would have tried to

615
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,280
kill you before moving on.

616
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,320
Can you account for what
happened to Dr. Wyman?

617
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,960
No, I can't.

618
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,419
But maybe it could if
we gave it the chance.

619
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,860
Why should we give it a chance?

620
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,239
It's already committed murder.

621
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,760
It's done I don't know what
to you and it's attacked Donna.

622
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,780
Look...

623
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,899
If you were in a strange place
and you were trying to

624
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,259
communicate with the inhabitants,
but every time you tried

625
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,840
they made a move against you,

626
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,740
the only way to break
through to them

627
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,220
would be to take a hostage.

628
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,159
Can't you see that's
what it's been doing?

629
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,219
It's been acting out of
fear and self preservation.

630
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,139
It wants to communicate with
us but it doesn't know how.

631
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,760
We've got to give it a chance.

632
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,360
Well what do you have in mind?

633
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,219
It's obvious the creature keeps
coming back to me because

634
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,520
part of it is inside of me.

635
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,800
Why not let me lead us to it?

636
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,820
In the daylight,

637
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,140
in the open.

638
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,780
Maybe he's got something.

639
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,779
When we were out searching
for the creature,

640
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,560
our watches started running again.

641
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,620
Then when we encountered it,

642
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,120
they stopped.

643
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,360
On our way back here
they became active again.

644
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,540
And now everything's dead.

645
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,639
Now it's my guess that the
magnetic disturbance

646
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,300
originated from two different locations.

647
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,300
One from the creature,

648
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,559
and then from you.

649
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,680
It might be the only thing
that's keeping you alive.

650
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,340
If my life has been given
back to me, it's for a purpose.

651
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,599
Trust me,

652
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,900
and we'll learn why.

653
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,819
If the creature isn't what
you believe it to be,

654
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,360
and we're forced to kill it,

655
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,380
then we have no indication
of what will happen to you.

656
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,220
I know.

657
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,519
That's why it's important
to let the creature

658
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,540
make itself known before
we take any action.

659
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,539
All right.

660
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,040
But if we follow Johnny's plan,

661
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,820
we still have to be prepared.

662
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,601
We have no way of knowing what
can happen to us out there.

663
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,900
Remember:

664
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,779
We've agreed to give the creature

665
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,460
every opportunity to prove itself.

666
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,399
In the morning, if we still
agree to follow Johnny's plan,

667
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,699
we'll get an early start.

668
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,580
By that time maybe help will arrive.

669
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,279
Dave and I will stand guard,

670
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,080
the rest of you get as
much sleep as you can.

671
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,960
Will it come back here tonight?

672
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,920
I don't know.

673
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,260
Steve...

674
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,280
I'm a little worried
about Johnny's plan.

675
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,200
So am I.

676
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,020
I don't know if he is
responsible for his actions.

677
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,480
Think it might be a trap?

678
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,200
If it is,

679
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,280
this time we're gonna be prepared.

680
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,780
Come on.

681
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,840
How about a Molotov cocktail?

682
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,759
We fill it with gasoline and
then use it as a hand grenade.

683
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,879
That's the ticket.

684
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,339
We could saturate the creature.

685
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,259
And detonate it with a very pistol.

686
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,240
There's no way it could
escape then.

687
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,640
How many bombs are we gonna make?

688
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,480
Oh, between us we ought to
be able to carry about six.

689
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,100
What are we gonna
do with the girls?

690
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,400
Take them with us.

691
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,340
Better than them here unprotected.

692
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,760
That's enough.

693
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,119
Are we gonna tell Julie
and Donna about this?

694
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,540
No, I think we better

695
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,240
make sure Johnny doesn't
find out, huh?

696
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,360
You ever see any of
these work before?

697
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,420
Yeah.

698
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,200
On Guadalcanal.

699
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,380
A guerrilla tank was running
wild behind our lines.

700
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,379
He knew we couldn't do him much
damage with our rifles, so

701
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,460
he was playing kind of a
cat and mouse game,

702
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,240
because he knew he
could finish us off.

703
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,300
Not far from where we were there
was a truck overturned, and the

704
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,440
kid in it saw what was happening.

705
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,920
He got the brilliant idea to
bring me some gasoline and

706
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,820
I made up some of these.

707
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,100
When that tank came by,
we smeared it, but good.

708
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,260
Pretty horrible to see.

709
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,100
But it works.

710
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,080
It'll be good for me to get
off of this mountain.

711
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,679
Even with these cocktails,
I'm not anxious to

712
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,059
tangle with that creature again.

713
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,420
Well none of us are, but
I don't think we have any choice.

714
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,100
Since it came down in the
satellite it's our responsibility.

715
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,640
Besides, it's...

716
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,620
Better to stalk it than
have it come after us.

717
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah, you're probably right.

718
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,519
Even so, I wish we could
wait for some help.

719
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,759
I just don't like the idea of
taking Julie and Donna with us.

720
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,000
Well, I don't either.

721
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,239
But then we don't know
when help will arrive,

722
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,800
we can't leave them alone.

723
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,760
What are you doing here?

724
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,820
What are you doing with
Dr. Wyman's body?

725
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,480
I couldn't sleep.

726
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,840
I had to see how he was killed.

727
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,760
Half his head gone, it's horrible.

728
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,760
I don't expect you to trust me.

729
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,360
I don't even know whether
I can trust myself, but

730
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,219
please don't treat me like a monster,

731
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,639
I haven't done anything wrong.

732
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,640
John, it's not a question
of right or wrong.

733
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,100
Maybe you're not responsible
for your actions.

734
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,159
Whether you are or not,

735
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,580
who knows what you might do?

736
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,340
Look John, don't you...

737
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,739
Don't you realize this
unknown creature

738
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,820
is using your body as
a breeding ground?

739
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,680
We don't know what to expect.

740
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,140
I can't deny anything you've said.

741
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,320
I do receive impulses
from the creature, but

742
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,900
I know I have free will, I...

743
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,700
I know I can still make
my own decisions.

744
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,060
Was it your own free will
or the creature's

745
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,540
that insists it's benevolent?

746
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,760
I'm not sure.

747
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,460
But I do know that we have to
give it a chance to explain,

748
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,480
and I know that no
harm will come to you.

749
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,539
Daylight will be here
in about three hours.

750
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,040
You'd better get some rest.

751
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,360
If it's all the same to you, I'll

752
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,880
stay here for a while.

753
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,600
I'll get the bags.

754
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,959
Alright.

755
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,840
You will give it a chance to explain?

756
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,200
We'll give it a chance.

757
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,300
The creature isn't far away.

758
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,180
There's some hills to the north.

759
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,840
And a cave.

760
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,979
But he's never been
in this area before.

761
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,020
How does he know there's a cave?

762
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,200
It's in there.

763
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,440
Julie, Donna!

764
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,280
Stay there!
There's nothing to fear.

765
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,940
We're not gonna take any
unnecessary chances.

766
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,880
The girls will wait here.
Okay, you lead the way.

767
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,820
You're gonna give it a chance.

768
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,060
You're not gonna kill it?

769
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,820
You're not gonna kill it!

770
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,020
What happened?

771
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,700
Why did you let him go?
I couldn't stop him!

772
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,960
I brought them to you.

773
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,740
They don't understand.

774
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,639
I'm not sure I do.

775
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,280
How can I help you to
communicate with us?

776
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,819
Now I am able to speak

777
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,479
by assimilation,

778
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,820
a form of photosynthesis.

779
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,019
I have been able to
incorporate certain of

780
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,600
Dr. Wyman's functional processes.

781
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,960
Was Dr. Wyman's death necessary?

782
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,199
Through his sacrifice,

783
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,939
I can communicate,

784
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,859
understand your reasoning,

785
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,200
your motivations, your way of life.

786
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,560
I will need your help.

787
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,899
Together we must make them understand

788
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,480
that I have not harmed you,

789
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
that we will give them a
better way of life.

790
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,060
Look!

791
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,620
Listen!

792
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,100
Please listen!

793
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,919
Do not be afraid,

794
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,980
I am not here to harm you.

795
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,120
We're too far away!

796
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,420
Let's move in.

797
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,180
Do not be afraid.

798
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,139
That's Dr. Wyman's voice!
It is this voice.

799
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,459
But how?

800
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,200
Yes, I am using Dr. Wyman's voice.

801
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,719
I've been able to master
the use of many

802
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,400
of his faculties.

803
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,620
With his voice I am able
to communicate with you.

804
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,120
You killed him!

805
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,920
He is not dead.

806
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,360
Not dead?

807
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,680
He has gained something more
than life as you know it.

808
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,419
He is the first of your
kind to attain immortality.

809
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,720
Immortality?

810
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,940
We're not interested in
that kind of immortality.

811
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,440
I know you want to destroy me.

812
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,220
But listen, please listen.

813
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,619
I only want to help you.

814
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,819
Millions of years ago,
my people inhabited

815
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,540
a planet such as yours.

816
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,160
We discovered the ultimate power,

817
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,900
just as you on Earth
are about to do.

818
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,020
Be ready to make your move.

819
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,439
We should have put this
power for our own benefit.

820
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,059
Instead, hatred, greed

821
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,100
and prejudice caused us
to misuse that power,

822
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,319
and brought about our own destruction.

823
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,080
Open target! Now's our chance...

824
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,659
But you can't risk killing Johnny.

825
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,039
No, wait! What harm is there

826
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,519
in hearing them out?

827
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,299
For centuries we have
been circling your Earth,

828
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,080
waiting for a means to
penetrate your atmosphere.

829
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,900
Your projectile was the first
to present a means of entry.

830
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,579
Those before were not retractable,

831
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,719
and burned as they fell back
to Earth.

832
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,539
I am the first to come.

833
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,739
To bring death and destruction?

834
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,239
If what you say is true,

835
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,319
what are we to expect?

836
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,659
You need me.

837
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,980
And I have to come.

838
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,900
Through me we will unite our
intellects within one body.

839
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,359
It's insane.

840
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,840
And how do you plan to do that?

841
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,160
Already, it has begun.

842
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,740
Within the hour, the first of
our new generation will be born.

843
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,480
It's true.

844
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,500
I can feel them inside.

845
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,780
You're imposing your will on us!

846
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,060
You're sacrificing our
civilization for the

847
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,800
resurrection of your own.

848
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,880
I've been a fool!

849
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,519
The only way you can be saved
from your downfall is

850
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,919
by our sacrifice.

851
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,619
What you propose is dominance,

852
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,760
not salvation!

853
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,920
Don't be governed by fear!

854
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,480
Go ahead and kill me!

855
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,180
You've already said I'm dead.

856
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,720
A dead man with a brain and
a body kept alive artificially

857
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,140
to feed a generation of monsters.

858
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,000
That's not true!

859
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,640
If you don't kill me,

860
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,720
a new civilization is inside
of me,

861
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,840
that will destroy mankind
as we know it today.

862
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,040
The future of our race is in you.

863
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,500
You've got to kill me.

864
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,260
We have to destroy it.

865
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,100
John!

866
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,400
Run, get away from it!

867
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,799
He will live on to
become a greater being

868
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,000
in future generations to come.

869
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,940
Don't kill me!

870
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,019
In destroying me,
you are destroying your

871
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,020
only hope for mankind.

872
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,880
You've got to kill me!

873
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,920
You are not ready!

874
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,240
But we will still save you!

875
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,180
In your quest for self destruction
you will send up more satellites,

876
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,240
and we will be there,

877
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,280
waiting to come again!

878
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,640
There's nothing left.

879
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,040
Do you think we made the
right decision?

880
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,600
John made the decision.

881
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,880
Let's hope it was the right one.

882
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,780
We'll probably never know.
