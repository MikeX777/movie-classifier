1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:10,385
{y:i}As far back as I can remember,
{y:i}it has been raining.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:18,768
{y:i}Legends tell of vast continents and
{y:i}great cities before the catastrophe.

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,731
{y:i}But it's all just faded glory of the past.

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,904
{y:i}Our ancestors foresaw the catastrophe,
{y:i}escaped to Sisil Island in the Pacific...

5
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:35,076
{y:i}...and built another Noah's Arc,
{y:i}a self-growing city...

6
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,499
{y:i}...that feeds of pollution, called ECOBAN.

7
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,048
{y:i}Refugee ships flooded in by the thousands.

8
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,010
{y:i}But ECOBAN didn't allow...

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:58,016
{y:i}...the contaminated refugees into the city.

10
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,835
The workers' safety is at risk down there.

11
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,545
I request you stop work at once.

12
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,132
Who cares? They're just animals
to be worked, not coddled!

13
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,117
God damn it.

14
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,327
They're not even worth the food they eat!

15
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,309
This is a waste of time.

16
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,519
We should burn it all to hell!

17
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,357
Sir! Please, help us, quick!

18
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,442
They're all going to be killed!

19
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,487
You're ruining the equipment!

20
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,905
Disconnect the deck!

21
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,491
What? No!

22
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,077
People are still down there!

23
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,959
Don't remember asking for your opinion.

24
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,836
Flip the switch!

25
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,421
Over my dead body!

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,423
Your dead body, eh?

27
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,510
Jay, give him what he wants.

28
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,888
- That's not my job, sir.
- What?

29
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,775
Disconnect, hurry!

30
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,054
Your first duty is to obey my orders!

31
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,432
Return to ECOBAN immediately!

32
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:51,429
Director: Kim, Moon-syang.

33
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,771
What is the Adjutant thinking?

34
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,567
Is he trying to provoke riots?

35
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,698
Or is he really trying to slaughter the Marrians?

36
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,451
He's just doing what he can to increase...

37
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,121
...pollution for our DELOS system.

38
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,625
But, it is true his methods are dangerous.

39
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,170
I'll ask the Governor to intercede.

40
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,839
It won't do any good.

41
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,427
To them, Marrians are little more then insects.

42
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,763
You've gone so soft, Jay!

43
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,933
ECOBAN is in a crisis situation.

44
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,938
You know that mercy is forbidden...

45
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,983
...so as to preserve our pure ECOBAN.

46
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,821
Just relax! Let's go down and
enjoy the centennial celebration.

47
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,606
Still brooding over that?

48
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm just tired.

49
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,739
Then I'll transfer you to domestic patrol.

50
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,950
Nothing is hard here on the inside.

51
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,107
What is it?

52
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,942
Intruder alert in the Control Center!

53
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,028
- What?
- The security sensor was triggered.

54
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,947
Send a patrol to the Center.

55
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,782
I'm on my way.

56
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,374
Patrol 1 to the DELOS Center!

57
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,494
There you are!

58
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,496
The plate has been hacked, sir.

59
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,915
- No other plate?
- No, sir.

60
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,250
He'll run for the side.

61
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,586
Turn the fans on in Area 3!

62
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,840
Yes, that's right.

63
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,969
Alpha to 330, Bravo to 348!

64
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,846
Charlie to 353!

65
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,705
There!

66
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:36,214
Target sighted in Zone 3. Alpha, move to 33!

67
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,670
We lost his trail, sir.

68
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,880
Nothing here either, sir.

69
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,189
Control room, stop fan 31!

70
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,944
Dr. Noah's work!

71
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,118
Control, it's Jay.
Show me the Time-Capsule Room.

72
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,211
What, now this rat's got wings?

73
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,512
Jay, report your position.

74
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,598
I'm in the Time-Capsule Room.
I think he's here.

75
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,941
Jay, acknowledge!

76
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,657
Jay, are you okay?

77
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,034
Yes.

78
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,911
What happened?

79
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,955
Sorry, I almost got him.

80
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,333
How could he have got this far?

81
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,963
We assumed our security impenetrable.

82
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,758
But today the DELOS Center,
of all places, was infiltrated...

83
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:15,720
...and the man responsible escaped unscathed.

84
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,100
He knew the DELOS system
like the back of his hand.

85
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,771
A few more minutes, and he'd
have connected to the mainframe,...

86
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,857
...allowing him to cause
a DELOS energy release.

87
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,902
A DELOS energy release?

88
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,487
That's correct.

89
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,657
Like the breach 10 years ago.

90
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:41,496
You mean he's alive? Dr. Noah?

91
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,998
There's no reason to doubt otherwise.

92
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,545
The Marrian idiots could
never puzzle out the system,...

93
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,839
...even if we gave them the blueprints.

94
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,551
Dr. Noah knows of our situation.

95
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,013
DELOS energy levels are running so low...

96
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:02,434
...that ECOBAN has stopped its growth.

97
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,022
If we leave him alive,...

98
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,107
...he'll just keep destroying our system.

99
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,861
We can no longer afford to
postpone on a decision.

100
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,366
We must torch the oil fields...

101
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,036
...and enlarge the polluted area.

102
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,583
That alone would give us enough
energy for another 50 years.

103
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,129
We decided on this matter 10 years ago.

104
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,342
There is no reason to hold back our
plans for Operation Marr any longer.

105
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:41,139
Torch the whole field to catch a few rats?

106
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,267
One rat made it in, but he failed.

107
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,436
Our security is reliable.

108
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,314
They may be no more than animals,...

109
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,816
...but animals we need for work.

110
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,736
Too much oppression will prompt a revolt.

111
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,655
More pollution for energy!

112
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,492
That is our ultimate priority.

113
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,495
Yes, to get more energy,...

114
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,290
...we must expand the polluted area...

115
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,418
...but if we kill the Marrians
then who'll do the work?

116
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,879
And though it's unlikely,...

117
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,131
...what if they were to revolt?

118
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:19,803
The Marrians outnumber ECOBAN 10 to 1.

119
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,516
You're as weak and
undependable as your security.

120
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,477
With the pollution increased,...

121
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,646
...we won't need oil fields or workers...

122
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:35,860
First, reinforce security
in Marr and ECOBAN.

123
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,697
Then search for the intruder
and find out his background.

124
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,866
The matter is important to us.

125
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,044
Adjutant.

126
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,548
Prepare for the operation. Just in case.

127
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,731
You can't do a simple thing
without stirring up trouble?

128
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:16,526
Then go do it yourself, old man.

129
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,654
By setting off the alarm today,...

130
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,573
...you doubled the security by now!

131
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,367
Now it's impossible to get in...

132
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,244
...and stop the DELOS system.

133
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,455
Just hand me the data!

134
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,209
So, let's see...

135
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,005
...what's new in that ol' mountain of a city?

136
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:48,058
The DELOS systems running low on fuel, I see.

137
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,727
The pollution is disappearing.

138
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,356
The system's on the verge of dying.

139
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,569
If DELOS system stops,
what happens to ECOBAN?

140
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,155
We'll see a blue sky.

141
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,950
Not the sky, I mean ECOBAN.

142
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,080
Well, they won't like it,...

143
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,458
...but they'll have to use solar
energy like in the 21 century.

144
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,252
ECOBAN will be a huge crap.

145
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,297
Then they'll have to work out in the sun,...

146
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,508
...shoulder to shoulder with the Marrians.

147
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,134
Shoulder to shoulder?

148
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,306
They'd kill us first.

149
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,100
Where the hell's Woody?

150
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,521
Oh yeah, I met her there.

151
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,356
Who?

152
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,608
An old friend.

153
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,862
Old friends are for living people.

154
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,989
You're a dead man! Forget about it!

155
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,451
Just think on how to get in again...

156
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,621
...to shut down the DELOS system.

157
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,457
And forget about your glider...

158
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,835
...way too dangerous.

159
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,299
Let him pass.

160
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,060
Pass it along!

161
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,524
Cut the funeral music!

162
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,192
How 'bout some party tunes!

163
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,912
Woody, wanna drag?

164
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,914
It's precious.

165
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,131
Too hot!

166
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,031
Shua!

167
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,576
What's the occasion?

168
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,706
Woody, let's go.

169
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,251
Shua!

170
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,553
I don't like him, that ECOBAN outcast!

171
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:34,140
If not for Woody, I'd smash his head in.

172
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,146
Moe, you seen my propeller?

173
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,440
This?

174
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,944
Are you kidding? Nah, the small one.

175
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,447
You said you needed this?

176
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:56,079
First you hang around with them
and now you steal things?

177
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,417
I didn't steal it. I found it.

178
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,545
You said you needed it for the glider.

179
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,757
Don't hang around with them.

180
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,385
It's too dangerous, got it?

181
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,559
Give me the harmonica.

182
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,981
Shua!

183
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,026
That's cool. What is it?

184
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,902
A bracelet.

185
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,904
Where did you get it?

186
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,823
None of your business, boy.

187
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,992
Who is it?

188
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,891
Dr. Noah says the sky is blue.

189
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,852
That people used to say "sky blue".

190
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,357
And in Gibraltar, the sky and...

191
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,485
...ocean are blue. Imagine!

192
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,874
Come with me.

193
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,334
Where?

194
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,351
It's off limits here.

195
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,603
Let's go back.

196
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,105
I'm scared.

197
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,024
Don't worry!

198
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:51,027
Just close your eyes and hold my hand.

199
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,655
I'll show you something wonderful.

200
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,254
Go ahead, open your eyes.

201
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:17,053
This is wonderful!

202
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,266
But how'd you know about this?

203
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,560
Dr. Noah told me!

204
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,564
He said in Gibraltar,
you can see this every day.

205
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,484
Jay, promise we'll go there together.

206
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,170
{y:i}It was so beautiful it blinded your eyes.

207
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:53,506
{y:i}We called it our Wonderful Day.

208
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,135
{y:i}But it didn't last long.

209
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,138
{y:i}That night it disappeared behind the clouds.

210
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,807
{y:i}And I never saw him after that day.

211
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:10,023
Who's land is this?

212
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:15,320
Who cultivated the land and built the town?

213
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:20,825
Whose blood and sweat made our Marr?

214
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,870
Was it Ecoban's? No!

215
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,330
It was ours!

216
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,374
Hey, it's getting rough!

217
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,334
There's going to be riot.

218
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:33,088
Nuh-uh. Shua would have known,...

219
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,465
...but my brother didn't say anything.

220
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,176
He's from ECOBAN,...

221
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,805
...he can't be your brother?

222
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,265
He's just some crazy mofo!

223
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,184
He is too my brother! Wh-why's he crazy?

224
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,479
Always rambling on about Gibraltar.

225
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,022
No such thing in the world.

226
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,150
You have to live here.

227
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,695
And I'll teach you to be a fighter.

228
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,532
Woody! Where you...?

229
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,580
- Woody!
- Hurry up!

230
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,590
Now they're rioting in the morning.

231
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,343
Guess that means no business today.

232
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,554
Did you see Woody by any chance?

233
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:27,017
Woody? Yeah, I thought
I saw him with that dwarf.

234
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,436
What is his name?

235
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,564
Bring me that will you?

236
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,528
One's coming! Get it at the crossroad!

237
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,444
Woody, you crazy?

238
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,488
What the hell are you doing?

239
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,656
- Are you crazy?
- W-Wait a sec.

240
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,950
What in the world...

241
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,870
Hey! Hey!

242
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:54,479
If you see Woody, tell him to go home.

243
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,449
Jay, there're riots in the plaza.
Let's turn back.

244
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,494
Fuck you!

245
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,306
Jay! Are you okay?

246
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,392
Answer me!

247
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,440
Shua?

248
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:27,692
You're Shua, aren't you?

249
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:33,656
Listen. Outside ECOBAN is dangerous!

250
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,994
I thought you were dead.

251
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:44,042
The Shua you know is dead.

252
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,463
You and I are enemies.

253
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,009
I don't think Marrians are my enemy.

254
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:56,012
Too bad the Marrians don't see it that way.

255
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,600
Damn it!

256
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,854
Those pains in the ass!

257
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,898
Hide in there.

258
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,946
Stairs should be wide and convenient!

259
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,657
This is slope climbing!

260
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,035
Oh hey, Shua! There you are.

261
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,248
The boss wants you.

262
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:27,961
Let's plan out our strategy
for the big mission tomorrow.

263
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,175
This job's hot!
We're gonna hit ECOBAN's post.

264
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:46,479
I'm so glad you're alive, Shua!

265
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,275
You don't know...

266
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,237
...but I've missed you as much as you miss...

267
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:57,073
...that blue sky of yours.

268
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:18,553
Go back, Jay. Don't come back.

269
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,133
Kill me now, Helen.

270
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:00,470
I'm about to explode.

271
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,305
Get real!

272
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,182
She's twice your size!

273
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,559
- Don't make me kick your ass!
- What the...?

274
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,979
Shut the hell up and listen!

275
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:14,818
The ECOBANs are bringing in
shipments by trucks every day.

276
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,612
They're some presents
meant for us, I'm sure.

277
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,281
I just want Helen, that's all.

278
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,536
We should accept these gifts.

279
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,455
And show them our gratitude.

280
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,165
What're you talking about?

281
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,544
Tomorrow, we'll hit the Ecoban post,...

282
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:35,547
...take our presents...

283
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,133
...and give them our thanks.

284
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,592
So?

285
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,888
What kind of friends would we be not...

286
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,182
...to invite you along
for something as big as this?

287
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,810
Friends?

288
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,522
Friends of resistance!

289
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:56,526
You're using resistance to justify...

290
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,778
...what's little more then theft?

291
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,741
Keep low if you know what's good for you.

292
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,077
Son of a--!

293
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,791
If you could stop thinking
with your muscles...

294
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,044
...you'd know what really needs doing.

295
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,172
Acting stupid and getting yourself
killed is your business.

296
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,674
But don't drag Woody into it!

297
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:23,219
If anything happens to him,
I'll be sending you home in pieces!

298
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,935
Hey! Who saved Woody today?

299
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:33,021
You ungrateful little twat!

300
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm telling you, he's an ECOBAN at heart!

301
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,317
Self-righteous prick!

302
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,569
C'mon, hit the music!

303
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,038
You want to live with them?

304
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:54,125
Why? Are you m-mad at me?

305
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,212
Yes. You ignored my warnings.

306
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,799
So you're leaving me behind?

307
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,510
I'll follow you.

308
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,470
Who's going where?

309
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:09,766
I know you'll fix the glider and...

310
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,978
...leave me behind. Then I'll kill myself!

311
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,149
Stop it!

312
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,945
What kind of shit are they
cramming into that head of yours.

313
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:24,489
And don't joke about dying.

314
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,157
Here.

315
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,952
Take it.

316
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,162
I don't need it.

317
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,290
But, it's from your girlfriend.

318
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,292
She's not.

319
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:40,005
And I'm not going anywhere.

320
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,008
Really? You're staying with me?

321
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:46,177
Shua, don't leave me behind no matter what.

322
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:47,929
I'll think about it.

323
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:55,478
You're sure Jay did that?

324
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,732
Yes, sir. Positive.

325
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,984
All right, that's be all.

326
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,074
Etha, let's keep this between us for now.

327
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,201
Yes, sir.

328
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,812
Our target is the suspect
who infiltrated the DELOS system.

329
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:22,273
He's hiding in a wrecked tanker
in Bay area no. 5.

330
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:26,569
If he resists... then shoot to kill.

331
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:34,137
Alpha 1, no one here!

332
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,639
Alpha 2, not a thing!

333
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,261
Why didn't you tell me?

334
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,734
He committed murder and ran from ECOBAN!

335
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:33,154
Don't let memories weaken
you into sympathy!

336
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,593
There! That's it.

337
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:58,221
Where?

338
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:03,226
Ah, I see it!

339
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:17,907
Afternoon, officer. Sorry I'm late.

340
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:20,118
Who the hell are you?

341
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:22,162
Show me your pass.

342
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:26,249
Oh, the pass? I must've dropped it.

343
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:30,003
No pass?

344
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:31,838
Out of the truck.

345
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:36,259
Oh, yes, that is... Where'd I put it?

346
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,970
What are you doing? Get out!

347
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:41,056
Right! The pass.

348
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,937
I'm out! Whatcha gonna do about it?

349
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:02,577
Son of a bitch!

350
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:08,500
Get on!

351
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,940
Hurry!

352
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,780
Wait! Stop your pursuit!

353
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:45,578
Let's party!

354
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,261
I'm told there was a robbery.

355
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,097
And what were you doing?

356
00:46:04,222 --> 00:46:07,642
While these vermin broke in and stole things?

357
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:12,355
How could I protect something that...

358
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:14,190
...I had no knowledge even existed?

359
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:16,818
You are full of excuses and no results.

360
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:19,946
If I trusted you, I wouldn't be here.

361
00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:23,158
The target changed course towards Bay Area 2.

362
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:24,993
As soon as the destination is confirmed,...

363
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:28,413
...I want you to clean out the whole place.

364
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:36,921
What's with the ruckus?

365
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,673
I thought I told those Hot Dogs to keep quiet.

366
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,217
Perhaps they scored big today.

367
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:45,263
You're not thinking about the glider, are you?

368
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:48,224
I'm just fixing it, that's all.

369
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:53,146
Flying that into ECOBAN
is asking to get killed.

370
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:56,024
Don't worry. I like living.

371
00:46:56,608 --> 00:47:00,445
ECOBAN is up to something.

372
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:01,863
They keep trucking something into Marr.

373
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:04,282
They're probably trying to torch all of Marr.

374
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:06,368
The DELOS system needs resources,...

375
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:10,205
...so they'll burn and pollute the whole area.

376
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:14,125
You're sure you're not
planning anything stupid?

377
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:17,629
Are you saying there's another way?

378
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:19,881
We need someone who can get to...

379
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:22,133
...the DELOS center without raising suspicion.

380
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,302
You want to use Jay?

381
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:28,807
Might as well wait until they
torch Marr to the ground.

382
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:31,059
Then forget about it!

383
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:11,141
There're more where it came from.

384
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:14,519
So you got something this time.

385
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,563
Wow, what is it?

386
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,905
What the hell is it?

387
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,827
What's this blinking?

388
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,829
You idiots!

389
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,214
- Freeze!
- Throw down your weapons!

390
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:45,842
- On the floor!
- Hands on the back!

391
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:26,091
Move.

392
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:33,348
Get away!

393
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:40,063
Don't make a sound!

394
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:43,233
No matter what, don't come out!

395
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,598
Perfect time to run out of ammo!

396
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:18,059
I'll cross first.

397
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:19,769
Watch and learn!

398
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:21,980
Check this out!

399
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,777
Moe!

400
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,155
Easier said than done!

401
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,116
Sons of bitches! Moe, I'm coming!

402
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:52,677
Zed!

403
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:55,972
Zed!

404
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,733
W-Woody, it's freezing.

405
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,572
I'll go and get Shua.

406
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:15,992
Don't leave me. I'm scared.

407
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,827
Don't be scared.

408
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:22,207
- I'm cold.
- I'll be back soon.

409
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,335
Don't leave me.

410
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,879
Don't worry. I'll come back.

411
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:30,090
And don't sing, okay?

412
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:53,196
Hush!

413
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,616
Hands on the wall!

414
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:58,284
One step back!

415
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,371
Take them out, and comb the building!

416
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:03,039
Yes, sir.

417
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,794
Where's Karen?

418
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:11,524
Woody?

419
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:13,026
Oh my...

420
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:15,528
Let's go out.

421
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:20,200
I can't.

422
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,496
Woody told me to wait.

423
00:54:59,257 --> 00:55:01,259
Why won't you die...

424
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,055
...you little cockroach!

425
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:07,766
Get up! I'll finish you off this time!

426
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:11,728
You should be thanking me
for taking the fall for you.

427
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:14,397
You should have died then...

428
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:16,983
...for the sake of ECOBAN!

429
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:20,862
You mean, so Jay won't know the truth.

430
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,573
That's right! Good for you.

431
00:55:23,698 --> 00:55:27,285
Now you'll have to die again
for Jay's sake, and mine!

432
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,383
Shua...

433
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:52,310
Woody!

434
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,481
Woody!

435
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:07,117
Move! Get out of the way!

436
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:27,238
I thought it was me looking after him,...

437
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:33,453
...but it was the other way around.

438
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,877
I wanted to show him the blue sky.

439
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:51,846
I'm Sorry, Zed.

440
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:58,436
I'm going to ECOBAN.

441
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,897
You don't have to come if you don't want to.

442
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:08,905
Thank you everyone.

443
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:13,159
First, we need Noah's help.

444
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:18,748
The Hot Dogs are now crushed,...

445
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:23,128
...but, Dr. Noah and his agent remain at large.

446
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:28,633
They're conspiring to bring
about ECOBAN's downfall.

447
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,344
Let's not blame security...

448
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,930
...and waste any more time.

449
00:58:35,306 --> 00:58:38,184
Operation Marr is ready.

450
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,564
With your approval, it can proceed immediately.

451
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,984
Expediency would be prudent.

452
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:48,778
We can no longer coexist with the Marrians.

453
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,115
And if energy levels fall any further,...

454
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:54,659
...many ECOBAN systems will malfunction.

455
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:58,538
Making it much harder to
suppress the Marrian riots.

456
00:58:58,955 --> 00:59:03,335
Moreover, Dr. Noah and his agent are
probably already preparing something.

457
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:06,796
We must eliminate the root of the problem.

458
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:26,316
It's our duty to protect ECOBAN.

459
00:59:26,816 --> 00:59:30,320
The only thing endangering
ECOBAN is ECOBAN itself.

460
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:35,033
I don't care anymore.

461
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,286
By tomorrow all of Marr will be gone,...

462
00:59:38,536 --> 00:59:41,247
...including Shua.

463
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,295
Even they have a right to protect themselves.

464
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,091
Where are you going?

465
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:52,967
Jay!

466
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:54,928
Jay!

467
00:59:55,553 --> 00:59:57,806
As long as we don't give up,...

468
00:59:58,264 --> 01:00:00,475
...he won't give up either.

469
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,086
{y:i}I'm sick of this bleak desolate future.

470
01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:18,882
{y:i}I just want a sky filled with light.

471
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:23,386
{y:i}Like that day so long ago.

472
01:03:24,512 --> 01:03:26,556
{y:i}Which is why I have to go.

473
01:03:26,973 --> 01:03:30,310
{y:i}I don't know where I'll be.

474
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:34,230
{y:i}But know you're with me in my heart.

475
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:38,276
{y:i}Take care of Woody.

476
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:31,705
All troops are assembled!

477
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:34,582
All troops are to enforce internal security.

478
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:37,168
Man your posts, stay alert, and report...

479
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:38,461
...any suspicious activity immediately!

480
01:04:38,586 --> 01:04:41,965
Who diverted the troops from Operation Marr?

481
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:45,010
Commander Cade, sir.

482
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:47,512
I was ordered to reinforce security.

483
01:04:47,595 --> 01:04:49,389
Where is he?

484
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:51,933
He went to the DELOS Tower, sir.

485
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,685
What?

486
01:04:53,768 --> 01:04:57,230
Send the troops to Marr. That's an order!

487
01:04:57,355 --> 01:04:58,898
Yes, sir.

488
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:00,900
Battalion, on the truck!

489
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:21,921
This war won't end until
we shut down the DELOS system.

490
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:25,675
You must disconnect the power supply...

491
01:05:26,092 --> 01:05:29,346
...before Shua puts the spics in the system.

492
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:31,639
That's your job.

493
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:58,667
There! See it?

494
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:02,170
Ready!

495
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,130
Fire!

496
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:29,030
Governor, Operation Marr is now underway.

497
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:31,074
I wish you luck.

498
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:33,493
I'll do my best, sir.

499
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,416
That way!

500
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:49,337
Hey, hey, aren't we going too fast?

501
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,881
All the sooner that we get to pay them back!

502
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:13,903
What's the? What happened?

503
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:16,197
There's a gap! Shit!

504
01:09:16,614 --> 01:09:18,616
That old man...

505
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:20,869
Hey! Stop!

506
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:23,246
He said go full speed!

507
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:18,343
Damn! I must be invincible
to have survived that!

508
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:22,639
I must have a guardian angel
and the devil's own luck!

509
01:10:23,682 --> 01:10:25,809
Shua! Want a lift?

510
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:04,514
Hurry!

511
01:12:58,378 --> 01:13:02,382
You guys are screwed once I cut the power!

512
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:46,653
So you finally made it.

513
01:14:53,743 --> 01:14:56,204
You deserve what you'll get.

514
01:14:56,871 --> 01:15:01,251
This is for the good of both Marr and ECOBAN.

515
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:02,794
ECOBAN?

516
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:05,922
You're ruining everyone's future!

517
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,800
You're ruining my future with Jay!

518
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:13,346
Why you? Why should only you have her?

519
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:30,697
No!

520
01:15:34,117 --> 01:15:35,618
Jay, no!

521
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:42,292
Don't make me do this to you.

522
01:15:46,629 --> 01:15:48,423
Jay!

523
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:02,797
Grandpa, I see something bright!

524
01:22:03,548 --> 01:22:07,177
That's right. That's right.
