1
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,541
Bye.

2
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,083
Bye, Mom.

3
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:36,666
I know it's frustrating.
But it's not easy at your age.

4
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,500
LAUNDRY WORKER
POSTMAN

5
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:35,500
-A subsidiary?
-Yes, in Toronto.

6
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,791
How long for?

7
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,916
Well, as long as it takes.
But a year at least.

8
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,041
A year at least?

9
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,333
You're going to live on the other side
of the world for a year at least?

10
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,875
I can image that…

11
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,541
You just casually drop that in
here on Boudewijn de Haas' couch

12
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,666
-a week and a half before you leave.
-I understand that…

13
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,041
Jesus! You can't just drop everything.
You've got two kids.

14
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,666
And you've got
all the time in the world. It's ideal.

15
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,250
Well… I… I think…

16
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,083
Let's try and…

17
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,125
They need to learn to fend for themselves,
Doris. It'll be good for them.

18
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,416
Otherwise they'll wind up
aged 45 with no job,

19
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
no money, no husband. Nothing.

20
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,166
-Hi.
-I'm not doing too great.

21
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,791
-Or rather with us.
-What happened?

22
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,958
Let's just says it was
some senseless violence.

23
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:09,750
Would you like to come in?
I was about to go to the market.

24
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,083
In that case, I'll come with you.

25
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,125
And I'll pop in
to the bicycle repair shop.

26
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,708
-One year?
-Yeah.

27
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,500
But he's got a business here:

28
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:34,125
The business
of looking after his son and daughter.

29
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:39,625
-It's a pretty big deal.
-But the worst thing about it is…

30
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,125
he's actually right.

31
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,416
I'm 45 and I'm a tragic case.

32
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:54,916
No job, no husband,
no money, no plan.

33
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,416
I'm a mess, aren't I?

34
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,583
I'm just like Sien's pet mouse.

35
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,208
I'm just running in circles.

36
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,500
Pointless little circles
and I'm getting nowhere.

37
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:11,750
Everyone I know has a purpose,
or they're actively doing something.

38
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,458
Sarah has a stream of interesting cases,

39
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:21,416
you've got a flashy career in TV,
Walter is moving to Canada,

40
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,500
and I'm the only one whose life
has come to a complete standstill,

41
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,083
who sits on the couch every night
like some sort of Big Lebowski

42
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:34,708
-watching Bake Off.
-Three million people watch that.

43
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,833
All you see on Instagram is photos
of all these super successful people

44
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,708
making something of themselves

45
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:44,833
with their witty hashtags
and their friends and their cleavages.

46
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,458
And it makes me wonder,
where did I go wrong?

47
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,958
Which turning did I miss?

48
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,958
I mean, this is nothing like

49
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,875
how I had imagined it would be.

50
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,083
-I feel…
-Take it easy, Doris.

51
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,833
I think you're hyperventilating.

52
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,625
Sorry.

53
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,708
Sorry.

54
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,500
You know, Door,
we're all walking in circles.

55
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,458
The people going for a run,
or taking their Rottweiler for a walk,

56
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,916
they're also walking in circles.

57
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,166
They walk to the bridge,
walk along the water and walk back home.

58
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,833
The stupid thing is the older I get,
the less I understand it.

59
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,791
-What?
-Everything. Life.

60
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,916
-Well, how had you pictured it then?
-What?

61
00:10:55,916 --> 00:11:00,500
Your life. When you were younger
and you pictured the future.

62
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:07,333
-I'm not going to tell you.
-Oh, go on.

63
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,833
I always wanted to study in England.

64
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:18,250
In one of those beautiful old university
buildings like Oxford or Cambridge.

65
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:24,333
And it would have
a bright green lawn in the middle.

66
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:29,833
And there I'd meet a handsome,
well-dressed literature professor,

67
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,750
-of course.
-Can I have two of those, please?

68
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:38,000
And together we'd drink too much tea
and have highly intelligent conversations.

69
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,791
Sounds like you've been watching
too many BBC dramas.

70
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,916
-Wrapped together or separately?
-Separately.

71
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:51,291
-Do Sien and Willem know?
-About our financial situation?

72
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,125
No, about Walter.

73
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,500
He's telling them tonight.

74
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

75
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,750
Here you go.

76
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,750
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

77
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,250
-Don't you like daffodils?
-Oh, yes, very much. Thank you.

78
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,916
Sorry. Oh shit, I have to take this.

79
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,708
Hi, Lynn, sorry I didn't call you back.

80
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,541
Yes, OK, that's fine.
Email it to me and I'll give it a read.

81
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:27,416
OK. See you later, yeah? OK. Bye.

82
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,666
So, what are you doing for your birthday?

83
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,125
-Pretending like it's not happening.
-Sunday, right?

84
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,416
I'm not celebrating it. Can't afford it.

85
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,541
-What can I get you?
-A pound of green beans, please.

86
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,541
Maybe we could do something
with Sien and Willem?

87
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,750
Well it would have to be
a very budget-friendly activity.

88
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,500
-Anything else?
-A butterhead lettuce, please.

89
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,666
-We could go camping for the weekend.
-Camping?

90
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,958
It's the perfect antidote
to panic attacks and hyperventilation.

91
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:02,083
With Sien and Willem?
They'll think I've lost the plot!

92
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,166
It'll be fun.
Get out into the countryside.

93
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,958
And it means you won't have to worry
about throwing a party.

94
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,625
-Butterhead lettuce.
-And a pound of asparagus. That's it.

95
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,708
Hm, yeah, great. All of us camping
together, the great outdoors…

96
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,375
That'll be 8.50, please.

97
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,750
It'll be fine. The weather's going to be
lovely this weekend.

98
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,875
See?

99
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,916
HAVE YOU GOT A SLEEPING BAG
I CAN BORROW?

100
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,541
<i>We'll be discussing the flooding</i>
<i>in Bangladesh in just a moment.</i>

101
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,833
<i>But before that, let's look at today's</i>
<i>parliamentary debate about tax increases.</i>

102
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,083
<i>Tim, you've been following the debate.</i>
<i>What can you tell us?</i>

103
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:46,125
<i>Emotions were running high,</i>
<i>even during the opening remarks.</i>

104
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,583
<i>It appears,</i>
<i>from the minister of finance's speech,</i>

105
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,166
<i>that his party, the Labor party</i>
<i>will need to retract</i>

106
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,125
<i>their earlier announcements</i>
<i>of tax increases for the highest earners.</i>

107
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,333
<i>The new measures proposed</i>
<i>by the minister are less far-reaching</i>

108
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,666
<i>than those announced</i>
<i>during the election campaign.</i>

109
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,541
<i>A notable change in policy…</i>

110
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,500
Hi, sweetheart.

111
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:50,750
Listen, if you need some more money
to tide you over…

112
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,291
No, it's fine.

113
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:57,875
-I'm just gonna go and…
-OK.

114
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,750
Shall we just forget about
the responsible parent chat for tonight?

115
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,708
Yeah. Well, goodnight, then.

116
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:45,625
Oh, Tim asked if we want
to go camping with him this weekend.

117
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,333
-If you don't feel like it…
-If they've got Wi-Fi, I don't mind.

118
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:58,916
-Perhaps you'd like to invite Janne along?
-No.

119
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,541
Oh. OK.

120
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,666
Well, sleep well, then, eh?

121
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,791
Night.

122
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,375
I've decided to take some serious action.

123
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,666
Yeah, I can tell.

124
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,041
I've bought a book that tells you
exactly what you should and shouldn't eat.

125
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,791
I'm taking Friday mornings off,
and I've signed up for a half marathon.

126
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,083
-Jesus Christ.
-So now there's no backing out.

127
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,750
The kids are all grown up

128
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,833
and Daniel is never
not at the tennis club.

129
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:48,166
-So, I thought: now is the moment.
-Yes, you're absolutely right, sis.

130
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,541
"Be happy with the little things.
With the flowers, trees and bees."

131
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,250
"With the birds that sing,
and you'll always be at peace."

132
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,625
"From your sister Doris."
Not a bad philosophy for life.

133
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,458
Where are the damn things?

134
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,208
Saar?

135
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:14,291
Do you ever dream about someone else?

136
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,958
Someone other than Daniel, I mean.

137
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,125
Well, not very often, unfortunately. Why?

138
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,166
Lately, I keep dreaming about Tim.

139
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,708
Oh.

140
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,541
What kind of dreams?

141
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:39,083
Very kind of romantic,
costume drama type situations.

142
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:44,416
Yesterday, when I was at the market
with him, I suddenly thought…

143
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,208
What?

144
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,208
I'm going to give you a massive kiss.

145
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,166
-A massive one?
-Yeah. Massive.

146
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,958
Then he called Lynn.
You know, his colleague off the TV.

147
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,625
-They're together, right?
-They are?

148
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,625
-I thought I read it somewhere.
-Damn it.

149
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,958
I think I'm…

150
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,458
I think I'm jealous.

151
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,375
-It's very strange.
-Yes.

152
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,541
-Don't you think?
-Yes, it is a bit.

153
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:23,458
Generally speaking, I'm not
particularly inclined to kiss my friends.

154
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,250
-Even if I'm at the market.
-No, me neither.

155
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,333
-Does that mean that…?
-Yes, I think it does.

156
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:36,666
-But it's also kind of nice, isn't it?
-Nice? It makes it super complicated.

157
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,708
-Why?
-Because Tim is my best friend.

158
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,791
-So?
-He's always been there,

159
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,208
even when everything
is messed up and goes wrong.

160
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,000
He's just about
the only stable thing in my life.

161
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,125
So what?
-Well.

162
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:54,541
There's nothing to say
he has these 'massive kiss' feelings too.

163
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,708
-You don't know that.
-What's more,

164
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,791
you're telling me
there's something going on

165
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,416
between him and that mannequin
he sits next to every night

166
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,916
who never gets tongue-tied
and has 18,995 followers on Instagram?

167
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,291
It might not even be true. I thought…

168
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,416
If I bother him with this,
I might mess everything up

169
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,500
and it might never be fun
or nice between us ever again.

170
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,666
But if you say nothing at all,
it might turn into an even bigger mess.

171
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,833
Door, just tell him.
Just put two folding chairs by the tent

172
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,916
and say, "Sit down, Tim.
I've got something to tell you."

173
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,458
I really wanted to kiss you at the market.

174
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,791
Yeah. You'll be fine.
There you go. Have fun.

175
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,625
I'll call you later, all right? Bye.

176
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,625
-D.G. Dorenbos?
-Yes.

177
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,125
You need to sign for this.

178
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,041
Hi, Janne. How's things?
-Good.

179
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,041
Mom, the cheese is all gone.
And the ketchup too.

180
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,458
-Oh.
-The whole fridge is empty.

181
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,833
OK. I guess I'll go
and do some groceries, then.

182
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,958
WE BUY GOLD

183
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:57,375
Hey, listen, Tim,

184
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,458
there's something I wanted to…
something I wanted to talk to you about.

185
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,416
I've got something to tell you.
I've noticed…

186
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:09,875
Hi.

187
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,833
Let's sit down a moment.

188
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,708
There's something important
I want to talk to you about.

189
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,500
Would you mind
taking off all your clothes?

190
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,166
Sien, are you coming?

191
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,333
-What's this?
-A sky lantern.

192
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,291
A sky lantern. Of course.

193
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,375
-I think we've got everything.
-I hope so.

194
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,916
-Every summer with the scouts…
-I always wanted to do that.

195
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,250
Were you in the scouts?

196
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,541
Mom wouldn't let us. She thinks
the scouts are politically incorrect.

197
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,500
-That's right.
-I had the time of my life.

198
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,000
I looked forward to it all year.

199
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,166
We never went to a campsite.
No, we'd go wild camping.

200
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,541
Where did you shower?

201
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,791
No showers. We'd swim in a forest lake.
Nice and stinky.

202
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,208
Wonderful. Airing your manhood
in all that wonderful fresh air.

203
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,958
We'd dig a hole in the ground
and that was our toilet.

204
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,083
What did you do all day?
Look for tracks? Hunt foxes?

205
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,041
-Sing fascist songs, perhaps?
-We did nothing of the sort.

206
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,541
We were lovely little boys
with our short shorts and neckerchiefs

207
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,625
and badges that we were very proud of.

208
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,166
I promise to do my best
to be a good cub scout,

209
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,750
to help others whenever I can,
and to follow the cub scout code of honor.

210
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,458
-You can count on me.
-You can count on me.

211
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,541
-Where is Willem?
-Looking for a socket.

212
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,375
-Jesus, Mom.
-It's a classic tent.

213
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,166
-You know, the Albatross.
-Albatross?

214
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,583
Yes, with an awning and two rooms.

215
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,875
It's indestructible.
I've had it for 25 years.

216
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,541
-I'm going for a wee.
-You'd better be coming back!

217
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,458
After I undo this, it'll be up in no time.

218
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:16,000
<i>We are the cubs,</i>
<i>And we love the forest</i>

219
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,208
<i>-You can have a run around--</i>
-Give it a rest.

220
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,208
Listen, Mister…

221
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,750
it's the anniversary
of my father's death next week

222
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,250
and my mother has invited us all

223
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:44,041
to do
a sort of memorial ceremony type thing

224
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,083
-and she wondered if you'd like to come?
-I'd love to.

225
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,583
Really? Don't feel obliged to come.

226
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,916
-It'll probably be really boring.
-Of course I'll come.

227
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,041
Crikey, has it already been a year?

228
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,958
It's enough to make you crazy,
the way time just flies.

229
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,833
You make a couple of sandwiches,
take out the trash,

230
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,458
put up the Christmas decorations,

231
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,708
-and before you know it…
-And just like that you're 45.

232
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,541
Thanks so much for pointing that out.

233
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,958
-Perfect time for some mindfulness.
-Shove it!

234
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,166
It's very good for anxiety.

235
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,083
Pass.

236
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,166
It doesn't count
because you didn't say "last card."

237
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,083
-That's not fair.
-It's what we just agreed.

238
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,125
-I was finally going to win for once.
-Those are the rules.

239
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:31,250
Rules… Is that how it's going to be?
Is it going to be one of those weekends?

240
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,500
Stop whining, Mom.

241
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:38,000
The fascist boy scout comes crawling
out of his tent with his rules.

242
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,458
-You're just a bad loser.
-I am not.

243
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,625
-I'm going to open another bag of nuts.
-Hurrah!

244
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:53,791
-Have you ever been camping before?
-Sure. 33 years ago.

245
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,291
That's when…

246
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,750
That's when I went to England for a week
with my friend Marion and her parents.

247
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:10,125
We were camped next to
a young couple in a tiny little tent.

248
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,708
They spent the whole week,
and I mean the whole week, bonking.

249
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,875
-Bonking?
-Yes, bonking.

250
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:22,333
From early in the morning to late at night
with all the sound effects.

251
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:27,541
All the time there'd be an arm
or a leg pushing against the tent walls.

252
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,458
-Don't do that. You'll make the tent leak.
-Yeah, yeah.

253
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,166
The funny thing was
that for the whole week,

254
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,708
Marion's parents pretended
there was absolutely nothing going on.

255
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:44,291
Every now and then the zipper would open,
and out came two bright-red,

256
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,250
overheated, sticky 18 year olds.

257
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:50,166
I guess they were going
to get something to eat or do groceries.

258
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,541
And an hour later, off they went again.
Zipper open, tent closed, zipper closed…

259
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,958
-OK, Mom. We get it.
-Thanks. Can we go to sleep now?

260
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,708
Sorry. Sorry.

261
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,291
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

262
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,916
-Good night, cub scouts.
-Sleep well.

263
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:18,291
-Are you warm enough?
-I think so.

264
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,125
-Scary dreams?
-No.

265
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,750
It's fine.

266
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,500
It's raining.

267
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:29,083
As it should be.
The ultimate camping experience.

268
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,000
-Sorry.
-Rubbish.

269
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:42,541
No, that was the wind.
It was the wind. It was.

270
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,708
Sorry.

271
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,625
Or a Biodanza workshop?

272
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,166
-Let loose a bit.
-Oh, wonderful.

273
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,333
What's happened here?

274
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,833
Has someone walked into it or something?

275
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,875
-That's odd.
-Yeah.

276
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:59,791
-Tim, I just wanted to…
-Mom.

277
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,875
Mom. They've got tandem bikes for rent.

278
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,500
-Oh!
-We should do it.

279
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,833
-I don't know, sweetie.
-That's a good idea.

280
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,041
-Is that at reception?
-Yes.

281
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,958
Great for middle-aged people like us.

282
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:16,166
Nice bit of cycling. I hope you brought
your functional windbreaker.

283
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:39,000
-Look! A squirrel.
-Ow. You yelled right in my ear.

284
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,875
Here's to a really lovely day.

285
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,250
Come on, then.

286
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,458
Tim, I…

287
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:16,958
Recently, I've…

288
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,541
Sometimes I think that I…

289
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,125
-You think you what?
-Well, that I…

290
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, now I really want to know.

291
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:40,791
After the divorce,
I really thought I would never…

292
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:46,208
I mean, I had no desire
or inclination to… with anyone…

293
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:51,208
-To what…?
-I don't know.

294
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:54,083
At our age, we're so…

295
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,875
Well, who we are.

296
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:02,291
With an instruction manual as long
as your arm. And so stuck in our ways.

297
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,666
Especially with Willem and Sien in tow.

298
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:11,375
The three of us are this beautiful,
complex, fragile unit.

299
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:16,208
I always thought, how could we possibly
add anyone to that. It'd be impossible.

300
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,458
The whole structure would collapse.

301
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:23,083
-But?
-But…

302
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,833
Now, I'm starting to think
it might be possible.

303
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,333
With the right person.

304
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:41,541
For the first time,
I feel like that's what I really want.

305
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:45,500
Wait a minute. Are you saying…

306
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:50,333
Are you saying
you want to try and find someone?

307
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,583
-That's great.
-No.

308
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,500
Like on Tinder or something?

309
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:57,291
-No, no.
-Hi, Tim speaking. No. It's no problem.

310
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:05,958
Yes, I'm on a camp site near Kootwijk.

311
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,291
Yes, that's right. By the shifting sands.

312
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,375
What, really?

313
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:15,083
Oh, just with some friends.

314
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:24,583
-Mom, check it out. Mom.
-Door.

315
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,791
You have to make a wish, Mom.

316
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:36,416
Here it goes, Door.

317
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,541
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow,</i>
<i>And so say all of us!</i>

318
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,041
<i>-Hip hip hurray!</i>
-Hurray.

319
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,750
Well, Doris Dorenbos,
it's time for a little speech.

320
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:33,500
In every person's life,
there are good times…

321
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,916
-And bad times.
-…and bad times.

322
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,083
No, life will not spare us.

323
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,458
Thankfully,
there is such a thing as friendship.

324
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:45,916
Until death do us part,
in sickness and in health.

325
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,625
And when you know each other
as well as we do…

326
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:52,333
You know that I like apple sauce
with my pasta.

327
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:56,083
-Yuck!
-And I know you're not a very good singer,

328
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:59,000
and that you fancy men
in corduroy jackets.

329
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,416
-Is that your type?
-Yes.

330
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,750
When you know so many embarrassing,

331
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:07,500
call them intolerable things,
about each other,

332
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:11,375
then you can really speak
of a true friendship.

333
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:16,041
And to honor this heartfelt connection,

334
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:20,958
I would like to give you
this piece of jewelry. Please stand up.

335
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,791
Give me your arm.

336
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:35,750
Oh, that's so sweet.

337
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:42,375
-Took me a long time to save up for that.
-Very cool, Mom.

338
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,916
To my BFF, from Tim.

339
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,458
I had no idea what to get,
so this is a little joke.

340
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,958
Let me take you shopping
for something special.

341
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,000
Well, thank you very much.

342
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:03,333
-Another cup of coffee, Missus?
-Yes, please.

343
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:07,708
And then this birthday girl is going
to brave the creepy campsite showers.

344
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,666
-Hi, Lynn.
-Good morning, everyone.

345
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,208
-This is a surprise.
-Yes, I had some work things,

346
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:22,291
so I thought I'd bring them to you.

347
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:26,583
OK. Great. That's very kind of you.

348
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:33,291
-This is Willem and Sien.
-Hi.

349
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:37,125
And that is Doris Dorenbos.
It's her birthday today.

350
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,083
Yeah.

351
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:41,333
-Right, well, happy birthday.
-Thank you.

352
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,500
Would you like something to eat
or some coffee?

353
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,250
There's a cafe at the entrance.
Shall we go and sit there?

354
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:56,708
-It's probably quieter.
-Yes. Good plan. Let's do that.

355
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,125
-OK. See you later.
-Bye.

356
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,333
Bye.

357
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,083
Bit strange of her to visit, wasn't it?

358
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,708
-What do you mean?
-Well, I mean…

359
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:04,416
It's a bit odd for a colleague to turn up
out of the blue on a Sunday morning

360
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,000
on a campsite
an hour and a half's drive from Amsterdam.

361
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,416
Her parents live nearby.

362
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,500
But she could have just dropped those
papers in your mailbox, couldn't she?

363
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,666
Wim, could you give me a hand
with the washing up?

364
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,750
-Do I have to?
-Yes, you do.

365
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,125
Tim, can I ask you something?

366
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:49,375
I'm sick of it.
I'm behaving like a 13-year-old, Sarah.

367
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,291
Get rid of Sien and Willem for a bit
and then talk to him.

368
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:57,500
No, because I just don't know…
No, I just can't do…

369
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,583
See? As you can tell, I've taken on
some kind of totally incoherent form.

370
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:04,500
-I'm some sort of blob.
-Just talk to him, Door.

371
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:08,833
You'll feel much better for it.
How difficult can it be?

372
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:12,708
<i>We are the cubs,</i>
<i>We love the forest</i>

373
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,791
<i>You can run around there,</i>
<i>And look for a fox</i>

374
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:20,583
<i>We swim and we cycle,</i>
<i>Lots of fun for you and me</i>

375
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:25,208
<i>There's nowhere in the world</i>
<i>I would rather be</i>

376
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,000
-Bye, guys.
-I had a great time.

377
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,375
Me too.

378
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:49,250
Tim, could you sit down for a minute?

379
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:55,083
I want to tell you something.
It's important.

380
00:38:57,416 --> 00:39:00,666
-Yes. I have something to tell you too.
-Oh.

381
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,458
I… Oh.

382
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:10,041
I had a really great time
with Willem and Sien.

383
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:16,958
I really enjoyed it.
And they absolutely adore you.

384
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:19,541
Well, the feeling's mutual.

385
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,833
What I wanted to say is, I…

386
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:31,291
I've noticed the past couple of months
that I've been longing for a family.

387
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:36,750
It's quite strange really,
after all these years of being a bachelor.

388
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,666
-I was always just busy with work.
-Do you mean…

389
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,916
Lynn is kind of in the same boat.

390
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:49,458
She's 36,
and she'd quite like to have children.

391
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,708
But…

392
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,166
But it's not something you can just…

393
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,583
It's… a huge decision.

394
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,416
Yeah. For sure. Totally.

395
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,750
-But this weekend…
-This weekend was really great.

396
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:16,125
Life isn't one long camping fest,
filled with pastries and ice cream.

397
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,916
It seems to me you have
a rather naive and romantic picture

398
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,583
of what it means to have a family.

399
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:28,541
-I don't think it's that bad.
-Sorry, but I don't think you realize

400
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,958
how demanding and tough it can
be to be responsible for children.

401
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:34,250
Well maybe it's high time I found out.

402
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,000
It's just that…

403
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:49,166
When you told me about your decision
to start looking for love,

404
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,666
I thought, yes, she's right.

405
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,625
I should be brave too and just go for it.

406
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:01,375
Wait a minute. You can't just
throw yourself into something

407
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,500
because you're in the same boat, Tim.

408
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,500
It's not exactly unexpected.

409
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:07,333
It's just I never
looked into it properly before.

410
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,916
But now suddenly you are?
Suddenly you're like,

411
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,750
it's Sunday May 17th, I'm going to start
a family with my colleague off the TV.

412
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,333
I'm not saying it's going to happen
immediately. All I'm saying

413
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:21,208
is that, like you, perhaps it's time
I got serious about it and…

414
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:24,083
Christ!
Why are you reacting so aggressively.

415
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:30,458
I understand that it would be nice
if I could be more enthusiastic.

416
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:33,625
I understand that.
But I just can't right now, OK?

417
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,375
<i>I really like</i>
<i>how you've combined the chocolate</i>

418
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,666
<i>with the cookie dough and the nuts.</i>

419
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,666
<i>But the execution with the cream</i>
<i>is a bit greasy.</i>

420
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,875
<i>I like the idea,</i>
<i>but I'm not so keen on the result.</i>

421
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,666
<i>-A music cake.</i>
<i>-Fabulous.</i>

422
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,708
<i>-A Phantom of the Opera cake.</i>
<i>-I can see the logic.</i>

423
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:50,458
Darling, you spent years
working for Walter.

424
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:53,708
You gave up your studies
to go and work in his first shop.

425
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,500
Don't you think I know that?

426
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:59,958
-So, it's perfectly normal to get alimony.
-I don't want to talk about it.

427
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,708
I'll find something.

428
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,833
I'm doing a trial shift
at a restaurant soon.

429
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,208
You never know, I might really enjoy it.

430
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:10,750
Here it is.

431
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:14,625
-Should I come and give you a hand?
-No, you've already got your hands full.

432
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:19,625
Look, it's from Tim. I found it
behind a cupboard. It's from 1987.

433
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:26,500
MY FATHER KEEPS DRIVING
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD,

434
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,791
SO I DOUBT I'LL SURVIVE THIS TRIP.

435
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:32,208
FAREWELL AND SEE YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE. BEST WISHES, TIM

436
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,750
The thing is, Door,
this house is full of memories.

437
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:51,666
-But that's nice, though, isn't it?
-Yes, it's nice but also not nice.

438
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,083
What's this?

439
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:58,916
The rose bush out there
was a wedding present from my parents.

440
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,958
It used to be in the garden of the house
where you and Sarah were born.

441
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,708
When we moved house,
Dad dug it up and we took it with us.

442
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:10,208
But it's too big to move now.
It wouldn't survive that.

443
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:13,041
-So that's a cutting?
-Yes.

444
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:17,916
I want to plant it in my new garden
on Sunday when we're all together.

445
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:25,208
A kind of symbolic… Well…
I thought we could honor it in that way.

446
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:33,958
-Do you want a sandwich?
-Yes. Good plan.

447
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:37,208
-Peanut butter or roast beef?
-Roast beef with loads of salt.

448
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,791
There you go.

449
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:46,291
-I'd like to pay.
-I'll be right with you.

450
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,458
-Did you enjoy that?
-Yes.

451
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,791
-Sixteen fifty, please.
-Can I pay by card?

452
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,375
There you go.

453
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,541
Thank you.

454
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,208
Oh, it says "payment unsuccessful."

455
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,750
Have either of you got any money on you?

456
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,458
-There you go.
-Thank you.

457
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,541
I'll pay you back, love.

458
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:33,500
Do you mind if Janne comes
to Grandad's memorial thing?

459
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,500
-Of course not.
-Tim's coming too, isn't he?

460
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:39,875
-Well, I actually don't know.
-Why? What happened?

461
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:42,291
-I thought he promised?
-Maybe he has to--

462
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,208
-Have you fallen out?
-Thanks. I'm just going to the bathroom.

463
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:03,541
Guys, this is Doris. She's doing
a trial shift as a server this evening.

464
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,625
-Hi, I'm Ahmed.
-Hi, Doris, I'm Gijs.

465
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,916
Great, so if you just…

466
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:14,708
OK, so that's two beers and… and…

467
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:20,916
a glass of red wine…
and a glass of water.

468
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,583
-And a gin and tonic.
-Oh, of course, sorry. Gin and tonic.

469
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,291
OK. I'll bring that out to you.

470
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,541
Gin and tonic.

471
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,541
-Table four have been waiting 10 minutes.
-I'm going over there now.

472
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:55,875
-It's Doris, right?
-Yes, that's right.

473
00:46:56,708 --> 00:47:00,625
-What would you like to drink?
-A glass of Chardonnay, please.

474
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,833
Char… don… nay.

475
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:11,500
-How are you?
-I don't think we have that.

476
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,500
-I'll have a beer.
-One beer.

477
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:24,958
Is this your restaurant?

478
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:31,500
No, I work here for 7.20 an hour,
including holiday allowance.

479
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,000
I'll go and get your drinks.

480
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,000
-Everything all right?
-Yeah.

481
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:04,500
Doris, table six can be cleared
and table eight wants coffee.

482
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:19,458
Would you like to look
at the dessert menu?

483
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,375
No. We do not want to look
at the dessert menu.

484
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,750
Where is the restroom?

485
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:28,833
Over there in the corner,
by the sign that says "restroom."

486
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,375
-Jesus, Door.
-Sorry, it's a very awkward situation.

487
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,958
Yes, but you don't need to take it out
on Lynn. It's not her fault.

488
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,833
I've got two cappuccinos
going cold over there.

489
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,958
Hey, Doris, fancy a gin and tonic?

490
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Sure. Why not.

491
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:05,083
If you don't want to,
you don't want to. Right?

492
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:09,541
-Do you want another one?
-Yeah, but after that mo nore.

493
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:14,750
-No more.
-Mo nore. Come here.

494
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,083
What are we doing, Mr. Grey?

495
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:42,208
-Let's not get too acrobatic, eh?
-Darling? Gijsje, are you asleep?

496
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,458
I got you a surprise.

497
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,958
God damn it.

498
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,333
God damn it.

499
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,083
Calm down, darling.

500
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:17,000
But we'd agreed. I wanted to surprise you.

501
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:21,375
-It's all right, darling.
-I can't deal with this.

502
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:25,083
We weren't going to do this anymore.
You're going to ruin everything.

503
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,416
You know that as well as I do.

504
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,041
When you say you need space

505
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:32,208
and you're going to sleep in the studio
for a couple of nights,

506
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,583
I should be able to trust you.

507
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:37,083
Otherwise, you need to be honest

508
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:42,000
and say there's someone else
I'd like to try stuff out with,

509
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,750
and then I'll keep my distance.

510
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,166
Do you understand?
So I can protect myself.

511
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:50,208
But she's not really anyone, you know?
I mean…

512
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:53,291
Do you realize how shit it feels
to stand here like this?

513
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:56,625
-This is so humiliating.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

514
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,333
I believe in us. I believe in this.

515
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:05,083
But if we're going
to allow each other that freedom,

516
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,416
that makes it a very fragile thing.

517
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,416
I know, darling. I don't know
what the hell I'm doing either.

518
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,083
I mean, look at me.
I bought a new bra.

519
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:20,208
I found a babysitter.
And I get here and…

520
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,666
Oh, jeez.

521
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,708
Oh, no.

522
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:13,750
Guys, have either of you seen my bracelet?

523
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:15,125
-No.
-No.

524
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:22,583
What's going on?

525
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:25,458
Why are you fully dressed
and eating breakfast

526
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:26,791
at nine on a Saturday morning?

527
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:29,125
Because Dad's expecting us
at quarter to ten.

528
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,958
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

529
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:43,583
That's my girl.

530
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,375
You can always FaceTime me.

531
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:54,833
You need to get a haircut, son.
You look ridiculous.

532
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:03,166
Let's go.

533
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:37,000
Thank you so much.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

534
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:41,416
-How did it go at the restaurant?
-Not great.

535
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,375
What's next?

536
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:47,666
Tomorrow I'm going to apply
for a job as a postman.

537
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:52,750
I'm trying to convince myself
that it's a very romantic profession.

538
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:57,125
This one's for Willem.
And this one's for Grandma.

539
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:58,750
I think that's everyone.

540
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:05,125
-I thought Tim was going to come.
-No, he had to work.

541
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:13,125
-Have you guys got the cutting?
-Yes.

542
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,958
-Door?
-Hi.

543
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,708
-Hi, Tim.
-You came.

544
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:27,833
-I didn't know if you wanted me to…
-Come on.

545
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:34,458
-This is Janne.
-Hi, Tim.

546
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,250
Well…

547
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,208
Dear Dad…

548
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:07,208
I remember how you used to get up
really early in the morning

549
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:10,666
before our birthday parties
when we were little

550
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,375
to go and set up the treasure hunt.

551
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:16,625
And in the afternoon,
after we'd had soda and cake,

552
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,916
the whole gang of us
would go to the forest

553
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,916
to look for the clues you'd hung up
and hunt for the treasure, of course,

554
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,041
that was buried somewhere
deep in the dark, dark woods.

555
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:33,583
But one time, some little yobs had gone
and pinched almost all of the clues,

556
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:37,666
which meant we couldn't find the trail
and got completely lost.

557
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:42,875
It took quite a lot of lollies
to get us back in the mood for a party.

558
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:50,375
That's kind of how it feels
now that you're no longer here.

559
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:59,291
Life has become a treasure hunt,
but someone's taken away all the clues.

560
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:04,958
But luckily,
I've got some lovely people in my life

561
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:08,958
who lovingly push me
in the right direction from time to time.

562
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,416
Or they grab me by the collar

563
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,500
when I'm about to fall
into a deep pit of hyperventilation.

564
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,458
And it helps.

565
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:22,791
It really helps.

566
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:29,958
Other than that, I assume,
just like in the old days,

567
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:33,208
you'll be waiting for us
at the end of the treasure hunt

568
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,833
in your duffel coat

569
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:39,708
in the dark, dark woods by the tree
where the treasure's buried.

570
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:48,041
Well, that's it.

571
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:11,166
Sorry.
-I need to go.

572
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:15,833
I understand. It was wonderful,
really nice that you came,

573
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:17,875
on behalf of the others too.

574
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:23,125
I…

575
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:29,083
I think we should talk
about what's going on.

576
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:34,666
Because you were behaving
very strangely at the restaurant.

577
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,791
Yes.

578
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,500
It's good
that we're both moving on, isn't it?

579
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,000
Absolutely.

580
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:49,708
We can still be friends, right?

581
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:54,958
Otherwise, this whole treasure hunt
doesn't seem much fun anymore.

582
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,750
And we might as well forget
about the stupid treasure.

583
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:04,250
I don't think I can do it.

584
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:07,708
Do what?

585
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:11,333
Carry on the way it was.

586
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,375
I… I have to go.
I need to get to the studio.

587
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:23,666
Yeah, go.

588
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:55,833
This is it.
Well, for this season, anyway.

589
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:56,916
In the winter they'll give me

590
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,666
an equally practical,
slightly thicker weather-proof outfit.

591
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,666
Is it an option
for you not to work in our neighborhood,

592
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,208
but somewhere else instead?

593
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:13,583
-Have fun.
-Yeah. Good luck, Mom.

594
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,625
Do you need me to do it?

595
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:56,083
{\an8}FRIENDS ARE SURE OF IT:
LYNN PREGNANT BY NEW COLLEAGUE

596
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,458
Hi, is your mom or dad at home?

597
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:47,666
-Mom.
-Coming.

598
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,041
Sorry.

599
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:04,375
I wanted to put this
through your mailbox,

600
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:05,958
but then it ripped.

601
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:08,875
-Who's that?
-No one, sweetie. Go and play.

602
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,291
I'm sorry about that,

603
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:13,875
and for…

604
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:17,125
-For the other thing.
-That and the other thing.

605
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:20,750
-Why are you angry with that lady?
-No reason, sweetie.

606
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:23,750
Well, I guess I'll be going then.

607
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:27,000
-Good idea. Kind regards.
-Mom…

608
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:31,750
Hang on a minute. That's my bracelet.

609
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:37,291
-Huh?
-Yes, that's my… That's my bracelet.

610
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:40,625
-Oh, really? Wow.
-Can I please have it back?

611
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:44,458
-It's mine, isn't it, Mom?
-No, it's mine.

612
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:50,875
My best friend gave it to me
and I'm very attached to it.

613
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:54,625
-Are you seriously going to cry now?
-It's mine.

614
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:57,208
Of course it's not yours.
Do you know what it says?

615
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:59,125
"From Tim, to my BFF."
Do you know anyone called Tim?

616
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,750
-It's mine.
-No, it's mine.

617
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:04,083
Get your hands off my child.

618
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:08,333
There, bitch. Take your damn bracelet.
Now get out of here.

619
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,791
-Cool outfit.
-I…

620
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,416
I'm not doing too great.

621
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,333
Well, actually, we're not doing great.

622
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:49,875
No.

623
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:53,208
Why didn't you call me back?

624
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:56,041
This new career opportunity
has been keeping me busy.

625
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:00,916
And to honest, I didn't feel like hearing

626
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,333
all your pink fluffy love child stories.

627
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:06,875
You don't believe all that stuff, do you?

628
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,666
I really think…

629
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:15,583
I really think
there are some things we need to discuss

630
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:18,166
if we want to stay friends…

631
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:22,791
-until death do us part, so to speak.
-Yes.

632
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:27,125
-But not right now.
-Why not?

633
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,750
It's not a good time.

634
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:31,875
Because…?

635
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:37,708
-Because I've got guests.
-Oh, OK.

636
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:42,916
Could we go and get a drink
round the corner instead then?

637
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:47,166
-Because I really wanted to…
-Now's not…

638
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,000
I just have to…

639
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:54,541
-I'll call you later, OK?
-Fine.

640
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:58,208
Whatever.com.

641
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:35,791
-Oh, you found it.
-Yes.

642
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,416
Darling, I don't feel very well.

643
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,375
Do you think
you could make dinner for you and Willem?

644
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:45,416
-Sure.
-I'm going to go lie down.

645
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,250
Mom, I'm home.

646
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:55,041
Mom. Mom.

647
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,208
Mom.

648
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:03,541
Mom?

649
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:06,916
She didn't wake up when I went in either.
Don't you think that's strange?

650
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:11,750
-Should I call Grandma? Or Tim?
-Yes. Call Tim.

651
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:19,958
Door?

652
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:23,041
Doortje?

653
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:27,833
I'm so cold.

654
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,708
-Could you fetch an extra blanket?
-Yeah.

655
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:44,041
-Dr. Schellekens is your doctor, right?
-Yes.

656
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,708
-There.
-I'll go.

657
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,916
Give her the first dose straight away.
You'll need to keep an eye on her tonight.

658
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,291
If something feels off, or her fever
gets worse, call an ambulance.

659
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:03,750
All the best.

660
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:38,833
Yeah?

661
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:43,958
How are you getting on
with your homework?

662
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,541
Not too bad.

663
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,583
OK. Well, sleep well.

664
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,333
Why are you and Mom fighting?

665
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,250
I…

666
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:01,375
Is it because you're having a baby
with Lynn?

667
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:05,208
We're not having a baby.
We barely know each other.

668
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:06,500
That's a relief.

669
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:11,166
I don't think you understand
how having kids works.

670
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,000
In what way?

671
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:18,916
Well, that it's strange
if to start with you're around a lot

672
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,708
for dinner and Saint Nicholas and stuff
and that it's really nice,

673
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:26,166
and then you have a great time
going camping together,

674
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:31,791
but then you suddenly disappear
and never get in touch anymore.

675
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,041
No…

676
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,375
I mean, yes.

677
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:52,875
I'm sorry.

678
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,125
OK.

679
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:10,291
Wim?

680
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,916
-Have you made a move yet?
-No.

681
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,791
My advice is, and it's probably best
you don't follow it,

682
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:21,000
because no one is better
at messing things up than me.

683
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:26,041
But in case you still want my advice,
then it would be this: Tell it like it is.

684
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,125
I think that's the least disastrous
of all the options.

685
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:33,500
-OK, sleep well.
-You too.

686
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,250
Sleep well, Door.

687
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:21,833
No.

688
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:25,208
No.

689
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:48,166
Doortje?

690
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:51,750
Doortje?

691
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,750
Door.

692
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:57,083
Doortje.

693
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:21,958
I must look drop dead gorgeous right now.

694
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,791
Heidi Klum's got nothing on you.

695
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:29,750
-Did you sleep here?
-The doctor told me to keep an eye on you.

696
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:34,041
That's very sweet of you.

697
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:36,916
-I'm just keeping my cub scout's promise.
-You can…

698
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,083
You can count on me.

699
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,583
Willem was at my place

700
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,458
when you called round the other day.

701
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:58,666
That's why I couldn't let you in.
He wanted my advice.

702
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,791
He's in love with Janne

703
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:05,791
and he doesn't know
whether or not to tell her.

704
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:10,458
When he saw you at the door

705
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:14,208
he was worried you'd feel sidelined.

706
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:17,833
I'm just really happy
he talked to you about it.

707
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:18,916
Yeah.

708
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,708
I actually felt quite proud.

709
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,041
Tim, I…

710
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:36,791
Good morning, Ms. Dorenbos.
I've come to see how you're doing.

711
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:38,666
Hi, sweetheart.

712
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,125
-Quite a bit better, it would seem.
-Yes, much better.

713
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:44,083
Hi, love.

714
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:50,833
-Have you heard back yet?
-Yes. She didn't dare to say it either.

715
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,541
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

716
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:56,958
Thirty-seven point six. That's very good.
Make sure you finish the treatment

717
01:14:57,041 --> 01:15:00,541
followed by a week of taking it very easy.
Understood?

718
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:03,666
I'll see you out.

719
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:13,708
My darlings. Eat your breakfast
and go to school. Chop, chop.

720
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,291
Off you go.

721
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:11,625
HOPEFULLY YOU LIKE THIS ONE TOO

722
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:30,000
-Hi.
-Hello, Mom.

723
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:39,541
-We'll try… We'll try…
-That's it.

724
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,416
To be honest, I miss print journalism.

725
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,416
I've got a meeting
with the newspaper next week.

726
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,291
I need to tell you something.

727
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,791
It's important.

728
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:33,875
I'm so sorry
I put off telling you for so long,

729
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:37,416
and that I totally overcomplicated it.

730
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:41,416
But I just didn't know how…

731
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,208
What I should…

732
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:49,333
And, honestly, I still don't know…

733
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,125
what the future looks like for us.

734
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:58,666
There's nothing I want more
than to make stupid jokes the whole time

735
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:02,708
and stay friends forever,
for Sien and Willem's sake too.

736
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,583
But I don't know how to anymore.

737
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:13,375
Because when I see you and Lynn together
or think about your being together

738
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:18,666
I turn into this great big,
green, humorless monster.

739
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:25,791
So, the children are going
to stay with Walter for a bit

740
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:29,375
and then I'm going camping
with them in England.

741
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:34,791
I hope that by the end of the summer,
I'll be able to behave normally to you,

742
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:41,791
and that we'll be able to have nice meals
together again like this evening.

743
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:45,791
But without having to suppress the urge

744
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:51,750
to press you up against the wall
and tear all your clothes off.

745
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,166
I'll see you in a couple of months, Tim.

746
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:46,958
Look after yourselves.

747
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:01,916
What now?

748
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,166
We're going to find a bus
to take us to the campsite.

749
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:16,458
FOLLOW THE RED RIBBONS

750
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:18,875
Follow the red ribbons.

751
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:34,916
I…

752
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,416
I'm not literature professor

753
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:44,041
and, if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not that keen on tea.

754
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,791
But I can't imagine anything better
than talking to you all day long

755
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:59,166
about daffodils and payment demands
and about savory snacks and Bake Off.

756
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:05,250
Because the thing is,
my dear, awkward best friend forever

757
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,958
that for a very long time, you have been,

758
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:12,083
and I'm talking about as far back
as when ABBA were still around,

759
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:18,541
you have been the greatest,

760
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:22,750
mail-delivering,
hyperventilating love of my life.

761
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:30,000
And all my tragic attempts
to get together with anyone else

762
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:34,083
or to throw myself into something
were desperate attempts

763
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:38,041
by this poor soul
to try to come to terms

764
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:42,416
with what I thought was

765
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:45,666
the bitter truth.

766
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:52,958
So, if you would be willing

767
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:57,458
in between all our civilized conversations

768
01:24:57,541 --> 01:25:02,916
and all our attempts at creating
responsible parental structures

769
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,041
where I'm not trying
to be Willem and Sien's father,

770
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:08,958
but in which I make it clear to them
that I like them much more

771
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:10,625
than any love child…

772
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:14,583
If you would be prepared,
in between all of that,

773
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:18,000
to pin me against the wall
once in a while…

774
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:21,875
and tear the clothes of my body,

775
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:26,333
then I think I will have to be
very careful not to die of happiness.

776
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:33,291
I thought about arranging a horse

777
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:38,750
for us to climb onto and ride off on.

778
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,833
Maybe you should just shut your mouth.
