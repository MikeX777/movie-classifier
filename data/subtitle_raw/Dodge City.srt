1
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,485
There's the 23rd marker, sir.

2
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,113
Twenty-three miles
in one hour and 14 minutes.

3
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,906
Gentlemen, that is moving.

4
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,617
Our engineer is trying to set a record
on the first run.

5
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:01,162
But I doubt if we can maintain this speed
on our regular schedule.

6
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,290
Why not? If this train can do it,
the rest of them can.

7
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,752
Providing Col. Dodge's new town
is worth speeding to reach.

8
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,379
Worth it? You wait and see.

9
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,007
Now it's just the end of the line,
but in a few years...

10
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,343
it'll give your railroad more business
than any town west of Chicago.

11
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,305
I hope you're right, Colonel. You've stuck
to that argument for five years.

12
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,515
Why shouldn't l?

13
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,144
I've raised that town
from two hog pens and a buffalo waller.

14
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,896
How big is it now, Colonel?

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,443
Well, at the last census, gentlemen,
they had three buffalo wallers.

16
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,073
Look, there goes the stagecoach
from Wichita.

17
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,325
We'll be carrying the mail from now on.

18
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,332
Listen to that snorting teapot.
She's already winded.

19
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,418
By Jove, we'll run her into the ground.

20
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,545
Better put your whip to them.

21
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,345
-Willie?
-Yes, sir, boss?

22
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,138
You go up and tell our engineer...

23
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,224
if that stagecoach beats us
to the end of the line, he's fired.

24
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,727
Yes, sir. And if this train go any faster...

25
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,354
I'm gonna get off and walk...

26
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,898
'cause I don't like this zest of the Lord.

27
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,384
By George, he's making a good showing,
you know it.

28
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,095
-We'll get him.
-We'd better get up some speed here.

29
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,471
-There he goes.
-We've got him.

30
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,939
Gentlemen, that's a symbol
of America's future: progress.

31
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,901
Iron men and iron horses.
You can't beat them.

32
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,050
Lucky devils.
Nothing to do, but eat and sleep.

33
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,551
That's right, hardhead.

34
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,637
The only difference between you and them
is a pair of horns.

35
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,847
Hush.

36
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,100
Say, Wade, let's cut out a couple of them.

37
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,853
No. We've killed our last buffalo, boys.

38
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,647
The railroad's finished
and so is our contract.

39
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,859
Besides, we've a little appointment
to keep, you know.

40
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,152
Come on.

41
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,309
Here comes our meal ticket
for the last six months.

42
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,771
So that's what a steam engine looks like:
a coffeepot on wheels.

43
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,565
Come on,
let's pay our respects to the Colonel.

44
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,962
-Hello, Colonel. How are you?
-Fine, son. See you soon.

45
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,296
We'll be there.

46
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,557
By golly, Dodge,
you know everybody in Kansas.

47
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,976
Not quite.
Those boys have been working for us...

48
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,270
hunting buffalo
to feed our construction gang.

49
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,106
The young lrishman is Wade Hatton.
I met him during the war.

50
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,358
He fought for the rebels
in Jeb Stuart's cavalry.

51
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,570
Been everywhere, done everything.
Sort of a rover.

52
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,489
Well, it takes all sorts of men
to build a railroad.

53
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,325
No, sir. Just a couple of us lrishmen.

54
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,416
On your toes, men!
We're gonna start moving.

55
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,293
Watch those hides they don't slip.

56
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,545
Keep on your toes.
We're gonna start moving.

57
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,630
You drivers keep close together.

58
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,219
Ready to start whenever you say, Jeff.

59
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,430
All right, let's move fast!

60
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,584
-Which one of you men is Jeff Surrett?
-I am. Why?

61
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,921
I'm John Barlow, Commissioner
of lndian Affairs, from Kansas.

62
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,174
-You're under arrest. All three of you.
-For what?

63
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,052
For the illegal killing of buffalo
and selling their hides.

64
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,846
We got those buffalo on free land,
just the same as he did.

65
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,100
He has a government permit
to kill buffalo for the railroad workers.

66
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,686
-You got any such permit?
-No.

67
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,272
-ls this some of your business, Hatton?
-I made it my business.

68
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,734
As soon as I found out you were
shooting buffalo on lndian territory...

69
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,487
stealing the hides,
and letting the meat rot in the sun.

70
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,532
When any lndians protested,
you shot them down in cold blood.

71
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,158
This has been going on all winter.

72
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,035
It took you till now to catch up with us?

73
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,956
We didn't want to. We just watched you
and counted the animals you killed.

74
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,376
You're lying. You'd have made them
stop us before, if you'd known.

75
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,755
Why? It seemed a better idea to let
you and your pals work your head off...

76
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,259
packing and curing those hides
until they caught you.

77
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,553
So that's why you waited so long?

78
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,098
The lndians might just as well
get the hides in good salable condition.

79
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,599
All right, Hatton.

80
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,020
But I hope you stick around Kansas
for a long time...

81
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,481
because we're gonna collect
for every one of those hides in full.

82
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,609
Right. If you're ever around our way,
look us up.

83
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,404
All right, boys.

84
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,662
-Congratulations, Colonel.
-Thanks, Rusty.

85
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,374
Wade, you've been a great help
in building this railroad.

86
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,834
Now the real work begins.
We've got to make it pay.

87
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,002
That's up to you.

88
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,631
No, it isn't. I've got other work to do.
We're looking further westward.

89
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,342
I want you to take charge here,
help build up this town.

90
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,761
-Organize trade for our road.
-No, thanks, sir.

91
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,473
We're on our way back to Texas.
We'll drive cattle up to meet your railroad.

92
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,310
If we keep hanging around here,
these two galoots are gonna get civilized.

93
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:06,147
We better leave here before old fog head
starts eating with a knife and fork.

94
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,732
A knife, anyway.

95
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,734
You couldn't keep Wade here, Colonel.

96
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,986
He's the most moving-on man
you ever saw.

97
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,531
First off, he was in the English Army
over in lndia.

98
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,118
Then he got mixed up in some kind
of a hooray revolution down in Cuba way.

99
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:22,330
Then he started punching cattle in Texas.
That was before he enlisted in the war.

100
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,000
So he's either the greatest traveler
ever lived...

101
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,043
or else he is the biggest liar.

102
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,424
And now, it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you...

103
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:36,845
the man who made this progress possible:
Col. Dodge.

104
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,560
Ladies and gentlemen...

105
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,730
today a great chapter of history
has been written...

106
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,399
and we take justifiable pride...

107
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,362
in bringing this railroad to the terminal
furthest west in this country.

108
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,867
Someday, and I believe
it will be in the near future...

109
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,955
a great city will spring from this very spot
upon which we now stand.

110
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:08,043
A city which will represent
all that the West stands for:

111
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,255
honesty, courage, morality, and culture.

112
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,383
For all the noble virtues of civilization.

113
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,555
I can see a great metropolis of homes,
churches, schools.

114
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:26,061
A fine, decent city, which will become
the flower of the prairie.

115
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,984
A city whose name....

116
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:41,034
Yeah, Colonel. Just what do you aim
to call this here perfect metropolis?

117
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,913
What are we going to call it?

118
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,500
Why not call it after the man
who made it possible? Dodge City.

119
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,127
That's right. Dodge City it is.

120
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,589
Be sure to give those cattle plenty of salt.

121
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,133
The more water, the more weight.

122
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,224
Cattle is sure some business.

123
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,978
They must come to Dodge City
from all over the world, don't they, Pop?

124
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,189
Almost, son. Hold my horse.

125
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:46,368
Wait, Surrett. You can't ship those cattle.
Where's my money?

126
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,620
You'll get it, Cole.
Why don't you stop worrying?

127
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,164
You've got no right to ship those cattle
until I'm paid.

128
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,709
$15,000 dollars, cash in hand.
Those were the terms we agreed on.

129
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,463
Take it easy. I can't be running to the bank
every time a train leaves town.

130
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,882
If you don't trust me,
other cattle brokers will.

131
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,550
Maybe they used to, Surrett...

132
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,054
but not since what happened
to Sam Chapin and Kit Sproull.

133
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,057
They trusted you, too, didn't they?
But not me.

134
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,102
I'm coming to your place tonight
to collect for these steers.

135
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,855
You have the money waiting for me,
or I'm slapping a warrant on you.

136
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,073
You gotta get what's yours
when dealing with men like that.

137
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,408
They're no good.

138
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,536
Sure, Pop, but we can handle them.

139
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,380
Hold my horse, son.
I won't be but a minute.

140
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,591
Take your time, Pop,
but get all that's coming to us.

141
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,387
-Come along, boys, this is the place.
-Here's the Texan!

142
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,415
You look great tonight, Ruby.
I sure like that new dress.

143
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,875
-Thanks, darling.
-Just for luck.

144
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,335
You don't need any more luck.

145
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,004
That's right, I don't,
not as long as I've got you.

146
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,422
That's me.

147
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,523
-Hello, Surrett, I was looking for you.
-Hello, Matt.

148
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,691
You ready to see me?

149
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,360
-I was on my way up to get your money.
-I'll go with you.

150
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,946
Mind waiting a few minutes?
I got some business first.

151
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,365
I don't mind.
But don't try and run out on me.

152
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,200
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

153
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,577
Don't worry. I'm gonna
take care of you in a minute.

154
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,496
Come on over and wet your whistle.

155
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,623
-Hey, Jack.
-Yes, sir?

156
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,042
Give Mr. Cole anything he wants,
on the house.

157
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,877
Yes, sir. What'll it be, Mr. Cole?

158
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,046
-A glass of beer, please.
-Yes, sir.

159
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,182
Nice-looking bunch of steers
we shipped today, Cole.

160
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,893
Yeah. They'd look a lot better
if I'd been paid for them.

161
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,854
What do you mean?
Haven't we always paid?

162
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,397
Not from what I've heard.

163
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,733
Maybe you've been listening
to too much talk.

164
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,152
Maybe. Maybe not.

165
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,279
Are you calling me a liar?

166
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,783
I'm not calling you anything, Yancey.
In fact, I'd rather not talk to you at all.

167
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,119
-Keep your hand off that gun!
-Why, l--

168
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,842
"...in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection of the dead.

169
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,387
"Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

170
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:38,475
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
as in heaven, so in earth.

171
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,562
"Give us day by day our daily bread,
and forgive us our debts...

172
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,690
"as we also forgive everyone
that is indebted to us.

173
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,861
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen."

174
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,462
To have him go this way.

175
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,549
It's so cruel, so useless.

176
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,095
You promised you wouldn't cry, Mom.

177
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,690
John, will you look after Mrs. Cole?

178
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,818
You don't have to, Mr. Orth.
I can take care of her.

179
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,946
That's right, Harry.
You're the man of the family now.

180
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,741
Funeral's over.

181
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,202
There's your man, Marshal.
Serve your warrant.

182
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,414
It's about time those guerrillas
were taken in hand.

183
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,624
What are you waiting for? Go on.

184
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,836
Don't push me. I know my duties.

185
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,717
Hello, Marshal.

186
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,138
Yancey, I've got a warrant here
to arrest you for the murder of...

187
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,473
Matt Cole.

188
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,436
Why don't you go ahead and serve it?
What are you waiting for?

189
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,272
-Mind riding back into town with me?
-Yeah.

190
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,026
That's all right, Yancey.
You go ahead and ride in with the Marshal.

191
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,282
Why, sure, Marshal. Come along.

192
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,286
Come on, boys. Come on, Al.
After all, the law's the law.

193
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,079
Now, just a minute, Marshal.

194
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,081
-This is your--
-Now, hold on there, boys.

195
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:28,209
-Wait a minute.
-Get him in there, boys. Hurry up.

196
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,633
Come on, boys.
We'll ride him out of town in style.

197
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,068
What's the use of trying to make
an honest town of Dodge City?

198
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,029
Surrett's crowd scares off the honest,
law-abiding settlers.

199
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,782
They're all going on to Wichita
and Kansas City.

200
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,410
I tell you, Ellen,
we're the public disgrace of America.

201
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,622
You know what the New York newspapers
are saying?

202
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:10,585
There's no law west of Chicago,
and west of Dodge City, no God.

203
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,712
I'm afraid they're not far wrong.

204
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,174
It's becoming unsafe for a woman to walk
on the streets in this town.

205
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,717
And as for children....

206
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,887
I almost wish Lee and Abbie
weren't coming to live with us.

207
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,766
They'll be all right, unless
they're as bullheaded as their father was.

208
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,686
We haven't had a word from them
since they reached Texas.

209
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,979
When do you suppose
they're gonna get here?

210
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,898
I kept a record somewhere.

211
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,109
-I always used to--
-They're on the table.

212
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,443
Yeah, the dates.

213
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:39,572
They left Fort Worth three weeks ago
with a cattle-drive party.

214
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,157
Now, let's see.

215
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,705
Yeah, they must have crossed
the Red River about here...

216
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,542
then on up the Chisholm Trail
into the lndian territory.

217
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,963
I'd say they'd be about Broad Plain
by now.

218
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,365
Tex.

219
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,828
-Have you seen my brother?
-Yes'm.

220
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,372
He's over yonder somewhere
hotfooting it around.

221
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:33,001
He swiped one of the boss's horses
and I reckon he sure is drunk again.

222
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,378
I consider that a very impertinent remark.

223
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,423
Yes'm, I guess maybe I shouldn't have said
he's drunk...

224
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,091
even if he is drunk.

225
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,650
I don't know what I'm going to do
about you.

226
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,694
Broad Plain, huh?

227
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,657
This is where the lndians
are supposed to be?

228
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,743
Yes. If you keep up the fuss
you're making...

229
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,536
you'll have them right on our doorstep.

230
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,163
I wish they would attack us.

231
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,291
It's dull plugging along like this
day in and day out.

232
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,544
It's dull, but that's no reason
for you to act like a lunatic.

233
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:20,173
Maybe they don't even know we're here.
Let's tell them.

234
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,468
Stop it!

235
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,771
Was that you who fired those shots,
Mr. Irving?

236
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,232
-Sure it was him.
-Sure it was. What about it?

237
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,235
Nothing, except it seems like
a silly waste of ammunition.

238
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,987
He won't do it again. He was just bored.

239
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,907
Faith, now, that's a great shame.

240
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,910
-So am l.
-Really? Well, I'm sorry.

241
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,872
Perhaps things will get enlivened for you
if that shooting stampedes the cattle.

242
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,833
Since you seem to know
what troubles him...

243
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,002
I'd suggest you see he drinks less.

244
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,094
Them two youngsters is more trouble
than they're worth.

245
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:09,764
I'll certainly be glad to hand them over
to their uncle in Dodge.

246
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,475
She sure is pretty, though.

247
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,354
Yes. I'd still trade the two of them
for one good cigar.

248
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,617
All right, this is it! Tex! Rusty!

249
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,662
Tex, get the steers watered.

250
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,331
Rusty, line up the wagons
at the bottom of that slope.

251
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,959
-Get moving, flat neck.
-Hush, I'll get moving.

252
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,312
All right, folks, we're bedding down.

253
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,898
Watch your cook fires, now.
The grass is awful dry.

254
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,942
-Don't you wander off.
-Ma, I'm hungry.

255
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,719
All right, get your teams hooked up.
We're pulling out.

256
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,514
-Move as soon as you're ready.
-Tex, get the herd started.

257
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,599
Wade, you better watch
old bullet head here.

258
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,601
I caught him riding
in the wagon yesterday.

259
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,603
-Hush. I was--
-Hush up.

260
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,196
Good morning, Mrs. Harper.
Did you rest well?

261
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,156
-Thank you. Fine.
-Good.

262
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,997
Be sure you boil that water
before you drink it.

263
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,918
I'll bet two minutes after you were born,
you were telling the doctor what to do.

264
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,212
Think so? I'm sorry, Miss lrving.

265
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,339
You know, it's really no fun playing boss...

266
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,050
but someone's gotta say
what's to be done, haven't they?

267
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,552
You know, out here...

268
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,596
a trail boss has sometimes got to
take the law into his hands.

269
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,099
Yes. "Pioneering," I believe you call it,
don't you?

270
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,476
That's right.
You don't seem to be enjoying it much.

271
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,602
Enjoying it?

272
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,397
Can anyone enjoy being jolted along
week in and week out...

273
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,441
through a nightmare of heat and dust...

274
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,819
with sand in your teeth, eyes, and hair?

275
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,823
Faith, now. If you didn't like sand,
maybe you shouldn't have left home.

276
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,366
I wouldn't have.

277
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,619
But we didn't have much choice
after Father died.

278
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,913
I see. I'm sorry.

279
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,207
Here, can I take that?
It looks heavy for you.

280
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,084
No, thanks. I can manage it.

281
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,421
I'm sure you can manage a bigger one
in each hand, if you wanted to.

282
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:47,630
But why should you?

283
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,508
-Because I happen to be in a hurry.
-We'll wait for you.

284
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,177
There. See?

285
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,764
If everyone in the camp obeyed orders
as willingly and charmingly as that...

286
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,891
we wouldn't have any trouble at all.

287
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:01,603
My brother and I seem to be causing you
a great deal of trouble, Mr. Hatton.

288
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,563
No, just your brother.

289
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,901
You know, I think you spoil him
by mothering him, don't you?

290
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,319
Maybe I do.

291
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,572
May I make a suggestion?
Why don't you go--

292
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:25,960
Look here, Mr. Irving!
This ain't no picnic grounds.

293
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,047
Put up that gun
before you stampede them cattle.

294
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,257
Get down off your high horse,
will you, cowboy?

295
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:34,094
Watch me shoot the handle
right off of this one.

296
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,221
-Are you out of your mind?
-Hiya, Abbie.

297
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:40,183
You're just in time to witness
an exhibition of some real fancy shooting.

298
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,852
Put up that gun
before somebody takes it away from you.

299
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,354
Who's gonna take it away from me?

300
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,648
You're drunk,
you don't know what you're doing.

301
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,484
Don't start to lecture me.
I've had enough of that for now.

302
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,944
Lee, don't!

303
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,160
It's a run!

304
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,706
Tex, head in those leaders
and keep them milling.

305
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,291
See what you've done.
I hope you're satisfied.

306
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,169
I've been waiting to see some action
since this trip started.

307
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,422
You crazy galoot!
You saw what nearly happened.

308
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:14,009
What? Just gave you lazy cowhands
a little exercise, that's all.

309
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,811
Irving, you're giving us
a great deal of trouble.

310
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,522
-You're gonna force me to be unpleasant.
-Let me alone.

311
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,108
I'm not on your payroll,
and I'll do as I please.

312
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,818
No, you'll do as I please.

313
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,237
You people in the wagons
came to us for protection.

314
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,031
You paid for it, and you're getting it.

315
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,074
You'll obey orders
until we reach Dodge City.

316
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,368
You may not realize it,
but the Civil War is over...

317
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,662
and you're no longer
in the Army, Mr. Hatton.

318
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,164
I'm not gonna argue with you.

319
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,875
Sober up and stay sober,
or I'll confiscate your liquor.

320
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,378
If you lay a hand inside our wagon,
I'll blow it off.

321
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,714
Look, lrving...

322
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,051
we've got a very special treatment
for bad little boys like you.

323
00:27:56,384 --> 00:28:00,013
You behave yourself or you'll ride
into Dodge City backwards on a mule.

324
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,765
You'll look very silly.

325
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,476
Now we're moving. You better get started.

326
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,729
-Lee, be sensible.
-Let me alone.

327
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,277
I can hardly wait to see you on that mule.
You sure will look funny.

328
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,280
Take that stupid grin off your face,
you big hyena.

329
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,994
Drop that gun, lrving! Drop it, I tell you!

330
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,423
You've killed him.

331
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:39,070
Here you are, Tex. That's for Dr. Irving.

332
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,864
Take the shortcut into Twin Forks.

333
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,825
Bear left from there.
It's three hours to Dodge. Understand?

334
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:44,993
Sure I do, Wade.

335
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:48,496
I tried to explain in it.
Tell him I'll call on him when we get there.

336
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,541
I sure hope that doctor
is more understanding than his niece.

337
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,668
-Good luck. Get going, Tex.
-Goodbye.

338
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,521
Miss lrving.

339
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,524
I know how you must feel about all this...

340
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:19,486
and I know how you must feel
about my part in it.

341
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,529
My shot was unavoidable.

342
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,699
I'd never have fired it
except to defend myself.

343
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:29,454
I've no words to tell you
how badly I feel about it all.

344
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,873
Will you leave me alone, please?

345
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,983
Well, so this is Dodge City, huh?

346
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,403
It sort of smells like Fort Worth, don't it?

347
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,446
That's not the city you smell. That's you.

348
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,033
We'd better get you to a bathtub
before somebody shoots you for a buffalo.

349
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:10,954
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?
Lady, can I carry your basket?

350
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,127
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?

351
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:21,256
Gentlemen, can I hold your horses?
I'll watch them real careful.

352
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:24,050
-What's the idea, sonny?
-I'm in business.

353
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,261
I'm the man of the family now.

354
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,431
You're certainly making an early start.
What do you charge?

355
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:32,058
A quarter just for keeping an eye
on your horses.

356
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,185
50 cents for watching them extra good.

357
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,397
All right, then.
We'll take $1 worth of the extra good.

358
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:39,566
Didn't Shakespeare begin
by holding horses?

359
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,068
-Who?
-Hey, stranger, where's the money?

360
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,863
So you don't get any credit here, either?

361
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,448
Here you are.

362
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,826
-Thanks, mister. Much obliged.
-You're welcome.

363
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,329
William Shakespeare.

364
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:56,041
I never heard of him.
What part of Texas is he from?

365
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,375
Stratford-on-Avon.

366
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,918
-Good morning, boys.
-Good morning.

367
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,546
-You fellows look pretty dusty.
-We certainly are.

368
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,466
It's on us about an inch thick
for each state in the country.

369
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:27,364
What's the news in Dodge?

370
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,240
Just about the same as always:

371
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,410
gambling, drinking, and killing.
Mostly killing.

372
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:37,165
Had one here just the other night.
Coldest-blooded thing I ever heard of.

373
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,793
Man named Yancey shot Matt Cole
over at the Gay Lady.

374
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,296
Matt Cole? I used to know him in Texas.
What was the trouble?

375
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,508
What was the trouble?
How long since you been in Dodge?

376
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,843
Quite some time.
We always ship up through Wichita.

377
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:52,055
This town is run
by a man named Jeff Surrett.

378
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,641
Cole was trying to collect
for some cattle he sold.

379
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,851
$15,000, Surrett owed him.

380
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,524
Good morning, gentlemen.

381
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,443
How long before you'll be through
with this fellow?

382
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,449
In about 10 minutes, Mr. Surrett.

383
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,953
All right, hurry it up.
I'm gonna take a bath. Yancey.

384
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:18,707
I'm sorry,
there's somebody in there already.

385
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,637
Hey, shut that door!
There's a draft in here.

386
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,181
What's the idea, Charlie?

387
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,559
You know I always take a bath
on Saturday mornings.

388
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,893
Get that fellow out of there.

389
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:43,648
I'm sorry, I can't do that, Mr. Surrett.
He ain't been in there half an hour.

390
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:47,736
He's been in there long enough.
You tell him to get his clothes on.

391
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,362
All right.

392
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,740
-Wait a minute.
-What did you say?

393
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,868
My friend in there paid for that tub.

394
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,663
Much as you undoubtedly need a wash,
he needs it even more.

395
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,209
If it ain't our old friend Hatton.

396
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,920
Right. Quite a coincidence, isn't it?

397
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,384
You figuring on
being around Dodge City long?

398
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:14,304
No, just as long as it takes me
to finish my job.

399
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,140
Maybe longer, if I find it interesting.
Any objections?

400
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,684
No, I think we can make it
pretty interesting for you.

401
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,353
Yes, I'm sure you might.

402
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:25,523
I hear you made it pretty interesting
for Matt Cole the other night.

403
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,652
You always did hear a little too much.

404
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:33,031
It's possible you boys
were always a little too noisy.

405
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,668
Come on there, Charlie. Finish me up.

406
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:48,296
Put some of that green stuff on.
Make me smell like a geranium.

407
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,674
-Say, Wade.
-What?

408
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,176
You know, it just come to me
who that fellow was.

409
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,969
It did? Marvelous.

410
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,808
Naturally, our nephew's death
was a great blow to us.

411
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,687
But now, since your explanation,
I can understand how it happened.

412
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,398
There's no sense
in holding any grudge against you.

413
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,482
Thank you, sir.

414
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,777
We're used to death here in Dodge City,
Mr. Hatton.

415
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,613
Even of the people we love.

416
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:16,282
That's hard to say, but it's true.

417
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,034
Yes, I suppose so.

418
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,454
Thanks again, Doctor.

419
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:25,250
I wonder if I might pay my respects
to Mrs. and Miss lrving on my way out?

420
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,210
No, my boy. I wouldn't advise that.

421
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,505
Walter, Mr. Evans wants you to come
as soon as you can.

422
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:33,133
-Excuse me.
-Ellen, this is Mr. Hatton.

423
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:37,053
-How do you do, Mrs. Irving?
-He's come to tell us about Lee.

424
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:42,892
It's regrettable that we have to meet
under these circumstances, Mrs. Irving.

425
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,981
I'm sorry, my boy.

426
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,567
But, you see, we never had
any children of our own.

427
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,360
And to my wife, Lee was....

428
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:55,196
Well, you can understand
how she feels about it.

429
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,489
Yes, of course.

430
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,617
Anyhow, it was very gracious of you
to receive me, sir.

431
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,371
Don't bother about that thing, sir. I can....

432
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:04,873
Miss lrving.

433
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:09,294
I'll not be troubling you
with any further apologies.

434
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:13,131
But I would like you to know that
if ever I can be of any service to you...

435
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,508
-I shall be only too happy.
-Thank you.

436
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:19,763
The only way you can be of service to me
is to keep out of my sight.

437
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:24,559
I wouldn't take that too seriously, my boy.

438
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,937
Women's logic and emotions
are often very confusing.

439
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,857
I think I've heard my father say
the same thing.

440
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,276
I'm sure that Miss Abbie
has a more biting tongue...

441
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,070
than my mother ever had.

442
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,324
All right, gentlemen,
let's begin the auction.

443
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:42,577
One thousand six hundred and nineteen
head of prime Texas steer.

444
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,455
Grass-fed, fat, frisky,
fresh off the Chisholm Trail.

445
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:46,748
Is that correct, sir?

446
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,167
Go ahead.
But don't make any sale until I tell you.

447
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,462
Right. The agent reserves his right
to refuse all bids.

448
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,632
Now then, who'll start us off?
What am I offered?

449
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:56,841
$25 a head.

450
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,260
$25 from Mr. Surrett. I'm going to $28.

451
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,263
$28 for the finest herd of steers
that ever come out of Texas.

452
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:05,266
-Who'll say $28? Mr. Cagle?
-No, sir.

453
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:06,601
Mr. Orth?

454
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,771
Here's a cash profit of $50,000
begging to be picked up.

455
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,439
-All right, $28.
-Thank you, sir.

456
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:14,150
$28 is bid. Who'll say $30?

457
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,569
-Nobody will raise it?
-$30.

458
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:21,074
$30 from Mr. Surrett.
Anybody raise that? Anybody say $32?

459
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,035
How about you, Mr. Orth?

460
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,957
Going to Mr. Surrett for $30.
Once. Going twice.

461
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:30,458
Hold on.

462
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:34,087
Will Mr. Surrett and Mr. Orth
be kind enough to step up here?

463
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:38,633
Mr. Surrett, Mr. Orth,
will you come over here, please?

464
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,472
You offered $30. Was that cash?

465
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:46,599
What's that to you?
Do you own those cattle?

466
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,477
I'm the agent for them.
I'm protecting the owner's interest.

467
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:50,770
I see.

468
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,482
I'll give you part of it in cash tonight
and the balance in 30 days.

469
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,609
I see. How about you, sir?

470
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,571
I could've paid the full amount
in cash today.

471
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,198
-You could have? Right. They're yours.
-Mine?

472
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,783
-But he offered--
-I said, sold.

473
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,953
What are you trying to do?
I made the high bid on those steers.

474
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:10,081
I heard you. But I prefer to make my deal
with cash buyers...

475
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,834
who don't pay off
in the back rooms of saloons.

476
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:15,128
I'm at the Drovers Hotel, Mr. Orth.

477
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:18,340
If you care to meet me at 3:00
in Room 15, we can close this deal.

478
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:19,841
-I'll be there.
-Right.

479
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:22,510
Deal is made, Mr. Auctioneer.
Thanks. Good day.

480
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:24,179
Sold to Mr. Orth.

481
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:27,307
-Joe, did you hear that?
-I'll put it right on the front page.

482
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,017
-Who's that fellow?
-I don't know.

483
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,269
But you can bet I'm gonna find out.

484
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,568
-How are you, Harry?
-Hello, Mr. Orth.

485
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:40,862
-I'll hold your horse for you.
-Good.

486
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:44,366
-For a quarter.
-Well, that's fair enough.

487
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:45,950
-Here.
-Thanks.

488
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,204
How are you, Frank?

489
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:51,331
-Fine. How are you, Mr. Orth?
-Just fine.

490
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:52,999
-Howdy, Mr. Orth.
-Howdy.

491
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,007
Stick 'em up.

492
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,051
Rusty, we're done for.

493
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:06,721
It's Dangerous Ambrose, the terror
of the prairie. He's got us in his power.

494
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:09,641
Yes, sir. I'm a pretty desperate character.

495
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,059
I can see that.

496
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,269
Would you take ransom
if we offered it to you?

497
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:14,896
Try it and see.

498
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,234
How's that?

499
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,568
Thanks, mister.

500
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:24,239
I'll watch your horses better
than they were ever watched before.

501
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,199
That's fair enough.

502
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,494
I sure hope you stay in town a long time.

503
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:31,538
I'll bet you do at that.

504
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,418
Mr. Orth come in yet?

505
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:39,087
He went upstairs a few minutes ago,
Mr. Hatton.

506
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,423
My name is Joe Clemens.
I'm editor of the Star.

507
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:45,343
I'd like to publish your impressions
of Dodge City, if you don't mind.

508
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:53,351
Jack Orth. Somebody shot him.
He's laying right outside of Room 15.

509
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:12,662
That's too bad, Hatton.

510
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:16,041
I don't think your deal with Orth
will go through.

511
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:19,627
But I'm still offering you $30 a head
for those cattle.

512
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:25,258
Listen, Surrett. Those cattle
aren't for sale to you at any price.

513
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,308
It's a shame about Jack Orth being killed,
isn't it?

514
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,643
Must have been a big surprise to you.

515
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,605
Excuse me.

516
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:44,027
Another murder. Four or five a day.

517
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,488
Surrett's getting to be
the undertaker's best friend.

518
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,782
It's sure getting dangerous
to live around here.

519
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:50,658
Why don't you get out?

520
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:12,305
Clemens, I see by that bulletin
that you're looking for trouble again.

521
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,933
What's the matter?
We're just printing the plain facts.

522
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:18,478
We've put up with you and your paper
long enough. Now we mean business.

523
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:21,564
Yancey, you're not scared
of that fellow from Texas, are you?

524
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:22,857
We'll take care of him.

525
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:26,945
But I'm warning you, don't print
no story about Surrett. Is that clear?

526
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:29,781
I'm waiting for an answer.

527
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:37,163
I reckon you get the general idea now.

528
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:44,629
Rusty, I don't like
the look of those clothes.

529
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,256
They look like you're up to no good.

530
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:50,635
I ain't had store clothes on for a long time.
I kind of felt like I wanted to clean up.

531
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,221
I got a call to make down here,
so you're on your own.

532
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:56,057
Just try and keep sober
and stay out of trouble.

533
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,977
You know I signed the temperance pledge
before we left Texas.

534
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,022
Sure, I know that.
You were blind drunk when you signed it.

535
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,066
No, you're confusing the issue.
I'm a reformed man.

536
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,778
Even a reformed man can get into trouble
when the boys get paid off.

537
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,572
No, I ain't gonna touch a drop.

538
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,866
I'm just gonna mosey around
and take in the sights.

539
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:14,576
Look out you don't become one of them.

540
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:16,494
Wade, don't you worry none about it.

541
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,788
You don't think
after me getting store clothes...

542
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,624
that I'll have anything like that
happen to me, do you?

543
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,761
Hey, mister.

544
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,976
Please help me over, will you, young man?

545
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,857
Come closer.

546
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:02,415
There you are, ma'am. Glad to be of help.

547
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:36,199
-Hi, Rusty. Come on, have a drink.
-Hi, Rusty.

548
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:38,159
Come with us and get your feet wet.

549
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,912
-Sorry, Tex. I'm just leaving.
-What do you mean, leaving?

550
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:44,082
We got a lot of Kansas dust to wash down.
Come on.

551
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:48,920
Waste my pay on liquor and gambling?
Not me, boys. I'm on the pledge.

552
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:51,339
You ain't serious, Rusty?

553
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,509
I tell you, boys, I've saw the light.

554
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:58,388
I'm through with your sinful ways
and your riotous living.

555
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:01,057
He must be crazy with the heat.

556
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,568
Hey, you old walrus, you!

557
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:18,450
I don't want that. Give me one of those.

558
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,285
That's more like it.

559
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,936
My gracious!

560
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:51,149
Howdy, young man.
Are you a stranger in town?

561
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:54,277
Yes, ma'am. But I sure didn't know
this was just for women folks.

562
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:57,572
But it isn't. Not at all.
We're mighty glad to have you.

563
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:01,910
But first of all, let me introduce
our beloved president, Mrs. McCoy.

564
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:05,914
So delighted to meet you
in this charitable institution.

565
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,959
Ma'am, my name is Hart. Algernon Hart.

566
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:11,961
Mr. Algernon Hart.

567
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:15,382
Well, Mr. Hart,
you're just in time for the meeting.

568
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:18,843
But first, come and have a cup of tea,
Mr. Harvey.

569
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:20,220
Hart, ma'am.

570
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,890
I'm so sorry. Mr. Hart.
Come, girls. Help me.

571
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:28,103
Now, here's your tea. I hope you like it.

572
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:31,106
-One or two?
-Three, ma'am.

573
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:33,942
Are you married?

574
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:32,459
-Hey, Joe!
-Yeah?

575
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,461
How about that Dixie?

576
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,175
That's for the Fifth Kansas lnfantry.

577
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,886
He chased those fellows
so far from Fredericksburg...

578
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:27,222
they ain't stopped running yet.

579
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:31,101
Yeah? They must have stopped running
long enough to get their picture took.

580
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:33,144
Nobody ever chased
the Fifth Kansas, mister.

581
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,355
-Do you belong to it?
-All of us do.

582
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:36,981
So is that a fact?

583
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:40,151
You must have had to run a long way
to get back to Kansas.

584
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,904
Well, it's gonna be a longer run
back to Texas.

585
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:50,203
It's that dreadful saloon next door.

586
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:53,123
Mabel, please close the shutters.

587
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:56,501
I'm so sorry, Mr. Hart.

588
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:03,675
And there I was, a poor orphan,
no ma, no pa.

589
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,802
Brung up by Comanche lndians.

590
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:47,844
No matter where you go,
fighting ain't good.

591
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:49,512
It ain't no use to fight.

592
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,308
Fighting is a thing l....
I don't like it myself. And now I want--

593
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,484
That's a present from U. S. Grant.

594
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:06,279
That's for Robert E. Lee.

595
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:16,164
Yes, sir. And I want to say to you, sisters...

596
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:20,335
that when righteousness flows from the....

597
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,045
It was smooth.

598
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:45,151
Who's next?

599
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:06,548
Come get these fleas out of my hair.

600
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:17,100
Stop it, you fools! Stop it, I say! Stop it!

601
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,521
Thanks, Rusty. Just in time.

602
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:24,399
Stop it, you fools!

603
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:09,778
All right, boys. Looks like
we dusted this place out pretty good.

604
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:14,991
That's one fight you Yanks didn't win.

605
00:51:15,116 --> 00:51:17,494
But take it easy.
We'll send a veterinary right over.

606
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:18,953
Come on!

607
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:32,217
Somebody's gonna pay for this
and it ain't gonna be with money.

608
00:51:33,968 --> 00:51:38,223
When I seen the light,
it come to me sort of vision-like.

609
00:51:38,598 --> 00:51:39,808
And I was saved.

610
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:42,977
Hey, Jeff, there's one of them
Texas heroes left behind.

611
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:45,939
-Let me take a sock at him.
-No, I'll handle this.

612
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:56,783
You boys had a lot of fun, didn't you?

613
00:51:56,866 --> 00:51:58,868
-We sure did.
-That's fine.

614
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:02,122
I've been waiting a long time
for you and your pal to make a move...

615
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:05,000
-and this looks like it.
-What are you gonna do?

616
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:08,169
I'm gonna have some fun now
paying back an old debt with interest.

617
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:11,339
Come on, boys.
Let's take him out to the plaza.

618
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:26,688
Bring him along.

619
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:32,777
-Hey, Doc! Mr. Hatton!
-What's wrong, Joe?

620
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,696
Your men just wrecked
the Gay Lady saloon.

621
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:35,947
-Anybody hurt?
-I don't know.

622
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,574
They're gonna hang one of your boys.

623
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:39,909
-Where are the rest?
-They've ridden back to camp.

624
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:42,829
-Where's the hanging party?
-Right in the middle of the plaza.

625
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,716
You're plum loco.

626
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:57,719
-I ain't done nothing to be strung up for.
-Shut up.

627
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:08,438
Hold on, boys.

628
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,692
Be careful, Mr. Hatton. Take it easy.

629
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:23,828
That rope is strong enough
for both of them.

630
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:27,207
What do you think of that?

631
00:53:30,126 --> 00:53:32,170
I've no wish to spoil your fun, Surrett.

632
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:35,715
But would you be kind enough
to tell those men to let him go?

633
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:40,845
Sure. We'll let him go just as quick as
he gets through dancing around up there.

634
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:44,265
You heard what I said, I think.
Tell them to let him go.

635
00:53:44,307 --> 00:53:46,726
All right. String him up, boys.

636
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:49,771
Put 'em up! Stick 'em up!

637
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:53,942
Keep reaching high, boys,
or you know what happens to Surrett.

638
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:58,279
Get over here, Rusty. Get his gun.

639
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:03,201
We may never be this close again, Surrett.

640
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,955
I'm anxious to hear what the sheriff
has to say about this hanging.

641
00:54:06,996 --> 00:54:08,498
Start walking.

642
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:30,145
-What are you gonna do with him?
-No warrant for his arrest.

643
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:31,980
Did he have a warrant to hang this man?

644
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:34,149
You can't jail him without a sheriff's order.

645
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:36,484
That's where we're going.
To get a sheriff's order.

646
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:43,283
Wait a bit. What's this?
Where's the sheriff?

647
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,869
Somebody ran him out of town.

648
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,580
Mr. Surrett's the law in Dodge now.

649
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:50,874
I see.

650
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,253
Why don't you make him sheriff then?

651
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:57,881
Yeah. That's not a bad idea.

652
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:00,467
Why not?

653
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:04,763
And if I can be of any service to you gents,
just let me know.

654
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:13,313
That's the first jail I've ever seen
you couldn't get in.

655
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:15,482
Come on. Good day, gentlemen.

656
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:18,860
-lt was all a mistake.
-A mistake?

657
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,113
I thought you promised me
you weren't going to get into trouble.

658
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:24,657
Shucks, Wade, I really wasn't in trouble.

659
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:27,535
I see. You're the sort
who doesn't really get into trouble...

660
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:30,330
until they start nailing the lid down
on your coffin.

661
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:31,831
What's that?

662
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,757
"Pure Prairie League of Dodge City."

663
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,971
Wait till I tell Tex about this.

664
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,477
Don't tell Tex.

665
00:55:54,145 --> 00:55:56,106
Well, gentlemen, what's this all about?

666
00:55:56,189 --> 00:55:58,900
You all look as though you lost a dollar
and found a dime.

667
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:01,403
All right. Go ahead and tell him, Doctor.
Thank you.

668
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:05,198
Mr. Hatton, we've invited you here
this afternoon with a special purpose.

669
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,575
We want you to help us clean up our city.

670
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:10,995
Up to date, our police officers
have not been equal to the job.

671
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:13,581
They've either got killed
or run out of town.

672
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,583
Won't you take the job?

673
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:19,337
Gentlemen, I certainly appreciate
your confidence in me.

674
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:22,590
But I'm afraid a position like that
isn't quite in my line.

675
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,217
You're asking me to turn policeman.

676
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,138
I have about as much qualifications
for that as I have teaching the ballet.

677
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:30,974
You seemed to be well-qualified
the other day in the plaza.

678
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:33,518
I had to get that big hardhead
out of that somehow.

679
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:36,104
Any one of you
would have done the same. No.

680
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:39,899
We know what we're asking of you
and the chances you'd be taking.

681
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:44,612
But it's finally come to a showdown.
Who's gonna run Dodge: we or Surrett?

682
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:49,117
We're inviting peaceful emigration here,
family men with women and children.

683
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:52,120
And we meet them
with what's come to be called Hell Street.

684
00:56:52,203 --> 00:56:54,581
I can certainly appreciate
everything you say.

685
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:56,958
But as far as I'm concerned,
it can't be done.

686
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,170
I'm in the cattle business.
That demands all my time and attention.

687
00:57:00,253 --> 00:57:01,296
I'm sorry.

688
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,798
I wish you'd think it over, my boy.
We need you.

689
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,217
You're asking the wrong man,
Uncle Walter.

690
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:09,179
He isn't interested
in the lives of innocent people.

691
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:12,057
Why should he care what happens
to you and your families?

692
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,476
Your struggle to make a living
in a decent city?

693
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:17,437
What Dodge City needs is a man
with a sense of public pride...

694
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:20,982
and the courage to back it up
by shooting it out with men of equal skill.

695
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:24,402
But Mr. Hatton's bravery consists
of gunfights with impulsive boys.

696
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:25,987
Abbie, stop it.

697
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,621
Well, gentlemen,
I don't think much remains to be said.

698
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,001
Mrs. Irving, thank you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

699
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:50,845
Quickly as you can. Come along.

700
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,972
Harry, keep out of that lunch basket.

701
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:56,059
I can't seem to get my mind
off those pies, Miss Abbie.

702
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:59,104
-How long before we eat?
-Not till we get to Sycamore Springs.

703
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:01,481
-Come along.
-I'll do my best to wait.

704
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:10,031
Everybody in?

705
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:13,868
Here we go. Come along.

706
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:24,921
Cross the river here, Russ,
and bear due west on Wichita.

707
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:26,589
When are you fixing to get started?

708
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:29,509
First thing in the morning.
I'm sick of this town.

709
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:37,100
Good morning.

710
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:44,899
I know that man.

711
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:46,901
Hello, stranger.

712
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:49,195
Hello there, Shakespeare.

713
00:58:50,196 --> 00:58:52,282
-Here.
-Thanks.

714
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,164
You'd better watch that riverbed, too.
It's probably gonna be dry.

715
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,100
Steady!

716
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:26,733
I'll help you! Give me those reins.
Let me drive.

717
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:21,955
Let me through. Darling!

718
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,252
He was trying to help me.

719
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:29,254
Get a doctor, quick.

720
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:31,965
I'm afraid a doctor won't be any use.

721
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:34,801
Even children.

722
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:38,054
This has got to stop.

723
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:43,685
Oh, my darling. My little baby.

724
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:23,683
Go on.

725
01:01:41,117 --> 01:01:42,952
You're all under arrest.

726
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,579
Take them out, boys.

727
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:49,209
Get in there.

728
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:14,109
I wanted to be sure
you'd seen this, Surrett.

729
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:16,111
So I paid you a special visit.

730
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:17,696
I've already seen it.

731
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:20,740
It looks like you're trying
to run everybody out of Dodge City.

732
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:23,910
No, not everybody.
Just the undesirable element.

733
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:27,997
There's no law in Kansas
that prevents a man from carrying a gun...

734
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:31,626
-or coming or going where he pleases.
-There's going to be one.

735
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,545
Sit down, Hatton.

736
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,923
The merchants
are not gonna stand for this.

737
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:40,010
Yes, I think they will. The merchants
helped me draw this law up.

738
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:41,803
They're willing to take their chances.

739
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:44,014
I just wanted to be certain
about you, though.

740
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,850
-Let's get down to cases, Hatton.
-Right.

741
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:49,811
What cases?

742
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,813
You and I have had a couple of run-ins.

743
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,983
But I'll forget them if you do,
and see if we can't work together.

744
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:57,485
If you really mean that,
that'll make my job easier.

745
01:02:57,527 --> 01:03:00,155
-Your job is just what you make it.
-So I hear.

746
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:02,741
The last few sheriffs here
didn't do so well, did they?

747
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:05,910
They weren't your type. Just a bunch
of dumb sheep wearing badges.

748
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:07,746
I never even bothered to talk to them.

749
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:10,373
I'll bet if you had,
you'd have told them a thing or two.

750
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,834
Not what I'm gonna tell you anyway.

751
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,294
Now listen, Hatton.

752
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:17,172
There's no reason
that Dodge City can't be run properly.

753
01:03:17,255 --> 01:03:19,799
Just so long as you don't try
to change things too much.

754
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:22,469
Because this is a cattle town,
the biggest one on earth.

755
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:24,179
And that's what it's always gonna be.

756
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:26,765
There's more than $20 million worth
of beef and hides...

757
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:28,266
comes through here every year.

758
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,310
You know that because you bring them up.

759
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:32,479
You've been holding
the wrong end of the sack...

760
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:35,523
because the real money
ain't working for those Texas breeders.

761
01:03:35,565 --> 01:03:39,069
No, sir. It's right here in Dodge City
because this is where they pay off.

762
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:40,653
You mean, on your roulette tables.

763
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,322
Sure, coming and going.

764
01:03:42,405 --> 01:03:45,450
If not for the Gay Lady,
that money would go out of Dodge City...

765
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:48,328
and the trade would move right on
to Wichita.

766
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:49,954
You know that cattle crowd.

767
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,749
After months of backbreaking work
getting the cattle here...

768
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:54,709
they want a little fun and freedom.

769
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:57,045
If it's not here,
they'll go where they can get it.

770
01:03:57,128 --> 01:03:59,964
-And you'd go broke.
-Sure. But I ain't aiming to.

771
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:04,302
You see, I make $100,000 a year
one way or another.

772
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:06,471
Frankly, I don't need that much money.

773
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:09,015
Naturally, I'd be willing to make a deal
with anybody...

774
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:11,685
that would sort of see things my way.

775
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,896
Make a mighty good deal for both of us.

776
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:17,232
You mean, a little friendly bribery?

777
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:21,236
You can catch more flies with molasses
than you can with vinegar.

778
01:04:21,277 --> 01:04:24,572
True enough.
I hope you'll not be offended...

779
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:27,742
but I don't like the smell of your molasses.

780
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,795
You'd better get rid of that gun
by Monday. You're north of Front Street...

781
01:04:38,878 --> 01:04:41,631
and that jail's apt to be a little crowded.

782
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:48,221
What's the matter? Didn't it work?

783
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:51,224
He wouldn't listen to reason?

784
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:52,934
No, he wouldn't.

785
01:04:56,563 --> 01:04:59,190
All right, Russ, let's go. We've a lot to do.

786
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:05,488
Don't ever do nothing like that
unless I tell you to.

787
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:08,074
This ain't the time. We gotta wait a while.

788
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:12,245
They sure make a fella feel at home
around here.

789
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:15,415
Yes. They'll even dig you a home,
if you're nice to them.

790
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:21,254
One at a time here, fellas. Line up.

791
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:22,630
There you are.

792
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:26,259
-Will I get this stuff back again?
-You sure will.

793
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:30,930
-Disarm me? Not for no man.
-Nobody gets my gun.

794
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:35,143
-What a leery idea.
-Who does he think he is?

795
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:38,605
-Bet two.
-I'll call it.

796
01:05:38,688 --> 01:05:40,482
-Raise it five.
-Call five.

797
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:42,525
-I'm dead.
-Kings up.

798
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:46,279
-I guess we better quit, boys.
-Quitting because you're winning?

799
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:49,240
-You read that sign, didn't you?
-We don't believe in signs.

800
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:53,661
That sheriff's a big four-flusher and
that sign's been bad luck to me all night.

801
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,875
Guess that'll show you
Hatton ain't bluffing.

802
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,920
That's right, gentlemen.
Hatton's not bluffing.

803
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:03,838
-You're all under arrest.
-For what?

804
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:06,675
For not believing in signs.
All right, deputies, take them.

805
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:09,302
-Come on.
-Let go, now.

806
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:15,100
I tried to warn them, but I guess
they gotta learn through experience.

807
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:17,185
I don't know what
you're warning people about.

808
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:20,689
-What do you mean?
-You're north of Front Street, aren't you?

809
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:23,024
-And you're carrying a gun, aren't you?
-Yeah.

810
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:25,485
-Right. You're under arrest.
-What?

811
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:27,696
Come on.

812
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:30,699
But I'd feel undressed without my gun.

813
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,660
Where you're going, you won't need
any clothes for a few days.

814
01:06:33,743 --> 01:06:36,246
If I was you,
I'd rather arrest my brother than me.

815
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:38,623
Hey, Rusty, you are a traitor....

816
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:42,419
I'm sorry, boys,
I can't do anything about it.

817
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:46,047
Wade, you ain't gonna keep me in here,
are you?

818
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:48,717
Sorry, Tex. You read that notice
the same as anyone else.

819
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,885
Three days in there
won't do you a bit of harm.

820
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,847
You can't do this to me
after all we've been through together.

821
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:56,307
We fought the war together,
built the railroad...

822
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:59,269
we ate, drank, slept, lived,
and died together.

823
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:02,856
Now we're gonna be in jail together:
you in there and me out here.

824
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:49,527
Isn't that wonderful? That makes seven
families that have moved in this week.

825
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:51,529
That does my heart good.

826
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:54,282
There's the Turner family,
moving back from Wichita.

827
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:57,118
And after she said
she'd never set foot in Dodge again.

828
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:58,995
Welcome home, Mr. Turner!

829
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,539
-How do you do, Mr. Clemens?
-Hello, Joe.

830
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:05,669
Isn't that the sweetest bonnet
she's got on? It's brown moiré.

831
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:10,840
Moiré. How do you spell "moiré"?
M-O-l-R-E?

832
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:14,219
Who in tarnation gives a hoot
what Mrs. Turner's wearing?

833
01:08:14,302 --> 01:08:17,138
Just about every blessed woman in town,
that's all.

834
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:20,975
What happened in this fight
between the lndian and Jim Kendall?

835
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:24,145
I went into that pretty thorough.
There wasn't no fight.

836
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:27,607
They called each other names,
the lndian throwed a knife at Kendall.

837
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:30,652
Kendall sort of fired a couple of shots.
Nobody got hurt.

838
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:35,615
Nobody got.... I see. It wasn't a real fight,
it was just a sort of friendly argument.

839
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,659
-Hello, Tex.
-Hi, fellas.

840
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:39,661
Come on in and sit down.

841
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:42,664
What are you doing with
that secondhand store around your neck?

842
01:08:42,747 --> 01:08:44,833
Where've you been?
We ain't saw you for days.

843
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,669
Around. Been doing a lot of thinking lately.

844
01:08:47,794 --> 01:08:48,878
Thinking?

845
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,214
I hope you're gonna take that job
I offered you.

846
01:08:51,297 --> 01:08:53,008
We need another good deputy
around here.

847
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:56,469
That's what I've been thinking about.
I've decided to go back to Texas.

848
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:58,096
-What for?
-I don't know.

849
01:08:58,179 --> 01:09:01,057
This place is getting too big, and calm,
and peaceful-like.

850
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:03,601
You mean,
Rusty and I have stopped all the fun?

851
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:07,981
It's all right for women and children,
but I've decided to go back to Texas.

852
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:10,692
If you've made up your mind, that's that.

853
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:12,694
There's nothing we can do
to keep you here?

854
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:14,362
-No.
-So long, Tex.

855
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:17,866
-So long, Wade.
-Give him back his gun. Number 27.

856
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:21,494
If you're ever around here,
that job will still be waiting for you.

857
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:24,873
No, sir. I just don't fit
in a sissy town like this.

858
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,042
I certainly hate to see you go.

859
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:31,046
I'll miss you fellas, too, a lot.
We had a lot of fun together.

860
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:33,298
So long, knot head.

861
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:37,218
If I hung around here much longer,
I'd be riding a side saddle.

862
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,845
Yes, I suppose so.

863
01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:41,723
All right, Rusty. Arrest that man.

864
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:43,308
-Who? Me?
-What for?

865
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:45,560
He's carrying a gun, isn't he?

866
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:49,064
Give him back his old room.

867
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:06,289
-Morning, Joe.
-Hello, Wade. What's the news?

868
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,583
You ought to know.
Haven't you read your paper?

869
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,126
Got those tax notices ready?

870
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,836
-Hack's just running them off.
-Fine.

871
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,588
-Come on in.
-All right.

872
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:14,673
Have a chair.

873
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:17,217
You look as though you're pretty busy....

874
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:25,600
-Fred?
-Yes, ma'am.

875
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:29,521
-Would you set this in my copy, please?
-I will, ma'am.

876
01:10:30,438 --> 01:10:32,691
-Joe....
-Good morning.

877
01:10:34,192 --> 01:10:35,819
Did you want something?

878
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:39,739
I'd like to have my curiosity satisfied.
What are you doing here?

879
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:41,908
Obviously, I'm working.

880
01:10:42,283 --> 01:10:44,494
Obviously. But at what and why?

881
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:48,248
The town is growing by leaps and bounds,
and the paper needed somebody...

882
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:51,334
who would write things
that would interest its women readers.

883
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:55,964
I see. Tell me, what are the vital interests
of your women readers?

884
01:10:56,715 --> 01:10:58,258
What other women are wearing...

885
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:00,593
how to make Lady Baltimore cake
with two eggs...

886
01:11:00,635 --> 01:11:02,637
who invited the minister to tea...

887
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:05,265
and whose baby is going to be born
and when.

888
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:08,643
-Fascinating.
-ls there anything else you'd like to know?

889
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:10,979
What do the doctor and Mrs. Irving
think about it?

890
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:15,108
They made the same stupid objections
that you're making mentally now.

891
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:19,195
But when I decide on a thing,
I usually manage to carry it through.

892
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,947
Yes, I've noticed that.

893
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:24,576
You realize that people are inclined
to think that a newspaper office...

894
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:27,996
is an odd place for a charming lady
like you to be working, don't you?

895
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:30,165
Are you the delegation
sent to tell me that?

896
01:11:30,248 --> 01:11:31,291
No.

897
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,127
I stop trouble around here. I don't start it.

898
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,214
-What's wrong with my working here?
-It's undignified. It's unladylike.

899
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:41,676
You ought to be home doing needlework.
Things like that.

900
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,304
Sewing buttons on for some man,
I suppose.

901
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:46,681
Buttons come off.
Someone's gotta sew them on.

902
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,059
That's a fine career
for an intelligent woman.

903
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:51,353
-Here are your tax notices, Wade.
-Thanks.

904
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:54,814
There will be wailing
and gnashing of teeth when these go out.

905
01:11:54,856 --> 01:11:57,108
Abbie, I know this isn't in your line...

906
01:11:57,192 --> 01:11:59,277
but as long as you insisted on the job...

907
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:02,447
will you stop calling them
"cows in the stockyard"?

908
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:04,574
They're steers. Steers.

909
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:06,951
I don't see any difference.

910
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:10,747
"A rise is expected this season
in the price of longhorn cows."

911
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,667
Never mind. I'll correct this copy myself.

912
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:16,920
"Longhorn cows." I must be running along.

913
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:19,589
By the way,
may I let you into a little secret?

914
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:20,799
What?

915
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,760
You've got a smudge of ink on your nose.

916
01:12:24,594 --> 01:12:26,388
Goodbye. Goodbye, Joe.

917
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:27,722
Goodbye, Wade--

918
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:30,392
I'm sorry. Abbie.

919
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,187
Is this showing proper respect for the law?

920
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:36,940
I never saw the law fall on its face before.

921
01:12:37,023 --> 01:12:38,441
I didn't fall on my face.

922
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,985
There's an old saying in the British Army:

923
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:44,030
"The law must always save its face
in front of the natives."

924
01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:46,658
And what if the natives object to its face?

925
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:49,077
We just put them across our knee...

926
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,662
and spank them soundly.

927
01:12:50,745 --> 01:12:52,580
You're not suggesting that I'm a native?

928
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:55,625
No. The only real native of Kansas
is the buffalo.

929
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:58,211
He's got a very hard head,
a very uncertain temper...

930
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,296
and a very lonely future.

931
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:03,967
Apart from that, there's hardly
any comparison between you.

932
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,137
-Goodbye, Joe.
-Goodbye, Wade.

933
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:09,806
Goodbye.

934
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:13,935
I like that fella.

935
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:19,357
"Cows in the stockyard."

936
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,902
Of course, I ain't a man
who believes in taxes.

937
01:13:22,944 --> 01:13:25,071
But I can see they're a necessary evil.

938
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:28,408
Somebody's gotta pay for schools
and churches and such things.

939
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,411
Especially now that
the town's getting so darn big.

940
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,038
Yes, sir.

941
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:36,082
They do say there's nothing certain
except taxes and death.

942
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,500
Get up, Hatton.

943
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:41,379
What for?

944
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:45,216
A couple of the boys are waiting outside
to have a little talk with you.

945
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,259
I see.

946
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:49,971
You know, I'm really surprised at Surrett.

947
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:54,476
I thought he had more intelligence than
to send you here on a silly deal like this.

948
01:13:54,809 --> 01:13:58,229
-You haven't got a chance--
-Shut up and get out of that chair quick.

949
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:07,030
About 10 days for this customer.
Five to cool off and five to think it over.

950
01:14:07,113 --> 01:14:08,990
You bet. I'll take care of it personally.

951
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:11,618
Come on, sonny boy.
I'll buy you some candy.

952
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:21,211
-What were you saying about taxes?
-What taxes?

953
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:25,256
I don't remember.
Shall I trim your mustache?

954
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,677
No, thanks. I think I can manage.

955
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:47,320
See that big herd of buffalo
grazing away so peacefully down there?

956
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:57,247
The trouble with the buffalo is
they had things too easy at the start.

957
01:14:57,706 --> 01:15:00,333
It works the other way around, too.
Take us, for example.

958
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:03,378
We had such a bad beginning.
We'll have a wonderful future.

959
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,964
That's typical lrish logic:
totally unconnected.

960
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:07,424
You think so?

961
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:11,386
It may be lrish, but it's not unconnected,
and I can prove it.

962
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,723
Thirty years ago, my father met
my mother at the Londonderry fair.

963
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:18,685
He'd come down to sell some prize pigs.
Big, fat, lovely pigs they were.

964
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:21,896
Mother was down there
after winning the grand prize for her roses.

965
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:26,484
Roses of Sharon, enormous, big things,
as big as your face and nearly as beautiful.

966
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:31,072
I don't suppose there were ever roses
like that in the whole of lreland.

967
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:34,701
What must happen?
The very last day of the fair...

968
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:38,830
Father's pigs get out and eat up
every single one of Mother's prize roses.

969
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:40,790
Root, stem, flower and all.

970
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:46,838
Did any two people ever get off
to a worse start than that?

971
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:51,343
Look at them now: six big lusty sons,
a score or so of prize pigs...

972
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:54,637
and the most beautiful rose garden
in the whole of Antrim.

973
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:58,975
I envy you people
who have kissed the Blarney Stone.

974
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,560
You do?

975
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:02,771
It's cold on the lips.

976
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:08,193
I think we'd better be getting back.

977
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:10,320
I'm afraid it'll be dark before we get there.

978
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:13,573
-Are you sure it's the dark you're afraid of?
-What do you mean?

979
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:17,202
-Maybe you're afraid I might kiss you.
-You wouldn't dare.

980
01:16:18,244 --> 01:16:20,705
I wish I were as sure of that as you are.

981
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:29,964
May l?

982
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:31,800
Thank you.

983
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:38,556
You know, I was just thinking...

984
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:44,562
the buffalo wouldn't be so badly off if
the buffalo didn't have a one-track mind.

985
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:47,148
But then the buffalo wouldn't be a buffalo,
would it?

986
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:48,733
I suppose not.

987
01:16:48,983 --> 01:16:52,612
You wouldn't be you unless you thought
you might like that kiss.

988
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:55,281
-You seem very sure of my reactions.
-Oh, no.

989
01:16:56,324 --> 01:16:59,994
That's something you can
never be sure about until you've tried it.

990
01:17:02,163 --> 01:17:03,289
Can you?

991
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:23,518
Good morning, Abbie.

992
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:25,895
Good morning, Mrs. Cole. How are you?

993
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:27,355
So-so.

994
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:31,192
Won't you come in and sit down?

995
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:35,030
There. Is there anything I can do for you?

996
01:17:35,071 --> 01:17:37,866
Yes, I'd like to run this advertisement
in your paper.

997
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:40,201
That is, if it doesn't cost too much money.

998
01:17:40,243 --> 01:17:44,039
Our advertising rates are very low.
I'm sure we'll be able to.

999
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:46,207
You want to sell your house?

1000
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:48,668
No, I don't want to. I have to, Abbie.

1001
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:53,006
Let's get a new lead line
on this church bazaar story.

1002
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:55,091
How do, Mrs. Cole? How are you today?

1003
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:58,178
-Good morning, Joe.
-How much will you charge on this?

1004
01:17:58,303 --> 01:18:00,263
One, two, three, four....

1005
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:04,059
You're selling your house?
You're not leaving town, are you?

1006
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:07,270
No, I just....
Joe, I can't afford to keep it up.

1007
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:10,065
I can't even begin to meet
the taxes on it these days.

1008
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:13,401
I can't understand that.
Matt always made good money.

1009
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:15,737
Just the day he died...

1010
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:19,491
he collected $15,000 from Surrett.
Didn't he?

1011
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:23,328
That's what I thought, too,
but I've never seen a penny of it.

1012
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:26,039
Well, what have you done about it?

1013
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:28,708
I've spoken to Jeff Surrett about it
several times...

1014
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,252
but he'll never give me a straight answer.

1015
01:18:32,754 --> 01:18:36,466
It looks to me like Mrs. Cole needs help,
and we might be able to help her.

1016
01:18:36,549 --> 01:18:38,385
Yeah, it does look that way.

1017
01:18:38,593 --> 01:18:41,763
Mrs. Cole, would you mind
if we kind of looked into this?

1018
01:18:41,846 --> 01:18:45,725
Mind? I'd consider it a very great favor.

1019
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:50,188
There are a lot of accounts in this town
to be settled. Now, let's see.

1020
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,108
How's the best way to tackle this?

1021
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:57,237
There you are. The entry, the date,
and the figures. $15,000.

1022
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,657
What Matt Cole did with his money
after that is his business, not mine.

1023
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:03,952
He had $10 on his body when he
was found. He never left the saloon.

1024
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:06,955
I make it a point not to discuss
the affairs of my customers.

1025
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:09,791
But as long as you force my hand,
I'll give you the facts.

1026
01:19:09,874 --> 01:19:12,544
Matt Cole lost that $15,000
playing roulette.

1027
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:15,380
Playing roulette?
I'd like you to remember that, Abbie.

1028
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:17,215
Don't worry, I'll remember.

1029
01:19:17,298 --> 01:19:21,386
As a matter of fact, we'll all remember it.
He never went near those roulette tables.

1030
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:24,055
He went straight to the bar
and Yancey killed him there.

1031
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:26,599
-According to who?
-You'll find that out in court.

1032
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:29,728
If you've got such a clear case,
why don't you arrest me now?

1033
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:31,563
I think we'll wait a few days.

1034
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:33,440
I want to talk to a few more people...

1035
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:36,735
before we start giving you board and room
at the state's expense.

1036
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:38,278
You're bluffing, Hatton.

1037
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:40,530
You're holding a pair of deuces.
You're bluffing.

1038
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:41,740
Am l?

1039
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:44,617
Munger killed Orth
because he spoiled a cattle deal for you.

1040
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:48,121
Yancey killed Cole because he tried
to collect $15,000 you owed him.

1041
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:51,958
And more citizens in this town have
been killed trying to do business with you.

1042
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,586
That's what the three of us
are going to prove in court.

1043
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:57,172
We'll see if the jury thinks we're bluffing.

1044
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,549
Take that book, Joe.
I want to look at it again.

1045
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:02,344
I can hardly wait
to start writing this story.

1046
01:20:02,385 --> 01:20:05,722
Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
the most important article...

1047
01:20:05,805 --> 01:20:08,391
that's ever appeared in
the Dodge City Star.

1048
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:16,983
There it is. We'll have it out
by noon tomorrow.

1049
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:20,445
How did you find out
all these other things about Surrett?

1050
01:20:20,528 --> 01:20:23,031
Abbie, a good newspaperman
has two jobs.

1051
01:20:23,114 --> 01:20:25,700
One is to write the news as it happens,
day by day.

1052
01:20:25,784 --> 01:20:28,828
The other is to be ready for it,
and write it first...

1053
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,538
all but the end.

1054
01:20:30,955 --> 01:20:33,083
This is Jeff Surrett's morgue.

1055
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:35,710
I must be an optimist at heart.

1056
01:20:35,752 --> 01:20:38,296
I've been getting it ready for a long time.

1057
01:20:39,422 --> 01:20:43,009
You two, haven't you got any homes
to go to? It's past midnight.

1058
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:46,388
You'd better be running along, Abbie.
The Doc will skin me alive.

1059
01:20:46,429 --> 01:20:48,515
We've got Surrett
by the scruff of the neck.

1060
01:20:48,598 --> 01:20:52,227
You have? Why not let it go tonight
and resume your grip in the morning?

1061
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:55,522
You two realize what kind of a target
you'd make from out there?

1062
01:20:55,563 --> 01:20:59,025
I'm gonna take you home before
your uncle gets after Joe with a shotgun.

1063
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:02,195
Here's your cloak.
I'll come back and stay till you finish, Joe.

1064
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:05,240
The story's all written.
You don't have to worry about me.

1065
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:08,993
I'm just gonna mark it for the printer,
then call it a day. Italics.

1066
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:12,205
Don't hang around, or Surrett
might come in and mark it for you.

1067
01:21:12,288 --> 01:21:14,708
They wouldn't try anything
at this stage of the game.

1068
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:16,501
You think not? I hope you're right.

1069
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:18,420
Good night, Abbie.
See you in the morning.

1070
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:20,088
-Good night, Joe.
-Good night, Wade.

1071
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:22,048
Lock this door after us when we go out.

1072
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:25,093
Mr. Hatton, I am accustomed
to being up after dark.

1073
01:21:25,176 --> 01:21:27,345
-Lock it.
-All right.

1074
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,514
-Good night.
-Good night.

1075
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:34,144
"The laws of Dodge City
must be respected...

1076
01:21:34,227 --> 01:21:36,354
"not only by one group of citizens...

1077
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:39,941
"but by all groups." Paragraph. I like that.

1078
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,585
What was that?

1079
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:13,058
Whoever killed Joe Clemens
ought to be strung up.

1080
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:15,268
And, by golly, I'll furnish the rope.

1081
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,520
If he's got enough neck left
to put a rope on.

1082
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:20,815
They sneaked up on him.
Never even gave him a chance.

1083
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:26,905
The bullet went through his heart.

1084
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:30,075
I can only blame myself for this.

1085
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,911
But it's one thing
they won't get away with.

1086
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:36,831
Little fella sure was aces. It's too bad.

1087
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,627
I can't understand it.

1088
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:45,215
Everybody knows that Joe didn't have
any enemies except Surrett and his gang.

1089
01:22:45,298 --> 01:22:47,217
Who else could have done it?

1090
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,680
Isn't it sufficient proof that Joe's story
is gone and the whole file on Surrett?

1091
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:55,600
This door was locked.
I know that because I tried it myself.

1092
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:58,520
It's an old lock. Any key will fit it.

1093
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:06,653
-There's nothing here. You're sure?
-He always left his copy here on top...

1094
01:23:06,736 --> 01:23:08,905
so we could set it up
first thing in the morning.

1095
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:13,201
I'm sorry, Sheriff, that's printer's ink.
You can't wash it. It has to wear off.

1096
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,043
Did you ever read the contents
of Joe's files on Surrett?

1097
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:25,213
I certainly did,
and there was enough in it to hang him.

1098
01:23:25,338 --> 01:23:27,632
Keep that to yourself.
I think you ought to go now.

1099
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:29,801
You're looking tired. Good night.

1100
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:33,304
See the doctor and Miss lrving home,
will you?

1101
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:34,556
Right.

1102
01:23:38,351 --> 01:23:41,980
-What's the next move, Wade?
-I suppose we're going to....

1103
01:23:43,356 --> 01:23:45,608
Are you sure he isn't in his office upstairs?

1104
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,653
I tell you, Surrett left town
on the 4:30 train this afternoon.

1105
01:23:48,737 --> 01:23:51,489
If you don't believe us,
go ask the station agent.

1106
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:54,242
Jeff was halfway to Wichita
when the shooting occurred.

1107
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:56,828
You're barking up the wrong tree, mister.

1108
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:58,913
Thanks.

1109
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,110
Your bet.

1110
01:24:34,115 --> 01:24:36,618
-Your bet.
-$3.

1111
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:38,536
I call.

1112
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:41,206
Who's winning all the money?

1113
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,043
Been playing long?

1114
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:48,338
Ask the bartender. He's got a watch.

1115
01:24:49,714 --> 01:24:52,550
What do you know
about Joe Clemens, Yancey?

1116
01:24:52,926 --> 01:24:55,303
No more than you, except that he's dead.

1117
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:57,305
How did you know he was dead?

1118
01:24:58,014 --> 01:24:59,933
I heard some of the boys talking.

1119
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:02,977
People keep dropping in and out of here
all the time.

1120
01:25:03,144 --> 01:25:04,396
Bet you $5.

1121
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:08,900
I call.

1122
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:12,654
Three fives.

1123
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:21,204
-You're under arrest, Yancey.
-For what?

1124
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:23,206
For the murder of Joe Clemens.

1125
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,336
Keep my stack, Bud.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1126
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:31,840
I wouldn't count on that if I were you.
Take him along, Rusty.

1127
01:25:44,227 --> 01:25:46,980
What's the matter, Taylor?
Are you nervous?

1128
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:49,232
Go ahead. Deal them.

1129
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:53,278
Yancey seemed a little vague
about this game.

1130
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:55,488
Suppose you tell me what happened.

1131
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:56,656
How should I know?

1132
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,200
-Why don't you ask one of them?
-I'm asking you.

1133
01:25:59,284 --> 01:26:02,412
Did Yancey ever leave this table
after the game started?

1134
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:05,040
No. He never left the room.

1135
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:08,293
I told you a hundred times,
he never went out of the place.

1136
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:10,045
Come on, you're wasting valuable time.

1137
01:26:10,128 --> 01:26:13,214
-Answer my question.
-No, he never left the table.

1138
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:14,966
Stop lying. You're bad at it.

1139
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:18,219
Yancey left that room
between midnight and 1 :00, didn't he?

1140
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:19,679
-No.
-What time was it, then?

1141
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:20,722
He didn't leave.

1142
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:23,099
Let me work on him, Wade.
I can make him talk.

1143
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:24,559
If you can't, I can.

1144
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:27,520
Let him alone.
Listen, if you're too stupid to realize...

1145
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:31,316
you're facing a charge of murder,
you deserve what's coming to you.

1146
01:26:33,526 --> 01:26:34,694
What do you mean?

1147
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:38,198
I'm gonna have you indicted for murder
as an accessory after the fact.

1148
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:39,491
I had nothing to do with it.

1149
01:26:39,574 --> 01:26:42,035
You're gonna be dancing in thin air
the same as Yancey.

1150
01:26:42,118 --> 01:26:45,163
Do you wanna swing,
or you wanna tell me and save your neck?

1151
01:26:45,246 --> 01:26:47,457
All right. I'll tell you.

1152
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:49,668
Come on.

1153
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:53,922
He went out about 12:30.
Came back in about half an hour.

1154
01:26:54,297 --> 01:26:55,590
That's better.

1155
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:03,765
I'll do you a favor, Taylor.

1156
01:27:03,848 --> 01:27:05,058
Lock him up.

1157
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:16,528
-Good morning, Mrs. Irving.
-Good morning.

1158
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:18,738
Morning. Did you get anything
out of Taylor?

1159
01:27:18,822 --> 01:27:19,906
I did. Where's the doctor?

1160
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:21,741
-ln there. What's wrong?
-What'd he say?

1161
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:23,535
Morning, Mr. Hatton. Won't you join us?

1162
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:24,953
No, thanks. I came to tell you...

1163
01:27:25,036 --> 01:27:28,206
it's imperative you get Miss Abbie
out of town as soon as possible.

1164
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:29,416
Why, for heaven's sake?

1165
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:32,669
Because only two people beside myself
heard Surrett tell that lie...

1166
01:27:32,752 --> 01:27:35,255
that he saw Matt Cole
lose his money playing roulette.

1167
01:27:35,338 --> 01:27:38,591
One of those people was Joe Clemens.
That's why Surrett killed him.

1168
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:41,594
You're the only other person
who can bear me out in court.

1169
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:44,389
Without you, he can deny it
and the jury might believe him.

1170
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:46,433
That's all the more reason
why I should stay.

1171
01:27:46,474 --> 01:27:48,601
I started this,
and I'm going to see it through.

1172
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:49,978
Will you not be a little idiot?

1173
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:53,314
You're life isn't worth a nickel
as long as Surrett stays out of jail.

1174
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:55,316
You're the key to our case
and he knows it.

1175
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,362
We can't go to trial for two weeks.
Your life's gonna be in danger till then.

1176
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:01,823
Even in this house,
on the street, everywhere.

1177
01:28:01,865 --> 01:28:03,658
I know Surrett and I know what he'd do.

1178
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:06,619
You know I'm right, Doctor.
I want you to get her out of town.

1179
01:28:06,661 --> 01:28:08,288
And stay out till I send for you.

1180
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:10,165
-You're right.
-I see what you mean.

1181
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:12,125
Abbie must take the next train for Wichita.

1182
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,961
She can stay with the Merrills.
I'll pack a valise at once.

1183
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:16,963
Come and help me get it down
off the shelf.

1184
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,632
I'd never forgive myself
if anything happened to her.

1185
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:24,054
-I won't go. You can't boss me around.
-Can I not, now?

1186
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:26,556
I'm the law in this town
and you'll do as I say.

1187
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,683
I don't care what you are, I'm staying here.

1188
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:29,893
Aunt Ellen, don't pack--

1189
01:28:29,976 --> 01:28:32,395
You are the most stubborn female
I ever met in my life.

1190
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,981
Can't you understand I'm doing this
because I love you?

1191
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:37,359
All right, you two. Stop arguing.

1192
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:40,278
Don't worry, Mrs. Irving. We've stopped.

1193
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,915
What he needs is a rope.
He don't deserve a trial.

1194
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:54,751
Hand him over to us. We'll give him a trial.

1195
01:28:56,878 --> 01:28:58,672
This is more like it.

1196
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:01,883
The last time I saw a mob like that
was in Texas...

1197
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:04,219
when they gave Curley Hawks
a necktie party.

1198
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,845
Mr. Grant, I want to talk to you.

1199
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:08,223
There's your man. You got 10 minutes.

1200
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:10,809
-Hello, Yancey.
-Hello.

1201
01:29:12,894 --> 01:29:14,854
What's going on here?
What's the mob doing--

1202
01:29:14,938 --> 01:29:16,690
Now, take it easy, Yancey.

1203
01:29:19,567 --> 01:29:21,444
You might as well know this now as later.

1204
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:24,364
They wormed it out of Taylor
that you left for a half hour.

1205
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:26,908
They can't hang me on that.
I might have gone anywhere.

1206
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:29,035
Maybe a jury wouldn't hang you...

1207
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:31,162
if you ever get to a jury.

1208
01:29:31,746 --> 01:29:33,415
What do you mean by that?

1209
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:35,291
What're you trying to say?

1210
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:38,753
Joe Clemens
was a mighty well-liked man, Yancey.

1211
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:40,463
He had a lot of friends.

1212
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:43,967
Half the city is planning
to break in here tonight...

1213
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:46,052
and take things in their own hands.

1214
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:48,972
Where's Jeff?
He's gotta get me out of here.

1215
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:53,184
I telegraphed him an hour ago.
He got off the train at Spearville.

1216
01:29:53,351 --> 01:29:55,562
He got off? For what?

1217
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:59,399
Jeff's smart enough to know
this town's gonna be warm for a few days.

1218
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:03,403
So he's just laying low
until the excitement blows over.

1219
01:30:03,486 --> 01:30:04,863
Too warm for him?

1220
01:30:04,946 --> 01:30:07,240
So I stay here
and get hung for doing his job.

1221
01:30:08,074 --> 01:30:10,285
-lf you think that l--
-Shut up, you fool!

1222
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:13,121
-You want to tell the whole town?
-You bet I'll tell them.

1223
01:30:13,163 --> 01:30:16,041
I'll tell them who paid me
to shoot Joe Clemens and Matt Cole.

1224
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:19,210
Let them hang me, sure.
But if I go, Jeff's going with me.

1225
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:21,171
You rustle him up and telegraph him that.

1226
01:30:21,254 --> 01:30:24,841
He has to get me out by tonight
or I'm giving the whole story to Hatton.

1227
01:30:25,175 --> 01:30:27,469
But how can Jeff get you out of here?

1228
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:30,513
I don't know. That's his problem.

1229
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:32,974
Keep your shirt on, Yancey.

1230
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:36,394
I got an idea
how Jeff and I can handle this.

1231
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:38,146
First I'll see Hatton.

1232
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:40,899
You got the right man, Hatton.
What are you waiting for?

1233
01:30:40,982 --> 01:30:42,275
Yeah, what are we waiting for?

1234
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:44,444
If you don't know
what to do with Yancey, we do.

1235
01:30:44,527 --> 01:30:47,072
-You bet we do.
-Will you give us some action?

1236
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:48,990
If he won't, we will give him some action.

1237
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:51,284
What are you stalling for?
You know he killed him.

1238
01:30:51,326 --> 01:30:54,162
If you don't turn him over to us,
we'll come get him tonight.

1239
01:30:54,245 --> 01:30:57,791
Listen, men, you fellas put me
in this office to enforce the law.

1240
01:30:57,832 --> 01:30:59,209
And I'm going to enforce it.

1241
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:02,170
That means a fair trial
for any and all prisoners.

1242
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:03,588
Including Yancey.

1243
01:31:04,881 --> 01:31:06,633
And understand this:

1244
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:11,304
There is going to be no mob rule
around this town as long as I am sheriff.

1245
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:19,104
They're bringing up a pole
for a battering ram.

1246
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:21,564
You see? They're right at the door.
Listen to them.

1247
01:31:21,648 --> 01:31:23,858
You're in charge, Sheriff.
What are you gonna do?

1248
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:27,195
Wade, what are we gonna do?
The whole town's set on getting him out.

1249
01:31:27,237 --> 01:31:29,698
You can't stop them,
the five of you against the town.

1250
01:31:29,739 --> 01:31:31,700
They'd burn down the building
to get in here.

1251
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:34,411
We'd save a lot of trouble
if we'd feed him to the mob.

1252
01:31:34,494 --> 01:31:37,122
You want to throw my client
to that pack of hungry wolves?

1253
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:40,166
Listen, no one's gonna get your client
but a jury.

1254
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,919
-I promise you that.
-There's only one way to protect him.

1255
01:31:43,003 --> 01:31:46,006
Yancey's gotta be taken
out of Dodge City before night.

1256
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:48,675
Fat chance we'd have
of getting him to the station.

1257
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:51,469
You can hire a closed carriage,
drive him to Spearville...

1258
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:53,054
and catch the train for Wichita.

1259
01:31:53,138 --> 01:31:55,890
Keep him in jail there
till he can be tried legally.

1260
01:31:55,974 --> 01:31:58,101
-Yes, that might work.
-lt will work.

1261
01:31:58,184 --> 01:32:00,228
My client's entitled to a fair trial...

1262
01:32:00,311 --> 01:32:02,564
and it's both our jobs
to see that he gets it.

1263
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:05,191
You want me to rustle a carriage, Wade?

1264
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:08,236
Wait a minute. I got a better idea.

1265
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:10,488
But you agree
we got to get him out in a hurry?

1266
01:32:10,572 --> 01:32:12,407
Yes, but we'll do it my way.

1267
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:22,709
-This is a sample of your future.
-Get in, Russ. Get in.

1268
01:32:24,836 --> 01:32:28,214
Hold them off as long as you can.
I'll send word from Wichita.

1269
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:06,920
-Say, what the--
-Keep calm, it's official business. Come on.

1270
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:13,885
I'm Sheriff Hatton of Dodge City.
I've got a prisoner here for Wichita.

1271
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:17,430
-ls it all right if we ride with you?
-All right, Sheriff.

1272
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:54,259
-Mind shutting and locking this door?
-Not a bit.

1273
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:55,885
Get over there.

1274
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:03,351
You can sit there
and rest your face and hands.

1275
01:34:07,188 --> 01:34:09,691
How many stops do you make
between here and Wichita?

1276
01:34:09,774 --> 01:34:11,526
-None.
-Good.

1277
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:29,711
Keep going. I'll tell you what to do.

1278
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:39,721
Put 'em up.

1279
01:34:39,804 --> 01:34:41,723
-But, gentlemen--
-Take him away, Joe.

1280
01:34:41,765 --> 01:34:43,016
Get in there.

1281
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:20,345
Get your hands up.

1282
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:22,931
Get them up, I said!

1283
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:27,435
Now unlock those cuffs.

1284
01:36:34,336 --> 01:36:36,087
We've gotta stop. The train's on fire.

1285
01:36:36,171 --> 01:36:38,006
Don't slow down till the water tower.

1286
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:56,024
Hold it, Jeff! We're all gonna burn.

1287
01:37:02,822 --> 01:37:06,159
Got a friend of yours here, Hatton.
Take a good look.

1288
01:37:06,284 --> 01:37:07,827
Throw me those guns!

1289
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:17,796
Pick them up.

1290
01:37:18,755 --> 01:37:20,382
Unlock those handcuffs!

1291
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:23,468
Come on! Hurry up!

1292
01:37:36,356 --> 01:37:37,732
Close that door.

1293
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:44,906
Rusty, this end.

1294
01:37:51,538 --> 01:37:52,622
Look out!

1295
01:39:02,233 --> 01:39:03,360
Hurry up!

1296
01:39:56,871 --> 01:39:58,873
So the lamb killed the butcher.

1297
01:40:02,377 --> 01:40:05,547
Now, listen to that.
Singing hymns and it ain't even Sunday.

1298
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:07,841
No one in sight even friendly drunk.

1299
01:40:08,383 --> 01:40:12,178
Doggone, if this place ain't getting
so pure and noble it ain't fit to live in.

1300
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,305
I'm sure enough going back to Texas now.

1301
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:16,641
Imagine asking me
to lead the Pure Prairie League.

1302
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:19,185
Why not? You're one
of the leading lights in it, I hear.

1303
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:22,230
First thing you know, they'll be starting
a chamber of commerce.

1304
01:40:22,272 --> 01:40:24,232
-Faith, it's not possible.
-What?

1305
01:40:24,274 --> 01:40:25,775
Look, Col. Dodge.

1306
01:40:29,237 --> 01:40:31,072
-Hello, Colonel.
-How're you, Colonel?

1307
01:40:31,114 --> 01:40:32,282
Hi, Colonel.

1308
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:33,700
How are you, boys?

1309
01:40:33,742 --> 01:40:35,827
By golly, Wade, it's good to see you alive.

1310
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,288
-It's good to be alive.
-Come on up.

1311
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:43,251
-Hello, Colonel.
-Wade. By golly, son, it's good to see you.

1312
01:40:43,335 --> 01:40:45,378
Hello, Tex. How are you, Rusty?

1313
01:40:45,503 --> 01:40:47,839
I couldn't complain, Colonel.
Wouldn't do no good.

1314
01:40:47,922 --> 01:40:49,132
Sit down over there, sir.

1315
01:40:49,215 --> 01:40:52,552
I've come all the way from Virginia City,
Nevada, just to see you.

1316
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:55,096
I'm building a railroad there
from San Francisco.

1317
01:40:55,138 --> 01:40:57,223
It's the richest square mile on earth.

1318
01:40:57,265 --> 01:41:00,685
Gold, silver, copper.
We've got a solid mountain of the stuff.

1319
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:03,355
But it's a bad town, Wade.
A wild, murderous town.

1320
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:06,024
Worse than Dodge City ever was
before you cleaned it up.

1321
01:41:06,107 --> 01:41:07,567
And that's saying a good deal.

1322
01:41:07,609 --> 01:41:10,820
-I want you to come back with me.
-I knowed our luck had changed.

1323
01:41:10,904 --> 01:41:12,655
We've got 4,000 people out there.

1324
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:15,533
Decent men and women with families
who are living in terror.

1325
01:41:15,617 --> 01:41:17,786
Think of them 4,000 poor people.

1326
01:41:17,869 --> 01:41:19,871
There might be more
by the time we get there.

1327
01:41:19,954 --> 01:41:21,122
We need you, son.

1328
01:41:21,206 --> 01:41:23,375
The city is teeming
with crime and corruption.

1329
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:24,876
What law we've tried has failed...

1330
01:41:24,959 --> 01:41:28,254
because the men behind it hadn't
the brains and courage to back it up.

1331
01:41:28,296 --> 01:41:30,924
You can get plenty of men
for that job out here, Colonel.

1332
01:41:31,007 --> 01:41:33,510
I'm getting married next week.
Got tickets for New York.

1333
01:41:33,593 --> 01:41:35,720
Shucks, you can get married anytime.

1334
01:41:35,804 --> 01:41:38,431
We'll even go on your honeymoon
with you to Virginia City.

1335
01:41:38,515 --> 01:41:39,557
Thanks.

1336
01:41:39,641 --> 01:41:42,185
Getting married
has ruined a lot of good men.

1337
01:41:44,145 --> 01:41:46,106
Doesn't it mean anything to you to know...

1338
01:41:46,147 --> 01:41:49,401
that someplace there's terror and death
that you could put a stop to?

1339
01:41:49,484 --> 01:41:52,612
Yes, it does, Colonel.
But the decision isn't as simple as that.

1340
01:41:52,696 --> 01:41:56,282
If I were free, it might be different.
I'll soon have a wife to take care of.

1341
01:41:56,366 --> 01:41:58,284
Abbie doesn't want
to go pioneering anymore.

1342
01:41:58,326 --> 01:42:01,996
We're planning on coming back here
from New York and settling down.

1343
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:06,501
There's a wagon train leaving here
the middle of next week for Nevada.

1344
01:42:09,212 --> 01:42:11,673
It'd be a great trip, wouldn't it?

1345
01:42:19,556 --> 01:42:23,435
Hello, darling. I was just telling the boys
how we're going to settle down....

1346
01:42:23,518 --> 01:42:25,311
-Lemonade?
-Thank you.

1347
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,482
-Lemonade?
-Thank you, ma'am.

1348
01:42:36,698 --> 01:42:40,577
Darling, I was just telling Col. Dodge
about our honeymoon in New York.

1349
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:45,540
How we're going to see all the shops,
theatres, and Niagara Falls, and things.

1350
01:42:51,171 --> 01:42:54,799
Col. Dodge, when do we start
for Virginia City?

1351
01:42:56,092 --> 01:42:58,970
Wade, it looks like
you're marrying the right girl.

1352
01:43:00,638 --> 01:43:02,557
Virginia City!

1353
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:08,980
