194
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:47,828
He' s very good Cocksman

195
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:48,768
Hark Rock?

196
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:49,533

She' s quite a pretty, huh?

199
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,279
You know it

200
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:00,545
Hey, you like to make love at Max?

201
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:02,380
Arlenika and Hard Rock?

202
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,249

203
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,151
That' s good

204
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,280
That' s heaven, kid

205
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:07,482
She' ll do?

206
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,285
She' s ready

207
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:09,189
Shall we try?

208
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,419
We can get a shot for trying

209
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:11,927
Why don' t you ask her first?

210
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,928
How is it for a bitch?

211
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:15,329
Okay, you may tear off a piss

212
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:15,989
A Piss?

213
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:16,965
Hard Rock' s piss?

214
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:18,001
What did I tell you?

215
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:18,728
She' s ready

216
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,237
Let' s not keep the lady waiting

217
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:42,781
Okay, you win-"okay

218
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,379
Let go of me

219
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:45,887
You guys should me a good time

220
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,822
She' s speaking English

221
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:44,471
James, what' s the matter?

222
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:47,750
Nothing, dear-"absolutely nothing

223
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,409
What are you gazing like that?

224
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,851
You look ill

225
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,429
Good heaven-"James, close your eyes

226
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:01,390
Put your clothes

227
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:02,931
on your shameless husky body

228
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,035
You' ve never seen a pair of bulls?

229
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:07,664
What language-"hippies?

230
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,705
She got to be a hippie

231
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,933
Give me a break, Sir

232
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:14,602
James, I' ve told you to close your eyes

233
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,045
Jamie, look---

234
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,150
LOQk...

235
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:22,719
See heaven

236
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:24,652
Young lady, you go away from here---

237
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,086
or I' ll call the police

238
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:28,750
Bye, honey---bye

239
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:33,594
Bye...

240
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:12,864
I hope the son of a bitch will show up

241
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:13,802
I' ll kill her

242
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:16,238
Oh, what I want to do is to find
the damn car

243
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:25,508
Hey, look-"here, s the car

244
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,444
She has left the key in it

245
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:36,515
Gentlemen"-

246
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:39,056
You should know you can't park here

247
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:40,317
What does this jerk want?

248
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,621
The jerk says you park at where says
'No Parking' and

249
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:46,924
will cost you 1,000 ranus

250
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:51,058
And for the jerk, that' ll cost another
1,000 ranus

251
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,603
That' s 2,000 ranus altogether

252
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:54,899
2,000 ranus?

253
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:57,033
Oh, as for your insolence,

254
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,505
there' s a special charge which brings to

255
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,078
3,000 ranus

256
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,340
The more we talk, the more it costs"-
great

257
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,176
Your friend has a great fortune

258
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:06,681
If I lay my hand on that bitch---

259
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:08,046
I' ll get this all back and

260
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:09,550
I' ll take n out in kind

261
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:15,524
And so, on this second day of this odyssey

262
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:18,459
in which I bumped into
in the same old way

263
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:20,826
Except for the gorgeous scenery- --

264
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:23,932
otherwise I encountered an attempted

265
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,935
rape by a couple of guerillas
who kept yelling

266
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:29,166
after getting kick from my boot

267
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:30,634
Poor fellows

268
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:32,776
Why everyone is so hung up sexually?

269
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,971
Why they always go bananas?

270
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,179
Does it have to be such a big thing?

271
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:39,442
Why can' tit be natural?

272
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:05,664
Hello

273
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,662
I was hungry, so I help myself

274
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:08,771
It' s good soup

275
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:09,600
What do you do?

276
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:10,299
You drop by the sky?

277
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:11,339
Out of space

278
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:12,773
I hope you've got a nice fall

279
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,672
I' m sorry

280
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:14,768
I don' t mean to disturb you

281
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,210
But you're really into it beautifully

282
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:18,247
You two really have a ball together

283
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:19,576
I should hope so

284
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,812
What would you do in our case
by watching?

285
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,010
What are you saying?

286
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:24,178
It seems so funny

287
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:24,981
What?

288
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:26,612
I always thought watching people make love

289
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:27,553
would turn me on

290
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:28,624
I guess I was wrong

291
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:29,591
You want to try it?

292
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,420
No

293
00:21:30,594 --> 00:21:32,221
You might learn a few tricks

294
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,606
You have a place to hold on tonight?

295
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:48,007
I thought if I could stay here

296
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:49,712
Okay with you?

297
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,544
Sure if you don' t mind

298
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:51,297
Do you love her?

299
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:52,000
Sure...

300
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,941
If I didn' t, I wouldn' t make love
with her

301
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:54,840
I don' t know

302
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:56,640
Have you known her very long?

303
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:58,010
Three whole days

304
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,280
You don' t think other girls
in love with?

305
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:04,886
I love them all

306
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:06,183
Oh...

307
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:29,301
Baby, I want you now

308
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:32,245
Let me go-"baby, go away

309
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:36,612
Keep hard for the little boy' s room

310
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:39,316
I' ll join you

311
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:57,835
Did you say you had to go too?

312
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,239
I intend to

313
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,875
Hey, you're not timid, are you?

314
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:05,140
Me?

315
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:11,044
No point being shy what comes natural?

316
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:13,780
You got your hang-up-"I got mine

317
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:22,930
After you, my lady

318
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:24,557
Thank you, my lord

319
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:37,376
Sure you don' t mind what I do, sweetie?

320
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:39,415
No---l' m sorry

321
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,475
Hello

322
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:06,144
What are you doing here?

323
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,115
I'm lying down-"who are you?

324
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:09,911
What' s the idea?

325
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:11,782
You got any good idea?

326
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:13,583
I'm fresh out-"what do you want?

327
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:15,317
Come in---I entertain your visit

328
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:19,553
You want a cigarette?

329
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:20,754
They' re mine

330
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:21,921
So?

331
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:29,436
Mind to take me on this cruise?

332
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:33,032
I don' teat much"-
though I don' t bump on the right side

333
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:35,144
And suppose I don' t need a female
aboard?

334
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,872
No Problem...

335
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:43,181
If you're not hurry---
I look for another boat

336
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:46,288
You want to bet he' ll have me aboard?

337
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:53,552
I warn you---Joe is a bastard

338
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,721
But you're nobody at all

339
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:58,301
Okay, a good cruise is hard to find

340
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:02,697
Can you cook?

341
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,064
No

342
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:06,604
Don't you ask silly questions?

343
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:44,786
I suppose you got a name

344
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:47,022
Barbara---it' <i>s</i> just a trial

345
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:49,029
I was supposed to work in Munich

346
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:50,930
Who wants to work at 19?

347
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,034
I caught out

348
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:54,500
My old man then pulled the poor banana---

349
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:56,504
so I grew up broken crazy

350
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:59,376
Tell me about yourself

351
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:03,844
Here-"drink up

352
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:08,013
So, what' s the story of your life?

353
00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:16,426
The name is Tom---the age is 28

354
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:19,255
I' m living in a friend' s place in Purais

355
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:22,724
I' m a foreign correspondent
for a news agency

356
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:24,800
I spend as much time on my boat

357
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:26,892
doing nothing as I can manage

358
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,337
My father is in the best of his health

359
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:31,601
My mother is hardly normal

360
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:35,134
How many girlfriends you've got?

361
00:34:35,278 --> 00:34:36,768
None at present

362
00:34:37,414 --> 00:34:39,473
How many you've known?

363
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,684
I'm no good in statistics

364
00:34:42,786 --> 00:34:43,753
Approximately

365
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:45,014
Why would you want to know?

366
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:47,056
I always want to know what' s that

367
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:50,026
Are you saying you never took a girl
to bed?

368
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:51,685
I must be frank you mean?

369
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:52,989
Yeah

370
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:54,827
I' m sorry it' s not true

371
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:56,262
You make jacker?

372
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,390
Hm...

373
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:58,968
You got to be a jack then

374
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:00,194
You got to be a dice

375
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,701
Don tbe so sure-HI' m not

376
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:03,967
I' m not so sure what I really am

377
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,564
I' m not so sure what' s a dice worth

378
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:06,665
and I don' t care a damn

379
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,175
So far what you're doing,

380
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:09,073
the smell is what I' ve found

381
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,203
Thanks

382
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:15,249
It' s so far false, don' t you flatter?

383
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,283
How about a trial?

384
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,292
Don't you sometimes

385
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:34,234
feel so lonely all by yourself?

386
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:35,429
I'm not alone now

387
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:37,529
You' re not-"right

388
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:55,318
Be careful, the deck is slippery

389
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,789
Barbara“.

390
00:35:57,127 --> 00:36:00,688
Barbara, I' m talking to you

391
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:03,495
Are you talking to me?

392
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,329
Of course, who else?

393
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:06,925
Who said my name is Barbara?

394
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,299
Barbara was the name you said

395
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:09,666
Oh, yes-"it, s the one

396
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:11,707
You won' t say I' m stoned, will you?

397
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:12,606
No-"just not

398
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:13,905
You think I' m gonna crazy?

399
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,000
A little

400
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:18,115
Question---
can a hermit and fruit make together?

401
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:20,277
Do you think I' m nude?

402
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:53,877
You' re really superb

403
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:55,951
You' re even better on your own yacht

404
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,452
And I got a lovely girl in the cabin

405
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:01,422
What do you plan to do tonight?

406
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:04,619
Do you really think I can fall asleep?

407
00:37:05,328 --> 00:37:06,762
You keep mosquito here

408
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,158
No...

409
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:11,591
You won' t go to help

410
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:14,204
Are you coming over to kiss me
goodnight?

411
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,838
You' re supposed to do that

412
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,701
I never have to do that

413
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:20,606
Women are supposed experts for
such a thing

414
00:37:20,744 --> 00:37:22,974
I guess you should

415
00:42:48,538 --> 00:42:50,529
You know I think I' m in love

416
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:51,902
You mean you're not sure

417
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,702
How can I be sure?

418
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:31,435
Sometimes it just happened that way

419
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:32,598
On a Greek island,

420
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:34,243
I met a wonderful man

421
00:44:34,377 --> 00:44:37,108
His name is Tom-"handsome and gentle

422
00:44:37,213 --> 00:44:39,238
And I feel good when I' m with him

423
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:40,180
I still don' t know---

424
00:44:40,283 --> 00:44:41,512
is it because I' m in love or

425
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:43,779
because he makes love so well

426
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:46,512
But after all, what makes the difference

427
00:44:46,622 --> 00:44:48,488
if I' m in love and great?

428
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:50,148
If I' m not, so what?

429
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:53,092
But counted I' m happy like everyday

430
00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:54,719
I can use new discovery

431
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:56,992
as nothing after the foam

432
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:10,829
Not a single buddy I should look at
twice

433
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,696
It must be kidding us

434
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:13,030
about all the actions in Greece

435
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:14,399
It got to be some asshole around

436
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:15,299
like our girl friend is

437
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:16,270
You call that asshole---

438
00:47:16,372 --> 00:47:18,204
As a matter of fact, she' s a bitch
I call it

439
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,401
I' d still rather be a poor fellow

440
00:47:19,475 --> 00:47:21,375
than a bishop every night

441
00:47:21,544 --> 00:47:22,875
Yeah, maybemtime' s up

442
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:25,838
You know what I need?

443
00:47:25,948 --> 00:47:26,972
Nothing-"you have me

444
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:28,141
I need sunglasses

445
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:30,285
Well, you can a pair anywhere

446
00:47:30,886 --> 00:47:31,409
There---

447
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:31,952
Where?

448
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:32,510
Al Trimond

449
00:47:32,588 --> 00:47:33,146
I' ll wait for you

450
00:47:33,255 --> 00:47:33,949
Take all these

451
00:47:34,023 --> 00:47:34,581
I!

452
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,057
Hey, you' ll break the camel' s back

453
00:47:40,663 --> 00:47:43,132
Hey---I need a pair of sunglasses

454
00:47:43,232 --> 00:47:45,496
You shouldn' t hide some videos

455
00:47:45,668 --> 00:47:47,102
Thank you

456
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:50,832
No-"they, re not my style

457
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:52,463
How about the white one?

458
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:54,802
Not too big for me?

459
00:47:54,977 --> 00:47:56,502
That' s perfect

460
00:47:56,979 --> 00:47:57,844
Now, look---

461
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,641
Yeah-"how much are they?

462
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:01,716
For you, they' re free

463
00:48:01,884 --> 00:48:04,216
I got something else you like too

464
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:06,216
It' s for you

465
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:06,914
No...

466
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:07,716
Please, you must

467
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:08,551
Please, you must

468
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:09,216
I couldn' t

469
00:48:09,325 --> 00:48:11,953
Yes, you could-"you, ll please me

470
00:48:15,898 --> 00:48:17,366
Greeks like to push you sometimes

471
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:18,194
Do they?

472
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:19,130
He was nice

473
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:20,828
He gave me the shawl

474
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:22,131
He refused to receive anything

475
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:23,603
for the sunglasses either

476
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:25,165
Hey...

477
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:26,940

478
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:27,702

00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,437

a table each guy you get off with

491
00:49:18,194 --> 00:49:19,218
Hm?

492
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:20,891

I think you're just nuts

498
00:49:31,006 --> 00:49:32,269
Huh?

499
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:38,113
You plan on wearing this shawl

500
00:49:38,214 --> 00:49:39,409
for the Greek tonight?

501
00:49:39,515 --> 00:49:41,176
If it' s good, why not?

502
00:49:50,226 --> 00:49:51,125
Tom...

503
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,918
Tom, come here-"quick

504
00:49:54,063 --> 00:49:55,121
Oh...

00:49:56,932 --> 00:49:58,400
Look, one hand“.

506
00:49:58,534 --> 00:50:00,229
You' ve got yourself a sailor

507
00:50:52,555 --> 00:50:54,182
Hey, come and dance

508
00:50:54,323 --> 00:50:55,119

Come on-"let, s try it

No---l' m not up to it

00:50:58,527 --> 00:50:59,790
In that case, you just have a look

512
00:51:45,641 --> 00:51:46,972
Huh, what do you know?

513
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:48,474
Hey, man-"you look

Son of a bitch-Hit' <i>s</i> her

We' ll give that bitch a lesson

516
00:51:56,452 --> 00:51:57,476
Later on

517
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,961
You had enough of that stuff

So I see---she gave you the finger too

526
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:00,746
So what?

527
00:53:00,883 --> 00:53:01,873
She really gets it, doesn' t she?

528
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:03,246
She has the life gun

529
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:05,476
Her body drives you against the wall"-
right?

530
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:07,749
You can't say she' s worth 3,000 ranus
that much"-

531
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:08,857
a little thief

532
00:53:09,024 --> 00:53:09,923
Yeah"-

533
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:11,151
Still it all depends

534
00:53:11,326 --> 00:53:12,487
It' s not much that gets from the pro

535
00:53:12,628 --> 00:53:14,027
A hot lass can supply

536
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:15,688
Get under-"she knows the angles---

537
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:18,290
just like pilling

538
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:20,893
Excuse me

539
00:53:34,983 --> 00:53:35,950
Shelefl

540
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:36,947
Where did she go?

541
00:53:37,086 --> 00:53:37,848
They told me the activity

542
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,579
They went to love together

543
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:41,053
You know what that means

544
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,282
No-"thanks

545
00:53:58,207 --> 00:53:59,299
All life is love---

546
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:00,442
all life is to beloved

547
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:02,270
Without love, that' s death

548
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:03,936
We must take love when it' s here

549
00:54:04,113 --> 00:54:04,944
No

550
00:54:05,047 --> 00:54:05,912
Love is all

551
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:07,209
No

552
00:54:45,621 --> 00:54:47,350
Here-"get hold of this to your pals

553
00:54:47,556 --> 00:54:48,580
What do you mean?

554
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,784
3,000 ranus is too much for one

555
00:54:50,893 --> 00:54:52,156
What' s this 3,000 ranus?

556
00:54:52,261 --> 00:54:53,490
Don't play damn with me

557
00:54:53,629 --> 00:54:54,562
You know what I mean, baby

558
00:54:54,696 --> 00:54:56,061
That' s what you call the butcher"-
right?

559
00:54:56,165 --> 00:54:56,927
That' sit

560
00:55:57,726 --> 00:55:59,785
Hi

561
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:04,323
Won' t you drink one more?

562
00:56:04,533 --> 00:56:05,466
Why not?

563
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:46,925
I'm glad you come back

564
00:58:49,531 --> 00:58:51,863
I haven' t stopped thinking of you

565
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,001
Why you keep staring at me?

566
00:58:57,172 --> 00:58:59,004
Tom---kiss me

567
00:58:59,474 --> 00:59:01,033
Don't you want to?

568
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:02,635
Let!
S Q0

569
00:59:07,816 --> 00:59:09,978
What kind a game you play with me?

570
00:59:10,085 --> 00:59:12,679
It' <i>s</i> not a game---l' m in love with you

571
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:15,518
But I don' t want you to get the wrong
idea of me

572
00:59:15,657 --> 00:59:16,783
Do you understand?

573
00:59:16,925 --> 00:59:17,687
No

574
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,193
Tom ---I have problems

575
00:59:20,328 --> 00:59:21,386
Such as?

576
00:59:21,563 --> 00:59:22,359
Myself

577
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:23,623
I figure that

578
00:59:25,033 --> 00:59:26,967
You really don' t understand, do you?

579
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:28,833
You don' t understand anything about me

580
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,869
No

581
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:31,302
I' m not what you think

582
00:59:32,808 --> 00:59:36,176
You went to bed with the Greek---
didn' t you?

583
00:59:37,512 --> 00:59:39,071
Yes-"yes, I did

584
00:59:39,347 --> 00:59:40,906
Why did you come back?

585
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:42,479
I don' t know

586
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:44,642
Why can't you accept me the way I am?

587
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,686
I don' t even know who you are

588
00:59:46,855 --> 00:59:48,550
Neither do I

589
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,055
I' m trying to find that out

590
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:53,025
But, in any case, I' m not
what you're thinking, Tom

591
00:59:53,995 --> 00:59:57,795
You still haven' t kissed me---
don' t you want to?

592
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,094
What I got to lose?

593
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:01,168
Tom, what do you want?

594
01:00:20,922 --> 01:00:22,515
I'm telling you the truth

595
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:24,785
You know I' m supposed to be in Munich

596
01:00:24,926 --> 01:00:26,826
But I' m here in the beach as my world

597
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:28,794
How does a Greek beach get to be
a world?

598
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,694
I'm with you as a world

599
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:34,692
What' s so interesting in me?

600
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,029
I like how you think-"your body"-

601
01:00:37,172 --> 01:00:38,071
your action

602
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,265
And you're crazy when you get mad

603
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,638
that makes me look so miserable

604
01:00:41,776 --> 01:00:42,800
Was I wrong to leave?

605
01:00:42,944 --> 01:00:43,843
Well, you should

606
01:00:44,012 --> 01:00:45,138
Something is growing to love?

607
01:00:45,313 --> 01:00:46,474
Maybe not

608
01:00:50,252 --> 01:00:52,084
Take your blouse off

609
01:00:52,254 --> 01:00:53,153
What?

610
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:54,720
Take it off

611
01:01:13,942 --> 01:01:15,171
Anything wrong?

612
01:01:15,277 --> 01:01:16,642
You won' t rather do it for me?

613
01:01:20,982 --> 01:01:22,381
Now what?

614
01:01:23,051 --> 01:01:24,576
Touch your breasts

615
01:01:24,753 --> 01:01:25,549
But why?

616
01:01:25,687 --> 01:01:26,916
Because I ask you

617
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:29,821
You mean like this?

618
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,619
Caress them

619
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,091
It' s your first time, isn' tit?

620
01:01:37,265 --> 01:01:38,426
I should not-"why?

621
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:41,866
Now tell me how you feel

622
01:01:42,003 --> 01:01:43,334
Warm-"good

623
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:46,371
Take the nipples in your fingers

624
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:50,903
That exacts you?

625
01:01:51,012 --> 01:01:51,877
Yes

626
01:01:52,247 --> 01:01:54,375
I suppose you often get up like that

627
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:56,109
Yes, sometimes

628
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:15,901
Tom---kiss me

629
01:02:16,104 --> 01:02:16,935
No-"not yet

630
01:02:17,138 --> 01:02:18,264
Why?

631
01:02:18,373 --> 01:02:19,431
That' ll turn you on?

632
01:02:34,089 --> 01:02:35,682
You do this for others too?

633
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:36,916
What others?

634
01:02:37,058 --> 01:02:38,253
The ones you sleep with

635
01:02:38,426 --> 01:02:39,723
What do you mean?

636
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:42,789
The trick you toured with the Greek
dancer

637
01:02:43,331 --> 01:02:44,492
I' m a whore you think?

638
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:46,197
I go for August

639
01:02:46,368 --> 01:02:47,392
Why you buck me?

640
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:48,435
I don' t have to do this thing

641
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,197
So ask me---
 don' t have any secrets

642
01:02:50,305 --> 01:02:51,170
So mind your own business

643
01:02:51,306 --> 01:02:52,899
You can treat yourself like a hooker

644
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:54,372
if you need a pro and get one

645
01:02:55,076 --> 01:02:56,339
Get dressed---l' m taking you back

646
01:02:56,478 --> 01:02:58,469
Oh, don' t go into trouble"-
you're so busy

647
01:02:59,714 --> 01:03:03,082
Tom, what' s your telephone number?

648
01:03:03,218 --> 01:03:04,947
You' ll find me in the phone book

649
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:07,387
Tom, you're a fool

650
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,752
It' s finished-"Tom is gone

651
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,619
Goodbye, my heart

652
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:15,526
It' s too good to that

653
01:03:15,664 --> 01:03:18,099
So, here I' m on my own again

654
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:21,533
Hurt so much doesn' t help the pride

655
01:03:22,604 --> 01:03:25,130
The day I stayed with Tom was like
a dream

656
01:03:25,273 --> 01:03:26,832
on the island-"on the boat

657
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,876
He was so kind-"so gentle

658
01:03:30,912 --> 01:03:33,347
No man ever gave me so much pleasure

659
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:34,744
I' m a fool

660
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:38,216
I should go and find him---
and ask for his forgiveness

661
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:44,020
But I have my pride-"bastard

662
01:03:50,198 --> 01:03:51,563
Why did he do it?

663
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,929
It' s hard to believe

664
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:56,862
I shouldn' t let him hear this tape
I made

665
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:58,302
---this is the most sacred shrine
in Greece"-

666
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,771
ancient zero---

667
01:03:59,874 --> 01:04:01,865
I think he' d have understood me better

668
01:04:02,043 --> 01:04:05,274
It now turns out to be that I set him
in my trap

669
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:06,881
---the ancient theatre of liberty"-

670
01:04:07,048 --> 01:04:08,538
Here on my left is Yagora architecture

671
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:10,276
remarkably well preserved - --

672
01:04:10,452 --> 01:04:11,851
one of the warmest ancient

673
01:04:11,986 --> 01:04:13,954
Greek life before Christ"-

674
01:04:14,122 --> 01:04:14,953
Come on...

675
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,650
Well, few days and nights I' ll be okay

676
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:19,385
Over 3,000 years everywhere

677
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:20,790
you've seen the whole island were---

678
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:22,488
Good, face this way please

679
01:04:25,266 --> 01:04:26,893
---the love story inevitably turns out

680
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:28,298
to be 'Never On Sunday'

681
01:04:28,436 --> 01:04:30,302
At least it was fun on the last day

682
01:04:30,438 --> 01:04:32,839
None would go banana in that regard

683
01:04:32,974 --> 01:04:34,271
Once more---flat---wider---

684
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:35,740
that' s your profile

685
01:04:35,844 --> 01:04:39,576
There we got it-"hold it---just like that

686
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:44,752
Once more-"yeah-"that, s great

687
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,219
Would I buck you if I watch?

688
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:51,692
Huh?

689
01:04:56,264 --> 01:04:58,028
My name is Beatrice

690
01:04:58,366 --> 01:04:59,561
Hi---Bernie

691
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:01,133
Hey, what' s the matter with you?

692
01:05:01,336 --> 01:05:03,031
I thought we were here for work

693
01:05:03,171 --> 01:05:04,400
You shut up-"it, s finished

694
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:07,064
Roy, tell her
change her clothes please

695
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:15,844
I get trouble-"you know that

696
01:05:15,984 --> 01:05:16,849
No shit

697
01:05:17,018 --> 01:05:18,679
I' ve been dumped by a guy I love

698
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:19,810
I' m looking for a good way out

699
01:05:20,622 --> 01:05:22,147
He' s practically a straight guy---

700
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,257
but now I hate him

701
01:05:23,391 --> 01:05:24,051
Why?

702
01:05:24,192 --> 01:05:24,920
What did you do?

703
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:26,660
Who with?

704
01:05:26,828 --> 01:05:29,729
With a Greek guy-"I made love to him

705
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:31,457
But it' s to prove that Tom wasn' t real

706
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:32,566
and I wasn' twrong

707
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:34,597
Did I shock you?

708
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,237
Oh, no---surely

709
01:05:36,404 --> 01:05:38,771
And you---never been in love with you?

710
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:44,242
How would you like to work with me?

711
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:46,708
Sure, I might like that

712
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:48,078
Will you present nude?

713
01:05:48,183 --> 01:05:48,945
Huh?

714
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,551
You' re shy, aren' t you?

715
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:52,416
I'm not shy at all

716
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:05,463
You like it?

717
01:06:09,337 --> 01:06:10,566
Do you mind if I stay with you---

718
01:06:10,672 --> 01:06:11,935
I work for free

719
01:06:12,106 --> 01:06:14,404
Tom took all the money when he left and
I' m broke

720
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:15,475
Do as you like

721
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,839
But I' m warning---it' <i>s</i> a hard day

722
01:06:17,045 --> 01:06:18,103
That' ll be okay

723
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:19,374
He has got a sister

724
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:21,677
His sister works on the states
of the hotel

725
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:23,443
That means we won' t get pay expenses

726
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:24,984
What you're doing is already overpaid

727
01:06:25,086 --> 01:06:26,247
Thanks a lot

728
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:29,814
That' s good-"only relax-"relax a little

729
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,153
Okay, Beatrice

730
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:33,761
You too, Amanda"-
try and lie on your thigh

731
01:06:34,295 --> 01:06:35,888
Good - --now move closer together

732
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:38,660
Yeah, just like that, right-"very good

733
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:39,959
Now, I' ll get some close-ups

734
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:41,160
Oh...

735
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,101
Hold it"-

736
01:06:44,405 --> 01:06:46,430
Get your hair up, Amanda"-

737
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:48,770
Qet UP"-good

738
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:51,741
Play the pose-"good

739
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:53,408
You know it' s marvelous

740
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:54,344
with the photographer

741
01:06:54,516 --> 01:06:55,449
You think so?

742
01:06:55,617 --> 01:06:57,676
He' s a little too topsy with almighty

743
01:06:57,886 --> 01:06:58,751
You think so?

744
01:06:58,887 --> 01:07:00,082
Good-"not that all

745
01:07:00,255 --> 01:07:02,087
We' ll get few more shots in the water"-
come on

746
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,224
You don' t like cameraman, is that it' s?

747
01:07:04,325 --> 01:07:05,554
I do really, I mean it

748
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:07,661
And I' ll follow you

749
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,589
He' s pathetic

750
01:07:11,132 --> 01:07:12,531
Okay now-"Amanda, turn to the side

751
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,396
and Beatrice, you turn to a full profile

752
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:17,071
You mean a real flap?

753
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:19,299
He' s as quick as a treat of a duck

754
01:07:19,407 --> 01:07:21,398
He should get it up as it should

755
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:24,443
Beatrice, return your back to me-"right

756
01:07:25,013 --> 01:07:26,242
Alrightmthat' s it for the day

757
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:27,678
Take a swim or something

758
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:29,374
You can get sick of the damn sun

759
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:31,246
Save your expenses-"you don' t need soap

760
01:07:31,686 --> 01:07:33,848
No man can complete for a second

761
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:35,786
You want to turn him on?

762
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:36,721
If you're willing"-

763
01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:37,814
So aml

764
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:51,697
Do you think he' s watching us?

765
01:08:54,235 --> 01:08:55,725
Hm...

766
01:08:59,107 --> 01:09:00,165
Come on

767
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:54,953
I got the impression he' s ready

768
01:10:55,089 --> 01:10:56,818
I won' t be surprised

769
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,521
I won' t really think she can make it

770
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:05,996
Hold me tight

771
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:07,757
No way she' ll make it

772
01:11:07,902 --> 01:11:08,960
No way

773
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:20,038
You know what you really want?

774
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:24,042
First is this Tom---then is the Greek

775
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:25,447
Could be a lesbian

776
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:28,482
I' m disappointed it' s normal

777
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:29,488
What I want is love

778
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,580
However, I can make it

779
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:32,590
You really think you can make it
with her, don' t you?

780
01:11:34,228 --> 01:11:34,990
Why not?

781
01:11:35,096 --> 01:11:37,064
You seem available by now

782
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:39,366
May I?

783
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:09,755
What?

784
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:13,616
Let me go

785
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:14,489
Good"-

786
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:15,619
Good fight"-

787
01:13:15,763 --> 01:13:21,668
Slop it...

788
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,833
Lousy creep"-

789
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:30,478
The only way he gets it up is by the
flash light

790
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:34,241
Tom was straight-HI' m a real bummer

791
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:36,981
Where is Tom?

792
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:38,448
He shouldn' t have gone

793
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:39,781
You' re the only one

794
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:41,013
Who does it for me?

795
01:13:41,856 --> 01:13:44,951
What I do is this stupid thing
like that to be stolen

796
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,319
But I guess I have to

797
01:13:49,664 --> 01:13:52,326
Why I just call this island off?

798
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:14,811
Thank you

799
01:14:23,898 --> 01:14:24,660
Good morning

or a large suite

802
01:14:35,843 --> 01:14:37,402
Does it say anything?

803
01:14:37,545 --> 01:14:39,445
It does to me, Miss

804
01:14:43,684 --> 01:14:45,379
I send the room boy immediately

805
01:14:45,519 --> 01:14:47,681
Don't bother-"I have just one bag

806
01:15:36,303 --> 01:15:37,099
Good morning

807

And more...

941
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:13,687
Can I take a bath?

942
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:14,787
Sure, why not?

943
01:24:14,955 --> 01:24:16,252
There' s a bathroom upstairs

944
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,449
Don't put too much oil, Manico

945
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:20,519
Anything else?

946
01:24:20,627 --> 01:24:22,095
For the moment that' ll be all

947
01:24:26,533 --> 01:24:27,762
Hi,there---

948
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:32,966
Do I know you?

949
01:24:33,206 --> 01:24:34,765
Why you ask silly question?

950
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:36,535
Did you hear me ask who you' re?

951
01:24:36,677 --> 01:24:37,576
No, but"-

952
01:24:37,678 --> 01:24:39,339
Is it okay if I share the water?

953
01:24:39,513 --> 01:24:40,173
What?

954
01:24:40,347 --> 01:24:41,041
Do you mind?

955
01:24:41,848 --> 01:24:42,872
No

956
01:24:51,725 --> 01:24:52,658
Who is the girl?

957
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:53,384
Huh?

958
01:24:53,694 --> 01:24:55,253
The girl in his bed

959
01:24:55,395 --> 01:24:56,191
What girl in what bed?

960
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:57,456
The bitch with Tom

961
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,999
His girl friend-"you know Tom?

962
01:25:00,067 --> 01:25:01,228
I should-"I do

963
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:03,030
I' m his fiance

964
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:16,083
It' s good

965
01:25:17,084 --> 01:25:18,552
Will you pass me the soap?

966
01:25:21,922 --> 01:25:23,048
Thanks

967
01:25:24,191 --> 01:25:26,250
Have been together very long?

968
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,154
Who?

969
01:25:27,327 --> 01:25:29,159
Tom and the girl he had in bed

970
01:25:29,329 --> 01:25:31,127
Half a month, I guess

971
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,663
It' s not real then

972
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:34,267
I understand how you feel

973
01:25:34,401 --> 01:25:35,869
I don' t think that matters much

974
01:25:36,003 --> 01:25:37,300
Don't you care him with other girl?

975
01:25:37,704 --> 01:25:39,365
You want to wash my back?

976
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:40,702
Okay

977
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,609
Be careful when you wash my bottom"-

978
01:25:48,715 --> 01:25:50,012
it' s fragile

979
01:25:54,388 --> 01:25:55,253
Oh, come on...

980
01:25:55,389 --> 01:25:56,754
Wash-"I don' tfeel a thing

981
01:25:58,692 --> 01:26:00,023
lhOpe...

982
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,026
Let me show you-"turn around

983
01:26:04,598 --> 01:26:10,332
The bottom-"now how do you feel?

984
01:26:10,637 --> 01:26:11,570
Nice

985
01:26:11,772 --> 01:26:13,331
Next of kin turns on, right?

986
01:26:13,507 --> 01:26:14,497
Shall I do the front?

987
01:26:14,641 --> 01:26:15,369
Really?

988
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:16,635
You think I play you off?

989
01:26:16,777 --> 01:26:18,905
Turn aroundmyou' re not afraid?

990
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:20,741
Gosh, no-"allow me---only not used to

991
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:24,477
Oh, so tiny"-

992
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:26,776
Is this something you always laugh at?

993
01:26:26,953 --> 01:26:28,785
No, we can fix that

994
01:26:29,156 --> 01:26:31,853
Why should I have to leave
for that bitch?

995
01:26:31,992 --> 01:26:33,858
Don't give me a hard time

996
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:35,658
We haven' t finished---

997
01:26:35,796 --> 01:26:36,854
What are you doing?

998
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,561
Don t go away

999
01:26:42,102 --> 01:26:43,365
Is that all it is?

1000
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:45,062
We have a problem now

1001
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:46,399
You got to hang on with it---

1002
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,907
or try it yourself- --bye

1003
01:26:54,114 --> 01:26:56,173
Did Tom split too?

1004
01:26:58,685 --> 01:27:00,551
Answer me-"did Tom split it gone?

1005
01:27:02,322 --> 01:27:04,188
Well, what' s the marvel"-
you've been funny

1006
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:06,258
Why you ask a silly question?

1007
01:27:10,964 --> 01:27:13,160
I hope she didn't go mad

1008
01:27:13,533 --> 01:27:15,160
She surely did

1009
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:17,565
Would you console her?

1010
01:27:17,771 --> 01:27:19,170
Huh?

1011
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,680
Glad to see me?

1012
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:33,747
What do you think?

1013
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:37,584
Why did you leave me alone so long?

1014
01:27:37,724 --> 01:27:39,158
You were not exactly alone

1015
01:27:39,292 --> 01:27:41,659
Getting company is nothing to me---

1016
01:27:41,795 --> 01:27:43,889
only one time-"like you

1017
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,192
ls one girl enough for you?

1018
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:48,199
It depends who she is

1019
01:27:48,502 --> 01:27:49,936
Stupid

1020
01:27:54,941 --> 01:27:56,909
Man, why didn't you pick her up?

1021
01:27:57,844 --> 01:27:58,936
Either

1022
01:27:59,146 --> 01:28:00,773
Oh, I need a drink

1023
01:28:02,482 --> 01:28:04,541
I doubt if you need more than that

1024
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:30,339
Why you return?

1025
01:28:30,544 --> 01:28:31,943
Well, maybe I felt like you

1026
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:33,746
If I were in love,

1027
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,177
I' d send roses

1028
01:28:35,382 --> 01:28:36,872
I have a lot to learn

1029
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:38,078
Start now

1030
01:28:38,218 --> 01:28:39,049
There' s a rose on the table

1031
01:28:39,186 --> 01:28:40,483
That' s for you

1032
01:28:45,392 --> 01:28:48,157
For you is white-"it tells you something

1033
01:28:48,295 --> 01:28:50,093
It tells me I' ve been stupid

1034
01:28:51,031 --> 01:28:55,093
You' re right-"only no more than I

1035
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:00,002
So, what now?

1036
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:04,337
So, you don' t know?

1037
01:29:05,478 --> 01:29:07,640
You' re all that I want

1038
01:29:18,558 --> 01:29:21,152
I' m so happy back with you, Tom

1039
01:29:25,065 --> 01:29:27,193
We can do it another time

1040
01:29:27,767 --> 01:29:30,065
We should be together, right?
