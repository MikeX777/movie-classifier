National Athem. Please rise.

7
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:08,362
These visuals are
from the only 1 950's surviving copy of

8
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:15,943
the Republic of China's National Anthem

9
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:27,045
which was screened in every cinema
before every film in Taiwan.

10
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:33,787
The audio is a medley of sound
from that era including

11
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:40,027
speeches by Generalismo Chiang Kai Shek,
news broadcasts,

12
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:49,406
radio commercials and talk shows.

13
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:54,346
After the 1 949 revolution in China,

14
00:01:54,551 --> 00:02:02,219
Chiang Kai Shek took his army and people
from Mainland China to Taiwan

15
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:10,924
with the dream that one day they would
defeat the Communists and return home.

16
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:16,128
The government proceeded to imposed
martial law on the island.

17
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:22,278
But for the children of the Mainlanders,
life remained a paradise.

18
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,280
Please sit

19
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:31,420
Taiwan 1954

20
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:38,022
At that time,
"Communist" is the other name for Terror.

21
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:53,974
Crystal Rock Primary School,
near an air force base in Central Taiwan

22
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:08,118
What are you looking at?

23
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:09,383
That is my father's jet.

24
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:10,992
No, that's my father's jet.

25
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:14,088
My dad said your dad is just a co-pilot.

26
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:14,592
My father said,

27
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:16,663
your dad is a drunkard.

28
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,697
Forget it, our dads are small potatoes.

29
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:23,031
Rainbow's father is the General.

30
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,730
He is the The Godfather.

31
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:26,572
That is my father's jet.

32
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:28,573
No, that is my father's jet.

33
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:29,938
Where is it?

34
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:32,979
The prince...

35
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,511
dropped his first tear.

36
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:40,312
He felt he didn't know his people.

37
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:41,956
Rainbow, what are you reading?

38
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:45,124

Written & Directed by Yonfan

49
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,026
The story begins

50
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,453
The handsome prince and his princess...

51
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:04,660
They finally live happily ever after.

52
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,834
They bring their lovely daughters

53
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:12,273
to this beautiful island named Formosa.

54
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:16,039
They intended to build a happy family,

55
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,474
seeking a fairy...

56
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:22,874
tale-like life,

57
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,687
However...

58
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:36,288
"Story of the children"

59
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:42,628
"Master Qiu"

60
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:44,466
This statue David is...

61
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:47,302
by a very famous ltalian artist.

62
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,745
When we draw this picture,

63
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,983
other than his handsome face,

64
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,647
you must notice his curly hair, too.

65
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,784
I think Mr.Qiu looks better than David.

66
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,790
Rainbow Liu,

67
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:05,159
what are you laughing at?

68
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,295
Nothing

69
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:11,091
She said you more handsome than David.

70
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:14,990
Sun Xiao-Zhou

71
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,064
Show me your drawing.

72
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:30,642
This is the statue of David in her mind.

73
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,645
Drawing is important to express oneself.

74
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:37,318
It doesn't have to be real nor unreal.

75
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:40,682
Drawing is to express our thinking.

76
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,958
To liberate our thoughts on paper
and by colors.

77
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,554
Do you get it?

78
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,729
Yes.

79
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,430
Ok, class is finished.

80
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:11,815
When do you think...

81
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:13,616
you can return home?

82
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:17,619
I don't know.

83
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,394
I have been here for many years.

84
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:20,823
How is your home town?

85
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:26,761
I hope we can return soon.

86
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:30,838
How is your novel coming along?

87
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:33,599
So-so; I haven't found the heroine.

88
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:40,105
- Mr. Qiu... - Hi, come in.

89
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:42,815
Come on, sit on the bed.

90
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:47,514
What are you going to tell me?

91
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:51,424
Sir, I want to marry you when I grow up.

92
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,897
Silly kid, don't say that.

93
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,024
I am old enough to be your father

94
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,803
you're like my father.
Since I can't marry my father,

95
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:03,302
I want to marry you.

96
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,870
Do you also want to marry me?

97
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:06,335
I don't want to marry you.

98
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:17,619
Sir, where are you going to?

99
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:22,121
I am going to the cliff to paint.

100
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,449
I want to go too.

101
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:31,061
Ok, but you have to tell your family.

102
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,495
I can just tell my sister before I go.

103
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:09,929
Sir...

104
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,403
It's so windy, how can we draw here?

105
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:14,867
If you stay calm, you can draw anywhere.

106
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:20,471
It's so beautiful here,

107
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:23,208
why hasn't anyone taken me before?

108
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:27,482
This is a restricted zone,
no one is allowed to come here.

109
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:29,955
But why can we come here today?

110
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,519
Because...we are artists.

111
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:38,199
Wow, artists are great!

112
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:39,800
That's right.

113
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,130
Zhou, look!

114
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,433
How beautiful is the ocean!

115
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:47,301
You can put it in the painting.

116
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,602
Ok!

117
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:50,340
Zhou!

118
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:54,848
Where are you? Zhou!

119
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,110
- Zhou!
- Mom, come here, I am right here!

120
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,878
Zhou, how can you come here?

121
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,754
Mr Qiu, you've gone too far!

122
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,516
This is a restricted zone!

123
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:04,324
I know,

124
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,085
I just want her to see the ocean.

125
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:07,387
Let's go!

126
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:08,359
I'll stay a bit longer.

127
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:10,031
I am inspired.

128
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,142
Why did you come here with Mr. Qiu?

129
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,477
You can get killed by coming here.

130
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:14,896
- Freeze! - Wait...

131
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:18,997
Wait...

132
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,260
Wait!

133
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,434
This is the military zone.

134
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:22,598
I suspect you're...

135
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:24,796
spying on naval defence.

136
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:26,798
I want to arrest you as "Communist Spy".

137
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,033
I am an artist, not a spy.

138
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:29,268
Nonsense artist, Take him away!

139
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,208
- Go. - Let me go!

140
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:34,848
Take him away...

141
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,479
- Move on! Move! - Let me go!

142
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:27,095
Good morning, Miss Xie.

143
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:28,634
Good morning, class.

144
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,597
Painting is a kind of human behavior,

145
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:35,477
we must seek truth from facts.

146
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,645
Today, the subject is watermelon.

147
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,480
Don't look down on this watermelon...

148
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:42,981
Thus Mr Qiu

149
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:47,815
disappeared from the School forever...

150
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:51,118
In Zhou's memory,

151
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,586
this is the beginning of missing...

152
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,593
the coolness of the wind,

153
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,857
the beauty of the sunset...

154
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,432
the melancholy of the man...

155
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:05,701
the vanishing innocence of her childhood.

156
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:24,957
Sis, what is 8 times 22?

157
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:27,120
176

158
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,153
How come you're so good at Math?

159
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:32,225
Because I like our Math teacher.

160
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,727
I like master Qiu. But he left us.

161
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,772
Li

162
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:48,546
I made 1 00 dumplings for Mrs Zhang.

163
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,378
Can you bring them to her later?

164
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:51,416
Sure.

165
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:03,596
Tell her not to let them overnight.

166
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,667
Have you finished your homework?

167
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:11,032
Yes.

168
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:13,036
So, let's go to pick up Dad.

169
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:14,436
All right

170
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:19,107
Mom, I'lll go first.

171
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:21,681
Zhou, slow down.

172
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,181
All right.

173
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:25,712
Good Afternoon.

174
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:31,957
- Mrs Sun - How are you?

175
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,059
Hi, Li.

176
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:34,388
Li, greet your auntie.

177
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:37,757
What do you have for dinner?

178
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,026
Dumplings!

179
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,733
Oh, that's what you're good at.

180
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,269
I must learn it from you.

181
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:47,203
Little ball on the floor,

182
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:50,274
flowers count twenty one,

183
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:53,682
256, 257

184
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,883
28, 29, 31

185
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:02,016
I feel nervous every day at this time.

186
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,322
I just worry that Han-Sun is not coming.

187
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:19,068
Nonsense! Why think this way?

188
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,335
Han-Sun is a pilot, he is great!

189
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,297
Dad is back! Dad is back!

190
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,553
Dad, I want to see the sunset.

191
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:13,161
All right.

192
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,494
I made a special fish dish...

193
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:17,723
for tonight.

194
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:20,998
Isn't Ke-Qiang coming with you?

195
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:25,266
I almost forgot him!

196
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:32,878
Ke-Qiang is Uncle Ding to the kids.

197
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,408
He has a scar on his face
because of a fire.

198
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:38,177
It was scary to the children
when they were little.

199
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:42,219
Dad said never judge anyone
by his appearance.

200
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:46,359
Ding's scar was a result of saving someone
from the fire.

201
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:50,295
You made so many dishes in no time.

202
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:52,157
Come on,

203
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:55,166
try this dumpling with turnip.

204
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:00,465
There is a party next week at the camp.

205
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:03,338
We are short of one musical item.

206
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,338
I'd like Ding to play violin.

207
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,874
Ping, what would you say?

208
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,108
Good!

209
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,720
Haven't heard Ding's violin for a while.

210
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:15,388
Uncle Ding plays violin?

211
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:19,860
Dad and Uncle Ding are great musicians.

212
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:22,391
One plays accordion & one plays violin.

213
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,532
With their handsome uniforms,

214
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,869
they charmed so many girls.

215
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:29,538
You girls of the Qing-ling School choir,

216
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:29,965
in those days,

217
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,867
you enchanted many of us.

218
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,006
You boys...

219
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:37,371
only paid attention to Ou-Yang.

220
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,978
You never notice me.

221
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:42,580
Come on! In the end,

222
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:44,551
I married you, right.

223
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,522
- What'd you say, Ding? - That's right.

224
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,949
Well, from now on, Zhou and Li,

225
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,821
you follow your dad and Uncle Ding.

226
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:53,790
One plays violin...

227
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,520
& the other accordion.

228
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:56,457
Ok,

229
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:57,723
I like Dad's...

230
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,662
"Lonely Accordion Player"

231
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,337
That is the first song I learned.

232
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:07,937
Come on, Ding, have some more.

233
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:09,035
Thank you.

234
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:11,404
Don't be shy, this is your home as well!

235
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,382
How are the dumplings?

236
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,016
Han-Sun,

237
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:25,858
your music is too Eastern European.

238
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:27,486
Better change your style.

239
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,223
I like...

240
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,994
the Slavic romanticism.

241
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:37,733
I don't think that is a problem.

242
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:45,612
Is your violin still with you?

243
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:46,906
Yes, it is.

244
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:48,549
So, better get more practice.

245
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,142
All right.

246
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:52,145
Have some noodles?

247
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:08,963
See you.

248
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:10,263
Take care.

249
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,270
Be careful!

250
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:19,170
Why did you mention Ou-Yang?

251
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:22,978
You did it yourself.

252
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:26,615
Now I regret telling you that we met.

253
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,117
Come on, it's history.

254
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:44,029
"Two months ago,
Parents' Day at Crystal Rock Primary."

255
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:53,572
You brought all your furnitures...

256
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:55,773
from Shanghai?

257
00:21:57,353 --> 00:22:00,720
Can we visit...

258
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:02,413
your house sometime?

259
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:04,148
Mrs Sun, what do you think?

260
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,959
Oh, yes...

261
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:08,286
You stay here for a while.

262
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:15,767
Sorry. Can you take care of Rainbow?

263
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:17,902
- Sure! - Thank you.

264
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:19,489
You're back!

265
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:31,337
You're cleaning up, huh?

266
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,201
Where have you been?

267
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,151
Let me roll you a cigarette, ok?

268
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:53,722
All right.

269
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,367
What's up?

270
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,900
I'll cook Lion's Head meat balls tonight.

271
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,172
I bought Five Flower Pork.

272
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:13,679
Let's go inside.

273
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:19,010
Baiguan will sing in the Air Force Club.

274
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:21,549
Let's go to Taipei, next week.

275
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:23,156
Sounds great!

276
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:24,723
We haven't been there for a long time.

277
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:27,488
We can do some shopping.

278
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:39,337
Today at Parents Day.

279
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:42,308
I bumped into Ou-Yang.

280
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:50,148
So, she also lives here!

281
00:25:52,187 --> 00:25:54,087
No wonder you are lost.

282
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:56,751
You're so bad!

283
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,126
As first, I thought you were after her.

284
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,593
And I thought you felt for Ding.

285
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:09,793
That is not possible!

286
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,369
I love only you.

287
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:25,978
Ou-Yang married General Liu.

288
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:29,981
Her daughter is the classmate of Zhou.

289
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,327
Perhaps,

290
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:38,861
we can get together sometime.

291
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:44,197
I think it's quite difficult.

292
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,007
We are home now.

293
00:27:04,926 --> 00:27:06,553
It smells great!

294
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,906
Hurry up, line up, kids...

295
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:32,681
Good morning class.

296
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:35,990
Good morning, Miss.

297
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:40,856
Lin Xiao-Bi,

298
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:42,994
why are you standing here?

299
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:44,324
I am being punished.

300
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,893
Why?

301
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:47,898
Because I refuse to drink skim milk.

302
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:50,594
Why don't you drink skim milk?

303
00:27:50,872 --> 00:27:52,999
It's horrible, only poor people drink it.

304
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:54,606
I only take high class things.

305
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:00,676
Kids,

306
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:04,845
you know the story behind skim milk?

307
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,017
It is a sign of the friendship
between American & us.

308
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,958
You must know that other than us

309
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,150
only those who go to Sunday school
can drink it.

310
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:14,886
Ordinary people hardly get the chance.

311
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:17,892
Since you're children of the Air Force.

312
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,757
You can drink it daily,

313
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:20,729
get it?

314
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:22,904
Yes, Miss.

315
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:26,072
So, drink it without hesitation.

316
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:30,937
If not, Uncle Sam will say...

317
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:34,172
the China kids are not behaving.

318
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:36,180
Yes.

319
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:38,752
Come on, be quick.

320
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:40,578
It's almost finished.

321
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:41,551
Finished by you?

322
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:45,750
I mean the whole bucket of milk.

323
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:49,096
Does it taste good?

324
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:52,132
I... I really wonder.

325
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:55,797
See, put in a piece of Black Sugar,

326
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,665
Stir it, it tastes sweet.

327
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:59,966
It looks like chocolate.

328
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:03,277
Wow, chocolate! It's classy!

329
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:05,446
Rainbow Liu is so generous.

330
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:08,776
Shake it, then the taste comes out.

331
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:11,683
And the color is changing!

332
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:12,911
That's right.

333
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:13,911
Look,

334
00:29:14,122 --> 00:29:16,317
they all want Black Sugar from Rainbow.

335
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:18,920
Big deal!

336
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,564
Sun Xiao-Zhou

337
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:28,463
Do you want a piece of Black Sugar?

338
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,103
No.

339
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:38,139
Put the filling inside. Right,
then fold it.

340
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:40,876
Fold it.

341
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:46,953
Look, it's like this.

342
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:48,647
Zhou, watch carefully.

343
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:50,290
That's right, let mom teach you.

344
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,995
Coming.

345
00:30:06,374 --> 00:30:08,365
Hi, Ding, come in please.

346
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:10,042
No, thanks.

347
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:12,611
Sorry to trouble you with my laundry.

348
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:14,040
Don't mention it;

349
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,080
Li should be glad to do it.

350
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:17,813
Thank you.

351
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:19,178
Don't you want to come in?

352
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:20,919
No, I must leave now.

353
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:22,714
Take care.

354
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,251
See you later.

355
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:35,059
Li, some laundry from Uncle Ding.

356
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:47,170
How come it is like this?

357
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:00,856
Coming...

358
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:04,995
- Ding. - Ping, I am sorry.

359
00:31:08,203 --> 00:31:08,794
Uncle Ding.

360
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:15,502
Li, have you seen a paper note?

361
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:22,909
You mean this one?

362
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,783
Have you read it?

363
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:36,224
Did your mother read it?

364
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,138
Ding, what's the matter?

365
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:51,337
I am sorry, Ping.

366
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,821
Dad, charge up!

367
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:21,436
Go... Hurry up!

368
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:55,039
Why don't you go in?

369
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:57,702
It's not so convenient.

370
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:00,110
This isn't your first time! Don't be shy?

371
00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:05,714
Thank you.

372
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,251
It doesn't matter, it's ok.

373
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,953
I will go home now.

374
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:19,794
Take care, Mrs Hu.

375
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,569
What's up?

376
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:30,071
Mr Hu was arrested.

377
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:33,241
They suspect he is a spy.
He is now under investigation.

378
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:40,015
Don't worry.

379
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:43,020
As long as he is innocent,

380
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:45,192
he will be fine.

381
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,553
But you never know what will happen!

382
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:54,597
Ding, you are from the Bureau
of Political Security.

383
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:56,603
Can you give Mr Hu a hand?

384
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:01,801
Ping,

385
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:05,237
don't get involved in this matter.

386
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:09,815
Let's go in first.

387
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:11,912
Let's talk inside.

388
00:34:57,932 --> 00:34:59,593
How's dad's accordion?

389
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,499
Do you want to learn?

390
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:05,195
No!

391
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:05,929
Do you want to know...

392
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:08,268
how he wooed me?

393
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:13,707
Your father took me to his plane.

394
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:16,679
It was a beautiful morning.

395
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:18,211
We went to the airport.

396
00:35:18,486 --> 00:35:20,477
I said "How can it be?

397
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:21,712
You're breaking the rules."

398
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:23,813
He said "Never mind,"

399
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,993
Each pilot can break the rules 3 times.

400
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:32,094
So, the first time was with me.

401
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:33,363
On that day,

402
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:37,334
he flew very slow,

403
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:40,133
we saw all the houses,

404
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:43,833
the people and the animals.

405
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:46,804
They are all under our feet.

406
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:48,975
I could even...

407
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:50,845
see your grandparents.

408
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,985
How can I not help falling in love?

409
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,250
How about the second time?

410
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:58,789
Oh, it was for your sister Li.

411
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:00,620
How come I don't remember?

412
00:36:01,229 --> 00:36:03,060
I want the third time?

413
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:04,121
If there is a third,

414
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:06,163
your father will never be allowed to fly!

415
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:08,701
Never be allowed to fly again...

416
00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:15,876
Line up, one by one.

417
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:16,869
Kid, you should line up.

418
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,511
Time for skim milk!

419
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:26,443
How come you have such a big piece
of Black Sugar!

420
00:36:27,922 --> 00:36:28,946
Father gave that to me.

421
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:05,483
Zhou, do you have Black Sugar too?

422
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:08,286
Keep yours,

423
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,494
try mine first.

424
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,066
Take a seat.

425
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:17,629
Thank you.

426
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:18,835
Welcome.

427
00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:38,585
Hurry up!

428
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,297
Is Sun Han-Sun here?

429
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:52,169
Yes.

430
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,632
We'll take you to the Commander's office.
You are now under arrest for spying.

431
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,507
Have you got it wrong?

432
00:37:57,779 --> 00:37:59,542
This is the warrant.

433
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,185
Ping, I am fine.

434
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,452
I have been loyal to the country,

435
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,718
I did nothing wrong.

436
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:19,558
I will be fine.

437
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:23,997
I will follow you.

438
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,569
Take him away.

439
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:30,476
Han-Sun!

440
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:39,848
Are you Jin Wen-Ping?

441
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:42,345
Yes.

442
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:44,520
You're accused of being pro-Communist.

443
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:47,018
We'll take you into custody.

444
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:48,424
Take her away.

445
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:54,500
Search the house.

446
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:55,760
Yes.

447
00:38:56,871 --> 00:39:00,136
The sun will rise tomorrow.

448
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:03,799
The flowers will bloom next year, too.

449
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:07,343
But the beautiful bird flies
and never returns.

450
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:10,016
Zhou, Li, come on, follow me.

451
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:14,851
My little bird of youth will never return.

452
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:16,319
Zhou, Li,

453
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:17,947
something happened to your family.

454
00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:58,464
Give way...

455
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,208
Search again!

456
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,111
Search every inch of it.

457
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,681
Ding.

458
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:19,219
Yes.

459
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,988
Little girl, look

460
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:26,985
We didn't take away anything.

461
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:28,553
Remember that.

462
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:30,794
Ding,

463
00:40:31,766 --> 00:40:35,258
Iet them sign on the warrant.

464
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,960
Then, tell the girls that...

465
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:40,633
their parents will be gone for a while.

466
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:48,946
And this place...
it will be sealed tomorrow.

467
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,785
Ask the neighbors to take care of them.

468
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,046
Yes, sir.

469
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:57,718
All right, let's go.

470
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:43,999
I'll take you...

471
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:46,571
to Uncle Kou's home.

472
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:49,899
They'll take care both of you.

473
00:41:57,451 --> 00:41:59,476
I want daddy's accordion.

474
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:02,113
Don't take anything useless.

475
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,159
You will stop going to school
for the time being.

476
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,234
Help Auntie Kou to do some chores.

477
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:19,195
Come with me now.

478
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:22,806
You'll be back.

479
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:29,410
Li,

480
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:31,749
are the lunch boxes ready yet?

481
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:33,113
Yes, they are ready.

482
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:36,120
- Wake Ah-Lun up. - He is dressing.

483
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:39,755
Take care of the baby while I am out.

484
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:40,928
Yes.

485
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:44,131
Come on, be a good girl.

486
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:45,829
Take care.

487
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:52,501
Ah-Lun, get up for breakfast.

488
00:42:53,975 --> 00:42:55,306
Girls,

489
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,770
- did you sleep well? - All right.

490
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:00,247
Everyday is the same, dressing up...

491
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:02,643
and eating breakfast.

492
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,019
You're lazy!

493
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,414
Why don't you eat breakfast?

494
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:08,683
It will help you grow tall...

495
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:11,255
- and strong. - I am tall enough.

496
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:12,448
You are not!

497
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:13,860
Come on, eating more...

498
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,086
will help you become smart.

499
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:17,594
Come on, eat your breakfast now.

500
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:21,197
Mom, I want Lion's Head meat balls
tonight.

501
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:24,768
- Lion's Head again?
- You naughty boy!

502
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:26,439
Li is not your maid.

503
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:28,575
Lion's Head is delicious
but you can't have it everyday.

504
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:31,643
This is a difficult time.
We should be thrifty.

505
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:32,710
Just let him eat what he likes,

506
00:43:32,913 --> 00:43:35,211
what a nag!

507
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:40,410
Come on, let's have breakfast.

508
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:43,119
You look beautiful!

509
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,490
Because of their help.

510
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,217
So I will have a break,

511
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:48,622
I am going to play mahjong.

512
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,058
Who is coming this early?

513
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:52,493
Who is it?

514
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:01,332
Are the Sun sisters...

515
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:03,273
Iiving here?

516
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:04,872
Yes, they are.

517
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:06,645
I am the driver of General Liu.

518
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:09,609
Ms Liu would like to bring them a gift.

519
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:39,431
Stay where you are. Wait right here.

520
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:46,342
Sign this.

521
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,053
The meeting begins.

522
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,365
Dad, I miss you,

523
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:18,238
are you going to abandon us?

524
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:23,181
Don't be silly! I will never abandon you.

525
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:28,351
Are you taking good care of your sister?

526
00:46:28,556 --> 00:46:29,079
Yes!

527
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:32,348
Good! How is your grade in Math?

528
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,050
I haven't got it yet.

529
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:35,560
Haven't got it...

530
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:44,999
Wait here for me,

531
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,231
I have to talk to Uncle Ding.

532
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:38,453
I was accused of flying to
the Communist Zone during the war.

533
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:54,305
You knew my purpose is going there.

534
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,905
I just wanted to bring back Li with me.

535
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:16,958
They are accusing me of treason.

536
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:23,699
But the people I saw,

537
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:27,297
the things I did,

538
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:31,000
you were with me all that time.

539
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:38,809
You knew what I said, what I did.

540
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:49,123
You witness it all.

541
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:09,613
Help me!

542
00:49:29,837 --> 00:49:33,170
"General Liu"

543
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,366
Why was he arrested?

544
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:37,069
Treason, Sir.

545
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,335
He is unyielding.

546
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:46,616
Who are these girls?

547
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:49,015
His daughters.

548
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:52,883
Pity!

549
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:08,508
Mom.

550
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:10,102
Zhou.

551
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,070
Mom...

552
00:50:18,552 --> 00:50:19,849
Ding.

553
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,318
Why did you take her along?

554
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:25,321
Hasn't she dragged us down enough?

555
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:27,751
Mom...

556
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:29,427
I am not your mom.

557
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:32,560
Because of you,

558
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,497
your dad snuck into the Communist zone

559
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:38,096
Because of you,

560
00:50:38,305 --> 00:50:40,773
he is now being accused of spying.

561
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,209
You're not born by me,
I do not deserve to be your mother.

562
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:50,316
And you do not deserve to be my daughter.

563
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:52,052
Mom...

564
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:53,612
Sis...

565
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:55,254
Mom...

566
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,288
Mom...

567
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:03,620
Li,

568
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:07,793
I am sorry...

569
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,195
Forgive mom.

570
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:21,874
Li then remembered...

571
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:26,016
she loved sitting under the big tree
at school...

572
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:29,784
always had the feeling that...

573
00:51:30,157 --> 00:51:33,957
why mother always treated her
better than her sister?

574
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:37,494
The reason is she was not born by her.

575
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:40,423
But, so what?

576
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,893
She has only one family, one sister.

577
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:01,844
Zhou...

578
00:52:02,556 --> 00:52:03,614
Let me take you to see your dad.

579
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:06,588
No, I am taking care of the baby girl.

580
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:09,592
Hurry up,
or you may never see your father again.

581
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:16,196
Kids, don't touch the car.

582
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:28,439
Are you Zhou and Li?

583
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,050
Auntie.

584
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:34,448
Let me take you to see your father.

585
00:53:17,664 --> 00:53:20,462
Madam, they were
just sent to the Dry River.

586
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:23,867
So, let's hurry there.

587
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:26,863
Madam, that's a forbidden place.

588
00:53:30,677 --> 00:53:32,872
Move on, I know what I am doing.

589
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:35,073
Yes, Madam.

590
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:13,443
Madam, here we are.

591
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:17,417
Zhang,

592
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:20,083
take them to see their father.

593
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:24,259
Promise me,

594
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:25,897
don't tell anyone that you've been here.

595
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:30,896
Zhang, be careful,
don't let others see them.

596
00:54:31,905 --> 00:54:33,463
Don't let the kids make a sound.

597
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:35,869
Yes, Madam.

598
00:54:41,415 --> 00:54:42,780
Come on, hurry up.

599
00:55:41,174 --> 00:55:42,698
Don't make any sound!

600
00:55:46,947 --> 00:55:49,279
Move faster,

601
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:53,712
hurry up...Come out and line up...

602
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,157
Hurry up! Move faster.

603
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,543
Hurry up! One by one!

604
00:56:29,656 --> 00:56:30,645
The verdict.

605
00:56:33,427 --> 00:56:38,888

order to spy on Taiwan.

609
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:49,933
You're accused of recruiting adherents,

610
00:56:50,243 --> 00:56:53,337
in the name of
the "New Democracy Youth League"

611
00:56:53,713 --> 00:56:55,704

612
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:57,577
Sentenced to death.

613
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:03,045
The accused Sun Han-Sun, male, aged 32.

614
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:06,890
A Captain of the 9th squadron
of the Air Force.

615
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:11,395
The verdict is...

616
00:57:12,165 --> 00:57:15,134
the accused sent out intelligence...

617
00:57:15,335 --> 00:57:16,233
to the Communists.

618
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:17,331
In 1 947,

619
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:20,301
he entered the Communist zone
in North China.

620
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:22,904
He intended to rebel the government
with the Communist.

621
00:57:24,077 --> 00:57:25,271
Sentenced to death.

622
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:29,243
Hurry up...

623
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:33,984
Escort the prisoners forward.

624
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:40,253
Give them wine.

625
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:52,597
Ready for execution!

626
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,762
Execute!

627
00:58:56,236 --> 00:58:58,227
4 x1 = 4, 4 x 2 = to 8,

628
00:58:58,538 --> 00:58:59,630
4 x 3 = 1 2,

629
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:00,737
a total of 1 2 people.

630
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:03,000
4 x1 = 4, 4 x 2 = to 8,

631
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,074
4 x 3 = 1 2,

632
00:59:04,277 --> 00:59:05,266
a total of 1 2 people.

633
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:16,645
Here are your favorites -

634
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,784
Lion's Head meat ball.

635
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:20,049
It is delicious!
You should get more!

636
01:00:20,253 --> 01:00:23,586
I want to buy a pair of new shoes.

637
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,724
You just bought one pair last year.

638
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:26,823
Why do you want a new one this year?

639
01:00:27,027 --> 01:00:28,688
I want them for the Speech Competition.

640
01:00:29,596 --> 01:00:30,927
Who told you to join the competition?

641
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:33,599
They say I can join,
only if I wear new shoes.

642
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:35,731
You're so stupid!

643
01:00:36,703 --> 01:00:37,670
Don't shout at him!

644
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:39,030
Zhou,

645
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,228
this is my home, not your home!

646
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,237
You'll eat me out of my home.

647
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,566
This is your home, not my home.

648
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:44,436
I don't like it here,

649
01:00:44,644 --> 01:00:46,202
I want my dad to shoot you to death.

650
01:00:46,646 --> 01:00:48,375
What's up with you? You want to go home?

651
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:49,513
I'll let Ding take you back home.

652
01:00:49,716 --> 01:00:51,377
Don't eat it...

653
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:52,016
if you don't want to!

654
01:00:52,218 --> 01:00:54,311
- You cheese-eating mouse!
- She is ridiculous,

655
01:00:54,521 --> 01:00:57,149
how dare you break my bowl?

656
01:00:57,357 --> 01:00:58,449
Go get Ding here!

657
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:15,801
Zhou finally saw the place
where Ding lives.

658
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:20,034
It is a mechanic warehouse
near the airport.

659
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:22,708
He lives alone.

660
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:27,316
All his secrets are kept in
that little room.

661
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:31,518
A giant Dr. Sun Yat-Sun painting...

662
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,357
Iook over them.

663
01:01:58,218 --> 01:01:59,344
Zhou.

664
01:02:00,453 --> 01:02:02,045
I'll take you back to school tomorrow.

665
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:03,517
Thank you, Uncle Ding.

666
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:06,425
However,

667
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:10,562
Zhou liked the changes.

668
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:13,891
Because, it gave her the chance.

669
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,967
To return to the school
where Master Qiu once taught.

670
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:22,501
Uncle Ding will take care of you.

671
01:02:29,716 --> 01:02:32,378
Try this piece of Black Sugar.

672
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:35,819
Why are you so nice to me?

673
01:02:36,022 --> 01:02:38,513
Because you didn't like me,
so I must be nice to you.

674
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:40,650
But I like you now.

675
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,350
So you don't have to be nice.

676
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,120
Then I must be even nicer to you.

677
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:46,525
Let's meet at the statue everyday...

678
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:47,791
before school.

679
01:02:48,034 --> 01:02:49,092
Sure!

680
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,642
Miss, you are home!

681
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:02,906
Hi!

682
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:05,744
Let me show you around.

683
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:18,491
Let's read.

684
01:03:24,537 --> 01:03:27,062
Long time ago in a far away kingdom.

685
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:31,073
A celebrating for the birth of Prince.

686
01:03:31,277 --> 01:03:34,178
The newborn prince was really cute

687
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,870
Why are you so cheerful?

688
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:38,447
What are you reading?

689
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:40,818
We are reading "Prince of Tears."

690
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:42,078
"Prince of Tears"?

691
01:03:43,423 --> 01:03:44,151
Zhou, do you like it?

692
01:03:44,357 --> 01:03:44,584
Yes.

693
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,089
She reads and she cries.

694
01:03:48,595 --> 01:03:49,653
Do you know...

695
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:52,589
why the prince got frozen.

696
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,531
And, why did he went blind?

697
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:55,792
I don't know.

698
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:59,896
Because he saw the injustice
and corruption of the world.

699
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,169
He wanted to change.

700
01:04:02,475 --> 01:04:04,136
But he had no way out.

701
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:08,576
So, he finally sacrificed himself.

702
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:13,716
Let me read you...

703
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,443
the part I like most.

704
01:04:14,654 --> 01:04:16,121
Ok.

705
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,658
Come on, sit closer.

706
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,191
Rainbow knows which part I like most,

707
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:22,918
right?

708
01:04:23,129 --> 01:04:24,391
Yes.

709
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:31,398
"Your Highness, please forgive us."

710
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:33,965
The poor people said to the prince.

711
01:04:35,675 --> 01:04:36,869
"Why?"

712
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:42,413
"Because we are poor, we are dirty,
we are an embarrassment to you."

713
01:04:43,616 --> 01:04:47,882
"lt is not your choice to be in poverty,

714
01:04:48,855 --> 01:04:50,618
it's the society that made you so."

715
01:04:52,692 --> 01:04:54,125
Rainbow's lives in

716
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:58,089
an old Japanese house.

717
01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:00,298
It was full of...

718
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,833
beautiful European furniture
and paintings.

719
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:08,032
General Liu is frugal
and conservative.

720
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:11,908
He believes the army could return
to China soon.

721
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:15,176
So he insists on letting
the garden go unattended.

722
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:18,612
But Madam Ou-Yang Liu...

723
01:05:18,818 --> 01:05:21,582
is an elegant Shanghai lady.

724
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:23,911
When she came to Taiwan,

725
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:26,451
Iike other high society people,

726
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:29,618
she took everything she loved with her.

727
01:05:31,564 --> 01:05:34,032
General Liu married late.

728
01:05:34,701 --> 01:05:37,431
However, their Shanghai wedding...

729
01:05:38,137 --> 01:05:42,096
was the talk of the town.

730
01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:49,480
- Good morning. - Good morning.

731
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,482
- Good morning, Zhou. - Good morning.

732
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:54,684
Zhou, why are you standing here?

733
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:56,184
I am waiting for Rainbow.

734
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:02,861
- I've been waiting for a long time.
- Let's go.

735
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:09,434
This is fun!

736
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:11,536
What a big picture of Dr. Sun Yat-Sun!

737
01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:15,265
Not like ours,
only a small one on the wall.

738
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:18,472
But Mom says Dr. Sun autographed it
for father.

739
01:06:18,945 --> 01:06:20,242
Rainbow, let's have a treasure hunt.

740
01:06:20,513 --> 01:06:21,070
Ok.

741
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,747
This is Uncle Ding's violin.

742
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:25,143
It's wonderful!

743
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:27,376
But I haven't heard him playing.

744
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:39,357
This is yours.

745
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:41,759
No!

746
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:49,671
Look, this is Uncle Ding's picture.

747
01:06:49,876 --> 01:06:51,070
Wow, very handsome.

748
01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:53,502
No way, my dad is more handsome.

749
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:54,578
I like your mother,

750
01:06:54,781 --> 01:06:56,578
telling me stories.

751
01:06:57,216 --> 01:06:59,116
Which story do you like most?

752
01:06:59,318 --> 01:06:59,875
The story of Qiu Jin.

753
01:07:00,086 --> 01:07:00,381
Me too.

754
01:07:00,586 --> 01:07:02,417
But those progressive women...

755
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:03,714
usually act like men.

756
01:07:03,923 --> 01:07:04,912
Your mom is progressive too.

757
01:07:05,124 --> 01:07:06,921
But she isn't like a man.

758
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:08,524
She wears trousers.

759
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:10,592
Your mom seems to know my mom.

760
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:12,995
No way, your mom is so high class!

761
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,428
Last time...

762
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:16,795
they met at Parent's Day.

763
01:07:17,003 --> 01:07:18,937
Your mom seemed avoiding my mom.

764
01:07:19,338 --> 01:07:21,135
No way, everyone likes your mom.

765
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,706
It's like everyone likes me, except you.

766
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,907
Don't be silly! I like you, too.

767
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:29,708
Let's be the best friends.

768
01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:30,914
Sure.

769
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,109
Uncle Ding,
whom are you writing a report on?

770
01:08:02,315 --> 01:08:03,748
Silly kid, mind your tongue.

771
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:06,847
I am not writing a report.

772
01:08:34,614 --> 01:08:35,774
Madam.

773
01:08:42,355 --> 01:08:43,617
General.

774
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:55,029
I'd like to reframe this picture...

775
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:57,031
of you with Generalismo Chiang.

776
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:01,770
Don't bother.

777
01:09:03,943 --> 01:09:07,310
It's just all a facade.

778
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:16,379
I looked in on the gardens.

779
01:09:17,256 --> 01:09:18,587
They seem to be so desolate.

780
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:22,560
Shall we do some gardening?

781
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,391
Why waste the time and effort?

782
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:30,363
We'll be back to China very soon.

783
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:35,871
Actually, I don't quite approve...

784
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:41,775
that you moved everything from Shanghai.

785
01:09:46,986 --> 01:09:51,047
Alright, let me just change the photo.

786
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:13,630
She looked at this lonely soldier.

787
01:11:14,874 --> 01:11:19,208
Does he understand her lonely youth?

788
01:11:20,746 --> 01:11:22,111
Sometimes,

789
01:11:22,315 --> 01:11:25,079
even she feels
she does not understand herself.

790
01:11:26,285 --> 01:11:27,843
She is from a...

791
01:11:28,054 --> 01:11:30,022
family of wealth.

792
01:11:30,456 --> 01:11:32,924
Yet she feels that she has nothing.

793
01:11:34,827 --> 01:11:36,317
She wants to share,

794
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:38,459
but she wants to possess too.

795
01:11:38,664 --> 01:11:42,361
The accused Chang, female, aged 31,

796
01:11:42,635 --> 01:11:44,500
a clerk at the Taipei Stationery Company,

797
01:11:44,704 --> 01:11:47,502
a member of "Patriotic Youth Association".

798
01:11:47,773 --> 01:11:49,331
Among Taipei students,

799
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:52,869
she tried to recruit young people.

800
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:54,706
to spy for the Communists.

801
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:56,176
Sentenced to the death.

802
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,275
She is a revolutionary,

803
01:12:00,786 --> 01:12:03,380
but can't help being Bourgeois.

804
01:12:04,423 --> 01:12:07,415
She appreciates the simplicity
of lndanthrene,

805
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:11,721
but she can't stop loving the softness
of fine silk.

806
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:16,896
The decadence of beautiful things
& the pain of the truth,

807
01:12:17,203 --> 01:12:18,727
she wants them all.

808
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:23,706
She desires too much. She started
to blame herself.

809
01:13:08,854 --> 01:13:09,878
Zhang.

810
01:13:38,884 --> 01:13:40,044
Please give this letter...

811
01:13:40,252 --> 01:13:41,947
to Mr. Li of the Dongfeng Bookstore.

812
01:13:44,757 --> 01:13:45,781
And please tell him that...

813
01:13:46,392 --> 01:13:47,791
I can't attend...

814
01:13:47,993 --> 01:13:49,460
the literature meeting this Thursday.

815
01:13:49,695 --> 01:13:50,992
Yes, Madam.

816
01:13:51,964 --> 01:13:53,158
Zhang...

817
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:02,567
That's all.

818
01:15:06,438 --> 01:15:08,429
How's everything? Bro Chiang

819
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:09,437
I have it.

820
01:15:09,642 --> 01:15:10,404
Please keep it.

821
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:11,806
Thanks.

822
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:16,203
This is very urgent.

823
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:18,948
Please sent it as soon as possible.

824
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:22,120
Sure, no problem.

825
01:15:22,454 --> 01:15:23,512
Thanks.

826
01:15:33,332 --> 01:15:36,062
Yesterday Zhou...

827
01:15:36,268 --> 01:15:38,395
was here with Rainbow.

828
01:15:38,604 --> 01:15:43,337
I cannot complain,
because she is with General's daughter.

829
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:49,674
Poor Mr. Sun and his family!

830
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,816
Sun has a pretty wife.

831
01:15:53,519 --> 01:15:55,077
But it caused his buddy's betrayal.

832
01:15:56,655 --> 01:16:00,091
Ding filed a charge against Sun
in the Commander's office.

833
01:16:01,894 --> 01:16:05,421
Spying is such a serious crime.

834
01:16:06,065 --> 01:16:07,726
Sun is dead for sure.

835
01:16:10,169 --> 01:16:13,297
But why was the woman arrested too?

836
01:16:14,206 --> 01:16:15,696
It was to make the show perfect.

837
01:16:17,276 --> 01:16:18,971
You know what kind of person Ding is.

838
01:16:20,779 --> 01:16:26,411
I think, the woman...she will be fine,

839
01:16:27,419 --> 01:16:28,886
and she will be his woman later.

840
01:16:50,142 --> 01:16:51,074
Zhang.

841
01:16:51,477 --> 01:16:52,739
Yes, General.

842
01:16:54,046 --> 01:16:57,675
Where did Madam go yesterday?

843
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:02,182
She went for a movie in the afternoon.

844
01:17:02,888 --> 01:17:06,551
Then she went to shop for some fabric.

845
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,493
Didn't she go to the Women's Association?

846
01:17:09,995 --> 01:17:11,053
No, General.

847
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:14,694
Not very much a General's wife.

848
01:17:15,434 --> 01:17:19,131
Is Zhou always here for fun?

849
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:20,999
Yes, General.

850
01:17:21,206 --> 01:17:23,231
Is Rainbow very fond of her?

851
01:17:24,176 --> 01:17:25,541
Yes, General.

852
01:17:26,445 --> 01:17:31,576
Tell Madam not to read "Free China".

853
01:17:36,355 --> 01:17:41,054
This garden seems to be desolate.

854
01:17:42,928 --> 01:17:44,691
Madam is right.

855
01:17:45,864 --> 01:17:48,025
I think it is time to do some gardening.

856
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:50,991
Yes, General.

857
01:18:01,613 --> 01:18:03,478
Sis, are you doing well here?

858
01:18:03,716 --> 01:18:04,683
I am fine.

859
01:18:06,618 --> 01:18:07,915
Let me tell you a secret.

860
01:18:08,654 --> 01:18:12,317
Uncle Ding turned in dad.

861
01:18:14,026 --> 01:18:17,860
Dad was executed because of Uncle Ding.

862
01:18:18,697 --> 01:18:20,426
It's because Uncle Ding fell for mom.

863
01:18:25,504 --> 01:18:27,028
Never tell the others.

864
01:18:37,316 --> 01:18:39,614
Why are you so quiet?

865
01:18:41,053 --> 01:18:42,782
You're a spy,

866
01:18:42,988 --> 01:18:44,546
you filed a report that sent my dad
to his death.

867
01:18:50,662 --> 01:18:52,186
How do you know your father is dead?

868
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:54,964
I saw the execution at the Dry River.

869
01:18:57,569 --> 01:18:58,593
Who took you there?

870
01:18:58,804 --> 01:19:00,499
Auntie Liu and her driver.

871
01:19:12,317 --> 01:19:15,184
Now I will file a report on Auntie Liu
and her driver.

872
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:32,263
How was your test today?

873
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:33,435
Not bad.

874
01:19:33,906 --> 01:19:34,873
Miss, excuse me, I have to go now.

875
01:19:36,742 --> 01:19:37,538
Mom, I am back.

876
01:19:37,743 --> 01:19:39,040
Good evening, Auntie Liu.

877
01:19:39,745 --> 01:19:40,211
Good girl.

878
01:19:40,412 --> 01:19:41,436
Is that for me?

879
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,439
Yes,

880
01:19:43,048 --> 01:19:45,642
I made some sandwiches for you.

881
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:46,612
After the snack,

882
01:19:46,819 --> 01:19:48,218
you can go for a movie.

883
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,114
Bravo!

884
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,687
So, let's hurry up
and finish our homework.

885
01:19:53,892 --> 01:19:54,324
Sure!

886
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,852
Try this dress first.

887
01:19:56,061 --> 01:19:56,755
Ok!

888
01:19:59,264 --> 01:20:01,323
Auntie Liu, you are beautiful!

889
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:08,030
Zhou, I have a present for you too.

890
01:20:08,807 --> 01:20:10,001
See if you like it or not.

891
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,408
Open it now.

892
01:20:15,247 --> 01:20:16,339
"Prince of Tears"

893
01:20:19,451 --> 01:20:21,351
This is our little secret,

894
01:20:22,054 --> 01:20:23,578
only you and I know.

895
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:25,616
Thank you, Auntie Liu.

896
01:20:32,698 --> 01:20:34,290
What a beautiful sunset.

897
01:20:37,269 --> 01:20:39,328
Will your mom take you see the sunset?

898
01:20:39,938 --> 01:20:43,032
No, but Daddy did.

899
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:48,469
Rainbow, how do you like it?

900
01:20:48,847 --> 01:20:51,543
Mom, it looks nice! I love pink.

901
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:52,808
I know.

902
01:20:53,452 --> 01:20:55,352
What did you put in the schoolbag?

903
01:20:56,355 --> 01:20:58,084
Nothing.

904
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:02,489
Mom, can I wear this to the movie?

905
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:06,428
Sure, but take care of it.

906
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,397
This girl is Zhang Xiao-Yan.

907
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:26,871
She won prizes at the Film Festivals.
She acts very well.

908
01:22:43,228 --> 01:22:44,286
Hello!

909
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,598
Yes...

910
01:22:55,774 --> 01:22:56,866
Yang...

911
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:09,511
Phoenix, come here.

912
01:23:10,255 --> 01:23:14,521
Auntie, I didn't do anything wrong.

913
01:23:15,427 --> 01:23:17,395
Come here,

914
01:23:17,596 --> 01:23:19,564
I want to check your temperature.
Do you have a fever?

915
01:23:19,898 --> 01:23:22,924
No, I do not.

916
01:23:23,769 --> 01:23:24,861
General.

917
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,251
I am sorry...

918
01:23:43,455 --> 01:23:45,423
I've broken your vase.

919
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:23,454
That night she knew her time had come.

920
01:24:25,163 --> 01:24:28,894
She left her daughter the necklace.

921
01:24:30,035 --> 01:24:33,971
It has 266 pearls,

922
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:35,972
a family treasure.

923
01:25:25,624 --> 01:25:27,751
Come back...

924
01:25:54,519 --> 01:25:55,645
Hurry up!

925
01:26:52,177 --> 01:26:54,077
Is it silly that I cry like this?

926
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:55,644
Nonsense!

927
01:27:18,403 --> 01:27:21,463
Zhou, let me take you home.

928
01:27:21,773 --> 01:27:23,832
No, thanks, I can go home alone.

929
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:27,401
Rainbow, see you tomorrow at the statue.

930
01:27:27,746 --> 01:27:29,680
All right, see you.

931
01:27:29,881 --> 01:27:32,611
- Miss, let's go. - See you!

932
01:27:38,723 --> 01:27:42,124
That night,
Madam Liu finally made her exit.

933
01:27:43,161 --> 01:27:45,527
She left behind her beauty and beliefs

934
01:27:46,331 --> 01:27:48,458
in a blurring ambiguity.

935
01:28:17,395 --> 01:28:19,727
Zhou, why are you still standing here?

936
01:28:19,931 --> 01:28:21,057
Go to class.

937
01:28:52,931 --> 01:28:55,229
Why isn't Rainbow here today?

938
01:28:55,433 --> 01:28:58,231
Mom won't allow me to talk.

939
01:29:03,942 --> 01:29:08,436
Rainbow then disappeared in Zhou's life.

940
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:15,781
People said Madame Ou-Yang Liu
was a Communist spy.

941
01:29:16,421 --> 01:29:19,720
General Liu
was sent to the military court too.

942
01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:23,955
Rainbow was sent to
the "Woman's Association for custody."

943
01:29:24,562 --> 01:29:27,759
They want to check
if she was influenced by her mother.

944
01:29:28,833 --> 01:29:31,893
People said,
the Communists are powerful...

945
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:35,971
at brain-washing kids.

946
01:29:37,509 --> 01:29:40,967
Zhou thought it was all her fault.

947
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:44,380
She felt that she was a sinner.

948
01:29:45,116 --> 01:29:47,016
Not unworthy of Rainbow's friendship,

949
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:19,815
Mom!

950
01:30:24,055 --> 01:30:25,215
Zhou.

951
01:30:34,499 --> 01:30:36,262
Let me take a good look at you!

952
01:30:39,537 --> 01:30:42,062
Oh, you look thin.

953
01:30:43,808 --> 01:30:45,605
Did you drink skim milk at school?

954
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:51,512
Has Uncle Ding taken good care of you?
Have you missed Mom?

955
01:31:03,228 --> 01:31:05,628
You grew bigger & taller.

956
01:31:16,141 --> 01:31:17,506
- Ping! - Uncle Ding!

957
01:31:20,445 --> 01:31:21,878
We will have extra dish tonight.

958
01:34:00,672 --> 01:34:01,661
Mom, I am back.

959
01:34:01,873 --> 01:34:02,999
You're home!

960
01:34:04,242 --> 01:34:05,607
Did you pay attention well in class?

961
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:06,777
Yes.

962
01:34:07,879 --> 01:34:08,743
Li come here,

963
01:34:08,946 --> 01:34:11,278
Iet me take a good look at you.

964
01:34:13,017 --> 01:34:14,985
You're going to high school,
are you prepared?

965
01:34:15,186 --> 01:34:16,778
I am ready.

966
01:34:16,988 --> 01:34:18,649
I just made 1 00 dumplings.

967
01:34:18,856 --> 01:34:21,051
Deliver them to Auntie Zhang's.

968
01:34:21,259 --> 01:34:23,887
Remember to let her sign the bill,
they are on credit.

969
01:34:24,128 --> 01:34:25,060
All right.

970
01:34:36,874 --> 01:34:38,102
Yes, coming.

971
01:34:42,647 --> 01:34:44,205
Hi, Ding.

972
01:34:44,515 --> 01:34:45,573
Ping.

973
01:34:45,783 --> 01:34:46,875
Look, you are too generous

974
01:34:49,654 --> 01:34:50,916
Are you busy making money?

975
01:34:52,423 --> 01:34:54,186
How many dumplings can you sell a day?

976
01:34:54,592 --> 01:34:56,787
About seven to eight hundred a day.

977
01:34:58,463 --> 01:35:01,227
Give me the laundry,
I'll ask Li to do for you.

978
01:35:01,666 --> 01:35:05,625
Li, come over. The laundry first,

979
01:35:05,837 --> 01:35:07,134
the dumplings later.

980
01:35:09,607 --> 01:35:10,835
Please go inside.

981
01:35:11,142 --> 01:35:13,440
Where is Zhou?

982
01:35:14,612 --> 01:35:15,909
I just saw her.

983
01:36:18,776 --> 01:36:21,836
Li is a big girl now.

984
01:36:23,214 --> 01:36:25,182
I'd like to send her study in the city.

985
01:36:25,983 --> 01:36:27,143
What do you think?

986
01:36:36,294 --> 01:36:39,092
This is a good idea.

987
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:19,636
Would you go inside?

988
01:37:30,515 --> 01:37:31,709
Mom, I am back.

989
01:37:36,153 --> 01:37:37,347
You're home

990
01:37:48,666 --> 01:37:49,997
We are discussing...

991
01:37:50,201 --> 01:37:51,964
Li's schooling.

992
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:55,870
Have you greeted Uncle Ding yet?

993
01:37:56,073 --> 01:37:57,062
Uncle Ding.

994
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:01,903
Uncle Ding has a friend in the city.

995
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,941
Li can...

996
01:38:04,148 --> 01:38:05,615
stay with them.

997
01:38:09,086 --> 01:38:10,348
Li come here.

998
01:38:16,394 --> 01:38:17,383
Take this.

999
01:38:18,296 --> 01:38:20,321
Go and have some noodles.

1000
01:38:21,532 --> 01:38:23,591
You can go to a movie later.

1001
01:38:24,235 --> 01:38:25,532
Don't be too late.

1002
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:27,628
We'll get changed.

1003
01:38:36,547 --> 01:38:39,516
I just want to let you know,
Ding and I are getting married.

1004
01:38:53,898 --> 01:38:58,426
Li, is Uncle Ding's shirt ready?

1005
01:39:06,644 --> 01:39:08,043
Why are you still wearing pajamas?

1006
01:39:08,546 --> 01:39:11,174
Go get changed,
we're going to take photos.

1007
01:39:18,389 --> 01:39:19,515
Move now.

1008
01:39:21,392 --> 01:39:25,385
Mom, it's always Uncle Ding's laundry.
Have you got anything else to say?

1009
01:39:27,365 --> 01:39:29,560
They are right,
you're finally going to marry Ding.

1010
01:39:34,505 --> 01:39:36,735
I just want you to iron the shirt.

1011
01:39:38,142 --> 01:39:39,939
Why did you say such a thing to me?

1012
01:39:41,245 --> 01:39:42,371
Mom, everbody...

1013
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:44,343
is talking behind us?

1014
01:39:44,582 --> 01:39:45,606
They are laughing at us!

1015
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,875
Because of you,
Uncle Ding sent dad to jail.

1016
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,585
And Dad was shot dead.

1017
01:39:52,323 --> 01:39:53,620
He killed Dad,

1018
01:39:54,025 --> 01:39:55,993
now he wants to sleep in Dad's bed.

1019
01:39:57,595 --> 01:40:00,587
I just can't stand it.

1020
01:40:03,634 --> 01:40:06,467
What happened to you?

1021
01:40:26,991 --> 01:40:28,686
Li, come here.

1022
01:40:38,502 --> 01:40:40,936
You know why I do this.

1023
01:40:46,777 --> 01:40:49,746
I just want you girls to live better.

1024
01:40:54,452 --> 01:40:56,010
You think I know nothing...

1025
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:57,983
of the gossip?

1026
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:02,482
So what if this is true?

1027
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:08,125
It's history.

1028
01:41:10,367 --> 01:41:12,392
We have to survive anyway.

1029
01:41:18,476 --> 01:41:24,005
That time you came to see me in custody.
I scolded you,

1030
01:41:28,085 --> 01:41:29,643
your father returned
to the Communist zone,

1031
01:41:30,688 --> 01:41:33,213
all because of you.

1032
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:37,992
That's why he was charged with spying.

1033
01:41:44,101 --> 01:41:46,035
I never said a harsh word to you before,

1034
01:41:47,905 --> 01:41:50,203
because you were not born by me.

1035
01:41:54,745 --> 01:41:59,648
That was the first time I scolded you
and I regretted.

1036
01:42:14,398 --> 01:42:17,333
Mom is just an ordinary woman.

1037
01:42:18,502 --> 01:42:22,336
I just want you girls to live better.

1038
01:42:25,042 --> 01:42:33,245
Mom, I am sorry...

1039
01:42:33,751 --> 01:42:35,946
Do you understand, Li?

1040
01:42:53,704 --> 01:42:55,069
Are you ready?

1041
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,205
Yes, we are ready.

1042
01:42:58,642 --> 01:42:59,734
Let's go.

1043
01:43:22,766 --> 01:43:27,066
"Story of lost lovers"

1044
01:44:03,407 --> 01:44:06,308
Li, take good care of your sister.

1045
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:07,408
Yes.

1046
01:44:07,611 --> 01:44:08,475
Ding.

1047
01:44:09,914 --> 01:44:10,778
Are you ready?

1048
01:44:11,148 --> 01:44:12,137
Coming.

1049
01:44:15,486 --> 01:44:17,351
Send them to school now, don't be late.

1050
01:44:18,589 --> 01:44:19,851
Let's go to school now.

1051
01:44:22,426 --> 01:44:23,393
Take care.

1052
01:44:23,594 --> 01:44:24,959
- Goodbye, Mom. - See you, Mom.

1053
01:44:27,831 --> 01:44:30,857
Don't make supper, let's eat out.

1054
01:44:33,203 --> 01:44:34,397
Come back early.

1055
01:46:48,605 --> 01:46:52,097
You're back! I missed you.

1056
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:56,468
Where have you been?

1057
01:47:58,509 --> 01:48:00,409
How have you been?

1058
01:48:17,461 --> 01:48:19,895
Since our seperation,

1059
01:48:20,097 --> 01:48:21,792
I was imprisoned on Green lsland.

1060
01:48:23,267 --> 01:48:24,996
I always thought I would see you again.

1061
01:48:26,904 --> 01:48:28,428
But then one day,

1062
01:48:31,341 --> 01:48:34,208
my heart broke.

1063
01:48:35,445 --> 01:48:37,470
And that was the day you were executed.

1064
01:48:49,526 --> 01:48:51,551
I almost gave up my desire to live.

1065
01:48:59,236 --> 01:49:01,534
Until I received Ding's first letter,

1066
01:49:08,178 --> 01:49:09,509
I could...

1067
01:49:10,047 --> 01:49:12,743
never forgive myself
for Han-Sun's death.

1068
01:49:14,384 --> 01:49:16,784
He urged me to prove his innocence.

1069
01:49:17,788 --> 01:49:19,813
Such a simple request,

1070
01:49:20,857 --> 01:49:22,654
but I refused to do so.

1071
01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:27,424
When I found out the verdict.

1072
01:49:28,665 --> 01:49:30,656
It was too late to reverse the judgment.

1073
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:33,863
On that day, I accompanied him
to the execution ground.

1074
01:49:34,838 --> 01:49:36,863
I gave him a last drink of wine.

1075
01:49:38,942 --> 01:49:40,842
I didn't see hatred in his eyes.

1076
01:49:42,846 --> 01:49:44,837
Bearing an unforgivable guilt.

1077
01:49:46,416 --> 01:49:48,247
I tidied everything for him.

1078
01:49:50,687 --> 01:49:52,552
I know Li has always disliked me.

1079
01:49:54,091 --> 01:49:56,025
But how can I tell her that...

1080
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:00,287
I was burnt because of saving her?

1081
01:50:01,865 --> 01:50:03,389
That fire...

1082
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:07,293
Burnt my ambition and made me what I am.

1083
01:50:09,606 --> 01:50:11,471
Do you remember Ou-Yang?

1084
01:50:12,776 --> 01:50:17,008
When Han-Sun and I met you.
You two were best friends.

1085
01:50:19,216 --> 01:50:21,480
Now, your children too.

1086
01:50:23,754 --> 01:50:25,722
One night I found "Prince of Tears."

1087
01:50:27,057 --> 01:50:29,150
Zhou said it was a gift from Ou-Yang.

1088
01:50:30,827 --> 01:50:32,021
I flipped through the pages.

1089
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:35,164
It was a comic book from our youth.

1090
01:50:36,199 --> 01:50:39,862
It survived the Japanese invasion.
It went through the Communists.

1091
01:50:41,438 --> 01:50:44,032
Now, it appears in our remote village.

1092
01:50:47,244 --> 01:50:48,609
"Prince of Tears"

1093
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:54,740
It sounds so long ago.

1094
01:50:56,887 --> 01:50:58,684
Because of this book,

1095
01:51:00,524 --> 01:51:02,492
Ou-Yang guided me to the

1096
01:51:02,693 --> 01:51:04,684
"Progressive Reading Society".

1097
01:51:10,467 --> 01:51:12,731
She wanted me to be progressive.

1098
01:51:13,837 --> 01:51:16,772
And I was so attached to her.

1099
01:51:44,334 --> 01:51:45,562
Long time no see!

1100
01:51:50,707 --> 01:51:53,574
I never thought we meet again.

1101
01:51:58,749 --> 01:51:59,875
You loved her.

1102
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,393
I love only you.

1103
01:52:15,298 --> 01:52:16,765
My daughter told me that...

1104
01:52:18,535 --> 01:52:20,332
Zhou is her classmate,

1105
01:52:21,405 --> 01:52:22,963
she likes her very much.

1106
01:52:30,113 --> 01:52:33,913
Do you remember...

1107
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:41,113
how we met?

1108
01:52:47,164 --> 01:52:48,529
That time,

1109
01:52:51,034 --> 01:52:53,730
you picked up my book "Prince of Tears."

1110
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:00,241
You asked me
why is it named "Prince of Tears."

1111
01:53:02,879 --> 01:53:04,141
I said,

1112
01:53:05,849 --> 01:53:09,785
because the Prince saw
and hated the injustices of the society,

1113
01:53:11,021 --> 01:53:12,648
so tears filled his eyes.

1114
01:53:14,624 --> 01:53:19,027
You said, just so simple?

1115
01:53:23,767 --> 01:53:24,995
I said...

1116
01:53:28,705 --> 01:53:33,369
tears are the beginning of the story.

1117
01:53:36,813 --> 01:53:38,041
Afterwards...

1118
01:53:41,151 --> 01:53:42,618
everything will be changed.

1119
01:54:02,172 --> 01:54:03,571
On that day,

1120
01:54:05,542 --> 01:54:07,976
we leaned on to each other.

1121
01:54:10,313 --> 01:54:14,841
She turned the pages one by one

1122
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:20,879
and explained the meaning...

1123
01:54:21,992 --> 01:54:28,261
of each picture to me
the hidden meaning behind the words...

1124
01:54:30,901 --> 01:54:38,137
and the pictures.

1125
01:54:44,748 --> 01:54:46,238
Do you recall her name?

1126
01:54:55,425 --> 01:54:57,086
Ou-Yang Qian-Jun.

1127
01:55:07,237 --> 01:55:10,468
I betrayed her, and betrayed you.

1128
01:55:14,144 --> 01:55:16,237
When people look at me,

1129
01:55:17,414 --> 01:55:20,872
Their eyes are telling me...

1130
01:55:26,389 --> 01:55:28,380
you betrayed the man who loved you,

1131
01:55:29,159 --> 01:55:30,490
and the friend who trusted you,

1132
01:55:31,728 --> 01:55:35,687
Then, married a man
who brought down your family.

1133
01:56:11,267 --> 01:56:14,794
Once again Ping hears
that familiar accordion.

1134
01:56:15,705 --> 01:56:18,799
There is a nameless sorrow in her heart.

1135
01:56:19,976 --> 01:56:23,343
She knows Han-Sun will never return
after this visit.

1136
01:56:23,813 --> 01:56:25,872
And she misses him so.

1137
01:56:29,352 --> 01:56:34,153
In a trance,
she returns to the day they were arrested.

1138
01:56:35,158 --> 01:56:36,716
She sits in the kitchen.

1139
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,690
Listens to the music.

1140
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:43,756
Rolls some cigarettes for Han-Sun.

1141
01:56:54,444 --> 01:56:56,036
I love your music.

1142
01:57:01,351 --> 01:57:02,716
I love your simplicity.

1143
01:57:05,622 --> 01:57:06,987
I love your honesty.

1144
01:57:09,859 --> 01:57:11,258
I love you...

1145
01:57:13,363 --> 01:57:14,853
till the end of the world.

1146
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,899
Why do you make so many cigarettes?

1147
01:57:32,315 --> 01:57:33,782
You'll leave on a mission soon.

1148
01:57:36,019 --> 01:57:37,816
So better bring more with you.

1149
01:57:45,228 --> 01:57:46,490
Why is it so noisy out there?

1150
01:57:54,204 --> 01:57:57,640
Let's take a look.

1151
01:58:17,093 --> 01:58:19,288
And she will never forget

1152
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:26,260
his last glance before parting.

1153
01:58:32,142 --> 01:58:33,268
The story...

1154
01:58:33,476 --> 01:58:37,537
floats away.

1155
01:58:38,448 --> 01:58:41,849
One still clings to it.

1156
01:58:42,752 --> 01:58:45,778
And one can only rely on hope now.

1157
01:59:02,472 --> 01:59:04,133
Han-Sun returned today.

1158
01:59:07,977 --> 01:59:11,469
From 1 950 to 1 954 during
the martial law era in Taiwan

1159
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:17,210
Over 3000 people were sentenced to death,
and more than 8000 were jailed.

1160
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:21,618
Their aggregate prison terms
exceeded 1 0,000 years.

1161
01:59:24,694 --> 01:59:29,757
This movie is based on a true story.

1162
01:59:33,102 --> 01:59:36,367
The father was executed in 1 954 accused
of treason & re-established in 2005.

1163
01:59:36,573 --> 01:59:39,098
His remains are yet to be found.

1164
01:59:42,078 --> 01:59:44,444
The mother remarried in 1 956
and had two more children.

1165
01:59:44,647 --> 01:59:48,174
She is 86 and still lives in Taiwan.

1166
01:59:50,987 --> 01:59:53,683
Ding married Ping and spent
his life quietly in Taichung

1167
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:57,656
and died in 1992 at the age of 79.

1168
02:00:00,563 --> 02:00:05,830
Li has had a happy family life in Taipei
with two children.

1169
02:00:08,271 --> 02:00:13,004
Zhou became an actress
and was a top star in the 1960s.

1170
02:00:15,311 --> 02:00:19,805
It's all by-gones.
